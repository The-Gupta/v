Although chromatin targeting is a crucial function of Brd4, there is little understanding of how bromodomains that bind acetylated histones are regulated, nor how the gene-specific activity of Brd4 is determined. Via interaction screen and domain mapping, we identified p53 as a functional partner of Brd4. Interestingly, Brd4 association with p53 is modulated by casein kinase II (CK2)-mediated phosphorylation of a conserved acidic region in Brd4 that selectively contacts either a juxtaposed bromodomain or an adjacent basic region to dictate the ability of Brd4 binding to chromatin and also the recruitment of p53 to regulated promoters. The unmasking of bromodomains and activator recruitment, concurrently triggered by the CK2 phospho switch, provide an intriguing mechanism for gene-specific targeting by a universal epigenetic reader.",['Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

The frequency of various FO can vary in different ethnic groups, with important implications for prognosis, drug selection and treatment outcome. METHOD: We studied fusion oncogenes in 101 pediatric ALL patients using interphase FISH and RT-PCR, and their associations with clinical features and treatment outcome. RESULTS: Five most common fusion genes i.e. BCR-ABL t (22; 9), TCF3-PBX1 (t 1; 19), ETV6-RUNX1 (t 12; 21), MLL-AF4 (t 4; 11) and SIL-TAL1 (del 1p32) were found in 89/101 (88.1%) patients. Frequency of BCR-ABL was 44.5% (45/101). BCR-ABL positive patients had a significantly lower survival (43.7+/-4.24 weeks) and higher white cell count as compared to others, except patients with MLL-AF4. The highest relapse-free survival was documented with ETV6-RUNX1 (14.2 months) followed closely by those cases in which no gene was detected (13.100). RFS with BCR-ABL, MLL-AF4, TCF3-PBX1 and SIL-TAL1 was less than 10 months (8.0, 3.6, 5.5 and 8.1 months, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study from Pakistan correlating molecular markers with disease biology and treatment outcome in pediatric ALL. It revealed the highest reported frequency of BCR-ABL FO in pediatric ALL, associated with poor overall survival. Our data indicate an immediate need for incorporation of tyrosine kinase inhibitors in the treatment of BCR-ABL+ pediatric ALL in this population and the development of facilities for stem cell transplantation.",,"['Awan, Tashfeen', 'Iqbal, Zafar', 'Aleem, Aamer', 'Sabir, Noreen', 'Absar, Muhammad', 'Rasool, Mahmood', 'Tahir, Ammara H', 'Basit, Sulman', 'Khalid, Ahmad Mukhtar', 'Sabar, Muhammad Farooq', 'Asad, Sultan', 'Ali, Agha Shabbir', 'Mahmood, Amer', 'Akram, Muhammad', 'Saeed, Tariq', 'Saleem, Arsalan', 'Mohsin, Danish', 'Shah, Ijaz Hussain', 'Khalid, Muhammad', 'Asif, Muhammad', 'Haq, Riazul', 'Iqbal, Mudassar', 'Akhtar, Tanveer']","['Awan T', 'Iqbal Z', 'Aleem A', 'Sabir N', 'Absar M', 'Rasool M', 'Tahir AH', 'Basit S', 'Khalid AM', 'Sabar MF', 'Asad S', 'Ali AS', 'Mahmood A', 'Akram M', 'Saeed T', 'Saleem A', 'Mohsin D', 'Shah IH', 'Khalid M', 'Asif M', 'Haq R', 'Iqbal M', 'Akhtar T']","['Hematology, Oncology and Pharmacogenetic Engineering Sciences (HOPES) Group, Health Sciences Laboratories, Faculty of Biological Sciences, Department of Zoology, University of the Punjab, Pakistan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Thailand,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,101130625,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (MLL-AF4 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (SIL-TAL1 fusion protein, human)', '0 (TCF3-PBX1 fusion protein, human)', '0 (TEL-AML1 fusion protein)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*genetics', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Pakistan', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/mortality/therapy', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2013/01/16 06:00,2013/07/03 06:00,['2013/01/16 06:00'],"['2013/01/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/01/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.7314/apjcp.2012.13.11.5469 [doi]'],ppublish,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2012;13(11):5469-75. doi: 10.7314/apjcp.2012.13.11.5469.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study aimed to validate serum soluble human leukocyte antigen-G (sHLA-G) and serum soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R) as an additional tool for the diagnosis and follow up of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Both markers were determined by ELISA in the serum of 33 ALL pediatric patients before treatment and after intensification phase of chemotherapy as well as in the serum of 14 healthy donors that were selected as a control group. RESULTS: ALL patients showed abnormal CBC and high serum lactate dehydrogenase, which were improved after chemotherapy. Also, there was a non-significant increase in serum sHLA-G in ALL patients compared with the control group. However, after chemotherapy, sHLA-G was increased significantly compared with before treatment. On the other hand, serum sIL-2R in ALL patients was increased significantly compared with the control group. After chemotherapy, sIL-2R decreased significantly compared with before treatment.

Bufalin is a cardiotonic steroid that has the potential to induce differentiation and apoptosis of tumor cells. Research on bufalin has so far mainly involved leukemia, prostate cancer, gastric cancer and liver cancer, and has been confined to in vitro studies. The bufadienolides bufalin and cinobufagin have been shown to induce apoptosis in a wide spectrum of cancer cell. The present article reviews the anticancer effects of bufalin. It induces apoptosis of lung cancer cells via the PI3K/Akt pathway and also suppressed the proliferation of human non-small cell lung cancer A549 cell line in a time and dose dependent manner. Bufalin, bufotalin and gamabufotalin, key bufadienolides, significantly sensitize human breast cancer cells with differing ER-alpha status to apoptosis induction by the TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL). In addition, bufadienolides induce prostate cancer cell apoptosis more significantly than that in breast epithelial cell lines. Similar effects have been observed with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) but the detailed molecular mechanisms of inducing apoptosis in this case are still unclear. Bufalin exerts profound effects on leukemia therapy in vitro. Results of multiple studies indicate that bufalin has marked anti-tumor activities through its ability to induce apoptosis.

Because of its volatility and solvent properties, it was used in the printing industry in inks, ink solvents, and cleaning agents from the 1930s to the 1970s. This analysis represents the first known attempt to gather and synthesize the available data on historical airborne benzene concentrations in printing facilities and exposures to pressmen. The sources of fugitive benzene vapors from printing operations have been identified as evaporation from ink fountains, exposed sections of the printing cylinder, the paper web, the paper post exit, and spilled ink. In addition, specific activities that could lead to benzene exposure, such as filling the fountains, using solvents to clean the press, and using solvents as personal cleaning agents, potentially occurred multiple times per work period. Eighteen studies were identified that reported workplace airborne concentrations in printing facilities between 1938 and 2006. Typical benzene air concentrations, considering both personal and area samples of various durations, were as high as 200 p.p.m. in the 1930s through the 1950s, 3-35 p.p.m. in the 1960s, 1.3-16 p.p.m. in the 1970s, 0.013-1 in the 1980s, and far less than 1 p.p.m. in the 1990s and 2000s.

An understanding of the evolutionary aspects of HSV infection is crucial to the design of effective therapeutic and control strategies. METHODS: Eight sequential HSV-1 isolates were recovered from an HSCT patient who suffered from recurrent herpetic gingivostomatitis and was treated alternatively with acyclovir, ganciclovir, and foscavir. The diverse spectra and temporal changes of HSV drug resistance were determined phenotypically (drug-resistance profiling) and genotypically (sequencing of the viral thymidine kinase and DNA polymerase genes). RESULTS: Analysis of 60 clones recovered from the different isolates demonstrated that most of these isolates were heterogeneous mixtures of variants, indicating the simultaneous infection with different drug-resistant viruses. The phenotype/genotype of several clones associated with resistance to acyclovir and/or foscavir were identified. Two novel mutations (E798K and I922T) in the viral DNA polymerase could be linked to drug resistance. CONCLUSIONS: The heterogeneity within the viral populations and the temporal changes of drug-resistant viruses found in this HSCT recipient were remarkable, showing a rapid evolution of HSV-1.

Cases of NCPH have been reported in HIV-negative individuals as result of treatment with thiopurines for leukemia or inflammatory bowel disease. Exposure to didanosine, which is also a purine analogue, predisposes to NCPH in the HIV setting. However, it is unclear why NCPH only develops in a small subset of didanosine-treated patients. METHODS: A multicenter, case-control study was conducted to investigate the role of pharmacogenomics in NCPH in HIV patients with prior didanosine exposure. Three controls were chosen for each case, adjusted for sex, age, CD4 counts, plasma HIV-RNA, and site. Tagging 36 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at enzymes involved in the purine metabolism (inosine triphosphatase, 5'-nucleotidase cytosolic-II, purine nucleoside phosphorylase and xanthine oxidase) was performed using SNPlex microarray technology. RESULTS: Eighty individuals were examined; 22 with NCPH and 58 matched controls. Two SNPs at the 5'-nucleotidase gene were associated with NCPH: rs11191561 (48% CG/GG vs 17% CC; P=.003) and rs11598702 (40% CC/CT vs 9% TT; P=.003). SNPs at another 2 loci at the xanthine oxidase gene were also associated with NCPH: rs1429376 (71% AA vs 23% CC/AC; P=.015) and rs1594160 (71% AA vs 23% CC/AC; P=.015). There was a cumulative risk of NCPH for these 4 SNPs: 7%, 26%, 42%, 50%, and 100%, respectively, for 0, 1, 2, 3, or all SNPs (P=.001).

But the carcinogenicity to human was uncertain based on population studies. A systematic review was conducted to explore two kinds of associations, one was between the workers exposed to PCP with lymphoma and hematopoietic neoplasm, the other was between childhood lymphoma and leukemia with their parents exposed to PCP. METHODS: Systematic search for epidemiologic studies was carried out and the data were collected from MEDLINE database and from the reference lists of relevant studies. Data were extracted from 20 included studies published between 1986 and 2012. RESULTS: The meta-analysis suggested a significant association between lymphoma and workers' occupational exposing to PCP, for the pooled odds ratio = 2.57 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.52-4.35). The subgroup analysis indicated significant association for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, but not for Hodgkin's disease. The cohort studies also showed comparatively higher relative risk (RR) and standardized mortality ratio (SMR). Two of the cohort studies found increased RR as the cumulative exposure time added. Another cohort study discovered that the white males had significantly elevated non-Hodgkin's lymphoma mortality (SMR = 1.98, 95% CI = 1.15-3.17), and males of other races had increased leukemia mortality (SMR = 4.57, 95% CI = 1.25-11.7). For the relationship of childhood leukemia and parental exposure to PCP, three published studies suggested an increased risk of childhood leukemia because of their parental exposure to PCP at the preconception period. CONCLUSION: Our review provided the evidence that occupational exposure of workers to PCP might increase the risk of lymphoma and hematopoietic neoplasm in themselves and in their children.",['(c) The Author(s) 2012.'],"['Zheng, Ruizhi', 'Zhang, Qian', 'Zhang, Qinghe', 'Yang, Linsheng', 'Zhang, Zhihua', 'Huang, Fen']","['Zheng R', 'Zhang Q', 'Zhang Q', 'Yang L', 'Zhang Z', 'Huang F']","['Department of Epidemiology and Health Statistics, Public Health of Anhui Medical University, Hefei, China Contributed equally.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Health Statistics, Public Health of Anhui Medical University, Hefei, China Contributed equally.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Health Statistics, Public Health of Anhui Medical University, Hefei, China.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Health Statistics, Public Health of Anhui Medical University, Hefei, China.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Health Statistics, Public Health of Anhui Medical University, Hefei, China.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Health Statistics, Public Health of Anhui Medical University, Hefei, China hf0550@yahoo.com.cn.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",20130111,England,Toxicol Ind Health,Toxicology and industrial health,8602702,"['0 (Mutagens)', 'D9BSU0SE4T (Pentachlorophenol)']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Lymphoma/*chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Maternal Exposure', 'Mutagens/*poisoning', 'Occupational Diseases/*chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Occupational Exposure/*statistics & numerical data', 'Odds Ratio', 'Paternal Exposure', 'Pentachlorophenol/*poisoning']",,,2013/01/15 06:00,2016/01/14 06:00,['2013/01/15 06:00'],"['2013/01/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/14 06:00 [medline]']","['0748233712472520 [pii]', '10.1177/0748233712472520 [doi]']",ppublish,Toxicol Ind Health. 2015 Apr;31(4):328-42. doi: 10.1177/0748233712472520.

The mechanism may involve the concerted action of multiple antiretroviral effectors collectively known as ""restriction factors,"" which could vary in relative importance according to the magnitude of transcriptional induction. However, direct genetic approaches to identify the relevant IFN-alpha restriction factors will not be feasible in humans in vivo. Meanwhile, mice encode an analogous set of restriction factor genes and could be used to obtain insights on how IFN-alpha could inhibit retroviruses in vivo. As expected, IFN-alpha treatment of mice significantly upregulated the transcription of multiple restriction factors including Tetherin/BST2, SAMHD1, Viperin, ISG15, OAS1, and IFITM3. However, a dominant antiretroviral factor, Apobec3, was only minimally induced. To determine whether Apobec3 was necessary for direct IFN-alpha antiretroviral action in vivo, wild-type and Apobec3-deficient mice were infected with Friend retrovirus, then treated with IFN-alpha. Treatment of infected wild-type mice with IFN-alpha significantly reduced acute plasma viral load 28-fold, splenic proviral load 5-fold, bone marrow proviral load 14-fold, and infected bone marrow cells 7-fold, but no inhibition was observed in Apobec3-deficient mice. These findings reveal that IFN-alpha inhibits acute Friend retrovirus infection primarily through the antiviral effector Apobec3 in vivo, demonstrate that transcriptional induction levels did not predict the mechanism of IFN-alpha-mediated control, and highlight the potential of the human APOBEC3 proteins as therapeutic targets against pathogenic retrovirus infections.",,"['Harper, Michael S', 'Barrett, Bradley S', 'Smith, Diana S', 'Li, Sam X', 'Gibbert, Kathrin', 'Dittmer, Ulf', 'Hasenkrug, Kim J', 'Santiago, Mario L']","['Harper MS', 'Barrett BS', 'Smith DS', 'Li SX', 'Gibbert K', 'Dittmer U', 'Hasenkrug KJ', 'Santiago ML']","['Department of Medicine, University of Colorado Denver, Aurora, CO 80045, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 AI090795/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'TL1 TR000155/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM008497/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'TL1 TR001081/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 AI027763/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130111,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Ifna protein, mouse)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (Apobec3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (Cytidine Deaminase)']",IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Antiviral Agents/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytidine Deaminase/deficiency/genetics/*physiology', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/*immunology/pathogenicity', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Retroviridae Infections/immunology/*therapy/*virology', 'Viremia/immunology/therapy/virology', 'Virus Replication/*immunology']",PMC3654153,['NIHMS430370'],2013/01/15 06:00,2013/03/30 06:00,['2013/01/15 06:00'],"['2013/01/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/30 06:00 [medline]']","['jimmunol.1202920 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1202920 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2013 Feb 15;190(4):1583-90. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1202920.

Expression levels of the pluripotency markers, POUV, Nanog, C-Myc, Sox-2 and Lin28 were the same as in uncultured stage X blastoderm cells, and most significantly, the formation of embryoid bodies (EBs) by 6th generation cESCs confirmed the ability of these cultured cESCs to differentiate into cells of all three embryonic germ layers.

RECENT FINDINGS: Survival after UCBT has improved considerably over the past 10 years. Multiple retrospective studies using either myeloablative or reduced intensity conditioning have shown disease-free survival after UCBT that is comparable to that of matched related or unrelated donors.

PI(4,5)P2 production at the plasma membrane (PM) depends on levels of its precursor, phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P), synthesized principally by two intracellular enzymes, PI4-kinases IIIalpha and IIIb; the former is preferentially inhibited by phenylarsine oxide (PAO). We found that PAO and quercetin, another lipid kinase inhibitor, rapidly inhibit Ca(2+) responses to antigen in IgE-sensitized rat basophilic leukemia mast cells. Quercetin also rapidly inhibits store-operated Ca(2+) influx stimulated by thapsigargin. In addition, quercetin and PAO effectively inhibit antigen-stimulated ruffling and spreading in these cells, and they inhibit endocytosis of crosslinked IgE receptor complexes, evidently by inhibiting pinching off of endocytic vesicles containing the clustered IgE receptors. A minimal model to account for these diverse effects is inhibition of PI(4,5)P2 synthesis by PAO and quercetin. To characterize the direct effects of these agents on PI(4,5)P2 synthesis, we monitored the reappearance of the PI(4,5)P2-specific PH domain PH-phospholipase C delta-EGFP at the PM after Ca(2+) ionophore (A23187)-induced PI(4,5)P2 hydrolysis, followed by Ca(2+) chelation with excess EGTA. Resynthesized PI(4,5)P2 initially appears as micron-sized patches near the PM. Addition of quercetin subsequent to A23187-induced PI(4,5)P2 hydrolysis reduces PI(4,5)P2 resynthesis in PM-associated patches, and PAO reduces PI(4,5)P2 at the PM while enhancing PI(4,5)P2 accumulation at the Golgi complex. Taken together, these results provide evidence that PI4P generated by PI4-kinase IIIalpha is dynamically coupled to PI(4,5)P2 pools at the PM that are important for downstream signaling processes activated by IgE receptors.",,"['Santos, Marcela de Souza', 'Naal, Rose Mary Zumstein Georgetto', 'Baird, Barbara', 'Holowka, David']","['Santos Mde S', 'Naal RM', 'Baird B', 'Holowka D']","['Departamento de Fisica e Quimica, Faculdade de Ciencias Farmaceuticas de Ribeirao Preto, Universidade de Sao Paulo, SaoPaulo, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['R01 AI022449/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01AI022449/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130111,United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-Diphosphate)', '0 (Phosphatidylinositols)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '0HUR2WY345 (oxophenylarsine)', '9IKM0I5T1E (Quercetin)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Arsenicals/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Mast Cells/drug effects/*metabolism/physiology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-Diphosphate/*antagonists & inhibitors/*biosynthesis', 'Phosphatidylinositols/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis', 'Quercetin/pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Receptors, IgE/metabolism/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/*physiology']",PMC3608441,,2013/01/15 06:00,2013/05/15 06:00,['2013/01/15 06:00'],"['2013/01/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/15 06:00 [medline]']","['mol.112.082834 [pii]', '10.1124/mol.112.082834 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 2013 Apr;83(4):793-804. doi: 10.1124/mol.112.082834.

DESIGNS AND METHODS: N-RAS and K-RAS were screened for mutations at hot-spot codons 12, 13 and 61 using high resolution melting analysis (HRMA) and direct DNA sequencing in 504 Chinese AML patients and their clinical relevance was analyzed. RESULTS: The frequencies of mutations of N-RAS and K-RAS were 9.7% (49/504) and 2.9% (15/504), respectively. c.35G>A (rs121913237: G>A; p.Gly12Asp and rs121913529: G>A; p.Gly12Asp) and c.38G>A (rs121434596: G>A; p.Gly13Asp and rs112445441: G>A; p.Gly13Asp) were the most common base substitutions (46% in N-RAS and 60% in K-RAS, respectively). AML patients with RAS mutations presented significantly higher white blood cell count (WBC) at diagnosis than those without mutations (p<0.001). RAS mutations were underrepresented in patients with t(15;17) (2.9%, p=0.01), while overrepresented in cases with abn11q23 (50%, p=0.002) and inv(16) (66.6%, p=0.04). In the FAB subtypes M4 and M5, RAS mutations were more frequent (21.6% and 20.6%, respectively) than they were in other subtypes (7.5%, p=0.006 and 0.005, respectively). FLT3-ITD and RAS mutation were rarely coexistent (p=0.03). RAS mutation didn't influence overall survival (OS) either in the entire cohort or within some defined subgroups.

Accumulation of leukemic lymphocytes in peripheral blood, bone marrow and secondary lymphatic organs of CLL patients is due to decreased apoptosis rather than to increased proliferation. The former is driven by signals from a specific microenvironment, created by stromal cells of mesenchymal origin, follicular dendritic cells, T lymphocytes and others. Nurse-like cells (NLCs) were first described to differentiate from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of CLL patients in vitro, then they have been also found in proliferation centers of their lymphatic tissues. Like tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in solid tumors, nurse-like cells promote survival of CLL lymphocytes. NLC gene expression patterns suggest their similarity to TAMs and differ between patients depending on ZAP70 protein expression status.

We examined sows of two Polish breeds, which are used as a dam line in Polish breeding: Large White and Landrace. The reproductive traits investigated were: number of piglets born alive (NBA), number of alive piglets on 21st day (N21), age of sows at first farrowing (AFF) and interval between two successive litters (IBTSL). Polymorphisms in AREG and LIF (C4950G) genes were detected by using PCR-RFLP methods, with restriction enzymes StyI and DraIII, respectively, in EGF gene by using PCR method, while C6988T in LIF gene by PCR-SSCP methods. The statistically significant differences were found at the locus EGF: sows with BB genotype showed higher number of piglets born alive (NBA) and higher number of alive piglets on 21st day (N21) (P<0.01 and P<0.05) when compared to the other genotypes. At the LIF1 locus sows of AA genotype had higher number of NBA (P<0.01) when compared to BB genotype, and at the LIF3 sows of BB had better results for this trait when compared to AA and AB genotype (P<0.01 and P<0.05). In our study, we obtained also statistically significant results for association between AREG gene and reproductive traits. In parities 2 to 4, statistically significant differences were observed between sows of A1A1 and A1A2 genotype of the AREG gene for NBA (P<0.05) and between AA and BB genotypes of the LIF1 gene for NBA and N21 (P<0.01 and P<0.05).",['Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The method uses a heterozygous plasmid containing one wild-type and one mutant sequence as a calibrator that is run at a single concentration, with each quantitative allele-specific PCR run. PCR data from both calibrator alleles, together with predetermined PCR efficiencies, are used to quantitate the mutant allele burden in unknown specimens. We demonstrate the utility of this method by using it to calculate BRAF V600E allele frequencies in cases of hairy-cell leukemia and show that it generates data that are comparable to those obtained via allele quantitation using conventional standard curves over a wide range of allelic ratios. This method is not subject to errors that may be introduced in traditional standard curves as the result of variations in pippetting or errors in the calculation of the absolute copy numbers of standards. Furthermore, it simplifies the workflow in the clinical laboratory and would provide significant advantages for efforts to standardize clinical quantitative PCR testing.","['Copyright (c) 2013 American Society for Investigative Pathology and the', 'Association for Molecular Pathology.

METHODS: Multicolor flow cytometry immunophenotypic analysis was performed on bone marrow aspirates of 135 patients with AML or MDS and peripheral blood samples in a subset of 33 patients. Immunohistochemistry was performed on bone marrow aspirate clot specimens of 84 patients. RESULTS: The median patient age was 63 years (range, 13-92 years); 102 (75%) patients had refractory or recurrent disease, and 68 (50%) had high-risk cytogenetics. Overall, the median percentage of blasts positive for CD30 was 14% (range, 0%-91%). By using an arbitrary 20% cutoff, 49 (36%) patients were considered to have CD30 expression. Monocytic cells, either mature or immature, were consistently negative for CD30. Therefore, CD30 expression was less in AML with monocytic differentiation (P = .006). The patients with persistent disease who had been actively treated had a higher level of CD30 expression than the patients who were untreated (P = .031). In paired samples, CD30 expression was consistently higher in bone marrow blasts than in peripheral blood blasts (P = .002). Immunohistochemistry demonstrated CD30 expression by myeloblasts in a subset of patients, but reactivity was generally weaker and focally compared. CONCLUSIONS: CD30 is expressed by myeloblasts in a substantial subset of patients with AML or MDS. Because the study group was composed mostly of patients with high-risk AML or MDS in whom very few treatment options are available, these data raise the possibility that anti-CD30-targeted therapy could be a potential option for this patient group.",['Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Inotuzumab ozogamicin (IO) is a CD22 monoclonal antibody attached to calicheamycin that targets B lymphocytes in early stages of development, successfully inducing remission in patients with multiply relapsed ALL. METHODS: We describe our findings in 26 patients who received allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (SCT) after treatment with IO between September 2010 and October 2011. RESULTS: Patients with a median age of 33 years (range, 5-70 years) received an allogeneic matched sibling donor (n = 9), matched- or 1-antigen mismatched unrelated donor (n = 16), or cord blood donor SCT (n = 1) while in complete remission (n = 23) or with active disease (n = 3). At the time of SCT, 15 patients were in complete remission without evidence of minimal residual disease (MRD) measured by multiparameter flow cytometry. Patients were heavily pretreated, including 5 patients who had received previous allogeneic SCT. Patients received a median of 3 courses of IO (range, 1-5 courses) before SCT. Seven patients are alive at a median follow-up of 13 months (range, 5-16 months), with 1-year event-free and overall survival (OS) of 22% and 20%, respectively. Patients without MRD at time of SCT had a markedly better 1-year OS of 42%. The cumulative incidence of nonrelapse mortality (NRM) at 6 months and 1 year were 40% and 60%, respectively, with 5 deaths attributed to venoocclusive disease (VOD). CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with IO allows more patients to undergo transplantation while in remission, with favorable overall survival in patients without MRD who undergo transplantation.

Classifying subtypes accurately using genomic data will provide individualized treatments to target-specific disease subtypes. However, it is often difficult to obtain satisfactory classification accuracy using only one type of data, because the subtypes of a disease can exhibit similar patterns in one data type. Fortunately, multiple types of genomic data are often available due to the rapid development of genomic techniques. This raises the question on whether the classification performance can significantly be improved by combining multiple types of genomic data. In this article, we classified four subtypes of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) with multiple types of genome-wide data (e.g., mRNA and miRNA expression) from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project. We proposed a multi-class compressed sensing-based detector (MCSD) for this study. The MCSD was trained with data from TCGA and then applied to subtype GBM patients using an independent testing data. We performed the classification on the same patient subjects with three data types, i.e., miRNA expression data, mRNA (or gene expression) data, and their combinations. The classification accuracy is 69.1% with the miRNA expression data, 52.7% with mRNA expression data, and 90.9% with the combination of both mRNA and miRNA expression data. In addition, some biomarkers identified by the integrated approaches have been confirmed with results from the published literatures. These results indicate that the combined analysis can significantly improve the accuracy of classifying GBM subtypes and identify potential biomarkers for disease diagnosis.",,"['Tang, Wenlong', 'Duan, Junbo', 'Zhang, Ji-Gang', 'Wang, Yu-Ping']","['Tang W', 'Duan J', 'Zhang JG', 'Wang YP']","['Department of Biomedical Engineering, Tulane University, New Orleans, LA, USA. wyp@tulane.edu.']",['eng'],['R01 GM109068/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],['Journal Article'],20130114,Germany,EURASIP J Bioinform Syst Biol,EURASIP journal on bioinformatics & systems biology,101263720,,,,,PMC3651309,,2013/01/15 06:00,2013/01/15 06:01,['2013/01/15 06:00'],"['2011/12/28 00:00 [received]', '2012/12/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/01/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/15 06:01 [medline]']","['1687-4153-2013-2 [pii]', '10.1186/1687-4153-2013-2 [doi]']",epublish,EURASIP J Bioinform Syst Biol. 2013 Jan 14;2013(1):2. doi: 10.1186/1687-4153-2013-2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unfortunately, clinical immunotherapeutic use of WT1 peptides against AML has been inconclusive. With the rationale of stimulating multiantigenic responses against WT1, we genetically programmed long-lasting dendritic cells capable of producing and processing endogenous WT1 epitopes. A tricistronic lentiviral vector co-expressing a truncated form of WT1 (lacking the DNA-binding domain), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and interleukin-4 (IL-4) was used to transduce human monocytes ex vivo. Overnight transduction induced self-differentiation of monocytes into immunophenotypically stable ""SmartDC/tWT1"" (GM-CSF(+), IL-4(+), tWT1(+), IL-6(+), IL-8(+), TNF-alpha(+), MCP-1(+), HLA-DR(+), CD86(+), CCR2(+), CCR5(+)) that were viable for 3 weeks in vitro. SmartDC/tWT1 were produced with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) obtained from an FLT3-ITD(+) AML patient and surplus material from a donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) and used to expand CD8(+) T cells in vitro. Expanded cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) showed antigen-specific reactivity against WT1 and against WT1(+) leukemia cells. SmartDC/tWT1 injected s.c. into Nod.Rag1(-/-).IL2rgammac(-/-) mice were viable in vivo for more than three weeks. Migration of human T cells (huCTLs) to the immunization site was demonstrated following adoptive transfer of huCTLs into mice immunized with SmartDC/tWT1. Furthermore, SmartDC/tWT1 immunization plus adoptive transfer of T cells reactive against WT1 into mice resulted in growth arrest of a WT1(+) tumor. Gene array analyses of SmartDC/tWT1 demonstrated upregulation of several genes related to innate immunity. Thus, SmartDC/tWT1 can be produced in a single day of ex vivo gene transfer, are highly viable in vivo, and have great potential for use as immunotherapy against malignant transformation overexpressing WT1.",,"['Sundarasetty, Bala Sai', 'Singh, Vijay Kumar', 'Salguero, Gustavo', 'Geffers, Robert', 'Rickmann, Mareike', 'Macke, Laura', 'Borchers, Sylvia', 'Figueiredo, Constanca', 'Schambach, Axel', 'Gullberg, Urban', 'Provasi, Elena', 'Bonini, Chiara', 'Ganser, Arnold', 'Woelfel, Thomas', 'Stripecke, Renata']","['Sundarasetty BS', 'Singh VK', 'Salguero G', 'Geffers R', 'Rickmann M', 'Macke L', 'Borchers S', 'Figueiredo C', 'Schambach A', 'Gullberg U', 'Provasi E', 'Bonini C', 'Ganser A', 'Woelfel T', 'Stripecke R']","['Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, 30625 Hannover, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Hum Gene Ther,Human gene therapy,9008950,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,,"['Adoptive Transfer/*methods', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/immunology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Survival', 'Dendritic Cells/*immunology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/immunology', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', '*Genes, Wilms Tumor', 'Genetic Therapy', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-4/genetics/metabolism', 'Lentivirus/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology/*therapy', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mice', 'Monocytes', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Risk Factors']",PMC3696945,,2013/01/15 06:00,2013/09/11 06:00,['2013/01/15 06:00'],"['2013/01/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/hum.2012.128 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Gene Ther. 2013 Feb;24(2):220-37. doi: 10.1089/hum.2012.128.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Disruption of the CDKN2A tumor suppressor locus occurs in most cases of T-ALL and is thought to contribute to leukemic transformation. To determine whether loss of function of CDKN2A cooperates with HMGA1 in T-ALL, we crossed HMGA1a transgenics onto a Cdkn2a null background. We discovered that T-ALL is markedly accelerated in HMGA1a transgenic Cdkn2a null mice. In addition, these mice recapitulate salient clinical and pathologic features of human T-ALL.

METHODS: The sample size of this randomized, multicenter, phase III study, was calculated assuming that a single dose of pegfilgrastim of 100 ug/kg was not inferior to 9 doses of filgrastim of 5 ug/kg/day. Randomization was performed by a computer-generated list and stored by sequentially numbered sealed envelopes. RESULTS: Sixty-one patients, with a median age of 11.5 years, were recruited: 29 in the filgrastim arm and 32 in the pegfilgrastim arm. Twenty percent were affected by lymphoma/leukaemia and eighty percent by solid tumors. The mean time to PMN engraftment was 10.48 days (standard deviation [SD] 1.57) and 10.44 days (SD 2.44) in the filgrastim and pegfilgrastim arms, respectively. Having fixed a non-inferiority margin Delta of 3, the primary endpoint of non-inferiority was reached. No differences were observed for other secondary endpoints: platelet engraftment, mean time to platelet recovery (28 days vs. 33 days), fever of unknown origin (79% vs. 78%), proven infection (34% vs. 28%), mucositis (76% vs. 59%). After a median follow-up of 2.3 years (95% C.I.: 1.5, 3.3), 20 deaths were observed due to disease progression.

A requirement for WNT/beta-catenin signaling in the pathogenesis of AML has recently been suggested by a mouse model. However, its relationship to a specific molecular function promoting retention of self-renewing leukemia-initiating cells (LICs) in human remains elusive. To identify transcriptional programs involved in the maintenance of a self-renewing state in LICs, we performed the expression profiling in normal (n = 10) and leukemic (n = 33) human long-term reconstituting AC133(+) cells, which represent an expanded cell population in most AML patients. This study reveals the ligand-dependent WNT pathway activation in AC133(bright) AML cells and shows a diffuse expression and release of WNT10B, a hematopoietic stem cell regenerative-associated molecule. The establishment of a primary AC133(+) AML cell culture (A46) demonstrated that leukemia cells synthesize and secrete WNT ligands, increasing the levels of dephosphorylated beta-catenin in vivo. We tested the LSC functional activity in AC133(+) cells and found significant levels of engraftment upon transplantation of A46 cells into irradiated Rag2(-/-)gammac(-/-) mice. Owing to the link between hematopoietic regeneration and developmental signaling, we transplanted A46 cells into developing zebrafish. This system revealed the formation of ectopic structures by activating dorsal organizer markers that act downstream of the WNT pathway. In conclusion, our findings suggest that AC133(bright) LSCs are promoted by misappropriating homeostatic WNT programs that control hematopoietic regeneration.",,"['Beghini, Alessandro', 'Corlazzoli, Francesca', 'Del Giacco, Luca', 'Re, Matteo', 'Lazzaroni, Francesca', 'Brioschi, Matteo', 'Valentini, Giorgio', 'Ferrazzi, Fulvia', 'Ghilardi, Anna', 'Righi, Marco', 'Turrini, Mauro', 'Mignardi, Marco', 'Cesana, Clara', 'Bronte, Vincenzo', 'Nilsson, Mats', 'Morra, Enrica', 'Cairoli, Roberto']","['Beghini A', 'Corlazzoli F', 'Del Giacco L', 'Re M', 'Lazzaroni F', 'Brioschi M', 'Valentini G', 'Ferrazzi F', 'Ghilardi A', 'Righi M', 'Turrini M', 'Mignardi M', 'Cesana C', 'Bronte V', 'Nilsson M', 'Morra E', 'Cairoli R']","['Department of Medical Biotechnology and Translational Medicine, Universita degli Studi di Milano, Milano, Italy. alessandro.beghini@unimi.it']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Neoplasia,"Neoplasia (New York, N.Y.)",100886622,"['0 (AC133 Antigen)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (PROM1 protein, human)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Prom1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (WNT10B protein, human)', '0 (Wnt Proteins)', '0 (beta Catenin)']",IM,,"['AC133 Antigen', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Glycoproteins/metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/metabolism', 'Peptides/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Primary Cell Culture', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Regeneration/*genetics', 'Wnt Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Wnt Signaling Pathway/*genetics', 'Zebrafish', 'beta Catenin/*metabolism']",PMC3540948,,2013/01/12 06:00,2013/07/11 06:00,['2013/01/12 06:00'],"['2012/09/07 00:00 [received]', '2012/10/15 00:00 [revised]', '2012/10/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/01/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/01/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1593/neo.121480 [doi]'],ppublish,Neoplasia. 2012 Dec;14(12):1236-48. doi: 10.1593/neo.121480.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, in the absence of LIF, Wnt signaling is unable to maintain ESCs in the undifferentiated state. To investigate the role of canonical Wnt signaling in pluripotency and lineage specification, we expressed Wnt3a in mESCs and characterized them in growth and differentiation. We found that activated canonical Wnt signaling induced the formation of a reversible metastable primitive endoderm state in mESC. Upon subsequent differentiation, Wnt3a-stimulated mESCs gave rise to large quantities of visceral endoderm. Furthermore, we determined that the ability of canonical Wnt signaling to induce a metastable primitive endoderm state was mediated by Tbx3.

In contrast, the supplementation of fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) in culture promotes mouse ESC differentiation. It has been proposed that factors that are adverse for maintaining the self-renewal of ESCs might play detrimental roles in the transcription factor-mediated reprogramming of somatic cells to pluripotency. However, recent evidence has revealed that reprogramming efficiency could be improved by FGF2, while the underlying molecular mechanism remains unknown. In this study, we dissected the roles of FGF2 in promoting mouse fibroblast reprogramming and disclosed the molecular mechanism behind this process. We used both primary induction and secondary inducible reprogramming systems and demonstrated that supplementation with FGF2 in the early phase of induced pluripotent stem cell induction could significantly increase reprogramming efficiency. Moreover, we discovered that many extracellular matrix candidate genes were significantly downregulated in fibroblasts treated with FGF2, and in particular, the synthesis of collagen could be greatly reduced by FGF2 treatment. Subsequently, we demonstrated that collagen is a barrier for reprogramming fibroblast cells to pluripotency, and the decreasing of collagen either by collagenase treatment or downregulation of collagen gene expression could significantly improve the reprogramming efficiency.

Oral posaconazole absorption is highly variable. We describe the pharmacokinetics of oral posaconazole in a 2-year-old boy with rhino-cerebral-orbital zygomycosis. Seven days after induction therapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia, he was brought to the emergency department because of left eyelid swelling and was admitted to the hospital. Zygomycosis was diagnosed 12 days later. After we conducted a literature search and consulted with antifungal drug experts, a triple-antifungal regimen consisting of liposomal amphotericin B, caspofungin, and posaconazole was started. Given the severity of the disease, we aimed for posaconazole plasma trough concentrations greater than 1.25 microg/ml; the dosage necessary to achieve this goal was posaconazole 200 mg 4 times/day. After a difficult 105-day stay in the hospital and stabilization of the fungal infection, the patient was discharged. Caspofungin was discontinued at time of discharge, but the patient continued to receive amphotericin B lipid complex 7.5 mg/kg/day intravenously and posaconazole 200 mg orally 4 times/day. This is one of the few case reports describing posaconazole pharmacokinetics in a child younger than 8 years.

Evolution of myelofibrosis can lead to life-threatening complications, including transformation to leukemia, thrombotic events, and hemorrhagic episodes. The only curative therapy for myelofibrosis is allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Because this disease manifests primarily in the older population, many patients diagnosed with myelofibrosis are not considered medically fit for such aggressive therapy. Other available medical therapies do not halt disease progression; instead, current treatment strategies have focused on targeting specific symptomology, although with limited efficacy. The lack of effective treatment options for patients with myelofibrosis has rendered this orphan disease state an unmet medical need, and novel approaches to improve outcomes are necessary. Emerging research has identified numerous molecular mutations in patients with myelofibrosis, making this disease a potential candidate for molecularly targeted therapy. The most prevalent mutation identified is a gain-of-function mutation in the Janus kinase (JAK) family, JAK2 V617F, which has been identified in more than half of patients with myelofibrosis. This mutation results in a constitutively active JAK-signal transducer and activator of transcription pathway resulting in dysregulated cellular proliferation and hematopoiesis. Ruxolitinib is a small-molecule inhibitor of JAK1 and JAK2 and recently became the first drug approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of symptomatic intermediate- or high-risk myelofibrosis. In clinical trials, ruxolitinib demonstrated promising efficacy in reducing splenomegaly and myelofibrosis-related symptoms. However, ruxolitinib did not demonstrate disease-modifying potential and is not considered a curative therapeutic option. Adverse events associated with ruxolitinib are primarily hematologic, with thrombocytopenia and anemia being the most common toxicologic events identified. Future research will shed light on whether ruxolitinib in combination with other treatments will further enhance outcomes in myelofibrosis.","['(c) 2013 Pharmacotherapy Publications, Inc.']","['Ganetsky, Alex']",['Ganetsky A'],"['Pharmacy Department, Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, USA. alex.ganetsky@gmail.com']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Pharmacotherapy,Pharmacotherapy,8111305,"['0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '82S8X8XX8H (ruxolitinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinases)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Clinical Trials as Topic/trends', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy/methods/trends', 'Nitriles', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/*drug therapy/*enzymology/genetics', 'Pyrazoles/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2013/01/12 06:00,2013/10/18 06:00,['2013/01/12 06:00'],"['2013/01/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/01/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/phar.1165 [doi]'],ppublish,Pharmacotherapy. 2013 Jan;33(1):84-92. doi: 10.1002/phar.1165.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These results were further supported by a recent meta-analysis of our GWAS with two other GWAS of CLL, supporting the IRF8 gene as a strong candidate for CLL risk. METHODS: To refine the genetic association of CLL risk, we conducted Sanger sequencing of IRF8 in 94 CLL cases and 96 controls. We then conducted fine mapping by genotyping 39 variants (of which 10 were identified from sequencing) in 745 CLL cases and 1,521 controls. We also assessed these associations with risk of other non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) subtypes. RESULTS: The strongest association with CLL risk was observed with a common single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located within the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of IRF8 (rs1044873, log additive OR = 0.7, P = 1.81 x 10(-6)). This SNP was not associated with the other NHL subtypes (all P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: We provide evidence that rs1044873 in the IRF8 gene accounts for the initial GWAS signal for CLL risk. This association appears to be unique to CLL with little support for association with other common NHL subtypes. Future work is needed to assess functional role of IRF8 in CLL etiology. IMPACT: These data provide support that a functional variant within the 3'UTR of IRF8 may be driving the GWAS signal seen on 16q24.1 for CLL risk.",,"['Slager, Susan L', 'Achenbach, Sara J', 'Asmann, Yan W', 'Camp, Nicola J', 'Rabe, Kari G', 'Goldin, Lynn R', 'Call, Timothy G', 'Shanafelt, Tait D', 'Kay, Neil E', 'Cunningham, Julie M', 'Wang, Alice H', 'Weinberg, J Brice', 'Norman, Aaron D', 'Link, Brian K', 'Leis, Jose F', 'Vachon, Celine M', 'Lanasa, Mark C', 'Caporaso, Neil E', 'Novak, Anne J', 'Cerhan, James R']","['Slager SL', 'Achenbach SJ', 'Asmann YW', 'Camp NJ', 'Rabe KG', 'Goldin LR', 'Call TG', 'Shanafelt TD', 'Kay NE', 'Cunningham JM', 'Wang AH', 'Weinberg JB', 'Norman AD', 'Link BK', 'Leis JF', 'Vachon CM', 'Lanasa MC', 'Caporaso NE', 'Novak AJ', 'Cerhan JR']","['Mayo Clinic, 200 First Street SW, Rochester, MN 55905, USA. slager@mayo.edu']",['eng'],"['CA118444/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA97274/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA148690/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA148690/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA92153/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K08 CA134919/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA097274/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 CA118444/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA015083/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA092153/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'NIH CA134919/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA095241/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01 CA015083/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20130110,United States,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev,"Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology",9200608,"[""0 (3' Untranslated Regions)"", '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Interferon Regulatory Factors)', '0 (interferon regulatory factor-8)']",IM,,"[""3' Untranslated Regions/*genetics"", 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Genome-Wide Association Study', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Interferon Regulatory Factors/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*etiology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/classification/*etiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Factors', 'Young Adult']",PMC3596428,['NIHMS434953'],2013/01/12 06:00,2013/09/13 06:00,['2013/01/12 06:00'],"['2013/01/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/01/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/13 06:00 [medline]']","['1055-9965.EPI-12-1217 [pii]', '10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-12-1217 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev. 2013 Mar;22(3):461-6. doi: 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-12-1217.

Some coactivators promote transcription by connecting transcription factors to the basal transcriptional machinery. The highly conserved coactivators CREB-binding protein (CBP) and its paralog, E1A-binding protein (p300), each have four separate transactivation domains (TADs) that interact with the TADs of a number of DNA-binding transcription activators as well as general transcription factors (GTFs), thus mediating recruitment of basal transcription machinery to the promoter. Most promoters comprise multiple activator-binding sites, and many activators contain tandem TADs, thus multivalent interactions may stabilize CBP/p300 at the promoter, and intrinsically disordered regions in CBP/p300 and many activators may confer adaptability to these multivalent complexes. CBP/p300 contains a catalytic histone acetyltransferase (HAT) domain, which remodels chromatin to 'relax' its superstructure and enables transcription of proximal genes. The HAT activity of CBP/p300 also acetylates some transcription factors (e.g., p53), hence modulating the function of key transcriptional regulators. Through these numerous interactions, CBP/p300 has been implicated in complex physiological and pathological processes, and, in response to different signals, can drive cells towards proliferation or apoptosis. Dysregulation of the transcriptional and epigenetic functions of CBP/p300 is associated with leukemia and other types of cancer, thus it has been recognized as a potential anti-cancer drug target.

However, the specific features of these cases have not been well described. We studied 38 patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia who progressed to acute myeloid leukemia. We compared the clinicopathologic and genetic features of these cases with 180 patients with de novo acute myeloid leukemia and 34 patients with acute myeloid leukemia following myelodysplastic syndromes. We also examined features associated with progression from chronic myelomonocytic leukemia to acute myeloid leukemia by comparing the progressed chronic myelomonocytic leukemia cases with a cohort of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia cases that did not transform to acute myeloid leukemia. Higher white blood cell count, marrow cellularity, karyotype risk score, and Revised International Prognostic Scoring System score were associated with more rapid progression from chronic myelomonocytic leukemia to acute myeloid leukemia. Patients with acute myeloid leukemia ex chronic myelomonocytic leukemia were older (P<0.01) and less likely to receive aggressive treatment (P=0.02) than de novo acute myeloid leukemia patients. Most cases showed monocytic differentiation and fell into the intermediate acute myeloid leukemia karyotype risk group; 55% had normal karyotype and 17% had NPM1 mutation. Median overall survival was 6 months, which was inferior to de novo acute myeloid leukemia (17 months, P=0.002) but similar to post myelodysplastic syndrome acute myeloid leukemia. On multivariate analysis of all acute myeloid leukemia patients, only age and karyotype were independent prognostic variables for overall survival. Our findings indicate that acute myeloid leukemia following chronic myelomonocytic leukemia displays aggressive behavior and support placement of these cases within the category of acute myeloid leukemia with myelodysplasia-related changes. The poor prognosis of these patients may be related to an older population and lack of favorable-prognosis karyotypes that characterize many de novo acute myeloid leukemia cases.",,"['Courville, Elizabeth L', 'Wu, Yue', 'Kourda, Jihen', 'Roth, Christine G', 'Brockmann, Jillian', 'Muzikansky, Alona', 'Fathi, Amir T', 'de Leval, Laurence', 'Orazi, Attilio', 'Hasserjian, Robert P']","['Courville EL', 'Wu Y', 'Kourda J', 'Roth CG', 'Brockmann J', 'Muzikansky A', 'Fathi AT', 'de Leval L', 'Orazi A', 'Hasserjian RP']","['Department of Pathology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA 02114, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20130111,United States,Mod Pathol,"Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc",8806605,"['0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Bone Marrow Examination', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Chi-Square Distribution', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/mortality/*pathology/therapy', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/genetics/mortality/*pathology/therapy', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Monocytes/pathology', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Mutation', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/pathology', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Switzerland', 'United States', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics']",,,2013/01/12 06:00,2014/01/15 06:00,['2013/01/12 06:00'],"['2013/01/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/01/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/15 06:00 [medline]']","['modpathol2012218 [pii]', '10.1038/modpathol.2012.218 [doi]']",ppublish,Mod Pathol. 2013 Jun;26(6):751-61. doi: 10.1038/modpathol.2012.218.

We first identified Np9 as a potent viral oncogene in human leukemia. Silencing of Np9 inhibited the growth of myeloid and lymphoblastic leukemic cells, whereas expression of Np9 significantly promoted the growth of leukemia cells in vitro and in vivo. Np9 not only activated ERK, AKT and Notch1 pathways but also upregulated beta-catenin essential for survival of leukemia stem cells. In human leukemia, Np9 protein level in leukemia patients was substantially higher than that in normal donors (56% vs 4.5%). Moreover, Np9 protein level was correlated with the number of leukemia stem/progenitor cells but not detected in normal CD34(+) hematopoietic stem cells. In addition, Np9-positive samples highly expressed leukemia-specific pol-env polyprotein, env and transmembrane proteins as well as viral particles.

Medi-551/CD19 complexes internalize slowly (>5 h) and thus remain accessible to effector cells for prolonged periods. We evaluated in vitro ADCC and ADCP activities of primary human natural killer (NK) cells and macrophages against precursor-B (pre-B) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cell lines and pediatric patient blasts. Fluorescent imaging studies document immunological synapses formed between anti-CD19-bound target leukemia cells and effector cells and capture the kinetics of both NK-mediated killing and macrophage phagocytosis. Genetic polymorphisms in FcgammaRIIIA-158F/V modulate in vitro activities of effector cells, with FcgammaRIIIA-158V homozygotes or heterozygotes showing the strongest activity. Medi-551 treatment of severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice engrafted with human pre-B cells led to prolonged animal survival and markedly reduced disease burden in blood, liver and bone marrow.

METHODS: Final height, GH/IGF-1 axis, and body mass index were analyzed after 13.7 (7.0-20.7) years from diagnosis in 34 boys aged <12 years at diagnosis and 41 girls <10 years at diagnosis. A modified German BFM-83 ALL protocol included (n = 42) or did not include (n = 33) prophylactic cranial irradiation. In 27 patients, GH after insulin tolerance test, IGF-1, cortisol, free T(4) and estradiol/testosterone were determined. RESULTS: Final height was significantly reduced (mean Z-score for height between final height and diagnosis, DeltaHAZ = -0.61, p = 0.0001). At that point, 3 patients were obese (4%) and 17 were overweight (22.7%). Patients aged </= 4 years at diagnosis and those irradiated had a greater loss in final height (p = 0.001 and p = 0.008, respectively). Abnormalities in GH/IGF-1 axis were observed in 4 patients: 3 had a GH peak <6 ng/ml and 1 had a serum IGF-1 concentration <25 ng/ml. Growth deficit was significantly higher in patients with hormonal deficiency (p = 0.006). CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of ALL during childhood is associated with final height deficit. Young age at diagnosis and radiotherapy were the major risk factors. GH/IGF-1 deficiency was found particularly in irradiated patients, even though it was detected in 1 non-irradiated patient.","['Copyright (c) 2013 S.

These PML-NBs recruit numerous proteins including CBP, p53 and HIPK2 in response to DNA damage, senescence and apoptosis. In this study, we investigated the effect of presenilin (PS), the main component of the gamma-secretase complex, in PML/p53 expression and downstream consequences during DNA damage-induced cell death using camptothecin (CPT). We found that the loss of PS in PS knockout (KO) MEFs (mouse embryonic fibroblasts) results in severely blunted PML expression and attenuated cell death upon CPT exposure, a phenotype that is fully reversed by re-expression of PS1 in PS KO cells and recapitulated by gamma-secretase inhibitors in hPS1 MEFs. Interestingly, the gamma-secretase cleavage product, APP intracellular domain (AICD), together with Fe65-induced PML expression at the protein and transcriptional levels in PS KO cells.

Numerous studies with genetically modified animals have demonstrated that Nrf2 is a sensitivity determining factor upon the exposure to environmental chemicals including carcinogens. Moreover, recent studies have demonstrated that polymorphism in the human NRF2 promoter is associated with higher risks for developing acute lung injury, gastric mucosal inflammation, and nephritis. Therefore, the identification of reliable and effective human target genes of NRF2 may allow the monitoring of NRF2 activity and to predict individual sensitivity to environmental stress-induced damage. For this purpose, we investigated genes that are tightly controlled by NRF2 to establish markers for NRF2 activity in human cells. Firstly, in the normal human renal epithelial HK-2 cells, the measurement of the expression of 30 previously reported NRF2 target genes in response to NRF2 inducers (sulforaphane, tert-butylhydroquinone, cinnamic aldehyde, and hydrogen peroxide) showed that the aldo-keto reductase (AKR) 1C1 is highly inducible by all treatments. Accordantly, the basal and inducible expressions of AKRs were significantly attenuated in NRF2-silenced HK-2 cells. Whereas, cells with stable KEAP1 knockdown, which causes a modest NRF2 activation, demonstrated substantially increased levels of AKR1A1, 1B1, 1B10, 1C1, 1C2, and 1C3. Secondly, the linkage between NRF2 and the AKRs was confirmed in human monocytic leukemia cell line U937, which can be a model of peripherally available blood cells. The treatment of U937 cells with NRF2 inducers including sulforaphane effectively elevated the expression of AKR1B1, 1B10, 1C1, 1C2, and 1C3. Whereas, the levels of both the basal and sulforaphane-inducible expression of AKR1C1 were significantly reduced in NRF2-silenced stable U937 cells compared to the control cells. Similarly, the inducible expression of AKR1C1 was observed in another human monocytic leukemia cell line THP-1 as well as in human primary blood CD14(+) monocytes. In conclusion, together with the high inducibility and NRF2 dependency shown in renal epithelial cells as well as in peripherally available blood cells, current findings suggest that AKRs can be utilized as a marker of NRF2 activity in human cells.",['Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: This study was a retrospective cohort analysis of a population data set that captures diagnostic and procedure data on all hospitalizations from more than 300 hospitals within the Australian state of Victoria from 1998 to 2008. RESULTS: There were 3149 incident cases of MDS. The age-standardized incidence rate was higher than reported from local cancer registries (for 2007 9.6 per 100,000 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 9.2-10.0] vs. 4.8). Median age was 79 years, 56.3% were males, and 34.6% were TD-MDS. Overall number of hospitalizations with transfusion increased over the study period, but not median transfusion episodes per patient.

While the association of XMRV with CFS and PC has recently been discredited, no studies have been performed in Australian patients to investigate the association between PC and XMRV or related murine leukemia virus (MLV) in matched PC and normal tissue. METHODS: Genomic DNA (gDNA) was purified from matched normal and cancer formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) prostate tissue from 35 Australian PC patients with Gleason scores ranging from 7 - 10. The presence of the ribonuclease L (RNase L) polymorphism R462Q was determined by allele specific PCR. Samples were screened for XMRV and related murine leukemia virus (MLV) variants by qPCR. Contaminating mouse DNA was detected using qPCR targeting mouse intracisternal A particle long terminal repeat DNA. RESULTS: gDNA was successfully purified from 94% (66/70) of normal and cancer FFPE prostate tissues. RNase L typing revealed 8% were homozygous (QQ), 60% were heterozygous (RQ) and 32% were wild-type (RR) for the RNase L mutation. None of the 66 samples tested were positive for XMRV or related MLV sequences using broad MLV or XMRV specific primers with detection sensitivities of 1 viral copy of MLV/XMRV and XMRV DNA, respectively.

We have previously shown that heparin-binding epidermal-like growth factor (HB-EGF) is necessary for IEC restitution; however, the mechanisms by which HB-EGF promotes restitution remain poorly understood. This study was designed to investigate whether HB-EGF promotes intestinal restitution by affecting integrin-extracellular matrix (ECM) interactions and intercellular adhesions. The effect of HB-EGF administration was examined in a murine necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) model in vivo and an IEC line scrape-wound healing model in vitro. We evaluated the effect of HB-EGF on the expression of integrins, E-cadherin/beta-catenin, and integrin alpha5beta1-dependent cell-ECM interactions.

In addition, HB-EGF decreased the expression E-cadherin/beta-catenin, via the activation of v-erb-b2 erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog (ErbB-1).

While the majority of these individuals remain asymptomatic, 0.3-4% develop a neurodegenerative inflammatory disease, termed HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP). HAM/TSP results in the progressive demyelination of the central nervous system and is a differential diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS). The etiology of HAM/TSP is unclear, but evidence points to a role for CNS-inflitrating T-cells in pathogenesis. Recently, the HTLV-1-Tax protein has been shown to induce transcription of the human endogenous retrovirus (HERV) families W, H and K. Intriguingly, numerous studies have implicated these same HERV families in MS, though this association remains controversial. RESULTS: Here, we explore the hypothesis that HTLV-1-infection results in the induction of HERV antigen expression and the elicitation of HERV-specific T-cells responses which, in turn, may be reactive against neurons and other tissues. PBMC from 15 HTLV-1-infected subjects, 5 of whom presented with HAM/TSP, were comprehensively screened for T-cell responses to overlapping peptides spanning HERV-K(HML-2) Gag and Env. In addition, we screened for responses to peptides derived from diverse HERV families, selected based on predicted binding to predicted optimal epitopes. We observed a lack of responses to each of these peptide sets. CONCLUSIONS: Thus, although the limited scope of our screening prevents us from conclusively disproving our hypothesis, the current study does not provide data supporting a role for HERV-specific T-cell responses in HTLV-1 associated immunopathology.",,"['Jones, R Brad', 'Leal, Fabio E', 'Hasenkrug, Aaron M', 'Segurado, Aluisio C', 'Nixon, Douglas F', 'Ostrowski, Mario A', 'Kallas, Esper G']","['Jones RB', 'Leal FE', 'Hasenkrug AM', 'Segurado AC', 'Nixon DF', 'Ostrowski MA', 'Kallas EG']","[""Department of Immunology, University of Toronto, 1 King's College Circle, Rm 6352, Toronto, ON M5S 1A8, Canada. brad.jones@utoronto.ca""]",['eng'],"['AI076059/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI084113/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'D43 TW00003/TW/FIC NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130110,England,J Negat Results Biomed,Journal of negative results in biomedicine,101152210,"['0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Endogenous Retroviruses/*immunology', 'Female', 'Gene Products, env/*immunology', 'Gene Products, gag/*immunology', 'HTLV-I Infections/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Young Adult']",PMC3560086,,2013/01/12 06:00,2013/07/06 06:00,['2013/01/12 06:00'],"['2012/04/20 00:00 [received]', '2012/12/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/01/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/01/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/06 06:00 [medline]']","['1477-5751-12-3 [pii]', '10.1186/1477-5751-12-3 [doi]']",epublish,J Negat Results Biomed. 2013 Jan 10;12:3. doi: 10.1186/1477-5751-12-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, retroviruses are widely used as tools to transfer genes of interest to target cells. Understanding the entry mechanism of retroviruses contributes to developments of novel therapeutic approaches against retrovirus-induced diseases and efficient exploitation of retroviral vectors. Entry of enveloped viruses into host cell cytoplasm is achieved by fusion between the viral envelope and host cell membranes at either the cell surface or intracellular vesicles. Many animal retroviruses enter host cells through endosomes and require endosome acidification. Ecotropic murine leukemia virus entry requires cathepsin proteases activated by the endosome acidification. CD4-dependent human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is thought to occur via endosomes, but endosome acidification is not necessary for the entry whereas entry of CD4-independent HIVs, which are thought to be prototypes of CD4-dependent viruses, is low pH dependent. There are several controversial results on the retroviral entry pathways. Because endocytosis and endosome acidification are complicatedly controlled by cellular mechanisms, the retrovirus entry pathways may be different in different cell lines.",,"['Kubo, Yoshinao', 'Hayashi, Hideki', 'Matsuyama, Toshifumi', 'Sato, Hironori', 'Yamamoto, Naoki']","['Kubo Y', 'Hayashi H', 'Matsuyama T', 'Sato H', 'Yamamoto N']","['Department of AIDS Research, Institute of Tropical Medicine, Nagasaki University, Nagasaki 852-8523, Japan ; Division of Cytokine Signaling, Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki University, Nagasaki 852-8523, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20121206,United States,Adv Virol,Advances in virology,101508613,,,,,PMC3523128,,2013/01/11 06:00,2013/01/11 06:01,['2013/01/11 06:00'],"['2012/08/09 00:00 [received]', '2012/10/14 00:00 [revised]', '2012/11/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/01/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/01/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/11 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2012/640894 [doi]'],ppublish,Adv Virol. 2012;2012:640894. doi: 10.1155/2012/640894.

Although the clinical benefits of these drugs are impressive, their effects are generally short-lived due to the acquisition of resistance. Unlike most cytotoxic agents, for which resistance mechanisms have remained obscure despite decades of clinical use, an understanding of the molecular basis of resistance to most targeted agents has emerged quickly. This rapid progress has been possible due to advances in molecular technologies that allow genome-wide profiling of patient samples. One important and consistent theme is that resistance is almost invariably associated with restoration of the signaling pathway inhibited by the targeted agent.

In the process of infection, EBV faces challenges: the host cell environment is harsh, and the survival and apoptosis of host cells are precisely regulated. Only when host cells receive sufficient survival signals may they immortalize. To establish efficiently a lytic or long-term latent infection, EBV must escape the host cell immunologic mechanism and resist host cell apoptosis by interfering with multiple signaling pathways. This review details the apoptotic pathway disrupted by EBV in EBV-infected cells and describes the interactions of EBV gene products with host cellular factors as well as the function of these factors, which decide the fate of the host cell. The relationships between other EBV-encoded genes and proteins of the B-cell leukemia/lymphoma (Bcl) family are unknown. Still, EBV seems to contribute to establishing its own latency and the formation of tumors by modifying events that impact cell survival and proliferation as well as the immune response of the infected host.

Approaches to discovering and adjusting for selection bias have been proposed in the literature using graphical and heuristic tools as well as more complex statistical methods. The approach we propose is based on a survey-weighting method termed Bayesian post-stratification and follows from the conditional independences that characterise selection bias. We use our approach to perform a selection bias sensitivity analysis by using ancillary data sources that describe the target case-control population to re-weight the odds ratio estimates obtained from the study. The method is applied to two case-control studies, the first investigating the association between exposure to electromagnetic fields and acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in children and the second investigating the association between maternal occupational exposure to hairspray and a congenital anomaly in male babies called hypospadias. In both case-control studies, our method showed that the odds ratios were only moderately sensitive to selection bias.","['Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']","['Geneletti, S', 'Best, N', 'Toledano, M B', 'Elliott, P', 'Richardson, S']","['Geneletti S', 'Best N', 'Toledano MB', 'Elliott P', 'Richardson S']","['Department of Statistics, London School of Economics and Political Science, Houghton Street, London, WC2A 2AE, UK.']",['eng'],"['G0801056/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'DH_/Department of Health/United Kingdom']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130110,England,Stat Med,Statistics in medicine,8215016,['0 (Hair Preparations)'],IM,,"['Adult', '*Bayes Theorem', 'Biostatistics/*methods', '*Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Electromagnetic Fields/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Hair Preparations/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Hypospadias/etiology', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Maternal Exposure/adverse effects', 'Occupational Exposure/adverse effects', 'Odds Ratio', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/etiology', 'Pregnancy', '*Selection Bias']",,,2013/01/11 06:00,2014/01/22 06:00,['2013/01/11 06:00'],"['2011/08/02 00:00 [received]', '2012/12/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/01/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/01/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/sim.5722 [doi]'],ppublish,Stat Med. 2013 Jul 10;32(15):2555-70. doi: 10.1002/sim.5722.

This level of mechanistic understanding requires integration of genomic information with complementary functional analyses to identify oncogenic targets and relies on the development of computational frameworks to aid in the prioritization and visualization of these diverse data types. In response to this, we have developed HitWalker, which prioritizes patient variants relative to their weighted proximity to functional assay results in a protein-protein interaction network. It is highly extensible, allowing incorporation of diverse data types to refine prioritization. In addition to a ranked list of variants, we have also devised a simple shortest path-based approach of visualizing the results in an intuitive manner to provide biological interpretation.

It is unknown whether solid tumors are part of the disease phenotype. PROCEDURE: We performed copy number alterations using Affymetrix human SNP 6.0 array. Furthermore, we did direct sequencing of pancreatic cancer-related genes and immunohistochemical expression of selective proteins. RESULTS: Among 41 patients with SDS who enrolled on the registry, we identified one male patient with a solid tumor: moderately differentiated pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. The tumor harbored 41 copy number alterations (CNAs) and had no regions of loss of heterozygosity (LOH). None of these CNAs were exclusive to the tumor. One copy of the tumor suppressor genes CTNNA3 and LGALS9C was lost in both the peripheral blood and tumor. Direct sequencing of TP53, KRAS, and NRAS revealed no mutations. Immunohistochemical staining for cyclin D1, E-cadherin, p53 MLH1 and MSH2 and beta-catenin, was similar to that seen in non-hereditary pancreatic cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Our case raises the possibility that solid tumors are associated with SDS, thereby broadening the clinical phenotype of the disease. The relatively young age at cancer diagnosis and the specific involvement of the pancreas make the possibility of an association with SDS likely. Similar to leukemia in SDS, the pancreatic cancer developed in hypoplastic tissues. This observation and the relative genomic stability of the tumor strengthen the hypothesis of improved adaptation of malignant clones among a population of disadvantaged cells as a mechanism for tumor expansion in SDS.","['Copyright (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Dhanraj, Santhosh', 'Manji, Arif', 'Pinto, Dalila', 'Scherer, Stephen W', 'Favre, Helen', 'Loh, Mignon L', 'Chetty, Runjan', 'Wei, Alice C', 'Dror, Yigal']","['Dhanraj S', 'Manji A', 'Pinto D', 'Scherer SW', 'Favre H', 'Loh ML', 'Chetty R', 'Wei AC', 'Dror Y']","['Cell Biology Program, Research Institute, The Hospital for Sick Children, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130109,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (CTNNA3 protein, human)', '0 (Galectins)', '0 (LGALS9 protein, human)', '0 (alpha Catenin)', 'Shwachman syndrome']",IM,,"['Adenocarcinoma/complications/*genetics', 'Adult', 'Base Sequence', 'Bone Marrow Diseases/complications/*genetics', 'DNA Copy Number Variations', 'Exocrine Pancreatic Insufficiency/complications/*genetics', 'Galectins/*genetics', 'Genome-Wide Association Study', 'Humans', 'Lipomatosis/complications/*genetics', 'Male', 'Pancreatic Neoplasms/complications/*genetics', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Shwachman-Diamond Syndrome', 'alpha Catenin/*genetics']",,,2013/01/11 06:00,2013/05/23 06:00,['2013/01/11 06:00'],"['2012/06/09 00:00 [received]', '2012/12/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/01/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/01/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.24453 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2013 May;60(5):754-60. doi: 10.1002/pbc.24453.

HSP70 is marginally expressed in nontransformed cells, but is greatly overexpressed in tumor cells. Silencing HSP70 is uniformly cytotoxic to tumor but not normal cells; therefore, there has been great interest in the development of HSP70 inhibitors for cancer therapy. Here, we report that the HSP70 inhibitor 2-phenylethynesulfonamide (PES) binds to the substrate-binding domain of HSP70 and requires the C-terminal helical ""lid"" of this protein (amino acids 573-616) to bind. Using molecular modeling and in silico docking, we have identified a candidate binding site for PES in this region of HSP70, and we identify point mutants that fail to interact with PES. A preliminary structure-activity relationship analysis has revealed a derivative of PES, 2-(3-chlorophenyl) ethynesulfonamide (PES-Cl), which shows increased cytotoxicity and ability to inhibit autophagy, along with significantly improved ability to extend the life of mice with pre-B-cell lymphoma, compared with the parent compound (P = 0.015). Interestingly, we also show that these HSP70 inhibitors impair the activity of the anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) in cell-free extracts, and induce G2-M arrest and genomic instability in cancer cells.

In particular, all members of the human LIM-domain-only (LMO) proteins, LMO1-4, which are required for many developmental processes, are implicated in the onset or the progression of several cancers, including T cell leukaemia, breast cancer and neuroblastoma. These small proteins contain two protein-interacting LIM domains but little additional sequence, and they seem to function by nucleating the formation of new transcriptional complexes and/or by disrupting existing transcriptional complexes to modulate gene expression programmes. Through these activities, the LMO proteins have important cellular roles in processes that are relevant to cancer such as self-renewal, cell cycle regulation and metastasis. These functions highlight the therapeutic potential of targeting these proteins in cancer.",,"['Matthews, Jacqueline M', 'Lester, Krystal', 'Joseph, Soumya', 'Curtis, David J']","['Matthews JM', 'Lester K', 'Joseph S', 'Curtis DJ']","['School of Molecular Bioscience, The University of Sydney, New South Wales 2006, Australia. jacqui.matthews@ sydney.edu.au']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20130110,England,Nat Rev Cancer,Nature reviews.

The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) translational isoforms have distinct proapoptotic activities in osteosarcoma cells. Here we determined whether GR isoforms selectively induce apoptosis in Jurkat T lymphoblastic leukemia cells. Jurkat cells stably expressing individual GR isoforms were generated and treated with vehicle or dexamethasone (DEX). DEX induced apoptosis in cells expressing the GR-A, -B, or -C, but not the GR-D, isoform. cDNA microarray analyses of cells sensitive (GR-C3) and insensitive (GR-D3) to DEX revealed glucocorticoid-induced proapoptotic transcriptomes. Genes that were regulated by the proapoptotic GR-C3, but not by the GR-D3, isoform likely contributed to glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis. The identified genes include those that are directly involved in apoptosis and those that facilitate cell killing. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that distinct chromatin modification abilities may underlie the distinct functions of GR isoforms. Interestingly, all GR isoforms, including the GR-D3 isoform, suppressed mitogen-stimulated cytokines. Furthermore, the GR-C isoforms were selectively upregulated in mitogen-activated primary T cells and DEX treatment induced GR-C target genes in activated T cells. Cell-specific expressions and functions of GR isoforms may help to explain the tissue- and individual-selective actions of glucocorticoids and may provide a basis for developing improved glucocorticoids.",,"['Wu, I', 'Shin, S C', 'Cao, Y', 'Bender, I K', 'Jafari, N', 'Feng, G', 'Lin, S', 'Cidlowski, J A', 'Schleimer, R P', 'Lu, N Z']","['Wu I', 'Shin SC', 'Cao Y', 'Bender IK', 'Jafari N', 'Feng G', 'Lin S', 'Cidlowski JA', 'Schleimer RP', 'Lu NZ']","['Division of Allergy-Immunology, Department of Medicine, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL 60611, USA.']",['eng'],"['3R01HL094558-01A1S1/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', '2R37HL068546-26/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL094558/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', '1R01HL094558-01A1/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 HL068546/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20130110,England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BCL2L11 protein, human)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Receptors, Glucocorticoid)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)']",IM,,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/metabolism', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11', 'Chromatin/metabolism', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Dexamethasone/*toxicity', 'Glucocorticoids/*toxicity', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism', 'MicroRNAs/metabolism', 'Protein Isoforms/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/metabolism', 'Receptors, Glucocorticoid/genetics/*metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/immunology/metabolism', '*Transcriptome']",PMC3563981,,2013/01/11 06:00,2013/06/19 06:00,['2013/01/11 06:00'],"['2013/01/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/01/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/19 06:00 [medline]']","['cddis2012193 [pii]', '10.1038/cddis.2012.193 [doi]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2013 Jan 10;4:e453. doi: 10.1038/cddis.2012.193.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The experiment was performed on acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line (CCRF-CEM) and lymphocytes from peripheral blood of healthy, adult subjects. To evaluate the level of DNA damage the comet assay in the alkaline version was used. RESULTS: We observed a significant difference in DNA damage level between normal and cancer cells in the presence of zinc.

Advances are needed, both in current therapies and in the development of new strategies. Partly from studying the nuances of the curative potential of stem cell transplant, we have come to appreciate the relevance of the immune response and the potential of immunotherapy. METHODS: This review article summarizes the recent advances in the field of immunology and immunotherapy for leukemia. RESULTS: In passive immunotherapy, recent progress in chimeric T-cell antigen receptor technology has been encouraging. In active immunotherapy, a cancer vaccine may potentially enhance HSCT. An overview of various clinical studies of peptide vaccination strategies focusing on molecular targets such as the Wilms' tumor gene 1 (WT1), proteinase 3 (PR3), and receptor for hyaluronan acid-mediated motility (RHAMM) is provided. Cell-based vaccination strategies are also briefly explored.

Although first identified in association with a chromosomal translocation in T-ALL, the ectopic expression of LMO1 occurs far more frequently in the absence of any known mutation involving its locus. Given that LMO1 is barely expressed in any haematopoietic lineage, and activation of transcriptional drivers in leukaemic cells is not well described, we investigated the regulation of this gene in normal haematopoietic and leukaemic cells. We show that LMO1 has two promoters that drive reporter gene expression in transgenic mice to neural tissues known to express endogenous LMO1. The LMO1 promoters display bivalent histone marks in multiple blood lineages including T-cells, and a 3' flanking region at LMO1 +57 contains a transcriptional enhancer that is active in developing blood cells in transgenic mouse embryos. The LMO1 promoters become activated in T-ALL together with the 3' enhancer, which is bound in primary T-ALL cells by SCL/TAL1 and GATA3. Taken together, our results show that LMO1 is poised for expression in normal progenitors, where activation of SCL/TAL1 together with a breakdown of epigenetic repression of LMO1 regulatory elements induces ectopic LMO1 expression that contributes to the development and maintenance of T-ALL.",,"['Oram, S H', 'Thoms, J', 'Sive, J I', 'Calero-Nieto, F J', 'Kinston, S J', 'Schutte, J', 'Knezevic, K', 'Lock, R B', 'Pimanda, J E', 'Gottgens, B']","['Oram SH', 'Thoms J', 'Sive JI', 'Calero-Nieto FJ', 'Kinston SJ', 'Schutte J', 'Knezevic K', 'Lock RB', 'Pimanda JE', 'Gottgens B']","['Department of Haematology, Cambridge Institute for Medical Research and Wellcome Trust and MRC Cambridge Stem Cell Institute, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.']",['eng'],"['079249/WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'G0900729/1/NC3RS_/National Centre for the Replacement, Refinement and Reduction', 'of Animals in Research/United Kingdom', '12765/CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom', '100140/WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'MC_PC_12009/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130110,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (LIM Domain Proteins)', '0 (LMO1 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', '*Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Humans', 'LIM Domain Proteins/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', '*Oncogenes', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics']",PMC3677138,,2013/01/11 06:00,2013/08/10 06:00,['2013/01/11 06:00'],"['2013/01/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/01/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/10 06:00 [medline]']","['leu20132 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2013.2 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2013 Jun;27(6):1348-57. doi: 10.1038/leu.2013.2.

METHOD: Of the 24 consecutive cases, 16 were boys and 8 were girls. The median age of patients was 12 (3 - 16) years old; 16 cases were in chronic phase (CP) of CML, 1 case in accelerated phase (AP) and 5 cases in blastic phase (BP). Allo-HSCT from HLA identical siblings were performed for 5 cases, HLA haplotype was performed for 14 cases and unrelated allo-HSCT for 5 cases. Twenty-four cases underwent allo-HSCT with conditioning regimen of BUCY. Prophylaxis of graft versus host disease (GVHD) included CsA + MTX plus MMF. The average follow-up was 36 months. RESULT: All of patients were successfully engrafted. The 5-year overall survival (OS) of the 24 cases was 81%. Four patients died after allo-HSCT including 3 cases in BP from haploidentical donors and 1 case in CP from HLA identical sibling. The 5 cases who received unrelated allo-HSCT have been alive. Among the 10 cases who survived over 5 years, 3 had chronic GVHD. CONCLUSION: Children with CML could be treated effectively with allo-HSCT. There were no significant differences among different donors. Transplantation to children with CML should be performed as early as possible.

We designed a receptor termed NKG2D-DAP10-CD3zeta that is composed of the NK cell activating molecule NKG2D plus 2 key signaling molecules, DAP10 and CD3zeta, and evaluated its capacity to promote cancer cell killing. Retroviral transduction of NKG2D-DAP10-CD3zeta markedly increased NKG2D surface expression in NK cells, which became consistently more cytotoxic than mock-transduced cells against leukemia and solid tumor cell lines. In contrast, there was no increase in cytotoxicity against nontransformed blood and mesenchymal cells. NKG2D blockade abrogated gains in cytotoxicity to cancer cells. Receptor stimulation triggered signal transduction, secretion of IFN-gamma, GM-CSF, IL-13, MIP-1alpha, MIP-1beta, CCL5, and TNF-alpha, and massive release of cytotoxic granules, which persisted after 48 hours of continuous stimulation. NKG2D-DAP10-CD3zeta-expressing NK cells had considerable antitumor activity in a mouse model of osteosarcoma, whereas activated NK cells were ineffective. Thus, the cytotoxic potential of NK cells against a wide spectrum of tumor subtypes could be markedly enhanced by expression of NKG2D-DAP10-CD3zeta receptors.

Further mutations affecting the Janus kinase family have been discovered mostly in leukaemias and in myeloproliferative neoplasms. Owing to their involvement in neoplasia, inflammatory diseases and in the immune response, Janus kinases are promising targets for kinase inhibitor therapy in these disease settings. Various quantitative assays including two newly developed screening assays were used to characterize the function of different small-molecule compounds in cells expressing Jak2V617F. A detailed comparative analysis of different Janus kinase inhibitors in our quantitative assays and the subsequent characterization of additional activities demonstrated for the first time that the most potent Jak2 inhibitor in our study, CEP701, also targets Aurora kinases. CEP701 shows a unique combination of both activities which is not found in other compounds also targeting Jak2. Furthermore, colony forming cell assays showed that Janus kinase 2 inhibitors preferentially suppressed the growth of erythroid colonies, whereas inhibitors of Aurora kinases preferentially blocked myeloid colony growth. CEP701 demonstrated a combined suppression of both colony types. Moreover, we show that combined application of a Janus and an Aurora kinase inhibitor recapitulated the effect observed for CEP701 but might allow for more flexibility in combining both activities in clinical settings, e.g. in the treatment of myeloproliferative neoplasms. The newly developed screening assays are high throughput compatible and allow an easy detection of new compounds with Janus kinase 2 inhibitory activity.","['(c) 2012 The Authors.

Mcl-1 expression was low directly ex vivo (P < 0.01), and Bim was up-regulated after antigen encounter (P < 0.05) of CD127(low) pentamer(+) cells. The ex vivo difference between Mcl-1 and Bim expression on pentamer(+) cells correlated positively with CD127 expression level (P < 0.001) and with pentamer(+) cell reactivity (P < 0.05). In summary, a low ex vivo Mcl-1 expression and Bim up-regulation after antigen encounter are involved in CD127(low) HCV-specific CTL hyporeactivity during chronic infection, but it can be overcome by apoptosis blockade.",['(c) 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.'],"['Larrubia, J R', 'Lokhande, M U', 'Garcia-Garzon, S', 'Miquel, J', 'Gonzalez-Praetorius, A', 'Parra-Cid, T', 'Sanz-de-Villalobos, E']","['Larrubia JR', 'Lokhande MU', 'Garcia-Garzon S', 'Miquel J', 'Gonzalez-Praetorius A', 'Parra-Cid T', 'Sanz-de-Villalobos E']","['Translational Hepatology Unit, Guadalajara University Hospital, University of Alcala, Guadalajara, Spain. jlarrubiam@meditex.es']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120503,England,J Viral Hepat,Journal of viral hepatitis,9435672,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BCL2L11 protein, human)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Interleukin-7 Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Apoptosis', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/*metabolism', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Down-Regulation', 'Female', 'Hepacivirus/*immunology/physiology', 'Hepatitis C, Chronic/*immunology/metabolism/virology', 'Host-Pathogen Interactions', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/metabolism', 'Interleukin-7 Receptor alpha Subunit/*genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins/*metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Phenotype', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*physiology/virology', 'Virus Replication']",,,2013/01/11 06:00,2013/06/14 06:00,['2013/01/11 06:00'],"['2013/01/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/01/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2893.2012.01618.x [doi]'],ppublish,J Viral Hepat. 2013 Feb;20(2):85-94. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2893.2012.01618.x.

METHODS: We performed mutational analysis, including fragment analysis and direct sequencing of exon 12 of the NPM1 gene, on 83 AML patients to characterize the NPM1 mutations completely. RESULTS: In this study, NPM1 mutations were identified in 19 (22.9%) of the 83 AML patients and in 12 (42.9%) of the 28 CN-AML patients. Among the 19 patients with NPM1 mutations, type A NPM1 mutations were identified in 16 (84.2%) patients, whereas non-A type NPM1 mutations were observed in 3 (15.8%) patients. Two of the 3 non-A type NPM1 mutations were novel: c.867_868insAAAC and c.869_873indelCTTTAGCCC. These 2 novel mutant proteins display a nuclear export signal motif (L-xxx-L-xx-V-x-L) less frequently and exhibit a mutation at tryptophan 290 that disrupts the nucleolar localization signal. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that novel NPM1 mutations may be non-rare and that supplementary sequence analysis is needed along with conventional targeted mutational analysis to detect non-A types of NPM1 mutations.",,"['Jeon, Yongbum', 'Seo, Sang Won', 'Park, Seonyang', 'Park, Seungman', 'Kim, So Yeon', 'Ra, Eun Kyung', 'Park, Sung Sup', 'Seong, Moon-Woo']","['Jeon Y', 'Seo SW', 'Park S', 'Park S', 'Kim SY', 'Ra EK', 'Park SS', 'Seong MW']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20121217,Korea (South),Ann Lab Med,Annals of laboratory medicine,101571172,"['0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Amino Acid Motifs', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Exons', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Young Adult']",PMC3535198,,2013/01/10 06:00,2013/11/15 06:00,['2013/01/10 06:00'],"['2012/06/20 00:00 [received]', '2012/09/04 00:00 [revised]', '2012/11/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/01/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/01/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3343/alm.2013.33.1.60 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Lab Med. 2013 Jan;33(1):60-4. doi: 10.3343/alm.2013.33.1.60.

However, the way in which the transcriptomic data of pathological cells relate to the transcriptomes of normal cellular counterparts has not been fully explored, and may provide new and unbiased insights into the mechanisms of these diseases. To achieve this, it is necessary to develop a method to simultaneously analyse components across different levels, namely genes, normal cells, and diseases. Here we propose a multidimensional method that visualises the cross-level relationships between these components at three different levels based on transcriptomic data of physiological and pathological processes, by adapting Canonical Correspondence Analysis, which was developed in ecology and sociology, to microarray data (CCA on Microarray data, CCAM). Using CCAM, we have analysed transcriptomes of haematological disorders and those of normal haematopoietic cell differentiation. First, by analysing leukaemia data, CCAM successfully visualised known relationships between leukaemia subtypes and cellular differentiation, and their characteristic genes, which confirmed the relevance of CCAM. Next, by analysing transcriptomes of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), we have shown that CCAM was effective in both generating and testing hypotheses. CCAM showed that among MDS patients, high-risk patients had transcriptomes that were more similar to those of both haematopoietic stem cells (HSC) and megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitors (MEP) than low-risk patients, and provided a prognostic model. Collectively, CCAM reveals hidden relationships between pathological and physiological processes and gene expression, providing meaningful clinical insights into haematological diseases, and these could not be revealed by other univariate and multivariate methods. Furthermore, CCAM was effective in identifying candidate genes that are correlated with cellular phenotypes of interest. We expect that CCAM will benefit a wide range of medical fields.",,"['Ono, Masahiro', 'Tanaka, Reiko J', 'Kano, Manabu', 'Sugiman, Toshio']","['Ono M', 'Tanaka RJ', 'Kano M', 'Sugiman T']","['Immunobiology Unit, Institute of Child Health, University College London, London, United Kingdom. m.ono@ucl.ac.uk']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130102,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)']",IM,,"['Algorithms', 'Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Computational Biology/methods', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*methods', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Hematologic Diseases/*genetics/physiopathology', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia/metabolism', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/methods', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Stem Cells', 'Transcriptome']",PMC3534650,,2013/01/10 06:00,2013/08/21 06:00,['2013/01/10 06:00'],"['2012/08/28 00:00 [received]', '2012/12/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/01/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/01/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/21 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0053544 [doi]', 'PONE-D-12-26227 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2013;8(1):e53544. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0053544.

High throughput sequencing identified an endogenous retroviral class II intracisternal A particle insertion in Tal1 intron 4.

Gain-of-function mutations of the receptor contribute to the transformation of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Src-like adaptor protein (SLAP) is an interaction partner of the E3 ubiquitin ligase Cbl that can regulate receptor tyrosine kinases-mediated signal transduction. In this study, we analyzed the role of SLAP in signal transduction downstream of the type III receptor tyrosine kinase Flt3. The results show that upon ligand stimulation SLAP stably associates with Flt3 through multiple phosphotyrosine residues in Flt3. SLAP constitutively interacts with oncogenic Flt3-ITD and co-localizes with Flt3 near the cell membrane. This association initiates Cbl-dependent receptor ubiquitination and degradation. Depletion of SLAP expression by shRNA in Flt3-transfected Ba/F3 cells resulted in a weaker activation of FL-induced PI3K-Akt and MAPK signaling. Meta-analysis of microarray data from patient samples suggests that SLAP mRNA is differentially expressed in different cancers and its expression was significantly increased in patients carrying the Flt3-ITD mutation.

For modeling the complexity of the human disease, primary tumor cells are by far superior to established cell lines. As qualified exemplary model, patients' acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells reliably engraft in mice inducing orthotopic disseminated leukemia closely resembling the disease in men. Unfortunately, disease monitoring of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in mice is hampered by lack of a suitable readout parameter. DESIGN AND METHODS: Patients' acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells were lentivirally transduced to express the membrane-bound form of Gaussia luciferase. In vivo imaging was established in individual patients' leukemias and extensively validated. RESULTS: Bioluminescence in vivo imaging enabled reliable and continuous follow-up of individual mice. Light emission strictly correlated to post mortem quantification of leukemic burden and revealed a logarithmic, time and cell number dependent growth pattern. Imaging conveniently quantified frequencies of leukemia initiating cells in limiting dilution transplantation assays. Upon detecting a single leukemia cell within more than 10,000 bone marrow cells, imaging enabled monitoring minimal residual disease, time to tumor re-growth and relapse. Imaging quantified therapy effects precisely and with low variances, discriminating treatment failure from partial and complete responses. CONCLUSIONS: For the first time, we characterized in detail how in vivo imaging reforms preclinical studies on patient-derived tumors upon increasing monitoring resolution. In the future, in vivo imaging will enable performing precise preclinical studies on a broad range of highly demanding clinical challenges, such as treatment failure, resistance in leukemia initiating cells, minimal residual disease and relapse.",,"['Terziyska, Nadia', 'Castro Alves, Catarina', 'Groiss, Volker', 'Schneider, Katja', 'Farkasova, Katarina', 'Ogris, Manfred', 'Wagner, Ernst', 'Ehrhardt, Harald', 'Brentjens, Renier J', 'zur Stadt, Udo', 'Horstmann, Martin', 'Quintanilla-Martinez, Leticia', 'Jeremias, Irmela']","['Terziyska N', 'Castro Alves C', 'Groiss V', 'Schneider K', 'Farkasova K', 'Ogris M', 'Wagner E', 'Ehrhardt H', 'Brentjens RJ', 'zur Stadt U', 'Horstmann M', 'Quintanilla-Martinez L', 'Jeremias I']","['Department of Gene Vectors, Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, German Research Center for Environmental Health, Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],['P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121231,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage', 'Cell Tracking', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Luciferases/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Precision Medicine', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Recombinant Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Tumor Burden/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Whole Body Imaging', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays/*methods']",PMC3534096,,2013/01/10 06:00,2013/06/29 06:00,['2013/01/10 06:00'],"['2012/08/09 00:00 [received]', '2012/11/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/01/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/01/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/29 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0052798 [doi]', 'PONE-D-12-23914 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2012;7(12):e52798. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0052798.

We have previously found that resistance to the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib in 3D can be explained by a lack of upregulation of Noxa, the pro-apoptotic BH3 sensitizer that acts via displacement of the Bak/Bax-activator BH3-only protein, Bim. We hypothesized that the histone deacetylase inhibitor vorinostat might reverse this block to Noxa upregulation in 3D. Indeed, we found that vorinostat effectively restored upregulation of Noxa protein and message and abolished multicellular resistance to bortezomib in the 3D spheroids. The ability of vorinostat to reverse resistance was ablated by knockdown of Noxa or Bim, confirming the essential role of the Noxa/Bim axis in the response to vorinostat. Addition of vorinostat similarly increased the apoptotic response to bortezomib in another 3D model, the tumor fragment spheroid, which is grown from human mesothelioma ex vivo. In addition to its benefit when used with bortezomib, vorinostat also enhanced the response to cisplatin plus pemetrexed, as shown in both 3D models. Our results using clinically relevant 3D models show that the manipulation of the core apoptotic repertoire may improve the chemosensitivity of mesothelioma. Whereas neither vorinostat nor bortezomib alone has been clinically effective in mesothelioma, vorinostat may undermine chemoresistance to bortezomib and to other therapies thereby providing a rationale for combinatorial strategies.",,"['Barbone, Dario', 'Cheung, Priscilla', 'Battula, Sailaja', 'Busacca, Sara', 'Gray, Steven G', 'Longley, Daniel B', 'Bueno, Raphael', 'Sugarbaker, David J', 'Fennell, Dean A', 'Broaddus, V Courtney']","['Barbone D', 'Cheung P', 'Battula S', 'Busacca S', 'Gray SG', 'Longley DB', 'Bueno R', 'Sugarbaker DJ', 'Fennell DA', 'Broaddus VC']","['Lung Biology Center, San Francisco General Hospital, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California, United States of America. dario.barbone@ucsf.edu']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121226,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BCL2L11 protein, human)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Boronic Acids)', '0 (Glutamates)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (PMAIP1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '04Q9AIZ7NO (Pemetrexed)', '58IFB293JI (Vorinostat)', '5Z93L87A1R (Guanine)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/metabolism', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11', 'Boronic Acids/pharmacology', 'Bortezomib', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cisplatin/pharmacology', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Synergism', 'Gene Expression/*drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Glutamates/pharmacology', 'Guanine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/*pharmacology', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism', 'Mesothelioma', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Pemetrexed', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*genetics/metabolism', 'Pyrazines/pharmacology', 'Spheroids, Cellular/*drug effects/physiology', 'Up-Regulation', 'Vorinostat']",PMC3530471,,2013/01/10 06:00,2013/06/29 06:00,['2013/01/10 06:00'],"['2012/08/21 00:00 [received]', '2012/11/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/01/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/01/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/29 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0052753 [doi]', 'PONE-D-12-25149 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2012;7(12):e52753. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0052753.

Azacitidine has promising activity in patients with low proliferating AML. The aim of this dose-finding part of this trial was to evaluate feasibility and safety of azacitidine combined with a cytarabine- and daunorubicin-based chemotherapy in older patients with AML. TRIAL DESIGN: Prospective, randomised, open, phase II trial with parallel group design and fixed sample size. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients aged 61 years or older, with untreated acute myeloid leukemia with a leukocyte count of <20,000/microl at the time of study entry and adequate organ function were eligible. Patients were randomised to receive azacitidine either 37.5 (dose level 1) or 75 mg/sqm (dose level 2) for five days before each cycle of induction (7+3 cytarabine plus daunorubicine) and consolidation (intermediate-dose cytarabine) therapy. Dose-limiting toxicity was the primary endpoint. RESULTS: Six patients each were randomised into each dose level and evaluable for analysis. No dose-limiting toxicity occurred in either dose level. Nine serious adverse events occurred in five patients (three in the 37.5 mg, two in the 75 mg arm) with two fatal outcomes. Two patients at the 37.5 mg/sqm dose level and four patients at the 75 mg/sqm level achieved a complete remission after induction therapy. Median overall survival was 266 days and median event-free survival 215 days after a median follow up of 616 days. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of azacitidine 75 mg/sqm with standard induction therapy is feasible in older patients with AML and was selected as an investigational arm in the randomised controlled part of this phase-II study, which is currently halted due to an increased cardiac toxicity observed in the experimental arm.

Here we determine genome-wide transcription profiles during undirected differentiation of severely hypomethylated (Dnmt1(-)/(-)) embryonic stem cells (ESCs) as well as ESCs completely devoid of DNA methylation (Dnmt1(-)/(-);Dnmt3a(-)/(-);Dnmt3b(-)/(-) or TKO) and assay their potential to transit in and out of the ESC state. We find that the expression of only few genes mainly associated with germ line function and the X chromosome is affected in undifferentiated TKO ESCs. Upon initial differentiation as embryoid bodies (EBs) wild type, Dnmt1(-)/(-) and TKO cells downregulate pluripotency associated genes and upregulate lineage specific genes, but their transcription profiles progressively diverge upon prolonged EB culture. While Oct4 protein levels are completely and homogeneously suppressed, transcription of Oct4 and Nanog is not completely silenced even at late stages in both Dnmt1(-)/(-) and TKO EBs. Despite late wild type and Dnmt1(-)/(-) EBs showing a much higher degree of concordant expression, after EB dissociation and replating under pluripotency promoting conditions both Dnmt1(-)/(-) and TKO cells, but not wild type cells rapidly revert to expression profiles typical of undifferentiated ESCs.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationships between pretreatment risk factors, drug pharmacokinetics, and TLS. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: A population pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model linking drug exposure and TLS was developed. Plasma data of flavopiridol and its glucuronide metabolite (flavo-G) were obtained from 111 patients treated in early-phase trials with frequent sampling following initial and/or escalated doses. TLS grading was modeled with logistic regression as a pharmacodynamic endpoint. Demographics, baseline disease status, and blood chemistry variables were evaluated as covariates. RESULTS: Gender was the most significant pharmacokinetic covariate, with females displaying higher flavo-G exposure than males. Glucuronide metabolite exposure was predictive of TLS occurrence, and bulky lymphadenopathy was identified as a significant covariate on TLS probability. The estimated probability of TLS occurrence in patients with baseline bulky lymphadenopathy less than 10 cm or 10 cm or more during the first 2 treatments was 0.111 (SE% 13.0%) and 0.265 (SE% 17.9%), respectively, when flavo-G area under the plasma concentration versus time curve was at its median value in whole-patient group. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first population pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model of TLS.

Programmed death-1 is a receptor involved in tumor-mediated immunosuppression through binding of the PD-L1 ligand. Multiparametric flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry were used to study PD-1/PD-L1 expression. Functional assays were used to determine the involvement of the PD-1/PD-L1 axis in T-cell responses. PD-1 expression by CD4(+) and CD8(+) T lymphocytes was significantly higher in 117 chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients than in 33 donors of a comparable age. CD4(+) and CD8(+) T lymphocytes from chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients displayed increased numbers of effector memory and terminally differentiated cells, respectively, when compared to controls. The number of effector memory CD4(+) and terminally differentiated CD8(+) lymphocytes positively associated with a more advanced stage of disease, treatment requirements and unfavorable genomic aberrations. Furthermore, leukemic lymphocytes expressed higher levels of PD-L1 than circulating B lymphocytes from normal donors. PD-1 and PD-L1 surface expression spiked in proliferating T and B lymphocytes, suggesting that this interaction works efficiently in activated environments. Within chronic lymphocytic leukemia proliferation centers in the lymph node, CD4(+)/PD-1(+) T lymphocytes were found to be in close contact with PD-L1(+) chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells. Lastly, functional experiments using recombinant soluble PD-L1 and blocking antibodies indicated that this axis contributes to the inhibition of IFN-gamma production by CD8(+) T cells. These observations suggest that pharmacological manipulation of the PD-1/PD-L1 axis may contribute to restoring T-cell functions in the chronic lymphocytic leukemia microenvironment.",,"['Brusa, Davide', 'Serra, Sara', 'Coscia, Marta', 'Rossi, Davide', ""D'Arena, Giovanni"", 'Laurenti, Luca', 'Jaksic, Ozren', 'Fedele, Giorgio', 'Inghirami, Giorgio', 'Gaidano, Gianluca', 'Malavasi, Fabio', 'Deaglio, Silvia']","['Brusa D', 'Serra S', 'Coscia M', 'Rossi D', ""D'Arena G"", 'Laurenti L', 'Jaksic O', 'Fedele G', 'Inghirami G', 'Gaidano G', 'Malavasi F', 'Deaglio S']","['Human Genetics Foundation (HuGeF) and Department of Medical Sciences, University of Turin, Turin, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130108,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (B7-H1 Antigen)', '0 (CD274 protein, human)', '0 (PDCD1 protein, human)', '0 (Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'B7-H1 Antigen/genetics/*metabolism', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/metabolism/pathology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Memory', 'Interferon-gamma/biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/*metabolism/pathology']",PMC3669453,,2013/01/10 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2013/01/10 06:00'],"['2013/01/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/01/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2012.077537 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2012.077537 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2013 Jun;98(6):953-63. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2012.077537.

CASE SUMMARY: A 69-year-old man recently diagnosed with chronic phase CML received nilotinib 300 mg twice daily and was admitted with acute pancreatitis that appeared the day after the first dose. The patient had normal levels of triglycerides and denied alcohol use. Serum pancreatic enzymes were within normal limits the day before nilotinib initiation. Abdominal computed tomography demonstrated a normal liver, bile duct without stones, and findings that were consistent with focal pancreatitis. The patient's history was significant for concomitant use of enalapril and simvastatin; both have been associated with pancreatitis, but the patient had been taking these medications for at least 5 years without adverse effects. Nilotinib was immediately discontinued. Abdominal pain resolved and serum pancreatic enzymes levels returned to normal 2 weeks later. DISCUSSION: One of the adverse effects of some tyrosine kinase inhibitors is increased levels of serum pancreatic enzymes. Accordingly, nilotinib labeling includes ""high lipase levels in serum"" as an adverse event. There are few case reports of acute pancreatitis associated with nilotinib in the literature and some are incomplete. We present a well-documented case of nilotinib-associated acute pancreatitis. Consistent with Badalov's new classification system for drug-induced acute pancreatitis and with the Naranjo probability scale, this case represents a possible adverse reaction of pancreatitis associated with nilotinib therapy. As rechallenge is unethical, treatment with nilotinib has not been resumed. CONCLUSIONS: This case demonstrates a possible association between acute pancreatitis and nilotinib use. Although a rare phenomenon, clinicians should be alert for signs and symptoms of pancreatitis, as treatment with nilotinib for CML is becoming more common.",,"['Engel, Tal', 'Justo, Dan', 'Amitai, Michal', 'Volchek, Yulia', 'Mayan, Haim']","['Engel T', 'Justo D', 'Amitai M', 'Volchek Y', 'Mayan H']","['Department of Internal Medicine E, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel-Hashomer, Israel. talengel@gmail.com']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20130108,United States,Ann Pharmacother,The Annals of pharmacotherapy,9203131,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)']",IM,,"['Abdominal Pain/etiology', 'Acute Disease', 'Aged', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Pancreatitis/*chemically induced/physiopathology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/*adverse effects/therapeutic use']",,,2013/01/10 06:00,2013/07/09 06:00,['2013/01/10 06:00'],"['2013/01/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/01/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/09 06:00 [medline]']","['aph.1R334 [pii]', '10.1345/aph.1R334 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Pharmacother. 2013 Jan;47(1):e3. doi: 10.1345/aph.1R334.

The interaction has been shown to influence the outcome of allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Homozygous C1 or C2 and heterozygous C1/C2 were divided by HLA-Cw typing and they influenced the outcome of HSCT. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the study was to analyse the impact of interaction between recipient HLA-Cw and donor KIR on outcome. METHODS: The genotypes of recipient HLA-Cw ligands and donor KIRs were correlated with the clinical outcomes of 52 patients who received HLA-matched, sibling donor HSCT for myeloid malignancies. RESULTS: The incidence of chronic graft versus host disease (GVHD) was significantly lower in C1 or C2 homozygotes than in C1/C2 heterozygotes (p = 0.000). Higher overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) rates were observed in C1 or C2 homozygotes than in C1/C2 heterozygotes (OS, 81% +/- 8% vs 54% +/- 10%, p = 0.034; DFS, 81% +/- 8% vs 54% +/- 10%, p = 0.024). A lower incidence of chronic GVHD and higher OS and DFS were observed in the HLA-KIR mismatched group (chronic GVHD, p = 0.007; OS, 84% +/- 7% vs 47% +/- 13%, p = 0.003; DFS, 84% +/- 7% vs 47% +/- 13%, p = 0.002). CONCLUSION: The interaction between recipient HLA ligand and donor KIR had a significant impact on the outcome of patients receiving matched sibling HSCT.

In haplo-HSCT, alloreactivity plays a major role in the graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect, which, however, is frequently followed by relapse due to emerging leukemic cell variants that have lost the unshared HLA haplotype as a mechanism of immune escape. We report that stimulation of HLA-haploidentical donor T lymphocytes with leukemic antigen-presenting cells (L-APCs) expands a population of leukemia-reactive T cells, which, besides alloreactivity to unshared HLAs, contain leukemia-associated specificities restricted by shared HLAs. According to a preferential central-memory (T(CM)) phenotype and to high interleukin (IL)-7Ralpha expression, these T cells persist in vivo and sustain a major GVL effect in a clinically relevant xenograft model. Moreover, we demonstrate that modifying L-APC-expanded T cells to express the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV-tk) suicide gene enables their elimination with the prodrug ganciclovir (GCV), therefore providing a safety switch in case of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).

Despite its relatively good prognosis, there is a steady search for strategies to improve treatment effects and prevent the undesired side effects on normal cells. In the present paper, we demonstrate a differential effect of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) signaling between normal BCPs and BCP-ALL blasts, pointing to a potential therapeutic window allowing for manipulation of cAMP signaling in the treatment of BCP-ALL. By studying primary cells collected from pediatric BCP-ALL patients and healthy controls, we found that cAMP profoundly decreased basal and DNA damage-induced p53 levels and cell death in malignant cells, whereas normal BCP counterparts displayed slightly augmented cell death when exposed to cAMP-increasing agents. We did not find evidence for a selection process involving generation of increased basal cAMP levels in BCP-ALL cells, but we demonstrate that paracrine signaling involving prostaglandin E2-induced cAMP generation has the potential to suppress p53 activation and cell death induction. The selective inhibitory effect of cAMP signaling on DNA damage-induced cell death in BCP-ALL cells appears to be an acquired trait associated with malignant transformation, potentially allowing the use of inhibitors of this pathway for directed killing of the malignant blasts.",,"['Naderi, Elin Hallan', 'Ugland, Hege Katrin', 'Diep, Phoi-Phoi', 'Josefsen, Dag', 'Ruud, Ellen', 'Naderi, Soheil', 'Blomhoff, Heidi Kiil']","['Naderi EH', 'Ugland HK', 'Diep PP', 'Josefsen D', 'Ruud E', 'Naderi S', 'Blomhoff HK']","['Department of Biochemistry, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130108,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Oxytocics)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '1F7A44V6OU (Colforsin)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'K7Q1JQR04M (Dinoprostone)']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Apoptosis', 'Blast Crisis/drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Colforsin/pharmacology', 'Cyclic AMP/*metabolism', 'DNA Damage/physiology/radiation effects', 'Dinoprostone/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Oxytocics/pharmacology', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'Precursor Cells, B-Lymphoid/*cytology/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/*metabolism', 'Young Adult']",,,2013/01/10 06:00,2013/05/08 06:00,['2013/01/10 06:00'],"['2013/01/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/01/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/08 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)42043-9 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2012-08-452698 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2013 Mar 7;121(10):1805-13. doi: 10.1182/blood-2012-08-452698.

TKI treatment effectively inhibits BCR-ABL kinase activity in CML LSCs, suggesting that additional kinase-independent mechanisms contribute to LSC preservation. We investigated whether signals from the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment protect CML LSCs from TKI treatment. Coculture with human BM mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) significantly inhibited apoptosis and preserved CML stem/progenitor cells following TKI exposure, maintaining colony-forming ability and engraftment potential in immunodeficient mice. We found that the N-cadherin receptor plays an important role in MSC-mediated protection of CML progenitors from TKI. N-cadherin-mediated adhesion to MSCs was associated with increased cytoplasmic N-cadherin-beta-catenin complex formation as well as enhanced beta-catenin nuclear translocation and transcriptional activity. Increased exogenous Wnt-mediated beta-catenin signaling played an important role in MSC-mediated protection of CML progenitors from TKI treatment. Our results reveal a close interplay between N-cadherin and the Wnt-beta-catenin pathway in protecting CML LSCs during TKI treatment. Importantly, these results reveal novel mechanisms of resistance of CML LSCs to TKI treatment and suggest new targets for treatment designed to eradicate residual LSCs in CML patients.",,"['Zhang, Bin', 'Li, Min', 'McDonald, Tinisha', 'Holyoake, Tessa L', 'Moon, Randall T', 'Campana, Dario', 'Shultz, Leonard', 'Bhatia, Ravi']","['Zhang B', 'Li M', 'McDonald T', 'Holyoake TL', 'Moon RT', 'Campana D', 'Shultz L', 'Bhatia R']","['Division of Hematopoietic Stem Cell and Leukemia Research, Beckman Research Institute, Duarte, CA 91010, USA.']",['eng'],"['U01 HL100395/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL077847/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL77847/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA034196/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA172447/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA34196/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA095684/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA95684/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '11008/CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom', 'C11074/A11008/CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom', 'R01 HL087825/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130108,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Cadherins)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (beta Catenin)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects/pathology', 'Cadherins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/*drug effects/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects/pathology', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', '*Tumor Microenvironment', 'beta Catenin/genetics/*metabolism']",PMC3591802,,2013/01/10 06:00,2013/05/08 06:00,['2013/01/10 06:00'],"['2013/01/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/01/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/08 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)42046-4 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2012-02-412890 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2013 Mar 7;121(10):1824-38. doi: 10.1182/blood-2012-02-412890.

METHODS: This is a descriptive cross-sectional study carried out in 112 CML patients who attended at different clinics of Khartoum state, Sudan from February 2007 to December 2010. Transcript analysis was successful in 109 venous blood and bone marrow samples using quantitative real-time-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RESULTS: The transcripts analysis of 109 patients showed that 32.1% (35/109) expressed one or both of the P210 BCR/ABL rearrangements (b2a2 and b3a2). Of those 35 (32.1%), 21 patients expressed b2a2, 6 expressed b3a2, and 8 expressed both transcripts b2a2/b3a2. The remaining 74 patients revealed transcripts combination of P190 BCR/ABL and P210 BCR/ABL (e1a2/b2a2/b3a2), of which 19 patients had all the transcripts (e1a2/b2a2/b3a2), 33 revealed 2 transcripts (e1a2/b2a2), and the remaining 22 patients had (e1a2/b3a2). CONCLUSION: The frequencies of BCR-ABL rearrangements in the Sudanese population demonstrated distinct profiles in contrast with the frequencies reported in similar studies conducted in other geographical regions.This might be due to the distinct ethnic group involved in this study which has been supported further by reported distinct genetic profiles in Sudanese patients with bladder and breast cancer.",,"['Muddathir, Abdelrahim M', 'Kordofani, Anwaar A', 'Fadl-Elmula, Imad M']","['Muddathir AM', 'Kordofani AA', 'Fadl-Elmula IM']","['Department of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Faculty of Medical Laboratory Sciences, Alzaiem Alazhari University, Khartoum, Sudan. abdelrahimm@gmail.com']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Saudi Arabia,Saudi Med J,Saudi medical journal,7909441,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,,"['Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Sudan']",,,2013/01/10 06:00,2013/11/19 06:00,['2013/01/10 06:00'],"['2013/01/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/01/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/19 06:00 [medline]']","[""20120362' [pii]""]",ppublish,Saudi Med J. 2013 Jan;34(1):29-33.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Over 350 million people are considered at risk of contracting leishmaniasis, and approximately 2 million new cases occur yearly(1). Leishmania donovani is the causative agent for visceral leishmaniasis (VL), the most fatal form of the disease. The choice of drugs available to treat leishmaniasis is limited (2);current treatments provide limited efficacy and many are toxic at therapeutic doses. In addition, most of the first line treatment drugs have already lost their utility due to increasing multiple drug resistance (3). The current pipeline of anti-leishmanial drugs is also severely depleted. Sustained efforts are needed to enrich a new anti-leishmanial drug discovery pipeline, and this endeavor relies on the availability of suitable in vitro screening models. In vitro promastigotes (4) and axenic amastigotes assays(5) are primarily used for anti-leishmanial drug screening however, may not be appropriate due to significant cellular, physiological, biochemical and molecular differences in comparison to intracellular amastigotes. Assays with macrophage-amastigotes models are considered closest to the pathophysiological conditions of leishmaniasis, and are therefore the most appropriate for in vitro screening. Differentiated, non-dividing human acute monocytic leukemia cells (THP1) (make an attractive) alternative to isolated primary macrophages and can be used for assaying anti-leishmanial activity of different compounds against intracellular amastigotes. Here, we present a parasite-rescue and transformation assay with differentiated THP1 cells infected in vitro with Leishmania donovani for screening pure compounds and natural products extracts and determining the efficacy against the intracellular Leishmania amastigotes. The assay involves the following steps: (1) differentiation of THP1 cells to non-dividing macrophages, (2) infection of macrophages with L. donovani metacyclic promastigotes, (3) treatment of infected cells with test drugs, (4) controlled lysis of infected macrophages, (5) release/rescue of amastigotes and (6) transformation of live amastigotes to promastigotes. The assay was optimized using detergent treatment for controlled lysis of Leishmania-infected THP1 cells to achieve almost complete rescue of viable intracellular amastigotes with minimal effect on their ability to transform to promastigotes. Different macrophage:promastigotes ratios were tested to achieve maximum infection. Quantification of the infection was performed through transformation of live, rescued Leishmania amastigotes to promastigotes and evaluation of their growth by an alamarBlue fluorometric assay in 96-well microplates. This assay is comparable to the currently-used microscopic, transgenic reporter gene and digital-image analysis assays. This assay is robust and measures only the live intracellular amastigotes compared to reporter gene and image analysis assays, which may not differentiate between live and dead amastigotes. Also, the assay has been validated with a current panel of anti-leishmanial drugs and has been successfully applied to large-scale screening of pure compounds and a library of natural products fractions (Tekwani et al. unpublished).",,"['Jain, Surendra K', 'Sahu, Rajnish', 'Walker, Larry A', 'Tekwani, Babu L']","['Jain SK', 'Sahu R', 'Walker LA', 'Tekwani BL']","['National Center for Natural Products Research, School of Pharmacy, University of Mississippi, Mississippi, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", 'Video-Audio Media']",20121230,United States,J Vis Exp,Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,101313252,['0 (Antiprotozoal Agents)'],IM,,"['Antiprotozoal Agents/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leishmania donovani/*drug effects/*growth & development', 'Leishmaniasis, Visceral/drug therapy/parasitology', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/*parasitology/pathology', 'Macrophages/parasitology/pathology']",PMC3577863,,2013/01/10 06:00,2013/03/01 06:00,['2013/01/10 06:00'],"['2013/01/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/01/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/01 06:00 [medline]']","['4054 [pii]', '10.3791/4054 [doi]']",epublish,J Vis Exp. 2012 Dec 30;(70). pii: 4054. doi: 10.3791/4054.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RECENT FINDINGS: JAK2V617F exerts its effects on cell growth via janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT) signalling and interactions with other molecules that normally negatively regulate signalling, such as suppressor of cell signalling 3. The role of mutant JAK2 on phenotype is discussed, as not all polycythemia vera patients appear to be homozygous for the JAK2V617F mutation. Other mutations in the JAK-STAT signalling cascade are reviewed, including JAK2 exon 12, myeloproliferative leukemia virus oncogene, LNK (also known as SH2B3) mutations, and epigenetic changes in ten-eleven-translocation-2 (TET2), additional sex combs like 1 (ASXL1), PcG enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) and DNA methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A). Mutations associated with disease progression such as isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) 1, IDH2, EZH2, serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 2 (SRSF2), p53, casitas B-lineage lymphoma (c-CBL), ikaros zinc fingers (IKZF), neurofibromin 1 (NF1) and runt-related transcription factor 1 (RUNX1) are described. SUMMARY: In this chapter, current knowledge regarding the role of the JAK2V617F mutation on the pathogenesis and disease phenotype of polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia are highlighted.

Nullbasic is a mutant form of the HIV-1 Tat protein that was previously shown to strongly inhibit HIV-1 replication in nonhematopoietic cell lines by targeting three steps of HIV-1 replication: reverse transcription, transport of viral mRNA, and trans-activation of HIV-1 gene expression. Here we investigated gene delivery of Nullbasic, using lentiviral and retroviral vectors. Although Nullbasic could be delivered by lentiviral vectors to target cells, transduction efficiencies were sharply reduced primarily because of negative effects on reverse transcription mediated by Nullbasic. However, Nullbasic did not inhibit transduction of HEK293T cells by a murine leukemia virus (MLV)-based retroviral vector. Therefore, MLV-based virus-like particles were used to transduce and express Nullbasic-EGFP or EGFP in Jurkat cells, a human leukemia T cell line, and Nullbasic-ZsGreen1 or ZsGreen1 in primary human CD4(+) cells.

The median age was 65 years (17-89 years) and median follow-up was 45 months [95% confidence interval (CI) 27-62 months]. TP53 mutations occurred in 30 (9.4%) patients, exclusively in isolated del5q (19%) and complex karyotype (CK) with -5/5q-(72%), correlated with International Prognostic Scoring System intermediate-2/high, TP53 protein expression, higher blast count and leukaemic progression. Patients with mutant TP53 had a paucity of mutations in other genes implicated in myeloid malignancies. Median overall survival of patients with TP53 mutation was shorter than wild-type (9 versus 66 months, P < 0.001) and it retained significance in multivariable model (Hazard Ratio 3.8, 95%CI 2.3-6.3,P < 0.001). None of the sequentially analysed samples showed a disappearance of the mutant clone or emergence of new clones, suggesting an early occurrence of TP53 mutations. A reduction in mutant clone correlated with response to 5-azacitidine, however clones increased in non-responders and persisted at relapse. The adverse impact of TP53 persists after adjustment for cytogenetic risk and is of practical importance in evaluating prognosis. The relatively common occurrence of these mutations in two different prognostic spectrums of MDS, i.e. isolated 5q- and CK with -5/5q-, possibly implies two different mechanistic roles for TP53 protein.","['(c) 2013 Crown copyright.

In the present study, to investigate the effects of radiation on phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-induced megakaryocytic differentiation of K562 cells, the cellular processes responsible for the expression of CD41 antigen (GPIIb/IIIa), which is reported to be expressed early in megakaryocyte maturation, were analyzed. The expression of CD41 antigens was significantly increased 72 h after treatment with both 4 Gy X-irradiation and PMA. In this fraction, two populations, CD41(low) and CD41(high) cells, were detected by flow cytometry. The CD41(high) cells sustained intracellular ROS at the initial level for up to 72 h, but CD41(low) cells had reduced ROS by 48 h. The maximum suppressive effect on CD41 expression was observed when N-acetyl cysteine, which is known to act as a ROS scavenger, was administered 48 h after PMA stimulation. When K562 cells were pretreated with mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway inhibitors, an ERK1/2 inhibitor and a p38 MAPK inhibitor, followed by X-irradiation and PMA stimulation, the reactivity profiles of both inhibitors showed the involvement of MAPK pathway.

Although we understand much about the circadian transcription factors that can switch gene expression on and off, it is still unclear how global changes in rhythmic transcription are controlled at the genomic level. Here, we demonstrate circadian modification of an activating histone mark at a significant proportion of gene loci that undergo daily transcription, implicating widespread epigenetic modification as a key node regulated by the clockwork. Furthermore, we identify the histone-remodelling enzyme mixed lineage leukemia (MLL)3 as a clock-controlled factor that is able to directly and indirectly modulate over a hundred epigenetically targeted circadian ""output"" genes in the liver. Importantly, catalytic inactivation of the histone methyltransferase activity of MLL3 also severely compromises the oscillation of ""core"" clock gene promoters, including Bmal1, mCry1, mPer2, and Rev-erbalpha, suggesting that rhythmic histone methylation is vital for robust transcriptional oscillator function.

Many AML patients are now being treated with hypomethylating agents, such as decitabine (DAC), although the mechanisms by which it induces remissions remain unknown. The goal of this study was to use a novel stromal coculture assay that can expand primary AML cells to identify the immediate changes induced by DAC with a dose (100nM) that decreases total 5-methylcytosine content and reactivates imprinted genes (without causing myeloid differentiation, which would confound downstream genomic analyses). Using array-based technologies, we found that DAC treatment caused global hypomethylation in all samples (with a preference for regions with higher levels of baseline methylation), yet there was limited correlation between changes in methylation and gene expression. Moreover, the patterns of methylation and gene expression across the samples were primarily determined by the intrinsic properties of the primary cells, rather than DAC treatment.

MRD diagnostics performed by real-time quantitative PCR (RQ-PCR) is the gold-standard and currently the most sensitive and the most broadly applied method in follicular lymphoma (FL) and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). RQ-PCR analysis of the junctional regions of the rearranged immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene (IgH) serves as the most broadly applicable MRD target in B-NHL ( approximately 80%). Chromosomal translocations as t(14;18) translocation in FL and t(11;14) translocation in MCL can be used in selected lymphoma subtypes. In patients with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia, both flow-cytometry as well as RQ-PCR are equally suitable for MRD assessment as long as a sensitivity of </=10(-4) shall be achieved.MRD diagnostics targeting the IgH gene is complex and requires extensive knowledge and experience because the junctional regions of each lymphoma have to be identified before the patient-specific RQ-PCR assays can be designed for MRD monitoring. Furthermore, somatic mutations of the IgH region occurring during B-cell development of germinal center and post-germinal center lymphomas may hamper appropriate primer binding leading to false negative results. The translocations mentioned above have the advantage that consensus forward primers and probes, both placed in the breakpoint regions of chromosome 18 in FL and chromosome 11 in MCL, can be used in combination with a reverse primer placed in the IgH joining region of chromosome 14. RQ-PCR-based methods can reach a good sensitivity (</=10(-4)). This chapter provides all relevant background information and technical aspects for the complete laboratory process from detection of the clonal IgH gene rearrangement and the chromosomal translocations at diagnosis to the actual MRD measurements in clinical follow-up samples of B-NHL. However, it should be noted that MRD diagnostics for clinical treatment protocols has to be accompanied by regular international quality control rounds to ensure the reproducibility and reliability of the MRD results.",,"['Pott, Christiane', 'Bruggemann, Monika', 'Ritgen, Matthias', 'van der Velden, Vincent H J', 'van Dongen, Jacques J M', 'Kneba, Michael']","['Pott C', 'Bruggemann M', 'Ritgen M', 'van der Velden VH', 'van Dongen JJ', 'Kneba M']","['Second Department of Medicine, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany. c.pott@med2.uni-kiel.de']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Methods Mol Biol,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",9214969,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)']",IM,,"['Alleles', 'Bone Marrow Cells/pathology', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'Gene Rearrangement/*genetics', 'Heteroduplex Analysis', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*genetics/*pathology', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*diagnosis', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Translocation, Genetic/*genetics']",,,2013/01/09 06:00,2013/06/07 06:00,['2013/01/09 06:00'],"['2013/01/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/01/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/978-1-62703-269-8_10 [doi]'],ppublish,Methods Mol Biol. 2013;971:175-200. doi: 10.1007/978-1-62703-269-8_10.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

BcR stereotypy was initially described in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), where it constitutes a remarkably frequent feature of the IG repertoire, and subsequently identified in other malignancies, including mantle cell lymphoma and splenic marginal-zone lymphoma. Of note, at least in CLL, emerging evidence indicates that the grouping of cases into distinct clusters with stereotyped BcR is functionally and prognostically relevant. Hence, the reliable identification of BcR stereotypy may assist in the investigation of the nature of the selecting antigens and immune pathways leading to lymphoma development, and also potentially pave the way for tailored treatment strategies applicable to each major stereotyped subset.

Transient cerebral ischemia/reperfusion in Mongolian gerbils resulted in delayed neuronal death in hippocampal regions. We examined the antioxidant effects of lycopene because we expected lycopene to attenuate ischemia-related neuronal damage by controlling apoptosis at the gene level. The gerbils were divided into two groups: the normal feeding (control) group that received normal market food (MF) and the lycopene group that received MF containing lycopene (5 mg in 100 g MF food). After 1.5-2.0 months (when body weight were 60-65 g), the lycopene level was 38.2 +/- 17.6 ng/ml in serum and 11.9 +/- 4.0 mug/g-wet weight tissue in the liver. Levels of B cell leukemia-2, an apoptosis-suppressing protein, decreased in control animal brains 1, 3, and 7 days after surgery, whereas the levels increased in lycopene-treated animal brains. Moreover, cysteinyl aspartate-specific protease-3 activity increased gradually after ischemia, but was suppressed in the lycopene-treated animal brains 7 days after surgery. Finally, hippocampal superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity decreased in the control group 3 h after ischemia and, gradually increased thereafter, whereas it was significantly elevated in the lycopene group.

We present a 17.5-year-old girl with DM after high-dose radio- and chemotherapy followed by allogeneic HSCT for the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia, diagnosed when she was 10 years old. In the posttransplantation period, multiple acute and chronic complications occurred. Among them, we observed graft versus host disease requiring corticosteroid therapy, pancreatitis and some endocrine complications like primary hypothyroidism, growth hormone deficiency and hypergonadotropic hypogonadism. DM with some components of metabolic syndrome-like insulin resistance, high arterial blood pressure and dyslipidemia developed during the first year after HSCT. Five years later, a trend towards increased requirement of insulin with deterioration in metabolic control of DM was observed, despite a normal level of C-peptide and negative diabetes autoantibodies. After the addition of metformin to continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion in the therapy of DM, an improvement in metabolic control was observed. Due to the possible mechanism of insulin resistance which is associated with impaired insulin receptors after HSCT procedure, metformin with insulin appears to be effective in the treatment of this type of diabetes.","['Copyright (c) 2013 S.

Two types of CLLs are being distinguished as carrying either unmutated or somatically mutated immunoglobulins (Igs), which are associated with unfavorable and favorable prognoses, respectively. More than 30% of CLLs can be grouped based on their expression of stereotypic B cell receptors (BCRs), strongly suggesting that distinctive antigens are involved in the development of CLL. Unmutated CLLs, carrying Ig heavy chain variable (IGHV) genes in germline configuration, express low-affinity, poly-, and self-reactive BCRs. However, the antigenic specificity of CLLs with mutated IGHV-genes (M-CLL) remained elusive. In this study, we describe a new subset of M-CLL, expressing stereotypic BCRs highly specific for beta-(1,6)-glucan, a major antigenic determinant of yeasts and filamentous fungi. beta-(1,6)-glucan binding depended on both the stereotypic Ig heavy and light chains, as well as on a distinct amino acid in the IGHV-CDR3. Reversion of IGHV mutations to germline configuration reduced the affinity for beta-(1,6)-glucan, indicating that these BCRs are indeed affinity-selected for their cognate antigen. Moreover, CLL cells expressing these stereotypic receptors proliferate in response to beta-(1,6)-glucan.

We unravel CD98hc functions in vivo in skin. We report that CD98hc invalidation has no appreciable effect on cell adhesion, clearly showing that CD98hc disruption phenocopies neither CD98hc knockdown in cultured keratinocytes nor epidermal beta1 integrin loss in vivo. Instead, we show that CD98hc deletion in murine epidermis results in improper skin homeostasis and epidermal wound healing. These defects resemble aged skin alterations and correlate with reduction of CD98hc expression observed in elderly mice. We also demonstrate that CD98hc absence in vivo induces defects as early as integrin-dependent Src activation. We decipher the molecular mechanisms involved in vivo by revealing a crucial role of the CD98hc/integrins/Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) leukemia-associated RhoGEF (LARG)/RhoA pathway in skin homeostasis.

Due to the rarity of monomorphic T-cell PTLD (T-PTLD), knowledge about pathogenesis, risk factors, therapy, and prognosis relies predominantly on case reports and small series. Therefore, we aimed to provide an overview and a retrospective analysis of this rare PTLD subtype. METHODS: We analyzed all available articles on T-PTLD in the PubMed database as well as in our own databases (Institute of Pathology/Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, Hannover Medical School) from 1988 to 2010. Reevaluated parameters were gender, age, transplanted organ, immunosuppressant regimen, time between transplantation and T-PTLD manifestation, T-PTLD subtype, virus positivity, localization, therapy, and follow-up. RESULTS: A total of 163 cases were evaluated. We found that hematopoietic stem cell transplantation was associated with early-onset T-PTLD, whereas late onset occurred after immunosuppression with steroids and azathioprine without administration of calcineurin inhibitors. The major independent favorable prognostic factors were T-PTLD of the large granular lymphocytic leukemia subtype, young age, and a combination of radiotherapy/radiochemotherapy and reduced immunosuppression, whereas the hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma subtype and cases with involvement of bone marrow, the central nervous system, or graft had an adverse prognosis. CONCLUSION: T-PTLD is a heterogeneous group of different aberrant T-cell proliferations and represents a significant complication following transplantation, showing a uniformly poor prognosis.",,"['Tiede, Christina', 'Maecker-Kolhoff, Britta', 'Klein, Christoph', 'Kreipe, Hans', 'Hussein, Kais']","['Tiede C', 'Maecker-Kolhoff B', 'Klein C', 'Kreipe H', 'Hussein K']","['Institute of Pathology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Transplantation,Transplantation,0132144,,IM,,"['Adult', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Comorbidity', 'Epstein-Barr Virus Infections/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Kidney Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/*diagnosis/*epidemiology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Postoperative Period', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'T-Lymphocytes/*pathology']",,,2013/01/09 06:00,2013/06/21 06:00,['2013/01/09 06:00'],"['2013/01/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/01/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/TP.0b013e3182762e07 [doi]'],ppublish,Transplantation. 2013 Feb 15;95(3):479-88. doi: 10.1097/TP.0b013e3182762e07.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our results show that the seven most informative marker genes on the chip resulted in fingerprints that correctly predicted the (anti-)estrogenic activity of the model compounds except that of the negative control testosterone. Two marker genes, myeloid leukemia factor-1 interacting protein and ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2C, were even capable of correctly predicting the estrogenic potency of all five estrogen receptor (ER) agonists tested and correlated well with the potencies as determined in the MCF-7/BOS proliferation assay and the in vivo uterotrophic assay. In addition, it was demonstrated that the estrogenic responses of testosterone, both in the array tube assay and in the proliferation assay, were partially due to the conversion of testosterone into 17beta-estradiol by aromatase but also due to formation of other estrogenic metabolites, the presence and estrogenic potency of which were confirmed by gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis and a yeast-based reporter gene assay, respectively. It is concluded that low-density DNA microchip-based fingerprinting in MCF-7/BOS cells for estrogenicity marker genes provides a faster in vitro alternative to the current MCF-7/BOS cell proliferation assay (E-screen).",['Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Therefore, we developed an approach to propagate polyclonal gammadelta T cells and rendered them bispecific through expression of a CD19-specific chimeric antigen receptor (CAR). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were electroporated with Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposon and transposase to enforce expression of CAR in multiple gammadelta T-cell subsets.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with HL treated at Stanford with at least 5 years of follow-up after completing therapy were identified from our database. Records were reviewed for outcome and development of t-AML/MDS. RESULTS: Seven hundred fifty-four patients treated from 1974 to 2003 were identified. Therapy varied across studies. Radiotherapy evolved from extended fields (S and C studies) to involved fields (G studies). Primary chemotherapy was mechlorethamine, vincristine, procarbazine, and prednisone (MOPP) or procarbazine, mechlorethamine, and vinblastine (PAVe) in S studies; MOPP, PAVe, vinblastine, bleomycin, and methotrexate (VBM), or doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (ABVD) in C studies; and VbM (reduced dose of bleomycin compared with VBM) or mechlorethamine, doxorubicin, vinblastine, vincristine, bleomycin, etoposide, and prednisone (Stanford V) in G studies. Cumulative exposure to alkylating agent (AA) was notably lower in the G studies compared with the S and C studies, with a 75% to 83% lower dose of nitrogen mustard in addition to omission of procarbazine and melphalan. Twenty-four (3.2%) of 754 patients developed t-AML/MDS, 15 after primary chemotherapy and nine after salvage chemotherapy for relapsed HL. The incidence of t-AML/MDS was significantly lower in the G studies (0.3%) compared with the S (5.7%) or C (5.2%) studies (P < .001). Additionally, in the G studies, no t-AML/MDS was noted after primary therapy, and the only patient who developed t-AML/MDS did so after second-line therapy. CONCLUSION: Our data demonstrate the relationship between the cumulative AA dose and t-AML/MDS. Limiting the dose of AA and decreased need for secondary treatments have significantly reduced the incidence of t-AML/MDS, which was extremely rare in the G studies (Stanford V era).",,"['Koontz, Michael Zach', 'Horning, Sandra J', 'Balise, Raymond', 'Greenberg, Peter L', 'Rosenberg, Saul A', 'Hoppe, Richard T', 'Advani, Ranjana H']","['Koontz MZ', 'Horning SJ', 'Balise R', 'Greenberg PL', 'Rosenberg SA', 'Hoppe RT', 'Advani RH']","['Stanford University Medical Center, 875 Blake Wilbur Dr, CC-2338, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.']",['eng'],"['P01 CA034233/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA34233/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA21555/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA009287/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA56060/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA09287/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA05838/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA056060/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20130107,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['11056-06-7 (Bleomycin)', '35S93Y190K (Procarbazine)', '50D9XSG0VR (Mechlorethamine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', '7GR28W0FJI (Dacarbazine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'Q41OR9510P (Melphalan)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)', 'ABVD protocol', 'MOPP protocol', 'PAVe protocol 1', 'VBM protocol']",IM,,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Bleomycin/adverse effects', 'California/epidemiology', 'Chemotherapy, Adjuvant/adverse effects', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Dacarbazine/adverse effects', 'Databases, Factual', 'Doxorubicin/adverse effects', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Hodgkin Disease/*drug therapy/pathology/*radiotherapy', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Male', 'Mechlorethamine/adverse effects', 'Melphalan/adverse effects', 'Methotrexate/adverse effects', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Prednisone/adverse effects', 'Procarbazine/adverse effects', 'Radiotherapy Dosage', 'Radiotherapy, Adjuvant/adverse effects', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Vinblastine/adverse effects', 'Vincristine/adverse effects']",PMC3565182,,2013/01/09 06:00,2013/03/30 06:00,['2013/01/09 06:00'],"['2013/01/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/01/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/30 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2012.44.5791 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2012.44.5791 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2013 Feb 10;31(5):592-8. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2012.44.5791.

U-2932 populations were traced to subclones of the original tumor with clone-specific immunoglobulin IgVH4-39 hypermutation patterns. BCL6 was overexpressed in one subpopulation (R1), MYC in the other (R2), both clones overexpressed BCL2. According to the combined results of immunoglobulin hypermutation and cytogenetic analysis, R1 and R2 derive from a mother clone with genomic BCL2 amplification, which acquired secondary rearrangements leading to the overexpression of BCL6 (R1) or MYC (R2). Some 200 genes were differentially expressed in R1/R2 microarrays including transcriptional targets of the aberrantly expressed oncogenes. Other genes were regulated by epigenetic means as shown by DNA methylation analysis.

To analyze biological features and clinical impact of NOTCH1 mutations in CLL, we sequenced this gene in 565 patients. NOTCH1 mutations, found in 63 patients (11%), were associated with unmutated IGHV, high expression of CD38 and ZAP-70, trisomy 12, advanced stage and elevated lactate dehydrogenase. Sequential analysis in 200 patients demonstrated acquisition of mutation in one case (0.5%) and disappearance after treatment in two. Binet A and B patients with NOTCH1-mutated had a shorter time to treatment. NOTCH1-mutated patients were more frequently refractory to therapy and showed shorter progression-free and overall survival after complete remission. Overall survival was shorter in NOTCH1-mutated patients, although not independently from IGHV.

There are few reports that have examined the correlation between pre-HSCT chemotherapeutic exposure and DAH. OBJECTIVES: We examine the role of pre-HSCT chemotherapeutic exposure, conditioning regimens, pre-HSCT comorbidities and transplant-related complications in the development of DAH after allo-HSCT and evaluate the effect of the high-dose corticosteroid strategy on DAH. METHODS: A retrospective nested case-control study was designed. Cases with DAH and controls matched for year of allo-HSCT and length of follow-up were identified from a cohort of 597 patients who underwent allo-HSCT between 2006 and 2011 for acute leukemia. RESULTS: Twenty-two patients suffered from DAH; the mean age at the time of presentation was 30.4 years (+/-12.9) and the mean time to presentation was 7.8 months (+/-8.1) post-HSCT. The pre-HSCT cyclophosphamide exposure and the cumulative cyclophosphamide dose were significantly higher among the DAH cases compared with the controls, and the cumulative cyclophosphamide dose of >/=5 g/m(2) was independently associated with DAH (OR = 3.4, p = 0.030). High-dose corticosteroid treatment did not significantly improve survival. CONCLUSIONS: From these results we can identify patients who are at a higher risk of developing DAH after allo-HSCT, and we found that high-dose corticosteroid therapy may not alter the poor outcome associated with this syndrome.","['Copyright (c) 2012 S.

Regardless of implantation site, all grafts (n = 10) deposited in immunodeficient animals revealed excellent survival. In contrast, immunocompetent animals only accepted grafts at the STR site (n = 10), whereas all the FM grafts were rejected (n = 10). To investigate the factors that led to rejection of FM grafts, with acceptance of STR grafts, another group of animals (n = 19) was sacrificed during the prerejection period, on day 5. Near-infrared fluorescence imaging with IRDye 800CW-polyethylene glycol probe displayed similar blood-brain barrier disruption at both graft locations. The morphological distribution of FM grafts was cylindrical, parallel to the needle track, whereas cells transplanted into the STR accumulated along the border between the STR and the corpus callosum. There was significantly less infiltration by both innate and adaptive immune cells in the STR grafts, especially along the calloso-striatal border.

In the present study, we prospectively evaluated the efficacy and safety of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) expanded from the bone marrow of a third-party donor to patients with PGF after allo-HSCT. Twenty patients with PGF (7 with primary and 13 with secondary PGF) received MSCs (1 x 10(6)/kg) one to three times at 28-day intervals. Seventeen patients were responsive to MSCs, whereas three were not. Within the first 100 days after MSC treatment, 13 patients developed 20 episodes of infection. Moreover, five patients experienced cytomegalovirus-DNA viremia, and seven experienced Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-DNA viremia within the first 100 days after MSC treatment; three of the latter developed EBV-associated posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLD) within the follow-up period. Grade II acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) occurred in one patient, and local chronic GVHD occurred in two patients after receiving MSC treatment, including one acute GVHD and one chronic GVHD, respectively, after accepting donor lymphocyte infusions due to PTLD. After a follow-up period of an average of 508 days (range 166-904 days) posttransplantation, 11 patients died. No short-term toxic side effects were observed after MSC treatment.

However, prognosis of adult patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (Ph(+) ALL) still remains poor. Because most adults eventually relapse without allogeneic stem cell transplantation, which is not available for all patients, novel strategies are required for relapse prevention. As the integrity of the immune system is essential for the control of remaining leukaemia cells, we compared the efficacy of anthocyanins, imatinib and a DNA-based vaccine as non-immunosuppressant components with 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) to control minimal residual disease in vitro and in vivo using different leukaemia cell lines and syngeneic mice. Proliferation of Ph(+) ALL was significantly better inhibited by anthocyanin-rich berry extract or imatinib compared with 6-MP. Although anthocyanins induced apoptosis in some leukaemia cell lines, the level of caspase-3, caspase-8 and caspase-9 was significantly lower compared with imatinib and 6-MP. When used as single components, anthocyanins and imatinib mesylate failed to eradicate pre-existing Ph(+) ALL in syngeneic mice, while 6-MP led to 10% and DNA vaccination to 56% survival. Intriguingly, only the combination of DNA vaccination with berry extract but not with the isolated anthocyanin, cyanidin-3-rutinoside or imatinib further increased leukaemia-free and overall survival, and 90% of lethally challenged mice survived. We suggest that induction and enhancement of a leukaemia-specific immunity by DNA vaccination and anthocyanin-rich berry extract can also decrease the relapse rate in patients with Ph(+) ALL. Furthermore, this approach may serve as strategy for maintenance therapy of other malignancies.",['(c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons A/S.'],"['Kochling, Joachim', 'Schmidt, Manuel', 'Rott, Yvonne', 'Sagner, Michael', 'Ungefroren, Hendrik', 'Wittig, Burghard', 'Henze, Gunter']","['Kochling J', 'Schmidt M', 'Rott Y', 'Sagner M', 'Ungefroren H', 'Wittig B', 'Henze G']","['Department of Paediatrics, UKSH, Campus Lubeck, Universitat zu Lubeck, Ratzeburger Allee 160, Lubeck, Germany. koechling.luebeck@freenet.de']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130219,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Anthocyanins)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Vaccines, DNA)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Anthocyanins/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzamides/therapeutic use', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'K562 Cells', 'Maintenance Chemotherapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Piperazines/therapeutic use', 'Plant Extracts/therapeutic use', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use', 'Vaccines, DNA/therapeutic use']",,,2013/01/09 06:00,2013/05/08 06:00,['2013/01/09 06:00'],"['2013/01/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/01/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/01/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/ejh.12071 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2013 Apr;90(4):291-300. doi: 10.1111/ejh.12071.

While most patients achieve remission, approximately half of patients recur with a short latency to relapse. This suggests that chemotherapy-resistant leukaemia stem cells (LSCs) survive and can recapitulate the leukaemia. We hypothesized that interactions between LSCs and the bone marrow microenvironment mediate survival and chemotherapy resistance in MLL-R ALL. Using primary samples of infant MLL-R ALL, we studied the influence of bone marrow stroma on apoptosis, proliferation, and cytotoxicity induced by the FLT3 inhibitor lestaurtinib. MLL-R ALL were differentially protected by stroma from spontaneous apoptosis compared to non-MLL-R ALL. Co-culture of bulk MLL-R ALL in direct contact with stroma or with stroma-produced soluble factors promoted proliferation and cell cycle entry. Stroma also protected bulk MLL-R ALL cells and MLL-R ALL LSCs from lestaurtinib-mediated cytotoxicity. Previous studies have demonstrated that CXCR4 mediates bone marrow microenvironment signalling. Using a xenograft model of MLL-R ALL, we demonstrated that CXCR4 inhibition with AMD3100 (plerixafor) led to markedly enhanced efficacy of lestaurtinib. Therefore, the bone marrow microenvironment is a mediator of chemotherapy resistance in MLL-R ALL and targeting leukaemia-stroma interactions with CXCR4 inhibitors may prove useful in this high-risk subtype of paediatric ALL.",['(c) 2013 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.'],"['Sison, Edward Allan R', 'Rau, Rachel E', 'McIntyre, Emily', 'Li, Li', 'Small, Donald', 'Brown, Patrick']","['Sison EA', 'Rau RE', 'McIntyre E', 'Li L', 'Small D', 'Brown P']","['Oncology and Pediatrics, The Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.']",['eng'],['P30 CA006973/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130107,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (CXCR4 protein, human)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*pathology', 'Cell Communication/*physiology', 'Cell Growth Processes/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/*pathology/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Receptors, CXCR4/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Stromal Cells/*pathology', 'Survival Analysis', 'Tumor Microenvironment', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC4005340,['NIHMS568492'],2013/01/09 06:00,2013/07/24 06:00,['2013/01/09 06:00'],"['2012/10/01 00:00 [received]', '2012/11/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/01/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/01/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/bjh.12205 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2013 Mar;160(6):785-97. doi: 10.1111/bjh.12205.

Here we comprehensively review the signaling pathways and enzymes that modify PML and also the oncogenic PML-RARalpha fusion protein. Many PTMs occur in a hierarchical and timely organized fashion. Phosphorylation or acetylation constitutes typical starting points for many PML modifying events, while degradative ubiquitination is an irreversible end point of the modification cascade.

The role of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway and intracellular factors in regulation of neutrophil apoptosis remain incompletely understood. We previously reported that the nuclear factor MNDA (myeloid nuclear differentiation antigen) is fundamental to execution of the constitutive neutrophil death program. During neutrophil apoptosis MNDA is cleaved by caspases and relocated to the cytoplasm. However, when challenged with known mediators of sepsis, human neutrophils of healthy donors or neutrophils from patients with sepsis exhibited impaired MNDA relocation/cleavage parallel with myeloid cell leukemia-1 (MCL-1) accumulation and suppression of apoptosis. MNDA knockdown in a model cell line indicated that upon induction of apoptosis, MNDA promotes proteasomal degradation of MCL-1, thereby aggravating mitochondrial dysfunction. Thus, MNDA is central to a novel nucleus-mitochondrion circuit that promotes progression of apoptosis.

SUMMARY ANSWER: Several miRNAs are aberrantly expressed in endometriotic cyst stromal cells (ECSCs), including miR-196b whose expression is repressed in endometriotic stromal cells. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Although, histologically, endometriotic tissues and normal proliferative endometrium are similar, a number of distinct molecular differences have been reported to date. The anti-apoptotic and excessive proliferative properties of endometriotic cells are considered to be involved in the development and progression of endometriosis. STUDY DESIGN AND SIZE DURATION: ECSCs and normal endometrial stromal cells (NESCs) were isolated from ovarian endometriotic tissues and eutopic endometrial tissues, respectively and compared. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING AND METHODS: Aberrantly expressed miRNAs in ECSCs were identified by a global miRNA microarray technique. The roles of miR-196b in ECSC proliferation, apoptosis, and c-myc and B-cell lymphoma/leukemia (Bcl)-2 mRNA expression were investigated with precursor hsa-miR-196b transfection. The methylation status of the miR-196b gene in ECSCs and the effect of a DNA demethylating agent on miR-196b expression were also examined. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: miRNA microarray analysis identified eight down-regulated miRNAs (including miR-196b) and four up-regulated miRNAs in ECSCs. Compulsory expression of miR-196b directed the inhibition of proliferation and the induction of apoptosis in ECSCs. miR-196b was found to suppress c-myc and Bcl-2 mRNA expression in ECSCs, and there was a significant correlation between miR-196b and HOXA10 expression in ECSCs and NESCs. The miR-196b gene was hypermethylated in ECSCs when compared with NESCs, and the treatment with a DNA demethylating agent restored the expression of miR-196b in ECSCs. LIMITATIONS AND REASONS FOR CAUTION: miRNA expression profiles were investigated only in the stromal component of ectopic and eutopic endometrium samples. In addition to miR-196b, the roles of other miRNAs aberrantly expressed in ECSCs should be examined. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: The present findings suggest that aberrant miRNA expression plays an important role in the pathogenesis of endometriosis as a part of epigenetic mechanisms, that expression of miR-196b in ECSCs is repressed by DNA hypermethylation of the miR-196b gene and this repression may be involved in the development of proliferative and anti-apoptotic characteristics of endometriosis.

A small proportion of patients with APL have complex or simple variants of this translocation. With conventional cytogenetic methods, these translocations are detected in about 70-90 % of patients, with most of the negative results due to technical problems or cryptic variants. Those masked PML/RARA fusions can be identified by molecular analyses such as reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). We report the case of a 58-year-old man showing morphological, cytochemical, and immunophenotypic features of hypergranular APL (FAB-M4). PML-RARA transcripts were not evident on RT-PCR. Although cytogenetic tests revealed the presence of an apparently balanced translocation t(15;17)(q24;q11) with an abnormal chromosome 12 that characterized a M3 leukemia. This karyotypic interpretation was confirmed by FISH with the use of painting probes of chromosomes 12, 15, and 17 and a PML-RARA dual-color DNA probe. FISH showed a PML-RARA fusion gene on the der(12) instead of the der(15). The patient was treated with an all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) plus anthracycline-based protocol and achieved complete remission, with no recurrence to date.

We performed a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy of selenium on the prevention of OM in 77 patients with leukemia, undergoing allogeneic HSCT. Thirty-seven patients received oral selenium tablets (200 mcg twice daily) from the starting day of HDC to 14 days after transplantation. OM was evaluated daily for 21 days after transplantation according to World Health Organization oral toxicity scale. The incidence of severe OM (grades 3-4) was significantly lower in the selenium group (10.8% vs 35.1%, P<0.05). We noted that the duration of objective OM (grades 2-4), excluding patient's self-declaration (grade 1), was significantly shorter in the selenium group (3.6+/-1.84 vs 5.3+/-2.2 days, P=0.014). Significant elevations in serum selenium level and plasma Glu.Px activity were observed 7 and 14 days after transplantation compared with baseline in the selenium group.

One means to counter this is to selectively deliver the drug to the cancer cell. Cancer cells accumulate increased concentrations of polyamines compared to normal cells, mainly through an increased uptake of preformed polyamines via the polyamine transport system (PTS). Furthermore, the non-stringent structural requirements of the PTS enable the transport of a range of polyamine-based molecules. Thus, the PTS can be used to transport compounds linked to polyamines selectively to cancer cells. In our laboratory, polyamine-anthracene conjugates have shown potent anti-tumour activity towards HL-60 cells. The aim of this study was to determine the cytotoxicity of Ant-4,4, a homospermidine-anthracene conjugate, and assess the long-term effects by determining whether cancer cells were able to recover from treatment. During exposure, Ant-4,4 was an effective growth-inhibitory agent in HL-60 cells decreasing viable cell number, protein and polyamine content. Evidence indicates concomitant cell-cycle arrest and increased apoptosis. Once the drug was removed, HL-60 cells recovered gradually over time. Increasing cell number, protein content and polyamine content, as well as diminished effects on cell-cycle and apoptotic stimuli were observed over time. These data suggest that, despite being an effective way of delivering anthracene, these polyamine conjugates do not exert long-lasting effects on HL-60 cells.",,"['Traquete, Rui', 'Ghani, Radiah A', 'Phanstiel, Otto', 'Wallace, Heather M']","['Traquete R', 'Ghani RA', 'Phanstiel O', 'Wallace HM']","['Division of Applied Medicine, School of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Aberdeen, Polwarth Building, Foresterhill, Aberdeen, AB25 2ZD, Scotland, UK. rui.traquete.10@aberdeen.ac.uk']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130106,Austria,Amino Acids,Amino acids,9200312,"['0 (Anthracenes)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Polyamines)', 'EH46A1TLD7 (anthracene)']",IM,,"['Anthracenes/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/metabolism/*physiopathology', 'Polyamines/chemistry/*metabolism/pharmacology']",,,2013/01/08 06:00,2013/08/29 06:00,['2013/01/08 06:00'],"['2012/11/14 00:00 [received]', '2012/12/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/01/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/01/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00726-012-1452-2 [doi]'],ppublish,Amino Acids. 2013 Apr;44(4):1193-203. doi: 10.1007/s00726-012-1452-2.

Although the treatment outcome is dramatically improved by all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), life-threatening bleeding from enhanced fibrinolytic-type disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) remains a serious clinical problem, and a standard treatment has not been established. However, recent reports indicate that recombinant human soluble thrombomodulin (rTM) is effective against DIC. METHODS: To elucidate the clinical characteristics and outcomes of DIC resulting from APL, we retrospectively analyzed 10 patients with DIC resulting from APL at our institution over a six year period. Of the 10 patients, four were treated with serine protease inhibitors (SPI) and six were treated with rTM. The diagnosis of DIC was based on the diagnostic criteria of the Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare. In addition to treating APL with ATRA, rTM was administered for six consecutive days. RESULTS: The DIC was resolved within seven days after initiating treatment in 25.0% (1/4) of the patients in the SPI group and 66.6% (4/6) of the patients in the rTM group. Although the rTM group consisted of patients with life-threatening bleeding who required RCC transfusion, a prompt resolution rate and reduced DIC score without progression of bleeding was achieved in this group. All patients were alive after the 28-day observation period. CONCLUSION: Based on the present findings, rTM administration may be an effective, safe, and feasible therapeutic modality, producing a rapid resolution without progression of hemorrahage.",,"['Kawano, Noriaki', 'Kuriyama, Takuro', 'Yoshida, Shuro', 'Yamashita, Kiyoshi', 'Ochiai, Hidenobu', 'Nakazaki, Shuji', 'Tasaki, Akira', 'Ueda, Akira']","['Kawano N', 'Kuriyama T', 'Yoshida S', 'Yamashita K', 'Ochiai H', 'Nakazaki S', 'Tasaki A', 'Ueda A']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Miyazaki Prefectural Miyazaki Hospital, Japan. kawanoriaki@yahoo.co.jp']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20130101,Japan,Intern Med,"Internal medicine (Tokyo, Japan)",9204241,['0 (Thrombomodulin)'],IM,,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Blood Chemical Analysis', 'Cohort Studies', 'Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation/*drug therapy/*etiology/physiopathology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*complications/diagnosis/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Assessment', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Sex Factors', 'Thrombomodulin/*administration & dosage', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2013/01/08 06:00,2013/07/26 06:00,['2013/01/08 06:00'],"['2013/01/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/01/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/26 06:00 [medline]']","['DN/JST.JSTAGE/internalmedicine/52.7978 [pii]', '10.2169/internalmedicine.52.7978 [doi]']",ppublish,Intern Med. 2013;52(1):55-62. doi: 10.2169/internalmedicine.52.7978.

This family comprises proapoptotic and prosurvival proteins, and shifting the balance toward the latter is an established mechanism whereby cancer cells evade apoptosis. The therapeutic potential of directly inhibiting prosurvival proteins was unveiled with the development of navitoclax, a selective inhibitor of both BCL-2 and BCL-2-like 1 (BCL-X(L)), which has shown clinical efficacy in some BCL-2-dependent hematological cancers. However, concomitant on-target thrombocytopenia caused by BCL-X(L) inhibition limits the efficacy achievable with this agent. Here we report the re-engineering of navitoclax to create a highly potent, orally bioavailable and BCL-2-selective inhibitor, ABT-199. This compound inhibits the growth of BCL-2-dependent tumors in vivo and spares human platelets. A single dose of ABT-199 in three patients with refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia resulted in tumor lysis within 24 h.

Additionally, short-term delivery of LIF has been shown to have preconditioning effects on the heart and to limit infarct size. However, cell culture studies have suggested that LIF may exert harmful effects on cardiac myocytes, including pathological hypertrophy and contractile dysfunction. Long-term effects of LIF on the heart in vivo have not been reported and were the focus of this study. Adult male mice were injected daily with LIF (2 mug/30 g) or saline for 10 days. LIF treatment caused an approximate 11% loss in body weight. Cardiac function as assessed by echocardiography was improved in LIF-treated mice. Ejection fraction and fractional shortening were increased by 21% and 32%, respectively. No cardiac hypertrophy was seen on histology in LIF-treated mice,, there was no change in the heart-to-tibia length ratio, and no cardiac fibrosis was observed. STAT3 was markedly activated by LIF in the left ventricle. Different effects of LIF were seen in protein levels of genes associated with STAT3 in the left ventricle: levels of SOD2 and Bcl-xL were unchanged, but levels of total STAT3 and MCP-1 were increased. There was a trend towards increased expression of miR-17, miR-21, and miR-199 in the left ventricle of LIF-treated mice, but these changes were not statistically significant. In conclusion, effects of chronic LIF treatment on the heart, although modest, were positive for systolic function: adverse cardiac remodeling was not observed.

We used Zinc Finger Nucleases (ZFNs) to introduce precise cuts within MLL to examine how a single DNA DSB might lead to chromosomal rearrangements. A ZFN targeting exon 13 within the Breakpoint Cluster Region of MLL was transiently expressed in a human lymphoblast cell line originating from a CML patient. Although FISH analysis showed ZFN DSB at this region increased the rate of MLL fragmentation, we were unable to detect leukemogenic rearrangements or translocations via inverse PCR. Interestingly, gene fragmentation as well as small interstitial deletions, insertions and base substitutions increased with the inhibition of DNA-PK, suggesting repair of this particular DSB is linked to non-homologous end joining (NHEJ).

Phagocytes are thus prime therapeutic targets to control inflammatory events associated to ROS production. Nowadays, there is a growing interest for the use of polyphenols to modulate the inflammatory response. The aim of this work was to study the antioxidant effect of NDS27, a highly water-soluble form of the polyphenolic molecule curcumin, on in vitro stimulated equine PMNs and human promyelocytic leukemia cells (HL-60). NDS27 was either pre-incubated with cells and eliminated before their activation (intracellular effect) or let in the medium (extracellular effect). Our results indicate that NDS27 significantly and dose-dependently (10(-6) M-10(-4) M) inhibited the ROS production in both cell types without affecting their viability. NDS27 was able to cross and interact with cell membrane, especially for HL-60 cells, while we observed a better intracellular antioxidant effect with PMNs. The activity of myeloperoxidase (MPO) released by PMNs and HL-60 cells, was decreased by NDS27, but more efficiently for PMNs. These results suggested that the greater efficiency of NDS27 in PMNs is due to an inhibitory effect on cells which are more mature for ROS production, probably by targeting the enzymes implied in respiratory burst like MPO.

METHODS: Totally 32 AML-CR1 patients underwent allo-HSCT were divided into Bu/Cy (Bu 3.2 mgxkg(-1)xd(-1), 7 - 4 days before transplantation; Cy 60 mgxkg(-1)xd(-1), 3 - 2 days before transplantation) and Bu/Flu (Bu 3.2 mgxkg(-1)xd(-1), 5 - 2 days before transplantation; Flu 30 mgxm(-2)xd(-1), 6 - 2 days before transplantation) groups. The regimen-related toxicity (RRT), incidence and severity of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), 3-year cumulative relapse rate, non-relapse mortality (NRM), 3-year event-free survival (EFS) rate and overall survival (OS) rate were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: The median follow-up duration was 617.5 (6 - 1261) days. All patients achieved successful engraftment on 30 day after transplantation. There were no significant differences in the median time to neutrophil engraftment (P = 0.121) and platelet engraftment (P = 0.171) between the two groups. The median duration of neutrophil count under 0.1x10(9)/L and platelet count under 20x10(9)/L in the Bu/Cy group were significantly longer than those in the Bu/Flu group (P = 0.000 and P = 0.047). The incidence of grades II-IV RRT were 68.8% and 25.0% (P = 0.032) in the Bu/Cy and the Bu/Flu groups, respectively. There were no significant differences in the incidence of acute GVHD (P = 0.149), chronic GVHD (P = 0.149), incidence of NRM (P = 0.333), 3-year cumulative relapse rates (P = 0.834), 3-year EFS rate (P = 0.362) and OS rate (P = 0.111) between the two groups.

In this study, ultrasound and microbubbles (USMBs) were used to enhance intracellular uptake of GNRs. AML-5 cells in suspension (0.6 mL) were exposed to ultrasound (1.3 and 1.7 MPa peak negative pressure) and definity microbubbles (1.7% v/v) for 1 min at varying GNR concentrations (0-2.5x10(11) per mL). Following ultrasound-microbubble treatment, cells were centrifuged twice and treated with an 810 nm laser at an average fluence rate of 3.6 W/cm(2) for 5 min. In addition, cells were incubated with GNRs for 12 h prior to laser treatment. Following the treatment, cell viability (V(PI)) was assessed using propidium iodide (PI) and flow cytometry. Cell viability decreased by approximately 4-folds with the combined treatment of USMB+GNR+Laser (V(PI)=17%) compared to cells incubated with GNR+Laser (V(PI)=68%). This effect depended on ultrasound pressure and GNR concentration. Higher cell death was achieved at higher GNR concentration and 1.3 MPa peak negative pressure.

This glycosylation by GCS is a critical step regulating the modulation of cellular activities by controlling ceramide and glycosphingolipids (GSLs). An increase of ceramide in response to stresses, such as chemotherapy, drives cells to proliferation arrest and apoptosis or autophagy; however, ceramide glycosylation promptly eliminates ceramide and consequently, these induced processes, thus protecting cancer cells. Further, persistently enhanced ceramide glycosylation can increase GSLs, participating in selecting cancer cells to drug resistance. GCS is overexpressed in diverse drug-resistant cancer cells and in tumors of breast, colon, and leukemia that display poor response to chemotherapy. As ceramide glycosylation by GCS is a rate-limiting step in GSL synthesis, inhibition of GCS sensitizes cancer cells to anticancer drugs and eradicates cancer stem cells. Mechanistic studies indicate that uncoupling ceramide glycosylation can modulate gene expression, decreasing MDR1 through the cSrc/beta-catenin pathway and restoring p53 expression via RNA splicing.

Reports on mice and human mGSC have demonstrated that mGSC are an unlimited resource of pluripotent stem cells for sperm production. The conditions of isolation and culture of mouse and human mGSC are well developed; however, the systematic culture conditions of dairy goat mGSC are still deficient although there have been several reports of successful cultures. With the present research, several key elements of isolation and culture of dairy goat mGSC have been determined. Details for the conditions of isolation of dairy testicular spermatogonium cells were optimized, and effects of several extracellular matrix types, ages of dairy goat, and cytokines on enrichment and culture of mGSC were compared. Biological characteristics of the cells were also evaluated by RT-PCR and immunofluorescent staining. The results indicated there is one kind of enzyme cocktail (CTHD (1mg/ml collagenase, 10mug/ml DNase, 1mg/ml hyaluronidase and 1mg/ml trypsin) combined TD (0.25% trypsin and 10mg/ml DNaseI)) that can be used to successfully isolate dairy goat testicular spermatogonium cells efficiently; and fibronectin as well as laminin were efficient extracellular matrix to enrich mGSC among the extracellular matrix types evaluated. Age of dairy goat clearly influenced the cultures of dairy goat mGSC with the efficiency of establishment of an mGSC line being greater if the age of the dairy goat is younger. Some cytokines e.g. BIO (A GSK3 inhibitor, 6-bromoindirubin-3'-oxime) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) acted positively on the maintenance of proliferation and pluripotency of mGSC.

Deregulation of TGF-beta signaling is associated with the development of many cancers, including leukemia, though the molecular mechanisms are largely unclear. Here, we show that Casitas B-lineage lymphoma (c-Cbl), a known proto-oncogene encoding an ubiquitin E3 ligase, promotes TGF-beta signaling by neddylating and stabilizing the type II receptor (TbetaRII). Knockout of c-Cbl decreases the TbetaRII protein level and desensitizes hematopoietic stem or progenitor cells to TGF-beta stimulation, while c-Cbl overexpression stabilizes TbetaRII and sensitizes leukemia cells to TGF-beta. c-Cbl conjugates neural precursor cell-expressed, developmentally downregulated 8 (NEDD8), a ubiquitin-like protein, to TbetaRII at Lys556 and Lys567. Neddylation of TbetaRII promotes its endocytosis to EEA1-positive early endosomes while preventing its endocytosis to caveolin-positive compartments, therefore inhibiting TbetaRII ubiquitination and degradation.

In this study, we examined whether MuLV-ERVs' response to burn-elicited stressors is specific for certain lymphocyte populations and/or locations of lymphoid organ. RESULTS: B- and T-cells, which were sorted from nine lymphoid organs of C57BL/6J mice after burn, were subjected to MuLV-ERV expression analyses. Overall, the post-burn MuLV-ERV expression pattern was dependent on lymphocyte type, time after injury, location of lymphoid organ, and MuLV-ERV type. For instance, the MuLV-ERV expression in T-cells from the thymus and three cervical lymph nodes decreased at 3 hours post-burn while the expression of some MuLV-ERVs was augmented in B-cells derived from the mesenteric lymph node. The MuLV-ERV U3 sequences population of the burn-24 hours group was less diverse in comparison to the no burn and burn-3 hours groups. In addition, it was apparent that at the 24 hours time point, the U3 populations of B-cells from both no burn and burn groups were less heterogeneous than the T-cells' U3 populations. Using the U3 sequences, some of which were isolated only from specific experimental groups (B- vs. T-cells; no burn vs. burn), as probes, 51 putative MuLV-ERVs, including 16 full-length proviruses, were mapped followed by characterization of their biologic properties. CONCLUSION: MuLV-ERVs' response to burn-elicited stressors may be differentially controlled depending on lymphocyte type, location of lymphoid organ, MuLV-ERV type, and stress duration.",,"['Lee, Kang-Hoon', 'Lim, Debora', 'Green, Tajia', 'Greenhalgh, David', 'Cho, Kiho']","['Lee KH', 'Lim D', 'Green T', 'Greenhalgh D', 'Cho K']","['Department of Surgery, Burn Research, Shriners Hospitals for Children Northern California, University of California, Davis, Sacramento, CA 95817, USA.']",['eng'],['R01 GM071360/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130105,England,BMC Immunol,BMC immunology,100966980,,IM,,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology/*virology', 'Base Sequence', 'Burns/*immunology/*virology', 'Cell Separation', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Computational Biology', 'Endogenous Retroviruses/*genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Genetic Loci/genetics', 'Genome/genetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Lymphoid Tissue/immunology/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Phylogeny', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/*virology', 'Transcription, Genetic']",PMC3562510,,2013/01/08 06:00,2013/07/05 06:00,['2013/01/08 06:00'],"['2012/04/19 00:00 [received]', '2012/12/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/01/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/01/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/05 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2172-14-2 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2172-14-2 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Immunol. 2013 Jan 5;14:2. doi: 10.1186/1471-2172-14-2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tumor hypoxia and increased hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) activity can act as major stimuli for tumor aggressiveness and progression. Although hypoxia-mediated activation of the Notch1 pathway plays an important role in tumor cell survival and invasiveness, the interaction between HIF-1alpha and Notch1 has not yet been identified in T-ALL. This study was designed to investigate whether hypoxia activates Notch1 signalling through HIF-1alpha stabilization and to determine the contribution of hypoxia and HIF-1alpha to proliferation, invasion and chemoresistance in T-ALL. METHODS: T-ALL cell lines (Jurkat, Sup-T1) transfected with HIF-1alpha or Notch1 small interference RNA (siRNA) were incubated in normoxic or hypoxic conditions. Their potential for proliferation and invasion was measured by WST-8 and transwell assays. Flow cytometry was used to detect apoptosis and assess cell cycle regulation. Expression and regulation of components of the HIF-1alpha and Notch1 pathways and of genes related to proliferation, invasion and apoptosis were assessed by quantitative real-time PCR or Western blot. RESULTS: Hypoxia potentiated Notch1 signalling via stabilization and activation of the transcription factor HIF-1alpha. Hypoxia/HIF-1alpha-activated Notch1 signalling altered expression of cell cycle regulatory proteins and accelerated cell proliferation. Hypoxia-induced Notch1 activation increased the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP2) and MMP9, which increased invasiveness. Of greater clinical significance, knockdown of Notch1 prevented the protective effect of hypoxia/HIF-1alpha against dexamethasone-induced apoptosis. This sensitization correlated with losing the effect of hypoxia/HIF-1alpha on Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL expression. CONCLUSIONS: Notch1 signalling is required for hypoxia/HIF-1alpha-induced proliferation, invasion and chemoresistance in T-ALL. Pharmacological inhibitors of HIF-1alpha or Notch1 signalling may be attractive interventions for T-ALL treatment.",,"['Zou, Jie', 'Li, Peng', 'Lu, Fei', 'Liu, Na', 'Dai, Jianjian', 'Ye, Jingjing', 'Qu, Xun', 'Sun, Xiulian', 'Ma, Daoxin', 'Park, Jino', 'Ji, Chunyan']","['Zou J', 'Li P', 'Lu F', 'Liu N', 'Dai J', 'Ye J', 'Qu X', 'Sun X', 'Ma D', 'Park J', 'Ji C']","[""Department of Hematology, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, 107 West Wenhua Road, Jinan, Shandong, 250012, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130105,England,J Hematol Oncol,Journal of hematology & oncology,101468937,"['0 (HIF1A protein, human)', '0 (Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit)', '0 (NOTCH1 protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', 'EC 3.4.24.24 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 2)', 'EC 3.4.24.35 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 9)']",IM,,"['Cell Growth Processes/physiology', 'Cell Hypoxia/physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit/genetics/metabolism', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 2/biosynthesis/genetics/metabolism', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 9/biosynthesis/genetics/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*metabolism/*pathology', 'RNA, Small Interfering/administration & dosage/genetics', 'Receptor, Notch1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transfection', 'Up-Regulation']",PMC3544631,,2013/01/08 06:00,2013/04/24 06:00,['2013/01/08 06:00'],"['2012/10/19 00:00 [received]', '2012/12/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/01/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/01/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/24 06:00 [medline]']","['1756-8722-6-3 [pii]', '10.1186/1756-8722-6-3 [doi]']",epublish,J Hematol Oncol. 2013 Jan 5;6:3. doi: 10.1186/1756-8722-6-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since both infections are endemic in North America, it was assumed as a working hypothesis that their geographic distributions were similar. Hence, the purpose of this exploratory analysis was to investigate the comparative geographical distribution of both viral infections. Counts of FIV (n=17,108) and FeLV (n=30,017) positive serology results (FIV antibody and FeLV ELISA) were obtained for 48 contiguous states and District of Columbia of the United States of America (US) from the IDEXX Laboratories website. The proportional morbidity ratio of FIV to FeLV infection was estimated for each administrative region and its geographic distribution pattern was visualized by a choropleth map. Statistical evidence of an excess in the proportional morbidity ratio from unity was assessed using the spatial scan test under the normal probability model. RESULTS: This study revealed distinct spatial distribution patterns in the proportional morbidity ratio suggesting the presence of one or more relevant and geographically varying risk factors. The disease map indicates that there is a higher prevalence of FIV infections in the southern and eastern US compared to FeLV. In contrast, FeLV infections were observed to be more frequent in the western US compared to FIV. The respective excess in proportional morbidity ratio was significant with respect to the spatial scan test (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The observed variability in the geographical distribution of the proportional morbidity ratio of FIV to FeLV may be related to the presence of an additional or unique, but yet unknown, spatial risk factor. Putative factors may be geographic variations in specific virus strains and rate of vaccination. Knowledge of these factors and the geographical distributions of these infections can inform recommendations for testing, management and prevention. However, further studies are required to investigate the potential association of these factors with FIV and FeLV.",,"['Chhetri, Bimal K', 'Berke, Olaf', 'Pearl, David L', 'Bienzle, Dorothee']","['Chhetri BK', 'Berke O', 'Pearl DL', 'Bienzle D']","['Department of Population Medicine, Ontario Veterinary College, University of Guelph, Guelph, ON, Canada. bchhetri@uoguelph.ca']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130105,England,BMC Vet Res,BMC veterinary research,101249759,,IM,,"['Animals', 'Cats', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Feline Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/*epidemiology/virology', 'Geography', '*Immunodeficiency Virus, Feline', '*Leukemia Virus, Feline', 'Leukemia, Feline/*epidemiology/virology', 'Risk Factors', 'Spatial Analysis', 'United States/epidemiology']",PMC3544736,,2013/01/08 06:00,2013/07/03 06:00,['2013/01/08 06:00'],"['2012/07/20 00:00 [received]', '2013/01/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/01/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/01/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/03 06:00 [medline]']","['1746-6148-9-2 [pii]', '10.1186/1746-6148-9-2 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Vet Res. 2013 Jan 5;9:2. doi: 10.1186/1746-6148-9-2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, little is known about its relevance in precursor T-cell lymphoblastic lymphomas (T-LBL) development. Moreover, the mechanisms whereby GLI/Hh signalling is activated in haematological malignancies are not fully clear. Here, we show that the gene Smoothened (SMO), the only non-redundant gene of this pathway, is up-regulated in mouse and human T-LBL. Interestingly, down-regulation of micro-RNAs mmu-miR-30a and mmu-miR-141 as well as hsa-miR-193b clearly contributes to enhance the expression of this gene in mouse and human lymphomas and, subsequently, to activate the GLI/Hh signalling. Activation of the GLI/Hh signalling in T-LBL promotes cell survival and proliferation, since inhibition of the pathway using short-hairpin-RNA-mediated SMO knockdown, or cyclopamine as a specific antagonist, significantly reduces these cellular processes. These findings suggest that sustained SMO up-regulation may contribute to T-LBL development and advocate the use of specific SMO inhibitors or microRNAs-based therapies as an attractive possibility to treat an important subset of T-LBL.",,"['Gonzalez-Gugel, Elena', 'Villa-Morales, Maria', 'Santos, Javier', 'Bueno, Maria Jose', 'Malumbres, Marcos', 'Rodriguez-Pinilla, Socorro Maria', 'Piris, Miguel Angel', 'Fernandez-Piqueras, Jose']","['Gonzalez-Gugel E', 'Villa-Morales M', 'Santos J', 'Bueno MJ', 'Malumbres M', 'Rodriguez-Pinilla SM', 'Piris MA', 'Fernandez-Piqueras J']","['Centro de Biologia Molecular Severo Ochoa, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas-Universidad Autonoma de Madrid, Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],['08-0188/AICR_/Worldwide Cancer Research/United Kingdom'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130103,England,Carcinogenesis,Carcinogenesis,8008055,"['0 (Gli1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Hedgehog Proteins)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (MIRN193 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Mirn141 microRNA, mouse)', '0 (Mirn30d microRNA, mouse)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled)', '0 (Smo protein, mouse)', '0 (Smoothened Receptor)', '0 (Veratrum Alkaloids)', '0 (Zinc Finger Protein GLI1)', 'ZH658AJ192 (cyclopamine)']",IM,,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival', 'Down-Regulation', 'Hedgehog Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Signal Transduction/genetics', 'Smoothened Receptor', 'Up-Regulation', 'Veratrum Alkaloids/pharmacology', 'Zinc Finger Protein GLI1']",,,2013/01/05 06:00,2013/06/19 06:00,['2013/01/05 06:00'],"['2013/01/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/01/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/19 06:00 [medline]']","['bgs404 [pii]', '10.1093/carcin/bgs404 [doi]']",ppublish,Carcinogenesis. 2013 Apr;34(4):902-8. doi: 10.1093/carcin/bgs404.

HQ-induced apoptosis of human leukemia U937 cells was characterized by the increase in mitochondrial membrane depolarization, procaspase-8 degradation and tBid production. Downregulation of Fas-associated death domain protein (FADD) blocked HQ-induced procaspase-8 degradation and rescued the viability of HQ-treated cells, suggesting the involvement of a death receptor-mediated pathway in HQ-induced cell death. HQ induced increased TNF-alpha mRNA stability led to TNF-alpha protein expression upregulation, whereas HQ suppressed TNF-alpha-mediated NFkappaB pathway activation. HQ elicited protein phosphatase 2A catalytic subunit alpha (PP2Acalpha) upregulation via p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-mediated CREB/c-Jun/ATF-2 phosphorylation, and PP2Acalpha upregulation was found to promote tristetraprolin (TTP) degradation. Suppression of p38 MAPK activation and protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) activity abrogated TNF-alpha upregulation and procaspase degradation in HQ-treated cells. Overexpression of TTP suppressed HQ-induced TNF-alpha upregulation and restored the viability of HQ-treated cells. Moreover, TTP overexpression increased TNF-alpha mRNA decay in HQ-treated cells. Taken together, our data indicate that HQ elicits TNF-alpha upregulation via p38 MAPK/PP2A-mediated TTP downregulation, and suggest that the TNF-alpha-mediated death pathway is involved in HQ-induced U937 cell death.

Here, we discuss various genetic mutations identified in Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia. We also explore various genetic targets and currently available as well as upcoming targeted therapies for ALL.",,"['Gowda, Chandrika', 'Dovat, Sinisa']","['Gowda C', 'Dovat S']","[""Department of Pediatrics, Division of Pediatric Hematology - Oncology, Penn State Hershey Children's Hospital, Milton S Hershey Medical center, Pennsylvania State University, Hershey, PA 17033, USA.""]",['eng'],['R01 HL095120/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Adv Exp Med Biol,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,0121103,,IM,,"['Humans', 'Mutation', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*genetics']",,,2013/01/05 06:00,2013/04/24 06:00,['2013/01/05 06:00'],"['2013/01/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/01/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/978-1-4614-6176-0_15 [doi]'],ppublish,Adv Exp Med Biol. 2013;779:327-40. doi: 10.1007/978-1-4614-6176-0_15.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since FDA approval of imatinib in 2001, CML treatment has been focused on tyrosine kinase inhibitors. With these targeted therapies, imatinib-resistant CML has emerged as a major problem. Second generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have allowed for effective treatment of some patients with imatinib resistance, but bcr-abl mutants such as T315I remain problematic. Additional agents are in development and are discussed here. New clinical issues with TKI treatment include premature termination of therapy due to adverse-effects, the cost of therapy, and the apparently indefinite duration of treatment in patients who have achieved complete molecular response (CMR). In contrast to Ph+ CML, targeted therapy for Ph- MPNs is novel and of less clear therapeutic potential. New insights into Ph- MPNs include alterations in the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, particularly as mediated by the JAK2 V617F mutation. The recent development of multiple JAK2 inhibitors has provided hope for the rational and effective management of these disorders. Recently, ruxolitinib was approved as therapy for PMF. Current data suggests, however, that given its vital cell signaling function, the therapeutic benefit of targeting Jak kinases in general, or JAK2 specifically may be less than that derived from ABL-directed TKI treatment of CML. This review focuses on the current treatment options for CML and Philadelphia chromosome negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) and limitations faced in current clinical practice.",,"['Bisen, Ajit', 'Claxton, David F']","['Bisen A', 'Claxton DF']","['Department of Medicine and Division of Hematology/Oncology, Penn State Hershey College of Medicine, 500 University Drive, Hershey, PA 17033, USA. ajitbisen@gmail.com.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Adv Exp Med Biol,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,0121103,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,,"['Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*drug therapy', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors']",,,2013/01/05 06:00,2013/04/24 06:00,['2013/01/05 06:00'],"['2013/01/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/01/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/978-1-4614-6176-0_8 [doi]'],ppublish,Adv Exp Med Biol. 2013;779:179-96. doi: 10.1007/978-1-4614-6176-0_8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Impaired immune function associated with obesity, increased insulin-like growth factor-I activity and stimulating effects of leptin suggest a possible biological link between anthropometric measures and leukemia. However, evidence from epidemiological studies has been inconsistent. We examined the potential association between prospective measurements of body size and risk of leukemia among participants of the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC). METHODS: During follow-up (mean = 11.52 years, standard deviation = 2.63), 671 leukemia (lymphoid leukemia = 50.1 %, myeloid leukemia = 43.2 %) cases were identified. Anthropometric measures including weight, height, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), hip circumference, and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) were measured. Cox proportional hazard models were used to explore the association between anthropometric measures and risk of leukemia. RESULTS: No associations were observed between anthropometric measures and total leukemia, and lymphoid leukemia. Risk of myeloid leukemia significantly increased for higher categories of BMI and WC among women. Analyses by subtype of myeloid leukemia showed an increased risk of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) for higher categories of WHR among women. This association seemed to be reversed for chronic myeloid leukemia. No association between anthropometric measures and myeloid leukemia were observed among men except an increased risk of AML with height. CONCLUSION: The study showed no associations between anthropometric measures and total leukemia, and lymphoid leukemia among men and women. A possible association between BMI as general obesity and WC as abdominal obesity and increased risk of myeloid leukemia among women were observed.",,"['Saberi Hosnijeh, Fatemeh', 'Romieu, Isabelle', 'Gallo, Valentina', 'Riboli, Elio', 'Tjonneland, Anne', 'Halkjaer, Jytte', 'Fagherazzi, Guy', 'Clavel-Chapelon, Francoise', 'Dossus, Laure', 'Lukanova, Annie', 'Kaaks, Rudolf', 'Trichopoulou, Antonia', 'Lagiou, Pagona', 'Katsoulis, Michael', 'Panico, Salvatore', 'Tagliabue, Giovanna', 'Bonet, Catalina', 'Dorronsoro, Miren', 'Huerta, Jose Maria', 'Ardanaz, Eva', 'Sanchez, Maria-Jose', 'Johansen, Dorthe', 'Borgquist, Signe', 'Peeters, Petra', 'Bueno-de-Mesquita, H Bas', 'Ros, Martine M', 'Travis, Ruth C', 'Key, Timothy J', 'Vineis, Paolo', 'Vermeulen, Roel']","['Saberi Hosnijeh F', 'Romieu I', 'Gallo V', 'Riboli E', 'Tjonneland A', 'Halkjaer J', 'Fagherazzi G', 'Clavel-Chapelon F', 'Dossus L', 'Lukanova A', 'Kaaks R', 'Trichopoulou A', 'Lagiou P', 'Katsoulis M', 'Panico S', 'Tagliabue G', 'Bonet C', 'Dorronsoro M', 'Huerta JM', 'Ardanaz E', 'Sanchez MJ', 'Johansen D', 'Borgquist S', 'Peeters P', 'Bueno-de-Mesquita HB', 'Ros MM', 'Travis RC', 'Key TJ', 'Vineis P', 'Vermeulen R']","['Division Environmental Epidemiology, Institute for Risk Assessment Sciences, Utrecht University, Jenalaan 18D, PO Box 80178, 3508 TD Utrecht, Netherlands. saberi.fatemeh@gmail.com']",['eng'],"['British Heart Foundation/United Kingdom', 'Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'Department of Health/United Kingdom', 'Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom', 'Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom']","['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130104,Netherlands,Cancer Causes Control,Cancer causes & control : CCC,9100846,,IM,,"['Cohort Studies', 'Europe/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/complications/*epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/complications/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Obesity/complications/*epidemiology', 'Prospective Studies', 'Risk Factors']",,,2013/01/05 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2013/01/05 06:00'],"['2012/08/20 00:00 [received]', '2012/12/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/01/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/01/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10552-012-0128-2 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Causes Control. 2013 Mar;24(3):427-38. doi: 10.1007/s10552-012-0128-2.

Primary PCL is a distinct clinic-pathological entity with different cytogenetic and molecular findings. The clinical course is aggressive with short remissions and survival duration. The diagnosis is based upon the percentage (>/= 20%) and absolute number (>/= 2 x 10(9)/l) of plasma cells in the peripheral blood. It is proposed that the thresholds for diagnosis be re-examined and consensus recommendations are made for diagnosis, as well as, response and progression criteria.

It has been suggested that different cytokines could regulate HMGB1 expression in monocytes. We have analyzed the effect of tumor necrosis factor-like weak inducer of apoptosis (TWEAK) on HMGB1 expression both in vivo and in vitro. METHODS AND RESULTS: Expression of TWEAK and its receptor fibroblast growth factor-inducible 14 (Fn14) was positively correlated with HMGB1 in human carotid atherosclerotic plaques. TWEAK increased HMGB1 mRNA expression and protein secretion in human acute monocytic leukemia cell line cultured monocytes. TWEAK-mediated HMGB1 increase was only observed in M1 macrophages but not in M2 ones. These effects were reversed using blocking anti-Fn14 antibody or nuclear factor-kappa B and phosphotidylinositol-3 kinase inhibitors. TWEAK also increased monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 secretion in human acute monocytic leukemia cell line cells, an effect blocked with an HMGB1 small interfering RNA.

We report a novel case of variant acute promyelocytic leukemia with the karyotype der (2)t(2;17)(q32;q21). Array comparative genomic hybridization revealed distinct chromosome breakpoints within the RARA and oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide-binding fold containing 2A (OBFC2A) genes. Sequence analysis of the OBFC2A/RARA transcript showed that exon 5 of OBFC2A was fused with exon 3 of RARA through the same breakpoint as in previously described fusions of RARA. The single-stranded DNA binding protein encoded by OBFC2A is critical for genomic stability. Retention of the OB fold domain of OBFC2A in the fusion protein suggests the possibility of homodimerization.

We investigated whether interfering with the interaction of the transcription factor SALL4, which is critical for leukemic cell survival, and its epigenetic partner complex represents a novel therapeutic approach. The mechanism of SALL4 in promoting leukemogenesis is at least in part mediated by its repression of the tumor suppressor phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) through its interaction with a histone deacetylase (HDAC) complex. In this study, we demonstrate that a peptide can compete with SALL4 in interacting with the HDAC complex and reverse its effect on PTEN repression. Treating SALL4-expressing malignant cells with this peptide leads to cell death that can be rescued by a PTEN inhibitor. The antileukemic effect of this peptide can be confirmed on primary human leukemia cells in culture and in vivo, and is identical to that of down-regulation of SALL4 in these cells using an RNAi approach. In summary, our results demonstrate a novel peptide that can block the specific interaction between SALL4 and its epigenetic HDAC complex in regulating its target gene, PTEN.

As a transcription factor, it is a highly desirable but difficult target for pharmacologic inhibition. We have recently shown that the TLR9 agonists CpG oligonucleotides can be used for targeted siRNA delivery to mouse immune cells. In the present study, we demonstrate that a similar strategy allows for targeted gene silencing in both normal and malignant human TLR9(+) hematopoietic cells in vivo. We have developed new human cell-specific CpG(A)-STAT3 siRNA conjugates capable of inducing TLR9-dependent gene silencing and activation of primary immune cells such as myeloid dendritic cells, plasmacytoid dendritic cells, and B cells in vitro. TLR9 is also expressed by several human hematologic malignancies, including B-cell lymphoma, multiple myeloma, and acute myeloid leukemia. We further demonstrate that oncogenic proteins such as STAT3 or BCL-X(L) are effectively knocked down by specific CpG(A)-siRNAs in TLR9(+) hematologic tumor cells in vivo. Targeting survival signaling using CpG(A)-siRNAs inhibits the growth of several xenotransplanted multiple myeloma and acute myeloid leukemia tumors. CpG(A)-STAT3 siRNA is immunostimulatory and nontoxic for normal human leukocytes in vitro.

Notably, elevated p130Cas activity is associated with leukemias and lymphomas. Since p130Cas regulates cell adhesion, we tested the hypothesis that it participates in the differentiation of hematopoietic cells. Here we show that PMA mediates the late induction of p130Cas expression in HL-60 cells, which coincided with cell aggregation and the onset of apoptosis. Ectopic p130Cas expression led to increased cell adhesion and earlier cell aggregation potentially contributing to the observed increased cell viability in these transductants. p130Cas expression concurred with the induction of its own regulator the transcription factor EGR1, its coregulator NAB2, and apoptosis. NF-kappaB inhibition in PMA-treated HL-60 cells promoted the loss of cell aggregation and cell death. We further showed a reduction of p130Cas, EGR1, and NAB2 levels in response to NF-kappaB inhibition during PMA treatment.

This action is S-phase dependent. Hence, genetic factors that decrease the half-lives of these drugs could impact efficacy. Documentation of such impact, and elucidation of underlying mechanisms, could lead to improved clinical application. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Cytidine deaminase (CDA) rapidly inactivates 5-azacytidine/decitabine. The effect of CDA SNP A79C and gender on CDA expression, enzyme activity, and drug pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics was examined in mice and humans, and the impact on overall survival (OS) was evaluated in 5-azacytidine/decitabine-treated patients with MDS (n = 90) and cytarabine-treated patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (n = 76). RESULTS: By high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), plasma CDA activity was decreased as expected in individuals with the SNP A79C. Interestingly and significantly, there was an even larger decrease in females than in males. Explaining this decrease, liver CDA expression was significantly lower in female versus male mice. As expected, decitabine plasma levels, measured by mass spectrometry, were significantly higher in females. In mathematical modeling, the detrimental impact of shorter drug half-life (e.g., in males) was greater in low compared with high S-phase fraction disease (e.g., MDS vs. AML), because in high S-phase fraction disease, even a short exposure treats a major portion of cells. Accordingly, in multivariate analysis, OS was significantly worse in male versus female patients with MDS treated with 5-azacytidine/decitabine. CONCLUSIONS: Increased CDA expression/activity in males contributes to decreased cytidine analog half-life and likely contributes to worse outcomes with 5-azacytidine or decitabine therapy.",['(c)2012 AACR.'],"['Mahfouz, Reda Z', 'Jankowska, Ania', 'Ebrahem, Quteba', 'Gu, Xiaorong', 'Visconte, Valeria', 'Tabarroki, Ali', 'Terse, Pramod', 'Covey, Joseph', 'Chan, Kenneth', 'Ling, Yonghua', 'Engelke, Kory J', 'Sekeres, Mikkael A', 'Tiu, Ramon', 'Maciejewski, Jaroslaw', 'Radivoyevitch, Tomas', 'Saunthararajah, Yogen']","['Mahfouz RZ', 'Jankowska A', 'Ebrahem Q', 'Gu X', 'Visconte V', 'Tabarroki A', 'Terse P', 'Covey J', 'Chan K', 'Ling Y', 'Engelke KJ', 'Sekeres MA', 'Tiu R', 'Maciejewski J', 'Radivoyevitch T', 'Saunthararajah Y']","['Department of Translational Hematology & Oncology Research, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH 44195, USA.']",['eng'],"['N01-CM-52205/CM/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01CM42204/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA138858/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1R01CA138858/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 CA149233/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 TR000439/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'N01CM52205/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5U54CA149233-029689/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-CM-42204/CM/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20130103,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5CSZ8459RP (Cytidine)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase 1)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNMT1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (Dnmt1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (Cytidine Deaminase)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Clin Cancer Res. 2013 Jun 1;19(11):3106-7.

Over the past decade, the use of HGFs became a common method for mobilizing human CD34+ stem cells, either for autologous or allogeneic transplantation. However, since their introduction the long-term safety of the procedure has become a major focus of discussion and research. Most information refers to healthy normal donors and data concerning pregnant and lactating women are scarce. The clinical question, which is the core of this review, is whether stem cell donation, preceded by administration of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) for mobilization, is a safe procedure for pregnant donors. METHODS Literature searches were performed in Pubmed for English language articles published before the end of May 2012, focusing on G-CSF administration during pregnancy, lactation and hematopoietic stem cell donation. Searches included animal and human studies. RESULTS Data from animals (n = 15 studies) and women (n = 46 studies) indicate that G-CSF crosses the placenta, stimulates fetal granulopoiesis, improves neonatal survival mostly for very immature infants, promotes trophoblast growth and placental metabolism and has an anti-abortive role. Granulocyte macrophage-CSF is a key cytokine in the maternal immune tolerance towards the implanted embryo and exerts protective long-term programming effects to preimplantation embryos. The available data suggest that probably CSFs should not be administered during the time of most active organogenesis (first trimester), except perhaps for the first week during which implantation takes place. Provided CSF is administered during the second and third trimesters, it appears to be safe, and pregnant women receiving the CSF treatment can become hematopoietic stem cell donors. There are also risks related to the anesthesia, which is required for the bone marrow aspiration. During lactation, there should be a period of at least 3 days to allow for clearance of CSF from milk before resuming breast feeding. With regard to teratogenicity or leukaemogenity, in non-pregnant or non-lactating women reports show that CSF administration is associated with a risk for leukemia; however, this risk is not higher compared with the control population. CONCLUSIONS The information available to date indicates that administration of CSF in general, and G-CSF in particular, is safe and healthy pregnant women can serve as donors of either bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cells. However, the clinical experience is rather limited and therefore until more data become available, G-CSF should not be used during pregnancy and lactation when other therapeutic options, instead of stem cell transplantation, are available.",,"['Pessach, Ilias', 'Shimoni, Avichai', 'Nagler, Arnon']","['Pessach I', 'Shimoni A', 'Nagler A']","['Division of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation & CBB, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel Hashomer, Israel.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20130103,England,Hum Reprod Update,Human reproduction update,9507614,['143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)'],IM,,"['Animals', 'Female', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*administration & dosage', 'Hematopoiesis', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cells', 'Humans', 'Lactation', 'Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,,2013/01/05 06:00,2013/09/26 06:00,['2013/01/05 06:00'],"['2013/01/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/01/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/26 06:00 [medline]']","['dms053 [pii]', '10.1093/humupd/dms053 [doi]']",ppublish,Hum Reprod Update. 2013 May-Jun;19(3):259-67. doi: 10.1093/humupd/dms053.

The exact phenotype of the hematopoietic stem cell and the hierarchical level of the occurrence of this mutation in leukemic hematopoiesis has not been determined. To study the effects of T315I-mutated breakpoint cluster region-abelson (BCR-ABL) in a primitive hematopoietic stem cell, we have used the murine embryonic stem cell (mESC)-derived hematopoiesis model. Native and T315I-mutated BCR-ABL were introduced retrovirally in mESC-derived embryonic bodies followed by induction of hematopoiesis. In several experiments, T315I-mutated and nonmutated BCR-ABL-transduced embryonic bodies rapidly generated hematopoietic cells on OP-9 feeders, with evidence of hematopoietic stem cell markers. After injection into NOD/SCID mice, these cells induced myeloid and lymphoid leukemias, whereas transplantation of control (nontransduced) hematopoietic cells failed to produce any hematopoietic reconstitution in vivo. Moreover, the expression of native and T315I-mutated BCR-ABL conferred to mESC-derived hematopoietic cells a self-renewal capacity demonstrated by the generation of leukemias after secondary transplantations. Secondary leukemias were more aggressive with evidence of extramedullary tumors. The expression of stem cell regulator Musashi-2 was found to be increased in bone marrow of leukemic mice.

This compound therefore, has a potential to be used as a chemotherapeutic agent against cancer. This study was done to investigate the antioxidant and anticancer activities of isatin, extracted from flower of a folklore medicinal plant Couroupita guianensis against human promylocytic leukemia (HL60) cells. METHODS: Active fractions demonstrating anticancer and antioxidant activities were isolated from the extracts of shade-dried flowers of C. guianensis by bioassay guided fractionation. The free radical scavenging activity was determined using lipid peroxidation assay. Cytotoxicity against human promylocytic leukemia HL60 cells was determined by MTT assay. Apoptotic activity was analyzed by DNA fragmentation and flowcytometry. RESULTS: Isatin isolated from the active fraction showed antioxidant activity with the EC(50) value of 72.80 mug/ml. It also exhibited cytotoxicity against human promylocytic leukemia HL60 cells in dose-dependant manner with the CC(50) value of 2.94 mug/ml. The isatin-treated cells underwent apoptosis and DNA fragmentation. Apoptosis was confirmed by the FACS analysis using FITC-annexin V markers. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: Isatin showed antioxidant activity and was cytotoxic to the HL60 cells due to induction of apoptosis. The isatin can be further evaluated to be used as a prophylactic agent to prevent the free radical-induced cancer and as a chemotherapeutic agent to kill the cancer cells.",,"['Premanathan, Mariappan', 'Radhakrishnan, Srinivasan', 'Kulangiappar, Kumarasamy', 'Singaravelu, Ganesan', 'Thirumalaiarasu, Velayutham', 'Sivakumar, Thangavel', 'Kathiresan, Kandasamy']","['Premanathan M', 'Radhakrishnan S', 'Kulangiappar K', 'Singaravelu G', 'Thirumalaiarasu V', 'Sivakumar T', 'Kathiresan K']","['Department of Biotechnology, Mepco Schlenk Engineering College, Sivakasi, India. ma.premanathan@gmail.com']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,India,Indian J Med Res,The Indian journal of medical research,0374701,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '82X95S7M06 (Isatin)']",IM,,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Antioxidants/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Flowers/*chemistry', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Isatin/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Lecythidaceae/*chemistry', 'Lipid Peroxidation/drug effects', 'Spectrum Analysis']",PMC3573604,,2013/01/05 06:00,2013/11/15 06:00,['2013/01/05 06:00'],"['2013/01/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/01/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/15 06:00 [medline]']",['IndianJMedRes_2012_136_5_822_105426 [pii]'],ppublish,Indian J Med Res. 2012 Nov;136(5):822-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of the present study was to develop a new in vitro assay that could predict the skin sensitizing potential of chemicals by measuring ROS production in THP-1 (human monocytic leukemia cell line) cells. THP-1 cells were pre-loaded with a ROS sensitive fluorescent dye, 5-(and 6-)-chloromethyl-2', 7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate, acetyl ester (CM-H2DCFDA), for 15min, then incubated with test chemicals for 30min. The fluorescence intensity was measured by flow cytometry. For the skin sensitizers, 25 out of 30 induced over a 2-fold ROS production at more than 90% of cell viability. In contrast, increases were only seen in 4 out of 20 non-sensitizers. The overall accuracy for the local lymph node assay (LLNA) was 82% for 50 chemicals tested. A correlation was found between the estimated concentration showing 2-fold ROS production in the ROS assay and the EC3 values (estimated concentration required to induce positive response) of the LLNA.

Reactive vs. neoplastic LGLs are usually morphologically indistinguishable. METHODS: We investigated 25 consecutive cases of LGL lymphoproliferation using flow cytometric T cell receptor Vbeta (FC-Vbeta) repertoire and T cell receptor gene rearrangement (TCR-GR) in detecting clonality. RESULTS: Seventeen patients (68%) were T-LGL leukemia (T-LGLL) with a male predominance, a median age of 67, and a median absolute LGL count of 2.592 x 10(9) /L. All cases were clonal using the FC-Vbeta analysis, and all but one (94%) was clonal by TCR-GR. Eight patients (32%) had reactive LGL lymphoproliferation. Two had EBV-associated infectious mononucleosis; one was clonal by both FC-Vbeta and TCR-GR; and the other was clonal only by TCR-GR. The remaining six cases were polyclonal by both assays. Patients with reactive LGL lymphoproliferation were more frequently associated with an underlying/concurrent malignancy than those with T-LGLL (4/8 cases vs. 1/17; P = 0.023, Fisher's exact test). We compared the demographic, hemogram, and clonality data between these two groups and found that the only significant difference was the lower median platelet count in the LGL lymphocytosis group (201 x 10(9) /L vs. 223 x 10(9) /L; P = 0.031; Student's t-test). A literature review including the current study showed a high sensitivity of FC-Vbeta analysis for T-LGLL (97.2%; 107/110 cases). CONCLUSIONS: FC-Vbeta analysis was slightly more sensitive than TCR-GR for the detection of clonal T cell lymphoproliferation. However, we must interpret the laboratory findings with clinical context as clonal T cell lymphoproliferation may occur in patients with viral infection.",['(c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],"['Hsieh, Y-C', 'Chang, S-T', 'Huang, W-T', 'Kuo, S-Y', 'Chiang, T-A', 'Chuang, S-S']","['Hsieh YC', 'Chang ST', 'Huang WT', 'Kuo SY', 'Chiang TA', 'Chuang SS']","['Department of Pathology, Chi-Mei Medical Center, Tainan, Taiwan; Department of Medical Laboratory Science and Biotechnology, Chung Hwa University of Medical Technology, Tainan, Taiwan.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130103,England,Int J Lab Hematol,International journal of laboratory hematology,101300213,"['0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Gene Rearrangement, beta-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Large Granular Lymphocytic/diagnosis/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Prospective Studies', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Young Adult']",,,2013/01/05 06:00,2014/05/09 06:00,['2013/01/05 06:00'],"['2012/06/18 00:00 [received]', '2012/10/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/01/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/01/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/ijlh.12041 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Lab Hematol. 2013 Oct;35(5):501-9. doi: 10.1111/ijlh.12041.

The aim of the study is to assess the efficacy of far infrared (FIR) emitting plaster in the treatment of knee OA. DESIGN: This is a randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group with equal randomization (1:1), clinical trial. Patients affected by knee OA were randomly allocated to 1 of 2 treatment groups, either placebo plaster or far infrared emitting plaster. Primary endpoint was to assess pain improvement from baseline to 1 months posttreatment in the visual analogue score (VAS). Secondary end point was to evaluate pain score after 1 week of treatment and to compare ultrasonographic findings after 1 month of treatment. RESULTS: Each group comprised 30 (in the FIR group) and 30 (in the placebo group) completers. VAS scores of the placebo and the FIR group were significantly lower at 1 week post-treatment (95% confidence interval CI = -1.14 to 0.31; P<0.05) and at the end of the study (95% confidence interval CI = -2.57 to -0.89; P=0.01). Effect size was -0.43 after one week of treatment and -1.38 after one month of treatment. The mean decrease in VAS values was >/= 20% in the FIR group. The number of patients from the FIR group with joint effusion was lower (40%) compared to baseline (80%), while no changes were seen among the placebo group.

METHODS: Using a cross-sectional study design, we investigated demographic, medical and behavioural risk factors associated with MBL. ""Low-count"" MBL (cases) were defined as individuals with very low median absolute count of clonal B-cells, identified from screening of healthy individuals and the remainder classified as controls. 452 individuals completed a questionnaire with their general practitioner, both blind to the MBL status of the subject. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for MBL were estimated by means of unconditional logistic regression adjusted for confounding factors. RESULTS: MBL were detected in 72/452 subjects (16%). Increasing age was strongly associated with MBL (P-trend<0.001). MBL was significantly less common among individuals vaccinated against pneumococcal or influenza (OR 0.49, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.25 to 0.95; P-value=0.03 and OR: 0.52, 95% CI: 0.29 to 0.93, P-value=0.03, respectively). Albeit based on small numbers, cases were more likely to report infectious diseases among their children, respiratory disease among their siblings and personal history of pneumonia and meningitis. No other distinguishing epidemiological features were identified except for family history of cancer and an inverse relationship with diabetes treatment. All associations described above were retained after restricting the analysis to CLL-like MBL. CONCLUSION: Overall, these findings suggest that exposure to infectious agents leading to serious clinical manifestations in the patient or its surroundings may trigger immune events leading to MBL. This exploratory study provides initial insights and directions for future research related to MBL, a potential precursor of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia.

Immunotherapy and chemoimmunotherapy based on monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that target cell surface antigens with restricted expression in pediatric B-ALL may offer the potential to reduce toxicities and prevent or overcome chemoresistance. The receptor tyrosine kinase ROR1 has emerged as a candidate for mAb targeting in select B-cell malignancies. METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Using flow cytometry, Western blotting, immunohistochemistry, and confocal immunofluorescence microscopy, we analyzed the cell surface expression of ROR1 across major pediatric ALL subtypes represented by 14 cell lines and 56 primary blasts at diagnosis or relapse as well as in normal adult and pediatric tissues. Cell surface ROR1 expression was found in 45% of pediatric ALL patients, all of which were B-ALL, and was not limited to any particular genotype. All cell lines and primary blasts with E2A-PBX1 translocation and a portion of patients with other high risk genotypes, such as MLL rearrangement, expressed cell surface ROR1. Importantly, cell surface ROR1 expression was found in many of the pediatric B-ALL patients with multiply relapsed and refractory disease and normal karyotype or low risk cytogenetics, such as hyperdiploidy. Notably, cell surface ROR1 was virtually absent in normal adult and pediatric tissues. CONCLUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE: Collectively, this study suggests that ROR1 merits preclinical and clinical investigations as a novel target for mAb-based therapies in pediatric B-ALL. We propose cell surface expression of ROR1 detected by flow cytometry as primary inclusion criterion for pediatric B-ALL patients in future clinical trials of ROR1-targeted therapies.",,"['Dave, Hema', 'Anver, Miriam R', 'Butcher, Donna O', 'Brown, Patrick', 'Khan, Javed', 'Wayne, Alan S', 'Baskar, Sivasubramanian', 'Rader, Christoph']","['Dave H', 'Anver MR', 'Butcher DO', 'Brown P', 'Khan J', 'Wayne AS', 'Baskar S', 'Rader C']","['Experimental Transplantation and Immunology Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],"['HHSN261200800001C/RC/CCR NIH HHS/United States', 'HHSN261200800001E/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20121220,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ROR1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Tyrosine Kinase-like Orphan Receptors)']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/metabolism/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptor Tyrosine Kinase-like Orphan Receptors/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Young Adult']",PMC3527582,,2013/01/04 06:00,2013/06/29 06:00,['2013/01/04 06:00'],"['2012/08/10 00:00 [received]', '2012/11/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/01/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/01/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/29 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0052655 [doi]', 'PONE-D-12-24073 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2012;7(12):e52655. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0052655.

The BCR-ABL inhibitor imatinib is also known to inhibit the tyrosine kinase of the stem cell factor receptor, c-Kit. Nilotinib is 30 times more potent than imatinib towards BCR-ABL in vitro. Studies in healthy volunteers and patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia or gastrointestinal stromal tumors have shown that therapeutic doses of nilotinib deliver drug levels similar to those of imatinib. The aim of this study was to compare the inhibitory effects of imatinib and nilotinib on proliferation, differentiation, adhesion, migration and engraftment capacities of human cord blood CD34(+) cells. DESIGN AND METHODS: After a 48-hour cell culture with or without TKIs, CFC, LTC-IC, migration, adhesion and cell cycle analysis were performed. In a second time, the impact of these TKIs on engraftment was assessed in a xenotransplantation model using NOD/SCID/IL-2Rgamma (null) mice. RESULTS: TKIs did not affect LTC-IC frequencies despite in vitro inhibition of CFC formation due to inhibition of CD34(+) cell cycle entry. Adhesion of CD34(+) cells to retronectin was reduced in the presence of either imatinib or nilotinib but only at high concentrations. Migration through a SDF-1alpha gradient was not changed by cell culture in the presence of TKIs. Finally, bone marrow cellularity and human chimerism were not affected by daily doses of imatinib and nilotinib in a xenogenic transplantation model. No significant difference was seen between TKIs given the equivalent affinity of imatinib and nilotinib for KIT. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that combining non-myeloablative conditioning regimen with TKIs starting the day of the transplantation could be safe.",,"['Belle, Ludovic', 'Bruck, France', 'Foguenne, Jacques', 'Gothot, Andre', 'Beguin, Yves', 'Baron, Frederic', 'Briquet, Alexandra']","['Belle L', 'Bruck F', 'Foguenne J', 'Gothot A', 'Beguin Y', 'Baron F', 'Briquet A']","['Hematology Research Unit, Giga-I3, University of Liege, Liege, Belgium. lbelle@ulg.ac.be']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121220,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (CXCR4 protein, human)', '0 (Fibronectins)', '0 (Integrin alpha4beta1)', '0 (Integrin alpha5beta1)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (retronectin)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/*metabolism', 'Benzamides/*pharmacology', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Movement/*drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Fetal Blood/*cytology/*transplantation', 'Fibronectins/metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Integrin alpha4beta1/metabolism', 'Integrin alpha5beta1/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Models, Animal', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Receptors, CXCR4/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism']",PMC3527577,,2013/01/04 06:00,2013/06/12 06:00,['2013/01/04 06:00'],"['2012/08/16 00:00 [received]', '2012/11/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/01/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/01/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/12 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0052564 [doi]', 'PONE-D-12-24585 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2012;7(12):e52564. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0052564.

As such, finding the appropriate stem cell remains the primary issue in regenerative medicine today. We isolated a pre-placental pluripotent stem cell from the chorionic villi of women with early tubal ectopic pregnancies. Our objectives in this study were (i) to identify the characteristics of hTS cells as a potential cell source for therapy; and (ii) to test if hTS cells can be used as a potential therapeutic strategy for PD. METHODS AND FINDINGS: hTS cells expressed gene markers of both the trophectoderm (TE) and the inner cell mass (ICM). hTS cells exhibited genetic and biological characteristics similar to that of hES cells, yet genetically distinct from placenta-derived mesenchymal stem cells. All-trans retinoic acid (RA) efficiently induced hTS cells into trophoblast neural stem cells (tNSCs) in 1-day. Overexpression of transcription factor Nanog was possibly achieved through a RA-induced non-genomic c-Src/Stat3/Nanog signaling pathway mediated by the subcellular c-Src mRNA localization for the maintenance of pluripotency in tNSCs. tNSC transplantation into the lesioned striatum of acute and chronic PD rats not only improved behavioral deficits but also regenerated dopaminergic neurons in the nigrostriatal pathway, evidenced by immunofluorescent and immunohistological analyses at 18-weeks. Furthermore, tNSCs showed immunological advantages for the application in regenerative medicine. CONCLUSIONS: We successfully isolated and characterized the unique ectopic pregnancy-derived hTS cells. hTS cells are pluripotent stem cells that can be efficiently induced to tNSCs with positive results in PD rat models.

It is difficult to diagnose in its early stages. The purpose of our study is to identify molecular biomarkers for PD initiation using a computational bioinformatics analysis of gene expression. We downloaded the gene expression profile of PD from Gene Expression Omnibus and identified differentially coexpressed genes (DCGs) and dysfunctional pathways in PD patients compared to controls. Besides, we built a regulatory network by mapping the DCGs to known regulatory data between transcription factors (TFs) and target genes and calculated the regulatory impact factor of each transcription factor. As the results, a total of 1004 genes associated with PD initiation were identified. Pathway enrichment of these genes suggests that biological processes of protein turnover were impaired in PD. In the regulatory network, HLF, E2F1 and STAT4 were found have altered expression levels in PD patients. The expression levels of other transcription factors, NKX3-1, TAL1, RFX1 and EGR3, were not found altered. However, they regulated differentially expressed genes.

The HIV-1 accessory gene Vpu counteracts both of these proteins, but it is thought to do so through two distinct mechanisms. Modulation of CD4 likely occurs through proteasomal degradation from the endoplasmic reticulum. The exact mechanism of tetherin modulation is less clear, with possible roles for degradation and alteration of protein transport to the plasma membrane. Most investigations of Vpu function have used different assays for CD4 and tetherin. In addition, many of these investigations used exogenously expressed Vpu, which could result in variable expression levels. Thus, few studies have investigated these two Vpu functions in parallel assays, making direct comparisons difficult. Here, we present results from a rapid assay used to simultaneously investigate Vpu-targeting of both tetherin and a viral glycoprotein, gibbon ape leukemia virus envelope (GaLV Env). We previously reported that Vpu modulates GaLV Env and prevents its incorporation into HIV-1 particles through a recognition motif similar to that found in CD4. Using this assay, we performed a comprehensive mutagenic scan of Vpu in its native proviral context to identify features required for both types of activity. We observed considerable overlap in the Vpu sequences required to modulate tetherin and GaLV Env. We found that features in the cytoplasmic tail of Vpu, specifically within the cytoplasmic tail hinge region, were required for modulation of both tetherin and GaLV Env. Interestingly, these same regions features have been determined to be critical for CD4 downmodulation. We also observed a role for the transmembrane domain in the restriction of tetherin, as previously reported, but not of GaLV Env. We propose that Vpu may target both proteins in a mechanistically similar manner, albeit in different cellular locations.",,"['Lucas, Tiffany M', 'Janaka, Sanath K', 'Stephens, Edward B', 'Johnson, Marc C']","['Lucas TM', 'Janaka SK', 'Stephens EB', 'Johnson MC']","['Department of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology, Christopher S.

The model treats the rafts as transient structures that constantly form and breakup, but that maintain a fixed average number per cell. The rafts have a high propensity for harboring Lyn kinase, aggregated, but not unaggregated receptors, and the linker for the activation of T cells (LAT). Phosphatase activity in the rafts is substantially reduced compared to the nonraft region. We use the model to analyze published experiments on the rat basophilic leukemia (RBL)-2H3 cell line that seem to contradict the notion that rafts offer protection. In these experiments IgE was cross-linked with a multivalent antigen and then excess monovalent hapten was added to break-up cross-links. The dephosphorylation of the unaggregated receptor (nonraft associated) and of LAT (raft associated) were then monitored in time and found to decay at similar rates, leading to the conclusion that rafts offer no protection from dephosphorylation. In the model, because the rafts are transient, a protein that is protected while in a raft will be subject to dephosphorylation when the raft breaks up and the protein finds itself in the nonraft region of the membrane. We show that the model is consistent with the receptor and LAT dephosphorylation experiments while still allowing rafts to enhance signaling by providing substantial protection from phosphatases.",,"['Barua, Dipak', 'Goldstein, Byron']","['Barua D', 'Goldstein B']","['Theoretical Biology and Biophysics Group, Theoretical Division, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM, USA.']",['eng'],"['R37 GM035556/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R37-GM035556/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121217,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (FCER1A protein, rat)', '0 (Haptens)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Syk Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Syk protein, rat)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (lyn protein-tyrosine kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Computer Simulation', 'Haptens/metabolism', 'Immunoglobulin E/*metabolism', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Lipoylation', 'Mast Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Membrane Microdomains/*metabolism/pathology', '*Models, Biological', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Receptors, IgE/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Syk Kinase', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tyrosine/metabolism', 'src-Family Kinases/genetics/*metabolism']",PMC3524258,,2013/01/04 06:00,2013/06/19 06:00,['2013/01/04 06:00'],"['2012/09/17 00:00 [received]', '2012/10/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/01/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/01/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/19 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0051669 [doi]', 'PONE-D-12-28446 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2012;7(12):e51669. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0051669.

AF10 is a transcription factor that has been implicated in the development of leukemia following chromosomal rearrangements between the AF10 gene and one of at least two other genes, MLL and CALM. The link between AF10 and leukemia, together with the known interactions between AF10 and hematopoietic regulators, suggests that AF10 may be important in hematopoiesis and in leukemic transformation. Here we show that AF10 is important for proper hematopoietic differentiation. The induction of hematopoietic differentiation in both human hematopoietic cell lines and murine total bone marrow cells triggers a decrease of AF10 mRNA and protein levels, particularly in stem cells and multipotent progenitors. Gain- and loss-of-function studies demonstrate that over- or under-expression of AF10 leads to apoptotic cell death in stem cells and multipotent progenitors.

Kinase inhibitors, such as imatinib, have been developed for the treatment of CML; however, the terminal, blast crisis phase of the disease remains a clinical challenge. Blast crisis CML is difficult to treat due to resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors, increased genomic instability and acquired secondary mutations. Our recent studies uncovered a role for Fyn in promoting BCR-ABL1 mediated cell growth and sensitivity to imatinib. Here we demonstrate that Fyn contributes to BCR-ABL1 induced genomic instability, a feature of blast crisis CML. Bone marrow cells and mouse embryonic fibroblasts derived from Fyn knockout mice transduced with BCR-ABL1 display slowed growth and clonogenic potential as compared to Fyn wild-type BCR-ABL1 expressing counterparts. K562 cells overexpressing constitutively active Fyn kinase were larger in size and displayed an accumulation of genomic abnormalities such as chromosomal aberrations and polyploidy. Importantly, loss of Fyn protected mouse embryonic fibroblast cells from increased number of chromosomal aberrations and fragments induced by BCR-ABL1. Together, these results reveal a novel role for Fyn in regulating events required for genomic maintenance and suggest that Fyn kinase activity plays a role in the progression of CML to blast crisis.",,"['Singh, Melissa M', 'Howard, Adrienne', 'Irwin, Mary E', 'Gao, Yin', 'Lu, Xiaolin', 'Multani, Asha', 'Chandra, Joya']","['Singh MM', 'Howard A', 'Irwin ME', 'Gao Y', 'Lu X', 'Multani A', 'Chandra J']","['Department of Pediatrics Research, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.']",['eng'],"['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'F32CA171905/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'F32 CA150610/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA115811/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'F32CA150610/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'F32 CA171905/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA115811/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20121217,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (FYN protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fyn protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fyn)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Blast Crisis/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Differentiation', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Size', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Embryo, Mammalian/cytology/metabolism', 'Fibroblasts/cytology/metabolism', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/*metabolism', 'Genomic Instability', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fyn/genetics/*metabolism/*physiology']",PMC3524192,,2013/01/04 06:00,2013/06/19 06:00,['2013/01/04 06:00'],"['2012/06/22 00:00 [received]', '2012/11/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/01/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/01/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/19 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0051611 [doi]', 'PONE-D-12-18436 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2012;7(12):e51611. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0051611.

Moreover, we report that SRSF1 is involved in other aspects of Mcl-1 regulation with knockdown of SRSF1, by RNAi, resulting in a significant decrease in Mcl-1 protein levels in MCF-7 cells but an increase in JAR cells, respectively, by potentially affecting protein stability and translation of Mcl-l.

The use of umbilical cord blood (UCB) permits transplantation of many patients who lack HLA-compatible donors due to reduced requirements for stringent HLA matching between graft and recipient; however, disease relapse remains a concern with this modality. The generation of CLL-specific CTL from UCB T-cells, primed and expanded against the leukemic clone, might enhance the GVL effect and improve outcomes with UCB transplantation. Here we report the generation of functional, CLL-specific CTL using CD40-ligated CLL cells to prime partially-HLA matched UCB T-cells. Functionality and specificity were demonstrated by immune synapse assay, IFN-gamma ELISpot, multi-parametric intracellular cytokine flow cytometry, and (51)Cr release assay. The use of patient-specific, non-CLL controls demonstrated the generation of both alloantigen and CLL-specific responses.

However, little is known about the megakaryopoietic effects of PKC agonists on primary CD34+ cells grown in culture or in vivo. Here we present evidence that the novel PKC isoform-selective agonist 3,20 ingenol dibenzoate (IDB) potently stimulates early megakaryopoiesis of human CD34+ cells. In contrast, broad spectrum PKC agonists failed to do so. In vivo, a single intraperitoneal injection of IDB selectively increased platelets in mice without affecting hemoglobin or white counts. Finally, IDB strongly mitigated radiation-induced thrombocytopenia, even when administered 24 hours after irradiation.

METHODS: To investigate the potential of MFC for MDS/MPNs, unclassifiable (MDS/MPNu), and refractory anemia associated with ring sideroblasts and marked thrombocytosis (RARS-T), we studied 91 patients with these entities (60 males/31 females; 35.3-87.4 years) for MDS-related aberrant immunophenotypes (>/= 2 different cell lineages with >/= 3 aberrantly expressed antigens). Data were correlated with cytomorphology and cytogenetics. RESULTS: MFC identified MDS-related immunophenotypes in 54/91 (59.3%) of patients. Patients with or without MDS-related immunophenotype did not differ significantly by demographic characteristics, blood values, or median overall survival. MDS-related immunophenotype cases showed a higher number of aberrantly expressed antigens (mean +/- SD, 4.9 +/- 2.4 vs. 2.0 +/- 1.4; P < 0.001). Aberrant karyotypes showed a similar frequency in patients with and without MDS-related immunophenotype (11/54; 20.4% vs. 7/37; 18.9%; P = n.s.). CONCLUSIONS: MDS-related immunophenotype are present in more than half of patients with MDS/MPNu and RARS-T.

We modified the international standardized approach (ISA) to RD detection using flow cytometry by developing a single tube 10 color antibody assay. METHOD: A single tube incorporated the following monoclonal antibodies: CD81FITC, CD22PE, CD3ECD, CD5PercP5.5, CD20PECY7, CD79bAPC, CD38A700, CD43APC Alexa750, CD19eFluor 450, and CD45KO. A modified ISA gating strategy was developed that removed contaminating events. Sensitivity assays were performed using dilution with normal peripheral blood and bone marrow. Clinical samples were compared using the ISA and the single tube assay. RESULTS: Dilution studies showed that sensitivity of 0.001% was achievable when a minimum of 1.8 x 10(6) total events were acquired. One hundred twenty-nine samples were analyzed and showed RD levels from 0.003 to 22%. In 80 samples analyzed with both assays, there was an excellent correlation between the two methods (slope = 1.0, intercept = 0.07 and R2 = 0.992) and results from Bland-Altman analysis showed a bias of 0.04 +/- 0.38 with 95% confidence interval of -0.71 to 0.79. Removal of contaminating events in the single tube assay led to a significant reduction in RD values (P = 0.0014). CONCLUSION: The single tube 10-color assay for the detection of RD in CLL provides equivalent results to the ISA but requires fewer cells, uses fewer reagents, and allows for simpler analysis. By directly removing contaminating events, it improves the accuracy of CLL RD detection and may reclassify the status of some patients following chemotherapy.",['Copyright (c) 2012 International Clinical Cytometry Society.'],"['Sartor, M M', 'Gottlieb, D J']","['Sartor MM', 'Gottlieb DJ']","['Flow Cytometry Unit, Institute of Clinical Pathology and Medical Research, Westmead Hospital, Sydney, Australia. mary.sartor@swahs.health.nsw.gov.au']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20130102,United States,Cytometry B Clin Cytom,"Cytometry.

Single nucleotide polymorphisms (rs2735383 and rs1805794) in NBS1 have been frequently studied in some cancers with discordant results in previous case-control studies. However, the relationship between these two functional polymorphisms and the susceptibility to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in Chinese population has not been investigated. We performed a case-control study with 428 patients and 600 controls to detect the association between the two polymorphisms of NBS1 and the risk of AML in a Chinese population. The polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method was carried out to determine the genotypes of potential functional SNPs in NBS1 gene. The results showed that compared with the homozygous carriers rs1805794CC, rs1805794GC genotype was significantly associated with decreased risk of AML in total subjects (adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 0.50; 95% CI = 0.37-0.67), the risk decreased even further in those carrying rs1805794GG genotype (OR = 0.23; 95% CI = 0.16-0.34). No significant association was found between rs2735383C>G polymorphism and the risk of AML (OR = 0.93; 95% CI = 0.71-1.22 for GC; OR = 0.78; 95% CI = 0.53-1.13 for CC, P = 0.152).

Causal molecular interactions can be discovered using randomized experiments; however such experiments are often costly, infeasible, or unethical. Fortunately, algorithms that infer causal interactions from observational data have been in development for decades, predominantly in the quantitative sciences, and many of them have recently been applied to genomics data. While these algorithms can infer unoriented causal interactions between involved molecular variables (i.e., without specifying which one is the cause and which one is the effect), causally orienting all inferred molecular interactions was assumed to be an unsolvable problem until recently. In this work, we use transcription factor-target gene regulatory interactions in three different organisms to evaluate a new family of methods that, given observational data for just two causally related variables, can determine which one is the cause and which one is the effect. RESULTS: We have found that a particular family of causal orientation methods (IGCI Gaussian) is often able to accurately infer directionality of causal interactions, and that these methods usually outperform other causal orientation techniques. We also introduced a novel ensemble technique for causal orientation that combines decisions of individual causal orientation methods. The ensemble method was found to be more accurate than any best individual causal orientation method in the tested data. CONCLUSIONS: This work represents a first step towards establishing context for practical use of causal orientation methods in the genomics domain. We have found that some causal orientation methodologies yield accurate predictions of causal orientation in genomics data, and we have improved on this capability with a novel ensemble method. Our results suggest that these methods have the potential to facilitate reconstruction of molecular pathways by minimizing the number of required randomized experiments to find causal directionality and by avoiding experiments that are infeasible and/or unethical.",,"['Statnikov, Alexander', 'Henaff, Mikael', 'Lytkin, Nikita I', 'Aliferis, Constantin F']","['Statnikov A', 'Henaff M', 'Lytkin NI', 'Aliferis CF']","['Center for Health Informatics and Bioinformatics, New York University Langone Medical Center, New York, NY 10016, USA. alexander.statnikov@med.nyu.edu']",['eng'],"['R01 LM011179/LM/NLM NIH HHS/United States', '1UL1RR029893/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', '1R01LM011179-01A1/LM/NLM NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20121217,England,BMC Genomics,BMC genomics,100965258,"['0 (Escherichia coli Proteins)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '0 (Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factor RelA)']",IM,,"['*Algorithms', 'Area Under Curve', 'Databases, Factual', 'Escherichia coli/genetics/metabolism', 'Escherichia coli Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Regulatory Networks', '*Genomics', 'Humans', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/metabolism', 'ROC Curve', 'Receptor, Notch1/genetics/metabolism', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae/genetics/metabolism', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription Factor RelA/genetics/metabolism']",PMC3535696,,2013/01/11 06:00,2013/06/13 06:00,['2013/01/04 06:00'],"['2013/01/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/01/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/13 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2164-13-S8-S22 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2164-13-S8-S22 [doi]']",ppublish,BMC Genomics. 2012;13 Suppl 8:S22. doi: 10.1186/1471-2164-13-S8-S22.

Initially, the patient was followed-up due to chronic lymphocytic B-cell leukemia diagnosed on the basis of histopathological examination of cervical lymph node. Eight months later, general symptoms occurred along with lymphocytosis and exacerbation of lesions in lymph nodes, and therefore, chemotherapy was started according to COP regimen. After four chemotherapy cycles, further progression of the disease was observed during chemotherapy. Computed tomography (CT) performed at that time showed generalized lymphadenopathy and the presence of an irregular area in left thyroid lobe. On palpation, the thyroid was asymmetrical, with enlarged left lobe and palpable lymph node packages on the left side of the neck. The levels of thyroid hormones and anti-thyroid antibodies were normal. Ultrasound examination of the thyroid gland showed non-homogeneous hypoechogenic structure of the left lobe and complete focal remodeling. Cytological examination of left-lobe lesion obtained during fine needle aspiration biopsy showed multiple small lymphoid cells, suggestive of small lymphocytic lymphoma. To confirm this diagnosis, flow cytometry of the biopsy material sampled from the left lobe was performed showing B cellimmunophenotype: CD19+/CD20+/CD22 dim/FMC-7, CD23+/CD5+, sCD79b-+, CD38-, CD10-, kappa and lambda-/weak reaction. The results of flow cytometry of the thyroid bioptate and blood were nearly identical, confirming leukemic nature of the infiltration in left thyroid lobe. Cytogenetic findings included the presence of 17p deletion (TP53 gene). The patient received immunochemotherapy with alemtuzumab. The progression of the disease occurred in the sixth week of therapy. The treatment was discontinued after 8 weeks due to worsening of patient's general status.

We reviewed a total of 172 febrile episodes occurring during chemotherapy in 31 children and adolescents with ALL. Temperature, hematological parameters, culture findings, and antibiotic therapy were recorded. Bacteremias were classified as transmucosal or CVC-dependent. Blood cultures were positive with mucosal pathogens in 15 cases (9%) and with skin/environmental bacteria in 34 (20%). CVC-dependent infections occurred throughout the treatment phases, while transmucosal primarily during induction therapy. Transmucosal bacteremia was associated with induction therapy, leukocyte count </=0.5 x 10(9)/L, neutrophil count </=0.1 x 10(9)/L, monocyte count </=0.01 x 10(9)/L, and platelet count </=50 x 10(9)/L. Based on logistic conversion of the odds ratios for the five factors, a weight of 2 was assigned to induction therapy and leukocyte count </=0.5 x 10(9)/L, and a weight of 1 to the remaining three parameters. The weights were included in a simple additive score ranging from 0 to 7, which defined groups with 4%, 6%, 24%, and 40% risk of transmucosal bacteremia. CVC-dependent bacteremia was not associated with markers of poor bone marrow function. In conclusion, transmucosal bacteremia in children with ALL is related to infiltration or suppression of the bone marrow.

Advances in next-generation sequencing now allow unbiased methylome profiling of entire patient cohorts, greatly facilitating biomarker discovery and presenting new opportunities to understand the biological mechanisms by which changes in methylation contribute to disease. Enrichment-based sequencing assays such as MethylCap-seq are a cost effective solution for genome-wide determination of methylation status, but the technical reliability of methylation reconstruction from raw sequencing data has not been well characterized. METHODS: We analyze three MethylCap-seq data sets and perform two different analyses to assess data quality. First, we investigate how data quality is affected by excluding samples that do not meet quality control cutoff requirements. Second, we consider the effect of additional reads on enrichment score, saturation, and coverage. Lastly, we verify a method for the determination of the global amount of methylation from MethylCap-seq data by comparing to a spiked-in control DNA of known methylation status. RESULTS: We show that rejection of samples based on our quality control parameters leads to a significant improvement of methylation calling. Additional reads beyond ~13 million unique aligned reads improved coverage, modestly improved saturation, and did not impact enrichment score. Lastly, we find that a global methylation indicator calculated from MethylCap-seq data correlates well with the global methylation level of a sample as obtained from a spike-in DNA of known methylation level. CONCLUSIONS: We show that with appropriate quality control MethylCap-seq is a reliable tool, suitable for cohorts of hundreds of patients, that provides reproducible methylation information on a feature by feature basis as well as information about the global level of methylation.",,"['Trimarchi, Michael P', 'Murphy, Mark', 'Frankhouser, David', 'Rodriguez, Benjamin A T', 'Curfman, John', 'Marcucci, Guido', 'Yan, Pearlly', 'Bundschuh, Ralf']","['Trimarchi MP', 'Murphy M', 'Frankhouser D', 'Rodriguez BA', 'Curfman J', 'Marcucci G', 'Yan P', 'Bundschuh R']","['Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA.']",['eng'],"['P50 CA140158/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA102031/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5 P50 CA140158-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'TL1 TR000091/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', '8TL1TR000091-05/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20121217,England,BMC Genomics,BMC genomics,100965258,['9007-49-2 (DNA)'],IM,,"['CpG Islands', 'DNA/metabolism', '*DNA Methylation', 'Endometrial Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism', 'Female', '*High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing/standards', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/metabolism', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Quality Control']",PMC3535705,,2013/01/11 06:00,2013/06/13 06:00,['2013/01/04 06:00'],"['2013/01/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/01/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/13 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2164-13-S8-S6 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2164-13-S8-S6 [doi]']",ppublish,BMC Genomics. 2012;13 Suppl 8:S6. doi: 10.1186/1471-2164-13-S8-S6.

PROCEDURE: The trial protocol included induction chemotherapy (randomized ""Standard"" OPEC/OJEC vs. ""Rapid"" COJEC), surgery of primary tumor and high-dose melphalan with stem cell rescue. Two hundred and sixty-two children were randomized, 69 survived >5 years, and 57 were analyzed. Data were obtained from the ENSG5 trial database and verified with questionnaires sent to participating centers. RESULTS: Median follow-up was 12.9 (6.9-16.5) years. No differences were found in late toxicities between treatment arms. Twenty-eight children (49.1%) developed hearing loss. Nine patients (15.8%) developed glomerular filtration rate <80 ml/min/1.73 m(2), but no cases of chronic renal failure were documented.

VGS bacteraemia causes considerable morbidity and mortality. The Nordic Society of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology (NOPHO)-AML protocols use higher cumulated doses of cytarabine and more chemotherapy series (n = 6) than other protocols with the potential increased risk of severe VGS infections. PROCEDURE: Medical records of all Danish children enrolled on the NOPHO-AML-2004 protocol between January 2004 and September 2011 (n = 45) were retrospectively reviewed and all febrile episodes were registered. RESULTS: Following 236 courses of chemotherapy, 112 positive blood cultures were registered. VGS were found in 38% of all positive blood cultures. Infectious episodes with VGS resulted in more days of fever and intravenous antibiotic therapy compared with infections caused by other microorganisms. VGS were involved in 45% of all episodes categorized as sepsis (n = 51) and in 67% of life-threatening bloodstream infections (n = 9). Penicillin resistance was found in 40% of the VGS strains. No significant difference was observed in the proportion of VGS isolated following courses with low-dose cytarabine versus courses with high-dose cytarabine. CONCLUSIONS: VGS were the most commonly isolated pathogens causing the most severe infections and the majority of life-threatening infections. A substantial proportion of the strains were resistant to penicillin. The high rate of VGS seemed independent of high-dose cytarabine but was more likely caused by the intensive chemotherapy treatment leading to severe mucositis and neutropenia.","['Copyright (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Johannsen, Katrine Helle', 'Handrup, Mette Moller', 'Lausen, Birgitte', 'Schroder, Henrik', 'Hasle, Henrik']","['Johannsen KH', 'Handrup MM', 'Lausen B', 'Schroder H', 'Hasle H']","['Department of Paediatrics, Aarhus University Hospital Skejby, Aarhus, Denmark.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121231,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Bacteremia/complications/*epidemiology/microbiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Streptococcal Infections/complications/*epidemiology/microbiology', 'Viridans Streptococci']",,,2013/01/03 06:00,2013/07/24 06:00,['2013/01/03 06:00'],"['2012/09/18 00:00 [received]', '2012/11/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/01/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/01/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.24448 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2013 Jul;60(7):1154-60. doi: 10.1002/pbc.24448.

Because of limited resources in this stage, prioritizing genes are relevant statistical tasks in microarray studies. For effective gene selections, parametric empirical Bayes methods for ranking and selection of genes with largest effect sizes have been proposed (Noma et al., 2010; Biostatistics 11: 281-289). The hierarchical mixture model incorporates the differential and non-differential components and allows information borrowing across differential genes with separation from nuisance, non-differential genes. In this article, we develop empirical Bayes ranking methods via a semiparametric hierarchical mixture model. A nonparametric prior distribution, rather than parametric prior distributions, for effect sizes is specified and estimated using the ""smoothing by roughening"" approach of Laird and Louis (1991; Computational statistics and data analysis 12: 27-37).

This isoform is devoid of the classical BTB/POZ domain required for nuclear localization and transcriptional repression. Depletion of p65 PLZF expression in colorectal cancer cell lines results in reduction of cell growth, loss of cell anchorage and increase in cell apoptosis.

The objective of this work is to study the role of activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule (Alcam) in HSC differentiation and self-renewal using an Alcam-null (Alcam(-/-) ) mouse model. We show here that Alcam is differentially regulated in adult hematopoiesis and is highly expressed in LT-HSCs where its level progressively increases with age. Young adult Alcam(-/-) mice had normal homeostatic hematopoiesis and normal numbers of phenotypic HSCs. However, Alcam(-/-) HSCs had reduced long-term replating capacity in vitro and reduced long-term engraftment potential upon transplantation. We show that Alcam(-/-) BM contain a markedly lower frequency of long-term repopulating cells than wild type. Further, the long-term repopulating potential and engraftment efficiency of Alcam(-/-) LT-HSCs was greatly compromised despite a progressive increase in phenotypic LT-HSC numbers during long-term serial transplantation. In addition, an age-associated increase in phenotypic LT-HSC cellularity was observed in Alcam(-/-) mice. This increase was predominately within the CD150(hi) fraction and was accompanied by significantly reduced leukocyte output. Consistent with an aging-like phenotype, older Alcam(-/-) LT-HSCs display myeloid-biased repopulation activity upon transplantation. Finally, Alcam(-/-) LT-HSCs display premature elevation of age-associated gene expression, including Selp, Clu, Cdc42, and Foxo3. Together, this study indicates that Alcam regulates functional integrity and self-renewal of LT-HSCs.",['Copyright (c) 2013 AlphaMed Press.'],"['Jeannet, Robin', 'Cai, Qi', 'Liu, Hongjun', 'Vu, Hieu', 'Kuo, Ya-Huei']","['Jeannet R', 'Cai Q', 'Liu H', 'Vu H', 'Kuo YH']","['Division of Hematopoietic Stem Cell and Leukemia Research, Department of Hematology and Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, Beckman Research Institute of City of Hope, Duarte, California 91010, USA.']",['eng'],['P30 CA033572/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Stem Cells,"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",9304532,['0 (Activated-Leukocyte Cell Adhesion Molecule)'],IM,,"['Activated-Leukocyte Cell Adhesion Molecule/metabolism/*physiology', 'Animals', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/metabolism/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout']",PMC3832064,['NIHMS437458'],2013/01/03 06:00,2014/01/08 06:00,['2013/01/03 06:00'],"['2012/07/20 00:00 [received]', '2012/11/26 00:00 [revised]', '2012/11/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/01/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/01/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/stem.1309 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells. 2013 Mar;31(3):560-71. doi: 10.1002/stem.1309.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the incidence, clinical significance and pathobiology of extramedullary AML remain ill defined. We reviewed case reports, retrospective case series, pilot studies and imaging studies of extramedullary leukemia (EML) to determine its frequency, characteristics, clinical presentation and significance. EML precedes or accompanies development of AML and occurs during or following treatment, even during remission. Although imaging studies are rarely conducted and the true incidence of EML has yet to be verified, authors have reported several estimates based on retrospective and autopsy studies. The incidence of EML in patients with AML of all ages is estimated to be about 9% and EML in children with AML was detected in 40% of patients at diagnosis. The combination of positron emission tomography and computed tomography were the most sensitive and reliable techniques of detecting and monitoring EML. Based on our literature review, the frequency of EML is likely underreported. The well-documented nature of EML in patients with AML suggests that AML can manifest as a solid tumor. The extent to which EML accompanies AML and whether EML is derived from bone marrow are unknown. Furthermore, questions remain regarding the role of the microenvironment, which may or may not facilitate the survival and proliferation of EML, and the implications of these interactions with regard to minimal residual disease, tumor cell quiescence and relapse.

Such a recurrent nature strongly suggests that these mutations play important roles in tumor development. To see whether SF3B1, U2AF1 and SRSF2 mutations occur in other human tumors besides MDS, we analyzed the hotspot mutation regions of these genes in 2,345 tumor tissues from various origins (61 MDS, other 616 hematologic tumors, 1,421 epithelial tumors and 247 non-epithelial stromal tumors) by single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis. We found SF3B1, U2AF1 and SRSF2 mutations in 5 (8.2%), 12 (19.7%) and 8 (13.1%) of 61 MDS, respectively. We also confirmed these mutations in other myeloid neoplasia, including de novo acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), chronic myelomonocytic leukemia and MDS/myeloproliferative disorder. In addition, we discovered that the SRSF2 gene was mutated in two childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemias (childhood ALL) (1.5%).

This study was to examine autophagic and apoptotic responses to protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) mediated SDT in murine leukemia L1210 cells. After SDT, the occurrence of autophagy was identified by morphological observation and biochemical analysis. Meanwhile, the mitochondria dependent apoptosis pathway was examined to participate in SDT induced cell death. The relationship between autophagy and apoptosis was further investigated by applying pharmacological inhibition studies, which indicated that impairment of autophagy enhanced the anti-tumor effect of SDT through induction of apoptosis and necrosis, while caspase inhibition did not affect autophagic vacuoles formation or protect SDT induced cytotoxicity. The findings supported that autophagic vacuoles formed upstream and independently from caspase-dependent cell death. Additionally, the possible mechanism of SDT-induced autophagy was evaluated by measurement of ROS (reactive oxygen species) formation. Result suggested ROS play important role in initiating autophagy, possibly through the sono-damaged mitochondria being enclosed by autophagic vacuoles. All together, these data indicate that autophagy may be cytoprotective in our experimental system, and point to an important insight into how autophagy inhibitors, in combination with SDT may contribute a regimen for cancer therapy.",['Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Given the lack of randomized data, to date, no regimen has emerged as standard. The authors previously evaluated cytarabine 3 g/m(2) daily for 5 days with mitoxantrone 80 mg/m(2) (the ALL-2 regimen) as a novel induction regimen. Compared with historic controls, the ALL-2 regimen was superior in terms of incidence of complete remission, failure with resistant disease, and activity in patients with Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-positive ALL. METHODS: The authors conducted a multicenter, prospective, randomized trial of the ALL-2 regimen compared with a standard 4-drug induction (the L-20 regimen). Patients also received consolidation, maintenance therapy, and central nervous system prophylaxis. The trial accrued patients from August 1996 to October 2004. RESULTS: The median follow-up for survivors was 7 years, and the median patient age was 43 years. Responses were evaluated in 164 patients. The treatment arms were balanced in terms of pretreatment characteristics. The frequency of complete remission for the ALL-2 regimen versus the L-20 regimen was 83% versus 71% (P = .06). More patients on the L-20 arm failed with resistant disease (21% vs 8%; P = .02). Induction deaths were comparable at 9% (ALL-2) versus 7% (L-20). The median survival was similar; and, at 5 years, the survival rate was 33% alive on the ALL-2 arm versus 27% on the L-20. CONCLUSIONS: Despite superior results of induction therapy with the ALL-2 regimen, this treatment did not improve long-term outcomes. When coupled to the reported experience of other studies in adults with ALL, the results of this randomized trial raise the possibility that ultimate outcomes in adult ALL may be independent of the specific regimen chosen.

Many ways have been used to prevent and treat aGVHD, however, long-term survival remains poor. The key to improve aGVHD outcomes may, in fact, rest upon successful initial therapy. The HLA-matched HSCT was limited by the shortage of suitable donors. Unmanipulated haploidentical/mismatched related transplantation with combined granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF)-mobilized peripheral blood stem cells and G-CSF-mobilized bone marrow as a stronger aGVHD inhibition and graft-versus-leukemia effect, has been developed as an alternative transplantation strategy for patients with hematologic malignancies for the advantage of immediate donor availability, ability to select the best of many relatives, controlled graft composition and immediate access to donor-derived cellular therapies if required after transplantation. G-CSF is a potent hematopoietic cytokine, which is produced by fibroblasts, monocytes, and endothelial cells. G-CSF regulates production of neutrophils within the bone marrow and affects neutrophil progenitor proliferation, maturation and is also involved in mobilization of granulocytes, stem and progenitor cells, which has an important role in this transplantation. In this article, we review the possible mechanism for this combined G-CSF-mobilized HSCT in the prevention of aGVHD.

Interestingly, recent studies have provided evidence that, in the central nervous system, PML is involved in neurogenesis. However, prospective studies of PML in brain are lacking. To further understand the role of PML in the mammalian brain, we studied plasticity and behavioral changes in PML knockout mice. If PML is involved in neurogenesis, and neurogenesis is an important process for proper brain development as well as learning and memory functions, we hypothesized that PML might have a role in plasticity and cognition. Behavioral studies demonstrated that PML knockout mice present abnormalities in conditioned learning and spatial memory, as determined by fear conditioning and Morris water maze tasks. Experiments to determine normal exploratory behavior interestingly revealed that PML knockout mice present reduced anxiety-related responses as compared to control animals. This was confirmed when PML knockout mice spent more time in the open arms of an elevated plus-maze, which is an indication of decreased anxiety. Additionally, impairments in hippocampus-dependent learning were mirrored by altered long-term plasticity at Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses. We now provide the first evidence for an important role of PML in the brain, indicating that PML might have a role in synaptic plasticity and associated behavioral processes.","['(c) 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and International Behavioural and Neural', 'Genetics Society.']","['Butler, K', 'Martinez, L A', 'Tejada-Simon, M V']","['Butler K', 'Martinez LA', 'Tejada-Simon MV']","['Department of Pharmacological and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Houston, Houston, TX 77204, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20130118,England,Genes Brain Behav,"Genes, brain, and behavior",101129617,"['0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Pml protein, mouse)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Anxiety/*genetics', 'CA1 Region, Hippocampal/physiopathology', 'Cognition Disorders/*genetics', 'Conditioning, Operant', 'Exploratory Behavior', 'Fear', 'Maze Learning', 'Memory', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Neurogenesis/genetics', 'Neuronal Plasticity/genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Synapses/physiology', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*genetics']",,,2013/01/03 06:00,2013/08/10 06:00,['2013/01/03 06:00'],"['2011/12/30 00:00 [received]', '2012/08/03 00:00 [revised]', '2012/10/09 00:00 [revised]', '2012/11/02 00:00 [revised]', '2012/12/13 00:00 [revised]', '2012/12/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/01/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/01/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/gbb.12014 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Brain Behav. 2013 Mar;12(2):189-202. doi: 10.1111/gbb.12014.

HTLV-1 encodes the oncoprotein Tax1, which is essential for immortalization of human T-cells and persistent HTLV-1 infection in vivo. Tax1 has a PDZ binding motif (PBM) at its C-terminus. This motif is crucial for the transforming activity of Tax1 to a T-cell line and persistent HTLV-1 infection. Tax1 through the PBM interacts with PDZ domain proteins such as Dlg1 and Scribble, but it has not been determined yet, which cellular PDZ proteins mediate the functions of Tax1 PBM. Here we demonstrate that Tax1 interacts with the PDZ domain protein MAGI-1 in a PBM-dependent manner, and the interaction mislocalizes MAGI-1 from the detergent-soluble to the detergent-insoluble cellular fraction in 293T cells and in HTLV-1-infected T-cells. In addition, Tax1-transformation of a T-cell line from interleukin (IL)-2-dependent to IL-2-independent growth selects cells with irreversibly reduced expression of MAGI-1 at mRNA level. These findings imply that Tax1, like other viral oncoproteins, targets MAGI-1 as a mechanism to suppress its anti-tumor functions in HTLV-1-infected cells to contribute to the transforming activity of T-cells and persistent HTLV-1 infection.",['(c) 2012 Japanese Cancer Association.'],"['Makokha, Grace Naswa', 'Takahashi, Masahiko', 'Higuchi, Masaya', 'Saito, Suguru', 'Tanaka, Yuetsu', 'Fujii, Masahiro']","['Makokha GN', 'Takahashi M', 'Higuchi M', 'Saito S', 'Tanaka Y', 'Fujii M']","['Division of Virology, Niigata University Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Niigata, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130130,England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules, Neuronal)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', 'EC 2.7.4.8 (Guanylate Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.4.8 (MAGI1 protein, human)']",IM,,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules, Neuronal/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Down-Regulation', 'Gene Products, tax/*metabolism', 'Guanylate Kinases', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/*virology', 'PDZ Domains', 'Transfection']",PMC7657234,,2013/01/03 06:00,2013/04/26 06:00,['2013/01/03 06:00'],"['2012/07/05 00:00 [received]', '2012/11/18 00:00 [revised]', '2012/12/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/01/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/01/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/cas.12087 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2013 Mar;104(3):313-20. doi: 10.1111/cas.12087.

However, significantly decreased concentrations of heat-shock protein (HSP) 70 and increased activity of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) 2,9 were detected in serum from bitches during the pre-implantation period between days 5 and 13 after mating, that is, 2-3 days after ovulation as determined by the measurement of progesterone and vaginal cytology. Especially during the implantation period and thereafter (days 15-55), high serum concentrations of antibodies against desmin are present, which is believed to indicate or regulate decidualization. Pre-implantation embryos express mRNA for enzymes and cytokines, known to promote and regulate trophoblast growth, and some intrauterine changings like the increased activity of MMP 2,9 in maternal endometrium are dependant on the presence of embryos. Some mechanisms that protect canine embryos from attack by the maternal immune system can also be identified. The embryos express CD4, a receptor known to interact with immune cells. They, furthermore, do not express MHC I and II, which might prevent them from being recognized as foreign antigen. Pre-implantation embryos express FasL, which probably renders them able to destroy Fas-bearing cytotoxic T cells. Furthermore, the uterus during pre-implantation and implantation expresses cytokines that modulate the intrauterine milieu towards a predominance of Th2 cells. During pre-implantation and implantation, an increased uterine expression of platelet activating factor (PAF) and PAFR, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and EGFR2 as well as epithelial growth factor (EGF) is characteristic. Towards placentation, the upregulation of leukaemia inhibiting factor (LIF) and at placentation the expression of insulin-like growth factor(IGF)2 and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) are striking. Progesterone receptor (PR) appears to be downregulated inside the uterus except at placentation sites, presumably where it is essential for maintenance of pregnancy. In addition, receptor-bound P4 regulates the activity of MMP 2,9. Apoptosis seems to be a further regulatory mechanism. Expression of Fas and FasL mRNA in uterine tissue is maximum until implantation, both factors then decreased significantly. These changings might indicate increased endometrial apoptosis and defence against maternal cytotoxic T cells, probably promoting trophoblast invasion. In human decidual stromal cells, GnRH is involved in the regulation of apoptosis, which is proposed to be similar in pregnant bitches, as GnRH-R is expressed at canine implantation sites. Our work investigating immunological changes in pregnant bitches has elucidated aspects of the complex physiology of implantation but raises important questions about the mechanisms involved.",['(c) 2012 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.'],"['Schafer-Somi, S']",['Schafer-Somi S'],"['Centre for Artificial Insemination and Embryo Transfer, University of Veterinary Medicine, Vienna, Austria. sabine.schaefer@vetmeduni.ac.at']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Germany,Reprod Domest Anim,Reproduction in domestic animals = Zuchthygiene,9015668,,IM,,"['Animals', 'Dogs/*embryology/*physiology', 'Embryonic Development', 'Female', 'Neovascularization, Physiologic/*physiology', 'Pregnancy', '*Pregnancy, Animal/physiology']",,,2013/01/04 06:00,2013/09/06 06:00,['2013/01/03 06:00'],"['2012/05/31 00:00 [received]', '2012/07/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/01/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/01/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/rda.12062 [doi]'],ppublish,Reprod Domest Anim. 2012 Dec;47 Suppl 6:165-8. doi: 10.1111/rda.12062.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we describe three cases showing a neutrophil-predominant dermal infiltrate admixed with abundant acellular bodies surrounded by capsule-like vacuolated spaces, which strikingly mimicked Cryptococcus. Two cases occurred within the settings of underlying hematologic malignancies; the third case was associated with immune dysregulation. Two patients were acutely ill in the medical intensive care unit. Fungal work-up, including cultures and multiple stains were negative. Because of clinical deterioration in these patients, transmission electron microscopy was pursued to definitively rule out fungal infection. In both cases, characteristics most compatible with autolysing human cells, not Cryptococcus, were identified. Chemotherapy and high-dose steroids were given, but both patients eventually succumbed to their diseases. To the best of our knowledge, these represent the first reported cases of autolysing human cells mimicking Cryptococcus organisms within neutrophilic infiltrates. They highlight the therapeutic dilemmas arising with histopathologic mimics, as well as the importance of thorough investigation to distinguish mimickers from true infectious organisms.

We investigated the accuracy of a single time point reduction of bone marrow MCs and serum tryptase level as response criteria in 50 patients with SM with available serial assessments. Bone marrow MC percentage varied significantly, with an average coefficient of variation (CV) of 65% (range, 6-173%) and 44% of patients having a CV higher than the average. The average CV for serum tryptase level was 19% (range, 0-96%), with 36% of patients having a CV higher than average. These wide variations in bone marrow MC burden and serum tryptase level were independent of the administration of SM-directed therapy, type of therapy or disease subtype. Furthermore, the achievement of a single time point therapy-induced bone marrow complete response (no histological evidence of malignant bone marrow MCs) did not correlate with tryptase level or symptomatic improvement. In conclusion, the value of single measurements of bone marrow MC percentage and serum tryptase level as response criteria in SM is not supported by clinical data.

Several of these diseases can occur in association. OBJECTIVE: Report an association of diseases related to HTLV-1 infection, occurring in an unusual age group. METHODS: Dermatological and laboratory exams were consecutively performed in HTLV-1-infected individuals from January 2008 to July 2010 in the HTLV Outpatient Clinic at the Institute of Infectious Diseases ""Emilio Ribas"" in Sao Paulo, Brazil. RESULTS: A total of 193 individuals (73 HAM/TSP and 120 asymptomatic carriers) were evaluated, three of which were associated with adult-onset IDH and HAM/TSP. In all three cases, the patients were affected by IDH after the development and progression of HAM/TSP-associated symptoms. LIMITATIONS: Small number of cases because of the rarity of these diseases. CONCLUSION: We draw attention to the possibility of co-presentation of adult-onset IDH in patients with a previous diagnosis of HAM/TSP, although IDH is a disease classically described in children.

This study found that an IkappaB kinase beta (IKKbeta) inhibitor Bay11-7082 inactivated mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 and transcription factor nuclear factor-kappaB in HTLV-1-infected T cells; this was significantly enhanced in the presence of the mTOR inhibitor everolimus. In addition, Bay11-7082 decreased production of the immunosuppressive cytokine interleukin-10 (IL-10), which was further down-regulated when Bay11-7082 was combined with evelolimus in HTLV-1-infected T and ATLL cells isolated from patients. Interleukin-10 is known to inhibit maturation and the antigen-presenting function of dendritic cells (DCs). The culture media of HTLV-1-infected MT-1 cells, which contained a large amout of IL-10, hampered tumour necrosis factor-alpha-induced maturation of DCs isolated from healthy volunteers. Culture supernatant of MT-1 cells treated with a combination of Bay11-7082 and everolimus augmented maturation of DCs in association with a decrease in production of IL-10 and enhanced the allostimulatory function of DCs. Similarly, when DCs isolated from patients with ATLL were treated with the combination of Bay11-7082 and everolimus, they were fully matured and their capability to stimulate proliferation of lymphocytes was augmented. Taken together, the combination of Bay11-7082 and everolimus might exhibit immunostimulatory properties in HTLV-1-infected T and ATLL cells isolated from patients, and this combination may be potentially therapeutic to regain the compromised immunosystem in ATLL patients.",['(c) 2012 The Authors.

We report a 31-month-old boy with acute lymphocytic leukaemia who developed permanent complete atrioventricular block (CAVB) necessitating pacemaker insertion after receiving teicoplanin for Staphylococcus epidermidis bacteremia. CASE SUMMARY: Clinical assessment of the child revealed febrile neutropenia. After thorough assessment and work-up, the patient was started on teicoplanin intravenously after which he had sudden onset of bradycardia. Electrocardiography showed CAVB that eventually required permanent pacemaker insertion. Twenty-nine months from the incident, the patient is doing well. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: We report on a case of teicoplanin-associated CAVB in a child with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). This is one of only two similar cases reported in the literature.

However, data is lacking for second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor (2GTKI) therapy after Imatinib failure. A total of 112 patients with CML in chronic phase receiving 2GTKI after Imatinib failure were reviewed. Treatment outcomes including complete cytogenetic (CCyR), major molecular (MMR) and molecular response 4.5 (4.5 log reduction of BCR-ABL1 transcript level, MR(4.5) ), treatment failure, progression-free and overall survival (OS) were compared according to BCR-ABL1 transcript levels at 3 or 6 months, divided into <1%(IS) , 1-10%(IS) and >/= 10%(IS) . BCR-ABL1 transcript level at 3 months showed better correlation with OS (P < 0.001) than that at 6 months (P = 0.147). Better OS was also observed in the patients achieving <1%(IS) (100%) and 1-10%(IS) (100%) than those with >/= 10%(IS) at 3 months (70.6%, P < 0.001).

Despite the widespread use of AgNPs, relatively few studies have been undertaken to determine the toxicity effects of AgNPs exposure. The aim of the present work was to study how AgNPs interact with four different human cell lines (hepatoma, leukemia, dermal and pulmonary fibroblast) in order to understand the impact of such nanomaterials on cellular biological functions. For toxicity evaluations, mitochondrial function (MTT assay) and membrane leakage of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH assay) were assessed under control and exposed conditions (24, 48 and 72 h of exposure). Furthermore, we evaluated the protective effect of N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) against AgNP-induced cytotoxicity. Results showed that mitochondrial function decreased in all cell lines exposed to AgNPs at 6.72-13.45 microg/ml. LDH leakage also increased in all cell lines exposed to AgNPs (6.72-13.45 microg/ml). However, the cytotoxic effect of AgNPs (13.45 microg/ml) was prevented by pretreatment of different concentrations of NAC (1-20 mM). Our findings indicate that AgNPs are cytotoxic on human tumor and normal cells, the tumor cells being more sensitive to the cytotoxic effect of AgNPs.

The transcriptional activity of NOTCH2 correlates not only with the expression of its target gene FCER2 (CD23) but is also functionally linked with CLL cell viability. In the majority of CLL cases, DNA-bound NOTCH2 complexes are less sensitive to the gamma-secretase inhibitor (GSI) DAPT. Therefore, we searched for compounds that interfere with NOTCH2 signalling at the transcription factor level. Using electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA), we identified the Aspergillum-derived secondary metabolite gliotoxin as a potent NOTCH2 transactivation inhibitor. Gliotoxin completely blocked the formation of DNA-bound NOTCH2 complexes in CLL cells independent of their sensitivity to DAPT. The inhibition of NOTCH2 signalling by gliotoxin was associated with down regulation of CD23 (FCER) expression and induction of apoptosis. Short time exposure of CLL cells indicated that the early apoptotic effect of gliotoxin is independent of proteasome regulated nuclear factor kappaB activity, and is associated with up regulation of NOTCH3 and NR4A1 expression. Gliotoxin could overcome the supportive effect of primary bone marrow stromal cells in an ex vivo CLL microenvironment model.

Unmet service needs were rank ordered, and nonparametric tests were run to assess relationships. RESULTS: The rate of unmet need was highest regarding sexual issues, handling medical and living expenses, emotional difficulties, employment, and health insurance. Women were more likely to report unmet child care needs than men; younger individuals were more likely to report needing help with emotional difficulties and family problems; and lower income was related to greater unmet need regarding medical and living expenses. Relationships were also observed among the service needs, suggesting overlapping areas of unmet need.

Several genes and signaling pathways control the fine balance between self-renewal and differentiation in HSCs and potentially also in leukemia stem cells. Recently, studies have shed light on developmental molecules and evolutionarily conserved signals as regulators of stem cells in hematopoiesis and leukemia. In this study, we provide evidence that the cell fate determinant Llgl1 (lethal giant larvae homolog 1) plays an important role in regulation of HSCs. Loss of Llgl1 leads to an increase in HSC numbers that show increased repopulation capacity and competitive advantage after transplantation. This advantage increases upon serial transplantation or when stress is applied to HSCs. Llgl1(-/-) HSCs show increased cycling but neither exhaust nor induce leukemia in recipient mice.

Recent data suggest a paradoxical association between CMV reactivation after allo-SCT and reduced leukemic relapse. Given the potential of Vdelta2-negative gammadeltaT cells to recognize CMV-infected cells and tumor cells, the molecular biology of distinct gammadeltaT-cell subsets expanding during CMV reactivation after allo-SCT was investigated. Vdelta2(neg) gammadeltaT-cell expansions after CMV reactivation were observed not only with conventional but also cordblood donors. Expanded gammadeltaT cells were capable of recognizing both CMV-infected cells and primary leukemic blasts. CMV and leukemia reactivity were restricted to the same clonal population, whereas other Vdelta2(neg) T cells interact with dendritic cells (DCs). Cloned Vdelta1 T-cell receptors (TCRs) mediated leukemia reactivity and DC interactions, but surprisingly not CMV reactivity. Interestingly, CD8alphaalpha expression appeared to be a signature of gammadeltaT cells after CMV exposure. However, functionally, CD8alphaalpha was primarily important in combination with selected leukemia-reactive Vdelta1 TCRs, demonstrating for the first time a co-stimulatory role of CD8alphaalpha for distinct gammadeltaTCRs. Based on these observations, we advocate the exploration of adoptive transfer of unmodified Vdelta2(neg) gammadeltaT cells after allo-SCT to tackle CMV reactivation and residual leukemic blasts, as well as application of leukemia-reactive Vdelta1 TCR-engineered T cells as alternative therapeutic tools.",,"['Scheper, W', 'van Dorp, S', 'Kersting, S', 'Pietersma, F', 'Lindemans, C', 'Hol, S', 'Heijhuurs, S', 'Sebestyen, Z', 'Grunder, C', 'Marcu-Malina, V', 'Marchant, A', 'Donner, C', 'Plachter, B', 'Vermijlen, D', 'van Baarle, D', 'Kuball, J']","['Scheper W', 'van Dorp S', 'Kersting S', 'Pietersma F', 'Lindemans C', 'Hol S', 'Heijhuurs S', 'Sebestyen Z', 'Grunder C', 'Marcu-Malina V', 'Marchant A', 'Donner C', 'Plachter B', 'Vermijlen D', 'van Baarle D', 'Kuball J']","['Department of Hematology and Immunology, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['10-0736/Worldwide Cancer Research/United Kingdom'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130101,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta)']",IM,,"['Cytomegalovirus/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/immunology/*surgery', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta/immunology', '*Stem Cell Transplantation', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Transplantation, Homologous', '*Virus Activation']",,,2013/01/02 06:00,2013/08/10 06:00,['2013/01/02 06:00'],"['2013/01/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/01/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/10 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2012374 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2012.374 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2013 Jun;27(6):1328-38. doi: 10.1038/leu.2012.374.

Hoechst staining indicated more features of apoptosis, namely nuclear blebs and shrunken nuclei in HuT-102 than Jurkat. A greater depletion of the antioxidant enzyme glutathione occurred in Jurkat, which consequently led to an increase in ROS, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, cytochrome c release, activation of caspases 3 and 9, and cleavage of PARP. Treatment with z-VAD-fmk partially reversed TQ-induced apoptosis, suggesting a caspase-dependent mechanism. N-acetyl cysteine prevented apoptosis providing evidence that cell death is ROS-dependent. Catalase prevented apoptosis to a lesser extent than NAC.

This heterogeneity may contribute to the fine-tuning of signal amplitudes and duration from different receptors. The colony-stimulating factor 3 receptor (CSF3R) is unique for its balanced signaling output, first leading to proliferation of myeloid progenitors, followed by a cell cycle arrest and granulocytic differentiation. The mechanisms associated with CSF3R signal modulation, involving receptor lysine ubiquitination and redox-controlled phosphatase activities, are to a large extent confined to the signaling endosome.

In the group who received clofarabine and subsequent transplantation, there were no cases of VOD, and liver toxicity was comparable to a control group who received standard acute myeloid leukemia (AML) chemotherapy. Other transplant-specific outcomes, including overall survival (OS), were also similar when compared with the control group. BACKGROUND: Clofarabine is actively being investigated as a component of frontline chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Hepatotoxicity is 1 of the primary adverse events associated with clofarabine and can occasionally can include severe venoocclusive disease (VOD). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Many patients with AML undergo allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT), a procedure that is also associated with hepatotoxicity. We identified AML patients undergoing allo-SCT and stratified them according to whether they received clofarabine-containing (clofarabine, idarubicin, and cytarabine [CIA]) or non-clofarabine-containing cytarabine-based induction/consolidation chemotherapy (idarubicin and cytarabine [ara-C] [IA]). We compared both groups for differences in posttransplantation hepatotoxicity, VOD, and other transplantation outcomes. Forty-two patients were identified (20 receiving CIA and 22 receiving IA). Patient and transplant characteristics were similar. All patients receiving clofarabine-based treatment received CIA within 2.5 months of their allo-SCT. RESULTS: There was no difference in the incidence of VOD in the 30 days after transplantation (0 CIA, 1 IA; P = 1.0). Rates of grade 3/4 hepatotoxicity also did not differ between groups.

We have previously shown that graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) can negatively impact quantitative responses to vaccines. Using a minor histocompatibility Ag-mismatched BMT (B6 --> B6 x C3H.SW) followed by adoptive transfer of HY-specific T cells and HY-expressing dendritic cells, we assessed whether GVHD induced by donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) affects the persistence, proliferation, and survival of vaccine-responding, nonalloantigen reactive T cells. Both CD8(+) and CD4(+) HY-specific T cells undergo less vaccine-driven proliferation in allogeneic recipients with GVHD. Although vaccine-responding CD8(+) T cells show decreased IFN-gamma and CD107a production, CD4(+) T cells exhibit increased programmed death 1 and T cell Ig mucin-like domain 3 expression. In addition, the degree of apoptosis in vaccine-responding CD8(+) T cells was higher in the presence of GVHD, but there was no difference in CD4(+) T cell apoptosis. Using Fas ligand-deficient or TRAIL-deficient DLI had no impact on apoptosis of HY-specific T cells. However, perforin-deficient alloreactive DLI induced significantly less apoptosis of vaccine-responding CD8(+) T cells and resulted in enhanced tumor protection. Thus, diminished vaccine responses during GVHD result from impaired proliferation of CD8(+) and CD4(+) T cells responding to vaccination, with an additional contribution from perforin-mediated CD8(+) T cell apoptosis. These results provide important insights toward optimizing vaccine responses after allogeneic BMT.",,"['Capitini, Christian M', 'Nasholm, Nicole M', 'Duncan, Brynn B', 'Guimond, Martin', 'Fry, Terry J']","['Capitini CM', 'Nasholm NM', 'Duncan BB', 'Guimond M', 'Fry TJ']","['Blood and Marrow Transplant Section, Pediatric Oncology Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA. ccapitini@pediatrics.wisc.edu']",['eng'],['ZIA BC011295-03/Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20121228,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Cancer Vaccines)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Fasl protein, mouse)', '0 (H-Y Antigen)', '0 (Immunodominant Epitopes)', '0 (Minor Histocompatibility Antigens)', '0 (Pore Forming Cytotoxic Proteins)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (Tnfsf10 protein, mouse)', '0 (perforin, mouse)']",IM,,"['Adoptive Transfer', 'Animals', 'Animals, Congenic', 'Apoptosis/*immunology', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Cancer Vaccines/*immunology/therapeutic use', 'Carcinoma, Transitional Cell/immunology/pathology/therapy', 'Cell Division', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Dendritic Cells/*immunology', 'Fas Ligand Protein/deficiency/immunology', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*immunology', 'H-Y Antigen/immunology', 'Immunodominant Epitopes/immunology', '*Immunotherapy', 'Lymphocyte Transfusion', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Minor Histocompatibility Antigens/immunology', 'Pore Forming Cytotoxic Proteins/*physiology', 'Radiation Chimera', 'Specific Pathogen-Free Organisms', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/*immunology', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/deficiency/immunology', '*Vaccination']",PMC3626171,['NIHMS429381'],2013/01/01 06:00,2013/03/27 06:00,['2013/01/01 06:00'],"['2013/01/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/01/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/27 06:00 [medline]']","['jimmunol.1200391 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1200391 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2013 Feb 1;190(3):1351-9. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1200391.

Although DNA sequencing has uncovered spliceosome gene mutations that promote alternative splicing and portend leukemic transformation, isoform diversity also may be generated by RNA editing mediated by adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) enzymes that regulate stem cell maintenance. In this study, whole-transcriptome sequencing of normal, chronic phase, and serially transplantable blast crisis chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) progenitors revealed increased IFN-gamma pathway gene expression in concert with BCR-ABL amplification, enhanced expression of the IFN-responsive ADAR1 p150 isoform, and a propensity for increased adenosine-to-inosine RNA editing during CML progression. Lentiviral overexpression experiments demonstrate that ADAR1 p150 promotes expression of the myeloid transcription factor PU.1 and induces malignant reprogramming of myeloid progenitors. Moreover, enforced ADAR1 p150 expression was associated with production of a misspliced form of GSK3beta implicated in LSC self-renewal. Finally, functional serial transplantation and shRNA studies demonstrate that ADAR1 knockdown impaired in vivo self-renewal capacity of blast crisis CML progenitors.

Here, we uncover Mcl-1 as a dominant and tissue-specific survival factor in SCC, providing a roadmap for a new therapeutic approach. Treatment with the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor vorinostat regulates Bcl-2 family member expression to disable the Mcl-1 axis and thereby induce apoptosis in SCC cells. Although Mcl-1 dominance renders SCC cells resistant to the BH3-mimetic ABT-737, vorinostat primes them for sensitivity to ABT-737 by shuttling Bim from Mcl-1 to Bcl-2/Bcl-xl, resulting in dramatic synergy for this combination and sustained tumor regression in vivo. Moreover, somatic FBW7 mutation in SCC is associated with stabilized Mcl-1 and high Bim levels, resulting in a poor response to standard chemotherapy but a robust response to HDAC inhibitors and enhanced synergy with the combination vorinostat/ABT-737.

We used 2001-2009 Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database records to identify a cohort of women with first primary stage 0 BC who were treated with radiation, a group which is not treated with chemotherapy. We identified subsequent MDS/AML diagnoses in the cohort using SEER to query appropriate ICD-O-3 codes. We compared observed MDS/AML rates in the BC cohort to expected rates, estimated as first primary MDS/AML in the entire female population, and calculated observed/expected rate ratios with 95 % confidence intervals (CI). Overall, a very small number of cases of MDS/AML occurred in this cohort with 22 observed cases versus 9.4 expected cases using national incidence data. We estimated an increased risk of 2.34 for MDS/AML in stage 0 BC cases treated with radiation compared to the general population (95 % CI 1.49, 3.46, p < 0.001). The age adjusted relative risk is 1.46, (95 % CI 0.93, 2.16, p = 0.08).

We conducted a phase I trial to begin testing the hypothesis that rifaximin, a broadly acting oral antibiotic, would reduce systemic inflammation and T-cell activation. We administered rifaximin to 20 adolescents and younger adults (day -10 through day +30) receiving intensive conditioning. We measured the plasma level of interleukin-6, as a marker of conditioning-induced inflammation, and the levels of soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor-1 and soluble interleukin-2 receptor, as surrogate markers of AGVHD. We formed a historical control group (n=24), from a previous study of biomarkers in AGVHD. The increase in the treatment group's mean interleukin-6 level from baseline to day 0 was 73% less than that in the control group (P=0.006). The increase from baseline to day 15 in the treatment group's mean soluble tumor necrosis factor-1 and soluble interleukin-2 receptor levels was similar to the control group.

In this study, we describe the clinical characteristics of children with hematological malignancies and laboratory-proven H1N1 influenza. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were recruited from 3 pediatric hematology/oncology units in Lebanon. A confirmed case of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza is a clinically suspected case with positive H1N1 test by either a rapid immunofluorescence test or by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Data were collected retrospectively from the medical charts. RESULTS: From October 2009 to March 2010, 14 immunocompromised children were infected with H1N1 influenza. Eight were male and 6 were female. The median age of patients was 4.5 years (range, 1 to 14). All children were hospitalized and treated with oseltamivir. Twelve children responded to treatment; the other 2 patients with severe respiratory distress were transferred to intensive care unit and resuscitated but died after 7 and 12 days. CONCLUSIONS: Immunocompromised children infected with pandemic 2009 influenza may respond very well when the diagnosis and treatment are rapid.

Caregivers of pediatric patients were surveyed to establish educational needs for safe handling of oral chemotherapy agents. METHODS: An 11-question self-report survey was developed to characterize handling practices for patients in maintenance therapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia related to caregiver education, use of protective gear, preparation, and disposal of oral chemotherapy agents. RESULTS: Fifty questionnaires were collected. Seventy-two percent of responders reported receiving instruction on safe handling of oral chemotherapy. Ninety percent of responders reported that they did not utilize protective gear during preparation of oral chemotherapy. Although tablet crushers were designated for use with oral chemotherapy by 61% of responders, 22% used the same device to crush other nonchemotherapy medications.

In this report, we retrospectively investigated the effect of intensified conditioning on adult ALAL undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). A total of 59 patients with ALAL (male in 37 cases and female in 22 cases) were consecutively enrolled in the data analyses. Twenty-four patients received the standard conditioning (total body irradiation (TBI) + cyclophosphamide (CY) or busulfan + CY protocol) and 35 received the intensified conditioning (TBI + CY + etoposide or fludarabine + cytarabine plus TBI + CY + etoposide protocol).

METHODS: The National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database of the 9 original tumor registries (SEER-9) was queried to identify patients aged 0 to 19 years with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia, bone and joint cancer, cancer of the brain and nervous system, Hodgkin lymphoma, neuroblastoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, soft tissue cancer, Wilms tumor, or retinoblastoma from 1973 to 2008. Patients were grouped into 4-year time epochs. The number and percentage of patients who received RT as part of their initial treatment were calculated per epoch by each diagnosis group from 1973 to 2008. RESULTS: RT use for acute lymphoblastic leukemia, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and retinoblastoma declined sharply from 57%, 57%, and 30% in 1973 to 1976 to 11%, 15%, and 2%, respectively, in 2005 to 2008. Similarly, smaller declines in RT use were also seen in brain cancer (70%-39%), bone cancer (41%-21%), Wilms tumor (75%-53%), and neuroblastoma (60%-25%). RT use curves for Wilms tumor and neuroblastoma were nonlinear with nadirs in 1993 to 1996 at 39% and 19%, respectively. There were minimal changes in RT use for Hodgkin lymphoma, soft tissue cancer, or acute myeloid leukemia, roughly stable at 72%, 40%, and 11%, respectively. Almost all patients treated with RT were given external beam RT exclusively. However, from 1985 to 2008, treatments involving brachytherapy, radioisotopes, or combination therapy increased in frequency, comprising 1.8%, 4.6%, and 11.9% of RT treatments in brain cancer, soft tissue cancer, and retinoblastoma, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The use of RT is declining over time in 7 of 10 pediatric cancer categories. A limitation of this study is a potential under-ascertainment of RT use in the SEER-9 database including the delayed use of RT.",['Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

We have found that Ell3, a member of the Ell (eleven-nineteen lysine-rich leukemia gene) family of RNA Pol II elongation factors, occupies enhancers in embryonic stem cells. Ell3's association with enhancers is required for setting up proper Pol II occupancy at the promoter-proximal regions of developmentally regulated genes and for the recruitment of the super elongation complex (SEC) to these loci following differentiation signals. Furthermore, Ell3 binding to inactive or poised enhancers is essential for stem cell specification. We have also detected the presence of Pol II and Ell3 in germ cell nuclei.

The long S6K1 variant (Iso-1) induced opposite effects. It inhibits Ras-induced transformation and tumor formation, while its knockdown or knockout induces transformation, suggesting that Iso-1 has a tumor-suppressor activity. Furthermore, we found that S6K1 short isoforms bind and activate mTORC1, elevating 4E-BP1 phosphorylation, cap-dependent translation, and Mcl-1 protein levels. Both a phosphorylation-defective 4E-BP1 mutant and the mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin partially blocked the oncogenic effects of S6K1 short isoforms, suggesting that these are mediated by mTORC1 and 4E-BP1.

We hypothesized that unknown regions of copy number variation (CNV) affect clinical outcome and can be detected by array-based single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping. We compared SNP genotypes from 168 untreated patients with CLL with genotypes from 73 white HapMap controls. We identified 322 regions of recurrent CNV, 82 of which occurred significantly more often in CLL than in HapMap (CLL-specific CNV), including regions typically aberrant in CLL: deletions in 6q21, 11q22, 13q14, and 17p13 and trisomy 12. In univariate analyses, 35 of total and 11 of CLL-specific CNVs were associated with unfavorable time-to-event outcomes, including gains or losses in chromosomes 2p, 4p, 4q, 6p, 6q, 7q, 11p, 11q, and 17p. In multivariate analyses, six CNVs (ie, CLL-specific variations in 11p15.1-15.4 or 6q27) predicted time-to-treatment or overall survival independently of established markers of prognosis. Moreover, genotypic complexity (ie, the number of independent CNVs per patient) significantly predicted prognosis, with a median time-to-treatment of 64 months versus 23 months in patients with zero to one versus two or more CNVs, respectively (P = 3.3 x 10(-8)). In summary, a comparison of SNP genotypes from patients with CLL with HapMap controls allowed us to identify known and unknown recurrent CNVs and to determine regions and rates of CNV that predict poorer prognosis in patients with CLL.","['Copyright (c) 2013 American Society for Investigative Pathology and the', 'Association for Molecular Pathology.

This disease is known as ""hereditary cerebral hemorrhage with amyloidosis-Icelandic type"" or ""hereditary cystatin C amyloid angiopathy."" The mutant cystatin C protein forms aggregates and amyloid, within the central nervous system almost exclusively in connection with the vascular system. It was not known whether immune cells could remove mutant cystatin C protein aggregates. Ex vivo mutant cystatin C protein aggregates, both in solution and dried onto a glass surface, induced adhesion to the substrate, differentiated the THP-1 monocyte cell line and led to a proinflammatory response. Aggregates were also taken up by both THP-1 cells and THP-1 derived macrophages. These are the same responses induced by other amyloidogenic protein species, such as amyloid beta protein and amylin, supporting the model of all amyloidogenic proteins being toxic due to common structural motifs. Proinflammatory response induced by the ex vivo mutant cystatin C protein aggregates suggests that vascular inflammation plays an important role in hereditary cerebral hemorrhage with amyloidosis-Icelandic type.

Among these are a variety of lymphomas, including Hodgkin's lymphoma (Hodgkin's disease), Burkitt lymphoma, and a host of other non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. Through innovative and ground-breaking studies, some of these malignancies have been directly linked to viral infection, such as the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), while others have been merely associated with infection through epidemiologic studies and case-reports. Some malignancies have been demonstrated to be caused by viral infection, such as adult T-cell leukemia and lymphoma (ATLL), which is caused by the human T cell lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I), in certain endemic area.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Healthy subjects belonging to three Asian populations (Chinese, Malay, Indian; n = 70 each) and CML patients (n = 38) were enrolled in a prospective pharmacogenetics study. Imatinib trough (C(0h)) and clearance (CL) were determined in the patients at steady state. Haplowalk method was applied to infer the haplotypes and generalized linear model (GLM) to estimate haplotypic effects on IM pharmacokinetics. Association of haplotype copy numbers with IM pharmacokinetics was defined by Mann-Whitney U test. RESULTS: Global haplotype score statistics revealed a SLC22A1 sub-haplotypic region encompassing three polymorphisms (rs3798168, rs628031 and IVS7+850C>T), to be significantly associated with IM clearance (p = 0.013). Haplotype-specific GLM estimated that the haplotypes AGT and CGC were both associated with 22% decrease in clearance compared to CAC [CL (10(-2) L/hr/mg): CAC vs AGT: 4.03 vs 3.16, p = 0.017; CAC vs CGC: 4.03 vs 3.15, p = 0.017]. Patients harboring 2 copies of AGT or CGC haplotypes had 33.4% lower clearance and 50% higher C(0h) than patients carrying 0 or 1 copy [CL (10(-2) L/hr/mg): 2.19 vs 3.29, p = 0.026; C(0h) (10(-6) 1/ml): 4.76 vs 3.17, p = 0.013, respectively]. Further subgroup analysis revealed SLC22A1 and ABCB1 haplotypic combinations to be significantly associated with clearance and C(0h) (p = 0.002 and 0.009, respectively).

The present study investigated the effect of caffeine and different glucocorticoids on expression of surfactant protein (SP)-B, crucial for the physiological function of pulmonary surfactant. We measured expression levels of SP-B, various SP-B transcription factors including erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 4 (ErbB4) and thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1), as well as the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) after administering different doses of glucocorticoids, caffeine, cAMP, or the phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor rolipram in the human airway epithelial cell line NCI-H441. Administration of dexamethasone (1 microM) or caffeine (5 mM) stimulated SP-B mRNA expression with a maximal of 38.8+/-11.1-fold and 5.2+/-1.4-fold increase, respectively. Synergistic induction was achieved after co-administration of dexamethasone (1 mM) in combination with caffeine (10 mM) (206+/-59.7-fold increase, p<0.0001) or cAMP (1 mM) (213+/-111-fold increase, p = 0.0108). SP-B mRNA was synergistically induced also by administration of caffeine with hydrocortisone (87.9+/-39.0), prednisolone (154+/-66.8), and betamethasone (123+/-6.4). Rolipram also induced SP-B mRNA (64.9+/-21.0-fold increase). We detected a higher expression of ErbB4 and GR mRNA (7.0- and 1.7-fold increase, respectively), whereas TTF-1, Jun B, c-Jun, SP1, SP3, and HNF-3alpha mRNA expression was predominantly unchanged. In accordance with mRNA data, mature SP-B was induced significantly by dexamethasone with caffeine (13.8+/-9.0-fold increase, p = 0.0134). We found a synergistic upregulation of SP-B mRNA expression induced by co-administration of various glucocorticoids and caffeine, achieved by accumulation of intracellular cAMP.

While proinflammatory roles of TLR2 and TLR4 are well documented, the role of TLR6 in inflammation is poorly understood. In order to understand mechanisms of action of TLR6 in inflammatory responses, we investigated the effects of FSL-1, the TLR6 ligand, on expression of chemokine CCL2 and cytokine IL-1beta and determined cellular factors involved in FSL-1-mediated expression of CCL2 and IL-1beta in mononuclear cells. Exposure of human monocytic leukemia THP-1 cells to FSL-1 resulted not only in enhanced secretion of CCL2 and IL-1beta, but also profound induction of their gene transcripts. Expression of CCL2 was abrogated by treatment with OxPAPC, a TLR-2/4 inhibitor, while treatment with OxPAPC resulted in partially inhibited expression of IL-1beta. Treatment with FSL-1 resulted in enhanced phosphorylation of Akt and mitogen-activated protein kinases and activation of protein kinase C. Treatment with pharmacological inhibitors, including SB202190, SP6001250, U0126, Akt inhibitor IV, LY294002, GF109203X, and RO318220 resulted in significantly attenuated FSL-1-mediated upregulation of CCL2 and IL-1beta.

Because of transcription from two distinct promoters, the p63 gene encodes two isoforms, TAp63 and DeltaNp63. Although TAp63 acts as a tumor suppressor, DeltaNp63 functions as an oncogene and is often overexpressed in squamous cell carcinomas. Thus, therapeutic agents targeting DeltaNp63 might be used to manage tumors that overexpress DeltaNp63. Here we found that arsenic trioxide, a frontline agent for acute promyelocytic leukemia, inhibits DeltaNp63 but not TAp63 expression in time- and dose-dependent manners. In addition, we found that arsenic trioxide decreases the stability of DeltaNp63 protein via a proteasome-dependent pathway but has little effect on the level of DeltaNp63 transcript. Furthermore, we found that arsenic trioxide activates the Pirh2 promoter and consequently induces Pirh2 expression. Consistent with this, we found that knockdown of Pirh2 inhibits, whereas ectopic expression of Pirh2 enhances, arsenic-induced degradation of DeltaNp63 protein. Importantly, we found that knockdown of DeltaNp63 sensitizes, whereas ectopic expression of DeltaNp63 inhibits, growth suppression induced by arsenic. Together, these data suggest that arsenic degrades DeltaNp63 protein at least in part via Pirh2-dependent proteolysis and that inhibition of DeltaNp63 expression facilitates tumor cells to arsenic-induced death.",,"['Yan, Wensheng', 'Chen, Xiufang', 'Zhang, Yanhong', 'Zhang, Jin', 'Jung, Yong-Sam', 'Chen, Xinbin']","['Yan W', 'Chen X', 'Zhang Y', 'Zhang J', 'Jung YS', 'Chen X']","['Comparative Oncology Laboratory, University of California at Davis, Davis, California 95616, USA. wyan@ucdavis.edu']",['eng'],"['R01 CA102188/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA123227/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20121227,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Leupeptins)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (TP63 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (RCHY1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)', 'RF1P63GW3K (benzyloxycarbonylleucyl-leucyl-leucine aldehyde)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,,"['Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/genetics', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Humans', 'Leupeptins/pharmacology', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/*metabolism', 'Protein Stability/drug effects', 'Proteolysis/*drug effects', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/*metabolism']",PMC3561513,,2012/12/29 06:00,2013/03/30 06:00,['2012/12/29 06:00'],"['2012/12/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/12/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/30 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)46408-7 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M112.428607 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2013 Feb 1;288(5):2907-13. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M112.428607.

If fever persisted for 96 h, patients were switched to open-label intravenous voriconazole; oral treatment was permitted after 96 h. The primary endpoint was the rate of proven/probable IFIs between Days 2 and 28 after fever onset in the modified intent-to-treat (mITT) complete-case population. One hundred and forty-seven patients were randomized to immediate (n = 81) or deferred (n = 66) voriconazole.

However, information on the physiological function of MLF1 is limited and mostly derived from studies identifying MLF1 interaction partners like CSN3, MLF1IP, MADM, Manp and the 14-3-3 proteins. The 14-3-3-binding site surrounding S34 is one of the only known functional features of the MLF1 sequence, along with one nuclear export sequence (NES) and two nuclear localization sequences (NLS). It was recently shown that the subcellular localization of mouse MLF1 is dependent on 14-3-3 proteins. Based on these findings, we investigated whether the subcellular localization of human MLF1 was also directly 14-3-3-dependent. Live cell imaging with GFP-fused human MLF1 was used to study the effects of mutations and deletions on its subcellular localization. Surprisingly, we found that the subcellular localization of full-length human MLF1 is 14-3-3-independent, and is probably regulated by other as-yet-unknown proteins.",,"['Molzan, Manuela', 'Ottmann, Christian']","['Molzan M', 'Ottmann C']","['Chemical Genomics Centre of the Max-Planck-Society, Otto-Hahn-Strasse 15, 44227 Dortmund, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121227,England,Cell Mol Biol Lett,Cellular & molecular biology letters,9607427,"['0 (14-3-3 Proteins)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MLF1 protein, human)', '0 (Mutant Chimeric Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']",IM,,"['14-3-3 Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Active Transport, Cell Nucleus', 'Animals', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Nucleus/genetics/*metabolism', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Molecular Imaging', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Mutant Chimeric Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Plasmids', 'Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transfection']",PMC6275728,,2012/12/29 06:00,2013/06/01 06:00,['2012/12/29 06:00'],"['2012/09/07 00:00 [received]', '2012/12/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/12/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/12/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.2478/s11658-012-0044-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Mol Biol Lett. 2013 Mar;18(1):137-48. doi: 10.2478/s11658-012-0044-1.

We describe here the case of a 59-year-old man with acute myeloid leukemia who developed CMV meningoencephalitis after cord blood transplantation. The patient presented with a sudden onset of neurological symptoms, such as convulsion, on day 37. The analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sample revealed an increase in the number of cells, which were of donor (cord blood) origin, consisting mainly of T cells. No bacteria were detected in the CSF sample. Real-time PCR analysis revealed that the CSF sample was positive for CMV, but was negative for HHV-6, adenovirus, or BK virus. The patient was diagnosed with CMV meningoencephalitis and received cidofovir. His neurological symptoms were gradually improved and completely disappeared by day 60. CMV-specific dextramer-positive CD8(+) T cells were detected in the peripheral blood and CSF samples, with the frequency being much higher in the CSF. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the appearance of CMV-specific T cells in CSF samples from a patient with CMV meningoencephalitis.

Several studies have demonstrated that UVB-induced cell death occurs through the generation of reactive oxygen species. The consequent oxidative stress includes the impairment of cellular antioxidants, the induction of DNA damage and the occurrence of apoptosis. In this review, we investigated UVB apoptotic action in various cell models by using ultrastructural, molecular and cytofluorimetric techniques. Myeloid leukemia HL-60, T-lymphoblastoid Molt-4 and myelomonocytic U937 human cells, generally affected by apoptotic stimuli, were studied. Human chondrocytes and C2C12 skeletal muscle cells, known to be more resistant to damage, were also considered. All of them, when exposed to UVB radiation, revealed a number of characteristic apoptotic markers. Membrane blebbing, cytoplasm shrinkage and chromatin condensation were detected by means of electron microscopy. DNA cleavage, investigated by using agarose gel electrophoresis and TUNEL reaction, was observed in suspended cells. Differently, in chondrocytes and in skeletal muscle cells, oligonucleosomic DNA fragmentation did not appear, even if a certain TUNEL positivity was detected.

A number of mutations of the BCR-ABL gene have been identified and are associated with TKI resistance. Patients may benefit from switching to a second-line TKI, undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplant, or receiving newly emerging agents.

We tested the effectiveness of a purine analog-based reduced-intensity conditioning combination in patients undergoing allogeneic SCT for bone marrow aplasia. Patients with severe marrow aplasia who had a tissue-compatible sibling donor were conditioned with fludarabine 30 mg/m(2) for 5 days and cyclophosphamide 120 mg/kg. Stem cells from HLA-identical sibling donors were mobilized with filgrastim, and the harvested blood concentrates were incubated ex vivo with alemtuzumab. After graft infusion, patients received therapeutic doses of cyclosporine up to day 90. The primary objective of this study was to examine the proportion of patients who achieved engraftment and overall survival. Secondary objectives were the rates of graft-versus-host disease, posttransplantation infections, and graft failure. The study group comprised 30 patients who received a total of 31 cytokine-mobilized blood stem cell transplantations. The median CD34(+) cell dose infused was 4.99 x 10(6)/kg. All patients engrafted at a median of 12 days post-SCT. Two patients exhibited delayed graft failure, at 3 months and 7 months post-SCT, and required retransplantation or donor lymphocyte infusion to reestablish full-donor chimerism. At a median of 1,560 days post-SCT, all patients survived and were transfusion-free. We confirm that the combination of purine analog and cyclophosphamide is adequate for engraftment of grafts immunodepleted with alemtuzumab.

Pre-mRNA is spliced by the spliceosome consisting of large complexes of small nuclear RNA (snRNA) and protein subunits. Spliceosome gene mutations were detected in 40-80% of patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), particularly in those with ringed sideroblasts. Recently, two large whole-genome sequencing studies identified mutations in the spliceosome gene SF3B1 in approximately 10% of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Intrigued by these findings, we performed a pathway enrichment analysis and found that, unlike in MDS, in CLL spliceosome mutations exist almost exclusively in SF3B1. Patients with CLL with an SF3B1 gene mutation are characterized by a short progression-free survival and a low 10-year survival rate. Furthermore, the frequency of SF3B1 mutations is significantly higher in chemotherapy treated than in untreated patients with CLL, suggesting that chemotherapy induces SF3B1 gene mutations or selects a population of mutated cells. Whether SF3B1 gene mutations have a role in leukemogenesis, either because of altered splicing or other splicing-unrelated functions such as ectopic expression of Homeobox (Hox) genes previously reported in SF3B1+(/-) mice, remains to be determined.",,"['Rozovski, Uri', 'Keating, Michael', 'Estrov, Zeev']","['Rozovski U', 'Keating M', 'Estrov Z']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20130110,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,IM,,"['Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/metabolism', '*Mutation', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/genetics/metabolism', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA Splicing', 'Spliceosomes/*genetics/metabolism']",PMC4176818,['NIHMS629669'],2012/12/29 06:00,2014/02/11 06:00,['2012/12/29 06:00'],"['2012/12/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/12/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2012.742528 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2013 Jul;54(7):1364-6. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2012.742528.

We combined lenalidomide with rituximab to improve response rates in patients with relapsed or refractory CLL. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-nine adult patients (age 42 to 82 years) with relapsed or refractory CLL were enrolled onto a phase II study of lenalidomide and rituximab. Patients had received prior fludarabine-based therapy or chemoimmunotherapy. Rituximab (375 mg/m(2) intravenously) was administered weekly during cycle one and on day 1 of cycles three to 12. Lenalidomide was started on day 9 of cycle one at 10 mg orally and administered daily continuously. Each cycle was 28 days. Rituximab was administered for 12 cycles; lenalidomide could continue indefinitely if patients benefitted clinically. RESULTS: The overall response rate was 66%, including 12% complete responses and 12% nodular partial remissions. Time to treatment failure was 17.4 months. Median overall survival has not been reached; estimated survival at 36 months is 71%. The most common grade 3 or 4 toxicity was neutropenia (73% of patients). Fourteen patients (24%) experienced a grade 3 to 4 infection or febrile episode. There was one episode of grade 3 tumor lysis; one patient experienced renal failure during the first cycle of therapy, and one venous thromboembolic event occurred during the study. CONCLUSION: The combination of lenalidomide and rituximab is active in patients with recurrent CLL and warrants further investigation.",,"['Badoux, Xavier C', 'Keating, Michael J', 'Wen, Sijin', 'Wierda, William G', ""O'Brien, Susan M"", 'Faderl, Stefan', 'Sargent, Rachel', 'Burger, Jan A', 'Ferrajoli, Alessandra']","['Badoux XC', 'Keating MJ', 'Wen S', 'Wierda WG', ""O'Brien SM"", 'Faderl S', 'Sargent R', 'Burger JA', 'Ferrajoli A']","['The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],['P01 CA081534/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121226,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Immunologic Factors)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', '4Z8R6ORS6L (Thalidomide)', 'F0P408N6V4 (Lenalidomide)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Fever/etiology', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Factors/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Infections/complications/immunology', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Lenalidomide', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Recurrence', 'Rituximab', 'Salvage Therapy/*methods', 'Thalidomide/administration & dosage/adverse effects/analogs & derivatives', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",PMC4878047,,2012/12/28 06:00,2013/03/30 06:00,['2012/12/28 06:00'],"['2012/12/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/12/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/30 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2012.42.8623 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2012.42.8623 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2013 Feb 10;31(5):584-91. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2012.42.8623.

FeLV subgroup A (FeLV-A) is transmitted in natural infections, and FeLV subgroups B, C, and T can evolve directly from FeLV-A by mutation and/or recombination with endogenous retroviruses in domestic cats, resulting in a variety of pathogenic outcomes. The cell surface entry receptor for FeLV-A is a putative thiamine transporter (THTR1). Here, we have addressed whether FeLV-A infection might disrupt thiamine uptake into cells and, because thiamine is an essential nutrient, whether this disruption might have pathological consequences. First, we cloned the cat ortholog of the other of the two known thiamine transporters in mammals, THTR2, and we show that feline THTR1 (feTHTR1) and feTHTR2 both mediate thiamine uptake, but feTHTR2 does not function as a receptor for FeLV-A. We found that feTHTR1 is widely expressed in cat tissues and in cell lines, while expression of feTHTR2 is restricted. Thiamine uptake mediated by feTHTR1 was indeed blocked by FeLV-A infection, and in feline fibroblasts that naturally express feTHTR1 and not feTHTR2, this blockade resulted in a growth arrest at physiological concentrations of extracellular thiamine. The growth arrest was reversed at high extracellular concentrations of thiamine. Our results show that FeLV-A infection can indeed disrupt thiamine uptake with pathological consequences. A prediction of these experiments is that raising the plasma levels of thiamine in FeLV-infected cats may ameliorate the pathogenic effects of infection.",,"['Mendoza, Ramon', 'Miller, A Dusty', 'Overbaugh, Julie']","['Mendoza R', 'Miller AD', 'Overbaugh J']","['Human Biology Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA051080/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA009229/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA51080/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32CA09229/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121226,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Membrane Transport Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', 'X66NSO3N35 (Thiamine)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Biological Transport', 'Cats', 'Cell Line', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/genetics/*physiology', 'Membrane Transport Proteins/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Receptors, Virus/genetics/*metabolism', 'Retroviridae Infections/virology', 'Thiamine/*metabolism', 'Tumor Virus Infections/virology', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Virus Attachment', 'Virus Internalization']",PMC3571393,,2012/12/28 06:00,2013/04/25 06:00,['2012/12/28 06:00'],"['2012/12/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/12/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/25 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.03203-12 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.03203-12 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2013 Mar;87(5):2412-9. doi: 10.1128/JVI.03203-12.

We hypothesized that two BCL2 family proteins, BCL2 and MCL1, may be responsible for regulating neonatal oocyte survival. Previous work has shown that BCL2 is important for germ cell survival in adult mouse ovaries, but no work has been done to examine its role at the time of birth. To elucidate the effects of BCL2 in the neonatal ovary, we examined ovaries of both Bcl2-overexpressing and knockout transgenic mice. When compared to wild-type mice, neither Bcl2 overexpression nor abrogation significantly altered ovarian histology. Another BCL2 family protein, MCL1, is expressed in human oocytes during ovarian development, suggesting a role for MCL1 in oocyte survival. To test this, we first examined the expression of MCL1 in the newborn mouse ovary. MCL1 was localized to both oocytes and somatic cells during primordial follicle formation. Subsequently, we used an in vitro organ culture system to identify a role for MCL1 in oocyte survival. We found that inhibition of MCL1 with an antibody to MCL1 in culture resulted in a reduced number of germ cells and an increase in cyst breakdown. Our data demonstrate that while BCL2 is not likely involved in perinatal oocyte survival, MCL1 may be an important regulator of the ovarian primordial follicle reserve.",,"['Jones, Robin L', 'Pepling, Melissa E']","['Jones RL', 'Pepling ME']","['Department of Biology, Syracuse University, Syracuse, NY 13244, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20130221,United States,Biol Reprod,Biology of reproduction,0207224,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '114100-40-2 (Bcl2 protein, mouse)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn/*physiology', 'Antibodies/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/physiology', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/*physiology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/physiology', 'Female', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Oocytes/cytology/drug effects/physiology', 'Organ Culture Techniques', 'Ovarian Follicle/cytology/drug effects/physiology', 'Ovary/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/antagonists & inhibitors/deficiency/drug effects/genetics/*physiology']",,,2012/12/28 06:00,2013/08/13 06:00,['2012/12/28 06:00'],"['2012/12/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/12/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/13 06:00 [medline]']","['biolreprod.112.103028 [pii]', '10.1095/biolreprod.112.103028 [doi]']",epublish,Biol Reprod. 2013 Feb 21;88(2):46. doi: 10.1095/biolreprod.112.103028.

This chromosomal translocation results in the fusion between the 5' part of the BCR gene, normally located on chromosome 22, and the 3' part of the ABL gene on chromosome 9 giving origin to a BCR-ABL fusion gene which is transcribed and then translated into a hybrid protein. In general, three breakpoint cluster regions in the BCR gene have been described: major (M-BCR), minor (m-BCR) and micro (mu-BCR). Three main variants of the BCR-ABL gene have been described depending on the length of the sequence of the BCR gene included that encode for the P190, P210, P230 proteins. Most patients (95 %) were found to have P210 protein that resulted from rearrangement in the M-BCR region in the BCR gene and thus gives rise to b2a2 or b3a2 variants. The incidence of one or other rearrangement in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients varies in different reported series. These two variants are associated with distinct clinical types of human leukemias. In this study, we report the frequencies of M-BCR-ABL fusion transcripts in 44 CML patients and we review the data on the correlations between the type of M-BCR/ABL variant and the corresponding sex, age and biological features. Forty-four untreated chronic phase CML patients were studied. The type of BCR-ABL fusion transcripts was determined by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). More than half of them showed b3a2 fusion transcript (64 %), while (36 %) showed b2a2 transcript. No patients coexpressed b3a2/b2a2. Correlation between biological data demonstrated that: (a) M-BCR rearrangements were not associated with the sex of the patients. (b) Patients with b3a2 rearrangements were older than patients with b2a2 transcripts. (c) M-BCR rearrangements were influenced neither by the white blood count (WBC) nor with hemoglobin levels. However, platelet level is more elevated in patients with b3a2 transcript (681.2/L vs. 207/L; P = 0.001).

Mature granulocytes show lobular structure of cell nuclei with highly condensed chromatin in which HP1 proteins are replaced by MNEI. These structural features of chromatin correspond to low level of gene expression and the loss of some important functions as DNA damage repair, shown in this work and, on the other hand, acquisition of a new specific function consisting in the release of chromatin extracellular traps in response to infection by pathogenic microbes. Granulocytic differentiation is incomplete in myeloid leukemia and is manifested by persistence of lower levels of HP1gamma and HP1beta isoforms. This immaturity is accompanied by acquisition of DDR capacity allowing to these incompletely differentiated multi-lobed neutrophils of AML patients to respond to induction of DSB by gamma-irradiation. Immature granulocytes persist frequently in blood of treated AML patients in remission. These granulocytes contrary to mature ones do not release chromatin for NETs after activation with phorbol myristate-12 acetate-13 and do not exert the neutrophil function in immune defence. We suggest therefore the detection of HP1 expression in granulocytes of AML patients as a very sensitive indicator of their maturation and functionality after the treatment.

Here, we show in mouse that genetic inactivation of Smchd1 accelerates tumorigenesis in male mice. Loss of Smchd1 in transformed mouse embryonic fibroblasts increased tumor growth upon transplantation into immunodeficient nude mice. In addition, loss of Smchd1 in Emu-Myc transgenic mice that undergo lymphomagenesis reduced disease latency by 50% relative to control animals. In premalignant Emu-Myc transgenic mice deficient in Smchd1, there was an increase in the number of pre-B cells in the periphery, likely accounting for the accelerated disease in these animals. Global gene expression profiling suggested that Smchd1 normally represses genes activated by MLL chimeric fusion proteins in leukemia, implying that Smchd1 loss may work through the same pathways as overexpressed MLL fusion proteins do in leukemia and lymphoma. Notably, we found that SMCHD1 is underexpressed in many types of human hematopoietic malignancy.

METHODS: K562 cells were cultured in the presence of 1 micromol/L RA for varying lengths of time, and gamma-globin mRNA expression and hemoglobin content in the cells were detected by real-time PCR (RT-PCR) and ultraviolet spectrophotometry, respectively, to evaluate the erythroid differentiation of K562 cells. RT-PCR and Western blotting were used to examine AQP1 expression in the cells following RA treatment. A retroviral expression vector of AQP1 small interfering RNA (pSUPER-retro-puro-shAQP1) was constructed and transfected into K562 cells to establish a K562 cell line with stable AQP1 down-regulation (K562-shAQP1), in which the changes in gamma-globin and hemoglobin expressions after RA treatment were detected. RESULTS: RA treatment significantly increased gamma-globin and hemoglobin expressions in K562 cells (P<0.01), causing also significantly enhanced AQP1 mRNA and protein expressions over time (P<0.01). Transfection with the recombinant plasmids pSuper-retro-puro-shAQP1 resulted in stable AQP1 suppression in K562 cells (P<0.01), which showed markedly reduced gamma-globin and hemoglobin expressions after RA induction as compared to the control K562 cells (P<0.01).

Both LIF and IL-6 [in the absence of soluble IL-6 receptor (sIL-6Ralpha)] activated Erk1/2, JNK1/2, p38-MAPK and PI3K signalling peaking at 20min and induced cytoprotection against simulated ischemia-reperfusion injury which was blocked by the MEK1/2 inhibitor PD98059 but not the p38-MAPK inhibitor SB203580. In the absence of sIL-6R, IL-6 did not induce STAT1/3 phosphorylation, whereas IL-6/sIL-6R and LIF induced STAT1 and STAT3 phosphorylation. Furthermore, IL-6/sIL-6R induced phosphorylation of STAT1 Tyr(701) and STAT3 Tyr(705) were enhanced by SB203580. IL-6 and pheneylephrine (PE), but not LIF, induced cardiomyocyte iNOS expression and nitric oxide (NO) production. IL-6, LIF and PE induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, but with phenotypic differences in ANF and SERCA2 expression and myofilament organisation with IL-6 more resembling PE than LIF. Transfection of cardiomyocytes with full length or truncated chimaeric gp130 cytoplasmic domain/Erythropoietin receptor (EpoR) extracellular domain fusion constructs showed that the membrane proximal Box 1 and Box 2 containing region of gp130 was necessary and sufficient for MAPK and PI3K activation; hypertrophy; SERCA2 expression and iNOS/NO induction in the absence of JAK/STAT activation. In conclusion, IL-6 can signal in cardiomyocytes independent of sIL-6R and STAT1/3 and furthermore, that Erk1/2 and PI3K activation by IL-6 are both necessary and sufficient for induced cardioprotection.

TW-92 exhibited relatively high selectivity towards primary Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) cells, as compared to normal mononuclear cells. In view of the selectivity of this family of naphthoquinones, novel chloroaminophenylnaphthoquinone isomers with different methyl substitutions on the phenyl ring were synthesized, and their effect on leukemia cells was tested. These compounds induced cell death in U937 human myeloid leukemia cells, which was prominent following 48 h of culture. Structure-activity relationship studies revealed that TW-74, a novel chloronaphthoquinone with a methyl group at the meta (m) position, was the most active derivative in inducing apoptosis. The mechanism underlying cell death induction by TW-74 was further investigated in U937 cells, a monocytic cell line which serves as a sensitive model of apoptosis induction. TW-74 induced rapid activation of Mitogen Activated Protein Kinases (MAPKs). It caused swelling of isolated rat liver mitochondria and an early reduction of mitochondrial membrane potential in intact cells, indicative of a direct effect on mitochondria. Apoptosis induced by TW-74 was accompanied by cytochrome C release and caspase activation. TW-74 induced down- regulation of (BCL2), an anti-apoptotic protein. Furthermore, TW-74 induced selective dose-dependent cell death in primary B-Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) cells.

High-throughput gene expression profiling has been used to infer statistical models describing these cellular programs, and development is now needed to guide orientated modulation of these systems. Here we develop a regression-based model to reverse-engineer a temporal genetic program, based on relevant patterns of gene expression after cell stimulation. This method integrates the temporal dimension of biological rewiring of genetic programs and enables the prediction of the effect of targeted gene disruption at the system level. We tested the performance accuracy of this model on synthetic data before reverse-engineering the response of primary cancer cells to a proliferative (protumorigenic) stimulation in a multistate leukemia biological model (i.e., chronic lymphocytic leukemia). To validate the ability of our method to predict the effects of gene modulation on the global program, we performed an intervention experiment on a targeted gene.

An alternative approach proposed by Moodie et al. is to use the survival probabilities of the included studies, all collected at a single point in time: the intervention effect is then summarised as the pooled ratio of the logarithm of survival probabilities (which is an estimator of the hazard ratios when hazards are proportional). In this article, we propose a generalization of this method. By using survival probabilities at several points in time, this generalization allows a flexible modeling of the intervention over time. The method is applicable to partially proportional hazards models, with the advantage of not requiring the specification of the baseline survival. As in Moodie et al.'s method, the study-level factors modifying the survival functions can be ignored as long as they do not modify the intervention effect. The procedures of estimation are presented for fixed and random effects models.

METHODS AND RESULTS: The signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) was activated in collagen-stimulated platelets. Activated STAT3 served as a protein scaffold to facilitate the catalytic interaction between the kinase Syk (spleen tyrosine kinase) and the substrate PLCgamma2 to enhance collagen-induced calcium mobilization and platelet activation. The same interaction of STAT3 with Syk and PLCgamma2 was detected in HEK293 cells transfected with cDNAs for Syk and PLCgamma2 and stimulated with interleukin-6. Pharmacological inhibition of STAT3 blocked approximately 50% of collagen- and a collagen-related peptide-induced but not thrombin receptor-activating peptide- or ADP-induced aggregation and approximately 80% of thrombus formation of human platelets on a collagen matrix. This in vitro phenotype was reproduced in mice infused with STAT3 inhibitors and mice with platelet-specific STAT3 deficiency. By forming a complex with its soluble receptor, the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 enhanced the collagen-induced STAT3 activation in human platelets. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate a nontranscriptional activity of STAT3 that facilitates a crosstalk between proinflammatory cytokine and hemostasis/thrombosis signals in platelets. This crosstalk may be responsible for the platelet hyperactivity found in conditions of inflammation.",,"['Zhou, Zhou', 'Gushiken, Francisca C', 'Bolgiano, Doug', 'Salsbery, Breia J', 'Aghakasiri, Niloufar', 'Jing, Naijie', 'Wu, Xiaoping', 'Vijayan, K Vinod', 'Rumbaut, Rolando E', 'Adachi, Roberto', 'Lopez, Jose A', 'Dong, Jing-Fei']","['Zhou Z', 'Gushiken FC', 'Bolgiano D', 'Salsbery BJ', 'Aghakasiri N', 'Jing N', 'Wu X', 'Vijayan KV', 'Rumbaut RE', 'Adachi R', 'Lopez JA', 'Dong JF']","['Puget Sound Blood Research Institute, Seattle, WA.', 'Department of Leukemia, the University of Texas M.

We report that embryo-derived PreImplantation Factor (PIF) plays a determining role in developing maternal/host tolerance toward the semiallogeneic or total allogeneic embryo and in regulating systemic immune response. Synthetic PIF treatment has proven effective in preventing immune attacks in nonpregnant models of autoimmunity. In this study, we tested the capability of PIF to prevent the development of acute GVHD in semiallogeneic or totally allogeneic murine BMT models. We examined the regulatory effect of PIF both in vivo and in vitro to control deleterious GVHD while maintaining its ability to preserve the beneficial graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect. Bone marrow and spleen cells from C57BL/6 donors were transplanted in semiallogeneic (C57BL/6xBALB/c) F1 or allogeneic (BALB/c) mice, which were then treated with PIF 1 mg/kg/day for 2 weeks. Short-term PIF administration reduced acute GVHD in both models and increased survival for up to 4 months after semiallogeneic or totally allogeneic BMT. This effect was coupled with decreased skin inflammation (semiallogeneic model) and decreased liver inflammation (both models), as well as reduced colon ulceration (allogeneic model). GVHD-associated cytokine and chemokine gene expression were decreased in the liver. PIF further lowered circulating IL-17 levels, but not IFN-gamma levels. Both in vivo and in vitro, PIF treatment was demonstrated to lead to decreased inducible nitric oxide synthase expression and decreased lipopolysaccharide-activated macrophages to lower nitric oxide secretion. Significantly, PIF did not diminish the beneficial GVL effect in the B cell leukemia model. PIF acts primarily by inducing the regulatory phenotype on monocytes/antigen-presenting cells, which controls T cell proliferation. Overall, our data demonstrate that PIF protects against semiallogeneic and allogeneic GVHD long term by reducing both target organ and systemic inflammation and by decreasing oxidative stress, while preserving the beneficial GVL effect.","['Copyright (c) 2013 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

The purpose of this study was to provide a better understanding of the epidemiology of APL-related thrombosis as a first step towards developing preventive strategies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We report a rare case of catastrophic acute myocardial infarction in a patient with APL while she developed the all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) syndrome. We describe the pathogenesis of APL-related thrombosis and review all previously reported cases of major thromboses in APL. RESULTS: We found 94 cases of major thromboses in patients with APL. Both genders were almost equally affected. More than 80% of events occurred before or during induction therapy with deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism (DVT/PE), cardiac events, and cerebrovascular accidents (CVA) constituting more than 75% of all cases. Arterial events were slightly more common than venous events. Only 2 arterial events occurred after completion of induction therapy. Thrombosis was associated with life-threatening hemorrhage in about 15%, significant coagulative defects in about 50%, and ATRA syndrome in about 13% of cases. Cardiac thrombotic events, DVT/PE, and CVA were associated with ATRA syndrome in 24%, 4.5%, and 5% of cases, respectively (p=0.09). None of the observed trends and associations reached statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS: This review advances our understanding of the epidemiology of major thromboses in APL.

The few currently available drug treatments are dated and face problems with toxicity and resistance. For these reasons, there is an urgent need for the development of new chemotherapies for the treatment of sleeping sickness. In this study, we investigated the trypanocidal activity of bitter melon extract. Recently, it has been shown that bitter melon extracts display cytotoxic activity towards different cancer cell lines. However, agents exhibiting anti-tumour activity are usually also inhibiting the growth of T. brucei. Treatment of bloodstream forms of T. brucei with extracts prepared from Chinese and Indian bitter melon varieties resulted in a decrease in cell proliferation. In contrast, human myeloid leukaemia HL-60 cells were 3-6 times less sensitive to the extracts than trypanosomes. Initial fractionation of bitter melon extracts indicated that the trypanocidal activity of the extract is associated with at least two different classes of substances: one class of larger molecular weight compounds (>3 kDa) causing rapid lysis of trypanosomes and one class of smaller molecular weight compounds (<3 kDa) inducing accumulation of the parasites in the G(2)-M phase of the cell cycle. Together, the results suggest that bitter melon is a promising source for trypanocidal agents which could be used as lead compounds for the development of novel anti-sleeping sickness drugs.",['Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

There is evidence for an inhibitory effect of benzodiazepines on mast cell mediated symptoms in patients with systemic mast cell activation disease. Therefore, we investigated the effects of benzodiazepines on adenosine A(2B) receptor mediated interleukin-8 production in human mast cell leukaemia (HMC1) cells by an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. The adenosine analogue N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine (NECA, 0.3-3 muM) increased interleukin-8 production about 5-fold above baseline. This effect was attenuated by the adenosine A(2B) receptor antagonist MRS1754 (N-(4-cyanophenyl)-2-{4-(2,3,6,7-tetrahydro-2,6-dioxo-1,3-dipropyl-1H-purin-8-yl) phenoxy}-acetamide) 1 muM. In addition, diazepam, 4'-chlorodiazepam and flunitrazepam (1-30 muM) markedly reduced NECA-induced interleukin-8 production in that order of potency, whereas clonazepam showed only a modest inhibition. The inhibitory effect of diazepam was not altered by flumazenil 10 muM or PK11195 (1-(2-chlorophenyl)-N-methyl-N-(1-methylpropyl)-3-isoquinolinecarboxamide) 10 muM. Diazepam attenuated the NECA-induced expression of mRNA encoding for interleukin-8. Moreover, diazepam and flunitrazepam reduced the increasing effects of NECA on cAMP-response element- and nuclear factor of activated t-cells-driven luciferase reporter gene activities in HMC1 cells. Neither diazepam nor flunitrazepam affected NECA-induced increases in cellular cAMP levels in CHO Flp-In cells stably expressing recombinant human adenosine A(2B) receptors, excluding a direct action of benzodiazepines on human adenosine A(2B) receptors. In conclusion, this is the first study showing an inhibitory action of benzodiazepines on adenosine A(2B) receptor mediated interleukin-8 production in human mast (HMC1) cells.

To provide new insight into this relationship, particularly at the extremes (<1500 and > 4500 g), we pooled data from three of the largest childhood cancer case-control studies ever conducted. METHODS: Birthweight and gestational age on 4075 children with ALL and 12,065 controls were collected during the course of three studies conducted in the USA, the UK and Germany in the 1990s. Information was obtained from mothers at interview, and the impact of bias was evaluated using the UK study which accessed birth registrations of participants and non-participants. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using unconditional logistic regression models. RESULTS: Children with ALL were, on average, heavier than controls at all gestations, the disparity being driven by a deficit of low-birthweight at all gestations and an excess of high-birthweight at >/= 40 weeks. Overall, a 1.2 (95% CI 1.1-1.3) increase in ALL risk per kg increase in birthweight was observed; the ORs rising from 0.2 (0.1-0.7) at </= 1500 g through to 1.2 (0.9-1.6) at >/= 4500 g; and 0.8 (0.7-0.9) <10th centile through to 1.3 (1.1-1.4) >/= 90th centile. CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate the importance of looking across the full birthweight spectrum when examining associations with disease risk. The new observation of a deficit of very-low-birthweight cases at all gestations has aetiological and study design implications for future work examining not only the in utero origins of ALL, but also other childhood and adult cancers.",['Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Studies examining the effect of PTM on outcomes after lung transplantation (LTx) or orthotopic heart transplantation (OHT) are limited. We evaluated the effect of PTM on outcomes after LTx and OHT. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed primary adult LTx and OHT recipients in the United Network for Organ Sharing database. Primary stratification was by PTM and secondary stratification by tumor type. Matched cohorts (2:1) and multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to evaluate mortality. RESULTS: From 2000 to 2011, 13,613 adults underwent LTx and 19,817 underwent OHT. PTM was present in 740 LTx patients (5.4%) and in 1,117 OHT patients (5.6%). On unadjusted analysis, LTx patients and OHT patients with PTM had similar 30-day, 1-year, and 5-year survivals (p<0.05) compared with patients with no PTM. These findings persisted after risk-adjustment . No tumor types were associated with increased mortality in LTx patients. OHT patients with leukemia, lymphoma, or myeloma (LLM) had a significant increase in univariate mortality at 30 days (hazard ratio [HR], 1.82; p = 0.04), 1 year (HR, 1.93; p<0.001), and 5 years (HR, 1.54; p = 0.01). Matched cohort analysis revealed comparable outcomes in LTx patients but confirmed increased univariate 1-year mortality (HR, 1.89; p = 0.006) in OHT patients with LLM. CONCLUSIONS: This large study evaluating the effects of PTM found the incidence of PTM was in LTx 5.4% and in OHT 5.6%.

Because a recent genome-wide methylation analysis of CLL cells suggested that demethylation therapy might be beneficial in CLL, we conducted a phase II trial with the hypomethylating agent azacitidine in patients with recurrent fludarabine-refractory CLL. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Nine patients with recurrent fludarabine-refractory Rai stage IV CLL (median age, 74 years; range, 49-81 years) were enrolled. Azacitidine (75 mg/m(2)) was administered by subcutaneous injection daily for 7 consecutive days every 3 to 8 weeks, and the data were analyzed at a median follow-up of 9 months (range 3-47 months). RESULTS: The trial was prematurely discontinued because of lack of response and slow accrual. The number of cycles administered ranged from 1 to 6. Three patients received 1 cycle, 3 patients received 2 cycles, and the remaining 3 patients received 4, 5, or 6 cycles. Side effects included grade 2 or 3 infectious episodes (resulting from immunosuppression and drug-induced neutropenia), diarrhea, rash, vomiting, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. One patient experienced reduction of hepatosplenomegaly and a substantial increase in platelet count after 4 cycles of therapy. However this response did not qualify as a partial response according to the National Cancer Institute International Workshop on CLL (NCI-IWCLL) criteria. At a median follow-up of 9 months after the start of azacitidine treatment, 3 patients (33%) who went on to receive other treatments were alive. CONCLUSIONS: Although no partial or complete responses occurred in these heavily pretreated patients, the encouraging response in 1 of these patients may warrant further studies to investigate the effects of azacitidine in CLL.",['Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

The aim was to develop a reliable tool to identify patients with an intermediate risk relapse who are in need of haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). METHODS: Included were 80 children and adolescents with first intermediate risk BM relapse of ALL recruited in trial ALL-REZ BFM P95/96. We assessed the prognostic value of minimal residual disease (MRD) after induction therapy quantified by PCR using leukaemia clone-specific T-cell receptor/immunoglobulin gene rearrangements. RESULTS: Molecular good responders (MRD < 10(-3), n=46) had a probability of event-free survival (pEFS) at 10 years of 76% standard error (SE) +/- 6% and a cumulative incidence of second relapse (CIR) at 10 years of 21% SE +/- 6%; pEFS of molecular poor responders (MRD >/= 10(-3), n=34) at 10 years was 18% SE +/- 7% and CIR 61% SE +/- 9% (p<0.001). Cox regression analysis revealed MRD after induction to be the strongest independent prognostic parameter with a 6.6-fold increased risk (95% confidence interval 3.3-13.5, p<0.001) for molecular poor responders to suffer a subsequent adverse event compared to good responders. CONCLUSION: In patients with intermediate risk BM relapse of ALL, low MRD after induction is associated with an excellent long-term prognosis with conventional chemo-/radiotherapy whereas patients with insufficient response have an extremely poor prognosis. Therefore, in the subsequent trial ALL-REZ BFM 2002, MRD is used to allocate molecular good responders to conventional post-induction therapy and molecular poor responders to allogeneic HSCT.",['Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

PCa is strongly age associated; low death rates in surveillance cohorts call into question the widespread use of surgery, which leads to overtreatment and a reduction in quality of life. There is a great need to increase the understanding of tumor characteristics in the context of disease progression. OBJECTIVE: To perform the first multigenome investigation of PCa through analysis of both autosomal and mitochondrial DNA, and to integrate exome sequencing data, and RNA sequencing and copy-number alteration (CNA) data to investigate how various different tumor characteristics, commonly analyzed separately, are interconnected. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Exome sequencing was applied to 64 tumor samples from 55 PCa patients with varying stage and grade. Integrated analysis was performed on a core set of 50 tumors from which exome sequencing, CNA, and RNA sequencing data were available. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Genes, mutated at a significantly higher rate relative to a genomic background, were identified. In addition, mitochondrial and autosomal mutation rates were correlated to CNAs and proliferation, assessed as a cell cycle gene expression signature. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Genes not previously reported to be significantly mutated in PCa, such as cell division cycle 27 homolog (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) (CDC27), myeloid/lymphoid or mixed-lineage leukemia 3 (MLL3), lysine (K)-specific demethylase 6A (KDM6A), and kinesin family member 5A (KIF5A) were identified. The mutation rate in the mitochondrial genome was 55 times higher than that of the autosomes. Multilevel analysis demonstrated a tight correlation between high reactive-oxygen exposure, chromosomal damage, high proliferation, and in parallel, a transition from multiclonal indolent primary PCa to monoclonal aggressive disease. As we only performed targeted sequence analysis; copy-number neutral rearrangements recently described for PCa were not accounted for. CONCLUSIONS: The mitochondrial genome displays an elevated mutation rate compared to the autosomal chromosomes. By integrated analysis, we demonstrated that different tumor characteristics are interconnected, providing an increased understanding of PCa etiology.","['Copyright (c) 2012 European Association of Urology.

FLT3 ITD is a constitutively active tyrosine kinase that drives the activation of STAT5, leading to the growth and survival of AML cells. Although there has been some success in identifying tyrosine kinase inhibitors that block the function of FLT3 ITD, there remains a continued need for effective treatment of this disease. We have identified the psychotropic drug pimozide as an effective inhibitor of STAT5 function. Pimozide inhibits the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5, leading to the death of AML cells through the induction of apoptosis. Pimozide shows a combinatorial effect with the tyrosine kinase inhibitors midostaurin (PKC412) and sunitinib in the inhibition of STAT5 tyrosine phosphorylation and the induction of apoptosis. Significantly, pimozide reduces the tumor burden in a mouse model of FLT3-driven AML.

Most of the transcripts regulated by all-trans retinoic acid (RA) in ES cells are dependent upon functional RARgamma signaling. Notably, many of these RA-RARgamma target genes are implicated in retinoid uptake and metabolism. For instance, Lrat (lecithin:retinol acyltransferase), Stra6 (stimulated by retinoic acid 6), Crabp2 (cellular retinoic acid binding protein 2), and Cyp26a1 (cytochrome p450 26a1) transcripts are induced in wild type (WT), but not in RARgamma(-/-) cells. Transcripts for the transcription factors Pbx1 (pre-B cell leukemia homeobox-1), Wt1 (Wilm's tumor gene-1), and Meis1 (myeloid ecotropic viral integration site-1) increase upon RA treatment of WT, but not RARgamma(-/-) cells. In contrast, Stra8, Dleu7, Leftb, Pitx2, and Cdx1 mRNAs are induced by RA even in the absence of RARgamma. Mapping of the epigenetic signature of Meis1 revealed that RA induces a rapid increase in the H3K9/K14ac epigenetic mark at the proximal promoter and at two sites downstream of the transcription start site in WT, but not in RARgamma(-/-) cells. Thus, RA-associated increases in H3K9/K14ac epigenetic marks require RARgamma and are associated with increased Meis1 transcript levels, whereas H3K4me3 is present at the Meis1 proximal promoter even in the absence of RARgamma. In contrast, at the Lrat proximal promoter primarily the H3K4me3 mark, and not the H3K9/K14ac mark, increases in response to RA, independently of the presence of RARgamma. Our data show major epigenetic changes associated with addition of the RARgamma agonist RA in ES cells.",,"['Kashyap, Vasundhra', 'Laursen, Kristian B', 'Brenet, Fabienne', 'Viale, Agnes J', 'Scandura, Joseph M', 'Gudas, Lorraine J']","['Kashyap V', 'Laursen KB', 'Brenet F', 'Viale AJ', 'Scandura JM', 'Gudas LJ']","['Department of Pharmacology, Weill Medical College of Cornell University, 1300 York Avenue, New York, NY 10065, USA.']",['eng'],['R01 CA043796/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121221,England,J Cell Sci,Journal of cell science,0052457,"['0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (retinoic acid receptor gamma)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,,"['Cells, Cultured', 'Chromatin Assembly and Disassembly/*drug effects/genetics', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*drug effects/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation/drug effects/genetics', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology']",PMC3625813,,2012/12/25 06:00,2013/11/20 06:00,['2012/12/25 06:00'],"['2012/12/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/12/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/20 06:00 [medline]']","['jcs.119701 [pii]', '10.1242/jcs.119701 [doi]']",ppublish,J Cell Sci. 2013 Feb 15;126(Pt 4):999-1008. doi: 10.1242/jcs.119701.

Parthenolide (PTL) has been shown to cause apoptosis of LIC in acute myeloid leukemia. In the present study, we assessed the effects of PTL on LIC populations in childhood ALL. Apoptosis assays demonstrated that PTL was effective against bulk B- and T-ALL cells, whereas the CD34(+)/CD19(-), CD34(+)/CD7(-), and CD34(-) subpopulations were more resistant. However, functional analyses revealed that PTL treatment prevented engraftment of multiple LIC populations in NOD/LtSz-scid IL-2Rgamma(c)-null mice. PTL treatment of mice with established leukemias from low- and high-risk patients resulted in survival and restoration of normal murine hemopoiesis. In only 3 cases, disease progression was significantly slowed in mice engrafted with CD34(+)/CD19(-) or CD34(+)/CD7(-) and CD34(-) cells, but was not prevented, demonstrating that individual LIC populations within patients have different responses to therapy.

Mobilization of tissue-resident cells into the blood removes CLL cells from this nurturing milieu and sensitizes them to cytotoxic drugs. This concept recently gained momentum after the clinical activity of kinase inhibitors that target BCR signaling (spleen tyrosine kinase, Bruton tyrosine kinase, PI3Kdelta inhibitors) was established. Besides antiproliferative activity, these drugs cause CLL cell redistribution with rapid lymph node shrinkage, along with a transient surge in lymphocytosis, before inducing objective remissions. Inactivation of critical CLL homing mechanism (chemokine receptors, adhesion molecules), thwarting tissue retention and recirculation into the tissues, appears to be the basis for this striking clinical activity. This effect of BCR-signaling inhibitors resembles redistribution of CLL cells after glucocorticoids, described as early as in the 1940s. As such, we are witnessing a renaissance of the concept of leukemia cell redistribution in modern CLL therapy. Here, we review the molecular basis of CLL cell trafficking, homing, and redistribution and similarities between old and new drugs affecting these processes.

Here we show that it is PBX3, but not PBX1 or PBX2, that is consistently coexpressed with HOXA9 in various subtypes of CA-AML, particularly MLL-rearranged AML, and thus appears as a potential pathologic cofactor of HOXA9 in CA-AML. We then show that depletion of endogenous Pbx3 expression by shRNA significantly inhibits MLL-fusion-mediated cell transformation, and coexpressed PBX3 exhibits a significantly synergistic effect with HOXA9 in promoting cell transformation in vitro and leukemogenesis in vivo. Furthermore, as a proof of concept, we show that a small peptide, namely HXR9, which was developed to specifically disrupt the interactions between HOX and PBX proteins, can selectively kill leukemic cells with overexpression of HOXA/PBX3 genes.

The present study was designed to investigate the prognostic relevance of CD44 and CD27 molecules in patients with B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). CD27 and CD44 expression was determined in 58 patients by flow cytometry and their relation to established prognostic factors and response to therapy was investigated. Four patterns of expression were found; CD27 single positive (SP) in 20.7 % of patients, CD44SP in 25.8 %, CD27CD44 double positive (DP) in 20.7 %, and CD27CD44 double negative (DN) in 32.8 %.

We review studies investigating the presence of malignant cells in cryopreserved ovarian tissue from patients with malignant disease and based on the strength of the evidence, recommendations for transplantations are proposed. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic review of the literature. All peer reviewed studies evaluating the presence of malignant cells in cryopreserved human ovarian tissue were included. Data were searched in Pubmed and Embase with no language restrictions. RESULTS: The majority of the reviewed papers were casuistic reports and few of the included papers were specifically designed to search for malignant cells. Ovarian tissue from 422 patients has been subject to testing for malignant cells by imaging, histology, immunohistochemistry, molecular biology, animal- or clinical transplantation. In 31 (7 %) of the cases the applied test raised suspicion of malignant cell infiltration. No transplantation-related relapse of cancer has been reported after 33 transplantations of frozen/thawed ovarian cortex. CONCLUSION: The quality and strength of the evidence is generally low and prospective studies are needed. The risk of re-introducing a malignant condition when transplanting ovarian tissue depends on the particular disease. Based on the available data, the risk was estimated: Leukaemia: HIGH. Gastrointestinal cancers: MODERATE.

It has been suggested that the accumulation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) is involved in megakaryocytic differentiation induced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) in the K562 leukemia cell line. Therefore, a ROS-inducible technique could be a powerful method of differentiation induction. Accordingly, we hypothesized that ionizing radiation contributes to the acceleration of megakaryocytic differentiation through the accumulation of intracellular ROS in leukemia cells. In the present study, ionizing radiation was shown to promote PMA-induced megakaryocytic differentiation. Cells with high CD41 expression sustained intracellular ROS levels effectively. The enhancement of differentiation by ionizing radiation was found to be regulated through the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, involving both extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) and p38 MAPK. Ionizing radiation also controlled mRNA expression of the oxidative stress response gene heme oxygenase-1 (HO1).

TRAF6 (tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6), an E3 ubiquitin ligase, is critically involved in TLR-signaling. Based on the observation that TRAF6 might play a role in AKT phosphorylation, we hypothesized that TRAF6 can enhance the constitutive FLT3-ITD-driven activation of AKT after LPS stimulation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Human MV4-11 FLT3-ITD cells were silenced for TRAF6 by stable shRNA expression. Western blotting was used to analyze signal transduction by detection of phosphorylated proteins. LPS-induced activation of the NF-kappaB pathway was ensured by the induction of IkappaBalpha expression. To evaluate a potential functional role of TRAF6, we also performed chemosensitivity assays. RESULTS: In MV4-11 cells, AKT was activated in response to LPS treatment. Surprisingly, shRNA-mediated knockdown of TRAF6 resulted in a significant increase in basal AKT phosphorylation. By LPS stimulation, the gain of AKT phosphorylation was more pronounced in the TRAF6 knockdown cell line than in the control. In addition, the concentration-dependent induction of apoptosis in response to treatment with the cytostatic drugs cytarabine or daunorubicin was significantly reduced in TRAF6-depleted MV4-11 cells. CONCLUSION: Our data strongly suggest that the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRAF6 plays an important functional role in signal transduction and survival of AML cells. We hypothesize that LPS-mediated stimulation of TLR-4 leads to the induction of NF-kappaB-mediated signaling. However, TRAF6 might prevent a synergistic activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway after activation of TLR-4 signaling in FLT3-ITD-positive cells.",,"['Schnetzke, Ulf', 'Fischer, Mike', 'Kuhn, Anne-Kathrin', 'Spies-Weisshart, Barbel', 'Zirm, Elisabeth', 'Hochhaus, Andreas', 'Muller, Jorg P', 'Scholl, Sebastian']","['Schnetzke U', 'Fischer M', 'Kuhn AK', 'Spies-Weisshart B', 'Zirm E', 'Hochhaus A', 'Muller JP', 'Scholl S']","['Abteilung Hamatologie/Onkologie, Klinik fur Innere Medizin II, Universitatsklinikum Jena, Erlanger Allee 101, 07740 Jena, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121221,Germany,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol,Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology,7902060,"['0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (TLR4 protein, human)', '0 (TNF Receptor-Associated Factor 6)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 4)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",IM,,"['Apoptosis', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'Lipopolysaccharides/*pharmacology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'NF-kappa B/genetics/metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction', 'TNF Receptor-Associated Factor 6/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Toll-Like Receptor 4/genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics/*metabolism']",,,2012/12/25 06:00,2013/05/23 06:00,['2012/12/25 06:00'],"['2012/10/12 00:00 [received]', '2012/12/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/12/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/12/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00432-012-1362-4 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol. 2013 Apr;139(4):605-15. doi: 10.1007/s00432-012-1362-4.

The increase in apoptosis was also associated with proteolytic activation of caspases, Bid cleavage, insertion of pro-apoptotic Bax into the mitochondria and release of cytochrome c from mitochondria to cytosol. Furthermore, it was found that Bcl-2 overexpression markedly protected U937 cells from 7,8-DHF-induced apoptosis by restoring activation of caspases. In addition, 7,8-DHF treatment effectively activated the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK), and inhibitors of extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), but not p38 MAPK, which significantly reduced 7,8-DHF-induced apoptosis.

In this study, we further explored the relationship between the cell death pathway and cytoplasmic vacuolization and studied the underlying mechanism of leukemia cell death mediated by honokiol. The results showed that low concentrations of honokiol activated an novel alternative cell death fitted the criteria of paraptosis, such as cytoplasmic vacuolization derived from endoplasmic reticulum swelling, lack of caspase activation, and lack of apoptotic morphology. Results further indicated that the cell death was time- and concentration-dependent. In addition, honokiol-induced paraptosis did not involve membrane blebbing, chromatin condensation and phosphatidylserine exposure at the outer of the plasma membrane. The mechanism of the cell death may be associated, at least in part, with the increased generation of reactive oxygen species. Further analysis showed that honokiol induces cell death predominantly via paraptosis and to a certain extent via apoptosis in NB4 cells, and predominantly via apoptosis and to a certain extent via paraptosis in K562 cells.

The challenge lies in the complicated pathogenesis of cancers that often involve the dysfunction of many genes and regulatory interactions. Thus, sophisticated classification model is in pressing need. In this study, we proposed an efficient approach, called ellipsoidFN (ellipsoid Feature Net), to model the disease complexity by ellipsoids and seek a set of heterogeneous biomarkers. Our approach achieves a non-linear classification scheme for the mixed samples by the ellipsoid concept, and at the same time uses a linear programming framework to efficiently select biomarkers from high-dimensional space. ellipsoidFN reduces the redundancy and improves the complementariness between the identified biomarkers, thus significantly enhancing the distinctiveness between cancers and normal samples, and even between cancer types. Numerical evaluation on real prostate cancer, breast cancer and leukemia gene expression datasets suggested that ellipsoidFN outperforms the state-of-the-art biomarker identification methods, and it can serve as a useful tool for cancer biomarker identification in the future.

Here, we show that autophagy inhibitor chloroquine (CQ) increases HIF-1 alpha accumulation, thus potentiating CoCl(2)-induced growth arrest and differentiation of leukemic cells. Furthermore, the increased effect of CQ on differentiation induction is dependent of the inhibition of autophagosome maturation and degradation, since this sensitization could be mimicked by the suppression of expression of both lysosome-associated membrane proteins 1 and 2 (LAMP1 and LAMP2). These findings not only provide the evidence that CQ is a sensitizer for CoCl(2)-induced differentiation of leukemic cells but also possibly propose the new therapeutic strategy for differentiation induction of AML.",['Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

In this study, we investigated whether anisomycin treatment could modulate TRAIL-mediated apoptosis in human renal carcinoma Caki cells. We found that anisomycin treatment (10-15 nM) alone had no effect on the level of apoptosis, but a combination treatment of anisomycin and TRAIL significantly increased the level of apoptosis in human renal carcinoma (Caki, ACHN and A498), human glioma (U251MG), and human breast carcinoma (MDA-MB-361 and MCF7) cells. Anisomycin treatment led to the down-regulation of Bcl-2 expression at the transcriptional level, and the over-expression of Bcl-2 inhibited the apoptosis induced by the combination treatment of anisomycin and TRAIL. Furthermore, anisomycin treatment resulted in the down-regulation of c-FLIP(L) and Mcl-1 at the post-transcriptional level, and the over-expression of c-FLIP(L) and Mcl-1 blocked the induction of apoptosis caused by the combination treatment of anisomycin with TRAIL. In contrast, anisomycin treatment had no effect on the levels of TRAIL-mediated apoptosis in mouse kidney cells (TMCK-1) or normal human skin fibroblasts (HSF).

In this work, we present a detailed vibrational spectroscopic investigation of beta-form by using FT-IR and FT-Raman spectra. These data are supported by quantum mechanical calculations using DFT employing 6-311G(d,p) basis set, which allow us to characterize completely the vibrational spectra of this compound.

The importance of hydrogen-bond formation in the molecular packing arrangements of both forms has been examined with the vibrational shifts observed due to polymorphic changes. The red shift of the NH stretching bands in the infrared spectrum from the computed wavenumber indicates the weakening of the NH bond.

However, the difference in inducing oxidative stress, apoptosis and immunotoxicity by the two enantiomers in zebrafish still remains unclear. In the present study, the zebrafish were exposed to environmental concentrations of cis-BF, 1R-cis-BF and 1S-cis-BF during the embryos developmental stage.

Patients with an extreme leucocytosis secondary to leukaemia can suffer an incorrect diagnosis of hypoxemia, called ""pseudohypoxaemia"". This is basically due to the rapid in vitro oxygen consumption, and is characterized by a low partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood (PaO2) despite a normal oxygen saturation (SpO2) measured by pulse oximetry. Pseudohypoxaemia appears in patients with thrombocytosis or hyper-leucocytosis occurring during blastic crisis of a leukaemia. It must be suspected in patients with a discrepancy between the SpO2 measured by oximetry and the PaO2. In this context, pulse oximetry is the most accurate way to establish the diagnosis and to avoid unnecessary actions. We report the case of a patient with chronic myeloid leukaemia and extreme leucocytosis requiring emergency surgery, and diagnosed with pseudohypoxaemia during the perioperative period that led to a delay in the extubation of the patient.","['Copyright (c) 2012 Sociedad Espanola de Anestesiologia, Reanimacion y Terapeutica', 'del Dolor.

However, prognostic stratification and treatment decision for the intermediate risk category, that mostly comprises AML patients with normal cytogenetics (CN-AML), has been difficult due to the clinical heterogeneity and scarce knowledge of the molecular alterations underlying this large AML subgroup. During the past decade, the identification of several mutations associated with CN-AML has resulted into important advances in the AML field. In this review, we address the biological features of the main mutations associated with CN-AML and the impact of next generation sequencing studies in expanding our knowledge of the molecular landscape of CN-AML.

However, DLI application is limited by the development of graft-versus-host disease and aplasia, and thus cannot be routinely applied for prophylaxis. Therefore, important questions remain to be answered, such as when, and whom to DLI? Recent advances enable DLI using allografts of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor-mobilized peripheral blood progenitor cells; allodepleted donor T cells; and infusions of donor-derived, ex vivo-expanded, CD8(+) cytotoxic T lymphocyte, which can decrease relapse and improve transplant outcomes. Preemptive immunotherapy of relapse was also introduced based on the determination of mixed chimerism and minimal residual disease.

Second, GA-induced proteasome inhibition is a prerequisite for its cytotoxicity and anticancer effect without off-targets.

We determined the structure of the AF9 AHD in complex with the elongation factor AF4 and show that aliphatic residues, which are conserved in each of the AF9 binding partners, form an integral part of the hydrophobic core of the complex.

Identifying potential prognostic factors for survival may guide decitabine treatment decisions and improve outcomes. BACKGROUND: Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) progress to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in approximately 30% of patients. Identification of risk factors for progression to AML and overall survival (OS) would help guide treatment decisions. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We investigated prognostic factors for progression to AML and survival in 163 patients with MDS treated with decitabine 15 mg/m(2) over 3 hours every 8 hours for 3 days every 6 weeks (n = 74) or 20 mg/m(2) over 1 hour daily for 5 days every 4 weeks (n = 89). RESULTS: Multivariate analysis of pooled baseline data revealed that only study effect was associated with progression to AML. A hemoglobin value at least 10 g/dL, platelet count at least 50 x 10(3)/muL, and lack of chromosome 5 or 7 abnormalities were associated with longer OS.

In contrast to the significant progress in uncovering genetic lesions and prognostic factors for B-cell lineage lymphoid malignancies, prognostic markers that can predict clinical outcome of T-lymphoblastic lymphoma/leukemia remain to be discovered and validated. Recently, specific micro-RNAs have emerged as potential biomarkers for the diagnosis and prognosis of various types of tumor. Among them, miR-16 is known to play important roles in the development of hematological malignancies. Using quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, we analyzed miR-16 expression level in archived formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded diagnostic lymph node specimens from a total of 72 patients with T-lymphoblastic lymphoma/leukemia and for which clinical follow-up information was available. Although no statistically significant difference was evident in patients with T-lymphoblastic lymphoma/leukemia versus controls with reactive lymph nodes (P = .163), T-lymphoblastic lymphoma/leukemia patients with a greater than median expression level of miR-16 had a longer overall survival than patients with a less than median expression level. The overall 1-year survival rate was 50% for the high expression group but was 26.5% for the low expression group (P = .043). To our knowledge, we provide here the first evidence that the expression of a single micro-RNA, miR-16, is associated with clinical outcome of patients with T-lymphoblastic lymphoma/leukemia. Therefore, miR-16 may be considered as a potential prognostic marker for T-lymphoblastic lymphoma/leukemia.",['Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

The stromal layer is critical to the progression and survival of the neoplasm and consequently is recruited into the tumor microenvironment. METHODS: Using both syngeneic mouse tumors (ID8-R) and human xenograft (OVCAR3, SKOV3) tumor models, we first confirmed that intraperitoneally injected circulating mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) could target, preferentially engraft and differentiate into alpha-smooth muscle actin-positive myofibroblasts, suggesting their role as ""reactive stroma"" in ovarian carcinoma development and confirming their potential as a targeted delivery vehicle for the intratumoral production of interferon-beta (IFN-beta). Mice with ovarian carcinomas then received weekly intraperitoneal injections of IFN-beta expressing MSCs. RESULTS: Intraperitoneal injections of IFN-beta expressing MSCs resulted in complete eradication of tumors in 70% of treated OVCAR3 mice (P = 0.004) and an increased survival of treated SKOV3 mice compared with controls (P = 0.01). Similar tumor growth control was observed using murine IFN-beta delivered by murine MSCs in ID8-R ovarian carcinoma. As a potential mechanism of tumor killing, MSCs produced IFN-beta-induced caspase-dependent tumor cell apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that ovarian carcinoma engrafts MSCs to participate in myofibrovascular networks and that IFN-beta produced by MSCs intratumorally modulates tumor kinetics, resulting in prolonged survival.",['Published by Elsevier Inc.'],"['Dembinski, Jennifer L', 'Wilson, Shanna M', 'Spaeth, Erika L', 'Studeny, Matus', 'Zompetta, Claudia', 'Samudio, Ismael', 'Roby, Katherine', 'Andreeff, Michael', 'Marini, Frank C']","['Dembinski JL', 'Wilson SM', 'Spaeth EL', 'Studeny M', 'Zompetta C', 'Samudio I', 'Roby K', 'Andreeff M', 'Marini FC']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.

Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL, Apo2L) is a cytokine of the TNF family with selective anti-tumor activity and minimal toxicity toward healthy tissues. Primary leukemia cells are, however, largely intrinsically resistant to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. In this study we analyzed molecular differences between TRAIL-resistant K562 cell line and TRAIL-sensitive K562 clones. We demonstrate that TRAIL-sensitive K562 cells differ from the TRAIL-resistant cell line by cell surface downregulation of TRAIL decoy receptor 1, upregulation of both TRAIL death receptors, enhanced assembly and improved functioning of the death-inducing signaling complex, and increased cytoplasmic protein expression of CASP8 and key proapoptotic BCL2 members BID, BIM, BAD and BAK. The molecular basis of the intrinsic leukemia cell TRAIL resistance thus appears a consequence of the multi-level disruption of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway. The results of this study also suggest that the leukemia TRAIL-resistance is functional, leaving a possibility of overcoming the resistance by preexposure of the leukemia cells to potent TRAIL sensitizers, e.g. BH3-mimetics.",,"['Leahomschi, S', 'Molinsky, J', 'Klanova, M', 'Andera, L', 'Peterka, M', 'Gasova, Z', 'Klener, P Sr', 'Trneny, M', 'Necas, E', 'Simonova, T', 'Zivny, J', 'Klener, P Jr']","['Leahomschi S', 'Molinsky J', 'Klanova M', 'Andera L', 'Peterka M', 'Gasova Z', 'Klener P Sr', 'Trneny M', 'Necas E', 'Simonova T', 'Zivny J', 'Klener P Jr']","['Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Slovakia,Neoplasma,Neoplasma,0377266,"['0 (Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",IM,,"['*Apoptosis', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/analysis', 'Signal Transduction', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology']",,,2012/12/25 06:00,2013/06/13 06:00,['2012/12/25 06:00'],"['2012/12/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/12/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.4149/neo_2013_030 [doi]'],ppublish,Neoplasma. 2013;60(2):223-31. doi: 10.4149/neo_2013_030.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

AIMS: retrospective analysis to evaluate the role of ASCT in patients with AML without HLA-matched donor. METHODS: between December 19, 1994 and August 1, 2012, a total of 63 patients with AML without HLA-matched donor in the department of Hematology and Transfusion Medicine, University Hospital, Bratislava, received an ASCT. Median age was 41 years (20-61 years). There were 35 (56%) males and 28 (44%) females. At the time of ASCT, 50 (79%) patients were in first complete remission (CR), 11 (18%) patients were in second CR and 2 (3%) patients were in relapse. RESULTS: with a median follow-up of 115 months (34-214 months), the 10 year overall survival (OS) and disease free survival (DFS) of all patients was 55% and 51%, respectively. Transplant-related mortality was 6%. The relapse rate was 38% and 9 years probability of relapse was 44%.

Similar mechanisms are active in tumor-reactive stroma where CTGF is expressed. Other potential roles include prevention of hypoxia-induced apoptosis and promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transistion (EMT). CTGF expression in tumors has been associated to both tumor suppression and progression. For example, CTGF expression in acute lymphoblastic leukemia, breast, pancreas and gastric cancer correlates to worse prognosis whereas the opposite is true for colorectal, lung and ovarian cancer. This discrepancy is not yet understood. High expression of CTGF is a hallmark of ileal carcinoids, which are well-differentiated endocrine carcinomas with serotonin production originating from the small intestine and proximal colon. These tumors maintain a high grade of differentiation and low proliferation. Despite this, they are malignant and most patients have metastatic disease at diagnosis. These tumors demonstrate several phenotypes potentially related to CTGF function namely: cell migration, absent tumor cell apoptosis, as well as, reactive and well vascularised myofibroblast rich stroma and fibrosis development locally and in distal organs. The presence of CTGF in other endocrine tumors indicates a role in the progression of well-differentiated tumors.",,"['Jacobson, Annica', 'Cunningham, Janet L']","['Jacobson A', 'Cunningham JL']","['Section of Osteoporosis and Clinical Pharmacogenetics, Department of Medical Sciences, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Department of Neuroscience, Psychiatry, Uppsala University, Sweden.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20120606,England,Fibrogenesis Tissue Repair,Fibrogenesis & tissue repair,101464642,,,,,PMC3368788,,2012/12/25 06:00,2012/12/25 06:01,['2012/12/25 06:00'],"['2012/12/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/12/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/25 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/1755-1536-5-S1-S8 [doi]', '1755-1536-5-S1-S8 [pii]']",epublish,Fibrogenesis Tissue Repair. 2012 Jun 6;5(Suppl 1):S8. doi: 10.1186/1755-1536-5-S1-S8. eCollection 2012.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Even since asbestos is banned in most developed countries, the peak wave of MPM incidence is anticipated for the next years due to the long latency of asbestos induced MPM. MPM patients not eligible for surgical procedures like decortication or pleuro-pneumectomie have a median survival of 12 months with palliative chemotherapy. Therefore, new therapeutic approaches are of crucial need in this clinical situation. METHODS/DESIGN: This is a phase I trial for patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma with pleural effusion testing the safety of a fixed single dose of 1x106 adoptively transferred FAP-specific re-directed T cells given directly in the pleural effusion. Lymphocytes will be taken 21 days before transfer from peripheral blood. CD8 positive T cells will be isolated and re-programmed by retroviral transfer of a chimeric antigen receptor recognizing FAP which serves as target structure in MPM. At day 0 of the protocol, re-directed T cells will be injected in the pleural effusion and patients will be monitored for 48h under intermediate care conditions. AE, SAE, SADR and SUSAR will be monitored for 35 days and evaluated by an independent safety board to define any dose limiting toxicity (DLT). No further patient can be treated before the previous patient passed day 14 after T cell transfer. The protocol will be judged as save when no DLT occurred in the first 3 patients, or 1 DLT in 6 patients. Secondary objectives are feasibility and immune monitoring. DISCUSSION: Adoptive T cell transfer is a new and rapidly expanding branch of immunotherapies focusing on cancer treatment. Recently, objective responses could be observed in patients with chronic lymphatic leukemia treated with adoptively transferred CD19-specific re-directed T cells. The choice of the target antigen determines the possible on-target off-tissue toxicity of such approaches. There are reports of severe toxicity in patients who received T cells intravenously due to unexpected expression of the target antigen (on-target) in other tissues than the tumor (off-tissue). To minimize the risk of on-target off-tissue toxicity and to maximize the on-target anti-tumor effect we propose a clinical protocol with loco-regional administration of re-directed T cells. FAP-specific T cells will be directly injected in the pleural effusion of patients with MPM.

This report addresses the case of an adolescent patient with acute lymphoblastic leukemia who underwent three allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantations and developed pulmonary aspergillosis. Combination therapy with liposomal amphotericin B (L-AmB, 3 mg/kg bw/day) and caspofungin (CAS, 50 mg/day) during the first allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) improved the pulmonary situation.

The BCR-ABL kinase inhibitor, imatinib, is the front-line treatment for CML, but the emergence of imatinib resistance and other tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) has called attention for additional resistance mechanisms and has led to the search for alternative drug treatments.

Here, we investigated the regulation and role of eIF2alpha in acute promyelocytic (APL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells in response to all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and arsenic trioxide (ATO), the front-line therapies in APL. ATRA and ATO induce Ser-51 phosphorylation (inactivation) of eIF2alpha, through the induction of protein kinase C delta (PKCdelta) and PKR, but not other eIF2alpha kinases, such as GCN2 and PERK in APL (NB4) and AML cells (HL60, U937, and THP-1). Inhibition of eIF2alpha reduced the expression of cellular proteins that are involved in apoptosis (DAP5/p97), cell cycle (p21Waf1/Cip1), differentiation (TG2) and induced those regulating proliferation (c-myc) and survival (p70S6K). PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway is involved in regulation of eIF2alpha through PKCdelta/PKR axis.

However, how these agents modulate 1,25D effects in different subtypes of AML cells remains poorly understood. Here, we show that both carnosic acid (CA) and silibinin (SIL) synergistically enhancd 1,25D-induced differentiation of myeloblastic HL60 cells. However, in promonocytic U937 cells, only CA caused potentiation while SIL attenuated 1,25D effect. The enhanced effect of 1,25D+CA was accompanied by increases in both the vitamin D receptor (VDR) and retinoid X receptor alpha (RXRalpha) protein levels and vitamin D response element (VDRE) transactivation in both cell lines. Similar increases were observed in HL60 cells treated with 1,25D + SIL. In U937 cells, however, SIL inhibited 1,25D-induced VDRE transactivation concomitant with downregulation of RXRalpha at both transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels. These inhibitory effects correlated with the inability of SIL, with or without 1,25D, to activate the Nrf2/antioxidant response element signaling pathway in U937 cells. These results suggest that opposite effects of SIL on 1,25D-induced differentiation of HL60 and U937 cells may be determined by cell-type-specific signaling and transcriptional responses to this polyphenol resulting in differential modulation of RXRalpha expression.",,"['Wassermann, Rina', 'Novik, Victoria', 'Danilenko, Michael']","['Wassermann R', 'Novik V', 'Danilenko M']","['Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Faculty of Health Sciences, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, P.O.

The precise mechanism of oncogenesis is not known, but there is evidence that two regulatory viral proteins, Tax and HBZ, are involved. A high set point proviral load is associated with development of ATLL or a chronic inflammatory condition, HAM/TSP. Several lines of evidence, including HLA class 1 association studies and in vitro killing assays, indicate that cytotoxic T lymphocytes are instrumental in determining this proviral load set point. Prior studies have focused chiefly on the CTL response to the immunodominant Tax protein: efficient lysis of Tax-expressing cells inversely correlates with proviral load in nonmalignant infection. However, a recent study showed that strong binding of peptides from HBZ, but not Tax, to HLA class 1 molecules was associated with a low proviral load and a reduced risk of developing HAM/TSP, indicating an important role for HBZ-specific CTL in determining infection outcome. In comparison with nonmalignant infection, HTLV-1-specific CTLs in ATLL patients are reduced in frequency and functionally deficient.

The diversity in clinical features and prognosis of patients with this disease has led to its subtype-classification into four categories, acute, lymphoma, chronic, and smoldering types, defined by organ involvement, and LDH and calcium values. In case of acute, lymphoma, or unfavorable chronic subtypes (aggressive ATL), intensive chemotherapy like the LSG15 regimen (VCAP-AMP-VECP) is usually recommended if outside of clinical trials, based on the results of a phase 3 trial. In case of favorable chronic or smoldering ATL (indolent ATL), watchful waiting until disease progression has been recommended, although the long-term prognosis was inferior to those of, for instance, chronic lymphoid leukemia. Retrospective analysis suggested that the combination of interferon alpha and zidovudine was apparently promising for the treatment of ATL, especially for types with leukemic manifestation. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is also promising for the treatment of aggressive ATL possibly reflecting graft versus ATL effect.

The desired level of immune response can be achieved only by codelivering immune-modulating agents along with the antigenic epitopes present in these high-purity formulations. This study aimed to explore the adjuvant effect of nucleotide oligomerization domain (NOD) receptor agonists as immunomodulators encapsulated in polymeric microparticles as carriers. METHODS: Microparticles (MP) prepared from poly[(rac-lactide)-co-glycolide] (PLGA) (Mn = 5 kDa, PD = 3.2) by the water-in-oil-in-water (w/o/w) emulsion/solvent evaporation technique were characterized in terms of size, surface morphology, payload and endotoxin content. As NOD agonists, N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanyl-D-isoglutamine (MDP; NOD 2) and gamma-D-glutamyl-meso-diaminopimelic acid (iE-DAP; NOD 1) were encapsulated. The immunomodulatory potential of these ligand-loaded MP was evaluated with a human acute monocytic leukemia cell line (THP-1X Blue-CD14 cells). RESULTS: The MP prepared had a phagocytosable size (<10 microm) with a unimodal size distribution and low endotoxin content (<0.5 EU/mL). A dose-dependent cell activation could be established for MDP-loaded microparticles. CONCLUSIONS: MP with suitable characteristics for phagocytosis can be prepared and loaded with NOD agonists. The capability of these ligand-loaded microparticles to activate monocytes suggests their broader exploration as vaccine carriers.",,"['Mathew, Simi', 'Roch, Toralf', 'Frentsch, Marco', 'Lendlein, Andreas', 'Wischke, Christian']","['Mathew S', 'Roch T', 'Frentsch M', 'Lendlein A', 'Wischke C']","['Center for Biomaterial Development, Institute of Polymer Research, Helmholtz-Zentrum Geesthacht, Teltow, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Appl Biomater Funct Mater,Journal of applied biomaterials & functional materials,101586617,"['0 (Adjuvants, Immunologic)', '0 (Emulsions)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Nod Signaling Adaptor Proteins)', '0 (Oils)', '0 (Vaccines, Subunit)', '059QF0KO0R (Water)', '1SIA8062RS (Polylactic Acid-Polyglycolic Acid Copolymer)', '26009-03-0 (Polyglycolic Acid)', '33X04XA5AT (Lactic Acid)', '53678-77-6 (Acetylmuramyl-Alanyl-Isoglutamine)', '583-93-7 (Diaminopimelic Acid)', ""71974-09-9 (N(2)-(gamma-D-glutamyl)-meso-2,2'-diaminopimelic acid)""]",IM,,"['Acetylmuramyl-Alanyl-Isoglutamine/chemistry/metabolism', 'Adjuvants, Immunologic', 'Cell Line', 'Diaminopimelic Acid/analogs & derivatives/chemistry/metabolism', 'Drug Compounding', 'Emulsions/chemistry', 'Humans', 'Lactic Acid/chemistry', 'Ligands', '*Microspheres', 'Nod Signaling Adaptor Proteins/*agonists/metabolism', 'Oils/chemistry', 'Phagocytes/cytology/*immunology', 'Phagocytosis/immunology', 'Polyglycolic Acid/chemistry', 'Polylactic Acid-Polyglycolic Acid Copolymer', 'Vaccines, Subunit/immunology', 'Water/chemistry']",,,2012/12/22 06:00,2013/09/26 06:00,['2012/12/22 06:00'],"['2012/10/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/12/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/12/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/26 06:00 [medline]']","['BB5534C0-453B-4C12-9EFE-35A69526F0D5 [pii]', '10.5301/JABFM.2012.10438 [doi]']",ppublish,J Appl Biomater Funct Mater. 2012;10(3):229-36. doi: 10.5301/JABFM.2012.10438.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is essential to have sensitive and reproducible methods of either quantifying or isolating these stem cells and progenitors to understand their intrinsic properties and how extrinsic signals regulate their development. However, stem cells are difficult to distinguish from multipotential progenitors, which may look and act like them. Here we define a 4-color flow cytometry panel using CD133, LeX, CD140a, NG2 to define a neural stem cell (NSC) as well as 4 classes of multipotential progenitors and 3 classes of bipotential progenitors, several of which have not been described previously. We performed gain and loss of function studies for leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and showed a depletion of NSCs, a subset of multipotential neural precursors and immature oligodendrocytes in LIF null mice. Gain of function studies showed that LIF increased the abundance of these precursors. Our studies also show that these NPs have differential requirements for LIF and ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) and for epidermal growth factor (EGF), fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) for their propagation in vitro. Surprisingly, the related cytokine, CNTF, was less potent than LIF in increasing the NSCs and more potent than LIF in increasing the PDGF responsive multipotential precursors. Finally, we show that LIF increases the expression of the core transcription factors: Klf4, Fbx15, Nanog, Sox2 and c-Myc. Altogether our FACS (fluorescence-activated cell sorter) analyses reveal that the neonatal subventricular zone is far more heterogeneous than previously suspected and our studies provide new insights into the signals and mechanisms that regulate their self-renewal and proliferation.","['Copyright (c) 2012 S.

Increased risks of some cancers in people with NF are well recognised, but there is no comprehensive enumeration of the risks across the whole range of site-specific cancers.

METHODS: A linked data set of hospital admissions and deaths in England was used to compare rates of tumours in an NF cohort with rates in a comparison cohort, with results expressed as rate ratios (RR). RESULTS: The RR for all cancers combined, in people with both types of NF combined, was 4.3 (95% confidence interval (CI): 4.0-4.6), based on 769 cases of cancer in 8003 people with NF. Considering only people with presumed NF1 (as defined in the main article), the RR for all cancers excluding nervous system malignancies remained elevated (2.7, 95% CI: 2.4-2.9); and risks were significantly high for cancer of the oesophagus (3.3), stomach (2.8), colon (2.0), liver (3.8), lung (3.0), bone (19.6), thyroid (4.9), malignant melanoma (3.6), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (3.3), chronic myeloid leukaemia (6.7), female breast (2.3) and ovary (3.7).

METHODS: Wistar rats were infused intermittently or continually with 50% glucose solution for 48 h. Serum and myocardium were taken to measure the levels of malondialdehyde and glutathione peroxidase. The expression of nuclear factor (NF)-kB and apoptosis in myocardial cells was determined with immunohistochemisty and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling, respectively. Expressions of B-cell lymphoma/leukemia-2-associated X protein and B-cell lymphoma/leukemia 2 in myocardium were tested with Western blot analysis. RESULTS: The levels of malondialdehyde and B-cell lymphoma/leukemia-2-associated X protein in the acute blood glucose fluctuation group (AFG) were enhanced, but glutathione peroxidase and B-cell lymphoma/leukemia-2 were reduced compared with levels in the continually high blood glucose group (p < 0.05). The expression of NF-kB in the nuclei of myocardial cells in the AFG was significantly higher than that in the continually high blood glucose group (p < 0.05).

However, its role in the molecular pathogenesis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is unclear. We analyzed gene expression profiling data from 350 DLBCL patient samples and detected that activated B-cell-like (ABC) DLBCLs express MCL1 at significantly higher levels compared with germinal center B-cell-like DLBCL patient samples (P=2.7 x 10(-10)). Immunohistochemistry confirmed high MCL1 protein expression predominantly in ABC DLBCL in an independent patient cohort (n=249; P=0.001). To elucidate molecular mechanisms leading to aberrant MCL1 expression, we analyzed array comparative genomic hybridization data of 203 DLBCL samples and identified recurrent chromosomal gains/amplifications of the MCL1 locus that occurred in 26% of ABC DLBCLs. In addition, aberrant STAT3 signaling contributed to high MCL1 expression in this subtype. Knockdown of MCL1 as well as treatment with the BH3-mimetic obatoclax induced apoptotic cell death in MCL1-positive DLBCL cell lines. In summary, MCL1 is deregulated in a significant fraction of ABC DLBCLs and contributes to therapy resistance. These data suggest that specific inhibition of MCL1 might be utilized therapeutically in a subset of DLBCLs.",,"['Wenzel, S-S', 'Grau, M', 'Mavis, C', 'Hailfinger, S', 'Wolf, A', 'Madle, H', 'Deeb, G', 'Dorken, B', 'Thome, M', 'Lenz, P', 'Dirnhofer, S', 'Hernandez-Ilizaliturri, F J', 'Tzankov, A', 'Lenz, G']","['Wenzel SS', 'Grau M', 'Mavis C', 'Hailfinger S', 'Wolf A', 'Madle H', 'Deeb G', 'Dorken B', 'Thome M', 'Lenz P', 'Dirnhofer S', 'Hernandez-Ilizaliturri FJ', 'Tzankov A', 'Lenz G']","['Department of Hematology, Oncology and Tumor Immunology, Molecular Cancer Research Center, Charite-Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121221,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)']",IM,,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Comparative Genomic Hybridization', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction']",,,2012/12/22 06:00,2013/08/10 06:00,['2012/12/22 06:00'],"['2012/12/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/12/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/10 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2012367 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2012.367 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2013 Jun;27(6):1381-90. doi: 10.1038/leu.2012.367.

We evaluated clinical outcomes of 295 lenalidomide-treated patients from two clinical trials (MDS-003 and MDS-004) and 125 untreated red blood cell (RBC) transfusion-dependent patients with del(5q) Low- or Intermediate-1 (Int-1)-risk MDS from a large multicenter registry. Risk factors for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) progression and mortality were assessed using Cox proportional hazards models with left truncation to adjust for study entry differences between cohorts. Baseline characteristics were well balanced across cohorts, except for a higher RBC transfusion burden in lenalidomide-treated patients (median, 6 vs 2 units/8 weeks). Median follow-up was 4.3 years from first dose for lenalidomide-treated patients and 4.6 years from diagnosis for untreated patients. Two-year cumulative AML progression incidences were 6.9% (95% confidence interval (CI): 3.3-13.9) and 12.1% (95% CI: 7.0-20.3) and 2-year overall survival (OS) probabilities were 89.9% (95% CI: 84.1-96.0) and 74.4% (95% CI: 66.1-83.7), respectively. AML progression risk was similar in both cohorts (hazard ratio (HR) 0.969, P=0.930); however, lenalidomide treatment was associated with significant improvement in survival (HR 0.597, P=0.012), after adjusting for all other covariates.

In particular, Polycomb-group (PcG) proteins have been shown to be involved in this process by repressing genes involved in cell-cycle regulation and differentiation. PcGs are histone modifiers that reside in two multi-protein complexes: Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 and 2 (PRC1 and PRC2). The existence of multiple orthologs for each Polycomb gene allows the formation of a multitude of distinct PRC1 and PRC2 sub-complexes. Changes in the expression of individual PcG genes are likely to cause perturbations in the composition of the PRC, which affect PRC enzymatic activity and target selectivity. An interesting recent development is that aberrant expression of, and mutations in, PcG genes have been shown to occur in hematopoietic neoplasms, where they display both tumor-suppressor and oncogenic activities. We therefore comprehensively reviewed the latest research on the role of PcG genes in normal and malignant blood cell development.

Recent studies have shown that chalcones and their derivatives induce apoptosis in different cell lines. Since new compounds with biological activity are needed, the aim of this study was to evaluate the cytotoxic effect of three synthetic chalcones, derived from 1-naphthaldehyde and 2-naphthaldehyde, on human acute myeloid leukemia K562 cells and on human acute lymphoblastic leukemia Jurkat cells. Based on the results, the most cytotoxic compound (A1) was chosen for further analysis in six human acute leukemia cells and in a human colon adenocarcinoma cell line (HT-29). Chalcone A1 significantly reduced the cell viability of K562, Jurkat, Kasumi, U937, CEM and NB4 cells in a concentration and time-dependent manner when compared with the control group (IC50 values between approximately 1.5 muM and 40 muM). It was also cytotoxic to HL-29 cells. To further examine its effect on normal cells, peripheral blood lymphocytes collected from healthy volunteers were incubated with the compound. It has also been incubated with human fibroblasts cultured from bone marrow (JMA). Chalcone A1 is non-cytotoxic to PBL cells and to JMA cells. A1 caused significant cell cycle arrest in all phases according to the cell line, and increased the proportion of cells in the sub G0/G1 phase. To evaluate whether this chalcone induced cell death via an apoptotic or necrotic pathway, cell morphology was examined using fluorescence microscopy. Cells treated with A1 at IC50 demonstrated the morphological characteristic of apoptosis, such as chromatin condensation and formation of apoptotic bodies.

The objective of the current study was to investigate the prevalence and spectrum of autosomal monosomies in an unselected cohort of patients with known or suspected MDS by using retrospective analysis. The results showed that bone marrow cytogenetic studies (1532 cases) were performed between 2004 and 2012, and an abnormal karyotype was found in 538 cases (35.1%). In the 538 cases, 202 (37.5%) cases had autosomal monosomies including sole (n = 47, 23.3%), part of two (n = 33, 21.3%) or more (n = 122, 78.7%) anomalies. Almost all 22 autosomes were involved, but monosomy 7 was by far the most frequent, constituting 66.1% of all isolated monosomies and the highest fraction of those with two or more abnormalities. Other recurrent sole monosomies included chromosomes 20 (15.0%) and 13 (8.5%). Monosomy 13 (12.5%), 18 (8.3%), 20 (6.3%), 17 (7.3%), 21 (5.2%), 5 (5.2%) and 12 (5.2%) were also recurrent in the setting of 3 abnormalities. Bone marrow histology and clinical information were reviewed in all cases with isolated monosomy; associated clinical phenotypes were found in RCMD (n = 20, 13 were -7), RAEB (n = 12, 11 were -7), RA (n = 9, 3 were -7) and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML, n = 6, 4 were -7) cases. Sole monosomy 20 (n = 7, RA 3 case and RCMD 4 cases) was not detected in RAEB or CMML cases. It is concluded that the presence of at least 1 autosomal monosomy was documented in approximately 37.5% of all abnormal cases, which has potential impact on a more than trivial fraction of patients with MDS. The preponderance of monosomy 7 implicates a pathogenetic role for haploinsufficiency of genes associated with chromosome 7. The rarity of sole monosomy involving other chromosomes other than 7, 20, and 13 suggests that haploinsufficiency involving entire chromosomes is detrimental to cell survival, unless their effect is overcome by the presence of other genetic changes that are often associated with additional chromosomal abnormalities.

The question of whether the excessive apoptosis and/or proliferation predominantly involve the subset of progenitor cells (CD34(+) cells) or mature cells (CD34(-) cells) remains a controversial issue. This study was purpose to analyze the apoptosis and proliferation status of CD34(+) and CD34(-) cells in bone marrow (BM) of patients with MDS, to investigate the pathogenesis of MDS and to determine the relation of apoptosis and proliferation status of CD34(+) and CD34(-) cells with prognosis of MDS. The proportion of CD34(+) cells, the apoptosis and proliferation ratio (A/P) of CD34(+) and CD34(-) cells in BM of 40 patients with MDS, including 20 cases of high-risk MDS and 20 cases of low-risk MDS, and 10 normal persons as control were detected by flow cytometry; the influence of CD34(+) and CD34(-) cell apoptosis and proliferation levels on prognosis of MDS was evaluated by univariate and multivariate analysis of survival. The results showed that the proportion of CD34(+) cells in BM of high-risk MDS patients was significantly higher than that in BM of low-risk MDS patients and in normal BM [(1.92 +/- 0.10)%, (1.09 +/- 0.04)%, (1.03 +/- 0.05)% respectively]. The apoptotic rates (AR) of both CD34(+) and CD34(-) cells were significantly higher in low-risk MDS [(54.75 +/- 2.18)%, (80.36 +/- 1.68)%] than in high-risk MDS [(24.87 +/- 2.69)%, (23.12 +/- 1.23)%] and in normal BM [(18.51 +/- 2.74)%, (20.98 +/- 2.21)%]. When compared between CD34(+) cells and CD34(-) cells in low-risk MDS, a greater AR of CD34(-) cells was found. However, the higher proliferative rate of CD34(+) cells was observed in high-risk MDS. In low-risk MDS, a higher A/P ratio was found in CD34(-) cells than in CD34(+) cells; whereas this ratio was equalized or inverted in high-risk MDS. In addition, the survival and prognosis correlated significantly with AR of CD34(+) cells. It is concluded that the early MDS is predominantly associated with excessive apoptosis of the mature CD34(-) cells. The proliferation rate of cells increases with the disease progression in MDS subsets, especially, in the subset of CD34(+) cells.

K562 cells were treated with different concentrations of As(2)O(3) or Bor (alone or combination) for 24, 48 h. MTT method was used to detect the cell proliferation. After K562 cells were treated with 0.5 micromol/L As(2)O(3) alone or in combination with 10 nmoL/L Bor, the apoptosis rate and cell cycle were measured by flow cytometry, and the activity of NF-kappaB was analyzed by SP immunohistochemistry. The results indicated that the different concentrations of As(2)O(3) and Bor could inhibit the K562 cell proliferation in a time- and dose-dependent manners (P < 0.05). The IC(50) of Bor and As(2)O(3) in 48 h were 20 nmol/L and 0.6 micromol/L respectively. When K562 cells were treated with As(2)O(3) or Bor alone for 24 h, the apoptotic rate of K562 cells increased, and the apoptotic rate in combination group was higher than that in As(2)O(3) or Bor group. The cells were apparently arrested in G(2)/M phase in Bor group and G(0)/G(1) phase in As(2)O(3) group. The activity of NF-kappaB decreased significantly in As(2)O(3) or Bor group (P < 0.05), this effect was most significant in the combination group (P < 0.01). It is concluded that both As(2)O(3) and Bor can inhibit the proliferation and induce apoptosis of K562 cells, a synergistic effect can be observed when a low dose of As(2)O(3) combined with low dose of Bor.

Two hundred and six children with B-ALL were enrolled in this study from Augest 2008 to September 2011 in our hospital. MRD levels were detected by flow cytometry at day 15, 33 and week 12 after initial chemotherapy. The event-free survival (EFS) for patients based on MRD levels measured at different stages of chemotherapy were compared by Kaplan Meier analyses. The results showed that out of 206 cases 196 cases achieved complete remission (CR) after induction therapy (CR rate 95.1%), the 1- and 3-year EFS rate were (92.7 +/- 1.8)% and (78.7 +/- 3.7)%, respectively, and the 3-year EFS rate was (85.6 +/- 4.9)% in standard risk group, (82.1 +/- 5.8)% in intermediate risk group and (58.1 +/- 9.2)% in high risk group, there was significant statistical difference between above mentioned 3 groups (P < 0.001). The MRD analysis at different time points showed that the higher the MRD level, the lower the 3-year EFS rate of children with ALL, in which the 3-year EFS rate of MRD >/= 10(-2) at day 15, MRD >/= 10(-3) at day 33 and MRD >/= 10(-3) at week 12 were significantly lower. The MRD >/= 10(-3) at week 12 was proven to be an independent predictor by multivariate Cox proportional-hazards regression model.

It is concluded that dynamically monitoring MRD by multi-parameter flow cytometry can precisely evaluate treatment response, judge treatment outcome and predict relapse in childhood B-ALL. The MRD 10(-2) at day 15, MRD 10(-3) at day 33 and MRD 10(-3) at week 12 should be considered as the best cut-off.

The bone marrow of 216 patients with AML were detected by using PCR and R-banding methods. On basis of patients' clinical data the clinical feature and prognosis were analyzed. The results showed that in 216 AML patients incidence of FLT3-ITD mutation was 20.83%. FLT3-ITD mutation was present in 24% patients with normal karyotype while in 12.5% patients with abnormal karyotype. The FLT3-ITD positive patients had more white blood cells in peripheral blood and leukemia cells in bone marrow (P < 0.01). The free-disease survival and overall survival time were shorter in FLT3-ITD positive cases than that in FLT3-ITD negative cases (P < 0.05). It is concluded that FLT3-ITD mutation positive patients have more white blood cells in peripheral blood and leukemia cells in bone marrow. The FLT3-ITD mutation may be a danger factor in the AML patients with normal karyotype.

This study presents a case study of an economic model developed to assess the cost-effectiveness of posaconazole vs standard azole therapy (fluconazole/itraconazole) to prevent invasive fungal infections (IFIs), which was adapted by at least 11 countries. METHODS: Modeling techniques were used to assess the cost-effectiveness of posaconazole vs fluconazole/itraconazole as IFI prophylaxis in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia or myelodysplastic syndromes and chemotherapy-induced neutropenia. For the core model, the probabilities of experiencing an IFI, IFI-related death, and death from other causes were estimated from clinical trial data. Long-term mortality, drug costs, and IFI treatment costs were obtained from secondary sources. Locally changed parameters were probabilities of long-term death and survival, currency, drug costs, health utility, IFI treatment costs, and discount rate. RESULTS: Locally adapted cost-effective modeling studies indicate that prophylaxis with posaconazole, compared with fluconazole/itraconazole, prolongs survival, and, in most countries, is cost-saving. In all countries, the model predicted that prophylaxis with posaconazole would be associated with an increase in life-years, with increases ranging from 0.016-0.1 life-year saved. In all countries, use of the model led to posaconazole being approved by the appropriate reimbursement authority. LIMITATIONS: The study did not have power to detect differences between posaconazole and fluconazole or itraconazole separately. The risk of death after 100 days was assumed to be equal for those who did and did not develop an IFI, and equal probabilities of IFI-related and other death during the trial period were used for both groups. CONCLUSIONS: A core economic model was successfully adapted locally by several countries. The model showed that posaconazole was cost-saving or cost-effective vs fluconazole/itraconazole and led to positive reimbursement listings.",,"['Papadopoulos, George', 'Hunt, Sheena', 'Prasad, Manishi']","['Papadopoulos G', 'Hunt S', 'Prasad M']","['Emerald Corporate Group Pty Ltd, McMahons Point, NSW, Australia. george@emerald-cg.com']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130108,England,J Med Econ,Journal of medical economics,9892255,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Triazoles)', '304NUG5GF4 (Itraconazole)', '6TK1G07BHZ (posaconazole)', '8VZV102JFY (Fluconazole)']",IM,,"['Antifungal Agents/*economics/therapeutic use', 'Cost-Benefit Analysis', '*Developed Countries', 'Drug Therapy, Combination/*economics', 'Fluconazole/*economics/therapeutic use', 'Fungi/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Itraconazole/*economics/therapeutic use', '*Models, Economic', 'Mycoses/*drug therapy', 'Triazoles/*economics/therapeutic use']",,,2012/12/22 06:00,2013/08/08 06:00,['2012/12/22 06:00'],"['2012/12/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/12/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3111/13696998.2012.761633 [doi]'],ppublish,J Med Econ. 2013;16(3):374-80. doi: 10.3111/13696998.2012.761633.

Literature contains a number of publications on the effects of lenalidomide in myelodysplastic syndrome, in malignant lymphomas and chronic B lymphocytic leukaemia. The effects of the drug in rare diseases, however, have not been investigated so far. In this paper, we summarize our experience with lenalidomide in rare blood disorders. We observed an excellent effect of lenalidomide in multifocal aggressive, repeatedly relapsing Langerhans cell histiocytosis where it led to complete remission. This patient was treated with 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine and with CHOEP (cyclophosphamide, etoposide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone) chemotherapy and high dose BEAM chemotherapy with autologous transplantation of haematopoietic tissue for an early disease relapse. Following another early relapse, the patient was treated with lenalidomide (25 mg). Treatment with lenalidomide induced complete remission on PET-CT. The patient was consolidated during the remission with a reduced intensity conditioning regimen and allogeneic transplantation of haematopoietic tissue. Following allogeneic transplantation, the patient has been in full remission for 10 months. We further showed an excellent effect of lenalidomide in multicentric Castleman disease with generalized involvement of lymphatic nodes, B symptoms and vasculitis. The patient was first treated R-CHOP chemotherapy (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, adriamycin, vincristine and prednisone). Due to a lack of efficacy, this was changed to the CVD combination (cyclophosphamide, thalidomide, dexamethazone). This treatment delivered complete remission but was complicated by thalidomide-associated neuropathy. Due to persistent neuropathy, thalidomide could not be used to manage further relapse and thus lenalidomide (25 mg, 11 cycles) was used. The patient has been in complete PET-CT remission for 7 months following this treatment. We observed partial efficacy in Erdheim-Chester disease. We used 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine as part of initial treatment that delivered partial regression of brain infiltrates only; fluorodeoxyglucose accumulation in the bones has not changed. Lenalidomide 25 mg was used as second line treatment. This led to complete regression of CNS infiltrates on MRI but fluorodeoxyglucose accumulation in bone lesions did not change. Regression of clinical signs and regression of fibrosis of retroperitoneum was achieved with an ongoing treatment with anakinra. A patient with multiple angiomatosis affecting the abdominal cavity, mediastinum and vertebrae and digestive tract had been stabilized with zoledronate (4 mg once every 2 months) and thalidomide (100 - 200 mg/den) for several years. However, several years of this treatment led to severe neuropathy. Consequently, we attempted to substitute thalidomide for lenalidomide. However, 10 mg of lenalidomide alone was not sufficiently effective and thus low dose of 50 mg of thalidomide was added. Combined treatment with zoledronate, lenalidomide 10 mg/day and thalidomide 50 mg/day stabilized the condition for 9 months. Due to relapsed gastrointestinal bleeding the treatment had to be changed after 9 months to thalidomide 100 mg/day and Sandostatin 0.1 mg twice daily s.c. A patient with osteosclerotic myeloma and POEMS syndrome was initially treated with CAD chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide, adriamycine and dexamethazone) that was followed by tandem high dose chemotherapy (melphalan 100 mg/m2) and autologous transplantation. Treatment with thalidomide was given due to insufficient efficacy but was not tolerated. Lenalidomide was administered as the fourth line treatment. Even though literature describes remission of POEMS syndrome following lenalidomide, four cycles did not lead to remission in our patient. CONCLUSION: We showed an effect of lenalidomide in Langerhans cell histiocytosis and in Castleman disease.

Therefore, a series of copper(II) mixed-ligand complexes of the type [Cu(qui)(L)]Y . xH2O (1-6), where Hqui = 2-phenyl-3-hydroxy-4(1H)-quinolinone, Y = NO3 (1, 3, 5) or BF4 (2, 4, 6), and L = 1,10-phenanthroline (phen) (1, 2), 5-methyl-1,10-phenanthroline (mphen) (3, 4) and bathophenanthroline (bphen) (5, 6), was studied for their in vitro cytotoxicity against several human cancer cell lines (A549 lung carcinoma, HeLa cervix epitheloid carcinoma, G361 melanoma cells, A2780 ovarian carcinoma, A2780cis cisplatin-resistant ovarian carcinoma, LNCaP androgen-sensitive prostate adenocarcinoma and THP-1 monocytic leukemia). RESULTS: The tested complexes displayed a stronger cytotoxic effect against all the cancer cells as compared to cisplatin. The highest cytotoxicity was found for the complexes 4 (IC50 = 0.36 +/- 0.05 muM and 0.56 +/- 0.15 muM), 5 (IC50 = 0.66 +/- 0.07 muM and 0.73 +/- 0.08 muM) and 6 (IC50 = 0.57 +/- 0.11 muM and 0.70 +/- 0.20 muM) against A2780, and A2780cis respectively, as compared with the values of 12.0 +/- 0.8 muM and 27.0 +/- 4.6 muM determined for cisplatin. Moreover, the tested complexes were much less cytotoxic to primary human hepatocytes than to the cancer cells. The complexes 5 and 6 exhibited significantly high ability to modulate secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha (2873 +/- 238 pg/mL and 3284 +/- 139 pg/mL for 5, and 6 respectively) and IL-1beta (1177 +/- 128 pg/mL and 1087 +/- 101 pg/mL for 5, and 6 respectively) tested on the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated THP-1 cells as compared with the values of 1173 +/- 85 pg/mL and 118.5 +/- 4.8 pg/mL found for the commercially used anti-inflammatory drug prednisone. The ability of the tested complexes to interact with sulfur-containing biomolecules (cysteine and reduced glutathione) at physiological levels was proved by electrospray-ionization mass spectrometry. CONCLUSIONS: Overall positive results of the biological activity studies revealed that the presented complexes may represent good candidates for non-platinum anticancer drugs, however, we are aware of the fact that further and deeper studies mainly in relation to the elucidation of their mechanisms of antiproliferative action will be necessary.",,"['Travnicek, Zdenek', 'Vanco, Jan', 'Hosek, Jan', 'Buchtik, Roman', 'Dvorak, Zdenek']","['Travnicek Z', 'Vanco J', 'Hosek J', 'Buchtik R', 'Dvorak Z']","['Department of Inorganic Chemistry, Regional Centre of Advanced Technologies and Materials, Palacky University, 17, listopadu 1192/12, Olomouc, CZ-771 46, Czech Republic. zdenek.travnicek@upol.cz.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20121220,England,Chem Cent J,Chemistry Central journal,101314213,,,,,PMC3556092,,2012/12/22 06:00,2012/12/22 06:01,['2012/12/22 06:00'],"['2012/10/17 00:00 [received]', '2012/12/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/12/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/12/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/22 06:01 [medline]']","['1752-153X-6-160 [pii]', '10.1186/1752-153X-6-160 [doi]']",epublish,Chem Cent J. 2012 Dec 20;6(1):160. doi: 10.1186/1752-153X-6-160.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chemoimmunotherapy (CIT) combining rituximab and fludarabine with cyclophosphamide (FCR) in the frontline setting has clearly been shown to improve outcomes in patients with CLL. Building on the success achieved with rituximab, other anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are being investigated. Novel bioengineering techniques have helped in the development of anti-CD20 mAbs. One antibody, ofatumumab, was recently approved for the treatment of refractory CLL. A type II anti-CD20 mAb, GA-101 (obinutuzumab), is currently in clinical trials. This short review focuses on ongoing clinical trials of anti-CD20 mAbs in CLL. AREAS COVERED: Literature search was performed using PubMed ( www.clinicaltrials.gov (till August 2012)), and recent American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), American Society of Hematology (ASH), European Hematology association (EHA), International workshop on CLL (iwCLL) abstracts, using the primary search terms 'anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody' with/without CLL. Articles were chosen on the basis of relevance of anti-CD20 mAbs to CLL therapy. EXPERT OPINION: Rituximab, the prototype anti-CD20 mAb, forms the core of CIT in CLL.

ATLL is refractory to treatment with conventional chemotherapy and fewer than 10% of afflicted individuals survive more than 5 years after diagnosis. HTLV-1 encodes a viral oncoprotein, Tax, that functions in transforming virus-infected T-cells into leukemic cells. All ATLL cases are believed to have reduced p53 activity although only a minority of ATLLs have genetic mutations in their p53 gene. It has been suggested that p53 function is inactivated by the Tax protein. RESULTS: Using genetically altered mice, we report here that Tax expression does not achieve a functional equivalence of p53 inactivation as that seen with genetic mutation of p53 (i.e. a p53 -/- genotype). Thus, we find statistically significant differences in tumorigenesis between Tax+p53 +/+ versus Tax+p53 -/- mice. We also find a role contributed by the cellular Wip1 phosphatase protein in tumor formation in Tax transgenic mice. Notably, Tax+Wip1 -/- mice show statistically significant reduced prevalence of tumorigenesis compared to Tax+Wip1 +/+ counterparts.

Previous studies have shown that p33(ING1b) is involved in the restriction of cell growth and proliferation, apoptosis, tumor anchorage-independent growth, cellular senescence, maintenance of genomic stability and modulation of cell cycle checkpoints. Loss of nuclear p33(ING1b) has been observed in melanoma, seminoma, papillary thyroid carcinoma, oral squamous cell carcinoma, breast ductal cancer and acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Inactivation and/or decreased expression of p33(ING1b) have been reported in various types of cancer, including head and neck squamous cell, breast, lung, stomach, blood and brain malignancies. Since little is known about the clinicopathological significance of p33(ING1b) in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), this study aimed to investigate the association of p33(ING1b) expression with clinicopathological variables and particularly interesting new cysteine-histidine rich protein (PINCH) in patients with ESCC. p33(ING1b) expression was examined by immunohistochemistry in 20 normal esophageal mucosa and in 64 ESCC specimens. The results revealed that the positive expression of p33(ING1b) protein in normal squamous cells was localized in the nucleus alone and the positive rate was 95%, while in ESCCs, the positive expression was mainly in the cytoplasm, together with nuclear expression, and the positive rate was 36% (P<0.0001). Furthermore, the cases with lymph node metastasis showed a higher frequency of positive cytoplasmic expression than those without metastasis (P=0.001). The cytoplasmic expression of p33(ING1b) was positively related to PINCH expression (P<0.0001) in ESCC, and the cases positive for both proteins had a high lymph node metastasis rate (P=0.001). In conclusion, p33(ING1b) cellular compartmental shift from the nucleus to the cytoplasm may cause loss of normal cellular function and play a central role in the tumorigenesis and metastasis of ESCC.",,"['Zhu, Zhen-Long', 'Yan, Bao-Yong', 'Zhang, Yu', 'Yang, Yan-Hong', 'Wang, Zheng-Min', 'Zhang, Hong-Zhen', 'Wang, Ming-Wei', 'Zhang, Xiang-Hong', 'Sun, Xiao-Feng']","['Zhu ZL', 'Yan BY', 'Zhang Y', 'Yang YH', 'Wang ZM', 'Zhang HZ', 'Wang MW', 'Zhang XH', 'Sun XF']","['Department of Pathology, The First Hospital of Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, Hebei 050031; ; Graduate School of Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, Hebei 050017;']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20121022,Greece,Oncol Lett,Oncology letters,101531236,,,,,PMC3525348,,2012/12/21 06:00,2012/12/21 06:01,['2012/12/21 06:00'],"['2012/07/23 00:00 [received]', '2012/10/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/12/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/12/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/21 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3892/ol.2012.983 [doi]', 'ol-05-01-0161 [pii]']",ppublish,Oncol Lett. 2013 Jan;5(1):161-166. doi: 10.3892/ol.2012.983.

However, the function of PARP-1 in retroviral DNA integration is controversial, probably due to the functional redundancy of the PARP family in mammalian cells. We evaluated the function of PARP-1 in retroviral infection using the chicken B lymphoblastoid cell line DT40. These cells lack significant PARP-1 functional redundancy and efficiently support the postentry early events of the mammalian-retrovirus replication cycle. We observed that DT40 PARP-1(-/-) cells were 9- and 6-fold more susceptible to infection by human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)- and murine leukemia virus (MLV)-derived viral vectors, respectively, than cells expressing PARP-1. Production of avian Rous-associated virus type 1 was also impaired by PARP-1. However, the susceptibilities of these cell lines to infection by the nonretrovirus vesicular stomatitis virus were indistinguishable. Real-time PCR analysis of the HIV-1 life cycle demonstrated that PARP-1 did not impair reverse transcription, nuclear import of the preintegration complex, or viral DNA integration, suggesting that PARP-1 regulates a postintegration step. In support of this hypothesis, pharmacological inhibition of the epigenetic mechanism of transcriptional silencing increased retroviral expression in PARP-1-expressing cells, suppressing the differences observed. Further analysis of the implicated molecular mechanism indicated that PARP-1-mediated retroviral silencing requires the C-terminal region, but not the enzymatic activity, of the protein. In sum, our data indicate a novel role of PARP-1 in the transcriptional repression of integrated retroviruses.",,"['Bueno, Murilo T D', 'Reyes, Daniel', 'Valdes, Luis', 'Saheba, Adarsh', 'Urias, Eduardo', 'Mendoza, Crystal', 'Fregoso, Oliver I', 'Llano, Manuel']","['Bueno MT', 'Reyes D', 'Valdes L', 'Saheba A', 'Urias E', 'Mendoza C', 'Fregoso OI', 'Llano M']","['Department of Biological Sciences, University of Texas at El Paso, El Paso, Texas, USA.']",['eng'],"['5R25GM069621-09/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', '5G12RR008124/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'G12 RR008124/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'SC1 AI098238/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R25 GM069621/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', '5 SC1 AI098238-02/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20121219,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['EC 2.4.2.30 (PARP1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (PARP2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly (ADP-Ribose) Polymerase-1)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Avian Leukosis Virus/genetics/pathogenicity/physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Chickens', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Gene Knockout Techniques', 'HEK293 Cells', 'HIV-1/genetics/pathogenicity/physiology', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics/pathogenicity/physiology', 'Poly (ADP-Ribose) Polymerase-1', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Retroviridae/*genetics/pathogenicity/physiology', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Vesicular stomatitis Indiana virus/genetics/pathogenicity/physiology', 'Virus Integration/genetics', 'Virus Replication/*genetics']",PMC3571415,,2012/12/21 06:00,2013/04/25 06:00,['2012/12/21 06:00'],"['2012/12/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/12/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/25 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.01668-12 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.01668-12 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2013 Mar;87(5):2496-507. doi: 10.1128/JVI.01668-12.

Such MSCs promoted short-term CLL-cell survival in either 5% or ambient O2. However, longer-term CLL-cell survival was enhanced when the cocultures were maintained in 5% O2 versus 21% O2 because of increased MSC proliferation and production of soluble prosurvival factors, such as CXCL12.

In the T-ALL leukemia mouse model described in our recent study (Hu X, et al. Blood 2009), the impacts of leukemic environment on normal hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) were distinct, in that normal HSCs were preserved in part because of increased mitotic quiescence of HSCs and resulting exhaustion of HPCs proliferation. Stem cell factor (SCF) secreted by leukemic cells in Nalm6 B-ALL model was previously suggested to force normal HSCs/HPCs out of their bone marrow niches and allow leukemic cells to occupy the niches (Colmone A, et al. Science 2008). Here we found that stem cell factor (SCF) expression in PB and BM of T-ALL model was increased, but SCF mRNA and protein levels in normal hematopoietic cells were higher than those in leukemia cells, which suggested that upregulated SCF was mainly contributed by non-leukemic cells in response to the leukemia development. To further elucidate the molecular mechanisms, microarray analysis was conducted on normal HSCs in this model and verified by real-time RT-PCR. The expression of Hes1 and its downstream target p21 were elevated in normal HSCs, whereas their expression showed no significant alteration in HPCs. Interestingly, although overexpression of Hes1 by retroviral infection inhibited the in vitro colony formation of normal hematopoietic cells, in vivo results demonstrated that normal Lin(-) cells and HSPCs were better preserved when normal Lin(-) cells with Hes1 overexpression were co-transplanted with T-ALL leukemia cells. Our results suggested that the differential expression of Hes1 between HSCs and HPCs resulted in the distinct responses of these cells to the leukemic condition, and that overexpression of Hes1 could enhance normal HSPCs in the leukemic environment.",,"['Tian, Chen', 'Zheng, Guoguang', 'Cao, Zhipan', 'Li, Qiao', 'Ju, Zhenyu', 'Wang, Jinhong', 'Yuan, Weiping', 'Cheng, Tao']","['Tian C', 'Zheng G', 'Cao Z', 'Li Q', 'Ju Z', 'Wang J', 'Yuan W', 'Cheng T']","['State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120115,United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Hes1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Notch1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '0 (Transcription Factor HES-1)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/metabolism/*physiopathology', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Receptor, Notch1/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Stem Cell Factor/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factor HES-1']",PMC3575461,,2012/12/21 06:00,2013/07/17 06:00,['2012/12/21 06:00'],"['2012/12/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/12/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/17 06:00 [medline]']","['23160 [pii]', '10.4161/cc.23160 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2013 Jan 15;12(2):322-31. doi: 10.4161/cc.23160.

Thus, the development of selective glucocorticoid receptor (GR) activators (SEGRA) with improved therapeutic index is important. GR regulates gene expression via (1) transactivation that requires GR homodimer binding to gene promoters and is linked to side effects and (2) transrepression-mediated via negative GR interaction with other transcription factors. Novel GR modulator Compound A (CpdA) prevents GR dimerization, retains glucocorticoid anti-inflammatory activity and has fewer side effects compared with glucocorticoids in vivo. Here we tested CpdA anticancer activity in human T- and B-lymphoma and multiple myeloma cells expressing GR and their counterparts with silenced GR. We found that CpdA in GR-dependent manner strongly inhibited growth and viability of human T-, B-lymphoma and multiple myeloma cells. Furthermore, primary leukemia cell cultures from T-ALL patients appeared to be equally sensitive to glucocorticoid dexamethasone and CpdA. It is known that GR expression is controlled by proteasome. We showed that pretreatment of lymphoma CEM and NCEB cells with proteasome-inhibitor Bortezomib resulted in GR accumulation and enhanced ligand properties of CpdA, shifting GR activity toward transrepression evaluated by inhibition of NFsmall ka, CyrillicB and AP-1 transcription factors. We also revealed remarkable GR-dependent cooperation between CpdA and Bortezomib in suppressing growth and survival of T- and B-lymphoma and multiple myeloma MM.1S cells.

Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is caused by a chromosome translocation that generates the BCRABL oncogene encoding a constitutively active protein tyrosine kinase. The disease originates in a hematopoietic stem cell and is maintained by leukemic stem cells (LSCs). Treatment with specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors does not eliminate LSCs because they do not depend on the oncogene for survival. We have combined a switchable p53 knock-in mouse model, p53 (KI/KI) , with the well-characterized Sca1-BCRABLp210 CML transgenic model, to show that transient restoration of p53 slows disease progression and significantly extends the survival of leukemic animals, being the mechanism responsible for this effect, apoptotic death of primitive leukemia cells. In agreement with these in vivo findings, in vitro assays show that restoring p53 reduces hematopoietic colony formation by cells of leukemic animals.

METHODS: It was an observational descriptive study conducted between February 2009 through July 2010. Febrile neutropenic episodes satisfying the inclusion criteria were enrolled. Relevant history was taken followed by a detailed clinical examination and laboratory examination. Logistic Regression analysis was used to identify significant predictors of adverse outcome in febrile neutropenic episodes. RESULTS: Out of the 155 febrile neutropenic episodes studied, adverse outcome occurred in 53(34 %) of the episodes. History of three or more previous episodes of febrile neutropenia, child being already on oral antibiotics and Chest Radiograph abnormality at presentation were found to be significantly associated with adverse outcome on multivariate logistic regression analysis. Documented invasive bacterial and fungal infection was seen in 27.8 % and 14.2 % episodes. Mortality occurred in 8 (5 %) of episodes. Gram negative bacterial infections were more common. Most common bacteria isolated was Escherichia coli and the commonest gram positive organism isolated was Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA).

However, the mechanisms of the combined effects of cotylenin A and rapamycin are still unknown. Activated Akt induced by rapamycin has been suggested to attenuate the growth-inhibitory effects of rapamycin, serving as a negative feedback mechanism. In this study, we found that cotylenin A could suppress rapamycin-induced phosphorylation of Akt (Ser473) in MCF-7 cells and lung carcinoma A549 cells and that cotylenin A also enhanced the rapamycin-induced growth inhibition of MCF-7 and A549 cells. ISIR-005 (a synthetic cotylenin A-derivative) was able to enhance rapamycininduced growth inhibition and could also markedly inhibit rapamycin-induced phosphorylation of Akt. We also found that the HSP90 inhibitor 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) or arsenic trioxide (ATO) in combination with rapamycin markedly inhibited the growth of MCF-7 cells and 17-AAG or ATO suppressed rapamycin-induced phosphorylation of Akt. The PI3K inhibitor LY294002 also suppressed rapamycin-induced phosphorylation of Akt and combined treatment showed synergistic growth inhibition of MCF-7 cells. Rapamycin inhibited growth more significantly in Akt siRNA-transfected MCF-7 cells than in control siRNA-transfected MCF-7 cells.

Previous study has shown that Jolkinolide B could induce apoptosis in human leukemia cells. However, the exact mechanism and signaling pathway involved in Jolkinolide B-induced apoptosis have not been fully elucidated. In the present study, we found that Jolkinolide B reduced cell viability and induced apoptosis in dose- and time-dependent manner in human leukemic HL-60 and THP-1 cells. The induction of apoptosis was accompanied by the downregulation of JAK2/STAT3. Our results also suggest that expression of Bcl-2 and mitochondrial cytochrome c was dosedependently reduced following Jolkinolide B-treated THP-1 and HL-60 cells, whereas Jolkinolide B up-regulated the expression of Bax and cytosolic cytochrome c. Moreover, we observed that Jolkinolide B treatment resulted in activation of caspase-3, -8, and -9. JSI-124, a STAT-3 inhibitor, was able to block the negative effect of Jolkinolide B on cell apoptosis. Taken together, our study for the first time suggests that Jolkinolide B is able to enhance apoptosis of human leukemic HL-60 and THP-1 cells, at least in part, through downregulation of JAK2/STAT3 and bcl-2, and upregulation of Bax and cytosolic cytochrome c.

Among previous reports, the Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo (IMSUT) has reported remarkably favorable results of CBT for hematologic malignancies as a single-institute experience. The aim of the present multicenter prospective study was to assess the safety and efficacy of CBT performed precisely according to IMSUT transplantation procedures. Thirty-three adult patients with hematologic malignancies, such as acute leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia, or myelodysplastic syndrome, either lacking an HLA-identical sibling/HLA-matched unrelated donor or requiring urgent transplantation were enrolled. Conditioning consisted of total body irradiation (12 Gy), cytarabine, and cyclophosphamide. Cyclosporine A and methotrexate were used for GVHD prophylaxis. Diagnoses were acute leukemia in 26 patients, chronic myelogenous leukemia in 4, and myelodysplastic syndrome in 3; 12 patients were in first complete remission, and the others were in advanced stages at the time of CBT. Thirty-one patients achieved engraftment, and the cumulative incidence of grade II-IV acute GVHD was 45% (95% confidence interval, 28%-62%). With a median follow-up of 46.2 months in 16 surviving patients, the 1-year cumulative incidence of nonrelapse mortality was 15% (95% confidence interval, 5%-30%). Causes of nonrelapse mortality were infection (n = 4) and graft failure (n = 1). The overall and disease-free survival rates were 51% (95% CI, 34%-68%) and 42% (95% CI, 26%-59%), respectively. These results suggest that the IMSUT CBT procedures can safely provide a high disease-free survival rate in patients with high-risk hematologic malignancies.","['Copyright (c) 2013 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

These data characterize the patient experience after HCT and may have prognostic usefulness for long-term outcomes after HCT. We conducted a study of 32 patients after HCT (10 autologous HCT recipients, 11 full-intensity conditioning allogeneic HCT recipients, and 11 reduced-intensity conditioning allogeneic HCT recipients) to determine the feasibility of weekly electronic PRO collection from HCT until day (D) +100. We used questions from the PRO version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events to capture symptoms, and the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Global Health scale to measure physical and mental HRQOL. The vast majority (94%) of patients used the electronic PRO system, with only 6% opting for paper-and-pencil only. The median weekly percentage of participants who completed the surveys was 100% in all cohorts through hospital discharge, and remained 100% for the autologous HCT and reduced-intensity allogeneic HCT cohorts through D+100. Patients were satisfied with the electronic system, giving high marks for readability, comfort, and questionnaire length. Symptom severity varied by absolute level and type of symptom across the 3 cohorts, with the full-intensity allogeneic HCT cohort exhibiting the greatest median overall symptom severity, peaking at D+7. Median physical health HRQOL scores decreased with time in the 3 cohorts, and HRQOL was generally correlated with overall symptom severity. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of frequent electronic PROs in the early post-HCT period. Future studies in larger populations to explore predictive models using frequent PRO data for outcomes, including long-term HRQOL and survival, are warranted.","['Copyright (c) 2013 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.

Given that there is a tendency for IFI to occur after bacteremia following febrile episodes during neutropenia, the aim of this study was to determine if bacteremia was a predictive factor for IFI in pediatric patients with hematologic and malignant disease. METHODS: Sixty-two patients (32 boys, 30 girls; median age, 4 years) with hematologic or malignant disease who had received chemotherapy, immunosuppressive therapy, and/or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and experienced febrile episodes during neutropenia were enrolled. In patient-based analysis, clinical features of 62 patients were compared between those with and without IFI. Meanwhile, in febrile episode-based analysis, clinical features were analyzed for 268 febrile episodes occurring during neutropenia in the 62 patients. RESULTS: Patient-based analysis showed that relapse of original disease and acute myeloid leukemia were risk factors for IFI. Meanwhile, febrile episode-based analysis identified bacteremia following febrile episodes during neutropenia as a potential risk factor for IFI. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report to identify bacteremia following febrile episodes during neutropenia as a predictive factor for IFI in pediatric patients with hematologic or malignant disease.

Median MDR1 mRNA expression in pretreated bone marrow cells was used as the cutoff point for high and low MDR1 expression. RESULTS: A total of 59.7% high and 77.8% low MDR1 expressers achieved complete remission (CR; p = 0.029). Idarubicin yielded a higher CR rate than daunorubicin in high MDR1 expressers (82.1 vs 41.2%; p = 0.001), it also demonstrated a higher CR rate than daunorubicin (p < 0.05) in high MDR1 expressers exhibiting favorable or intermediate risk, while there was no difference between the two treatment arms in low MDR1 expressers exhibiting either favorable or intermediate risk.

The aim of this study was to investigate TPMT phenotype-genotype concordance in ALL, and the influence of TPMT on thiopurine metabolite formation. METHODS: We measured TPMT (activity, as units ml(-1) packed RBCs and genotype) at diagnosis (n = 1150) and TPMT and thioguanine nucleotide (TGN) and methylmercaptopurine nucleotide (MeMPN) metabolites (pmol/8 x 10(8) RBCs) during chemotherapy (n = 1131) in children randomized to thioguanine or mercaptopurine on the United Kingdom trial ALL97. RESULTS: Median TPMT activity at diagnosis (8.5 units) was significantly lower than during chemotherapy (13.8 units, median difference 5.1 units, 95% confidence interval (CI) 4.8, 5.4, P < 0.0001). At diagnosis genotype-phenotype was discordant. During chemotherapy the overall concordance was 92%, but this fell to 55% in the intermediate activity cohort (45% had wild-type genotypes). For both thiopurines TGN concentrations differed by TPMT status. For mercaptopurine, median TGNs were higher in TPMT heterozygous genotype (754 pmol) than wild-type (360 pmol) patients (median difference 406 pmol, 95% CI 332, 478, P < 0.0001), whilst median MeMPNs, products of the TPMT reaction, were higher in wild-type (10 650 pmol) than heterozygous patients (3868 pmol) (P < 0.0001). In TPMT intermediate activity patients with a wild-type genotype, TGN (median 366 pmol) and MeMPN (median 8590 pmol) concentrations were similar to those in wild-type, high activity patients. CONCLUSIONS: In childhood ALL, TPMT activity should not be used to predict heterozygosity particularly in blood samples obtained at disease diagnosis. Genotype is a better predictor of TGN accumulation during chemotherapy.","['(c) 2012 The Authors.

Genetic polymorphism of the TPMT gene correlates with activity of this enzyme, individual reaction, and dosing of thiopurines. Thirty-one variants of the TPMT gene with low enzymatic activity have been described with three major alleles: TPMT*2 (c.238G>C), *3A (c.460 G>A, c.719A>G), and *3C (c.719A>G), accounting for 80% to 95% of inherited TPMT deficiency in different populations in the world. The aim of the study was to establish a rapid and highly sensitive method of analysis for the complete coding sequence of the TPMT gene and to determine the spectrum and prevalence of the TPMT gene sequence variations in the Polish population. Recently, high-resolution melting analysis (HRMA) has become a highly sensitive, automated, and economical technique for mutation screening or genotyping. We applied HRMA for the first time to TPMT gene scanning. In total, we analyzed 548 alleles of the Polish population. We found 11 different sequence variations, where two are novel changes: c.200T>C (p.P67S, TPMT*30) and c.595G>A (p.V199I, TPMT*31). Detection of these new rare alleles TPMT*30 and *31 in the Polish population suggests the need to analyze the whole TPMT gene and maybe also the extension of routinely used tests containing three major alleles, TPMT*2, *3A, and *3C. Identification of sequence variants using HRMA is highly sensitive and less time consuming compared to standard sequencing.

Here we applied MPS for the detection of rare, clinically relevant mutations in a chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) patient. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors revolutionized CML therapy but in some patients the disease progresses due to resistance-conferring mutations. MPS was applied herein to monitor such mutations in BCR-ABL1 transcripts at different time points. The large volume of sequencing data increases sensitivity compared to direct sequencing and allows detection of marginally represented and previously uncharacterized mutations.

SYT-SSX breakpoint peptide vaccines in patients with synovial sarcoma: a study from the Japanese Musculoskeletal Oncology Group. Cancer Sci. 103(9), 1625-1630 (2012). The identification of genetic translocations as key tumor-initiating events has led to the development of novel antigen-specific vaccines targeting these tumor-specific breakpoint regions. Previous studies have evaluated vaccines targeting the breakpoints in the BCR-ABL translocation in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia and EWS-FLI1 in patients with Ewing sarcoma. In the article under evaluation, the authors evaluated a peptide vaccine targeting the breakpoint in the SYT-SSX translocation, the genetic translocation essentially pathognomonic for synovial sarcoma. This is the second small clinical trial reported by this group using HLA-A24-binding peptides as vaccine antigens. In this four-arm trial, using a native or HLA-A24-optimized SYT-SSX peptide with or without adjuvant plus IFN-alpha, they immunized patients with metastatic synovial sarcoma. Immune responses were evaluated by delayed-type hypersensitivity testing and tetramer analysis. No robust evidence of immune response to the target epitope was detected. Some patients treated with peptide in adjuvant plus IFN-alpha had stable disease. These results suggest that future similar studies might best evaluate patients with a lower burden of disease, consider alternative immunization approaches to the SYT-SSX target antigen and consider the efficacy of IFN-alpha alone for the treatment of synovial sarcoma.",,"['Bloom, Jordan E', 'McNeel, Douglas G', 'Olson, Brian M']","['Bloom JE', 'McNeel DG', 'Olson BM']","['University of Wisconsin Carbone Cancer Center, 1111 Highland Avenue, Madison, WI 53705, USA.']",['eng'],['R01 CA142608/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Comment', 'Journal Article']",,England,Expert Rev Vaccines,Expert review of vaccines,101155475,,,,,PMC3556272,['NIHMS436422'],2012/12/21 06:00,2012/12/21 06:01,['2012/12/21 06:00'],"['2012/12/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/12/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/21 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1586/erv.12.122 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Rev Vaccines. 2012 Dec;11(12):1401-4. doi: 10.1586/erv.12.122.,,,,,,,['Cancer Sci. 2012 Sep;103(9):1625-30.

The oncogenic transcription factor EVI1 is involved in methylation deregulation and its overexpression plays a major role for predicting an adverse outcome. Moreover, the identification of DNMT3A mutations in AML patients has recently been described as a poor prognostic indicator. In order to clarify relationship between these key actors in methylation mechanisms and their potential impact on patient outcomes, we analysed 195 de novo AML patients for the expression of DNMT3A, 3B (and its non-catalytic variant 3B(NC)) and their correlations with the outcome and the expression of other common prognostic genetic biomarkers (EVI1, NPM1, FLT3ITD/TKD and MLL) in adult AML. The overexpression of DNMT3B/3B(NC) is (i) significantly correlated with a shorter overall survival, and (ii) inversely significantly correlated with event-free survival and DNMT3A expression level. Moreover, multivariate analysis showed that a high expression level of DNMT3B/3B(NC) is statistically a significant independent poor prognostic indicator. This study represents the first report showing that the overexpression of DNMT3B/3B(NC) is an independent predictor of poor survival in AML.

The treatment of ALL leukemic cells with sulforaphane resulted in dose-dependent apoptosis and G2/M cell cycle arrest, which was associated with the activation of caspases (3, 8, and 9), inactivation of PARP, p53-independent upregulation of p21(CIP1/WAF1), and inhibition of the Cdc2/Cyclin B1 complex. Interestingly, sulforaphane also inhibited the AKT and mTOR survival pathways in most of the tested cell lines by lowering the levels of both total and phosphorylated proteins.

A yeast two-hybrid approach was used to discover novel MTG binding partners. This screen identified the Zinc fingers, C2H2 and BTB domain containing (ZBTB) family members ZBTB4 and ZBTB38 as MTG16 interacting proteins. ZBTB4 is downregulated in breast cancer and modulates p53 responses. Because ZBTB33 (Kaiso), like MTG16, modulates Wnt signaling at the level of TCF4, and its deletion suppresses intestinal tumorigenesis in the Apc(Min) mouse, we determined that Kaiso also interacted with MTG16 to modulate transcription. The zinc finger domains of Kaiso as well as ZBTB4 and ZBTB38 bound MTG16 and the association with Kaiso was confirmed using co-immunoprecipitation. MTG family members were required to efficiently repress both a heterologous reporter construct containing Kaiso binding sites (4xKBS) and the known Kaiso target, Matrix metalloproteinase-7 (MMP-7/Matrilysin). Moreover, chromatin immunoprecipitation studies placed MTG16 in a complex occupying the Kaiso binding site on the MMP-7 promoter. The presence of MTG16 in this complex, and its contributions to transcriptional repression both required Kaiso binding to its binding site on DNA, establishing MTG16-Kaiso binding as functionally relevant in Kaiso-dependent transcriptional repression. Examination of a large multi-stage CRC expression array dataset revealed patterns of Kaiso, MTG16, and MMP-7 expression supporting the hypothesis that loss of either Kaiso or MTG16 can de-regulate a target promoter such as that of MMP-7.

The importance of microRNA (miRNA) in the replicative cycle of several other viruses, as well as in the progression of associated pathologies, has been well established in the past decade. Moreover, involvement of miRNA alteration in the HTLV-1 life cycle, and in the progression of its related oncogenic and neurodegenerative diseases, has recently come to light. Several HTLV-1 derived proteins alter transcription factor functionalities, interact with chromatin remodelers, or manipulate components of the RNA interference (RNAi) machinery, thereby establishing various routes by which miRNA expression can be up- or down-regulated in the host cell. Furthermore, the mechanism of action through which dysregulation of host miRNAs affects HTLV-1 infected cells can vary substantially and include mRNA silencing via the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), transcriptional gene silencing, inhibition of RNAi components, and chromatin remodeling. These miRNA-induced changes can lead to increased cell survival, invasiveness, proliferation, and differentiation, as well as allow for viral latency. While many recent studies have successfully implicated miRNAs in the life cycle and pathogenesis of HTLV-1 infections, there are still significant outstanding questions to be addressed.

In this study, we showed that OSW-1 effectively killed leukemia cells at subnanomolar concentrations through a unique mechanism by causing a time-dependent elevation of cytosolic Ca(2+) prior to induction of apoptosis. A mechanistic study revealed that this compound inhibited the sodium-calcium exchanger 1 on the plasma membrane, leading to an increase in cytosolic Ca(2+) and a decrease in cytosolic Na(+). The elevated cytosolic Ca(2+) caused mitochondrial calcium overload and resulted in a loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, release of cytochrome c, and activation of caspase-3. Furthermore, OSW-1 also caused a Ca(2+)-dependent cleavage of the survival factor GRP78. Inhibition of Ca(2+) entry into the mitochondria by the uniporter inhibitor RU360 or by cyclosporin A significantly prevented the OSW-1-induced cell death, indicating the important role of mitochondria in mediating the cytotoxic activity.

Multivariate analysis showed adverse OS and RFS for patients transplanted >CP1 (hazard ratio (HR) = 6.61 and 4.62) and those who had grade III-IV aGvHD (HR = 2.45 and 1.82). Patients with advanced CML had estimated OS of 65 and 47 %; and RFS of 41 and 32 % at 1 and 2 years respectively.

METHODS: This was a descriptive study of the disease burden for determining DALYs caused by cancer in Santander. The unit of analysis consisted of the Autonomous University of Bucaramanga- Population-Based Cancer Centre records and National Bureau of Statistics- mortality records for 2005. RESULTS: The global burden of disease for Santander was estimated at 877 DALY per hundred thousand people, 50 being due to disability and 827 to premature death. It was seen that premature death DALY (94 %) greatly outweighed disability DALY (6 %). The highest DALY values due to premature death in men were related to cancer of the stomach (169.8), leukaemia (106.8), colon and the rectum (100.4), lymphomas and multiple myelomas (89.9), whilst the highest values in women were observed in cervical (122.4), breast (121.9) and stomach cancer (94.2) and leukaemia (86.0). The types and cancer sites related to more years of life lost (YLL) were the colon and rectum (11.3), breast (6.2), liver (6.05) and cervical cancer (5.43).

In our previous work, we successfully produced the single-chain fragment of a variable antibody against CD25, the Dmab(scFv) antibody, using Pichia pastoris. Here, we describe a novel form of an antibody against CD25, the Dmab(scFv)-Fc antibody, also produced by P. pastoris. To construct the Dmab(scFv)-Fc antibody, the Dmab(scFv) antibody was genetically fused to the Fc fragment of a human IgG1 antibody. A fusion gene encoding Dmab(scFv)-Fc antibody was cloned into the pPIC9K plasmid and expressed at high levels, 60-70 mg/l, by P. pastoris under optimized conditions. The Dmab(scFv)-Fc antibody was similar to the Dmab(scFv) antibody in its binding specificity but different in its molecular form and Fc-mediated effector functions. The Dmab(scFv)-Fc antibody and the Dmab(scFv) antibody both bound to CD25-positive MJ cells but not to CD25-negative K562 cells. The Dmab(scFv)-Fc antibody existed as a dimer whereas the Dmab(scFv) antibody was a monomer because it lacks the Fc fragment. The Dmab(scFv)-Fc antibody enhanced the antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity of CD25-positive cancer cells, whereas the Dmab(scFv) antibody was inactive in the antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity assays. In addition, compared to the Dmab(scFv) antibody, the Dmab(scFv)-Fc antibody showed stronger immunosuppressive activity in the Con A-stimulated lymphocyte proliferation system and in the mixed lymphocyte reaction system. These results demonstrate that the Dmab(scFv)-Fc antibody produced in P. pastoris is functional, and therefore it might be developed as a novel diagnostic and therapeutic tool for ATLL and other immune disorders.",,"['Wan, Lin', 'Zhu, Shengyun', 'Zhu, Jian', 'Yang, Hao', 'Li, Shengfu', 'Li, Youping', 'Cheng, Jingqiu', 'Lu, Xiaofeng']","['Wan L', 'Zhu S', 'Zhu J', 'Yang H', 'Li S', 'Li Y', 'Cheng J', 'Lu X']","[""Key Laboratory of Transplant Engineering and Immunology, Ministry of Health, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610041, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121219,Germany,Appl Microbiol Biotechnol,Applied microbiology and biotechnology,8406612,"['0 (Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Single-Chain Antibodies)']",IM,,"['Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatography, Gel', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit/*immunology', 'Pichia/genetics/*metabolism', 'Single-Chain Antibodies/*biosynthesis/genetics/immunology/metabolism']",,,2012/12/20 06:00,2013/10/22 06:00,['2012/12/20 06:00'],"['2012/09/21 00:00 [received]', '2012/12/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/11/29 00:00 [revised]', '2012/12/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/12/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00253-012-4632-9 [doi]'],ppublish,Appl Microbiol Biotechnol. 2013 May;97(9):3855-63. doi: 10.1007/s00253-012-4632-9.

Using an advanced RNAi screen-approach in an AML mouse model we have recently identified the epigenetic 'reader' BRD4 as a promising target in AML. In the current study, we asked whether inhibition of BRD4 by a small-molecule inhibitor, JQ1, leads to growth-inhibition and apoptosis in primary human AML stem- and progenitor cells. Primary cell samples were obtained from 37 patients with freshly diagnosed AML (n=23) or refractory AML (n=14). BRD4 was found to be expressed at the mRNA and protein level in unfractionated AML cells as well as in highly enriched CD34(+)/CD38(-) and CD34(+)/CD38(+) stem- and progenitor cells in all patients examined. In unfractionated leukemic cells, submicromolar concentrations of JQ1 induced major growth-inhibitory effects (IC(5)(0) 0.05-0.5 microM) in most samples, including cells derived from relapsed or refractory patients. In addition, JQ1 was found to induce apoptosis in CD34+/CD38(-) and CD34(+)/CD38(+) stem- and progenitor cells in all donors examined as evidenced by combined surface/Annexin-V staining. Moreover, we were able to show that JQ1 synergizes with ARA-C in inducing growth inhibition in AML cells.

Neutralizing antibodies are mainly directed against the envelope proteins, which consist of two molecules, the surface envelope (SU) protein and the transmembrane envelope (TM) protein. Antibodies broadly neutralizing the human immunodeficiencvy virus-1 (HIV-1) and binding to the TM protein gp41 of the virus have been isolated from infected individuals. Their epitopes are located in the membrane proximal external region (MPER). Since there are difficulties to induce such neutralizing antibodies as basis for an effective AIDS vaccine, we performed a comparative analysis immunising with the TM proteins of different viruses from the family Retroviridae. Both subfamilies, the Orthoretrovirinae and the Spumaretrovirinae were included. In this study, the TM proteins of three gammaretroviruses including (1) the porcine endogenous retrovirus (PERV), (2) the Koala retrovirus (KoRV), (3) the feline leukemia virus (FeLV), of two lentiviruses, HIV-1, HIV-2, and of two spumaviruses, the feline foamy virus (FFV) and the primate foamy virus (PFV) were used for immunisation. Whereas in all immunisation studies binding antibodies were induced, neutralizing antibodies were only found in the case of the gammaretroviruses. The induced antibodies were directed against the MPER and the fusion peptide proximal region (FPPR) of their TM proteins; however only the antibodies against the MPER were neutralizing. Most importantly, the epitopes in the MPER were localized in the same position as the epitopes of the antibodies broadly neutralizing HIV-1 in the TM protein gp41 of HIV-1, indicating that the MPER is an effective target for the neutralization of retroviruses.",,"['Denner, Joachim']",['Denner J'],"['Robert Koch Institute; Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20121218,United States,Hum Vaccin Immunother,Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics,101572652,"['0 (Antibodies, Neutralizing)', '0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (Viral Vaccines)']",IM,,"['Antibodies, Neutralizing/*blood', 'Antibodies, Viral/*blood', 'Epitope Mapping', 'Gammaretrovirus/*immunology', 'Lentivirus/*immunology', 'Spumavirus/*immunology', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/administration & dosage/*immunology', 'Viral Vaccines/administration & dosage/*immunology']",PMC3891701,,2012/12/20 06:00,2015/01/16 06:00,['2012/12/20 06:00'],"['2012/12/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/12/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/16 06:00 [medline]']","['23221 [pii]', '10.4161/hv.23221 [doi]']",ppublish,Hum Vaccin Immunother. 2013 Mar;9(3):462-70. doi: 10.4161/hv.23221.

However, how MLL4-deposited H3K4me3 interplays with other histone marks in epigenetic processes remains largely unknown. Here, we show that MLL4 plays an essential role in differentiating NT2/D1 stem cells by activating differentiation-specific genes. A tandem plant homeodomain (PHD(4-6)) of MLL4 recognizes unmethylated or asymmetrically dimethylated histone H4 Arg 3 (H4R3me0 or H4R3me2a) and is required for MLL4's nucleosomal methyltransferase activity and MLL4-mediated differentiation. Kabuki syndrome mutations in PHD(4-6) reduce PHD(4-6)'s binding ability and MLL4's catalytic activity. PHD(4-6)'s binding strength is inhibited by H4R3 symmetric dimethylation (H4R3me2s), a gene-repressive mark. The protein arginine methyltransferase 7 (PRMT7), but not PRMT5, represses MLL4 target genes by up-regulating H4R3me2s levels and antagonizes MLL4-mediated differentiation. Consistently, PRMT7 knockdown increases MLL4-catalyzed H3K4me3 levels. During differentiation, decreased H4R3me2s levels are associated with increased H3K4me3 levels at a cohort of genes, including many HOXA and HOXB genes. These findings indicate that the trans-tail inhibition of MLL4-generated H3K4me3 by PRMT7-regulated H4R3me2s may result from H4R3me2s's interference with PHD(4-6)'s binding activity and is a novel epigenetic mechanism that underlies opposing effects of MLL4 and PRMT7 on cellular differentiation.",,"['Dhar, Shilpa S', 'Lee, Sung-Hun', 'Kan, Pu-Yeh', 'Voigt, Philipp', 'Ma, Li', 'Shi, Xiaobing', 'Reinberg, Danny', 'Lee, Min Gyu']","['Dhar SS', 'Lee SH', 'Kan PY', 'Voigt P', 'Ma L', 'Shi X', 'Reinberg D', 'Lee MG']","['Department of Molecular and Cellular Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HHMI/Howard Hughes Medical Institute/United States', 'R01 CA157919/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM064844/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM064844/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM095659/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R37GM037120/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA166672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5 P30 CA0166672 35/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 GM037120/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Genes Dev,Genes & development,8711660,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Intermediate Filament Proteins)', '0 (NES protein, human)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Nestin)', '157907-48-7 (HoxA protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.319 (PRMT7 protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.319 (Protein-Arginine N-Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (MLL4 protein, human)']",IM,,"['Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Histones/*metabolism', 'Homeodomain Proteins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Intermediate Filament Proteins/metabolism', 'Methylation', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/metabolism', 'Nestin', 'Neurons/cytology', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Protein-Arginine N-Methyltransferases/genetics', 'Stem Cells/cytology']",PMC3533079,,2012/12/20 06:00,2013/02/08 06:00,['2012/12/20 06:00'],"['2012/12/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/12/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/08 06:00 [medline]']","['26/24/2749 [pii]', '10.1101/gad.203356.112 [doi]']",ppublish,Genes Dev. 2012 Dec 15;26(24):2749-62. doi: 10.1101/gad.203356.112.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The mechanisms underlying switches from CSCs to non-CSCs in vivo remain to be understood. We address this issue in AML from the aspect of epigenetics using genome-wide screening for DNA methylation and selected histone modifications. We found no major differences in DNA methylation, especially in promoter CpG islands, between CSCs and non-CSCs. By contrast, we found thousands of genes that change H3K4me3 and/or H3K27me3 status between stem and progenitor cells as well as between progenitor and mature cells. Stem cell related pathways and proliferation or metabolism related pathways characterize genes differentially enriched for H3K4me3/H3K27me3 in stem and progenitor populations. Bivalent genes in stem cells are more plastic during differentiation and are more likely to lose H3K4me3 than to lose H3K27me3, consistent with increasingly closed chromatin state with differentiation.

METHODS: We present the pathologic features, risk factors and outcomes of eight cases of PVN in native kidneys. RESULTS: The cohort included eight males aged 16-73 years (mean 47.4) with an immunocompromised state (mean duration 3.15 years) attributable to: hematologic malignancies (n = 6), for which three had undergone bone marrow transplant; lung transplant (n = 1) and combined tuberculosis and diabetes (n = 1). Seven patients were receiving specific immunosuppressive therapies. Patients were biopsied for acute kidney injury (AKI) with rise in mean creatinine levels from baseline 1.6 to 2.8 mg/dL. Pathology showed BK PVN with characteristic intranuclear inclusions staining positive for SV40 T antigen and negative for JC virus (JCV), with positive serum and/or urine PCR for BK virus. One patient had focal medullary JCV co-infection. Two patients also had renal infiltration by chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Six patients received specific therapy directed to PVN (cidofovir or leflunomide). Follow-up ranged from 2 to 20 (mean 10) months. Despite marked decrease in serum BK viral copy numbers, creatinine continued to rise in six cases (mean 3.7 mg/dL in four, requiring dialysis in two) and three patients died of malignancy, opportunistic infection or renal failure. Advanced histologic stage of PVN, ineffective antiviral therapy, co-morbidities and persistent immunocompromised state likely contributed to the poor outcomes.

Here we compared gene transfer efficiency in the liver after in vivo injection of recombinant lentiviral or Moloney murine leukemia viral (MoMuLV) vectors in hepatectomized rats treated or not with retrorsine, an alkaloid that blocks hepatocyte division and induces megalocytosis. Partial hepatectomy alone resulted in a similar increase in hepatocyte transduction using either vector. In retrorsine-treated and partially hepatectomized rats, transduction with MoMuLV vectors dropped dramatically. In contrast, we observed that retrorsine treatment combined with partial hepatectomy increased lentiviral transduction to higher levels than hepatectomy alone.

We also evaluated the anti-apoptotic effect of patient-derived MSCs on leukemic cells and studied their cytogenetic characteristics in comparison to BM hematopoietic cells. B-CLL-derived BM MSCs exhibit a similar phenotype, differentiation potential, and ability to suppress T-cell proliferative responses as compared with MSCs from normal controls. Furthermore, they do not carry the cytogenetic abnormalities of the leukemic clone, and they exert a similar anti-apoptotic effect on leukemic cells and healthy donor-derived B-cells, as their normal counterparts. On the other hand, MSCs from B-CLL patients significantly promote normal B-cell proliferation and IgG production, in contrast to healthy-donor-derived MSCs. Furthermore, they have impaired reserves, defective cellular growth due to increased apoptotic cell death and exhibit aberrant production of stromal cell-derived factor 1, B-cell activating factor, a proliferation inducing ligand, and transforming growth factor beta1, cytokines that are crucial for the survival/nourishing of the leukemic cells.

CASE REPORT: An 80-year-old Japanese male was diagnosed with acquired hemophilia A. He had compartment-like symptoms due to soft tissue hemorrhage in his left forearm and right lower extremity. A blood examination showed neutrophilia with a white blood cell count of 31,900/muL (91.9% neutrophils), an activated partial thromboplastin time of 69.0 seconds, coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) < 1.0%, and anti-FVIII inhibitor, 190 BU/mL. The bleeding episodes were controlled with intravenous activated prothrombin complex concentrate (FEIBA((R))) followed by recombinant factor VIIa (NovoSeven((R))). In addition, oral prednisolone (maximum dose, 30 mg/day) plus four doses of rituximab effectively suppressed anti-FVIII inhibitor levels while simultaneously reducing the neutrophil count. CNL with the JAK2 kinase V617F mutation was identified as the underlying disease.

This study aimed to identify factors influencing the long-term outcome in these patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study included 727 older patients with AML (median age, 67 years) treated in two idarubicin (IDA) versus daunorubicin (DNR) Acute Leukemia French Association trials. Prognostic analysis was based on standard univariate and multivariate models and also included a cure fraction model to focus on long-term outcome. RESULTS: Age, WBC count, secondary AML, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS), and adverse-risk and favorable-risk AML subsets (European LeukemiaNet classification) all influenced complete remission (CR) rate and overall survival (OS). IDA random assignment was associated with higher CR rate, but not with longer OS (P = .13). The overall cure rate was 13.3%. Older age and ECOG-PS more than 1 negatively influenced cure rate, which was higher in patients with favorable-risk AML (39.1% v 8.0% in adverse-risk AML; P < .001) and those treated with IDA (16.6% v 9.8% with DNR; P = .018). The long-term impact of IDA was still observed in patients younger than age 65 years, although all of the younger patients in the DNR control arm received high DNR doses (cure rate, 27.4% for IDA v 15.9% for DNR; P = .049). In multivariate analysis, IDA random assignment remained associated with a higher cure rate (P = .04), together with younger age and favorable-risk AML, despite not influencing OS (P = .11).

It is not defined whether exhaustion contributes to T-cell dysfunction observed in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). We investigated the phenotype and function of T cells from CLL patients and age-matched controls. CD8+ and CD4+ T cells from CLL patients had increased expression of exhaustion markers CD244, CD160, and PD1, with expansion of a PD1+BLIMP1HI subset. These molecules were most highly expressed in the expanded population of effector T cells in CLL. CLL CD8+ T cells showed functional defects in proliferation and cytotoxicity, with the cytolytic defect caused by impaired granzyme packaging into vesicles and nonpolarized degranulation. In contrast to virally induced exhaustion, CLL T cells showed increased production of interferon-gamma and TNFalpha and increased expression of TBET, and normal IL2 production. These defects were not restricted to expanded populations of cytomegalovirus (CMV)-specific cells, although CMV seropositivity modulated the distribution of lymphocyte subsets, the functional defects were present irrespective of CMV serostatus. Therefore, although CLL CD8+ T cells exhibit features of T-cell exhaustion, they retain the ability to produce cytokines.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed NIH-defined GVHD in 147 acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients. RESULTS: The cumulative incidence of classic acute GVHD (aGVHD), late aGVHD and chronic GVHD (cGVHD) was 63%, 12% and 41%, respectively. cGVHD was subclassified as classic versus overlap syndrome in 40% versus 60% of cases. In multivariate Cox regression analysis with GVHD as time-dependent covariate, classic aGVHD grade III/IV had a negative impact on overall survival (OS) due to higher non-relapse mortality. cGVHD of any grade was associated with superior OS, which was due to lower relapse incidence. Classic cGVHD versus overlap syndrome had no differential impact. In 44 patients without GVHD after transplant who received donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI), the cumulative incidence of classic aGVHD, late aGVHD or cGVHD was 60%, 5% and 57%. Occurrence of cGVHD after DLI was associated with improved OS due to lower relapse incidence. CONCLUSIONS: The NIH consensus criteria for GVHD clearly define prognostic subgroups in patients transplanted for ALL. The improved OS in patients developing cGVHD after transplant or DLI gives clear evidence for a potent graft-versus-leukemia effect in this indication.",,"['Terwey, T H', 'Le Duc, T M', 'Hemmati, P G', 'le Coutre, P', 'Nagy, M', 'Martus, P', 'Dorken, B', 'Arnold, R']","['Terwey TH', 'Le Duc TM', 'Hemmati PG', 'le Coutre P', 'Nagy M', 'Martus P', 'Dorken B', 'Arnold R']","['Department of Hematology, Oncology and Tumor Immunology, Charite - University Medicine Berlin, Campus Virchow-Klinikum,Augustenburger Platz 1, 13353 Berlin, Germany. theis.terwey@charite.de']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20121217,England,Ann Oncol,Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,9007735,,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', '*Graft vs Host Disease', '*Graft vs Leukemia Effect', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Transplants', 'Young Adult']",,,2012/12/19 06:00,2013/12/20 06:00,['2012/12/19 06:00'],"['2012/12/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/12/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/20 06:00 [medline]']","['S0923-7534(19)37236-9 [pii]', '10.1093/annonc/mds615 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Oncol. 2013 May;24(5):1363-70. doi: 10.1093/annonc/mds615.

Herein, we used a large cohort study to examine this association. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty-five thousand three hundred twenty-two volunteers aged 50-76 years were recruited from 2000 to 2002. Incident hematologic malignancies (n = 666) were identified through 2009 by linkage to the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results cancer registry. Hazard ratios (HRs) for hematologic malignancies associated with PA averaged over 10 years before baseline were estimated with Cox proportional hazards models, adjusting for factors associated with hematologic cancers or PA. RESULTS: There was a decreased risk of hematologic malignancies associated with PA (HR = 0.66 [95% confidence interval, 95% CI 0.51-0.86] for the highest tertile of all PA, P-trend = 0.005, and HR = 0.60 [95% CI 0.44-0.82] for the highest tertile of moderate/high-intensity PA, P-trend = 0.002). These associations were strongest for myeloid neoplasms (HR = 0.48 [95% CI 0.29-0.79] for the highest tertile of all PA, P-trend = 0.013, and HR = 0.40 [95% CI 0.21-0.77] for the highest tertile of moderate/high-intensity PA, P-trend = 0.016). There were also significant associations between PA and chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma or other mature B-cell lymphomas except plasma cell disorders. CONCLUSIONS: Our study offers the strongest epidemiological evidence, to date, to suggest an association between regular PA and dose-dependent risk reduction for most hematologic malignancies, particularly myeloid neoplasms.",,"['Walter, R B', 'Buckley, S A', 'White, E']","['Walter RB', 'Buckley SA', 'White E']","['Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA 98109-1024, USA. rwalter@fhcrc.org']",['eng'],"['K05 CA154337/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K05-CA154337/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30-CA15704-35S6/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121217,England,Ann Oncol,Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,9007735,,IM,,"['Aged', 'Cohort Studies', 'Exercise/*physiology', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Life Style', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prospective Studies', 'Recreation', 'Risk Factors', '*Risk Reduction Behavior', 'SEER Program', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",PMC3629898,,2012/12/19 06:00,2013/12/20 06:00,['2012/12/19 06:00'],"['2012/12/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/12/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/20 06:00 [medline]']","['S0923-7534(19)37251-5 [pii]', '10.1093/annonc/mds631 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Oncol. 2013 May;24(5):1370-7. doi: 10.1093/annonc/mds631.

In our Australian case-control studies of these cancers, we investigated whether parental alcohol consumption before or during pregnancy was associated with risk. METHODS: Cases were identified through the ten Australian pediatric oncology centers, and controls were recruited through national random-digit dialling. Detailed information on alcohol consumption, including beverage type, amount, and timing, was collected from 690 case families (388 ALL and 302 CBT) and 1,396 control families. Data were analyzed using unconditional logistic regression. RESULTS: We found no evidence that maternal alcohol use before or during pregnancy was associated with an increased risk of either cancer; rather, there was evidence of inverse associations, particularly with wine. For both cancers, we observed U-shaped associations with paternal alcohol consumption in the year before the pregnancy, possibly driven by reduced risk at moderate levels of beer and wine intake and increased risk associated with high levels of beer intake. Moderate intake of spirits by fathers was associated with an increased risk of CBT but not ALL. These findings would be strengthened by corroboration in other studies. While the inverse associations with wine may be interesting mechanistically, the public health message remains that maternal alcohol use during pregnancy causes serious disorders in the offspring and should be avoided.

DESIGN: Inception cohort. SETTING: National database. PATIENTS: Individuals with CLL and UADT cancers included in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incidence was compared by computing standardized incidence ratio (SIR), the ratio of observed UADT cancers in patients with CLL, and the number of UADT cancers expected based on the characteristics of patients with CLL and population incidence of UADT cancers. The association between CLL and UADT cancer stage was measured using odds ratio (OR) calculations. Survival of patients with UADT cancer with and without CLL was compared. RESULTS: For the SIR calculation, 36 985 patients with CLL contributed a mean 6.36 years of follow-up each, for a total of 235 314 person-years of follow-up. The SIR was 1.18 (95% CI, 0.97-1.41) for UADT cancers; 1.52 (95% CI, 1.18-1.93) for laryngeal cancer; and 1.92 (95% CI, 1.05-3.23) for cancers of the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses. In the stage and survival analyses, 253 patients with CLL followed by a UADT cancer were compared with 133 840 patients with 1 UADT cancer only. Cancers of the UADT in patients with CLL were more likely localized (OR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.37-0.68). Relative survival was worse in patients with CLL. In multivariate analysis, CLL was independently associated with poorer observed survival (hazard ratio, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.24-1.70). CONCLUSIONS: Larynx and nasal cavity cancers were more common in patients with CLL. Overall incidence of UADT cancers was not significantly elevated.

We have recently reported that nur77(-/-)nor1(-/-) mice rapidly develop acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and that Nur77 and Nor1 transcripts were universally downregulated in human AML blasts. These findings indicate that Nur77 and Nor1 function as leukemia suppressors. We further demonstrated silencing of Nur77 and Nor1 in leukemia stem cells (LSCs). We here report that inhibition of histone deacetylase (HDAC) using the specific class I HDAC inhibitor SNDX-275 restored the expression of Nur77/Nor1 and induced expression of activator protein 1 transcription factors c-Jun and JunB, and of death receptor TRAIL, in AML cells and in CD34(+)/38(-) AML LSCs. Importantly, SNDX-275 induced extensive apoptosis in AML cells, which could be suppressed by silencing nur77 and nor1. In addition, pro-apoptotic proteins Bim and Noxa were transcriptionally upregulated by SNDX-275 in AML cells and in LSCs. Our present work is the first report of a novel mechanism of HDAC inhibitor-induced apoptosis in AML that involves restoration of the silenced nuclear receptors Nur77 and Nor1, activation of activator protein 1 transcription factors, a death receptor and pro-apoptotic proteins.",,"['Zhou, L', 'Ruvolo, V R', 'McQueen, T', 'Chen, W', 'Samudio, I J', 'Conneely, O', 'Konopleva, M', 'Andreeff, M']","['Zhou L', 'Ruvolo VR', 'McQueen T', 'Chen W', 'Samudio IJ', 'Conneely O', 'Konopleva M', 'Andreeff M']","['Section of Molecular Hematology and Therapy, Department of Leukemia, University of Texas M.

Correlation approaches, such as a hierarchical cluster analysis, have been widely used to analyze omics data. In addition to the changes in the mean levels of molecules in the omics data, it is important to know about the changes in the correlation relationship among molecules between 2 experimental conditions. The development of a tool to identify differential correlation patterns in omics data in an efficient and unbiased manner is therefore desirable. We developed the DiffCorr package, a simple method for identifying pattern changes between 2 experimental conditions in correlation networks, which builds on a commonly used association measure, such as Pearson's correlation coefficient. DiffCorr calculates correlation matrices for each dataset, identifies the first principal component-based ""eigen-molecules"" in the correlation networks, and tests differential correlation between the 2 groups based on Fisher's z-test. We illustrated its utility by demonstrating biologically relevant, differentially correlated molecules in transcriptome coexpression and metabolite-to-metabolite correlation networks. DiffCorr can explore differential correlations between 2 conditions in the context of post-genomics data types, namely transcriptomics and metabolomics. DiffCorr is simple to use in calculating differential correlations and is suitable for the first step towards inferring causal relationships and detecting biomarker candidates.

Transcription factors have the capacity to regulate global transcriptional profiles, and are consequently often found to be deregulated in their expression and function during tumorigenesis. Sex-determining region Y-related high-mobility-group box transcription factor 4 (SOX4) is a member of the group C subfamily of the SOX transcription factors and has a critical role during embryogenesis, where its expression is widespread and controls the development of numerous tissues. SOX4 expression is elevated in a wide variety of tumors, including leukemia, colorectal cancer, lung cancer and breast cancer, suggesting a fundamental role in the development of these malignancies. In many cancers, deregulated expression of this developmental factor has been correlated with increased cancer cell proliferation, cell survival, inhibition of apoptosis and tumor progression through the induction of an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and metastasis. However, in a limited subset of tumors, SOX4 has also been reported to act as a tumor suppressor. These opposing roles suggest that the outcome of SOX4 activation depends on the cellular context and the tumor origin. Indeed, SOX4 expression, transcriptional activity and target gene specificity can be controlled by signaling pathways, including the transforming growth factor-beta and the WNT pathway, as well as at the post-translational level through regulation of protein stability and interaction with specific cofactors, such as TCF, syntenin-1 and p53.

However, whether the increase is associated with risk factors or poor survival is unknown. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of liver transplant recipients who were followed up during 1999-2009 and had IISAlp 1 month after liver transplantation, which was sustained for at least 6 months. Clinical parameters, survival, and risk factors were analyzed and compared between recipients who survived longer than 6 months after transplantation. RESULTS: Among 307 liver transplant recipients, 44 had IISAlp. Compared with the control group, the patients with IISAlp were more frequently of the pediatric population, recipients of female donor or living-related partial liver grafts, and found to have biliary-related pretransplant disorders, lower body weight, and shorter warm ischemic time (P < 0.01). One patient with IISAlp died of acute myeloid leukemia during the follow-up period. The mean time to observation of IISAlp after liver transplantation was 6.3 +/- 0.8 months. The mean follow-up duration was 5.5 +/- 0.2 years. Stepwise multivariate analysis showed that being a pediatric or living-related liver transplant recipient was an independent risk factor for IISAlp, with adjusted hazard ratios (95% confidence interval) of 5.41 (2.59-11.28) and 3.0 (0.98-9.27), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Therefore, being a pediatric or living-related liver transplant recipient was an independent risk factor for IISAlp. However, IISAlp was not associated with poor survival after liver transplantation. Hence, patients who have undergone liver transplantation do not require frequent routine examination of serum alkaline phosphatase levels.","['Copyright (c) 2012 Surgical Associates Ltd.

MK was found in 62 of 549 cases (11.3%), with all but one assigned to the unfavorable cytogenetic risk category; 57 of these 62 MK cases had a complex karyotype. Comparison with a subgroup of AML cases, who had unfavorable karyotypic profiles yet without MK (non-MK) and who were treated uniformly with similar, ""3+7""-based regimens, revealed significant (P < 0.05) associations between MK and advanced age, low white blood cell count at diagnosis, and inferior overall survival (6.5 vs. 15 months for non-MK cases).

However, recent findings suggest that some nucleoporins (Nups), including Nup98, have additional functions in developmental gene regulation. Nup98, which exhibits transcription-dependent mobility at the NPC but can also bind chromatin away from the nuclear envelope, is frequently involved in chromosomal translocations in a subset of patients suffering from acute myeloid leukemia (AML). A common paradigm suggests that Nup98 translocations cause aberrant transcription when they are recuited to aberrant genomic loci. Importantly, this model fails to account for the potential loss of wild type (WT) Nup98 function in the presence of Nup98 translocation mutants. Here we examine how the cell might regulate Nup98 nucleoplasmic protein levels to control transcription in healthy cells. In addition, we discuss the possibility that dominant negative Nup98 fusion proteins disrupt the transcriptional activity of WT Nup98 in the nucleoplasm to drive AML.",['Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

However, its roles in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are predominantly unknown. Here we describe the role of Grb10 in FLT3-ITD-mediated AML. We observed that Grb10 physically associates with FLT3 in response to FLT3-ligand (FL) stimulation through FLT3 phospho-tyrosine 572 and 793 residues and constitutively associates with oncogenic FLT3-ITD. Furthermore endogenous Grb10-FLT3 association was observed in OCI-AML-5 cells. Grb10 expression did not alter FLT3 receptor activation or stability in Ba/F3-FLT3 cells. However, expression of Grb10 enhanced FL-induced Akt phosphorylation without affecting Erk or p38 phosphorylation in Ba/F3-FLT3-WT and Ba/F3-FLT3-ITD. Selective Grb10 depletion reduced Akt phosphorylation in Ba/F3-FLT3-WT and OCI-AML-5 cells. Grb10 transduces signal from FLT3 by direct interaction with p85 and Ba/F3-FLT3-ITD cells expressing Grb10 exhibits higher STAT5 activation. Grb10 regulates the cell cycle by increasing cell population in S-phase. Expression of Grb10 furthermore resulted in an increased proliferation and survival of Ba/F3-FLT3-ITD cells as well as increased colony formation in semisolid culture. Grb10 expression was significantly increased in AML patients compared to healthy controls and was also elevated in patients carrying FLT3-ITD mutants. The elevated Grb10 expression partially correlated to relapse as well as to poor prognosis. These results suggest that Grb10 binds to both normal and oncogenic FLT3 and induces PI3K-Akt and STAT5 signaling pathways resulting in an enhanced proliferation, survival and colony formation of hematopoietic cells.","['Copyright (c) 2012 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.

Here we report the final, 10-year follow-up analysis of disease-free survival, overall survival, and long-term safety. METHODS: BCIRG 001 was an open label, phase 3, multicentre trial in which 1491 patients aged 18-70 years with node-positive, early breast cancer and a Karnofsky score of 80% or more were randomly assigned to adjuvant treatment with docetaxel, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide (TAC) or fluorouracil, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide (FAC) every 3 weeks for six cycles. Randomisation was stratified according to institution and number of involved axillary lymph nodes per patient (one to three vs four or more). Disease-free survival was the primary endpoint and was defined as the interval between randomisation and breast cancer relapse, second primary cancer, or death, whichever occurred first. Efficacy analyses were based on the intention-to-treat principle. BCIRG 001 is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00688740. FINDINGS: Enrolement took place between June 11, 1997 and June 3, 1999; 745 patients were assigned to receive TAC and 746 patients were assigned to receive FAC. After a median follow-up of 124 months (IQR 90-126), disease-free survival was 62% (95% CI 58-65) for patients in the TAC group and 55% (51-59) for patients in the FAC group (hazard ratio [HR] 0.80, 95% CI 0.68-0.93; log-rank p=0.0043). 10-year overall survival was 76% (95% CI 72-79) for patients in the TAC group and 69% (65-72) for patients in the FAC group (HR 0.74, 0.61-0.90; log-rank p=0.0020). TAC improved disease-free survival relative to FAC irrespective of nodal, hormone receptor, and HER2 status, although not all differences were significant in these subgroup analyses. Grade 3-4 heart failure occurred in 26 (3%) patients in the TAC group and 17 (2%) patients in the FAC group, and caused death in two patients in the TAC group and four patients in the FAC group. A substantial decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction (defined as a relative decrease from baseline of 20% or more) was seen in 58 (17%) patients who received TAC and 41 (15%) patients who received FAC. Six patients who received TAC developed leukaemia or myelodysplasia, as did three patients who received FAC. INTERPRETATION: Our results provide evidence that the initial therapeutic outcomes seen at the 5-year follow-up with a docetaxel-containing adjuvant regimen are maintained at 10 years. However, a substantial percentage of patients had a decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction, probably caused by anthracycline therapy, which warrants further investigation.

In rodents, NBPs cause necrosis at injection sites. Bisphosphonates accumulate within bones, especially where there is inflammation. We hypothesized that if jawbone-accumulated NBPs are released, they may directly injure cells around the jawbones. To examine this hypothesis, we compared the direct effects of zoledronate (NBP) and/or etidronate (non-NBP) on various cells, including periodontal cells. DESIGN: Various human tumour cells (such as squamous carcinoma cells and prostate adenocarcinoma cells) and periodontal cells (such as gingival fibroblasts and periodontal ligament cells) were incubated with or without zoledronate and/or etidronate. Cell viability and cytotoxicity were determined by tetrazolium dye assay and by FITC-Annexin V/propidium iodide assay, respectively. RESULTS: Zoledronate, at 100muM, was toxic to all types of cells tested, while its toxicity varied among cells at both 1 and 10muM. There was no clear difference between tumour cells and non-tumour cells in sensitivity to the cytotoxicity of zoledronate. In contrast, etidronate was not toxic at 1-100muM in any of the cells tested. Interestingly, etidronate reduced the cytotoxicity of zoledronate in many cell-types, including gingival fibroblasts. CONCLUSIONS: These results, together with those reported by others and those from our previous in vivo experiments, suggest that NBPs, upon release from jawbones (e.g., during dental surgery or bone infection), may directly injure various cells located around the jawbones, and that etidronate may be protective against the cytotoxicity of NBPs in periodontal tissues.",['Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The anti-tumour activity of the compound has been associated with its capacity to induce DNA double stranded breaks. Target profiling by affinity chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry led to the identification of histone H2A.Z as a protein capable of binding ST1926 specifically. The result was confirmed by studies involving Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR). This indicates that H2A.Z is a primary target of ST1926 and links the perturbations of the histone pathway observed by microarray analysis to the DNA damage and apoptotic responses caused by the atypical retinoid. Comparison of the whole-genome gene-expression profiles of the ST1926-sensitive NB4 and the ST1926-resistant NB4.437r cell lines demonstrated differential expression of numerous genes. Network analysis of the data indicated enrichment of the cellular pathways controlling cAMP (cyclic adenosine-monophosphate)-dependent signal transduction, proteasome-dependent protein degradation and nuclear histones in NB4.437r cells. Pharmacological inhibition of cAMP-dependent protein kinase A with H89 partially reverted resistance of NB4.437r cells to ST1926. Conversely, inhibition of the proteasome with MG132 or bortezomib blocked the apoptotic response afforded by ST1926 in the NB4 cell line. This last effect was associated with a dramatic reduction in the DNA damage caused by the atypical retinoid. The results corroborate the idea that DNA damage is an important determinant of ST1926 apoptotic activity. More importantly, they demonstrate a proactive role of the proteasome in the DNA damaging and ensuing apoptotic response observed upon the challenge of acute myeloid leukaemia cells with ST1926.",['Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

We show that S. Typhimurium inhibit T cell responses by producing L-Asparaginase II, which catalyzes the hydrolysis of L-asparagine to aspartic acid and ammonia. L-Asparaginase II is necessary and sufficient to suppress T cell blastogenesis, cytokine production, and proliferation and to downmodulate expression of the T cell receptor. Furthermore, S. Typhimurium-induced inhibition of T cells in vitro is prevented upon addition of L-asparagine. S. Typhimurium lacking the L-Asparaginase II gene (STM3106) are unable to inhibit T cell responses and exhibit attenuated virulence in vivo.

METHODS: The study consisted of two phases: scale construction and scale validation. For the item-generation phase, a summary of the literature combined with qualitative results from item-generation interviews with 29 acute or chronic leukemia patients and 16 health care providers yielded an initial item pool reflecting leukemia-specific concerns and symptoms. Items underwent iterations of review and reduction according to defined retention criteria to support content validity, as defined by priority concerns of patients. Seventeen final leukemia-specific items were combined with the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General to create the FACT-Leukemia (FACT-Leu) scale. For the validation phase, 79 individuals with acute or chronic leukemia completed questionnaires at three time points. RESULTS: All FACT-Leu subscale and aggregated scores showed high internal consistency (alphas ranging from 0.75 to 0.96). Test-retest reliability was adequate for all subscales (intraclass correlation range 0.765-0.890). The FACT-Leu scale demonstrated good convergent validity, with significant correlations with quality-of-life criteria and performance status, in the expected direction. FACT-Leu subscale scores were significantly different among the three performance status change groups, suggesting good responsiveness to change.

The establishment of genotype-phenotype associations in NF1 is potentially useful for targeted therapeutic intervention but has generally been unsuccessful, apart from small subsets of molecularly defined patients. The objective of this study was to evaluate the clinical phenotype associated with the specific types of NF1 mutation in a retrospectively recorded clinical dataset comprising 149 NF1 mutation-known individuals from unrelated families. Each patient was assessed for ten NF1-related clinical features, including the number of cafe-au-lait spots, cutaneous and subcutaneous neurofibromas and the presence/absence of intertriginous skin freckling, Lisch nodules, plexiform and spinal neurofibromas, optic gliomas, other neoplasms (in particular CNS gliomas, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs), juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia, rhabdomyosarcoma, phaechromocytoma, gastrointestinal stromal tumors, juvenile xanthogranuloma, and lipoma) and evidence of learning difficulties. Gender and age at examination were also recorded. Patients were subcategorized according to their associated NF1 germ line mutations: frame shift deletions (52), splice-site mutations (23), nonsense mutations (36), missense mutations (32) and other types of mutation (6). A significant association was apparent between possession of a splice-site mutation and the presence of brain gliomas and MPNSTs (p = 0.006). If confirmed, these findings are likely to be clinically important since up to a third of NF1 patients harbor splice-site mutations. A significant influence of gender was also observed on the number of subcutaneous neurofibromas (females, p = 0.009) and preschool learning difficulties (females, p = 0.022).",,"['Alkindy, Adila', 'Chuzhanova, Nadia', 'Kini, Usha', 'Cooper, David N', 'Upadhyaya, Meena']","['Alkindy A', 'Chuzhanova N', 'Kini U', 'Cooper DN', 'Upadhyaya M']","['Clinical Genetics Department, Sultan Qaboos University Hospital, Al-Khod, Muscat 123, Sultanate of Oman.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20120813,England,Hum Genomics,Human genomics,101202210,"['0 (Neurofibromin 1)', '0 (RNA Splice Sites)']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Cafe-au-Lait Spots/complications/genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', '*Genetic Association Studies', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Germ-Line Mutation', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation, Missense', 'Neurofibroma/complications/genetics', 'Neurofibromatosis 1/complications/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Neurofibromin 1/*genetics', 'Optic Nerve Glioma/complications/genetics', '*RNA Splice Sites', 'Risk Factors', 'Sex Factors', 'Young Adult']",PMC3528442,,2012/12/19 06:00,2013/04/26 06:00,['2012/12/19 06:00'],"['2012/07/03 00:00 [received]', '2012/08/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/12/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/12/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/26 06:00 [medline]']","['1479-7364-6-12 [pii]', '10.1186/1479-7364-6-12 [doi]']",epublish,Hum Genomics. 2012 Aug 13;6:12. doi: 10.1186/1479-7364-6-12.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Depending on inciting events and environmental conditions, cells can die by apoptosis or necrosis, although these processes differ in their immunological consequences. Whereas apoptosis is immunologically silent, necrosis leads to inflammation, possibly reflecting the array of ""danger"" molecules released. To investigate these processes, the extracellular release of HMGB1 during necrosis was characterized in vitro using Jurkat T cell leukemia cells treated to induce necrosis by freeze-thaw, heat, hydrogen peroxide or ethanol. HMGB1 is a non-histone nuclear protein that represents a prototype alarmin; the pro-inflammatory activity of HMGB1, however, depends on past-translational modifications and association with other molecules including cytokines. As results of these studies showed, the extent and kinetics of HMGB1 release from necrotic cells varies markedly depending on its induction. Among treatments tested, freeze-thaw produced the highest levels of extracellular HMGB1; levels with ethanol treatment were very low and in the range of untreated controls. Similar results were obtained with DNA, with freeze-thaw leading to significant amounts of extracellular DNA although this DNA was subject to rapid nuclease digestion. Together, these findings suggest that the rapid release of nuclear molecules is not an invariable feature of necrosis and that the characterization of the immune properties of dead and dying cells should use systems in which the content and stability of extracellular components are well defined.",,"['Beyer, Christian', 'Pisetsky, David S']","['Beyer C', 'Pisetsky DS']","['Department for Internal Medicine 3 and Institute for Clinical Immunology, Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-Nuremberg, Erlangen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['AI093,960/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20130116,England,Autoimmunity,Autoimmunity,8900070,"['0 (HMGB1 Protein)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Cell Death/genetics/*immunology', 'DNA/immunology/metabolism', 'HMGB1 Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', '*Models, Immunological', 'Necrosis/genetics/immunology', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']",,,2012/12/19 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2012/12/19 06:00'],"['2012/12/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/12/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/08916934.2012.750297 [doi]'],ppublish,Autoimmunity. 2013 Aug;46(5):298-301. doi: 10.3109/08916934.2012.750297.

Gastrointestinal involvement (GI) is extremely rare from nonspecific abdominal symptoms to obstruction.

The prognosis of patients with de novo MS cases has been reported to be better than those who have a coexisting leukemia. MS is a rare extramedullary tumor, which should be considered in the differential diagnosis of a soft tissue mass involving the duodenum, especially if there is a coexisting hematological disorder.

Often, the strategy is proposed of treating patients with relapsed leukemia into a second remission (CR2) and then proceeding to allogeneic transplantation as the definitive curative approach. However, the long-term outcomes of such a strategy are poor: the 5-year overall survival from first relapse for patients with acute leukemia is only approximately 10%. This Perspective highlights the fact that most patients do not achieve CR2 and therefore never really have an opportunity for a potential curative therapy. Although patients who undergo transplantation after relapse may be cured, those who do not achieve CR2 are rarely candidates for transplantation; therefore, the overall outcome for patients who relapse is dismal. There is therefore an urgent need not only for more effective upfront therapy to prevent relapse, but also for the development of therapies that can serve as effective bridging treatments between relapse and transplantation. We suggest that more optimal use of minimal residual disease detection during first remission may also improve the chances for successful transplantation therapy via earlier reinduction therapy, allowing transplantation before overt relapse.",,"['Forman, Stephen J', 'Rowe, Jacob M']","['Forman SJ', 'Rowe JM']","['Department of Hematology and Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, City of Hope, Duarte, CA 91010, USA. sforman@coh.org']",['eng'],"['P01 CA030206/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA033572/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA 30206/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA33572/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",20121214,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,['Blood. 2014 Jan 30;123(5):794.

Three distinct binding domains targeting CD22 were fused to various TCR signaling domains +/- an IgG heavy chain constant domain (CH2CH3) to create a series of vector constructs suitable to delineate optimal CAR configuration. CARs derived from the m971 anti-CD22 mAb, which targets a proximal CD22 epitope demonstrated superior antileukemic activity compared with those incorporating other binding domains, and addition of a 4-1BB signaling domain to CD28.CD3 constructs diminished potency, whereas increasing affinity of the anti-CD22 binding motif, and extending the CD22 binding domain away from the membrane via CH2CH3 had no effect.

Megakaryoblast leukemia 1 (MKL1), an activator of serum response factor (SRF) transcriptional activity, promotes muscle, neuron, and megakaryocyte differentiation. In muscle cells, where MKL1 subcellular localization is one mechanism by which cells control SRF activity, MKL1 translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in response to actin polymerization is critical for its function as a transcriptional regulator. MKL1 localization is cell-type specific; it is predominantly cytoplasmic in unstimulated fibroblasts and some muscle cell types and is constitutively nuclear in neuronal cells. In the present study, we report that in megakaryocytes, subcellular localization and regulation of MKL1 is dependent on RhoA activity and actin organization. Induction of megakaryocytic differentiation of human erythroleukemia cells by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate and primary megakaryocytes by thrombopoietin promotes MKL1 nuclear localization. This MKL1 localization is blocked by drugs inhibiting RhoA activity or actin polymerization.We also show that nuclear-localized MKL1 activates the transcription of SRF target genes.

KIR/HLA mismatched hematopoietic stem cell transplants induce alloreactive NK cells, which prevent leukemia relapse. Certain KIR/HLA combinations protect against HIV-1 infection, but the effect of KIR/HLA mismatches between sexual partners has never been investigated. In this study, we analyzed the effect of allogeneic KIR/HLA combinations on HIV-1 transmission in a West African population of HIV-1-discordant and concordant couples. HIV-1-discordant couples were characterized by recipient partners with homozygous KIR2DL2, and by a mismatched recipient partner KIR2DL1/HLA-C2 with index partner HLA-C1/C1 combination expected to allow licensed missing self NK cell killing of index partners' cells. HIV-1-concordant couples on the other hand were characterized by KIR2DL3 homozygous recipient partners with HLA-C1/C2 bearing index partners, resulting in a matched KIR/HLA combination expected to inhibit NK cell killing. In vitro cocultures of healthy donor-derived NK cells and HIV-1 patient-derived CD4(+) T cells confirmed the involvement of these allogeneic KIR/HLA combinations in NK cell-mediated CD4(+) T-cell killing.

By integrating mutational and cytogenetic analysis in 1274 CLL samples and using both a training-validation and a time-dependent design, 4 CLL subgroups were hierarchically classified: (1) high-risk, harboring TP53 and/or BIRC3 abnormalities (10-year survival: 29%); (2) intermediate-risk, harboring NOTCH1 and/or SF3B1 mutations and/or del11q22-q23 (10-year survival: 37%); (3) low-risk, harboring +12 or a normal genetics (10-year survival: 57%); and (4) very low-risk, harboring del13q14 only, whose 10-year survival (69.3%) did not significantly differ from a matched general population. This integrated mutational and cytogenetic model independently predicted survival, improved CLL prognostication accuracy compared with FISH karyotype (P < .0001), and was externally validated in an independent CLL cohort. Clonal evolution from lower to higher risk implicated the emergence of NOTCH1, SF3B1, and BIRC3 abnormalities in addition to TP53 and 11q22-q23 lesions. By taking into account clonal evolution through time-dependent analysis, the genetic model maintained its prognostic relevance at any time from diagnosis.

We observed that bortezomib sensitized AML cells to ATRA-induced morphologic, biochemical, and functional changes, indicative of myeloid differentiation without cell death. In addition, treatment of human leukemia HL60 xenografts with bortezomib and ATRA together did not increase bortezomib-induced progressive weight loss but resulted in significant tumor growth inhibition in addition to increased differentiation (P < 0.05). These enhanced differentiation effects were accompanied by RARalpha stabilization and STAT1 activation.

The antitumor activity of triptolide is associated with its biologic activities, as it inhibits various proproliferative or antiapoptotic factors that are dominantly expressed in given types of cancer cells. Herein, we show that triptolide induced apoptosis in a subgroup of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells overexpressing the MDM2 oncoprotein by inhibiting MDM2 expression. More specifically, we found that triptolide inhibited MDM2 at the transcriptional level by suppressing its mRNA synthesis. This MDM2 inhibition led in turn to increased levels of p53 protein; however, p53 functionality was not activated due to the fact that triptolide-treated cells lacked induction of p21 and PUMA as well as in G(1) cell-cycle arrest. Triptolide-mediated downregulation of MDM2 increased inhibition of X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP), its translational target, in a manner distinct from reactions to cellular stress and DNA-damaging agent ionizing radiation that induce XIAP due to p53-activated MDM2. These results suggest that increased inhibition of XIAP due to downregulation of MDM2 may play a critical role in triptolide-induced apoptosis in MDM2-overexpressing cancers.",['(c)2012 AACR.'],"['Huang, Mei', 'Zhang, Hailong', 'Liu, Tao', 'Tian, Dan', 'Gu, Lubing', 'Zhou, Muxiang']","['Huang M', 'Zhang H', 'Liu T', 'Tian D', 'Gu L', 'Zhou M']","['Department of Pediatrics, Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia 30322, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA123490/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA143107/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA143107/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121212,United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '0 (Diterpenes)', '0 (Epoxy Compounds)', '0 (Phenanthrenes)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '19ALD1S53J (triptolide)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (MDM2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2)']",IM,,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Child', 'Diterpenes/*pharmacology', 'Epoxy Compounds/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Phenanthrenes/*pharmacology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2/*antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*metabolism']",PMC3570632,['NIHMS426556'],2012/12/18 06:00,2013/12/24 06:00,['2012/12/18 06:00'],"['2012/12/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/24 06:00 [medline]']","['1535-7163.MCT-12-0425 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-12-0425 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2013 Feb;12(2):184-94. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-12-0425.

Tetracycline-inducible Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL dual knockdown sharply increased PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitor lethality. Conversely, inducible knockdown or dominant-negative AKT increased, whereas constitutively active AKT reduced lethality of the Bcl-2/Bcl-xL inhibitor ABT-737. Furthermore, PI3K/mTOR inhibitors (e.g., BEZ235 and PI-103) synergistically increased ABT-737-mediated cell death in multiple leukemia cell lines and reduced colony formation in leukemic, but not normal, CD34+ cells. Notably, increased lethality was observed in four of six primary acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) specimens. Responding, but not nonresponding, samples exhibited basal AKT phosphorylation. PI3K/mTOR inhibitors markedly downregulated Mcl-1 but increased Bim binding to Bcl-2/Bcl-xL; the latter effect was abrogated by ABT-737. Combined treatment also markedly diminished Bax/Bak binding to Mcl-1, Bcl-2, or Bcl-xL. Bax, Bak, or Bim (BCL2L11) knockdown or Mcl-1 overexpression significantly diminished regimen-induced apoptosis. Interestingly, pharmacologic inhibition or short hairpin RNA knockdown of GSK3alpha/beta significantly attenuated Mcl-1 downregulation and decreased apoptosis. In a systemic AML xenograft model, dual tetracycline-inducible knockdown of Bcl-2/Bcl-xL sharply increased BEZ235 antileukemic effects. In a subcutaneous xenograft model, BEZ235 and ABT-737 coadministration significantly diminished tumor growth, downregulated Mcl-1, activated caspases, and prolonged survival. Together, these findings suggest that antileukemic synergism between PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitors and BH3 mimetics involves multiple mechanisms, including Mcl-1 downregulation, release of Bim from Bcl-2/Bcl-xL as well as Bak and Bax from Mcl-1/Bcl-2/Bcl-xL, and GSK3alpha/beta, culminating in Bax/Bak activation and apoptosis. They also argue that combining PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitors with BH3 mimetics warrants attention in AML, particularly in the setting of basal AKT activation and/or addiction.",,"['Rahmani, Mohamed', 'Aust, Mandy Mayo', 'Attkisson, Elisa', 'Williams, David C Jr', 'Ferreira-Gonzalez, Andrea', 'Grant, Steven']","['Rahmani M', 'Aust MM', 'Attkisson E', 'Williams DC Jr', 'Ferreira-Gonzalez A', 'Grant S']","['Department of Medicine, Virginia Commonwealth University, The Virginia Institute for Molecular Medicine and Massey Cancer Center, Richmond, VA 23298, USA. mrahmani@vcu.edu']",['eng'],"['P50 CA142509/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA100866-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA130805/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA100866/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA093738/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA167708/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'RC2 CA148431/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA142509/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA93738/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA148431/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA130805/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121212,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (ABT-737)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BAK1 protein, human)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (BCL2L11 protein, human)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Bcl2l11 protein, mouse)', '0 (Biphenyl Compounds)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Nitrophenols)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Quinolines)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.26 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3)', 'RUJ6Z9Y0DT (dactolisib)']",IM,['Nat Rev Clin Oncol. 2013 Feb;10(2):67.

NK cell based anti-tumor immunotherapy was so far mainly successful in patients with different types of leukemia. For instance, acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients displayed a prolonged survival if transplanted with haploidentical stem cells giving rise to NK cells with a mismatch in inhibitory killer immunoglobulin receptors (KIRs) and recipients' HLA class I. Although promising results have been achieved with hematological tumors, solid tumors are in most cases poorly controlled by NK cells. Therapeutic protocols that aimed at improving NK cell responses in patients with solid malignancies succeeded in increasing NK cell numbers and functional responses of NK cells isolated from the patients' peripheral blood. However, in the majority of cases tumor progression and overall survival of patients were not significantly improved. There is increasing evidence that tumor-associated NK cells become gradually impaired during tumor progression compared to NK cells from peripheral blood and healthy tissues. Future protocols of NK cell based immunotherapy should integrate three important aspects to improve NK cell anti-tumor activity: facilitating NK cell migration to the tumor site, enhancing their infiltration into the tumor tissue and ensuring subsequent efficient activation in the tumor.

We evaluated the efficacy and safety of azacitidine in combination with lenalidomide as front-line therapy for older patients with acute myeloid leukemia. Patients >/= 60 years of age with untreated acute myeloid leukemia received azacitidine 75 mg/m2 for 7 days followed by escalating doses of lenalidomide daily for 21 days starting on day 8 of each cycle every 6 weeks. Patients received continued therapy until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or completion of 12 cycles. Forty-two patients (median age, 74 years) were enrolled with equal distribution according to European LeukemiaNet risk. The overall response rate was 40% (rate of complete remission with or without complete recovery of blood counts = 28%). The median time to complete remission with or without complete recovery of blood counts was 12 weeks, and duration of this status was 28 weeks (range, 4 - >104 weeks). Therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia and a high score on the Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation Comorbidity Index were negative predictors of response. Early death was noted in 17% of patients.

To achieve this patients undergo intensive treatment that usually takes 2.5-3.5 years involving on average 15 different chemotherapeutic drugs. In 1971, Donald Pinkel reported Total Therapy-Protocol V that used 5 drugs and cranial radiation therapy over a similar time period. Today, one half of these patients (Pinkel's children) remain alive and free of leukaemia. AIM: The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact post-induction minimal residual disease (MRD) levels had on survival and its relationship with the more established clinical and biological prognostic predictors of outcome in the hope of identifying a subgroup of patients that are at very low risk of failure. METHODS: A retrospective review of 250 Irish children with ALL was carried out. MRD status after 28 days of induction chemotherapy and other known predictors of outcome were correlated with 5 year event-free survival (EFS). RESULTS: MRD status was the strongest predictor of outcome with 5 year EFS rates greater that 90% seen in those patients with low-risk MRD and this was associated with TEL/AML1 rearrangement, high hyperdiploidy (HH) karyotype and female gender. CONCLUSION: Both MRD and karyotype are powerful determinants of outcome in childhood ALL. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the majority of children cured by Pinkel et al. in the late 1960s were most likely composed of low-risk MRD, TEL/AML1 and HH patients.",,"['Krawczyk, J', 'Maguire, S', 'Sandys, N', 'Kelly, J', 'Ryan, C', ""O'Marcaigh, A"", 'Storey, L', 'Rooney, S', 'Phillips, C', 'Smith, O P']","['Krawczyk J', 'Maguire S', 'Sandys N', 'Kelly J', 'Ryan C', ""O'Marcaigh A"", 'Storey L', 'Rooney S', 'Phillips C', 'Smith OP']","[""Department of Haematology, Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin, Dublin, 12, Ireland. jkrawczyk@pro.onet.pl""]",['eng'],,"['Historical Article', 'Journal Article']",20121216,Ireland,Ir J Med Sci,Irish journal of medical science,7806864,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (TEL-AML1 fusion protein)']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/genetics', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Genotype', 'History, 20th Century', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Karyotype', 'Male', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*epidemiology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*epidemiology/*genetics/history', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate']",,,2012/12/18 06:00,2014/06/18 06:00,['2012/12/18 06:00'],"['2012/09/19 00:00 [received]', '2012/12/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/12/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11845-012-0892-8 [doi]'],ppublish,Ir J Med Sci. 2013 Sep;182(3):377-82. doi: 10.1007/s11845-012-0892-8.

Although the composition of the 20S catalytic core particle (CP) has been well documented, little is known about the composition and dynamics of the regulatory complexes that play a crucial role in its activity, or about how they associate with the CP in different cell compartments, different cell lines, and in response to external stimuli. Because of difficulties performing acceptable cell fractionation while maintaining complex integrity, it has been challenging to characterize proteasome complexes by proteomic approaches. Here, we report an integrated protocol, combining a cross-linking procedure on intact cells with cell fractionation, proteasome immuno-purification, and robust label-free quantitative proteomic analysis by mass spectrometry to determine the distribution and dynamics of cellular proteasome complexes in leukemic cells. Activity profiles of proteasomes were correlated fully with the composition of protein complexes and stoichiometry. Moreover, our results suggest that, at the subcellular level, proteasome function is regulated by dynamic interactions between the 20S CP and its regulatory proteins-which modulate proteasome activity, stability, localization, or substrate uptake-rather than by profound changes in 20S CP composition. Proteasome plasticity was observed both in the 20S CP and in its network of interactions following IFNgamma stimulation. The fractionation protocol also revealed specific proteolytic activities and structural features of low-abundance microsomal proteasomes from U937 and KG1a cells.

In a developing country, patients are often unable to reach hospital speedily. Our aim was to determine the symptom to door interval (SDI) in febrile neutropenic children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia [ALL] and to identify factors resulting in delay. METHODS: All consecutive children of ALL (< 14 years) presenting with FN over a period of 1 year were evaluated. Data for demographics, clinical details, phase of therapy, profile of caregivers, travelling time, SDI, reasons for delay, modes of transport, complications, invasive bacterial infections (IBI), length of hospital stay and outcome were recorded. RESULTS: Among 320 FN episodes, median SDI (in hours) was 24 (IQR 8, 36). SDI during intensive phases was significantly less as compared to nonintensive phases 12 (IQR 6, 24) and 24 (IQR 24, 48) (p < 0.001). Children on induction phase reported to hospital at earliest [median 8 (IQR 4, 12)], while those on maintenance phase came late [median 36 (24, 48)]. Median travelling time was 15 min (IQR 15, 25) for patients on intensive phase and was 180 min (IQR 60, 285) for those on nonintensive phase (p< 0.001). Ingestion of acetaminophen at home (30 %), inability to realise the gravity of the situation (27 %), unawareness of parents (9 %) and nonavailability of transport (12 %) were the most common reasons for delay. No significant association of SDI was seen with complications, IBI, duration of hospital stay and mortality (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Considerable time lag was seen between onset of symptoms and reaching hospital.

IFN1@ activated the cellular autophagic machinery in immortalized or primary CML cells. Activation of JAK1-STAT1 and RELA signaling were required for IFN1@-induced expression of BECN1, a key regulator of autophagy.

In this work, we studied the involvement of RANK-RANKL interaction in NK cell-mediated immunosurveillance of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Substantial levels of RANKL were found to be expressed on leukemia cells in 53 of 78 (68%) investigated patients. Signaling via RANKL into the leukemia cells stimulated their metabolic activity and induced the release of cytokines involved in AML pathophysiology. In addition, the immunomodulatory factors released by AML cells upon RANKL signaling impaired the anti-leukemia reactivity of NK cells and induced RANK expression, and NK cells of AML patients displayed significantly upregulated RANK expression compared with healthy controls. Treatment of AML cells with the clinically available RANKL Ab Denosumab resulted in enhanced NK cell anti-leukemia reactivity. This was due to both blockade of the release of NK-inhibitory factors by AML cells and prevention of RANK signaling into NK cells. The latter was found to directly impair NK anti-leukemia reactivity with a more pronounced effect on IFN-gamma production compared with cytotoxicity. Together, our data unravel a previously unknown function of the RANK-RANKL molecule system in AML pathophysiology as well as NK cell function and suggest that neutralization of RANKL with therapeutic Abs may serve to reinforce NK cell reactivity in leukemia patients.",,"['Schmiedel, Benjamin Joachim', 'Nuebling, Tina', 'Steinbacher, Julia', 'Malinovska, Alexandra', 'Wende, Constantin Maximilian', 'Azuma, Miyuki', 'Schneider, Pascal', 'Grosse-Hovest, Ludger', 'Salih, Helmut Rainer']","['Schmiedel BJ', 'Nuebling T', 'Steinbacher J', 'Malinovska A', 'Wende CM', 'Azuma M', 'Schneider P', 'Grosse-Hovest L', 'Salih HR']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Eberhard Karls University, 72076 Tuebingen, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121214,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (RANK Ligand)', '0 (Receptor Activator of Nuclear Factor-kappa B)', '4EQZ6YO2HI (Denosumab)']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Denosumab', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Immunomodulation/drug effects', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*immunology/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Protein Binding', 'RANK Ligand/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptor Activator of Nuclear Factor-kappa B/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Young Adult']",,,2012/12/18 06:00,2013/03/15 06:00,['2012/12/18 06:00'],"['2012/12/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/15 06:00 [medline]']","['jimmunol.1201792 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1201792 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2013 Jan 15;190(2):821-31. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1201792.

In this study, we report intraclonal diversity resolved by responses to CD19 engagement in CLL cells, which can be classified into CD19-responsive (CD19-R) and -nonresponive subpopulations. Engagement of CD19 by anti-CD19 Ab rapidly induced cellular aggregation in the CD19-R CLL cells. The CD19-R CLL cells expressed higher surface levels of CD19 and c-myc mRNA, exhibited distinct morphological features, and were preferentially abolished in rituximab-treated patients. Both subpopulations reacted to sIgM stimulation in a similar manner and exhibited similar levels of Akt and Erk phosphorylation, pointing to functional signaling divergence within the BCR. CD19 unresponsiveness was partially reversible, where nonresponding CD19 cells spontaneously recover their signaling capacity following incubation in vitro, pointing to possible in vivo CD19-signaling attenuating mechanisms. This concept was supported by the lower CD19-R occurrence in bone marrow-derived samples compared with cells derived from the peripheral blood of the same patients. CLL patients with >15.25% of the CD19-R cell fraction had a shorter median time to treatment compared with patients with <15.25% of CD19-R cell fraction. In conclusion, divergence in CD19-mediated signaling unfolds both interpatient and intraclonal diversity in CLL. This signaling diversity is associated with physiological implications, including the location of the cells, their responses to anti-CLL therapeutics, and disease progression.",,"['Herishanu, Yair', 'Kay, Sigi', 'Dezorella, Nili', 'Baron, Shoshana', 'Hazan-Halevy, Inbal', 'Porat, Ziv', 'Trestman, Svetlana', 'Perry, Chava', 'Braunstein, Rony', 'Deutsch, Varda', 'Polliack, Aaron', 'Naparstek, Elizabeth', 'Katz, Ben-Zion']","['Herishanu Y', 'Kay S', 'Dezorella N', 'Baron S', 'Hazan-Halevy I', 'Porat Z', 'Trestman S', 'Perry C', 'Braunstein R', 'Deutsch V', 'Polliack A', 'Naparstek E', 'Katz BZ']","['Department of Hematology, Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center, Tel Aviv 64239, Israel.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121212,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', '97C5T2UQ7J (Cholesterol)']",IM,,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived/pharmacology', 'Antigens, CD19/*metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cholesterol/metabolism', 'Disease Progression', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*metabolism', 'Membrane Microdomains/chemistry/drug effects/metabolism', 'Rituximab', '*Signal Transduction/drug effects']",,,2012/12/18 06:00,2013/03/15 06:00,['2012/12/18 06:00'],"['2012/12/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/15 06:00 [medline]']","['jimmunol.1200615 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1200615 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2013 Jan 15;190(2):784-93. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1200615.

METHODS: Clinical and laboratory data of 20 patients with ANKL were collected retrospectively from a single medical center. RESULTS: The prominent clinical complications included unexplained fever, interstitial pneumonia, hepatosplenomegaly, high level of lactate dehydrogenase and liver dysfunction. Both bone marrow (BM) biopsies and aspiration of 20 patients were morphologically and immunophenotypically evaluated. Only 2 patients with marked elevation of peripheral large granular lymphocytes had sufficient BM aspiration for flow cytometric immunophenotyping. However, 20 BM biopsies showed marked neoplastic cell infiltration, and immunohistochemistry highlighted patterns of neoplastic involvement. The neoplastic cells were mainly positive for CD2, CD56, (Equation is included in full-text article.)and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-encoded RNA. The plasma EBV-DNA test was positive in all cases, and complex cytogenetic abnormalities were identified in 8 cases. The median survival of the patients was 8 weeks, and the presence of liver dysfunction-induced jaundice (serum total bilirubin level > 34.2 mumol/L) was identified as a risk factor for early death. Patients were generally resistant to chemotherapy, but notably, 3 patients demonstrated a marked response to gemcitabine with tolerable toxicities. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that ANKL is a highly aggressive leukemia with a fulminating clinical course. A BM biopsy with immunohistochemistry and EBV-encoded RNA detection is mandatory for a rapid diagnosis of ANKL. Therefore, a careful evaluation and fully supported treatment plan should be conducted before chemotherapy is administered to patients with severe complications to improve the overall survival.",,"['Zhang, Hongyu', 'Meng, Qinxiang', 'Yin, Weihua', 'Xu, Lei', 'Lie, Liping']","['Zhang H', 'Meng Q', 'Yin W', 'Xu L', 'Lie L']","['Departments of Hematology, Peking University ShenZhen Hospital, ShenZhen, China. zyiqu@yahoo.com.cn']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Am J Med Sci,The American journal of the medical sciences,0370506,"['0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Biopsy', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'DNA, Viral/blood', 'Female', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/drug therapy/immunology/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2012/12/18 06:00,2013/08/30 06:00,['2012/12/18 06:00'],"['2012/12/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/30 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/MAJ.0b013e3182764b59 [doi]', 'S0002-9629(15)30612-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Am J Med Sci. 2013 Jul;346(1):56-63. doi: 10.1097/MAJ.0b013e3182764b59.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Multiple genetic aberrations occur during the clonal evolution of MDS; however, few studies report the presence of the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome. We report a rare case of Ph-positive AML, which evolved during the course of low-risk MDS. The patient, a 76-year-old man with mild leukocytopenia, was diagnosed with MDS, refractory neutropenia (RN). After 1.5 yr, his peripheral blood and bone marrow were suddenly occupied by immature basophils and myeloblasts, indicating the onset of AML. A bone marrow smear showed multilineage dysplasia, consistent with MDS evolution. Chromosomal analysis showed an additional t(9;22)(q34;q11) translocation. Because progression occurred concurrently with emergence of the Ph chromosome, we diagnosed this case as Ph-positive AML with basophilia arising from the clonal evolution of MDS.

In clinical trials, they have both been reported to cause rash in a significant number of patients, but its incidence varies significantly and has not been characterized clinically or histologically. The aim of this study was to determine the incidence of rash with nilotinib and dasatinib, and to provide a clinical and histopathological description of the rash. METHODS: We conducted a meta-analysis of clinical trials evaluating nilotinib and dasatinib to determine and compare the incidence of rash with these medications. Additionally, we performed a retrospective chart review to analyze the clinical presentation and histology of patients presenting with rash. RESULTS: The incidence of all-grade (grade 1-4) rash with nilotinib was 34.3% (95% CI, 27.9-41.3), higher (P = 0.017) than with dasatinib (23.3%; 95% CI, 18.8-28.6). Similarly, the incidence of high-grade rash with nilotinib (2.6%; 95% CI, 2.1-3.4) was higher (P = 0.002) than with dasatinib (1.1%; 95% CI, 0.8-1.6). The clinical presentation often consisted of a pruritic, perifollicular hyperkeratotic, occasionally erythematous papular rash affecting most areas of the body, depending on the severity.

Moreover, low transgene expression in primary human B cells has impeded the use of LVVs for this target cell. We investigated the transduction potential of gibbon-ape leukemia virus (GALV) Env-pseudotyped LVVs for primary human B cells. By establishing optimized transduction kinetics and multiplicities of infection, we were able to regularly obtain transduction efficiencies of more than 50% in CD40L-activated B cells. Noteworthy, with the use of GALV-pseudotyped LVVs we could achieve a more than 10-fold higher yield of transduced activated B cells in direct comparison with LVVs pseudotyped with measles virus glycoproteins. Phenotyping of transduced primary B cells revealed a majority of memory B cells, a long-lived phenotype, presumed to be well suited for enduring therapeutic interventions. Finally, by combining the enhancer (Emu) and the matrix/scaffold-attachment regions (MARs) of the human immunoglobulin heavy chain with the promoter of spleen focus-forming virus (SFFV) we aimed at generating a novel LVV particularly suitable for B cell transgenesis. We show that the optimized vector facilitated significantly higher transgene expression in various B cell lines and, more importantly, primary human B cells (mean factor of three).

Only 4 years ago, AML was re-classified, based on karyotypic abnormalities. However, numerous important new mutations and other genetic abnormalities that were not considered in this classification have been identified. Current cytogenetic-based classification is limited by the substantial number of intermediate-risk patients in whom the preferred therapy is debatable. In addition, the majority of AML patients co-express multiple mutations and cannot be easily categorized into predefined homogenous groups. The tremendous progress in mass sequencing allows parallel identification of multiple genetic aberrations in large cohorts. Thus, a new concept of genetic profiling has arisen. Genes and proteins biologically interact with each other; therefore, it should not be surprising that mutations in different genes interact. Prognosis is determined by the composition of mutations and aberrations in leukaemic stem cells. As a consequence, clinical decisions no longer rely on scant genetic data and require comprehensive genetic evaluation.

Histone H3K4 and H3K9 trimethylation associate as a general rule, with open and silenced chromatin, respectively, for ES cell pluripotency maintenance. However, how histone modifications are regulated to maintain open chromatin in ES cells remains largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that trithorax protein Ash2l, homologue of the Drosophila Ash2 (absent, small, homeotic-2) protein, is a key regulator of open chromatin in ES cells. Consistent with Ash2l being a core subunit of mixed lineage leukemia methyltransferase complex, RNAi knockdown of Ash2l was sufficient to reduce H3K4 methylation levels and drive ES cells to a silenced chromatin state with high H3K9 trimethylation. Genome-wide ChIP-seq analysis indicated that Ash2l is recruited to target loci through two distinct modes and enriched at a family of genes implicated in open chromatin regulation, including chromatin remodeler Cdh7, transcription factor c-Myc, and H3K9 demethylase Kdm4c.

The vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and Notch/Dll4 pathways have been identified as critical in the regulation of embryonic vascular development and tumor angiogenesis. However, the potential role of the Notch/Dll4 pathway in leukemia-endothelium cross-talk and its functional link with VEGF remains obscure. This study assessed the expression of VEGF and Notch/Dll4 pathway molecules in primary AML and investigated their biological function in the coculture of endothelial cells with AML cells. The results demonstrated that bone marrow vascularity in the newly diagnosed AML patients was increased and correlated with high VEGF and Dll4 expression. Patients with untreated AML expressed higher levels of VEGFR2, Notch1, Dll4 and Hes1 than healthy controls. Moreover, the activation of the Notch/Dll4 pathway is associated with poor prognosis in AML. In addition, AML cells were shown to increase endothelial cell proliferation in Transwell coculture. This was associated with concomitant activation of the Notch/Dll4 pathway and upregulation of its downstream genes, such as matrix metalloproteinases, resulting in the enhancement of endothelial cell migration and tube formation. Our study also showed that upregulation of Dll4 expression in AML cells by cDNA transfection suppressed VEGF-induced endothelial cell proliferation and angiogenesis in direct contact coculture. These results elucidate a novel mechanism by which the interplay between AML and endothelial cells promotes angiogenesis through the Notch/Dll4 pathway. Modulation of this pathway may, therefore, hold promise as a novel antiangiogenic strategy for the treatment of AML.",,"['Zhang, Jingru', 'Ye, Jingjing', 'Ma, Daoxin', 'Liu, Na', 'Wu, Hao', 'Yu, Shuang', 'Sun, Xiulian', 'Tse, William', 'Ji, Chunyan']","['Zhang J', 'Ye J', 'Ma D', 'Liu N', 'Wu H', 'Yu S', 'Sun X', 'Tse W', 'Ji C']","['Department of Hematology, Qilu Hospital, Shandong University, Jinan 250012, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121213,England,Carcinogenesis,Carcinogenesis,8008055,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Calcium-Binding Proteins)', '0 (DLL4 protein, human)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (NOTCH1 protein, human)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '0 (VEGFA protein, human)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2)']",IM,,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Bone Marrow/blood supply/pathology', 'Calcium-Binding Proteins', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Movement', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Down-Regulation', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells/metabolism/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism/mortality/*pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic/metabolism/*pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Receptor, Notch1/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2/genetics/metabolism', 'Young Adult']",,,2012/12/15 06:00,2013/04/23 06:00,['2012/12/15 06:00'],"['2012/12/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/12/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/23 06:00 [medline]']","['bgs386 [pii]', '10.1093/carcin/bgs386 [doi]']",ppublish,Carcinogenesis. 2013 Mar;34(3):667-77. doi: 10.1093/carcin/bgs386.

Complementary efforts using the genome-wide association study approach have shown indisputable evidence that common low penetrance genetic polymorphisms contribute to childhood ALL risk. However, current calculations show that these established disease loci only explain a portion of the total estimated contribution of common genetic variation on childhood ALL risk.

The impact of AEA and NAGly on store-operated Ca(2+) entry (SOCE), a ubiquitous Ca(2+) entry pathway regulating many cellular functions, is unknown. Here we show that NAGly, but not AEA reversibly hinders SOCE in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. The inhibitory effect of NAGly on SOCE was found in the human endothelial cell line EA.hy926, the rat pancreatic beta-cell line INS-1 832/13, and the rat basophilic leukemia cell line RBL-2H3. NAGly diminished SOCE independently from the mode of Ca(2+) depletion of the endoplasmic reticulum, whereas it had no effect on Ca(2+) entry through L-type voltage-gated Ca(2+) channels. Enhanced Ca(2+) entry was effectively hampered by NAGly in cells overexpressing the key molecular constituents of SOCE, stromal interacting molecule 1 (STIM1) and the pore-forming subunit of SOCE channels, Orai1. Fluorescence microscopy revealed that NAGly did not affect STIM1 oligomerization, STIM1 clustering, or the colocalization of STIM1 with Orai1, which were induced by Ca(2+) depletion of the endoplasmic reticulum. In contrast, independently from its slow depolarizing effect on mitochondria, NAGly instantly and strongly diminished the interaction of STIM1 with Orai1, indicating that NAGly inhibits SOCE primarily by uncoupling STIM1 from Orai1. In summary, our findings revealed the STIM1-Orai1-mediated SOCE machinery as a molecular target of NAGly, which might have many implications in cell physiology.",,"['Deak, Andras T', 'Groschner, Lukas N', 'Alam, Muhammad Rizwan', 'Seles, Elisabeth', 'Bondarenko, Alexander I', 'Graier, Wolfgang F', 'Malli, Roland']","['Deak AT', 'Groschner LN', 'Alam MR', 'Seles E', 'Bondarenko AI', 'Graier WF', 'Malli R']","['Institute of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, Center of Molecular Medicine, Medical University Graz, Graz, Austria.']",['eng'],"['P 21857/Austrian Science Fund FWF/Austria', 'P 22553/Austrian Science Fund FWF/Austria']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121213,England,J Cell Sci,Journal of cell science,0052457,"['0 (Arachidonic Acids)', '0 (Calcium Channels)', '0 (Endocannabinoids)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (N-arachidonylglycine)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (ORAI1 Protein)', '0 (ORAI1 protein, human)', '0 (STIM1 protein, human)', '0 (Stromal Interaction Molecule 1)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)', 'TE7660XO1C (Glycine)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Arachidonic Acids/*pharmacology', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Calcium Channels/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Endocannabinoids/*pharmacology', 'Endothelial Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Glycine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Membrane Proteins/*metabolism', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'ORAI1 Protein', 'Protein Binding/drug effects', 'Rats', 'Stromal Interaction Molecule 1']",PMC3614444,['EMS50977'],2012/12/15 06:00,2013/11/20 06:00,['2012/12/15 06:00'],"['2012/12/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/12/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/20 06:00 [medline]']","['jcs.118075 [pii]', '10.1242/jcs.118075 [doi]']",ppublish,J Cell Sci. 2013 Feb 15;126(Pt 4):879-88. doi: 10.1242/jcs.118075.

Cell cycle distribution and apoptosis were monitored by flow cytometry. The activation of casepase-9, Bcl-2-associated agonist of cell death (BAD), p-BAD, p27, phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten (PTEN), Akt, p-Akt was assessed by Western blot analysis. The expression of PTEN mRNA was tested by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis. RESULTS: CA reduced HL-60 cell viability in a dose- and time-dependent manner, and induced G1 arrest and apoptosis. Moreover, CA upregulated PTEN expression, blocked the Akt signaling pathway, subsequently inhibited phosphorylation of BAD, reactivated caspase-9, and elevated levels of p27.

The progression and invasion of PCa are normally mediated by the overexpression of chemokine receptors (CKRs) and the interaction between CKRs and their cognate ligands. We recently demonstrated that venom extracted from Walterinnesia aegyptia (WEV) either alone or in combination with silica nanoparticles (WEV+NP) mediated the growth arrest and apoptosis of breast cancer cells. In the present study, we evaluated the impact of WEV alone and WEV+NP on the migration, invasion, proliferation and apoptosis of prostate cancer cells. We found that WEV alone and WEV+NP decreased the viability of all cell types tested (PCa cells isolated from patient samples, PC3 cells and LNCaP cells) using an MTT assay. The IC(50) values were determined to be 10 and 5 mug/mL for WEV alone and WEV+NP, respectively. WEV+NP decreased the surface expression of the CKRs CXCR3, CXCR4, CXCR5 and CXCR6 to a greater extent than WEV alone and subsequently reduced migration and the invasion response of the cells to the cognate ligands of the CKRs (CXCL10, CXCL12, CXCL13 and CXCL16, respectively). Using a CFSE proliferation assay, we found that WEV+NP strongly inhibited epidermal growth factor-mediated PCa cell proliferation. Furthermore, analysis of the cell cycle indicated that WEV+NP strongly altered the cell cycle of PCa cells and enhanced the induction of apoptosis. Finally, we demonstrated that WEV+NP robustly decreased the expression of anti-apoptotic effectors, such as B cell Lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), B cell Lymphoma-extra large (Bcl-(XL)) and myeloid cell leukemia sequence-1 (Mcl-1), and increased the expression of pro-apoptotic effectors, such as Bcl-2 homologous antagonist/killer (Bak), Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax) and Bcl-2-interacting mediator of cell death (Bim).

We retrospectively reviewed peripheral blood (PB) and bone marrow (BM) slides of 208 patients prepared at the time of diagnosis of AML based on the results of testing for mutations of both NPM1 exon 12 and FLT3. We investigated the association between this phenotype and hematologic findings, disease markers, and mutations in NPM1 exon 12, FLT3-internal tandem duplication (ITD), and tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) genes. Cup-like nuclei were found in 44 patients (21.2 %) diagnosed with AML. This morphology was associated with high blast counts in the PB and BM; AML type, especially AML M1 (FAB classification); low CD34 expression; and mutation of FLT3-ITD, -TKD, NPM1 regardless of other mutations (p < 0.05 for all). However, FLT3-ITD or TKD mutation alone (nine cases, p = 0.228) was not associated, and NPM1 mutation alone (14 cases, p = 0.036) was weakly associated with cup-like nuclei. Mutation of both NPM1 and FLT3-ITD or TKD (17 cases, p < 0.001) was strongly correlated with the cup-like nuclear morphology. AML with cup-like nuclei is strongly associated with co-occurring mutations of both NPM1 and FLT3-ITD or TKD.

In this line, ponatinib (AP24534) has emerged as a promising therapeutic option in patients with all kinds of BCR-ABL mutations, especially the T315I one. However and surprisingly, the effect of ponatinib has not been extensively studied on imatinib-resistant CML cell lines. Therefore, in the present study, we used several CML cell lines with different mechanisms of resistance to TKI to evaluate the effect of ponatinib on cell viability, apoptosis and signaling. Our results show that ponatinib is highly effective on both sensitive and resistant CML cell lines, whatever the mode of resistance and also on BaF3 murine B cells carrying native BCR-ABL or T315I mutation.

Sonic hedgehog (Shh) is expressed in AML biopsies and is essential for the drug resistance of cancer stem cells of AML. AML patients are frequently infected by bacteria and exposed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS). LPS itself, its derivatives, and its downstream effectors, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interferons (IFNs), have been shown to provoke anti-tumor effects.

Although imatinib has profoundly improved outcomes for patients with CML, it has limitations. Most significantly, imatinib cannot eradicate CML primitive progenitors, which likely accounts for the high relapse rate when imatinib is discontinued. IFNalpha, unlike imatinib, preferentially targets CML stem cells. Early studies with IFNalpha in CML demonstrated its ability to induce cytogenetic remission. Moreover, a small percentage of patients treated with IFNalpha were able to sustain durable remissions after discontinuing therapy and were probably cured. The mechanisms by which IFNalpha exerts its antitumor activity in CML are not well understood; however, activation of leukemia-specific immunity may have a role. Some clinical studies have demonstrated that the combination of imatinib and IFNalpha is superior to either therapy alone, perhaps because of their different mechanisms of action. Nonetheless, the side effects of IFNalpha often impede its administration, especially in combination therapy.

Detailed precoded information derived from a personal interview conducted by specially trained health personnel with the child guardians was available for 883 ALL and 111 AML incident childhood cases registered in the Nationwide Registry for Childhood Hematological Malignancies during the period 1996-2010. Parental socioprofessional category was recorded on the basis of ISCO68 and ISCO88 codes; the exact traveling distance between residence and the treating hospital was ad hoc calculated. Multivariate Cox's proportional hazards models were applied to examine the mutually adjusted associations between survival and potential predictors. Children from a lower parental socioprofessional category experienced 40% worse survival (P=0.02) independent of age, sex, and ALL subtype, whereas those whose parents were married had better outcomes (rate ratio: 0.47, P=0.01). Urbanization of residence at diagnosis or 'residence to treating hospital' distance was not nominally associated with survival from ALL. By contrast, no noteworthy associations implicating SES were found for AML survival, probably because of the burden of the disease and small numbers.

METHODS: A retrospective population-based cohort study of 5970 renal transplant recipients in Australia registered on the Australia and New Zealand Dialysis and Transplant Registry between 1982 and 1997 and followed until 2007. Data about the incidence of a range of cancer types from this Registry were compared with cancer incidence data for the general population matched for cancer type, year of incidence, age, and gender derived from national cancer records. Outcome measures for each cancer group with or without pretransplantation immunosuppression were cancer-specific standardized incidence ratios and a multivariate hazard ratio (HR) standardized to 1. RESULTS: For those treated with pretransplantation immunosuppression, the risks for four cancer groups during renal transplantation were significantly increased: anogenital cancer (HR, 3.13; confidence interval [CI], 1.92-5.11; P<0.0001), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (HR, 2.37; CI, 1.53-3.68; P=0.0001), breast cancer (HR, 2.52; CI, 1.13-5.61; P=0.024), and urinary tract cancer (excluding kidney) (HR, 1.84; CI, 1.13-3.01; P=0.015). However, the risks of cancer in the oral cavity and pharynx, kidney, thyroid, colon, leukemia, lung, melanoma, prostate, and stomach were not significantly increased.

In the present studies, the anti-allergic activities of emodin were investigated to elucidate the underlying active mechanisms. METHODS: The inhibitory effects of emodin on the IgE-mediated allergic response in rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) cells were evaluated by measuring the release of granules and cytokines. The Ca2+ mobilization in RBL-2H3 cells loaded with the Ca(2+)-reactive fluorescent probe Fluo-4 AM was also measured by laser scanning confocal microscope. RESULTS: Emodin inhibited the release of beta-hexosaminidase (beta-HEX; IC50 = 5.5 muM) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha (IC50 = 11.5 muM) from RBL-2H3 cells induced by 2,4-dinitrophenylated bovine serum albumin (DNP-BSA) and displayed stronger inhibition of beta-HEX release than ketotifen fumarate salt (IC50 = 63.8 muM). Emodin at a concentration of 12.5 muM also inhibited the DNP-BSA-induced influx of extracellular Ca2+ in RBL-2H3 cells.

This study demonstrates that chelidonine and an alkaloid extract from Chelidonium majus, which contains protoberberine and benzo[c]phenanthridine alkaloids, has the ability to overcome MDR of different cancer cell lines through interaction with ABC-transporters, CYP3A4 and GST, by induction of apoptosis, and cytotoxic effects. Chelidonine and the alkaloid extract inhibited P-gp/MDR1 activity in a concentration-dependent manner in Caco-2 and CEM/ADR5000 and reversed their doxorubicin resistance. In addition, chelidonine and the alkaloid extract inhibited the activity of the drug modifying enzymes CYP3A4 and GST in a dose-dependent manner. The alkaloids induced apoptosis in MDR cells which was accompanied by an activation of caspase-3, -8,-6/9, and phosphatidyl serine (PS) exposure. cDNA arrays were applied to identify differentially expressed genes after treatment with chelidonine and the alkaloid extract. The expression analysis identified a common set of regulated genes related to apoptosis, cell cycle, and drug metabolism. Treatment of Caco-2 cells with 50 mug/ml alkaloid extract and 50 muM chelidonine for up to 48 h resulted in a significant decrease in mRNA levels of P-gp/MDR1, MRP1, BCRP, CYP3A4, GST, and hPXR and in a significant increase in caspase-3 and caspase-8 mRNA. Thus, chelidonine is a promising model compound for overcoming MDR and for enhancing cytotoxicity of chemotherapeutics, especially against leukaemia cells.

Furthermore, the use of silhouette statistics, offering the advantages of measuring the classification quality by a graphical display and by an average silhouette width, has also demonstrated feasibility and novelty for more difficult multiclass tumor prediction problems.",['Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Comorbidities may be important, and previous studies have indicated elevated second cancer risk after initial primary thyroid cancers. This study examined the risk of second cancers after development of a thyroid cancer, primary utilizing the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program database. METHODS: The cohort consisted of men and women diagnosed with first primary thyroid cancer who were reported to a SEER database in 1973-2008 (n=52,103). Standardized incidence ratios (SIR) were calculated for all secondary cancers. Confidence intervals and p-values are at 0.05 significance alpha level and are two-sided based on Poisson exact methods. RESULTS: In this cohort, 4457 individuals developed second cancers. The risk of developing second cancers after a primary thyroid cancer varied from 10% to 150% depending on different cancer types. Cancers in all sites, breast, skin, prostate, kidney, brain, salivary gland, second thyroid, lymphoma, myeloma, and leukemia were elevated. The magnitude of the risk varied by histology, tumor size, calendar year of first primary thyroid cancer diagnosis, and the treatment of the primary thyroid cancer. The risk of a second cancer was elevated in patients whose first primary thyroid carcinomas were small, or were diagnosed after 1994, or in whom some form of radiation treatment was administered. CONCLUSIONS: This large population-based analysis of second cancers among thyroid cancer patients suggests that there was an increase of second cancers in all sites, and the most commonly elevated second cancers were the salivary gland and kidney. Additionally, the increase in second cancers in patients with recently diagnosed thyroid microcarcinomas (<10 mm) suggests that aggressive radiation treatment of the first primary thyroid cancer, the environment, and genetic susceptibility, may increase the risk of a second cancer.",,"['Kim, Christopher', 'Bi, Xiaofeng', 'Pan, Dongsheng', 'Chen, Yingtai', 'Carling, Tobias', 'Ma, Shuangge', 'Udelsman, Robert', 'Zhang, Yawei']","['Kim C', 'Bi X', 'Pan D', 'Chen Y', 'Carling T', 'Ma S', 'Udelsman R', 'Zhang Y']","['1 Yale School of Public Health, Yale University , New Haven, CT 06520, USA.']",['eng'],"['T32 CA105666/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HD70324-01/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', '1D43TW008323-01/TW/FIC NIH HHS/United States', 'CA105666/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K02 HD070324/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', '1D43TW007864-01/TW/FIC NIH HHS/United States', 'D43 TW007864/TW/FIC NIH HHS/United States', 'D43 TW008323/TW/FIC NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130418,United States,Thyroid,Thyroid : official journal of the American Thyroid Association,9104317,,IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Carcinoma/*pathology/radiotherapy/therapy', 'Cohort Studies', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Epidemiological Monitoring', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Kidney Neoplasms/epidemiology/etiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Registries', 'Risk', 'Salivary Gland Neoplasms/epidemiology/etiology', 'Thyroid Neoplasms/*pathology/radiotherapy/therapy', 'Tumor Burden', 'United States/epidemiology']",PMC3643257,,2012/12/15 06:00,2013/11/15 06:00,['2012/12/15 06:00'],"['2012/12/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/12/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/thy.2011.0406 [doi]'],ppublish,Thyroid. 2013 May;23(5):575-82. doi: 10.1089/thy.2011.0406.

Skin effects constitute the most common adverse effects of these new substances. Although such skin changes are not life-threatening, they can have extensive clinical impact, in some cases leading to discontinuation of treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A 47-year-old woman with no past medical history was followed for chronic phase CML since 26/11/2010 with the presence of the t(9; 22) karyotype. Imatinib (IM) was started at a dose of 400mg/day and haematological response was good. After 4 months of treatment with IM the patient presented with erythematous plaques on both upper limbs and on the oral and vaginal mucosa. These lesions disappeared after discontinuation of IM. The patient was then put on nilotinib 400mg/d and skin lesions reappeared after 3 weeks in the more serious form of erythema multiform with acral distribution, but with no involvement of the mucosa, resulting in immediate cessation of nilotinib. Skin biopsy was consistent with a drug-induced eruption. The lesions disappeared after discontinuation of nilotinib. DISCUSSION: In case of intolerance to IM, a second-generation ITK (dasatinib or nilotinib) may be substituted, and while cross-sensitivities seem infrequent, therapy is problematic in these patients presenting potentially curable blood dyscrasias.",['Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Moreover, TLS is seen with greater frequency in solid tumors, and particularly in bulky tumors with extensive metastases and tumors with organ or bone marrow involvement. The consequences of TLS include the serious morbidity and high risk of mortality associated with the condition itself. Additionally, TLS may delay or force an alteration in the patient's chemotherapy regimen. The changing patterns of TLS, as well as its frequency, in the clinical setting, result in unnecessarily high rates of illness and/or fatality.

Such chaperoning is essential for virus replication, notably for genomic RNA selection and packaging in virions, and for reverse transcription of genomic RNA into DNA. Recent data revealed that HIV-1 nucleocapsid restricts reverse transcription during virus assembly--a process called late reverse transcription--suggesting a regulation between RNA packaging and late reverse transcription. Indeed, mutating the HIV-1 nucleocapsid basic residues or the two zinc fingers caused a reduction in RNA incorporated and an increase in newly made viral DNA in the mutant virions. MoMuLV nucleocapsid has an N-terminal basic region similar to HIV-1 nucleocapsid but a unique zinc finger. This prompted us to investigate whether the N-terminal basic residues and the zinc finger of MoMuLV and HIV-1 nucleocapsids play a similar role in genomic RNA packaging and late reverse transcription. To this end, we analyzed the genomic RNA and viral DNA contents of virions produced by cells transfected with MoMuLV molecular clones where the zinc finger was mutated or completely deleted or with a deletion of the N-terminal basic residues of nucleocapsid. All mutant virions showed a strong defect in genomic RNA content indicating that the basic residues and zinc finger are important for genomic RNA packaging. In contrast to HIV-1 nucleocapsid-mutants, the level of viral DNA in mutant MoMuLV virions was only slightly increased. These results confirm that the N-terminal basic residues and zinc finger of MoMuLV nucleocapsid are critical for genomic RNA packaging but, in contrast to HIV-1 nucleocapsid, they most probably do not play a role in the control of late reverse transcription. In addition, these results suggest that virus formation and late reverse transcription proceed according to distinct mechanisms for MuLV and HIV-1.",,"['Chamontin, Celia', 'Yu, Bing', 'Racine, Pierre-Jean', 'Darlix, Jena-Luc', 'Mougel, Marylene']","['Chamontin C', 'Yu B', 'Racine PJ', 'Darlix JL', 'Mougel M']","['UMR5236 CNRS, UM1,UM2, CPBS, Montpellier, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121207,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Nucleocapsid Proteins)', '0 (Oligonucleotides)', '0 (RNA, Viral)']",IM,,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'HEK293 Cells', 'HIV-1/genetics/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics/*physiology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis', 'Nucleocapsid Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Oligonucleotides/genetics', 'RNA, Viral/*physiology', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcription/genetics/*physiology', 'Virus Assembly/*physiology', 'Zinc Fingers/genetics/physiology']",PMC3517543,,2012/12/14 06:00,2013/06/12 06:00,['2012/12/14 06:00'],"['2012/09/19 00:00 [received]', '2012/11/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/12/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/12/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/12 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0051534 [doi]', 'PONE-D-12-28381 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2012;7(12):e51534. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0051534.

Early-stage MDS (E-MDS) is characterized by autoimmune-mediated myelosuppression whereas late-stage MDS (L-MDS) involves immune evasion, giving dysplastic cells growth potential to progress into acute myeloid leukemia. T-helper (Th) 22 is involved in the pathogenesis of inflammatory autoimmunity and tumorigenesis. The roles of Th22 cells in the pathophysiology of E-MDS and L-MDS remain unsettled. DESIGN AND METHODS: We studied 37 MDS patients (E-MDS, n = 17; L-MDS, n = 20) and 20 healthy controls to characterize their peripheral blood (PB), as well as 25 MDS patients and 10 healthy controls to characterize their bone marrow(BM). The expression of Interleukin-22 (IL-22), IL-17 or interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) was examined in E-MDS, L-MDS patients and controls by flow cytometry. The mRNA expression levels of RAR-related orphan receptor C (RORC), IL-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and IL-23 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were determined by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The levels of IL-22 and IL-17 both in PB and BM plasma were examined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: In E-MDS, peripheral Th17 cells were significantly elevated and correlated with peripheral Th22 cells compared with healthy controls and L-MDS.

In particular, chemotherapeutic drug cocktails strain drug metabolizing enzymes especially the cytochrome P450 family (CYP). Furthermore, a number of important chemotherapeutic drugs such as cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, tamoxifen or procarbazine are administered as prodrugs and have to be activated by CYP. Therefore, the genetic variability of these enzymes should be taken into account to design appropriate therapeutic regimens to avoid inadequate drug administration, toxicity and inefficiency. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this work was to find drug interactions and to avoid side effects or ineffective therapy in chemotherapy. DATA SOURCES AND METHODS: Information on drug administration in the therapy of leukemia and their drug metabolism was collected from scientific literature and various web resources. We carried out an automated textmining approach. Abstracts of PubMed were filtered for relevant articles using specific keywords. Abstracts were automatically screened for antineoplastic drugs and their synonyms in combination with a set of human CYPs in title or abstract. RESULTS: We present a comprehensive analysis of over 100 common cancer treatment regimens regarding drug-drug interactions and present alternatives avoiding CYP overload.

Decreased miR-23a cluster expression in some acute leukemia cell lines was mediated by c-MYC.

Accumulating evidence has suggested that TNF-alpha negatively regulates embryonic and adult neurogenesis. However, the effect of TNF-alpha on cell fate decision in human neural progenitor cells (NPCs) has rarely been studied. Our previous studies have shown that recombinant TNF-alpha enhances astrogliogenesis and inhibits neurogenesis of human NPCs through the STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3) pathway. In the current study, we further elucidated the specific mechanism involved in TNF-alpha-induced astrogliogenesis. We found that TNF-alpha activated STAT3 at delayed time points (6 h and 24 h), whereas conditioned medium collected from TNF-alpha-treated NPCs induced an immediate STAT3 activation. These data suggest TNF-alpha plays an indirect role on STAT3 activation and the subsequent NPC differentiation. Further, we showed that TNF-alpha induced abundant amounts of the IL-6 family cytokines, including Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and Interleukin 6 (IL-6), in human NPCs. TNF-alpha-induced STAT3 phosphorylation and astrogliogenesis were abrogated by the addition of neutralizing antibody for LIF, but not for IL-6, revealing a critical role of autocrine secretion of LIF in TNF-alpha-induced STAT3 activation and astrogliogenesis.

In differentiating mouse ES cells and mouse yolk sac cultures, addition of Indian Hh ligand increased hematopoietic progenitors, whereas chemical inhibition of Hh signaling reduced hematopoietic progenitors without affecting primitive streak mesoderm formation. In the setting of Hh inhibition, induction of either Notch signaling or overexpression of Stem cell leukemia (Scl)/T-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia protein 1 rescued hemogenic vascular-endothelial cadherin(+) cells and hematopoietic progenitor formation.

However, due to the unknown pathogenicity of this novel retrovirus and its broad host range, including human cell lines, it is important to understand the modes of virus transmission and develop mitigation and management strategies to reduce the risk of human exposure and infection. XMRV transmission was evaluated by whole-blood transfusion in rhesus macaques. Monkeys were infected with XMRV to serve as donor monkeys for blood transfers at weeks 1, 2, and 3 into naive animals. The donor and recipient monkeys were evaluated for XMRV infection by nested PCR assays with nucleotide sequence confirmation, Western blot assays for development of virus-specific antibodies, and coculture of monkey peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with a sensitive target cell line for virus isolation. XMRV infection was demonstrated in the virus-injected donor monkeys, but there was no evidence of virus transmission by whole-blood transfusion to naive monkeys based upon PCR analysis of PBMCs using XMRV-specific gag and env primers, Western blot analysis of monkey plasma up to 31 to 32 weeks after transfusion, and coculture studies using monkey PBMCs from various times after transfusion. The study demonstrates the lack of XMRV transmission by whole-blood transfusion during the acute phase of infection. Furthermore, analysis of PBMC viral DNA showed extensive APOBEC-mediated G-to-A hypermutation in a donor animal at week 9, corroborating previous results using macaques and supporting the possible restriction of XMRV replication in humans by a similar mechanism.",,"['Williams, Dhanya K', 'Galvin, Teresa A', 'Gao, Yamei', ""O'Neill, Christina"", 'Glasner, Dustin', 'Khan, Arifa S']","['Williams DK', 'Galvin TA', 'Gao Y', ""O'Neill C"", 'Glasner D', 'Khan AS']","['Laboratory of Retroviruses, Division of Viral Products, Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20121212,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/blood', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Coculture Techniques', 'DNA, Viral/genetics/isolation & purification', '*Macaca mulatta', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Retroviridae Infections/*transmission', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', '*Transfusion Reaction', 'Xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus/genetics/*isolation & purification']",PMC3571456,,2012/12/14 06:00,2013/03/23 06:00,['2012/12/14 06:00'],"['2012/12/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/12/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/23 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.02326-12 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.02326-12 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2013 Feb;87(4):2278-86. doi: 10.1128/JVI.02326-12.

METHODS: Cancer death certifications (for 30 sites) and resident population estimates in 2008 stratified by sex and age were obtained from the World Health Organization (WHO) database (WHOSIS). Mortality rates were age-standardized on the world standard population. RESULTS: Cancer deaths registered in Italy in 2008 were 172,783 (97,773 men and 75,010 women), corresponding to age-standardized death rates of 144.1/100,000 men and 84.3/100,000 women. The projected cancer deaths in 2012 are 178,000 (100,000 men, 78,000 women) and the corresponding rates 132,5/100,000 men and 80.5/100,000 women. The favorable trend in lung cancer mortality among men was confirmed, with rates of 37.7/100,000 in 2008 (all ages) and 33.3 for 2012. Other tobacco-related cancers also declined in men but not in women, including pancreatic cancer, whose rates tended to level off over the last 3 years. The fall in female cancer mortality rates continues to be led by favorable trends in breast cancer (16.1/100,000 in 2007 and 15.2 in 2012), intestinal cancer, stomach cancer and uterine cancer. However, the female lung cancer mortality was still rising with 7743 deaths in 2008 (9.5/100,000), and lung cancer is predicted to become the second cause of female cancer mortality by 2012 (8,500 deaths, 9.8/100,000). CONCLUSIONS: Reduced tobacco and alcohol consumption are largely responsible for the favorable trends in cancer mortality in men. Advances in treatment and management accounted for the reduced mortality from colorectal cancer, breast cancer, leukemias and a few other cancers, as well as improved diagnosis for colorectal, cervical and breast cancer. The rising epidemic of tobacco-related deaths in women indicates the need for targeted tobacco-control strategies.",,"['Rosso, Tiziana', 'Malvezzi, Matteo', 'Bertuccio, Paola', 'Negri, Eva', 'La Vecchia, Carlo', 'Decarli, Adriano']","['Rosso T', 'Malvezzi M', 'Bertuccio P', 'Negri E', 'La Vecchia C', 'Decarli A']","['Istituto di Ricerche Farmacologiche Mario Negri, Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Tumori,Tumori,0111356,,IM,,"['Adult', 'Age Distribution', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Breast Neoplasms/mortality', 'Digestive System Neoplasms/mortality', 'Female', 'Forecasting', 'Genital Neoplasms, Female/mortality', 'Humans', 'Italy/epidemiology', 'Leukemia/mortality', 'Lung Neoplasms/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mortality/trends', 'Neoplasms/epidemiology/etiology/*mortality', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/mortality', 'Risk Reduction Behavior', 'Sex Distribution', 'Smoking Cessation', 'Survival Rate']",,,2012/12/14 06:00,2013/02/12 06:00,['2012/12/14 06:00'],"['2012/12/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/12/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1700/1190.13195 [doi]'],ppublish,Tumori. 2012 Sep-Oct;98(5):559-67. doi: 10.1700/1190.13195.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MLL-AF9-transduced single HSCs or GMPs could be continuously replated, but HSC-derived clones were more likely than GMP-derived clones to initiate AML in mice. Leukemia stem cells derived from either HSCs or GMPs had a similar immunophenotype consistent with a maturing myeloid cell (LGMP). Gene expression analyses demonstrated that LGMP inherited gene expression programs from the cell of origin including high-level Evi-1 expression in HSC-derived LGMP. The gene expression signature of LGMP derived from HSCs was enriched in poor prognosis human MLL-rearranged AML in three independent data sets. Moreover, global 5'-mC levels were elevated in HSC-derived leukemias as compared with GMP-derived leukemias. This mirrored a difference seen in 5'-mC between MLL-rearranged human leukemias that are either EVI1 positive or EVI1 negative. Finally, HSC-derived leukemias were more resistant to chemotherapy than GMP-derived leukemias.

Different studies, including phase I clinical trials, have indicated the potential therapeutic value of recombinant IL-7 in the context of anti-cancer immunotherapy and as a booster of immune reconstitution. However, the two main pathways activated by IL-7, JAK/STAT5 and PI3K/Akt/mTOR, have both been implicated in cancer and there is considerable evidence that IL-7 and its receptor (IL-7R), formed by IL-7Ralpha (encoded by IL7R) and gammac, may partake in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) development. In this context, the most compelling data comes from recent studies demonstrating that around 10% of T-ALL patients display IL7R gain-of-function mutations leading, in most cases, to disulfide bond-dependent homodimerization of two mutant receptors and consequent constitutive activation of downstream signaling, with ensuing cell transformation in vitro and tumorigenic ability in vivo. Here, we review the data on the involvement of IL-7 and IL-7R in T-ALL, further discussing the peculiarities of IL-7R-mediated signaling in human leukemia T-cells that may be of therapeutic value, namely regarding the potential use of PI3K and mTOR pharmacological inhibitors.",['Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

This study aimed to investigate the Ang II-induced expression of RhoGEFs in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) and to identify the possible regulator associated with hypertension. METHODS: Cultured VSMCs of the aorta from SHRs and Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats were treated with or without Ang II or Ang II plus Ang II type 2 receptor antagonists. The expression levels of RhoGEF messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein were determined. To evaluate the changes of aortic ring contractile force in response to Ang II, a nonviral carrier system was adopted to deliver the leukemia-associated RhoGEF (LARG) small interfering RNA via nanoparticles into aortic rings. RESULTS: The baseline mRNA levels of three RhoGEFs in cultured VSMCs of WKY rats did not increase with age, but they were significantly higher in 12-week-old SHRs than in 5-week-old SHRs. Expression levels of LARG mRNA were higher in SHRs than in age-matched WKY rats. The baseline LAGR protein of 12-week-old SHRs was about four times higher than that of WKY rats of the same age. After Ang II-stimulation, LAGR protein expression was significantly increased in 12-week-old WKY rats but remained unchanged in 12-week-old SHRs. LARG small interfering RNA was successfully delivered into aortic rings using nanoparticles. LARG knockdown resulted in 12-week-old SHRs showing the greatest reduction in aortic ring contraction. CONCLUSION: There were differences in age-related RhoGEF expression at baseline and in response to Ang II-stimulation between SHRs and WKY rats in this study. Nanotechnology can assist in studying the silencing of LARG in tissue culture. The findings of this study indicate that LARG gene expression may be associated with the genesis of hypertension in SHRs.",,"['Chiu, Wei-Chiao', 'Juang, Jyh-Ming', 'Chang, Shen-Nan', 'Wu, Cho-Kai', 'Tsai, Chia-Ti', 'Tseng, Chuen-den', 'Tseng, Yung-Zu', 'Su, Ming-Jai', 'Chiang, Fu-Tien']","['Chiu WC', 'Juang JM', 'Chang SN', 'Wu CK', 'Tsai CT', 'Tseng CD', 'Tseng YZ', 'Su MJ', 'Chiang FT']","['Graduate Institute of Physiology, National Taiwan University College of Medicine, No 7 Chung-Shan South Road, Taipei, Taiwan, Republic of China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121204,New Zealand,Int J Nanomedicine,International journal of nanomedicine,101263847,"['0 (Arhgef12 protein, rat)', '0 (Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors)', '0 (Rho Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors)', '11128-99-7 (Angiotensin II)']",IM,,"['Angiotensin II/*metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors/*metabolism', 'Hypertension/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Muscle, Smooth, Vascular/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Myocytes, Smooth Muscle/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred SHR', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Rho Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors']",PMC3518287,,2012/12/13 06:00,2013/04/09 06:00,['2012/12/13 06:00'],"['2012/12/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/12/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/09 06:00 [medline]']","['10.2147/IJN.S36700 [doi]', 'ijn-7-5929 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Nanomedicine. 2012;7:5929-39. doi: 10.2147/IJN.S36700.

Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG) and Cancer and Leukemia Group B compared the safety and efficacy of two immunochemotherapy regimens for FL in a phase III randomized intergroup protocol (SWOG S0016) that enrolled 554 patients with previously untreated, advanced-stage FL between March 1, 2001, and September 15, 2008. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were eligible for the study if they had advanced-stage (bulky stage II, III, or IV) evaluable FL of any grade (1, 2, or 3) and had not received previous therapy. In one arm of the study, patients received six cycles of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP) chemotherapy at 3-week intervals with six doses of rituximab (CHOP-R). In another arm of the study, patients received six cycles of CHOP followed by consolidation with tositumomab/iodine I-131 tositumomab radioimmunotherapy (RIT). RESULTS: After a median follow-up period of 4.9 years, the 2-year estimate of progression-free survival (PFS) was 76% on the CHOP-R arm and 80% on the CHOP-RIT arm (P = .11). The 2-year estimate of overall survival (OS) was 97% on the CHOP-R arm and 93% on the CHOP-RIT arm (P = .08). CONCLUSION: There was no evidence of a significant improvement in PFS comparing CHOP-RIT with CHOP-R. However, PFS and OS were outstanding on both arms of the study. Future studies are needed to determine the potential benefits of combining CHOP-R induction chemotherapy with RIT consolidation and/or extended rituximab maintenance therapy.",,"['Press, Oliver W',

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We examined patients enrolled onto successive first-line CALGB CLL trials to determine whether efficacy of regimens varied by age, focusing on ideal chemotherapy choice and benefit of immunotherapy addition to chemotherapy in older patients. Regimens included chlorambucil, fludarabine, fludarabine plus rituximab (FR), fludarabine with consolidation alemtuzumab, and FR with consolidation alemtuzumab. RESULTS: A total of 663 patients were evaluated for response, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) by age group. Interaction effects of fludarabine versus chlorambucil by age group (PFS, P = .046; OS, P = .006) showed that among patients younger than 70 years, PFS and OS was improved with fludarabine over chlorambucil (PFS: hazard ratio [HR] = 0.6, 95% CI, 0.5 to 0.8; OS: HR = 0.7, 95% CI, 0.5 to 0.9), but not in older adults (PFS, HR = 1.0, 95% CI, 0.6 to 1.7; OS: HR = 1.5, 95% CI, 0.9 to 2.3). In contrast, FR improved outcomes relative to fludarabine, irrespective of age (PFS: HR = 0.6, 95% CI, 0.4 to 0.7; OS: HR = 0.7, 95% CI, 0.5 to 0.9). Alemtuzumab consolidation did not provide benefit over similar regimens without alemtuzumab (P > .20), irrespective of age. CONCLUSION: These data support the use of chlorambucil as an acceptable treatment for many older patients with CLL and suggest rituximab is beneficial regardless of age.

We estimated methotrexate plasma clearance for 1279 patients with ALL treated with methotrexate (24-hour infusion of a 1 g/m2 dose or 4-hour infusion of a 2 g/m2 dose) on the Children's Oncology Group P9904 and P9905 protocols. Methotrexate clearance was lower in older children (P = 7 x 10(-7)), girls (P = 2.7 x 10(-4)), and those who received a delayed-intensification phase (P = .0022). A genome-wide analysis showed that methotrexate clearance was associated with polymorphisms in the organic anion transporter gene SLCO1B1 (P = 2.1 x 10(-11)).

To understand the clinical significance of this phenomenon, we enumerated hematogones in 108 consecutive patients who received allogeneic HSCT for the treatment of hematologic malignancies, including acute myelogenous leukemia, advanced myelodysplastic syndromes, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Hematogone quantitation was performed at the time of complete donor engraftment (median day 25 and 32 in patients who received bone marrow and cord blood cell transplants, respectively). Hematogones were polyclonal B cells, and their frequencies correlated positively with blood B-cell numbers, and inversely with donors' but not recipients' age, suggesting that hematogones reflect cell-intrinsic B-cell potential of donor cells. Interestingly, patients developing hematogones that comprised > 5% of bone marrow mononuclear cells constituted a group with significantly prolonged overall survival and relapse-free survival, irrespective of their primary disease or donor cell source. In addition, patients with > 5% hematogones developed severe acute graft-versus-host diseases less frequently, which may contribute toward their improved survival. We therefore conclude that the amount of hematogones at the time of engraftment may be a useful tool in predicting the prognosis of patients treated with allogeneic HSCT.

Minimal residual disease, which is present in most patients achieving complete remission with purine analogs, retains Ags that are ideal for targeted therapy. Rituximab, which targets CD20, is active as a single agent, particularly if combined with purine analogs. Recombinant immunotoxins targeting either CD25 or CD22 and containing truncated Pseudomonas exotoxin have achieved major responses in relapsed/refractory HCL. Moxetumomab pasudotox in phase 1 testing achieved responses in 86% of such patients (complete in 46%) without dose limiting toxicity and often without MRD. Soluble CD22 has been used for improved detection and monitoring of HCL, particularly the poor-prognosis variant that lacks CD25. Ig rearrangements unique for each HCL patient have been cloned, sequenced, and followed by real-time quantitative PCR using sequence-specific reagents. Analysis of these rearrangements has identified an unmutated IGVH4-34-expressing poor-prognosis variant with immunophenotypic characteristics of either classic or variant HCL. The BRAF V600E mutation, reported in 50% of melanomas, is present in > 85% of HCL cases that are both classic and express rearrangements other than IGVH4-34, making HCL a potential target for specific inhibitors of BRAF V600E.

This chapter focuses on the T-cell form of LGL leukemia. Clinical features include neutropenia, anemia, and rheumatoid arthritis. LGL leukemia is thought to arise from chronic antigenic stimulation, with the long-term survival of LGL being promoted by constitutive activation of multiple survival signaling pathways, such as the JAK/STAT3, sphingolipid, and Ras/MEK/ERK pathways. Therefore, these lead to global deregulation of apoptosis and resistance to normal pathways of activation-induced cell death. The majority of LGL leukemia patients eventually need treatment. Treatment of leukemic LGL is based on immunosuppressive therapy, primarily using low doses of methotrexate or cyclophosphamide. However, no standard therapy has been established because of the lack of large, prospective trials. In addition, because some patients are refractory to currently available treatments and none of these therapeutic modalities can cure LGL leukemia, new therapeutic options are needed.

In B-PLL, rituximab-based combination chemoimmunotherapy is effective in fitter patients. TP53 abnormalities are common and, as for chronic lymphocytic leukemia, these patients should generally be managed using an alemtuzumab-based therapy. Currently, the best treatment for T-PLL is IV alemtuzumab, which has resulted in very high response rates of more than 90% when given as frontline treatment and a significant improvement in survival. Consolidation of remissions with autologous or allogeneic stem cell transplantation further prolongs survival times, and the latter may offer potential cure.

Distinguishing malignant from benign leukocytosis is a critical step in the care of a patient, which initiates a vastly different decision tree. Confirmation of the complete blood cell count and the WBC differential is the first step. Examination of the PB smear is essential to confirming the automated blood cell differential or affirming the manual differential performed on the PB smear. Next is separation of the leukocytosis into a myeloid versus a lymphoid process. Distinguishing a reactive lymphoid proliferation from a lymphoproliferative disorder requires examination of lymphocyte morphology for pleomorphic lymphocytes versus a monomorphic population, with the latter favoring a lymphoproliferative neoplasm. Samples suspicious for lymphoproliferative disorders can be confirmed and characterized by flow cytometry, with molecular studies initiated in select cases; precursor lymphoid neoplasms (lymphoblasts) should trigger a BM examination. Myeloid leukocytosis triggers a differential diagnosis of myeloid leukemoid reactions versus myeloid malignancies. The manual differential is key, along with correct enumeration of blasts and blast equivalents, immature granulocytes, basophils, and eosinophils and identifying dysplasia to identify myeloid malignancies. Confirmation and characterization of myeloid malignancies should be performed with a BM examination and the appropriate ancillary studies.

Recent years have seen a shift from microarray analysis and candidate gene sequencing to next-generation sequencing. Together, these approaches have shown that many ALL subtypes are characterized by constellations of structural rearrangements, submicroscopic DNA copy number alterations, and sequence mutations, several of which have clear implications for risk stratification and targeted therapeutic intervention. Mutations in genes regulating lymphoid development are a hallmark of ALL, and alterations of the lymphoid transcription factor gene IKZF1 (IKAROS) are associated with a high risk of treatment failure in B-ALL. Approximately 20% of B-ALL cases harbor genetic alterations that activate kinase signaling that may be amenable to treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors, including rearrangements of the cytokine receptor gene CRLF2; rearrangements of ABL1, JAK2, and PDGFRB; and mutations of JAK1 and JAK2. Whole-genome sequencing has also identified novel targets of mutation in aggressive T-lineage ALL, including hematopoietic regulators (ETV6 and RUNX1), tyrosine kinases, and epigenetic regulators.

Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) has occupied an increasing therapeutic role as a result of significant improvements in supportive care and histocompatibility testing. ALL Philadelphia chromosome-negative patients formerly excluded now are considered HCT candidates and survival rates with alternative donors may approach those obtained with matched-related donors. Reduced-intensity conditioning rather than myeloablative conditioning appears to provide comparable patient outcome results although these observations have not been validated in prospective studies.

At the same time, our understanding of MM biology and the molecular mechanisms driving the disease is constantly improving. Next-generation sequencing technologies now allow insights into the genetic aberrations in MM at a genome-wide scale and across different developmental stages in the course of an individual tumor. This improved knowledge about MM biology needs to be rapidly translated and transformed into diagnostic and therapeutic applications to finally achieve cure in a larger proportion of patients. As a part of these translational efforts, novel drugs that inhibit oncogenic proteins overexpressed in defined molecular subgroups of the disease, such as FGFR3 and MMSET in t(4;14) MM, are currently being developed. The potential of targeted next-generation diagnostic tests to rapidly identify clinically relevant molecular subgroups is being evaluated. The technical tools to detect and define tumor subclones may potentially become clinically relevant because intraclonal tumor heterogeneity has become apparent in many cancers. The emergence of different MM subclones under the selective pressure of treatment is important in MM, especially in the context of maintenance therapy and treatment for asymptomatic stages of the disease. Finally, novel diagnostic and therapeutic achievements have to be implemented into innovative clinical trial strategies with smaller trials for molecularly defined high-risk patients and large trials with a long follow-up for the patients most profiting from the current treatment protocols. These combined approaches will hopefully transform the current one-for-all care into a more tailored, individual therapeutic strategy for MM patients.",,"['Morgan, Gareth J', 'Kaiser, Martin F']","['Morgan GJ', 'Kaiser MF']","['Institute of Cancer Research and Royal Marsden Hospital, London, United Kingdom. gareth.morgan@icr.ac.uk']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Hematology Am Soc Hematol Educ Program,Hematology.

Acute neutropenia is a relatively frequent finding, whereas disorders of production of neutrophils are quite rare. Acute neutropenia is often well tolerated and normalizes rapidly. Neutropenia arising as a result of underlying hematologic disorders is far more significant. Such a patient may be at risk for infectious complications and will likely require a thorough investigation. Acute neutropenia evolves over a few days and occurs when neutrophil use is rapid and production is impaired. Chronic neutropenia may last for 3 months or longer and is a result of reduced production, increased destruction, or excessive splenic sequestration of neutrophils. Neutropenia may be classified by whether it arises secondarily to causes extrinsic to BM myeloid cells, which is common; as an acquired disorder of myeloid progenitor cells, which is less frequent; or as an intrinsic defect arising from impaired proliferation and maturation of myeloid progenitor cells in the BM, which is rare. Severe neutropenia with absolute neutrophil counts below 500/muL increases susceptibility to bacterial or fungal infections. Multiple disorders of severe congenital neutropenia have been found by the discovery of genetic defects affecting differentiation, adhesion, and apoptosis of neutrophil precursors.

Unfortunately, with the exception of chronic myelogenous leukemia and EBV-induced lymphoproliferative disease, allo-HSCT GVL lacks the potency to significantly affect disease progression or recurrence in most other hematologic malignancies. The inadequacy of a GVL effect using past approaches is particularly evident in patients with lymphoid malignancies. However, with the advent of improved gene transfer technology, genetically modified tumor-specific immune effectors have extended cellular immunotherapy to lymphoid malignancies. One promising strategy entails the introduction of genes encoding artificial receptors called chimeric antigen receptors (CARs), which redirect the specificity and function of immune effectors. CAR-modified T cells targeted to the B cell-specific CD19 antigen have demonstrated promising results in multiple early clinical trials, supporting further investigation in patients with B-cell cancers. However, disparities in clinical trial design and CAR structure have complicated the discovery of the optimal application of this technology.

It will allow the initiation of timely therapeutic intervention for patients with a suboptimal response or kinase inhibitor therapy failure. Evidence is mounting that reaching molecular targets early in therapy is as important as the initial hematologic and cytogenetic response for the identification of patients who may have a poorer outcome. When the molecular target of a major molecular response is achieved at 18 months, patients reach a safe haven where loss of response is rare. However, this benefit is dependent on continuous drug adherence in most patients. As some patients reach their second decade of successful imatinib therapy, how long will frequent response monitoring be necessary? Assuming that very late relapse will be extremely rare for responding patients remaining on kinase inhibitor therapy, there are reasons for maintaining a regular molecular monitoring frequency, including monitoring adherence assessment and confirming sustained undetectable BCR-ABL1 for those considering a discontinuation trial and for late molecular recurrence in patients who maintain response after treatment discontinuation.",,"['Branford, Susan']",['Branford S'],"['Department of Genetics and Molecular Pathology, Centre for Cancer Biology, SA Pathology, Adelaide, Australia. susan.branford@health.sa.gov.au']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Hematology Am Soc Hematol Educ Program,Hematology.

A molecular eradication of the leukemia has become not only a desirable, but also an achievable, end point that needs to be evaluated within clinical trials. The assessment of complete remission only at the clinical and morphological level is insufficient, at least for physically fit patients. The detection of minimal residual disease (MRD) in chronic lymphocytic leukemia has become feasible using PCR-based or flow cytometric techniques that reproducibly allow reaching the detection level of less than 1 leukemic cell per 10 000 leukocytes (10(-4)), the level currently defined as MRD(-) status. Emerging data indicate that the MRD status during and at the end of treatment is one of the most powerful predictors of progression-free and overall survival. This predictor appears to be independent of clinical response, type or line of therapy, and known biological markers. For these reasons, the time is ripe to test the use of MRD as a surrogate marker of clinical end points and as a real-time marker of efficacy and/or resistance to the administered therapies. In the near future, clinical trials will determine whether MRD assessment can be used for guiding therapy, either to improve quality of responses through consolidation or to prevent relapses through preemptive therapies based on the reappearance of MRD.",,"['Ghia, Paolo']",['Ghia P'],"['Universita Vita-Salute San Raffaele, Milano, Italy. ghia.paolo@hsr.it']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Hematology Am Soc Hematol Educ Program,Hematology.

In vitro, CLL cells rapidly undergo apoptosis unless microenvironmental factors are provided that support their survival. Signaling pathways activated in the microenvironment in vivo include the B-cell receptor (BCR) and NF-kappaB pathways. Thus, CLL is a disease ""addicted to the host"" and is dependent on pathways that promote normal B-cell development, expansion, and survival; this is particularly true in the case of the BCR signaling cascade. Small-molecule inhibitors of kinases that are essential for BCR signal transduction abrogate the stimulating effects of the microenvironment on CLL cells. The orally administered tyrosine kinase inhibitors fostamatinib and ibrutinib and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor GS-1101 have induced impressive responses in relapsed and refractory CLL patients, mostly with moderate side effects. Reductions in lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly are seen within weeks and are frequently accompanied by a transient rise in absolute lymphocyte count that is asymptomatic and probably the result of changes in CLL cell trafficking.

This chapter attempts to define biologic and molecular underpinnings of 3 sets of prognostic indicators in CLL: genetic abnormalities quantified by FISH and/or defined by exploratory sensitive molecular techniques, expression of specific proteins in or on CLL cells (ie, CD38, CD49d, and ZAP-70), and the IGHV mutation status of a CLL clone. Although not demonstrated conclusively, each probably reflects the biologic properties of the leukemic cells of individual CLL patients. This reflection may be direct, indicating a specific property of the CLL cell itself, or indirect, representing how the CLL cell interacts with the host's microenvironment. The new tyrosine kinase inhibitors that are currently in clinical trials support this interpretation. These and other biology-based indicators of patient clinical course and outcome can be used as starting points from which to understand and treat CLL.",,"['Chiorazzi, Nicholas']",['Chiorazzi N'],"['The Karches Center for Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Research, The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, Manhasset, NY, USA.

The conventional definition of CR, based on the morphologic recognition of </= 5% of leukemic blasts in the BM, does not provide sufficient insight into the quality of the response. Despite CR rates of 50%-80% (depending on age), the majority of patients with AML relapse within 3-5 years from diagnosis. Therefore, there is great need of more sensitive prognostic factors that can predict relapse. Minimal residual disease (MRD), defined as any measurable disease or leukemia detectable above a certain threshold (defined by the methodology applied), predicts failure to maintain a morphologic CR and affects survival negatively. AML is lagging behind acute lymphoblastic leukemia with respect to the implementation of MRD criteria for guidance during therapy. AML is particularly disadvantaged compared with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in that approximately half of AML patients lack a molecular target suitable for MRD monitoring. The detection of altered antigen (Ag) expression by leukemic myeloblasts is a valid alternative to DNA- or RNA-based MRD assays. Although associated with presenting prognostic factors (eg, cytogenetics and genotype), MRD represents the collective end result of all of the cellular mechanisms that determine a patient's response to a given therapy. Therefore, MRD has 2 potential roles in AML treatment: (1) as a posttherapy prognosticator used to assign patients to optimal postinduction/consolidation therapy, and (2) as an early surrogate end point for the evaluation of therapy efficacy.",,"['Paietta, Elisabeth']",['Paietta E'],"['Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY, USA. epaietta@earthlink.net']",['eng'],"['CA021115/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA114737/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",,United States,Hematology Am Soc Hematol Educ Program,Hematology.

There is a possibility that improving the quality of remission can reduce the risk of relapse. Escalation of daunorubicin dose, addition of Ab-directed chemotherapy, and alternative nucleoside analogs in induction may displace the longstanding standard of ""3 + 7"" daunorubicin + cytarabine (Ara-C) as induction, and several prognostic factors are emerging that enable a more personalized approach to postinduction treatment, in particular, which patients should be offered allogeneic transplantation in first remission. In addition to providing prognostic information, molecular characterization provides potential therapeutic targets and, in some cases, an opportunity to more precisely monitor residual disease. With few exceptions, the predictive value of prognostic factors (ie, what therapy to adopt) has yet to be established. A major challenge is the treatment of older patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), who represent the majority of patients with this disease. Only about half of older AML patients will enter complete remission (CR) with conventional chemotherapy and, of these, most will relapse within 2 years. Little impact has been made on these dismal outcomes over the past 3 decades, and new treatments and approaches to trial design are required. Another population of concern is older AML patients who are not considered to be fit for an intensive approach based on concerns about their ability to withstand the consequences of treatment. This group is not easy to define objectively, but age represents a useful surrogate because it is associated with more chemoresistant disease and medical comorbidity.

Further validation by flow cytometry and functional studies indicated that long-term self-renewing leukemic stem cells reside within the CD34(+)/ITGA6(+) fraction, at least in a subset of AML cases. Furthermore, we combined proteomics with transcriptomics approaches using a large panel of AML CD34(+) (n = 60) and normal bone marrow CD34(+) (n = 40) samples.

PECAM-1 has been shown to play roles in regulation of adhesion, migration and apoptosis. The BCR/ABL fusion tyrosine kinase is expressed in chronic myeloid leukemia and Philadelphia-positive (Ph+) acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells, and its inhibition by the clinically used tyrosine kinase inhibitors imatinib or dasatinib induces apoptosis of these cells. In the present study, we demonstrate that PECAM-1 is tyrosine phospho-rylated in its ITIM motifs in various BCR/ABL-expressing cells including primary leukemia cells. Studies using imatinib and dasatinib as well as transient expression experiments in 293T cells revealed that PECAM-1 was phosphorylated directly by BCR/ABL, which was enhanced by the imatinib-resistant E255K and T315I mutations, or partly by the Src family tyrosine kinases, including Lyn, which were activated dependently or independently on BCR/ABL. We also demonstrate by using a substrate trapping mutant of SHP2 that tyrosine phosphorylated PECAM-1 binds SHP2 and is a major substrate for this tyrosine phosphatase in BCR/ABL-expressing cells. Overexpression of PECAM-1 in BCR/ABL-expressing cells, including K562 human leukemia cells, enhanced cell adhesion and partially inhibited imatinib-induced apoptosis involving mitochondria depolarization and caspase-3 cleavage, at least partly, in an ITIM-independent manner. These data suggest that PECAM-1 may play a role in regulation of apoptosis as well as adhesion of BCR/ABL-expressing cells to modulate their imatinib sensitivity and would be a possible candidate for therapeutic target in Ph+ leukemias.",,"['Wu, Nan', 'Kurosu, Tetsuya', 'Oshikawa, Gaku', 'Nagao, Toshikage', 'Miura, Osamu']","['Wu N', 'Kurosu T', 'Oshikawa G', 'Nagao T', 'Miura O']","['Department of Hematology, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Bunkyoku, Tokyo 113-8519, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121206,Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Platelet Endothelial Cell Adhesion Molecule-1)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzamides/*pharmacology', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects/genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Platelet Endothelial Cell Adhesion Molecule-1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects']",PMC3583636,,2012/12/13 06:00,2014/01/08 06:00,['2012/12/13 06:00'],"['2012/09/28 00:00 [received]', '2012/11/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/12/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/12/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/ijo.2012.1729 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2013 Feb;42(2):419-28. doi: 10.3892/ijo.2012.1729.

In our study, two CML cell lines (K562, KU812) had higher gamma-catenin expression levels compared to five types of BCR-ABL-negative leukemia cells. Knockdown of the expression of BCR-ABL resulted in downregulation of gamma-catenin. Furthermore, downregulation of gamma-catenin by siRNA inhibited the proliferation and colony formation of CML cells and the expression of the c-Myc and cyclin D1 genes; downregulation of gamma-catenin also potentiated the effects of imatinib (inhibiting CML cell proliferation and inducing apoptosis) and suppressed the anti-apoptotic genes Bcl-xL and survivin.

In order to analyze the prognostic importance of MSI2 and NUMB expression in AML, MSI2 and NUMB transcript levels from 454 AML patients treated in multicenter trials AML SHG 0199 (ClinicalTrials Identifier NCT00209833) and 0295, and 38 healthy volunteers were analyzed by reverse transcriptase PCR in the context of other molecular markers (NPM1, FLT3, CEBPA, IDH1/IDH2, DNMT3A, NRAS, WT1, KIT, MN1, BAALC, ERG, and WT1). In AML, patients with high MSI2 expression were more likely to be FLT3-ITD positive (P < .001), NPM1 (P < .001), and DNMT3A (P = .003) mutated. Overall survival (OS) was shorter in AML patients with high MSI2 expression (hazard ratio, 1.48; 95 % confidence interval, 1.13-1.95, P = .005). However, relapse-free survival (RFS, P = .15) and complete remission (CR, P = .39) rates were not influenced by MSI2 expression. In multivariate analysis, MSI2 expression remained an independent prognostic factor for OS (P = .03). NUMB expression had no impact on survival (OS, P = .47; RFS, P = .59) and CR rate (P = .39). MSI2 but not NUMB is associated with shorter OS in AML patients and may indicate a more aggressive form of AML.",,"['Thol, Felicitas', 'Winschel, Claudia', 'Sonntag, Ann-Kathrin', 'Damm, Frederik', 'Wagner, Katharina', 'Chaturvedi, Anuhar', 'Gohring, Gudrun', 'Schlegelberger, Brigitte', 'Lubbert, Michael', 'Fiedler, Walter', 'Kirchner, Hartmut', 'Krauter, Jurgen', 'Ganser, Arnold', 'Heuser, Michael']","['Thol F', 'Winschel C', 'Sonntag AK', 'Damm F', 'Wagner K', 'Chaturvedi A', 'Gohring G', 'Schlegelberger B', 'Lubbert M', 'Fiedler W', 'Kirchner H', 'Krauter J', 'Ganser A', 'Heuser M']","['Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology, and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Carl-Neuberg Str. 1, 30625, Hannover, Germany. thol.felicitas@mh-hannover.de']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121212,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (MSI2 protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Numb protein, human)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/*metabolism/mortality', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Middle Aged', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Prognosis', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Survival Rate/trends', 'Young Adult']",,,2012/12/13 06:00,2013/03/30 06:00,['2012/12/13 06:00'],"['2012/11/10 00:00 [received]', '2012/11/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/12/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/12/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00277-012-1637-5 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2013 Mar;92(3):315-23. doi: 10.1007/s00277-012-1637-5.

To determine whether dietary curcumin can enhance the efficacy of a conventional chemotherapeutic agent, vincristine was injected intraperitoneally into leukemic mice fed the different diets. Dietary curcumin did not delay the engraftment or growth of leukemia cells, or sensitize the cells to vincristine. Liquid chromatographytandem mass spectrometry analyses of mouse sera showed that curcumin rapidly metabolized to glucuronidated and sulfated forms within 1 h postinjection and these were the major curcumin metabolites found in the sera of the mice fed the curcumin diet.

Mutant IDH enzyme loses its normal activity to convert isocitrate into alpha-ketoglutarate (alphaKG) and instead acquires the ability to reduce alphaKG to D-2-hydroxyglutarate. Through direct competition with alphaKG, accumulation of the oncometabolite D-2-hydroxyglutarate in IDH mutated tumors results in inhibition of alphaKG-dependent dioxygenases involved in DNA and histone demethylation. Apart from epigenetic alterations, perturbations in the tricarboxylic acid cycle (depletion of intermediates) and activation of the intricately linked hypoxia signaling pathway are apparent in IDH mutated cells. As molecular details are being unraveled, the emerging concept is that IDH mutations result in tumor formation by epigenetic alterations that affect gene expression and result in inhibition of cellular differentiation.

These processes are regulated by Ca(2+) signals arising from the endoplasmic reticulum, which at distinct sites is in close proximity to the mitochondria. These organelles are linked by different mechanisms, including Ca(2+)-transport mechanisms involving the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R) and the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC). The amount of Ca(2+) transfer from the endoplasmic reticulum to mitochondria determines the susceptibility of cells to apoptotic stimuli. Suppressing the transfer of Ca(2+) from the endoplasmic reticulum to the mitochondria increases the apoptotic resistance of cells and may decrease the cellular responsiveness to apoptotic signaling in response to cellular damage or alterations. This can result in the survival, growth and proliferation of cells with oncogenic features. Clearly, proper maintenance of endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) homeostasis and dynamics including its links with the mitochondrial network is essential to detect and eliminate altered cells with oncogenic features through the apoptotic pathway. Proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressors exploit the central role of Ca(2+) signaling by targeting the IP3R. There are an increasing number of reports showing that activation of proto-oncogenes or inactivation of tumor suppressors directly affects IP3R function and endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) homeostasis, thereby decreasing mitochondrial Ca(2+) uptake and mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization. In this review, we provide an overview of the current knowledge on the proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressors identified as IP3R-regulatory proteins and how they affect endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) homeostasis and dynamics.",['Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Thermal denaturation analyses show that the N-terminal domain is endowed with an exceptional thermal stability, as it does not unfold in the investigated temperature range (20-105 degrees C). This finding is corroborated by chemical denaturation experiments showing that this domain is not significantly affected by the addition of 8M urea. These results are consistent with the chaperone function of NPM1. In line with literature data, the other folded domain of the NPM1, a 3-helix bundle domain located at the C-terminus, shows a lower stability. Interestingly, the chemical and thermal stability of this latter domain, which embeds natural mutations related to acute myeloid leukemia, is influenced by the presence of other regions of the protein.

Besides, the proliferation and Th1 cytokines productions (e.g. IFN-gamma, IL-2 and IL-12) were suppressed in bigelovin-treated PBMCs. On the other hand, bigelovin was shown to significantly inhibit the human monocyte adhesion to human endothelial cells and the gene expressions of inflammation-related CAMs (e.g. ICAM-1, VCAM-1 and E-selectin) were significantly down-regulated in bigelovin-treated human endothelial cells. In summary, our data provide the first evidence that bigelovin possesses anti-angiogenic and immunomodulatory activities, suggesting bigelovin may exert multi-target functions against cancer in animal models.",['Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Sensitivity to sorafenib was analyzed in MCL cell lines and primary samples in the context of BCR and microenvironment simulation. Sorafenib signaling was characterized by quantitative PCR, Western blotting, immunofluorescence, and protein immunoprecipitation. Migration analysis included flow cytometric counting, actin polymerization assays, and siRNA-mediated knockdown of focal adhesion kinase (FAK). In vivo antitumor effect of sorafenib and bortezomib was analyzed in an MCL xenograft mouse model. RESULTS: Sorafenib rapidly dephosphorylates the BCR-associated kinases, Syk and Lyn, as well as FAK, an Src target involved in focal adhesion. In this line, sorafenib displays strong synergy with the Syk inhibitor, R406. Sorafenib also blocks Mcl-1 and cyclin D1 translation, which promotes an imbalance between pro- and antiapoptotic proteins and facilitates Bax release from cyclin D1, leading to the induction of mitochondrial apoptosis and caspase-dependent and -independent mechanisms. Moreover, sorafenib inhibits MCL cell migration and CXCL12-induced actin polymerization. FAK knockdown partially prevents this inhibitory effect, indicating that FAK is a relevant target of sorafenib. Furthermore, sorafenib enhances the antitumoral activity of bortezomib in an MCL xenograft mouse model as well as overcomes stroma-mediated bortezomib resistance in MCL cells. CONCLUSION: We show for the first time that sorafenib interferes with BCR signaling, protein translation and modulates the microenvironment prosurvival signals in MCL, suggesting that sorafenib, alone or in combination with bortezomib, may represent a promising approach to treat patients with MCL.",,"['Xargay-Torrent, Silvia', 'Lopez-Guerra, Monica', 'Montraveta, Arnau', 'Saborit-Villarroya, Ifigenia', 'Rosich, Laia', 'Navarro, Alba', 'Perez-Galan, Patricia', 'Roue, Gael', 'Campo, Elias', 'Colomer, Dolors']","['Xargay-Torrent S', 'Lopez-Guerra M', 'Montraveta A', 'Saborit-Villarroya I', 'Rosich L', 'Navarro A', 'Perez-Galan P', 'Roue G', 'Campo E', 'Colomer D']","[""Hematopathology Unit, Department of Pathology, Hospital Clinic, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121211,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL12)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Phenylurea Compounds)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)', '25X51I8RD4 (Niacinamide)', '9ZOQ3TZI87 (Sorafenib)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,,"['Actins/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement/*drug effects', 'Chemokine CXCL12/metabolism', 'Cyclin D1/genetics', 'Disease Models, Animal', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Niacinamide/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Phenylurea Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Protein Biosynthesis/*drug effects', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Protein Multimerization', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Sorafenib', 'Stromal Cells', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']",,,2012/12/13 06:00,2013/07/17 06:00,['2012/12/13 06:00'],"['2012/12/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/12/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/17 06:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-12-1935 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-12-1935 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2013 Feb 1;19(3):586-97. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-12-1935.

Steroid-refractory GvHD has a poor outcome. Although there are a variety of new approaches to the treatment of refractory GvHD, many have limited evidence of efficacy. Other approaches appear to be unacceptably toxic. It would be preferable to improve GvHD prophylaxis. There is good evidence that rates of GvHD can be reduced without unacceptable reduction of the graft-versus-leukemia effect or compromising overall survival. However, prophylactic measures aimed at reducing T-cell numbers or functions are associated with high rates of reactivation of latent viruses.

METHODS: RT-PCR was used to examine MDR1 mRNA levels, cytotoxic effects of imatinib (IM), daunorubicin (DNR), vincristine (VCR), etoposide (VP-16) and the synergetic antiproliferation with P-gp inhibitor verapamil on sensitive SUP-B15 and SUP-B15/RI cell lines were detected by the MTT assay. The P-gp function was measured by flow cytometry. RESULTS: Increased expression of MDR1 gene in SUP-B15/RI than that of SUP-B15 cell line (P < 0.05) was observed when detected with RT-PCR. The IC50 values of SUP-B15/RI cell line inhibited by IM, DNR, VCR, VP-16 for 72 hours was higher than that of SUP-B15 (P < 0.05) and the resistant factor (RF) was (20.52 +/- 2.34), (10.33 +/- 1.88), (9.78 +/- 1.27), (3.84 +/- 0.69) respectively.

The activity of P-gp in SUP-B15/RI measured by flow cytometry was higher than that of P-gp in SUP-B15/RI cell line. CONCLUSION: The overexpression of MDR1 mRNA and higher activity of P-gp is partially responsible for acquiring of imatinib resistance in SUP-B15/RI cell line.

Colchicine 0.6 mg orally daily was initiated in March for the prophylaxis of pseudogout. His WBC count decreased, and his colchicine dosage was reduced to 0.6 mg every other day. Despite this decreased dosage, his WBC count and ANC were 600 and 100 cells/muL, respectively, in September. In October, the patient received chemotherapy for presumed worsening of his CLL. One month later, his WBC count and ANC were 400 and 200 cells/muL, respectively. Subcutaneous filgrastim was administered, and colchicine was discontinued. At the end of November, he received another cycle of chemotherapy followed by pegfilgrastim. On the day of pegfilgrastim administration, the patient's WBC count and ANC were 2000 and 1300 cells/muL, respectively. Two weeks later, his WBC count was 8800 cells/muL, and his ANC was 8300 cells/muL. Daily colchicine was restarted at the end of December. Two months later, his WBC count and ANC were 800 and 500 cells/muL, respectively. Given the symptomatic relief with colchicine, therapy was continued with close monitoring. CONCLUSION: A patient with CLL developed leukopenia in association with colchicine administration for pseudogout.",,"['Beggs, Ashton E', 'Reeves, David J', 'Noel, Nancy S']","['Beggs AE', 'Reeves DJ', 'Noel NS']","['Department ofPharmacy Practice, College of Pharmacy, Belmont University, Nashville, TN 37212, USA. ashton.beggs@belmont.edu']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,England,Am J Health Syst Pharm,American journal of health-system pharmacy : AJHP : official journal of the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists,9503023,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Gout Suppressants)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'PVI5M0M1GW (Filgrastim)', 'SML2Y3J35T (Colchicine)', 'Chondrocalcinosis 2']",IM,,"['Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Chondrocalcinosis/drug therapy', 'Colchicine/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Filgrastim', 'Gout Suppressants/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukopenia/*chemically induced', 'Male', 'Recombinant Proteins/therapeutic use']",,,2012/12/12 06:00,2013/05/23 06:00,['2012/12/12 06:00'],"['2012/12/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/12/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/23 06:00 [medline]']","['69/24/2147 [pii]', '10.2146/ajhp120330 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Health Syst Pharm. 2012 Dec 15;69(24):2147-8. doi: 10.2146/ajhp120330.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we investigated the anticancer responses and immune activities in implanted tumor cells. Our study found that ar-turmerone inhibited the increase in the number of white blood cells, which normally increase by the injection of lymphoblast cells, or P388D1, and ar-turmerone increased lymphocyte percentage compared to the control. Tumor inhibition rate in the ar-turmerone-treated group was 11.79%, and the apoptosis indexes of the control, ar-turmerone and Glivec groups were 4.22+/-1.02, 5.45+/-1.46 and 10.01+/-2.01, respectively, in which only the Glivec-treated group showed a significance. The positive rates of Bcl-2 and Bax proteins which were treated by ar-turmerone did not show marked differences compared to the control group, but the Bax protein in the Glivec-treated group increased compared to the control group. The density of caspase-1, -3, -6, -9, Bcl-2, Bax, p21 and p53 mRNA in the control, ar-turmerone and Glivec groups did not change considerably, but the Bax mRNA of the Glivec-treated group increased compared to the control group. The ar-turmerone-treated group increased T-lymphocyte and B-lymphocyte proliferation activities compared to the control group, which was more significant in T-lymphocyte than in B-lymphocyte proliferation activity. The interleukin-2 (IL2) production activity of the ar-turmerone group increased compared to the control group. These findings suggest that ar-turmerone does not have a chemotherapeutic effect on tumor incidence, but it has a repressive effect on P388D1 lymphocytic leukemia. Furthermore, this protective effect of ar-turmerone from P388D1 lymphocytic leukemia resulted from the increased activity of tumor immunogenicity through increased T-lymphokine production and increased percentage of lymphocytes.",,"['Kim, Donghee', 'Suh, Yongjun', 'Lee, Hyunsook', 'Lee, Yongkyu']","['Kim D', 'Suh Y', 'Lee H', 'Lee Y']","['Research and Development Center, Daewoo Pharm.

It is unclear whether this characteristic can be more universally applied to patients from non-'high-risk' sub-groups and across a broad range of cellular immunophenotypes. Here, we demonstrate in a wide range of primary patient samples and patient samples previously passaged through mice that leukaemia-propagating cells are found in all populations defined by high or low expression of the lymphoid differentiation markers CD10, CD20 or CD34. The frequency of leukaemia-propagating cells and their engraftment kinetics do not differ between these populations. Transcriptomic analysis of CD34(high) and CD34(low) blasts establishes their difference and their similarity to comparable normal progenitors at different stages of B-cell development. However, consistent with the functional similarity of these populations, expression signatures characteristic of leukaemia propagating cells in acute myeloid leukaemia fail to distinguish between the different populations. Together, these findings suggest that there is no stem cell hierarchy in acute B lymphoblastic leukaemia.","['Copyright (c) 2013 The Authors.

As in other solid tumors, populations of glioblastoma stem-like cells (GSCs) endowed with tumor initiating and therapeutic resistance properties have been identified. Glioblastomas are highly vascularized tumors resulting in a rich dialog between GSCs and endothelial cells. In one direction, endothelial cells and their secreted proteins are able to sustain GSC properties while, in turn, GSCs can promote neoangiogenesis, modulate endothelial cell functions and may even transdifferentiate into endothelial cells. Accordingly, targeting tumor vasculature seems a promising issue despite incomplete and transient results obtained from anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapeutic trials. Recent findings of novel GSC-secreted molecules with pro-angiogenic properties (Semaphorin 3A, hepatoma-derived growth factor) open the path to the design of a concerted attack of glioblastoma vasculature that could overcome the development of resistance to single-targeted therapies while keeping away the toxicity of the treatments.","['(c) 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

BCR-ABL-mediated signal transduction cascades in leukemic cells are assembled and modulated by a finely controlled network of protein-protein interactions, mediated by characteristic signaling domains and their respective binding motifs. BCR-ABL functions in a cell context-specific and cell type-specific manner to integrate signals that affect uncontrolled cellular proliferation. In this review, we draw attention to the recent progress made in outlining resistance against TRAIL-mediated apoptosis and diametrically opposed roles of miRNAs in BCR-ABL-positive leukemic cells. BCR-ABL governs carcinogenesis through well-organized web of antiapoptotic proteins and over-expressed oncomirs which target death receptors and pro-apoptotic genes. Set of oncomirs which inversely correlate with expression of TRAIL via suppression of SMAD is an important dimension which is gradually gaining attention of the researchers. Contrary to this, some current findings show a new role of BCR-ABL in nucleus with spotlight on apoptosis. It seems obvious that genetic heterogeneity of leukemias poses therapeutic challenges, and pharmacological agents that target components of the cancer promoting nano-machinery still need broad experimental validation to be considered competent as a component of the therapeutic arsenal for this group of diseases.

The present study investigated the cytotoxicity of both CAUE and its parent compound, caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE), and characterized the mechanisms by which they induce apoptosis in the human B cell leukemia cell line NALM-6. Treatment with CAUE reduced cell survival in NALM-6 cells but had no significant effect on the survival of normal lymphocytes. When assessing the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) for cytotoxicity, CAUE had 10-fold higher activity than CAPE in NALM-6 cells. CAUE treatment resulted in induction of apoptotic features in NALM-6 cells, including cleaved poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase and activated caspase-3. A caspase inhibitor completely blocked CAUE-induced apoptosis. CAUE treatment resulted in a concentration- and time-dependent decrease in both mitochondrial membrane potential and downregulation of Bcl-2 expression. Moreover, CAUE-induced apoptosis was enhanced in the Bcl-2 knockdown condition induced by small interfering RNA. These data suggest that CAUE-induced apoptosis was mediated via an apoptotic intrinsic pathway including mitochondrial damage and was caspase-dependent.

The presence of spatial clustering would be consistent with geographically localized environmental exposures over long periods of time. The present study is the first to examine spatial clustering amongst children aged 0-4 years using population-based data from Hungary. The data set consisted of 134 children diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia who were resident in part of Hungary during the period 1981-2000. Two levels of spatial aggregation were examined: counties and settlements. The Potthoff-Whittinghill and Moran I autocorrelation methods were used to test for spatial clustering. Additionally, an evaluation of the environmental changes during the study period was considered. Specifically analyses were carried out on sub-periods to investigate a possible effect of the Chernobyl catastrophe. There was statistically significant spatial clustering both at the county (estimate of extra-Poisson variation [Formula: see text], P = 0.04) and settlement levels (estimate of extra-Poisson variation [Formula: see text], P = 0.0003). At county level, the finding was attributable to clustering amongst female cases, but at settlement level, the finding was limited to male cases. There was significant spatial autocorrelation in the sub-periods immediately following the accident (1986-1990 & 1991-1995), but not before 1986, nor after 1995. A significant autocorrelation was observed during the 5 year period immediately following the accident (1986-1990, global Moran I = 0.1334, p = 0.005). The centre of significant excesses of ALL cases was located in the county of Baranya. Our study is consistent with an environmental aetiology for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in children associated with constant exposure to an, as yet unknown, environmental factor in small geographical areas.

Additionally we identified and quantified BCR-ABL1 transcript variants and analyzed 1236T>C ABCB1 and 480G>C SLC22A1 polymorphisms. A relationship between the type of BCR-ABL1 transcript or ABCB1 or SLC22A1 genotype and response to treatment was not discovered. However, the studied genes had higher expression levels in follow-up compared to the diagnostic samples, demonstrating a possible induction in expression. IM-sensitive patients presented significantly higher values of SLC22A1 expression, suggesting higher drug influx. Most importantly, while responding patients demonstrated stable expression signatures in consecutive samples, there was considerable variation in IM-resistant patients, indicating that single point sampling expression signatures are not reliable in predicting clinical outcomes or prognostic features in these patients.

We conducted a phase I/II open-label clinical study, to determine the safety and tolerability of acadesine given intravenously as a 4-h infusion to CLL patients. METHODS: Patient population included CLL patients with relapsed/refractory disease who had received one or more prior lines of treatment including either a fludarabine or an alkylator-based regimen. Twenty-four patients were included: eighteen in Part I treated at single doses of 50-315 mg/kg, and six in Part II, three with two doses at 210 mg/kg and three with five doses at 210 mg/kg. RESULTS: A manageable and predictable safety profile was demonstrated for acadesine at single doses between 50 and 210 mg/kg; 210 mg/kg was the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and optimal biological dose (OBD). Grade >/=2 hyperuricemia occurred commonly but was not clinically significant and resolved with the administration of prophylactic allopurinol. Other adverse events included transient anemia and/or thrombocytopenia (not clinically significant), renal impairment, and transient infusion-related hypotension (clinically significant). Trends of efficacy such as a reduction of peripheral CLL cells and reduction in lymphadenopathy were observed; however, the results were variable due to the small population and the range of doses tested.

ATRA enhances hematopoietic stem cell self-renewal through retinoic acid receptor (RAR)gamma activation while promoting differentiation of committed myeloid progenitors through RARalpha activation. Its lack of success in the treatment of non-APL acute myeloid leukemia (AML) may be related to ATRA's non-selectivity for the RARalpha and RARgamma isotypes, and specific RARalpha activation may be more beneficial in promoting myeloid differentiation. To investigate this hypothesis, the effects of ATRA and the specific RARalpha agonist NRX195183 was assessed in AML1-ETO (AE)-expressing murine bone marrow (BM) progenitors. ATRA potentiated the in vitro clonogenicity of these cells while NRX195183 had the opposite effect.

In the ATRA-treated AE cells, gene expression analyses revealed functional networks involving SERPINE1 and bone morphogenetic protein 2; AKT phosphorylation was upregulated.

Here, we show that FBXW7 targets the glucocorticoid receptor alpha (GRalpha) for ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation in a manner dependent on glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta-mediated phsophorylation. FBXW7 inactivation caused elevated GRalpha levels, and enhanced the transcriptional response to glucocorticoids. There was significant enhancement of GR transcriptional responses in FBXW7-deficient cell lines and primary T-ALL samples, in particular, for those pro-apoptotic regulatory proteins, BIM and PUMA. Reduced FBXW7 expression or function promoted glucocorticoid sensitivity, but not sensitivity to other chemotherapeutic agents used in T-ALL. Moreover, this was a general feature of different cancer cell types. Taken together, our work defines GRalpha as a novel FBXW7 substrate and demonstrates that favorable patient prognosis in T-ALL is associated with FBXW7 mutations due to enhanced GRalpha levels and steroid sensitivity.

We investigated the role of activated AMPK in supporting leukemic cell survival and evaluated AMPK as a potential drug target. Exposure of leukemic cells to the commercial AMPK inhibitor compound C resulted in massive apoptosis only in cells with MLL gene rearrangements. These results were confirmed by targeting AMPK with specific short hairpin RNAs. Compound C-induced apoptosis was associated with mitochondrial membrane depolarization, reactive oxygen species production, cytochrome c release and caspases cleavage, indicating intrinsic apoptosis pathway activation. Treatment with low concentrations of compound C resulted in a strong antileukemic activity, together with cytochrome c release and cleavage of caspases and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, also in MLL-rearranged primary BCP-ALL samples. Moreover, AMPK inhibition in MLL-rearranged cell lines synergistically enhanced the antiproliferative effects of vincristine, daunorubicin, cytarabine, dexamethasone and L-asparaginase in most of the evaluated conditions.

We aimed to determine the clinical characteristics and outcome of adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma patients in a nonendemic country. Cases of adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma managed at Hospital Universitari Vall d'Hebron, Barcelona, Spain were reviewed. Information on the foreign population living in Spain, according to country of origin, was obtained using official published data from the National Statistics Institute. Three patients were diagnosed with adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma between 2003 and 2010. Two cases were of the acute subtype and one case of the lymphoma subtype. Two patients were female and the mean age at presentation was 41.3 years. Patients originated from three different countries. The characteristics of the attended patients include widespread enlargement of the lymph nodes, a variety of multiple extranodal involvements, bone marrow infiltration, and a high incidence of infections including latent parasitic infections. Prototypic adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma presenting with high white cell counts, flower cells, and hypercalcemia was not observed. Regarding therapy, one patient received chemotherapy alone and two subjects combined first-line therapy including antiviral drugs. Of the three patients, two are dead (mean survival time 6 months) and one has been lost to follow-up. We estimate that at least 15,000 people living in Spain are infected with human T cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1). Adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma is a heterogeneous disease that often presents without distinguishing or prototypical features. A high index of clinical suspicion is essential for diagnosis. Several epidemiological differences have been observed in different countries.

TCRzeta 3'-UTR splice variants were identified in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 14 healthy individuals, 40 patients with CML and 22 patients with CML in complete remission (CML-CR) by RT-PCR. The expression level of the TCRzeta, FcepsilonRIgamma, ASF/SF-2 and ZAP-70 genes was analyzed by real-time quantitative PCR. While the expression of TCRzeta gene in the CML group was significantly lower than that in the healthy individual and CML-CR groups, a significantly higher expression of the FceRIgamma and ASF/SF-2 genes was found in the CML group. Two types of splicing forms were detected in all of the healthy individual CML-CR cases: wild type (WT) TCRzeta 3'-UTR and alternatively splieced (AS) TCRzeta 3'-UTR which have been alternatively splieced in the WT TCRzeta 3'-UTR . However, 35% of the CML cases contained only the wild type TCRzeta 3'-UTR isoform. Based on the TCRzeta 3'-UTR isoform expression characteristic, we divided the patients with CML into two subgroups: the WT+AS- CML group, containing patients that express only the wild type TCRzeta 3'-UTR, and the WT+AS+ CML group, which contained patients that expressed two TCRzeta 3'-UTR isoforms. A significantly different ASF/SF-2 and FcepsilonRIgamma gene expression pattern was found between the WT+AS- and WT+AS+CML groups. We concluded that defective TCRzeta expression may be characterized in the WT+AS-and WT+AS+CML subgroups by the different gene expression pattern. The overexpression of ASF/SF2, which alternatively splices the TCRzeta 3'-UTR, is thought to participate in feedback regulation. The characteristics of TCRzeta 3'-UTR alternative splicing may be a novel immunological marker for the evaluation of the CML immune status.",,"['Zha, Xianfeng', 'Yan, Xiaojuan', 'Shen, Qi', 'Zhang, Yuping', 'Wu, Xiuli', 'Chen, Shaohua', 'Li, Bo', 'Yang, Lijian', 'Geng, Suxia', 'Weng, Jianyu', 'Du, Xin', 'Li, Yangqiu']","['Zha X', 'Yan X', 'Shen Q', 'Zhang Y', 'Wu X', 'Chen S', 'Li B', 'Yang L', 'Geng S', 'Weng J', 'Du X', 'Li Y']","['Institute of Hematology, Medical College, Jinan University, Guangzhou, 510632, China.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121210,England,J Hematol Oncol,Journal of hematology & oncology,101468937,"[""0 (3' Untranslated Regions)"", '0 (FcepsilonRI gamma-chain, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '0 (antigen T cell receptor, zeta chain)', '170974-22-8 (Serine-Arginine Splicing Factors)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP70 protein, human)']",IM,,"[""3' Untranslated Regions/genetics"", 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', '*Alternative Splicing', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Protein Isoforms', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*genetics', 'Receptors, IgE/*genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Serine-Arginine Splicing Factors', 'Young Adult', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase/*genetics']",PMC3544630,,2012/12/12 06:00,2013/06/29 06:00,['2012/12/12 06:00'],"['2012/09/25 00:00 [received]', '2012/12/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/12/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/12/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/29 06:00 [medline]']","['1756-8722-5-74 [pii]', '10.1186/1756-8722-5-74 [doi]']",epublish,J Hematol Oncol. 2012 Dec 10;5:74. doi: 10.1186/1756-8722-5-74.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Farnesyltransferase inhibitors (FTIs) have been developed as a strategy to inhibit the function of these proteins. As FTIs inhibit proliferation of melanoma cell lines, we undertook a study to assess the impact of a FTI in advanced melanoma. As farnesylated proteins are also important for T cell activation, measurement of effects on T cell function was also pursued. METHODS: A 3-stage trial design was developed with a maximum of 40 patients and early stopping if there were no responders in the first 14, or fewer than 2 responders in the first 28 patients. Eligibility included performance status of 0-1, no prior chemotherapy, at most 1 prior immunotherapy, no brain metastases, and presence of at least 2 cutaneous lesions amenable to biopsy. R115777 was administered twice per day for 21 days of a 28-day cycle. Patients were evaluated every 2 cycles by RECIST. Blood and tumor were analyzed pre-treatment and during week 7. RESULTS: Fourteen patients were enrolled. Two patients had grade 3 toxicities, which included myelosuppression, nausea/vomiting, elevated BUN, and anorexia. There were no clinical responses. All patients analyzed showed potent inhibition of FT activity (85-98%) in tumor tissue; inhibition of phosphorylated ERK and Akt was also observed. T cells showed evidence of FT inhibition and diminished IFN-gamma production. CONCLUSIONS: Despite potent target inhibition, R115777 showed no evidence of clinical activity in this cohort of melanoma patients. Inhibition of T cell function by FTIs has potential clinical implications.

Balance abilities have been investigated solely in survivors of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia or central nervous system tumours. The literature tends to support the idea that survivors present with balance difficulties but the results need to be closely scrutinised. Several studies report results using the same experimental group, while other studies use balance outcome measures that have not had their psychometric properties assessed with this population. There are also few studies that evaluate dynamic balance abilities in survivors of paediatric cancers, which may be more influential on functional tasks. Furthermore, very few of the included studies investigate how the found balance deficits affect this population's daily lives, which would be necessary in order to determine if intervention should be geared towards this area.

This report describes a retrospective study of 38 French patients who received clofarabine as a monotherapy or in combination for relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) outside of clinical trials after marketing authorization. METHODS: We retrospectively analysed data for 38 patients, up to 21 years old, attending 17 French centres. Thirty patients received clofarabine alone or in combination for a bone marrow relapse of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) or refractory disease and eight patients for a high level of minimal residual disease (MRD). Survival and response durations were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: For the 30 patients who received clofarabine for a bone marrow relapse of ALL (number of relapse, 1-3; median, 1), the overall remission rate (ORR) was 37%: eight complete remission (CR) and three complete remission without platelet recovery (CRp). Ten of the 11 responding patients subsequently underwent haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).Only four of the eight patients who received clofarabine while in remission for a high level of MRD, showed a moderate improvement of MRD. Seven of these eight patients received HSCT and six of them were alive at the end of the study. One other patient was alive without receiving HSCT.However, clofarabine treatment was associated with a high risk of infection and hepatotoxicity. Febrile neutropenia grade >/= 3 was reported in 79% of patients and documented infections grade >/= 3 occurred in nine patients (24%). Hepatotoxicity grade 3 was reported in nine patients (24%).

Methods based on antigen detection, such as p24 for HIV, or on genome detection are virus specific and sometimes suffer from a limited dynamic range of detection. In contrast, measurement of reverse transcriptase (RT) activity is a generic method which can be adapted for higher sensitivity using real-time PCR quantification (qPCR-based product-enhanced RT (PERT) assay). We present an evaluation of a modified SYBR Green I-based PERT assay (SG-PERT), using commercially available reagents such as MS2 RNA and ready-to-use qPCR mixes. This assay has a dynamic range of 7 logs, a sensitivity of 10 nU HIV-1 RT and outperforms p24 ELISA for HIV titer determination by lower inter-run variation, lower cost and higher linear range. The SG-PERT values correlate with transducing and infectious units in HIV-based viral vector and replication-competent HIV-1 preparations respectively. This assay can furthermore quantify Moloney Murine Leukemia Virus-derived vectors and can be performed on different instruments, such as Roche Lightcycler(R) 480 and Applied Biosystems ABI 7300.

The main objective of this study was to investigate the association between benzene exposure and DNA methylation, both in repeated elements and candidate genes, in a population of 158 Bulgarian petrochemical workers and 50 unexposed office workers. Exposure assessment included personal monitoring of airborne benzene at work and urinary biomarkers of benzene metabolism (S-phenylmercapturic acid [SPMA] and trans,trans-muconic acid [t,t-MA]) at the end of the work-shift. The median levels of airborne benzene, SPMA and t,t-MA in workers were 0.46 ppm, 15.5 microg/L and 711 microg/L respectively, and exposure levels were significantly lower in the controls. Repeated-element DNA methylation was measured in Alu and LINE-1, and gene-specific methylation in MAGE and p15. DNA methylation levels were not significantly different between exposed workers and controls (P>0.05). Both ordinary least squares (OLS) and beta-regression models were used to estimate benzene-methylation associations. Beta-regression showed better model specification, as reflected in improved coefficient of determination (pseudo R(2)) and Akaike's information criterion (AIC). In beta-regression, we found statistically significant reductions in LINE-1 (-0.15%, P<0.01) and p15 (-0.096%, P<0.01) mean methylation levels with each interquartile range (IQR) increase in SPMA. This study showed statistically significant but weak associations of LINE-1 and p15 hypomethylation with SPMA in Bulgarian petrochemical workers.

Nanotherapeutics offer a novel approach to overcome these problems and here we ask if creation of ""stealth"" islets encapsulated within a thin cage of pegylated material of 100-200 nanometers thick provides a viable option for islet transplantation. The aims of this study were to test islet viability and functionality following encapsulation within the pegylated cage, and functional efficacy in vivo in terms of graft-derived control of normoglycemia in diabetic mice. We first demonstrated that pegylation of the islet surface, plus or minus nanoparticles, improved long-term islet viability in vitro compared to non-pegylated (naked) control islets. Moreover, pegylation of the islets with nanoparticles was compatible with glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and insulin biogenesis. We next looked for functionality of the created ""stealth"" DBA/2 (H-2(d)) islets in vivo by comparing glycemic profiles across 4 groups of streptozotozin-induced diabetic C57BL/6 (H-2(b)) recipients of (i) naked islets; (ii) pegylated islets; (iii) pegylated islets with nanoparticles (empty); and (iv) pegylated islets with nanoparticles loaded with a cargo of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), a factor both promotes adaptive immune tolerance and regulates pancreatic beta cell mass. Without any other treatment, normoglycemia was lost after 17 d (+/-7.5 d) in control group. In striking contrast, recipients in groups (ii), (iii), and (iv) showed long-term (>100 d) normoglycemia involving 30%; 43%, and 57% of the recipients in each respective group. In conclusion, construction of ""stealth"" islets by pegylation-based nanotherapeutics not only supports islet structure and function, but also effectively isolates the islets from immune-mediated destruction.

METHODS: We analyzed all consecutive cases of IPA in adults with hematologic diseases from January 2008 to January 2009 at a Catholic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT) Center in Seoul, Korea. RESULTS: A total of 54 patients were identified. Underlying diseases were acute myelogenous leukemia (n=25), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n=10), myelodysplastic syndrome (n=7), chronic myelogenous leukemia (n=3), multiple myeloma (n=3), severe aplastic anemia (n=2) and other hematologic diseases (n=4). Twenty six patients (48.2%) were assessed as having a favorable response, of which 16 patients (29.6%) showed complete response.

In particular, the availability of imatinib mesylate, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeting BCR-ABL, has led to profound and durable remissions in the majority of patients. However, a couple of issues have emerged and partially obscured this scenario. First, it has become clear that a significant proportion of patients either present with primary resistance to imatinib or develop secondary resistance sooner or later during treatment. Second, although the drug is generally well tolerated, a percentage of patients eventually cease treatment because of toxicity. Bearing this in mind, second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors have been introduced, including nilotinib. Phase I and II studies indicate remarkable activity for this compound in CML cases resistant to imatinib, including some of those carrying BCR-ABL1 mutants. More recently, two Phase II studies and a III randomized Phase clinical trial demonstrated the superiority of nilotinib compared with imatinib in terms of complete cytogenetic and major molecular responses, which are two relevant surrogate measures of long-term survival in CML.

Patients with V600 mutant v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 (B-RAF) positive metastatic melanoma are now treated with the RAF inhibitor, vemurafenib (Zelboraf) as a first line therapy. Vemurafenib decreases tumor size by at least 30% in approximately 50% of patients and increases progression-free survival and overall patient survival compared to the previous standard-of-care, dacarbazine. However, some patients treated with vemurafenib fail to show significant tumor shrinkage, and most patients who initially respond to the drug eventually show disease progression. Therefore, there is a clinical need to improve efficacy and prevent resistance to vemurafenib. It has been previously shown that cell death resulting from RAF/mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) inhibition is largely dependent on increased expression of pro-apoptotic, Bcl-2 homology domain (BH3)-only proteins, such as Bcl-2-like 11 (Bim-EL) and Bcl-2 modifying factor (Bmf). Here, we show that contrary to expression of Bim-EL and Bmf, the pro-apoptotic, BH3-only protein, phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate-induced protein 1 (Noxa), is strongly downregulated after RAF/MEK inhibition. This downregulation occurs at both the protein and mRNA level of expression and is associated with the inhibition of cell cycle progression. Restoring expression of Noxa in combination with RAF/MEK inhibition enhances cell death. Co-expression of the pro-survival, B-cell CLL/lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) family member, myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1 (Mcl-1), with Noxa fully mitigates the enhanced cell death associated with increased Noxa expression. These data indicate that manipulating the Noxa/Mcl-1 axis may enhance the efficacy of RAF/MEK inhibitors.",,"['Basile, Kevin J', 'Aplin, Andrew E']","['Basile KJ', 'Aplin AE']","['Department of Cancer Biology and Kimmel Cancer Center, Thomas Jefferson University 233 South 10th Street, Philadelphia, PA 19107, USA.']",['eng'],"['P30 CA056036/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA125103/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM067893/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",['Journal Article'],20121120,United States,Am J Cancer Res,American journal of cancer research,101549944,,,,,PMC3512187,,2012/12/12 06:00,2012/12/12 06:01,['2012/12/11 06:00'],"['2012/10/28 00:00 [received]', '2012/11/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/12/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/12/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/12 06:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Am J Cancer Res. 2012;2(6):726-35.

Accumulating evidence now indicates that c-Abl and/or Arg are activated in some solid tumor cell lines via unique mechanisms that do not involve gene mutation/translocation, and c-Abl/Arg activation promotes matrix degradation, invasion, proliferation, tumorigenesis, and/or metastasis, depending on the tumor type. However, some data suggest that c-Abl also may suppress invasion, proliferation, and tumorigenesis in certain cell contexts. Thus, c-Abl/Arg may serve as molecular switches that suppress proliferation and invasion in response to some stimuli (e.g., ephrins) or when inactive/regulated, or as promote invasion and proliferation in response to other signals (e.g., activated growth factor receptors, loss of inhibitor expression), which induce sustained activation. Clearly, more data are required to determine the extent and prevalence of c-Abl/Arg activation in primary tumors and during progression, and additional animal studies are needed to substantiate in vitro findings. Furthermore, c-Abl/Arg inhibitors have been used in numerous solid tumor clinical trials; however, none of these trials were restricted to patients whose tumors expressed highly activated c-Abl/Arg (targeted trial). Targeted trials are critical for determining whether c-Abl/Arg inhibitors can be effective treatment options for patients whose tumors are driven by c-Abl/Arg.",,"['Ganguly, Sourik S', 'Plattner, Rina']","['Ganguly SS', 'Plattner R']","['University of Kentucky School of Medicine, Lexington, KY, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA116784/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA166499/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['Journal Article'],,United States,Genes Cancer,Genes & cancer,101516546,,,,,PMC3513793,,2012/12/12 06:00,2012/12/12 06:01,['2012/12/11 06:00'],"['2012/12/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/12/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/12 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1177/1947601912458586 [doi]', '10.1177_1947601912458586 [pii]']",ppublish,Genes Cancer. 2012 May;3(5-6):414-25. doi: 10.1177/1947601912458586.,['NOTNLM'],"['Arg', 'c-Abl', 'solid tumor', 'tyrosine kinase']",,,,,,,,,,,

The activation of Abl by N-terminal fusions with Bcr (Bcr-Abl) or Gag (v-Abl) is responsible for chronic myeloid leukemia or Ph+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia and mouse leukemia virus, respectively. In addition, aberrant Abl and Arg activation downstream of several oncogenic growth factor receptors contributes to the development and progression of a variety of human cancers, often associated with poor clinical outcome, drug resistance, and tumor invasion and metastasis. Abl activation can occur by a variety of mechanisms that include domain interactions involving structural remodeling of autoinhibited conformations as well as direct phosphorylation by upstream kinases and phosphatases. Constitutive activation of Abl plays a significant role in regulating the actin cytoskeleton by modulating cell adhesion, motility, and invadopodia. This review addresses the role of Abl and Arg in tumor progression with particular emphasis on the roles of Crk and Abi1 adapter proteins as distinct molecular switches for Abl transactivation.

The past 35 years of research have yielded significant insight into the pathogenesis of HTLV-1, including the molecular characterization of Tax, the viral transactivator, and oncoprotein. In spite of these efforts, the mechanisms of oncogenesis of this pleiotropic protein remain to be fully elucidated. In this review, we illustrate the multiple oncogenic roles of Tax by summarizing a recent body of literature that refines our understanding of cellular transformation. A focused range of topics are discussed in this review including Tax-mediated regulation of the viral promoter and other cellular pathways, particularly the connection of the NF-kappaB pathway to both post-translational modifications (PTMs) of Tax and subcellular localization. Specifically, recent research on polyubiquitination of Tax as it relates to the activation of the IkappaB kinase (IKK) complex is highlighted. Regulation of the cell cycle and DNA damage responses due to Tax are also discussed, including Tax interaction with minichromosome maintenance proteins and the role of Tax in chromatin remodeling. The recent identification of HTLV-3 has amplified the importance of the characterization of emerging viral pathogens. The challenge of the molecular determination of pathogenicity and malignant disease of this virus lies in the comparison of the viral transactivators of HTLV-1, -2, and -3 in terms of transformation and immortalization.

Thus, we aimed at investigating the association of SNPs in TP53 gene with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 236 CML and 157 control samples were analysed for mutations in TP53 gene using polymerase chain reaction followed by direct sequencing. RESULTS: Sequencing analysis for mutations in exons 7-9 of the TP53 gene revealed four SNPs, three in intron 7 (C14181T, T14201G, and C14310T) and one SNP in intron 6 (A13463G) of TP53 gene. The mutation C14181T is located at position 72 base pairs downstream of the 3'-end of exon 7 of the P53 gene. This mutation is in complete linkage disequilibrium with a T14201G mutation, 20 base pairs further downstream occurring at position 14201. This mutation occurred only in the presence of C14181T mutation and these mutations showed association with advanced phase and cytogenetic poor response. Another two novel mutations, C14310T in intron 7 and A13463G in intron 6 were also found to be associated with cytogenetic poor response.

The efficacy of different immunotherapeutic strategies is best investigated in conditions that are as physiologic as possible. We have therefore compared the activity OFA and rituximab (RTX), alone or in combination with chemotherapeutic agents in unmanipulated whole blood assays, using flow cytometry. OFA (10-100 mug/ml) lysed B-CLL targets in whole blood more efficiently and with faster kinetics than RTX, with a mean 56% lysis at 24 h compared with 16%. This activity of OFA was fully complement dependent, as shown by >99% inhibition by anti-C5 Ab eculizumab and a lack of NK cell activation in whole blood. OFA-mediated NK cell activation was blocked by complement. OFA-mediated lysis could be increased an additional 15% by blocking CD55 and CD59 complement inhibitors. Interestingly, OFA-mediated lysis correlated significantly with CD20 expression levels (r(2) = 0.79). OFA showed overlapping dose response curves similar to those for RTX in phagocytosis assays using either human macrophages or neutrophils. However, phagocytosis was inhibited in the presence of serum or whole blood. Finally, combined treatment with mafosfamide and fludarabine showed that these therapeutic drugs are synergistic in B-CLL whole blood assays and show superior activity when combined with OFA compared with RTX. These results confirm in B-CLL samples and in physiologic conditions the superior complement mediated cytotoxicity induced by OFA alone compared with RTX, the lack of NK cell activation, and phagocytosis in these conditions and suggest effective chemoimmunotherapy strategies using this new generation anti-CD20 Ab.",,"['Bologna, Luca', 'Gotti, Elisa', 'Da Roit, Fabio', 'Intermesoli, Tamara', 'Rambaldi, Alessandro', 'Introna, Martino', 'Golay, Josee']","['Bologna L', 'Gotti E', 'Da Roit F', 'Intermesoli T', 'Rambaldi A', 'Introna M', 'Golay J']","['Laboratory of Cellular Therapy G.

The aim of this study was to analyze the impact of lymphocyte recovery after allogeneic stem cell transplantation in children with hematologic malignancies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated 69 children transplanted for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (n=34), acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (n=26), chronic leukemia (n=7) and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (n=2) between 1996 and 2008 at the Chonnam National University Hospital, Korea. The patients were grouped based on absolute lymphocyte counts (ALC) <500/muL or >/= 500/muL at D+21 and D+30 after transplant. RESULTS: Patients with a High ALC at D+21 and D+30 had a faster neutrophil and platelet engraftment. The High at D+30 group had a better 5 year overall survival (71% vs. 53%, p=0.043) and event-free survival (72% vs. 53%, p=0.065) than the Low at D+30 group. The incidence of grade II-IV acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), and relapse rate did not differ by the ALC counts. However, the Low at D+30 group had a significantly increased risk for transplant-related mortality (p=0.019). The univariate analysis showed that the factors associated with decreased survival were a Low ALC at D+30, patients with high risk ALL, and grade II-IV aGVHD in patients with ALL and AML.

Such data have recently attracted a great deal of attention and some methods have been developed. However, most of those methods treat the observation process as a recurrent event process, which assumes that one observation can immediately follow another. Sometimes, this is not the case, as there may be some delay or observation duration. Such a process is often referred to as a recurrent episode process. One example is the medical cost related to hospitalization, where each hospitalization serves as a single observation. For the problem, we present a joint analysis approach for regression analysis of both longitudinal and observation processes and a simulation study is conducted that assesses the finite sample performance of the approach. The asymptotic properties of the proposed estimates are also given and the method is applied to the medical cost data that motivated this study.","['(c) 2012 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

One of the most common methods is to assess ZAP70 levels in CLL cells by calculating the ratio between ZAP70 mean fluorescence intensities (MFIs) in residual T-cells and CLL B-cells (ZAP70 T/B ratio). In this study, we developed a new method for ZAP70 labeling. Cells were labeled with a combination of anti ZAP70 phycoerythrin-conjugated SBZAP monoclonal antibody (mAb) and mAbs against CD45, CD19, and CD5. The latter three were used to specifically gate on different lymphocyte subsets. Staining was performed in absence (test) or in presence of excess unconjugated SBZAP mAb (isoclonic control). A so-called ZAP70 isoclonic ratio between SBZAP MFIs in the test and isoclonic control was calculated. A series of 32 patients with CLL and 10 normal controls were studied. Prediction of IGHV mutation status by ZAP70 isoclonic and T/B ratios was similar. By using the ZAP70 isoclonic ratio, we showed that ZAP70 expression was increased in T-cells from CLL patients. Nearly all cases with increased ZAP70 expression in CLL cells were associated with high ZAP70 expression in cognate T-cells. Therefore, the ZAP70 isoclonic ratio was more likely to closely reflect the biology of ZAP70 dysregulation rather than the T/B ratio. These results also explained why ZAP70 T/B ratios were artefactually close to normal in cells from CLL patients with high levels of ZAP70.",['Copyright (c) 2012 International Clinical Cytometry Society.'],"['Rizzo, David', 'Bouvier, Gaelle', 'Youlyouz-Marfak, Ibtissam', 'Guerin, Estelle', 'Trimoreau, Franck', 'Bordessoule, Dominique', 'Jaccard, Arnaud', 'Gachard, Nathalie', 'Feuillard, Jean']","['Rizzo D', 'Bouvier G', 'Youlyouz-Marfak I', 'Guerin E', 'Trimoreau F', 'Bordessoule D', 'Jaccard A', 'Gachard N', 'Feuillard J']","['Department of Biology, Laboratory of Haematology, University Hospital Dupuytren, Limoges, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121206,United States,Cytometry B Clin Cytom,"Cytometry.

In search of new recurrent balanced translocations, we reviewed the Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) cytogenetics database containing pretreatment and relapse karyotypes of 4,701 adults with AML and 565 with MDS who were treated on CALGB trials. We identified all cases with balanced structural rearrangements occurring as a sole abnormality or in addition to one other abnormality, excluded abnormalities known to be recurrent, and then reviewed the literature to determine whether any of what we considered unique, previously unknown abnormalities had been reported. As a result, we identified seven new recurrent balanced translocations in AML or MDS: t(7;11)(q22;p15.5), t(10;11)(q23;p15), t(2;12)(p13;p13), t(12;17)(p13;q12), t(2;3)(p21;p21), t(5;21)(q31;q22), and t(8;14)(q24.1;q32.2), and additionally, t(10;12)(p11;q15), a new translocation in AML previously reported in a case of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Herein, we report hematologic and clinical characteristics and treatment outcomes of patients with these newly recognized recurrent translocations. We also report 52 unique balanced translocations, together with the clinical data of patients harboring them, which to our knowledge have not been previously published. We hope that once the awareness of their existence is increased, some of these translocations may become recognized as novel recurring abnormalities. Identification of additional cases with both the new recurrent and the unique balanced translocations will enable determination of their prognostic significance and help to provide insights into the mechanisms of disease pathogenesis in patients with these rare abnormalities.","['Copyright (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Walker, Alison', 'Mrozek, Krzysztof', 'Kohlschmidt, Jessica', 'Rao, Kathleen W', 'Pettenati, Mark J', 'Sterling, Lisa J', 'Marcucci, Guido', 'Carroll, Andrew J', 'Bloomfield, Clara D']","['Walker A', 'Mrozek K', 'Kohlschmidt J', 'Rao KW', 'Pettenati MJ', 'Sterling LJ', 'Marcucci G', 'Carroll AJ', 'Bloomfield CD']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.']",['eng'],"['U10CA077440/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA031946/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10CA032291/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA101140/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K12 CA133250/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA77658/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA133250/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10CA047559/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10CA041287/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA31946/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10CA059518/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA140158/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10CA047577/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA33601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA140158/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA16058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA101140/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA077658/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA033601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10CA077658/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10CA035279/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10CA138561/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121210,United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,,IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Karyotype', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics/pathology/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/methods', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",PMC3874732,['NIHMS534382'],2012/12/12 06:00,2013/08/21 06:00,['2012/12/11 06:00'],"['2012/10/25 00:00 [received]', '2012/10/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/12/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/12/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/gcc.22036 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2013 Apr;52(4):385-401. doi: 10.1002/gcc.22036.

Existing albumin-based drug delivery systems are often limited by their low drug loading capacity as well as noticeable drug leakage into the blood circulation. Therefore, a unique albumin-derived core-shell doxorubicin (DOX) delivery system based on the protein denaturing-backfolding strategy was developed. 28 DOX molecules were covalently conjugated to the albumin polypeptide backbone via an acid sensitive hydrazone linker. Polycationic and pegylated human serum albumin formed two non-toxic and enzymatically degradable protection shells around the encapsulated DOX molecules. This core-shell delivery system possesses notable advantages, including a high drug loading capacity critical for low administration doses, a two-step drug release mechanism based on pH and the presence of proteases, an attractive biocompatibility and narrow size distribution inherited from the albumin backbone, as well as fast cellular uptake and masking of epitopes due to a high degree of pegylation.

The high incidence of such aberrations indicates that additional changes are important, perhaps necessary, for malignant transformation, i.e., the 8q24/MYC rearrangements may not be sufficient. To investigate this possibility, we performed single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array analysis on 20 cases of 8q24/MYC-positive BL. Nineteen (95%) harbored genomic imbalances; the only case without such aberrations displayed secondary changes by chromosome banding analysis. Thus, all BL cases had abnormalities in addition to the 8q24 translocation. The adult cases harbored more changes (median 3; range 1-21) than did the childhood cases (median 1.5; range 0-5) (P = 0.034). Several recurrent aberrations were detected by SNP array analysis, in particular losses of 6q14.1-q22.33, 9p21.3, and 13q14.2-q14.3, gains of 1q23.3-q31.3, chromosome 7, 13q31.3, and partial uniparental isodisomies for 6p12.2-pter, 9p23-pter, and 17p11.2-pter. The molecular genetic consequences of these changes include deletions of the CDKN2A and TP53 genes, and gains/losses of several genes, such as MIR17HG and E2F2K, involved in the MYC pathway. Thus, deregulation of the MYC pathway, both directly through the 8q24/MYC translocation and indirectly through secondary genomic imbalances, may be essential not only for the initiation but also for the progression of BL.","['Copyright (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Lundin, Catarina', 'Hjorth, Lars', 'Behrendtz, Mikael', 'Ehinger, Mats', 'Biloglav, Andrea', 'Johansson, Bertil']","['Lundin C', 'Hjorth L', 'Behrendtz M', 'Ehinger M', 'Biloglav A', 'Johansson B']","['Department of Clinical Genetics, University and Regional Laboratories, Skane University Hospital, Lund University, Lund, Sweden. catarina.lundin@med.lu.se']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121208,United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)'],IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*genetics/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Disorders/*genetics/pathology', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 2/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 22/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8/genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Microarray Analysis/methods', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Young Adult']",,,2012/12/12 06:00,2013/08/21 06:00,['2012/12/11 06:00'],"['2012/05/25 00:00 [received]', '2012/10/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/12/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/12/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/gcc.22034 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2013 Apr;52(4):370-7. doi: 10.1002/gcc.22034.

Since lung cancer cells possess an ability to resist anoikis, resulting in a high rate of metastasis and death, the present study aimed to investigate the possible anoikis-sensitizing effect of artonin E (AE). MATERIALS AND METHODS: AE was extracted from bark of Artocarpus gomezianus. Anoikis sensitization of AE was investigated in H460, A549 and H292 human lung cancer cells. The level of anoikis-related proteins was determined by western blot analysis and viable cells were measured by the 2,3-bis-(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide (XTT) method. RESULTS: AE was shown to enhance anoikis of H460 cells in a dose-dependent manner. We investigated the underlying mechanisms of AE on anoikis sensitization and found that AE sensitized the cells by down-regulating the anti-apoptotic myeloid leukemia cell sequence-1 (MCL1) protein but had no significant effect on other proteins of the B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL2) family, including BCL2 and BCL2-associated X protein (BAX). Anoikis sensitization of AE was consistently observed in A549 and H292 lung cancer cells.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Leukemia, breast and cervical cancer cell lines were exposed to D3CLP-alone or in combination with imatinib, tamoxifen or cisplatin, respectively. Cell viability after treatment was evaluated by the MTT assay, and cell death by the TUNEL assay. The effects of combined treatments were analyzed by combination index and isobolographic analysis. RESULTS: Antiproliferative activity results indicate that D3CLP in combination with antineoplastic drugs induced a synergistic effect, at 3:1 and 1:1 ratios for D3CLP plus imatinib in K-562 leukemia cells, and at a 3:1 ratio for D3CLP with cisplatin in HeLa cells, as determined by their combination index. Furthermore, isobolographic analysis demonstrated a significant synergism for a 3:1 combination ratio of D3CLP with cisplatin in HeLa cells. In addition, TUNEL assay suggests cell death by apoptosis of HeLa cells after treatment with D3CLP and its combination with cisplatin at a 3:1 ratio.

Therefore, we investigated whether single nucleotide polymorphisms in TNF and IL-10 may play a role in the clinical course of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). TNF-308G>A, IL-10-3575T>A, and IL-10-1082A>G seem to be functionally relevant, were genotyped in 292 previously untreated patients with CLL. The control group consisted of 192 randomly selected blood donors. The patients carrying TNF-308GG and IL-10-1082AA genotypes presented a higher 3-year treatment-free survival (56.6 vs. 40.6%, P = 0.05) as well as a 10-year overall survival (OS) rates (92.3 vs. 57.6%, P = 0.005) than those with other TNF-308 and IL-10-1082 genotype combinations. Multivariate analysis demonstrated the Rai stage (P = 0.0002), IGHV mutation status (P = 0.01), TNF-308G>A (P = 0.03), and TNF/IL-10 polymorphism-based risk groups (P = 0.05) to be independent factors predicting OS. When the mutated IGHV patients were analyzed, the homozygotes TNF-308GG and IL-10-1082AA presented a higher 10-year OS rate than those carrying other TNF-308 and IL-10-1082 genotypes (100 vs. 67.7%, P = 0.01).

Recent bone marrow aspiration showed no blast increase and recent peripheral blood sampling presented no evidence of relapse. RESULTS: The patient showed a viscous hypopyon and a myotic pupil in the right eye that was refractory to corticosteroids. Anterior chamber aspiration revealed atypical blasts similar to the leukemic cells that were found in the bone marrow aspirate at the time of systemic relapse.

METHODS: Karyotypes of 234 cases of de novo childhood AML were analyzed using short-term culture of bone marrow cells and R-banding. The fusion transcripts involving MLL gene and partial tandem duplication of MLL (MLL-PTD) were detected by multiple reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. Two cases with 11q23 translocation by karyotypic analysis but with negative result of multiple RT-PCR were studied with MLL-dual-color fluorescence in situ hybridization (D-FISH). RESULTS: R-banding karyotypic analysis has revealed 20 cases with 11q23 translocation (14 cases with M5, 4 cases with M4, 2 cases with M2), including 12 cases with t(9;11)(p22;q23), 3 cases with t(1;11)(q21;q23), 2 cases with t(6;11)(q27;q23), 1 case with t(11;19)(q23;p13), 1 with t(5;11)(q31;q23), and 1 with t(X;11)(q24;q23). Eighteen cases with 11q23 translocation having fusion transcripts involving MLL genes were confirmed with multiple RT-PCR; 2 cases showed negative results, but they were confirmed to have MLL rearrangements by D-FISH. MLL-PTD was also detected in 8 cases (4 cases M5, 2 cases M4, M2 and M6, one case each) from the other childhood AML cases. The total incidence of 11q23/MLL gene rearrangements was 11.97% (28/234), and most of patients(85.7%, 24/28) were M4/M5. The complete remission (CR) rate after treatment for the 28 cases with MLL rearrangements was 53.8%, the difference was significant by statistics (P< 0.05) compared with 90.5% for the control group (M4/M5 childhood AML with other karyotypic abnormalities or normal karyotype). Of them, 2 cases receiving intensive chemotherapy survived for 81 and 66 months, respectively, 4 cases receiving allogeneic stem cell transplantation survived for 21, 20, 16 and 11 months, respectively, and are still alive with CR. The medium survival (MS) time for 28 cases with 11q23/MLL rearrangements was 11 months, whereas the MS for control group was 15 months. The difference was not statistically significant(P> 0.05). CONCLUSION: The 11q23/MLL rearrangements is highly correlated with the occurrence of monocytic leukemia (M4 and M5). The 11q23 translocation and MLL-PTD are mutually exclusive, though both are indicative of poor prognosis. Intensive chemotherapy and allogeneic stem cell transplantation may ameliorate the clinical outcome.

D. Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC). Because the model required validation before its extensive use could be recommended, the authors sought to externally validate the nomogram in an independent, community-based cohort of patients with CLL. METHODS: In total, 328 previously untreated patients with newly diagnosed, asymptomatic, Binet stage A CLL from different primary hematology centers who were registered on a prospective basis during 2006 to 2010 on an observational database of the Italian Lymphoma Study Group were considered suitable for external validation of the model. RESULTS: A total point score was calculated for each patient using a formula proposed by MDACC investigators, and the median score was 19.9 (range, 0-69.5). Furthermore, when the score was evaluated as continuous variable (ie, by measuring the risk of each point increase), the total point score was associated with the time to first treatment (hazard ratio [HR], 1.04; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02-1.05; P < .0001). Receiver operating characteristic analysis identified a point score of 25 (area under curve; 0.64; sensitivity, 61.5; specificity, 72.1; P < .0001) as the best threshold capable of separating patients who needed therapy from patients who did not (HR, 3.27; 95% CI, 2,07-5.18; P < .0001). The prognostic index category also remained a predictor of the time to first treatment when the analysis was limited to patients with Rai stage 0 disease (HR, 4.05; 95% CI, 2.25-7.52; P < .0001). Finally, a goodness-of-fit test demonstrated that the nomogram model had a significantly good fit at 2 years (correlation coefficient [r(2) ] = 0.966; P = .002). CONCLUSIONS: The current results confirmed the ability of a newly developed prognostic index to predict the time to first treatment among previously untreated patients with CLL who had early disease and extended the utility of the model to those with Rai stage 0 disease. In addition, the actual and predicted time to first treatment outcomes revealed good agreement, suggesting that, externally, the results provided by the model are well calibrated. Cancer 2013.

DS is characterized by a number of phenotypes, including the development of Alzheimer's disease-like pathology and immunological, hematological and cardiovascular alterations. Apoptosis or programmed cell death is physiologically involved in development and aging, as well as in numerous pathological processes. Altered apoptosis has been proposed as a putative mechanism underlying many DS phenotypes. Evidence from human and animal studies indicates that apoptosis does not have a prominent role in the disturbances found in brain development in trisomy 21. However, alterations in apoptosis have been associated with neurodegeneration in the aging DS brain, with impairments in general growth and with immunological, cardiovascular and oncological alterations. Altered apoptosis in DS is likely to be the result of the interplay between several chromosome 21 (Hsa21) and non-Hsa21 genes.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We cultured in vitro malignant B cells freshly isolated from 44 patients with CLLs in the presence or the absence of different concentrations of fludarabine before or after 24-hour TLR stimulation with specific ligands and evaluated cell viability, apoptosis, and molecular pathways involved. RESULTS: Heterogeneity was observed among samples. In leukemic cells from patients bearing adverse prognostic factors, TLR stimulation caused a significant increase of protection to fludarabine treatment, whereas this did not occur in the cells from patients with good prognosis. To identify novel molecular mechanisms accounting for the dichotomy of response between the two groups of patients, we conducted an apoptosis gene expression profile on leukemic cells either unstimulated or stimulated with TLR9 ligand. Strikingly, TLR9 stimulation specifically upregulated the expression of lymphotoxin-alpha in cells where an increased protection to fludarabine treatment was observed. Also, the expression of miR-155-3p was significantly increased after stimulation of distinct TLR in cells where fludarabine treatment was less effective. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that at least in a proportion of patients, in vitro sensitivity to fludarabine may be modulated by the stimulation of TLR, likely mimicking microenvironmental signals occurring in vivo.",['(c)2012 AACR.'],"['Fonte, Eleonora', 'Apollonio, Benedetta', 'Scarfo, Lydia', 'Ranghetti, Pamela', 'Fazi, Claudia', 'Ghia, Paolo', 'Caligaris-Cappio, Federico', 'Muzio, Marta']","['Fonte E', 'Apollonio B', 'Scarfo L', 'Ranghetti P', 'Fazi C', 'Ghia P', 'Caligaris-Cappio F', 'Muzio M']","['San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Division of Molecular Oncology; Universita Vita-Salute San Raffaele, Via Olgettina 58, Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121205,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Lymphotoxin-alpha)', '0 (MIRN155 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptors)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/genetics', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*metabolism', 'Lymphotoxin-alpha/genetics/metabolism', 'MicroRNAs/genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Toll-Like Receptors/agonists/genetics/*metabolism', 'Vidarabine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology']",,,2012/12/12 06:00,2013/07/05 06:00,['2012/12/11 06:00'],"['2012/12/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/12/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/05 06:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-12-1922 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-12-1922 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2013 Jan 15;19(2):367-79. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-12-1922.

ANKRD26-RT is characterised by dysmegakaryopoiesis and an increased risk of leukaemia. PaCSs are novel particulate cytoplasmic structures with selective immunoreactivity for polyubiquitinated proteins and proteasome that have been detected in a number of solid cancers, in the epithelia of Helicobacter pylori gastritis and related preneoplastic lesions, and in the neutrophils of Schwachman-Diamond syndrome, a genetic disease with neutropenia and increased leukaemia risk. We searched for PaCSs in blood cells from 14 consecutive patients with ANKRD26-RT. Electron microscopy combined with immunogold staining for polyubiquitinated proteins, 20S and 19S proteasome showed PaCSs in most ANKRD26-RT platelets, as in a restricted minority of platelets from healthy controls and from subjects with other inherited or immune thrombocytopenias. In ANKRD26-RT platelets, the PaCS amount exceeded that of control platelets by a factor of 5 (p<0.0001). Immunoblotting showed that the higher PaCS number was associated with increased amounts of polyubiquitinated proteins and proteasome in ANKRD26-RT platelets. PaCSs were also extensively represented in ANKRD26-RT megakaryocytes, but not in healthy control megakaryocytes, and were absent in other ANKRD26-RT and control blood cells. Therefore, large amounts of PaCSs are a characteristic feature of ANKRD26-RT platelets and megakaryocytes, although these novel cell components are also present in a small subpopulation of normal platelets. The widespread presence of PaCSs in inherited diseases with increased leukaemia risk, as well as in solid neoplasms and their preneoplastic lesions, suggests a link of these structures with oncogenesis.",,"['Necchi, Vittorio', 'Balduini, Alessandra', 'Noris, Patrizia', 'Barozzi, Serena', 'Sommi, Patrizia', 'di Buduo, Christian', 'Balduini, Carlo L', 'Solcia, Enrico', 'Pecci, Alessandro']","['Necchi V', 'Balduini A', 'Noris P', 'Barozzi S', 'Sommi P', 'di Buduo C', 'Balduini CL', 'Solcia E', 'Pecci A']","['Department of Molecular Medicine, University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy.']",['eng'],['GGP10089/Telethon/Italy'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121206,Germany,Thromb Haemost,Thrombosis and haemostasis,7608063,['EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)'],IM,['Thromb Haemost. 2013 Feb;109(2):180.

Specifically, we demonstrate and analyze selection of (i) enhancers for folding by direct TAT translocation selection of a target protein interposed between the TorA signal sequence and betaL, (ii) dimeric or oligomeric protein-protein interactions by hitchhiker translocation (HiT) selection of proteins fused to the TorA signal sequence and to the betaL, respectively and (iii) heterotrimeric protein-protein interactions by combining HiT with protein fragment complementation selection of proteins fused to two split betaL fragments and TorA, respectively. The lactamase fragments were additionally engineered for improved activity and stability. Applicability was benchmarked with interaction partners of known affinity and multimerization whereby cellular fitness correlated well with biophysical protein properties. Ultimately, the HiT selection was employed to identify peptides, which specifically bind to leukemia- and melanoma-relevant target proteins (MITF and ETO) by coiled-coil or tetra-helix-bundle formation with high affinity.

The biologic and clinical significance of microRNA dysregulation associated with AML1/ETO expressed in t(8;21) AML is unknown. Here, we show that AML1/ETO triggers the heterochromatic silencing of microRNA-193a (miR-193a) by binding at AML1-binding sites and recruiting chromatin-remodeling enzymes. Suppression of miR-193a expands the oncogenic activity of the fusion protein AML-ETO, because miR-193a represses the expression of multiple target genes, such as AML1/ETO, DNMT3a, HDAC3, KIT, CCND1, and MDM2 directly, and increases PTEN indirectly.

These neutropenias may be isolated or associated with immunologic defects or extra-hematopoietic manifestations. Complications may occur as infectious diseases, but also less frequently as myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Recently, the transcription factor GATA2 has been identified as a new predisposing gene for familial AML/MDS. In the present study, we describe the initial identification by exome sequencing of a GATA2 R396Q mutation in a family with a history of chronic mild neutropenia evolving to AML and/or MDS. The subsequent analysis of the French Severe Chronic Neutropenia Registry allowed the identification of 6 additional pedigrees and 10 patients with 6 different and not previously reportedGATA2 mutations (R204X, E224X, R330X, A372T, M388V, and a complete deletion of the GATA2 locus). The frequent evolution to MDS and AML in these patients reveals the importance of screening GATA2 in chronic neutropenia associated with monocytopenia because of the frequent hematopoietic transformation, variable clinical expression at onset, and the need for aggressive therapy in patients with poor clinical outcome.

By studying the mechanism of this depletion, we herein report that iNKT cells exhibit a high susceptibility to apoptosis that is not observed with conventional T cells. Elevated expression of caspases 3 and 7 accounts for the proapoptotic phenotype of iNKT cells, which is inhibited by XIAP although it exerts a moderate effect in conventional T cells. Similarly, MAIT cells exhibit a proapoptotic propensity with elevated expression of activated caspases and are decreased in XIAP-deficient individuals. Knockdown of the transcription factor PLZF/ZBTB-16, which is involved in the effector program of iNKT cells, diminishes their proapoptotic phenotype. Conversely, overexpression of PLZF/ZBTB-16 in conventional T cells leads to a proapoptotic phenotype. Our findings identify a previously unknown pathway of regulation of innate-like T-cell homeostasis depending on XIAP and PLZF.

To determine the frequency of compound mutations among chronic myeloid leukemia patients on ABL1 TKI therapy, in the present study, we examined a collection of patient samples (N = 47) with clear evidence of 2 BCR-ABL1 kinase domain mutations by direct sequencing. Using a cloning and sequencing method, we found that 70% (33/47) of double mutations detected by direct sequencing were compound mutations. Sequential, branching, and parallel routes to compound mutations were common. In addition, our approach revealed individual and compound mutations not detectable by direct sequencing. The frequency of clones harboring compound mutations with more than 2 missense mutations was low (10%), whereas the likelihood of silent mutations increased disproportionately with the total number of mutations per clone, suggesting a limited tolerance for BCR-ABL1 kinase domain missense mutations.

The only SNP associated with outcome was M420del (rs35191146), with patients with the M420del demonstrating an increased probability of imatinib treatment failure. In CML cell lines transfected with M420del and/or M408V, M420del significantly decreased imatinib uptake, but this effect was countered if the M408V (rs628031) SNP was also present. A similar effect was seen for the uptake of the hOCT1 substrates TEA(+) and ASP(+).

This heterogeneity is often not reflected in standard treatment approaches which while providing predictable outcomes in the majority of patients fail in particular cases even with high-dose multiagent chemotherapy regimens. Further, the unselective effect of chemotherapy leads to high treatment-related toxicity and the enormous risk of infection during prolonged pancytopenia, preventing further dose escalation. OBJECTIVES: Cytokines play a role in leukemogenesis, AML cell persistence and treatment outcome. In this review we highlight cytokine dependent mechanisms essential for AML cell survival and the role of single cytokines in leukemogenesis and allogeneic transplantation-related phenomena. Cytokine-related mechanisms of leukemogenesis, AML cell persistence and resistance to chemotherapy are complex. Modulation of the cytokine network can disrupt signalling pathway activation and overcome the high resistance to treatment. It may also increase the selectivity of AML treatment, reduce the overall treatment-related toxicity and improve outcomes of AML treatment in all age groups of patients. CONCLUSIONS: This review provides a deeper insight into these processes with focus on the most vulnerable step. Special attention is paid to the possibility of selective influence on defined cell populations for therapeutic target. We believe that modulating cytokine-dependent processes in AML is an approach that could be included in standard chemotherapeutic regimens for improving overall treatment outcome.",,"['Kupsa, Tomas', 'Horacek, Jan Milos', 'Jebavy, Ladislav']","['Kupsa T', 'Horacek JM', 'Jebavy L']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Defence, Faculty of Military Health Sciences in Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic.

However hematological responses are not durable and disease relapse appears inevitable. Experimentally, leukemic stem/progenitor cells (LSC) propagate disease in animal models of AML and it has been postulated that their relative chemo-resistance contributes to disease relapse. We serially measured LSC numbers in patients with high-risk AML and MDS treated with 5'-azacitidine and sodium valproate (VAL-AZA). Fifteen out of seventy-nine patients achieved a complete remission (CR) or complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi) with VAL-AZA therapy. There was no significant reduction in the size of the LSC-containing population in non-responders. While the LSC-containing population was substantially reduced in all patients achieving a CR/CRi it was never eradicated and expansion of this population antedated morphological relapse. Similar studies were performed in seven patients with newly diagnosed AML treated with induction chemotherapy.

We hypothesized that AMPK-induced autophagy ameliorates diabetic cardiomyopathy by inhibiting cardiomyocyte apoptosis and examined the effects of AMPK on the interaction between Beclin1 and Bcl-2, a switch between autophagy and apoptosis, in diabetic mice and high glucose-treated H9c2 cardiac myoblast cells. Exposure of H9c2 cells to high glucose reduced AMPK activity, inhibited Jun NH2-terminal kinase 1 (JNK1)-B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) signaling, and promoted Beclin1 binding to Bcl-2. Conversely, activation of AMPK by metformin stimulated JNK1-Bcl-2 signaling and disrupted the Beclin1-Bcl-2 complex. Activation of AMPK, which normalized cardiac autophagy, attenuated high glucose-induced apoptosis in cultured H9c2 cells. This effect was attenuated by inhibition of autophagy. Finally, chronic administration of metformin in diabetic mice restored cardiac autophagy by activating JNK1-Bcl-2 pathways and dissociating Beclin1 and Bcl-2. The induction of autophagy protected against cardiac apoptosis and improved cardiac structure and function in diabetic mice. We concluded that dissociation of Bcl-2 from Beclin1 may be an important mechanism for preventing diabetic cardiomyopathy via AMPK activation that restores autophagy and protects against cardiac apoptosis.",,"['He, Chaoyong', 'Zhu, Huaiping', 'Li, Hongliang', 'Zou, Ming-Hui', 'Xie, Zhonglin']","['He C', 'Zhu H', 'Li H', 'Zou MH', 'Xie Z']","['Section of Molecular Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, USA.']",['eng'],"['HL-110488/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL089920/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL074399/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', '1P20-RR-024215-01/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL079584/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-080499/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-074399/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-096032/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-079584/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL110488/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL105157/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P20 RR024215/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL080499/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-089920/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL096032/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121207,United States,Diabetes,Diabetes,0372763,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Beclin-1)', '0 (Becn1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Blood Glucose)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 4)', 'EC 2.7.4.3 (Adenylate Kinase)', 'IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)']",IM,,"['Adenylate Kinase/genetics/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Autophagy', 'Beclin-1', 'Blood Glucose', 'Cell Line', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental/complications/*metabolism', 'Diabetic Cardiomyopathies/pathology/prevention & control', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Glucose/administration & dosage/metabolism/pharmacology', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 4/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Myocytes, Cardiac/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/*metabolism', 'Rats']",PMC3609561,,2012/12/12 06:00,2013/05/23 06:00,['2012/12/11 06:00'],"['2012/12/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/12/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/23 06:00 [medline]']","['db12-0533 [pii]', '10.2337/db12-0533 [doi]']",ppublish,Diabetes. 2013 Apr;62(4):1270-81. doi: 10.2337/db12-0533.

However, the mechanisms underlying pathogenesis in MCPyV-negative MCCs remain poorly understood. To nominate genes contributing to the pathogenesis of MCPyV-negative MCCs, we performed DNA microarray analysis on 30 MCCs. The MCPyV status of MCCs was determined by PCR for viral DNA and RNA. A total of 1,593 probe sets were differentially expressed between MCPyV-negative and MCPyV-positive MCCs, with significant differential expression defined as at least a 2-fold change in either direction and a P-value </=0.05. MCPyV-negative tumors showed decreased RB1 expression, whereas MCPyV-positive tumors were enriched for immune response genes. Validation studies included immunohistochemistry demonstration of decreased RB protein expression in MCPyV-negative tumors and increased peritumoral CD8+ T lymphocytes surrounding MCPyV-positive tumors.

Mutations in this meiotic-specific gene have previously been associated with male infertility in humans and recent studies suggest that PRDM9 may be involved in pathological genomic rearrangements. In studying genomes from families with children affected by B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), we characterized meiotic recombination patterns within a family with two siblings having hyperdiploid childhood B-ALL and observed unusual localization of maternal recombination events. The mother of the family carries a rare PRDM9 allele, potentially explaining the unusual patterns found. From exomes sequenced in 44 additional parents of children affected with B-ALL, we discovered a substantial and significant excess of rare allelic forms of PRDM9. The rare PRDM9 alleles are transmitted to the affected children in half the cases; nonetheless there remains a significant excess of rare alleles among patients relative to controls. We successfully replicated this latter observation in an independent cohort of 50 children with B-ALL, where we found an excess of rare PRDM9 alleles in aneuploid and infant B-ALL patients.

We attempted to overcome this limitation and investigate whether the entire process of human T cell development arose similarly to the process in humans, as previously reported. METHODS: To produce an advanced humanized mice model, we transplanted human fetal liver/thymus tissue subrenally and injected human CD34(+) stem cells intravenously into NOD/SCID/IL2Rgamma null (NSG) mice. RESULTS: Humanized mice transplanted with fetal thymus/liver tissues and fetal liver-derived CD34(+) stem cells (FLT+FLCD34) showed higher levels of human cells and T cells than mice transplanted with fetal liver-derived CD34(+) stem cells only (FLCD34). In the transplanted thymus tissue of FLT+FLCD34 mice, thymus seeding progenitors (TSPs), early thymic progenitors (ETPs), pre-T cells, and all the other human T cell populations were identified. In the periphery, FLT+FLCD34 mice have high levels of CD45RA(+) T cells; conversely, FLCD34 mice have higher levels of CD45RO(+) T cells. The CD45RO(+) T cells of FLCD34 mice proliferated rapidly after stimulation and exhibited innate T cells properties, expressing PLZF (promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger protein). CONCLUSION: Human T cells educated by mouse MHC II in mice without a human thymus differ from normal human T cells. On the basis of these findings, numerous T cell-tropic human diseases could be explored in our humanized mice and molecular aspects of human T cell development could be also studied extensively.",,"['Joo, Sung-Yeon', 'Chung, Yun Shin', 'Choi, Bongkum', 'Kim, Miyoung', 'Kim, Jong-Hwa', 'Jun, Tae-Gook', 'Chang, Jun', 'Sprent, Jonathan', 'Surh, Charles D', 'Joh, Jae-won', 'Kim, Sung Joo']","['Joo SY', 'Chung YS', 'Choi B', 'Kim M', 'Kim JH', 'Jun TG', 'Chang J', 'Sprent J', 'Surh CD', 'Joh JW', 'Kim SJ']","['Transplantation Research Center, Samsung Biomedical Research Institute, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Transplantation,Transplantation,0132144,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Il2rg protein, mouse)', '0 (Interleukin Receptor Common gamma Subunit)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '147855-37-6 (ZBTB16 protein, human)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Biomarkers/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cells/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Innate', 'Immunologic Memory', 'Immunophenotyping/methods', 'Interferon-gamma/metabolism', 'Interleukin Receptor Common gamma Subunit/deficiency/genetics', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens/metabolism', '*Liver/embryology/immunology', '*Liver Transplantation', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, SCID', 'Precursor Cells, T-Lymphoid/immunology/transplantation', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/*transplantation', 'Thymocytes/immunology/transplantation', 'Thymus Gland/embryology/immunology/*transplantation', 'Time Factors']",,,2012/12/12 06:00,2013/02/08 06:00,['2012/12/11 06:00'],"['2012/12/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/12/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/08 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/TP.0b013e318270f392 [doi]', '00007890-201212150-00004 [pii]']",ppublish,Transplantation. 2012 Dec 15;94(11):1095-102. doi: 10.1097/TP.0b013e318270f392.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we show a specific type of interaction in which blasts of experimental leukemia destroy the bone marrow (BM) structures and kill stromal cells. The in vitro experiments showed that the cytotoxic agent released by leukemic cells is the fragmented DNA derived from their genome and occurring in nucleosome-like complexes. This DNA entered nuclei of BM or other cells and induced H2A.X phosphorylation at serine 139, similar to double-strand break-inducing agents. There was a correlation between large amounts of acquired DNA and death of recipient cells. Moreover, the DNA integrated into chromosomal DNA of recipient cells. Primary human acute myeloid leukemia cells also released fragmented DNA that penetrated the nuclei of other cells both in vitro and in vivo. We suggest that DNA fragments released from leukemic and also perhaps other types of tumor cells can activate DNA repair mechanisms or death in recipient cells of a tumor microenvironment, depending on the amount of the acquired DNA.

It is sometimes the case that an investigator is studying a population exposed to two agents, X and Y, where Y is the agent of primary interest. Previous research may suggest that the exposures have different effects on the health outcome of interest, one being more harmful than the other. Such information may be derived from epidemiologic analyses; however, in the case where such evidence is unavailable, knowledge can be drawn from toxicologic studies or other experimental research. Unfortunately, using toxicologic findings to develop informative priors in epidemiologic analyses requires strong assumptions, with no established method for its utilization.

Treatment with MTX often causes toxicity, which can necessitate dose reduction or treatment cessation. Interindividual differences in adverse reactions can be due to different factors, including polymorphisms in key genes. Recently, we confirmed the association between SLCO1B1 rs11045879 polymorphism and toxicity previously proposed by Trevino and colleagues. As SLCO1B1 is a transporter involved in MTX elimination, other polymorphisms in genes from this pathway could also have a role in MTX toxicity. The aim of the present study was to analyze in depth the role of polymorphisms in the genes of the MTX transport pathway as putative toxicity predictors in pediatric ALL. METHODS: We analyzed 384 single nucleotide polymorphisms in 12 transporter genes (SLCO1B1, SLCO1B3, SLCO1A2, ABCB1, ABCG2, ABCC1, ABCC2, ABCC3, ABCC4, SLC19A1, SLC22A6 and SLC22A8) and their correlation with different toxicity parameters in 151 pediatric ALL patients treated using the LAL/SHOP protocol. RESULTS: A significant association with MTX plasma levels was found for 21 polymorphisms from seven genes and 15 haplotypes. After correction, rs9516519 in ABCC4, rs3740065 in ABCC2, and haplotype GCGGG in ABCC2 remained significantly associated. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that polymorphisms in ABCC4 and ABCC2 could be novel markers for MTX toxicity in pediatric ALL.",,"['Lopez-Lopez, Elixabet', 'Ballesteros, Javier', 'Pinan, Maria A', 'Sanchez de Toledo, Jose', 'Garcia de Andoin, Nagore', 'Garcia-Miguel, Purificacion', 'Navajas, Aurora', 'Garcia-Orad, Africa']","['Lopez-Lopez E', 'Ballesteros J', 'Pinan MA', 'Sanchez de Toledo J', 'Garcia de Andoin N', 'Garcia-Miguel P', 'Navajas A', 'Garcia-Orad A']","['Department of Genetics, Physical Anthropology and Animal Physiology, University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU), Leioa, Spain.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Pharmacogenet Genomics,Pharmacogenetics and genomics,101231005,"['0 (ABCC2 protein, human)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Protein 2)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*adverse effects/blood', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'Child', 'Female', 'Haplotypes/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/*adverse effects/blood', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Protein 2', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies']",,,2012/12/12 06:00,2013/06/14 06:00,['2012/12/11 06:00'],"['2012/12/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/12/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/FPC.0b013e32835c3b24 [doi]'],ppublish,Pharmacogenet Genomics. 2013 Feb;23(2):53-61. doi: 10.1097/FPC.0b013e32835c3b24.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is the current belief that many of these mutations give a fitness advantage to the mutant population allowing it to expand, eventually leading to disease. However, mutations that lead to such a clonal expansion need not give a fitness advantage and may in fact be neutral--or almost neutral--with respect to fitness. Such mutant clones can be eliminated or expand stochastically, leading to a malignant phenotype (disease). Mutations in haematopoietic stem cells give rise to diseases such as chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) and paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH).

We explored the status of expression and function of TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9 in primary human Langerhans cells (LCs) isolated from cervical tumors. METHODOLOGY: Single-cell suspensions were made from fresh tissues of squamous cell carcinoma (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage IB2); myeloid dendritic cells were purified using CD1c magnetic activated cell separation kits. Langerhans cells were further flow sorted into CD1a*CD207* cells. Acute monocytic leukemia cell line THP-1-derived LCs (moLCs) formed the controls. mRNA from flow-sorted LCs was reverse transcribed to cDNA and TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9 amplified. Monocyte-derived Langerhans cells and cervical tumor LCs were stimulated with TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9 ligands. Culture supernatants were assayed for interleukin (IL) 1beta, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12p70, interferon (IFN) alpha, interferon gamma, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha by Luminex multiplex bead array. Human papillomavirus was genotyped. RESULTS: We have for the first time demonstrated that the acute monocytic leukemia cell line THP-1 can be differentiated into LCs in vitro. Although these moLCs expressed all the 3 TLRs, tumor LCs expressed TLR7 and TLR8, but uniformly lacked TLR9. Also, moLCs secreted IL-6, IL-1beta, and tumor necrosis factor alpha to TLR8 ligand and interferon alpha in response to TLR9 ligand; in contrast, tumor LCs did not express any cytokine to any of the 3 TLR ligands. Human papillomavirus type 16 was one of the common human papillomavirus types in all cases. CONCLUSIONS: Cervical tumor LCs lacked TLR9 expression and were functionally anergic to all the 3: TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9 ligands, which may play a crucial role in immune tolerance. The exact location of block(s) in TLR7 and TLR8 signaling needs to be investigated, which would have important immunotherapeutic implications.",,"['Kumar, Mahesh M', 'Adurthi, Sreenivas', 'Ramachandran, Surya', 'Mukherjee, Geetashree', 'Joy, Omana', 'Krishnamurthy, H', 'Krishna, Sudhir', 'Bafna, U D', 'Uma, Devi K', 'Jayshree, R S']","['Kumar MM', 'Adurthi S', 'Ramachandran S', 'Mukherjee G', 'Joy O', 'Krishnamurthy H', 'Krishna S', 'Bafna UD', 'Uma DK', 'Jayshree RS']","['Department of Microbiology, Kidwai Memorial Institute of Oncology, Bangalore, India.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Int J Gynecol Cancer,International journal of gynecological cancer : official journal of the International Gynecological Cancer Society,9111626,"['0 (Ligands)', '0 (TLR7 protein, human)', '0 (TLR8 protein, human)', '0 (TLR9 protein, human)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 7)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 8)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 9)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Clonal Anergy/drug effects/*genetics/physiology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/physiology', 'Humans', 'Langerhans Cells/drug effects/*metabolism/pathology', 'Ligands', 'Middle Aged', 'Primary Cell Culture', '*Toll-Like Receptor 7/genetics/metabolism/physiology', '*Toll-Like Receptor 8/genetics/metabolism/physiology', '*Toll-Like Receptor 9/genetics/metabolism/physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism/pathology']",,,2012/12/12 06:00,2013/06/06 06:00,['2012/12/11 06:00'],"['2012/12/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/12/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/IGC.0b013e31827a2003 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Gynecol Cancer. 2013 Jan;23(1):184-92. doi: 10.1097/IGC.0b013e31827a2003.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This intrinsic antiviral defense is normally counteracted by ICP0, which allows virus infection to proceed efficiently. Replication of ICP0-null mutant HSV-1, however, is severely repressed by mechanisms that are conferred, at least in part, by nuclear domain 10 (ND10) components, including hDaxx, the promyelocytic leukemia (PML) protein, and Sp100. To investigate if these ND10 components repress viral gene expression in a cooperative manner, we simultaneously depleted host cells for hDaxx, PML, and Sp100 by multiple short hairpin RNA (shRNA) knockdown from a single lentivirus vector. We found that replication and gene expression of ICP0-null mutant HSV-1 were cooperatively repressed by hDaxx, PML, and Sp100 immediately upon infection, and all stages of virus replication were inhibited. Plaque-forming efficiency was enhanced at least 50-fold in the triple-depleted cells, a much larger increase than achieved by depletion of any single ND10 protein. Similar effects were also observed during infection of triple-depleted cells with human cytomegalovirus (HCMV). Moreover, using a cell culture model of quiescent infection, we found that triple depletion resulted in a much larger number of viral genomes escaping repression. However, triple depletion was unable to fully overcome the ICP0-null phenotype, implying the presence of additional repressive host factors, possibly components of the SUMO modification or DNA repair pathways. We conclude that several ND10 components cooperate in an additive manner to regulate HSV-1 and HCMV infection.",,"['Glass, Mandy', 'Everett, Roger D']","['Glass M', 'Everett RD']","['MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research, Glasgow, Scotland, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],['MC_U130169966/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121205,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Antigens, Nuclear)', '0 (Autoantigens)', '0 (Co-Repressor Proteins)', '0 (DAXX protein, human)', '0 (Molecular Chaperones)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '0 (gene 63 protein, Equine herpesvirus 1)', '135844-47-2 (Sp100 protein, human)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']",IM,,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/*metabolism', 'Antigens, Nuclear/*metabolism', 'Autoantigens/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Co-Repressor Proteins', 'Cytomegalovirus/*immunology/physiology', 'Gene Deletion', 'Herpesviridae Infections/*immunology', 'Herpesvirus 1, Human/*immunology/physiology', 'Humans', 'Molecular Chaperones', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*metabolism', 'Viral Plaque Assay', 'Viral Proteins/genetics/metabolism', '*Virus Replication']",PMC3571464,,2012/12/12 06:00,2013/03/23 06:00,['2012/12/11 06:00'],"['2012/12/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/12/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/23 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.02950-12 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.02950-12 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2013 Feb;87(4):2174-85. doi: 10.1128/JVI.02950-12.

Evidence suggests that phosphorylation regulates the functions of ICP0, and three regions (termed regions I, II, and III) in the protein are known to be phosphorylated. Mutation of the putative phosphorylation sites within region I, termed Phos 1, which lies in the N-terminal portion of ICP0, impairs the E3 ubiquitin (Ub) ligase and ND10-disrupting activities of ICP0 in cell culture and diminishes viral replication. To identify the specific phosphorylation site(s) or residues responsible for the phenotypes observed with Phos 1, individual residues within region I were mutated to alanine (S224A, T226A, T231A, and T232A) and one double mutant S224A/T226A was constructed. Tissue culture studies demonstrated that the S224A, S224A/T226A, T231A, and T232A mutants were unable to dissociate the cellular protein PML from ND10 and that the S224/T226A mutant was defective in its ability to dissociate the cellular protein Sp100 from ND10. Additionally, the transactivation activity of ICP0 was impaired in the S224A and S224A/T226A mutants. The S224A and S224A/T226A mutant forms were more stable than wild-type ICP0, suggesting that their ability to autoubiquitinate was limited. Moreover, one ICP0 ubiquitination target, USP-7, was also more stable after infection with these two mutants. Lastly, the replication of the S224A and S224A/T226A mutant viruses was reduced in cell culture and in vivo.

The authors report an interesting case of an IGD-like eruption evolving over the course of MDS with eventual progression to systemic leukemia. IGD is an inflammatory reaction that refers to a varied spectrum of histologic patterns and is associated with a variety of systemic illnesses and hypersensitivity reactions, including lymphoma and leukemia. In patients with MDS, surveillance for leukemia is a critical component of their follow-up care. Normally, this surveillance occurs through serial peripheral blood smears and bone marrow studies.

Cells counteract cell shrinkage by volume regulatory increase (RVI). The present study explored the response of human U937 cells to hypertonic solution thus elucidating the relationship between RVI and AVD. METHODS: Cell water, concentration of monovalent ions and the appearance of apoptotic markers were followed for 0.5-4 h after the cells were transferred to a hypertonic medium. Intracellular water, K+, Na+, and Cl- content, ouabain-sensitive and -resistant Rb+ influxes were determined by measurement of the cell buoyant density in Percoll density gradient, flame emission analysis and 36Cl- assay, respectively. Fluorescent microscopy of live cells stained by acridine orange and ethidium bromide was used to verify apoptosis. RESULTS: After 2-4 h incubation in hypertonic media the cell population was split into light (L) and heavy (H) fractions. According to microscopy and analysis of monovalent ions the majority of cells in the L population were healthy, while the H fractions were enriched with apoptotic cells. The density of L cells was decreasing with time, while the density of H cells was increasing, thus reflecting the opposite effects of RVI and AVD.

In genetically engineered murine models, nullizygosity of Nf1, a tumor suppressor gene that encodes a Ras-GTPase-activating protein, results in hyperactivity of Raf/Mek/Erk in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). Activated Erk1/2 phosphorylate kinases and transcription factors with myriad mitogenic roles in diverse cell types. However, genetic studies examining Erk1/2's differential and/or combined control of normal and Nf1-deficient myelopoiesis are lacking. Moreover, prior studies relying on chemical Mek/Erk inhibitors have reached conflicting conclusions in normal and Nf1-deficient mice. Here, we show that while single Erk1 or Erk2 disruption did not grossly compromise myelopoiesis, dual Erk1/2 disruption rapidly ablated granulocyte and monocyte production in vivo, diminished progenitor cell number, and prevented HSPC proliferation in vitro. Genetic disruption of Erk1/2 in the context of Nf1 nullizygosity (Mx1Cre(+)Nf1(flox/flox)Erk1(-/-)Erk2(flox/flox)) fully protects against the development of MPD.

We characterized the effects of Nf1 loss on immature hematopoietic populations and investigated treatment with the MEK inhibitor PD0325901 (hereafter called 901). Somatic Nf1 inactivation resulted in a marked expansion of immature and lineage-committed myelo-erythroid progenitors and ineffective erythropoiesis. Treatment with 901 induced a durable drop in leukocyte counts, enhanced erythropoietic function, and markedly reduced spleen sizes in mice with MPN. MEK inhibition also restored a normal pattern of erythroid differentiation and greatly reduced extramedullary hematopoiesis. Remarkably, genetic analysis revealed the persistence of Nf1-deficient hematopoietic cells, indicating that MEK inhibition modulates the proliferation and differentiation of Nf1 mutant cells in vivo rather than eliminating them.

It has been well documented that PML (promyelocytic leukemia) enhances viral infectivity and plays a crucial role in antiviral response mechanisms. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the role of PML gene with context to HPV infection in cervical carcinogenesis. METHODS: The expression pattern of PML was analyzed by western blotting and immunohistochemistry in a total of 170 fresh surgically resected cervical tissue specimens comprising precancer (n=12), cancer (n=118) and normal controls (n=40) recruited from PGIMER, Chandigarh, India. HPV status was analyzed by L1 consensus PCR followed by type specific PCR for HR-HPV types 16 and 18 and low risk types 6 and 11. RESULTS: A significant downregulation of PML protein was observed in the majority of cervical cancer and precancer cases 68% (89/130) compared to normal controls. The loss of expression pattern of PML gene was significantly increased with severity of disease both clinically and pathologically (p<0.001). HPV infection was detected in the majority of cancer cases 96% (113/118) and in 83% (10/12) of precancer lesions whereas no infection could be detected in normal controls. Interestingly, all the 68% (89/130) cervical cancer cases that showed downregulation of PML were HPV infected (p=0.0001). CONCLUSION: Taken together, these observations suggest that the downregulation of PML gene and its synergism with HPV infection may play an important role and may serve as a new marker for early diagnosis and therapeutic intervention for cervical carcinogenesis.",['Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

In this study, the effects of some volatile oil components in Humulus lupulus on doxorubicin (DOX) permeability in tumor cells and DOX-induced antitumor activity were examined. In vitro, DOX levels in tumor cells by combined linalool as its component significantly increased in the DOX influx system, and the increased effect by linalool on DOX cytotoxicity was shown. In vivo, the combination of DOX with linalool significantly decreased tumor weight compared with that of DOX alone treated group. The promotion of DOX influx level by combined linalool did not depend on energy, whereas it was suppressed by the absence of Na(+). This promoting effect was suppressed by the presence of S-(4-nitrobenzyl)-6-thioinosine and inhibited dependently on phlorizin concentration. It is considered that linalool promoted DOX influx in tumor cells because of its action on DOX transport through concentrative Na(+)-dependent nucleoside transporter 3, which increased DOX concentration in tumor cells and thus enhanced the antitumor activity of DOX.

An integrated modeling environment was constructed comprising traffic emissions, dispersion models, human exposure models and a coupled internal dose/biology-based dose-response risk assessment model, in order to assess the benzene imposed leukemia risk, as much as the impact of traffic fleet renewal and smoking banning to these levels. Regarding traffic fleet renewal, several ""what if"" scenarios were tested. The detailed full-chain methodology was applied in a South-Eastern European urban setting in Greece and a limited version of the methodology in Helsinki. Non-smoking population runs an average risk equal to 4.1.10(-5) compared to 23.4.10(-5) for smokers. The estimated lifetime risk for the examined occupational groups was higher than the one estimated for the general public by 10-20%. Active smoking constitutes a dominant parameter for benzene-attributable leukemia risk, much stronger than any related activity, occupational or not. From the assessment of mitigation policies it was found that the associated leukemia risk in the optimum traffic fleet scenario could be reduced by up to 85% for non-smokers and up to 8% for smokers. On the contrary, smoking banning provided smaller gains for (7% for non-smokers, 1% for smokers), while for Helsinki, smoking policies were found to be more efficient than traffic fleet renewal. The methodology proposed above provides a general framework for assessing aggregated exposure and the consequent leukemia risk from benzene (incorporating mechanistic data), capturing exposure and internal dosimetry dynamics, translating changes in exposure determinants to actual changes in population risk, providing a valuable tool for risk management evaluation and consequently to policy support.",['Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) coupled with high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-Seq) has become the method of choice to interrogate the genome-wide effect of transcription factors. We have collected and integrated 142 publicly available ChIP-Seq datasets for both normal and leukemic murine blood cell types. In addition, we introduce the new bioinformatic tool Gene Set Control Analysis (GSCA). GSCA predicts likely upstream regulators for lists of genes based on statistical significance of binding event enrichment within the gene loci of a user-supplied gene set. We show that GSCA analysis of lineage-restricted gene sets reveals expected and previously unrecognized candidate upstream regulators. Moreover, application of GSCA to leukemic gene sets allowed us to predict the reactivation of blood stem cell control mechanisms as a likely contributor to LMO2 driven leukemia. It also allowed us to clarify the recent debate on the role of Myc in leukemia stem cell transcriptional programs. As a result, GSCA provides a valuable new addition to analyzing gene sets of interest, complementary to Gene Ontology and Gene Set Enrichment analyses. To facilitate access to the wider research community, we have implemented GSCA as a freely accessible web tool (http://bioinformatics.cscr.cam.ac.uk/GSCA/GSCA.html).","['Copyright (c) 2013 ISEH - Society for Hematology and Stem Cells.

Recently, it was reported that the HCV core protein colocalizes with PML in PML-NBs and abrogates the PML function through interaction with PML. However, role(s) of PML in HCV life cycle is unknown. To test whether or not PML affects HCV life cycle, we examined the level of secreted HCV core and the infectivity of HCV in the culture supernatants as well as the level of HCV RNA in HuH-7-derived RSc cells, in which HCV-JFH1 can infect and efficiently replicate, stably expressing short hairpin RNA targeted to PML. In this context, the level of secreted HCV core and the infectivity in the supernatants from PML knockdown cells was remarkably reduced, whereas the level of HCV RNA in the PML knockdown cells was not significantly affected in spite of very effective knockdown of PML. In fact, we showed that PML is unrelated to HCV RNA replication using the subgenomic HCV-JFH1 replicon RNA, JRN/3-5B. Furthermore, the infectivity of HCV-like particle in the culture supernatants was significantly reduced in PML knockdown JRN/3-5B cells expressing core to NS2 coding region of HCV-JFH1 genome using the trans-packaging system. Finally, we also demonstrated that INI1 and DDX5, the PML-related proteins, are involved in HCV production.

It has been confirmed that increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) under various pathological conditions impairs HSC self-renewal and causes HSC premature exhaustion and BM suppression primarily via induction of HSC senescence, and oncogene induces accumulation of ROS and DNA damage and subsequently cellular senescence, which functions as an important barrier to prevent the growth of transformed cells to form a neoplasia. Here we investigated whether MDS CD34(+) cells enriched with HSC and HPC undergo senescence through accumulation of ROS and DNA damage and their action mechanisms. In this study, the percentages of SA-beta-gal positive senescent CD34(+) cells increased in lower-risk MDS patients, but not in higher-risk MDS and AML patients, compared to that of healthy controls. The increases were associated with an elevated expression of p21 but not the activation of p38. Further study found that there were increased ROS and DNA damage in CD34(+)CD38(-) cells enriched with HSC progression from lower-risk MDS, higher-risk MDS to AML. Therefore, these data suggest that CD34(+) cells from patients with lower-risk MDS present p21 dependent premature senescence, increased accumulation of ROS and DNA damage in CD34(+)CD38(-) cells could contribute to this process; however, CD34(+) cells from patients with higher-risk MDS could develop some mechanisms to uncouple ROS and DNA damage induced senescence.",['Crown Copyright (c) 2012.

METHODS: The meta-analysis included 13 studies and examined the effects of chemotherapy on seven different cognitive domains, across five cancer types. It was the intention of this meta-analysis to stringently exclude many studies, allowing for examination of cognition in carefully selected studies of chemotherapy recipients who do not have current mood or anxiety diagnoses (or psychiatric or substance abuse histories), without brain cancer and who have not had radiotherapy or hormone treatment. A moderator analysis examined whether patient age, treatment duration and time since treatment end significantly contributed to chemotherapy-related cognitive impairment. RESULTS: Evidence for the presence of cognitive impairment following cancer treatment was established for executive function and memory. No relationship was found between cognitive impairment and time since treatment cessation but a significant negative relationship was found for treatment duration. Age had no impact on treatment-related cognitive impairment. CONCLUSIONS: Future research must be conducted on chemotherapy-related cognitive impairment in cancer types such as lymphoma and leukaemia, which have received a moderate amount of attention and colorectal cancer, which has received little attention. This would enable us to determine the extent to which chemotherapy-related cognitive impairment is a universal phenomenon associated with the cancer experience and its treatment regardless of cancer type.",['Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Overexpression of complement inhibitors by many tumor cell types and results obtained in several experimental animal models were all in agreement with this hypothesis. However, recent reports imply that the situation is more complex than initially believed and that under certain circumstances tumor cells may use complement to their own advantage, e.g. by recruitment of suppressor T cells or promoting local angiogenesis. Such a dual role of complement may also be apparent when considering the effect of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAb) used to successfully treat B cell malignancies, such as CD20 mAbs. Some argue that besides direct tumor cell killing by mAbs, two main immune effector mechanisms, complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), may be competing with each other. Experiments aiming at answering the question whether complement is our friend or foe in mAb therapy ended up with seemingly contradictory conclusions.

Collapsing glomerulopathy is a distinct variant of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) that has been attributed to several different causes besides human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in recent years. Previously, anthracycline use has been associated with FSGS, not otherwise specified (NOS). However, in the absence of therapy, various hematolymphoid malignancies have been associated with FSGS, NOS and collapsing glomerulopathy. In individuals who have hematolymphoid malignancy or are being treated with an anthracycline, the frequency of FSGS is extremely low. We suggest that in the following 2 patients, anthracycline use caused collapsing FSGS based on the temporal relationship, but also in the context of potentially underlying predisposing conditions.

Patients were mostly men (n=8), with a median age of 39 years. Patients were initially treated with chemotherapy (n=7) or surgery (n=5). In three patients, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation was performed. During the follow-up period, nine patients died. The median overall survival was 13 months, while event-free survival was 8 months. Regarding initial treatment strategy, no significant difference in overall survival was observed. Both chemotherapy and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation independently improved event-free survival. In addition, patients who received chemotherapy combined with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation had significantly longer event-free survival than those treated with chemotherapy alone. Age<40 years together with chemotherapy/hematopoietic stem cell transplantation significant affected event-free survival.

DESIGN: Experimental study. SETTING: University laboratory. ANIMAL(S): Female rats. INTERVENTION(S): Uteri from brown Norway rats were transplanted to Lewis rats, receiving either tacrolimus or no treatment. Sham groups underwent either hemihysterectomy or tacrolimus treatment. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Gross morphology, histology, density of T-lymphocytes by immunohistochemistry, and mRNA levels of interleukin (IL)-1alpha, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), galectin-1, CD200, IL-15, interferon-inducible protein-10 (IP-10), and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) at 14 days' post-transplantation. RESULT(S): Nontreated uterine grafts showed rejection with necrosis. Sham groups and the tacrolimus-treated transplanted group exhibited normal uterine morphology with low numbers of T-lymphocytes in all uteri except in two out of seven uteri of the tacrolimus-treated transplant group. Uteri of the nontreated transplanted group showed elevated mRNA expression of IL-1alpha and IP-10 and reduced galectin-1, compared with the tacrolimus-treated transplanted group. There was no difference between any groups concerning uterine expression of LIF, NF-kappaB, IL-15, and CD200. CONCLUSION(S): Tacrolimus monotherapy suppresses rejection of an allotransplanted uterus and normalizes the expression of IL-1alpha and IP-10 and prevents T-lymphocyte infiltration.","['Copyright (c) 2013 American Society for Reproductive Medicine.

How Bcr-Abl signalling regulates Nox activity still remains to be elucidated. In this study, using the K562 CML cell line we showed that inhibition of Bcr-Abl signalling, by either Imatinib or Nilotinib, led to a significant reduction in ROS levels which was concurrent with the GSK-3beta dependent, post-translational down-regulation of the small membrane-bound protein p22phox, an essential component of the Nox complex. Furthermore, siRNA knockdown of p22phox in these cells established its importance in ROS production and proliferation.

This study determined the predictors of mortality in a cohort of critically ill patients with hematologic malignancies admitted to the ICU. METHODS: We studied 227 critically ill patients with hematologic malignancies who were admitted to the ICU between April 2009 and December 2011. A cohort of consecutive patients with hematologic malignancies was reviewed retrospectively to identify clinically useful prognostic factors. RESULTS: The ICU mortality rate was 84.1%, and the in-hospital mortality rate was 89.9%. The ICU mortality was significantly higher in patients with acute leukemia than in those with other malignancies. A significant difference between survivors and nonsurvivors was found in neutropenia and its recovery during the ICU stay, presence of cardiac dysfunction, the need for an invasive mechanical ventilator, use of inotropic/vasopressor agents, platelet count, aspartate transaminase level, pH, and Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation II score. In the multivariate analysis, acute leukemia, need for invasive mechanical ventilator, use of inotropic/vasopressor agents, and Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation II scores were independently associated with a worse outcome in patients with hematologic malignancies admitted to the ICU. CONCLUSION: Higher mortality in patients with hematologic malignancies admitted to the ICU is associated with more severe illness, as reflected by higher organ failure scores or respiratory or hemodynamic instability. Mortality is higher in patients with acute leukemia as compared with other hematologic malignancies.",['Crown Copyright (c) 2012. Published by Elsevier Inc.

The two viruses encode transactivator proteins, Tax-1 and Tax-2 respectively. In ATL, Tax-1 is thought to play a central role in the transformation of a normal T-cell into a leukemic cell; however, it has not been entirely clear how post-translational modifications of Tax-1 influence its transforming activity.

HTLV-1 is associated with Adult T cell Leukemia (ATL), whereas infection by HTLV-2 has no association with neoplasia. Transformation of T lymphocytes by HTLV-1 is linked to the capacity of its oncoprotein Tax-1 to alter cell survival and cell cycle control mechanisms. Among these functions, Tax-1-mediated activation of cellular gene expression via the NF-kappaB pathway depends on Tax-1 post-translational modifications by ubiquitination and sumoylation. The Tax-2 protein of HTLV-2B (Tax-2B) is also modified by ubiquitination and sumoylation and activates the NF-kappaB pathway to a level similar to that of Tax-1. The present study aims to understand whether ubiquitination and sumoylation modifications are involved in Tax-2B-mediated activation of the NF-kappaB pathway. RESULTS: The comparison of Tax-1 and Tax-2B lysine to arginine substitution mutants revealed conserved patterns and levels of ubiquitination with notable difference in the lysine usage for sumoylation. Neither Tax-1 nor Tax-2B ubiquitination and sumoylation deficient mutants could activate the NF-kappaB pathway and fusion of ubiquitin or SUMO-1 to the C-terminus of the ubiquitination and sumoylation deficient Tax-2B mutant strikingly restored transcriptional activity. In addition, ubiquitinated forms of Tax-2B colocalized with RelA and IKKgamma in prominent cytoplasmic structures associated with the Golgi apparatus, whereas colocalization of Tax-2B with the RelA subunit of NF-kappaB and the transcriptional coactivator p300 in punctate nuclear structures was dependent on Tax-2B sumoylation, as previously observed for Tax-1. CONCLUSIONS: Both Tax-1 and Tax-2 activate the NF-kappaB pathway via similar mechanisms involving ubiquitination and sumoylation. Therefore, the different transforming potential of HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 is unlikely to be related to different modes of activation of the canonical NF-kappaB pathway.",,"['Turci, Marco', 'Lodewick, Julie', 'Di Gennaro, Gianfranco', 'Rinaldi, Anne Sophie', 'Marin, Oriano', 'Diani, Erica', 'Sampaio, Carla', 'Bex, Francoise', 'Bertazzoni, Umberto', 'Romanelli, Maria Grazia']","['Turci M', 'Lodewick J', 'Di Gennaro G', 'Rinaldi AS', 'Marin O', 'Diani E', 'Sampaio C', 'Bex F', 'Bertazzoni U', 'Romanelli MG']","['Department of Life and Reproduction Sciences, Section of Biology and Genetics, University of Verona, Strada Le Grazie 8, 37134, Verona, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121207,England,Retrovirology,Retrovirology,101216893,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (E1A-Associated p300 Protein)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (EP300 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (I-kappa B Kinase)']",IM,,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Conserved Sequence', 'E1A-Associated p300 Protein/metabolism', 'Gene Products, tax/*metabolism', 'HEK293 Cells', 'HeLa Cells', 'Host-Pathogen Interactions', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*physiology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 2/*physiology', 'Humans', 'I-kappa B Kinase/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Protein Transport', '*Sumoylation', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Ubiquitination']",PMC3543174,,2012/12/12 06:00,2013/06/12 06:00,['2012/12/11 06:00'],"['2012/04/18 00:00 [received]', '2012/11/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/12/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/12/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/12 06:00 [medline]']","['1742-4690-9-102 [pii]', '10.1186/1742-4690-9-102 [doi]']",epublish,Retrovirology. 2012 Dec 7;9:102. doi: 10.1186/1742-4690-9-102.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVES: To establish a common international consensus addressing practical, clinically relevant questions in this setting. METHODS: An international consensus working group of experts was set up to develop guidelines according to an evidence-based medicine approach, using the GRADE system. RESULTS: For the initial treatment of established VTE: low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) is recommended [1B]; fondaparinux and unfractionated heparin (UFH) can be also used [2D]; thrombolysis may only be considered on a case-by-case basis [Best clinical practice (Guidance)]; vena cava filters (VCF) may be considered if contraindication to anticoagulation or pulmonary embolism recurrence under optimal anticoagulation; periodic reassessment of contraindications to anticoagulation is recommended and anticoagulation should be resumed when safe; VCF are not recommended for primary VTE prophylaxis in cancer patients [Guidance]. For the early maintenance (10 days to 3 months) and long-term (beyond 3 months) treatment of established VTE, LMWH for a minimum of 3 months is preferred over vitamin K antagonists (VKA) [1A]; idraparinux is not recommended [2C]; after 3-6 months, LMWH or VKA continuation should be based on individual evaluation of the benefit-risk ratio, tolerability, patient preference and cancer activity [Guidance]. For the treatment of VTE recurrence in cancer patients under anticoagulation, three options can be considered: (i) switch from VKA to LMWH when treated with VKA; (ii) increase in LMWH dose when treated with LMWH, and (iii) VCF insertion [Guidance]. For the prophylaxis of postoperative VTE in surgical cancer patients, use of LMWH o.d. or low dose of UFH t.i.d. is recommended; pharmacological prophylaxis should be started 12-2 h preoperatively and continued for at least 7-10 days; there are no data allowing conclusion that one type of LMWH is superior to another [1A]; there is no evidence to support fondaparinux as an alternative to LMWH [2C]; use of the highest prophylactic dose of LMWH is recommended [1A]; extended prophylaxis (4 weeks) after major laparotomy may be indicated in cancer patients with a high risk of VTE and low risk of bleeding [2B]; the use of LMWH for VTE prevention in cancer patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery may be recommended as for laparotomy [Guidance]; mechanical methods are not recommended as monotherapy except when pharmacological methods are contraindicated [2C]. For the prophylaxis of VTE in hospitalized medical patients with cancer and reduced mobility, we recommend prophylaxis with LMWH, UFH or fondaparinux [1B]; for children and adults with acute lymphocytic leukemia treated with l-asparaginase, depending on local policy and patient characteristics, prophylaxis may be considered in some patients [Guidance]; in patients receiving chemotherapy, prophylaxis is not recommended routinely [1B]; primary pharmacological prophylaxis of VTE may be indicated in patients with locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic [1B] or lung [2B] cancer treated with chemotherapy and having a low risk of bleeding; in patients treated with thalidomide or lenalidomide combined with steroids and/or chemotherapy, VTE prophylaxis is recommended; in this setting, VKA at low or therapeutic doses, LMWH at prophylactic doses and low-dose aspirin have shown similar effects; however, the efficacy of these regimens remains unclear [2C]. Special situations include brain tumors, severe renal failure (CrCl<30 mL min(-1) ), thrombocytopenia and pregnancy. Guidances are provided in these contexts.

This study examined the expression and methylation of the PLA2R1 gene in Jurkat and U937 leukemic cell lines and its methylation in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute leukemia. METHODS: Sites of methylation of the PLA2R1 locus were identified by sequencing bisulfite-modified DNA fragments. Methylation specific-high resolution melting (MS-HRM) analysis was then carried out to quantify PLA2R1 methylation at 5'-CpG sites identified with differences in methylation between healthy control subjects and leukemic patients using sequencing of bisulfite-modified genomic DNA. RESULTS: Expression of PLA2R1 was found to be completely down-regulated in Jurkat and U937 cells, accompanied by complete methylation of PLA2R1 promoter and down-stream regions; PLA2R1 was re-expressed after exposure of cells to 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine. MS-HRM analysis of the PLA2R1 locus in patients with different types of leukemia indicated an average methylation of 28.9% +/- 17.8%, compared to less than 9% in control subjects. In MDS patients the extent of PLA2R1 methylation significantly increased with disease risk. Furthermore, measurements of PLA2R1 methylation appeared useful for predicting responsiveness to the methyltransferase inhibitor, azacitidine, as a pre-emptive treatment to avoid hematological relapse in patients with high-risk MDS or acute myeloid leukemia. CONCLUSIONS: The study shows for the first time that PLA2R1 gene sequences are a target of hypermethylation in leukemia, which may have pathophysiological relevance for disease evolution in MDS and leukemogenesis.",,"['Menschikowski, Mario', 'Platzbecker, Uwe', 'Hagelgans, Albert', 'Vogel, Margot', 'Thiede, Christian', 'Schonefeldt, Claudia', 'Lehnert, Renate', 'Eisenhofer, Graeme', 'Siegert, Gabriele']","['Menschikowski M', 'Platzbecker U', 'Hagelgans A', 'Vogel M', 'Thiede C', 'Schonefeldt C', 'Lehnert R', 'Eisenhofer G', 'Siegert G']","['Institut fur Klinische Chemie und Laboratoriumsmedizin, Technische Universitat Dresden, Fetscherstrasse 74, D-01307, Dresden, Germany.

In silico analysis of testis genes containing a consensus hypoxia response element (HRE, 5'-RCGTG-3') identified myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1) as a potential HIF-1 target gene. The purpose of this study was to determine whether HIF-1 shows DNA-binding activity in normoxic and ischemic testes and whether Mcl-1 is a target gene of testicular HIF-1. METHODS: The testicular HIF-1 DNA-binding capacity was analyzed in vitro using a quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA). MCL-1 protein expression was evaluated by immunoblot analysis and immunohistochemistry. The binding of testicular HIF-1 to the Mcl-1 gene was examined via chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis. RESULTS: The ELISA and EMSA assays demonstrated that testicular HIF-1 from normoxic and ischemic testes binds DNA equally strongly, suggesting physiological roles for HIF-1 in the normoxic testis, unlike most tissues in which HIF-1 is degraded under normoxic conditions and is only activated by hypoxia. MCL-1 protein was determined to be abundant in both normoxic and ischemic testes and expressed in Leydig cells. In a pattern identical to that of HIF-1 expression, the steady-state levels of MCL-1 were not significantly affected by I or I/R and MCL-1 co-localized with HIF-1alpha in Leydig cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis using a HIF-1 antibody revealed sequences enriched for the Mcl-1 promoter. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrated that, unlike what is observed in most tissues, HIF-1 displays DNA-binding activity in both normoxic and ischemic testes, and Mcl-1 may be a key target gene of testicular HIF-1 with potential roles in the antiapoptotic protection of Leydig cells.",,"['Palladino, Michael A', 'Shah, Anoop', 'Tyson, Rebecca', 'Horvath, Jaclyn', 'Dugan, Christine', 'Karpodinis, Marie']","['Palladino MA', 'Shah A', 'Tyson R', 'Horvath J', 'Dugan C', 'Karpodinis M']","['Department of Biology, Monmouth University, 400 Cedar Avenue, West Long Branch, NJ 07764, USA. mpalladi@monmouth.edu']",['eng'],['R15-HD046451/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20121205,England,Reprod Biol Endocrinol,Reproductive biology and endocrinology : RB&E,101153627,"['0 (Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1)', '0 (Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Hypoxia', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'DNA/metabolism', 'Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1/*analysis/*metabolism', 'Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit/analysis', 'Immunoblotting', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Ischemia/metabolism', 'Leydig Cells/chemistry', 'Male', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/analysis/*genetics', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Testis/blood supply/*chemistry']",PMC3556106,,2012/12/12 06:00,2013/07/03 06:00,['2012/12/11 06:00'],"['2012/08/08 00:00 [received]', '2012/11/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/12/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/12/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/03 06:00 [medline]']","['1477-7827-10-104 [pii]', '10.1186/1477-7827-10-104 [doi]']",epublish,Reprod Biol Endocrinol. 2012 Dec 5;10:104. doi: 10.1186/1477-7827-10-104.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This makes tyrosine kinase FLT3 a highly attractive target for therapeutic drug development. However, effective drugs have not yet emerged. This study is intended to identify and to characterize new FLT3 inhibitors. METHODS: By using the protein substrate GST-FLT3S to analyze kinase activity of recombinant proteins carrying the catalytic domain of wild type and mutant forms of FLT3, we screened a chemical library containing 80 known protein kinase inhibitors. We identified SU11652 as a potent FLT3 inhibitor and further employed FLT3-ITD-positive MV- 4-11 cells to study its effects on cell growth, apoptosis, cell cycles, and cell signaling. RESULTS: SU11652 strongly inhibited the activity of wild type, D835Y, and D835H mutant forms of FLT3 with IC50 values of 1.5, 16, and 32 nM, respectively. It effectively blocked the growth of FLT3-ITD -positive MV-4-11 cells at nanomolar concentrations but exhibited much less effects on several other cells which do not carry mutations of FLT3. SU11652 inhibited growth of MV-4-11 cells by inducing apoptosis, causing cell cycle arrest, and blocking activation of the ERK, Akt, and STAT signaling pathways. CONCLUSION: SU11652 is a potent FLT3 inhibitor which selectively targets FLT3-ITD-positive cells. It should serve as a good candidate for development of therapeutic drugs to treat AML.",,"['Guo, Yao', 'Chen, Yun', 'Xu, Xuesong', 'Fu, Xueqi', 'Zhao, Zhizhuang Joe']","['Guo Y', 'Chen Y', 'Xu X', 'Fu X', 'Zhao ZJ']","['Edmond H, Fischer Signal Transduction Laboratory, College of Life Sciences, Jilin University, Changchun, China.']",['eng'],"['HL079441/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL094591/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121206,England,J Hematol Oncol,Journal of hematology & oncology,101468937,"['0 (Indoles)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrroles)', '0 (SU 11652)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,,"['Cell Growth Processes/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'Indoles/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/enzymology/pathology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Pyrroles/*pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism']",PMC3524753,,2012/12/12 06:00,2013/06/26 06:00,['2012/12/11 06:00'],"['2012/10/24 00:00 [received]', '2012/11/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/12/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/12/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/26 06:00 [medline]']","['1756-8722-5-72 [pii]', '10.1186/1756-8722-5-72 [doi]']",epublish,J Hematol Oncol. 2012 Dec 6;5:72. doi: 10.1186/1756-8722-5-72.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bovine leukocyte antigen (BoLA) is strongly involved in the subclinical progression of BLV infections. Recent studies show that the BoLA-DRB3 gene might play a direct role in controlling the number of BLV-infected peripheral B lymphocytes in vivo in Holstein cattle. However, the specific BoLA class II allele and DRB3-DQA1 haplotypes determining the BLV proviral load in Japanese Black cattle are yet to be identified. In this study, we focused on the association of BLV proviral load and polymorphism of BoLA class II in Japanese Black cattle. We genotyped 186 BLV-infected, clinically normal cattle for BoLA-DRB3 and BoLA-DQA1 using a polymerase chain reaction-sequence-based typing method. BoLA-DRB3*0902 and BoLA-DRB3*1101 were associated with a low proviral load (LPVL), and BoLA-DRB3*1601 was associated with a high proviral load (HPVL). Furthermore, BoLA-DQA1*0204 and BoLA-DQA1*10012 were related to LPVL and HPVL, respectively. Furthermore, we confirmed the correlation between the DRB3-DQA1 haplotype and BLV proviral load. Two haplotypes, namely 0902B or C (DRB3*0902-DQA1*0204) and 1101A (DRB3*1101-DQA1*10011), were associated with a low BLV proviral load, whereas one haplotype 1601B (DRB3*1601-DQA1*10012) was associated with a high BLV proviral load. We conclude that resistance is a dominant trait and susceptibility is a recessive trait. Additionally, resistant alleles were common between Japanese Black and Holstein cattle, and susceptible alleles differed.

Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) is often recommended for these children but the benefit is unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate survival for poor response AML patients treated with SCT. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Treatment was given according to the NOPHO-AML 2004 protocol. All patients received AIET (Cytarabine, Idarubicin, Etoposide, Thioguanine) and AM (Cytarabine, Mitoxantrone) as induction. We included poor response defined as > 15% blasts on day 15 after AIET (n = 17) or > 5% blasts after AM (n = 14, refractory disease). Poor response patients received intensively timed induction and proceeded to SCT when a donor was available. RESULTS: Thirty-one of 267 evaluable patients (12%) had a poor response. SCT was performed in 25; using matched unrelated donors in 13, matched sibling donors in 6, cord blood donor in 4, and haploidentical donor in two. The median follow-up for the 31 poor responding patients was 2.6 years (range 0.4 - 8.1 years) and 3-year probability of survival 70% (95% CI 59-77%).

The present study aimed to investigate the influence of GST-M1 and GST-T1 deletions on clinical outcome of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia treated according to the AIEOP-BFM ALL 2000 study protocol. MATERIALS & METHODS: A novel-design, two-phase study was applied to select a subsample of 614 children to be genotyped for the deletions of GST genes. Cumulative incidence of relapse was then estimated by weighted Kaplan-Meier analysis, and the Cox model was applied to evaluate the effect of GST-M1 and GST-T1 isoenzyme deletions on relapse.

METHODS: They reviewed the senior author's database of surgically treated cavernous malformations of the brain to identify those patients whose cavernous malformations developed after cranial radiation during treatment for ALL. The medical records of these patients were reviewed to determine their clinical presentation, radiological findings, and outcome at long-term follow-up. RESULTS: Five patients fulfilled the specified criteria over a 23-year period. At the time of ALL diagnosis, they were all 4-5 years old. The cerebral cavernous malformations developed 2-8 years after cranial radiation, and 4 of the 5 patients presented with neurological symptoms, which ranged from focal deficits to seizures. Two patients required a second craniotomy, one from lesion recurrence possibly due to incomplete resection, and another for a second cavernous malformation, which developed at another site 6 years after the initial malformation was excised. Long-term follow-up of 2, 10, 11, 11, and 17 years has revealed no additional lesion development or recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: Symptomatic cavernous malformations of the brain may develop several years after chemotherapy and cranial radiation treatment for ALL, and the clinical course of these cavernous malformations may be more aggressive than that of the typical post-radiation lesions seen in other conditions. Long-term clinical and imaging monitoring is recommended for children who have undergone treatment for ALL.

The samples from three medicinal cultivars significantly differed in the quality and quantity of flavonoid aglycones and glycosides compared with those from two edible cultivars, which allows the possibility of showing the chemical distinctness of these cultivars and may be useful in their standardization. Moreover, the antiallergic effects of these cultivars were comparatively assayed for the first time. A representative medicinal cultivar, 'huaiju', showed potential activity on the inhibition of antigen-induced degranulation from RBL-2H3 cells and compound 48/80-induced scratching in mice, whereas the in vitro and in vivo antiallergic activities of two edible cultivars were weak.

Through chromatin remodeling, the HTLV-1 transactivator protein Tax interacts with cellular factors at the chromosomally integrated viral promoter to activate downstream genes and control viral transcription. RNA interference is the host innate defense mechanism mediated by short RNA species (siRNA or miRNA) that regulate gene expression. There exists a close collaborative functioning of cellular transcription factors with miRNA in order to regulate the expression of a number of eukaryotic genes including those involved in suppression of cell growth, induction of apoptosis, as well as repressing viral replication and propagation. In addition, it has been suggested that retroviral latency is influenced by chromatin alterations brought about by miRNA. Since Tax requires the assembly of transcriptional cofactors to carry out viral gene expression, there might be a close association between miRNA influencing chromatin alterations and Tax-mediated LTR activation.

The success of ATRA in differentiation therapy of APL is well known. However, ATRA does not work in non-APL AML.

The present paper is focused on the studies aimed at defining the viral genetic determinants of the pathobiology of HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 through a comparison of the expression strategies and functional properties of the different gene products of the two viruses.",,"['Rende, Francesca', 'Cavallari, Ilaria', 'Romanelli, Maria Grazia', 'Diani, Erica', 'Bertazzoni, Umberto', 'Ciminale, Vincenzo']","['Rende F', 'Cavallari I', 'Romanelli MG', 'Diani E', 'Bertazzoni U', 'Ciminale V']","['Department of Oncology and Surgical Sciences, The University of Padova, 35128 Padova, Italy.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20111229,United States,Leuk Res Treatment,Leukemia research and treatment,101591812,,,,,PMC3504254,,2012/12/06 06:00,2012/12/06 06:01,['2012/12/06 06:00'],"['2011/09/09 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/12/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/12/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/06 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2012/876153 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Res Treatment. 2012;2012:876153. doi: 10.1155/2012/876153.

Ligated VDR in complex with retinoid X receptor (RXR) binds to regulatory regions of 1,25(OH)(2)D-target genes. 1,25(OH)(2)D is able to induce differentiation of leukemic blasts towards macrophage-like cells. Many different acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines respond to 1,25(OH)(2)D by increasing CD14 cell surface receptor, some additionally upregulate CD11b and CD11c integrins. In untreated AML cells VDR protein is present in cytosol at a very low level, even though its mRNA is continuously expressed. Ligation of VDR causes protein stabilization and translocation to the cell nuclei, where it regulates transcription of target genes. Several important groups of genes are regulated by 1,25(OH)(2)D in HL60 cells. These genes include differentiation-related genes involved in macrophage function, as well as a gene regulating degradation of 1,25(OH)(2)D, namely CYP24A1. We summarize here the data which demonstrate that though some cellular responses to 1,25(OH)(2)D in AML cells are transcription-dependent, there are many others which depend on intracellular signal transduction, protein trafficking and stabilization.

We evaluated both immune and nonimmune effects of cetuximab (anti-ERBB1 Mab), trastuzumab (anti-ERBB2 Mab), pertuzumab (anti-ERBB2 Mab), and lapatinib (dual ERBB1 and ERBB2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor) in a large well-characterized panel of 64 CRC cell lines to find response predictive tumor characteristics. There was a significant correlation between the direct effects of cetuximab and lapatinib. Both agents were associated (P = 0.0004) with ""triple' wild-type status in KRAS, BRAF, and PIK3CA exon 20. Most cell lines were resistant to the direct effects of anti-ERBB2 Mabs, suggesting that the effects of lapatinib might mainly be through ERBB1. Microarray mRNA expression profiles of sensitive and resistant cell lines showed that although ERBB1 receptor or ligand levels did not associate with cetuximab sensitivity, high levels of ERBB2 (P = 0.036) and amphiregulin (P = 0.026) predicted sensitivity to lapatinib. However, higher ERBB1 expression predicted susceptibility to cetuximab-induced antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and occurred independently of KRAS/BRAF/PIK3CA mutations (P = 0.69). Lapatinib may be an effective alternative therapy to cetuximab in triple wild-type tumors. Microarray analysis provides suggestive biomarkers for resistance. ERBB1 levels, independent of mutation status, predict immune killing. Therefore, anti-ERBB1 antibodies may be considered in CRC tumors with higher ERBB1 expression and favorable FcgammaR polymorphisms.",,"['Ashraf, Shazad Q', 'Nicholls, Angela M', 'Wilding, Jennifer L', 'Ntouroupi, Triantafyllia G', 'Mortensen, Neil J', 'Bodmer, Walter F']","['Ashraf SQ', 'Nicholls AM', 'Wilding JL', 'Ntouroupi TG', 'Mortensen NJ', 'Bodmer WF']","['Cancer and Immunogenetics Laboratory, Department of Oncology, Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, Oxford OX3 9DS, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121203,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Quinazolines)', '0VUA21238F (Lapatinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (EGFR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)', 'K16AIQ8CTM (pertuzumab)', 'P188ANX8CK (Trastuzumab)', 'PQX0D8J21J (Cetuximab)']",IM,,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cetuximab', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/*metabolism', 'ErbB Receptors/*metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genes, ras', 'Humans', 'Immune System', 'Lapatinib', 'Models, Genetic', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Quinazolines/pharmacology', 'Trastuzumab']",PMC3529069,,2012/12/06 06:00,2013/03/01 06:00,['2012/12/06 06:00'],"['2012/12/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/12/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/01 06:00 [medline]']","['1218750110 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1218750110 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2012 Dec 18;109(51):21046-51. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1218750110.

We describe the development and characterization of a fully human antibody to CXCR4 and its application for therapy of AML, non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), chronic lymphoid leukemia (CLL), and multiple myeloma. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Human transgenic mice were immunized with CXCR4-expressing cells, and antibodies reactive with CXCR4 were analyzed for apoptosis induction and ability to interfere with CXCL12-induced migration and calcium flux. In vivo efficacy was determined in multiple AML, NHL, and multiple myeloma xenograft tumors in severe combined immunodeficient mice. RESULTS: BMS-936564/MDX-1338 is a fully human IgG(4) monoclonal antibody that specifically recognizes human CXCR4. In vitro studies show that MDX-1338 binds to CXCR4-expressing cells with low nanomolar affinity, blocks CXCL12 binding to CXCR4-expressing cells, and inhibits CXCL12-induced migration and calcium flux with low nanomolar EC(50) values. When given as monotherapy, MDX-1338 exhibits antitumor activity in established tumors including AML, NHL, and multiple myeloma xenograft models. In addition, we show that MDX-1338 induced apoptosis on a panel of cell lines and propose that antibody-induced apoptosis is one of the mechanisms of tumor growth inhibition. CONCLUSIONS: BMS-936564/MDX-1338 is a potent CXCR4 antagonist which is efficacious as monotherapy in tumor-bearing mice and is currently in phase I for the treatment of relapsed/refractory AML, NHL, CLL, and multiple myeloma.",['(c)2012 AACR.'],"['Kuhne, Michelle R', 'Mulvey, Tanya', 'Belanger, Blake', 'Chen, Sharline', 'Pan, Chin', 'Chong, Colin', 'Cao, Fei', 'Niekro, Wafa', 'Kempe, Tom', 'Henning, Karla A', 'Cohen, Lewis J', 'Korman, Alan J', 'Cardarelli, Pina M']","['Kuhne MR', 'Mulvey T', 'Belanger B', 'Chen S', 'Pan C', 'Chong C', 'Cao F', 'Niekro W', 'Kempe T', 'Henning KA', 'Cohen LJ', 'Korman AJ', 'Cardarelli PM']","['Department of Cell Biology and Physiology, BDC, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Lawrenceville, New Jersey, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20121204,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL12)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)', '7KNP87L4X4 (ulocuplumab)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*pharmacology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chemokine CXCL12/immunology/metabolism', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/drug therapy/*immunology/pathology', 'Humans', 'Ligands', 'Mice', 'Receptors, CXCR4/antagonists & inhibitors/*immunology/metabolism', 'Tumor Burden/drug effects', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,,2012/12/06 06:00,2013/07/05 06:00,['2012/12/06 06:00'],"['2012/12/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/12/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/05 06:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-12-2333 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-12-2333 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2013 Jan 15;19(2):357-66. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-12-2333.

From the extract of A. japonica, three major sesquiterpene derivatives including atractylenolide I, atractylenolide III and eudesma-4,7-dien-8-one were successfully isolated. Among these compounds, only atractylenolide I was shown to strongly inhibit 5-LOX from RBL-1 cells (IC(50) = 18.6 muM). To evaluate the effects of experimental AD, the ethanol extract of A. japonica (200 mg/day) was administered orally to hapten-treated NC/Nga mice which is an animal model of AD. It was firstly found that the extract significantly inhibited AD-like symptoms in mice, as judged by severity score and scratching behavior.

Despite intensive effort by many laboratories, the putative myeloid tumor suppressor(s) on chromosome 7 has not yet been identified.We performed transcriptome sequencing and SNP array analysis on de novo and therapy-related myeloid neoplasms, half with -7/del(7q). We identified a 2.17-Mb commonly deleted segment on chromosome band 7q22.1 containing CUX1, a gene encoding a homeodomain-containing transcription factor. In 1 case, CUX1 was disrupted by a translocation, resulting in a loss-of-function RNA fusion transcript. CUX1 was the most significantly differentially expressed gene within the commonly deleted segment and was expressed at haploinsufficient levels in -7/del(7q) leukemias. Haploinsufficiency of the highly conserved ortholog, cut, led to hemocyte overgrowth and tumor formation in Drosophila melanogaster.

To study the molecular and functional response of primary murine hematopoietic progenitor cells to the activation of Evi1, we established an inducible lentiviral expression system. EVI1 had a biphasic effect with initial growth inhibition and retarded myeloid differentiation linked to enhanced survival of myeloblasts in long-term cultures.

Imatinib administration subsequent to SCT may prevent relapse, but the role of scheduling and its impact on outcome are not known. In a prospective, randomized multicenter trial, we compared the tolerability and efficacy of post-transplant imatinib administered either prophylactically (arm A; n=26) or following detection of MRD (arm B; n=29). Prophylactic imatinib significantly reduced the incidence of molecular recurrence after SCT compared with MRD-triggered imatinib (40% vs 69%; P=0.046). Median duration of PCR negativity was 26.5 and 6.8 months, respectively (P=0.065). Five-year survival in both interventional groups was high (80 and 74.5%), despite premature discontinuation of imatinib in the majority of patients because of poor tolerability. Relapse probability was significantly higher in patients who became MRD positive (P=0.017). In conclusion, post-transplant imatinib results in a low relapse rate, durable remissions and excellent long-term outcome in patients with BCR-ABL1-positive ALL irrespective of whether it is given prophylactically or MRD-triggered.

We report a case in a 2-year-old boy who was initially diagnosed at 8 months of age with atypical cutaneous mastocytoma of the right ear with subsequent aggressive, destructive growth pattern; features that were most consistent with MCS. So far, MCS has been documented in the literature in at least 6 human cases. To the best of our knowledge, our case represents the first MCS in an infant. Thorough multimodal approach with strict follow-up is relevant in appropriately diagnosing this rare entity, particularly in differentiating this lesion from other neoplasms that are more likely to occur in infancy.",,"['Bautista-Quach, Marnelli A', 'Booth, Cassie L', 'Kheradpour, Albert', 'Zuppan, Craig W', 'Rowsell, Edward H', 'Weiss, Lawrence', 'Wang, Jun']","['Bautista-Quach MA', 'Booth CL', 'Kheradpour A', 'Zuppan CW', 'Rowsell EH', 'Weiss L', 'Wang J']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Loma Linda, CA 92354, USA. jwang@llu.edu']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,,IM,,"['Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Mast-Cell Sarcoma/*diagnosis/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas']",,,2012/12/06 06:00,2013/06/08 06:00,['2012/12/06 06:00'],"['2012/12/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/12/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/MPH.0b013e318279e392 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2013 May;35(4):315-20. doi: 10.1097/MPH.0b013e318279e392.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Obesity, for which survivors of ALL and lymphoma are also at risk, may further exacerbate these problems. This pilot study evaluates changes in physical activity and body composition among children being treated for ALL and lymphoma and their parents. PROCEDURES: Recently diagnosed adolescent ALL and lymphoma patients were recruited from 2 pediatric hematology and oncology clinics, and matched on age, race, and sex to healthy individuals in the community. Changes in diet, physical activity, and body composition were collected at baseline, 6, and 12 months. RESULTS: All children (n=15) were, on average, 10.3 years of age at enrollment, and were fairly evenly distributed with regard to sex. Analyses revealed a significant difference between cases and controls with respect to the change in body mass index from baseline to 12 months (P=0.01). In addition, controls demonstrated a significantly greater increase in moderate-vigorous physical activity than the cases [229.8 metabolic equivalent of tasks (METs) vs. 23.5 METs]; indicating cases remained fairly inactive over the course of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Our data corroborate previous findings that following treatment for ALL and lymphoma, childhood cancer survivors tend to be less active and at greater risk for obesity than their healthy peers. The present study, which assessed cases prospectively over a 12-month period during the early phases of treatment, extends prior reports by demonstrating that these outcomes are evident at an early stage in treatment.",,"['Fuemmeler, Bernard F', 'Pendzich, Margaret K', 'Clark, Kalin', 'Lovelady, Cheryl', 'Rosoff, Philip', 'Blatt, Julie', 'Demark-Wahnefried, Wendy']","['Fuemmeler BF', 'Pendzich MK', 'Clark K', 'Lovelady C', 'Rosoff P', 'Blatt J', 'Demark-Wahnefried W']","['Department of Community and Family Medicine, DUMC, Durham, NC 27710, USA. bernard.fuemmeler@duke.edu']",['eng'],"['K07 CA124905/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1K07CA124905/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Anthropometry', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', '*Body Composition', 'Body Mass Index', 'Child', '*Diet', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma/*complications/drug therapy', 'Male', '*Motor Activity', 'Pilot Projects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications/drug therapy', 'Survivors/*statistics & numerical data']",PMC3606649,['NIHMS422302'],2012/12/06 06:00,2013/09/26 06:00,['2012/12/06 06:00'],"['2012/12/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/12/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/MPH.0b013e318279cd3e [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2013 Aug;35(6):437-43. doi: 10.1097/MPH.0b013e318279cd3e.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Type I CD20 antibodies rituximab and ofatumumab are known to bind to different epitopes. The differences suggest that the biological properties of these antibodies are not solely determined by their core epitope sequences, but also depend on other factors, such as the elbow hinge angle, the orientation of the bound antibody and differential effects mediated by the Fc region of the antibody.

A decade of experience at a single institution.,539-47,10.1097/PAS.0b013e318272c62a [doi],"Histopathology assessment is crucial for the diagnosis of graft versus host disease (GVHD), as the presence of crypt apoptosis is the cardinal criterion required. However, crypt apoptosis is not limited to GVHD; it also occurs in other conditions such as infection, drug reaction, or inflammatory reactions unrelated to GVHD. To better determine whether the presence of 6 or fewer apoptotic bodies is sufficient for the diagnosis of GVHD, we retrospectively reviewed 78 colon biopsies from 66 patients who received either hematopoietic stem cell (HSCT) or cord blood cell transplantation and whose colon biopsies exhibited apoptotic bodies. Among them, 41 cases contained 6 or fewer apoptotic bodies in the colon biopsy. These biopsies were compared with 141 colon biopsy controls that showed no significant pathologic changes as well as 16 colon biopsies with cytomegalovirus colitis from patients without a history of bone marrow transplantation. Among the 41 cases reviewed, 7 patients had coexisting GVHD in other organs (skin or liver). However, gastrointestinal symptoms of at least 4 HSCT patients whose colon biopsies contained 6 or fewer apoptotic bodies completely resolved in the absence of further intervention for GVHD. The discrepancy between pathologic findings and the clinical course may be due to confounding factors, such as infection or medication-induced injury. Our data suggest that identifying 6 or fewer crypt apoptotic bodies in colon biopsies from HSCT patients is worth reporting in order to alert the clinicians of the possibility of GVHD but not sufficient to render a diagnosis on the pathologic grounds alone. The colon biopsies containing 6 or fewer apoptotic bodies represent a heterogenous group. We suggest this group to be classified as indeterminate for GVHD, instead of diagnosing GVHD outright. Synthesis of all clinical, endoscopic, and pathologic information, including the status of infection, coexisting GVHD involvement in the other organs, and medication, is essential for confirmation of the diagnosis of GVHD.",,"['Lin, Jingmei', 'Fan, Rong', 'Zhao, Zijin', 'Cummings, Oscar W', 'Chen, Shaoxiong']","['Lin J', 'Fan R', 'Zhao Z', 'Cummings OW', 'Chen S']","['Departments of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN 46202, USA. jinglin@iupui.edu']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Am J Surg Pathol,The American journal of surgical pathology,7707904,,IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', '*Apoptosis', 'Biopsy', 'Colitis/diagnosis/surgery/virology', 'Colon/*pathology', 'Cytomegalovirus Infections/diagnosis/surgery', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Fetal Blood/*transplantation', 'Gastrointestinal Diseases/*diagnosis/etiology', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*diagnosis/etiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Intestinal Mucosa/*pathology', 'Leukemia/pathology/surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Young Adult']",,,2012/12/06 06:00,2013/05/08 06:00,['2012/12/06 06:00'],"['2012/12/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/12/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/PAS.0b013e318272c62a [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Surg Pathol. 2013 Apr;37(4):539-47. doi: 10.1097/PAS.0b013e318272c62a.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Overexpression of the IAP BIRC6 is associated with unfavorable clinical features and negatively impacts relapse-free survival in childhood acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Currently, BIRC6 levels in adult primary AML have not been compared to the expression in normal myeloid cells. Thus, we compared for the first time BIRC6 levels in adult primary AML patient samples to normal myeloid cells and studied its regulation and function during neutrophil differentiation. FINDINGS: We found significantly lower BIRC6 levels in particular AML subtypes as compared to granulocytes from healthy donors. The lowest BIRC6 expression was found in CD34+ progenitor cells.

Therapeutic management of CML uses tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), which block ABL-signaling and effectively kill peripheral cells with BCR-ABL. However, TKIs are not curative, and chronic use is required in order to treat CML. The primary failure for TKIs is through the development of a resistant population due to mutations in the TKI binding regions. This led us to develop the mutant coiled-coil, CC(mut2), an alternative method for BCR-ABL signaling inhibition by targeting the N-terminal oligomerization domain of BCR, necessary for ABL activation. In this article, we explore additional pathways that are important for leukemic stem cell survival in K562 cells. Using a candidate-based approach, we test the combination of CC(mut2) and inhibitors of unique secondary pathways in leukemic cells. Transformative potential was reduced following silencing of the leukemic stem cell factor Alox5 by RNA interference. Furthermore, blockade of the oncogenic protein MUC-1 by the novel peptide GO-201 yielded reductions in proliferation and increased cell death. Finally, we found that inhibiting macroautophagy using chloroquine in addition to blocking BCR-ABL signaling with the CC(mut2) was most effective in limiting cell survival and proliferation.

The MLL1/WDR5 protein-protein interaction is essential for MLL1 enzymatic activity. In the present study, we designed a large number of peptidomimetics to target the MLL1/WDR5 interaction based upon -CO-ARA-NH-, the minimum binding motif derived from MLL1. Our study led to the design of high-affinity peptidomimetics, which bind to WDR5 with K(i) < 1 nM and function as potent antagonists of MLL1 activity in a fully reconstituted in vitro H3K4 methyltransferase assay. Determination of co-crystal structures of two potent peptidomimetics in complex with WDR5 establishes their structural basis for high-affinity binding to WDR5. Evaluation of one such peptidomimetic, MM-102, in bone marrow cells transduced with MLL1-AF9 fusion construct shows that the compound effectively decreases the expression of HoxA9 and Meis-1, two critical MLL1 target genes in MLL1 fusion protein mediated leukemogenesis. MM-102 also specifically inhibits cell growth and induces apoptosis in leukemia cells harboring MLL1 fusion proteins.
