To reduce the risk of post-autografting disease recurrence, different strategies of stem cell selection have been attempted. The results of using recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rHuG-CSF) for harvesting hematopoietic progenitors in CML patients treated with interferon-a (IFN) are reported. DESIGN AND METHODS: Twenty-one CML patients who received IFN for a median of 21 (8-68) months were mobilized with rHuG-CSF (10 mg/kg/day). Twelve were in complete (CCR) or major (MCR) cytogenetic response. Complete success was considered a sufficient harvest (> 1 x 10(6)/kg CD34(+) cells/kg) without Philadelphia (Ph)+ metaphases in at least one apheresis; a partial success was a sufficient harvest with 1-35% Ph(+) cells. RESULTS: A total of 78 aphereses were performed. No patient had major side-effects. The median number (range) of mononuclear and CD34(+) cells obtained was, respectively, 8.6 x 10(8)/kg (0.9-22.6) and 3.3 x 10(6)/kg (0.4-26.3) per patient. A sufficient cell yield was collected in all but three patients. A complete/partial success was achieved in seven CCR/MCR patients (63%) and in three (33%) with other responses. Four patients underwent successful autografting using the stem cells obtained after rHuG-CSF mobilization. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Mobilization of IFN-treated patients using rHuG-CSF is safe and provides a significant proportion of Ph-negative progenitors in CML patients in complete or major cytogenetic response.","['Hernandez-Boluda, Juan-Carlos', 'Carreras, Enric', 'Cervantes, Francisco', 'Marin, Pedro', 'Arellano-Rodrigo, Eduardo', 'Rovira, Montserrat', 'Sole, Francesc', 'Lloveras, Elisabet', 'Espinet, Blanca', 'Ocejo, Agustin', 'Montserrat, Emili']","['Hernandez-Boluda JC', 'Carreras E', 'Cervantes F', 'Marin P', 'Arellano-Rodrigo E', 'Rovira M', 'Sole F', 'Lloveras E', 'Espinet B', 'Ocejo A', 'Montserrat E']","['BMT Unit, Institute of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Hematology, Hospital del Mar, Villaroel 170, 08036 Barcelona, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Immunologic Factors)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '9008-11-1 (Interferons)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)', 'PVI5M0M1GW (Filgrastim)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",IM,['Haematologica. 2002 Jan;87(1):3-6.

A multicenter study.,9-16,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) comprise a group of heterogeneous hematologic disorders with risk of leukemic evolution (LE). The French-American-British (FAB) co-operative group classifies them into five morphologic entities and the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) proposes four groups of risk on the basis of clinical and cytogenetic variables. The aim of this study was to evaluate the application of the IPSS in our Argentine population, to test the prognostic value of its variables and to determine whether this score helps to associate prognostic subgroups of risk into FAB subtypes. DESIGN AND METHODS: Two hundred and thirty-four patients with primary MDS and a median follow-up of 28 months were evaluated using univariate analyses to determine median survival (SV) and the time to LE. The variables analyzed were FAB classification, IPSS, percentage of myeloblasts, cytogenetic groups of risk and number of cytopenias. RESULTS: Univariate analyses showed that all variables analyzed were predictive for SV and for LE in our MDS population. Application of the IPSS allowed discrimination into the 4 groups of risk and helped to identify prognostic subclasses among the FAB classification, associating 5%, 15% and 19% of cases with worse prognosis within the FAB classification of refractory anemia (RA), RA with ringed sideroblasts and RA with excess of blasts (RAEB), respectively. The IPSS was not informative for RAEB in transformation cases and would not be applied to patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: This score could be applied to our MDS population, showing no geographic differences. Stratification of FAB patients according to IPSS would be helpful to develop risk-adapted therapeutic strategies.","['Belli, Carolina', 'Acevedo, Susana', 'Bengio, Raquel', 'Arrossagaray, Guillermo', 'Watman, Nora', 'Rossi, Norma', 'Garcia, Juan', 'Flores, Gabriela', 'Goldztein, Sofia', 'Larripa, Irene']","['Belli C', 'Acevedo S', 'Bengio R', 'Arrossagaray G', 'Watman N', 'Rossi N', 'Garcia J', 'Flores G', 'Goldztein S', 'Larripa I']","['Instituto de Investigaciones Hematologicas Martino R.

Fluorescence in situ hybridization identified an amplified 7q21 region translocated on the short arm of a chromosome 2. This region contained the MDR1 gene locus and probably neighboring genes, such as SRI or MDR3/ABCB4.

The second subclone showed the classic t(9;22) plus an add(9)(p24) containing two copies of the ABL1 gene.

Hundreds of glyceryl triesters are used in a wide variety of cosmetic products at concentrations ranging from a few tenths of a percent to 46%. Glyceryl triesters are also known as triglycerides; ingested triglycerides are metabolized to monoglycerides, free fatty acids, and glycerol, all of which are absorbed in the intestinal mucosa and undergo further metabolism. Dermal absorption of Triolein in mice was nil; the oil remained at the application site. Only slight absorption was seen in guinea pig skin. Tricaprylin and other glyceryl triesters have been shown to increase the skin penetration of drugs. Little or no acute, subchronic, or chronic oral toxicity was seen in animal studies unless levels approached a significant percentage of caloric intake. Subcutaneous injections of Tricaprylin in rats over a period of 5 weeks caused a granulomatous reaction characterized by oil deposits surrounded by macrophages. Dermal application was not associated with significant irritation in rabbit skin. Ocular exposures were, at most, mildly irritating to rabbit eyes. No evidence of sensitization or photosensitization was seen in a guinea pig maximization test. Most of the genotoxicity test systems were negative. Tricaprylin, Trioctanoin, and Triolein have historically been used as vehicles in carcinogenicity testing of other chemicals. In one study, subcutaneous injection of Tricaprylin in newborn mice produced more tumors in lymphoid tissue than were seen in untreated animals, whereas neither subcutaneous or intraperitoneal injection in 4- to 6-week-old female mice produced any tumors in another study. Trioctanoin injected subcutaneously in hamsters produced no tumors. Trioctanoin injected intraperitoneally in pregnant rats was associated with an increase in mammary tumors in the offspring compared to that seen in offspring of untreated animals, but similar studies in pregnant hamsters and rabbits showed no tumors in the offspring. One study of Triolein injected subcutaneously in rats showed no tumors at the injection site. As part of an effort to evaluate vehicles used in carcinogenicity studies, the National Toxicology Program conducted a 2-year carcinogenicity study in rats given Tricaprylin by gavage. This treatment was associated with a statistically significant dose-related increase in pancreatic acinar cell hyperplasia and adenoma, but there were no acinar carcinomas, the incidence of mononuclear leukemia was less, and nephropathy findings were reduced, all compared to corn oil controls. Overall, the study concluded that Tricaprylin did not offer significant advantages over corn oil as vehicles in carcinogenicity studies. Trilaurin was found to inhibit the formation of neoplasms initiated by dimethylbenzanthracene (DMBA) and promoted by croton oil. Tricaprylin was not teratogenic in mice or rats, but some reproductive effects were seen in rabbits. A low level of fetal eye abnormalities and a small percentage of abnormal sperm were reported in mice injected with Trioctanoin as a vehicle control. Clinical tests of Trilaurin at 36.3% in a commercial product applied to the skin produced no irritation reactions. Trilaurin, Tristearin, and Tribehenin at 40%, 1.68%, and 0.38%, respectively, in commercial products were also negative in repeated-insult patch tests. Tristearin at 0.32% in a commercial product induced transient, mild to moderate, ocular irritation after instillation into the eyes of human subjects. Based on the enhancement of penetration of other chemicals by skin treatment with glyceryl triesters, it is recommended that care be exercised in using them in cosmetic products. On the basis of the available data, the following 23 glyceryl triesters are considered safe as used in cosmetics: Trilaurin, Triarachidin, Tribehenin, Tricaprin, Tricaprylin, Trierucin, Triheptanoin, Triheptylundecanoin, Triisononanoin, Triisopalmitin, Triisostearin, Trilinolein, Trimyristin, Trioctanoin, Triolein, Tripalmitin, Tripalmitolein, Triricinolein, Tristearin, Triundecanoin, Glyceryl Triacetyl Hydroxystearate, Glyceryl Triacetyl Ricinoleate, and Glyceryl Stearate Diacetate. Some of these are not currently in use, but would be considered safe if used at concentrations similar to those glyceryl triesters that are in use as cosmetic ingredients.","['Johnson, W Jr']",['Johnson W Jr'],"['Cosmetic Ingredient Review, Washington, DC 20036, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Int J Toxicol,International journal of toxicology,9708436,"['0 (Cosmetics)', '0 (Fatty Acids)', '0 (Triglycerides)']",IM,,"['Animals', '*Consumer Product Safety', 'Cosmetics/chemistry/*toxicity', 'Drug Administration Routes', 'Fatty Acids/chemistry/*toxicity', 'Humans', '*Toxicity Tests', 'Triglycerides/chemistry/*toxicity']",2002/01/22 10:00,2002/04/19 10:01,['2002/01/22 10:00'],"['2002/01/22 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/04/19 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/22 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Toxicol. 2001;20 Suppl 4:61-94.,,,['Cosmetic Ingredient Review Expert Panel'],135,,,,,,,,,,

The growth factor leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) has neuroprotectant activity in preclinical models of nerve injury and degeneration and is now in a phase II trial in chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN). It is therefore important to ensure that LIF neither inhibits the antitumour activity of these drugs, nor stimulates tumour growth. METHODS: Mature female Dark Agouti rats were implanted subcutaneously with a mammary carcinoma, DAMA. It was confirmed that the tumour expressed LIF receptors by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Paclitaxel was administered at a dose of 5 mg/kg daily for 6 days, cisplatin at a dose of 3 mg/kg twice weekly and carboplatin at a dose of 10 mg/kg twice weekly. The effect of LIF on tumour growth and response to chemotherapy was assessed at two doses (2 and 10 microg/kg per day). Peripheral neuropathy was assessed in terms of gait disturbance and tail-flick threshold. RESULTS: Neither dose of LIF stimulated growth of control tumours. Mean tumour volumes were lower on day 14 in all paclitaxel-, cisplatin- and carboplatin-treated groups, compared to controls (ANOVA P<0.001). LIF did not interfere with this antitumour effect. Cisplatin- and paclitaxel-treated groups had developed increasing tail-flick thresholds by day 14. These manifestations of sensory neuropathy were prevented by LIF administration. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that LIF may be safely used in human trials as a neuroprotectant for patients receiving cisplatin, paclitaxel and carboplatin without concern for impairment of antitumour effect.","['Boyle, F M', 'Beatson, C', 'Monk, R', 'Grant, S L', 'Kurek, J B']","['Boyle FM', 'Beatson C', 'Monk R', 'Grant SL', 'Kurek JB']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Royal North Shore Hospital, St Leonards, NSW, Australia. franb@med.usyd.edu.au']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', 'BG3F62OND5 (Carboplatin)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Carboplatin/*pharmacology', 'Cisplatin/*pharmacology', 'Drug Interactions', 'Female', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Infusions, Parenteral', 'Injections, Subcutaneous', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*pharmacology', 'Mammary Neoplasms, Experimental', 'Paclitaxel/*pharmacology', 'Peripheral Nervous System Diseases/chemically induced/prevention & control', 'Rats']",2002/01/22 10:00,2002/01/31 10:01,['2002/01/22 10:00'],"['2002/01/22 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/31 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/22 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2001 Dec;48(6):429-34. doi: 10.1007/s00280-001-0382-6.,,['10.1007/s00280-001-0382-6 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we review the historical background, development, and preliminary clinical results of allogeneic stem cell transplantation as immunotherapy for solid tumors.","['Childs, Richard', 'Barrett, John']","['Childs R', 'Barrett J']","['Stem Cell Transplant Unit, Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung and Blood Insitute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Semin Hematol,Seminars in hematology,0404514,,IM,,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/standards/toxicity', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Graft vs Tumor Effect', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*therapy', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods/standards', 'Transplantation, Homologous/immunology']",2002/01/19 10:00,2002/07/12 10:01,['2002/01/19 10:00'],"['2002/01/19 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/07/12 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/19 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Semin Hematol. 2002 Jan;39(1):63-71. doi: 10.1053/shem.2002.29257.,,"['S0037196302500081 [pii]', '10.1053/shem.2002.29257 [doi]']",,58,,,,,,,,,,

This procedure was initially considered as a means to deliver supralethal doses of chemotherapy and radiation for the eradication of the malignancy, but it has subsequently become apparent that much of the therapeutic benefit of SCT relates to an associated immune-mediated graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect. Additionally, due to the increased risk of morbidity and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) that occurs with advanced age, the use of standard myeloablative preparative regimens with allogeneic progenitor cell transplantation has been generally limited to younger patients in good medical condition. However, most patients with hematologic malignancies are older and therefore the overall impact of allografting is relatively small. Thus despite resulting in high rates of long term disease control, allografting is only performed in a small fraction of patients, either because of lack of a suitable donor or the high risk of toxicity due to age or the general medical condition. Therefore strategies aimed at improving the safety and tolerability of allografting to allow for its more frequent application in older patients are necessary.","['Giralt, Sergio', 'Anagnostopoulos, Athanasios', 'Shahjahan, Munir', 'Champlin, Richard']","['Giralt S', 'Anagnostopoulos A', 'Shahjahan M', 'Champlin R']","['Department of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Semin Hematol,Seminars in hematology,0404514,,IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/standards/toxicity', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/*methods/mortality', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/mortality/*therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/mortality/*therapy', 'Transplantation Conditioning/adverse effects/*methods/mortality', 'Treatment Outcome']",2002/01/19 10:00,2002/07/12 10:01,['2002/01/19 10:00'],"['2002/01/19 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/07/12 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/19 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Semin Hematol. 2002 Jan;39(1):57-62. doi: 10.1053/shem.2002.30909.,,"['S003719630250007X [pii]', '10.1053/shem.2002.30909 [doi]']",,59,,['Copyright 2002 by W.B.

Early results in leukemia patients were disappointing because of a high incidence of severe graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) in T-replete transplants or high rejection rates in T-cell-depleted transplants. The breakthrough came with introduction of a megadose T-cell-depleted progenitor cell transplant following a high-intensity conditioning regimen and the realization that donor natural killer (NK) cell alloreactivity also plays a role in facilitating engraftment and in preventing relapse. Treating end-stage patients inevitably confounded clinical outcome in early pilot studies. Today, high-risk acute leukemia patients are treated at less advanced stages of disease, receive a reasonably well-tolerated conditioning regimen, and benefit from advances in post-transplant immunological reconstitution. These factors have markedly reduced transplant-related mortality. Overall, event-free survival (EFS) and transplant-related mortality (TRM) compare favorably with reports from unrelated matched transplants.

Substantial protease activity, found in certain mold extracts, has been suspected to cause a loss of allergenic activity as a result of self-degradation, as well as by means of degradation of allergens from pollen and other allergenic sources. OBJECTIVE: This study was performed to address possible deterioration of individual pollen allergens during storage of extract mixtures, with a mold extract as the source of proteolytic activity. METHODS: Aqueous birch and timothy pollen extracts were stored for 60 days at 6 degrees C with and without addition of an extract derived from the mold Fusarium culmorum. The stability of the pollen allergens Bet v 1, Bet v 6, Phl p 1, and Phl p 5, as well as 2 to-date-undefined F culmorum allergens was examined by using immunoblotting analysis with sera from allergic patients and allergen-specific mAbs. Furthermore, the residual allergenic activity of the pollen extracts was monitored by using the rat basophilic leukemia cell-mediator release assay. Proteolytic activity of extracts was determined by using a commercial protease assay and gelatinase zymography. RESULTS: Pollen extracts were very stable, corresponding to the low proteolytic activity of these extracts. In contrast, high proteolytic activity was found for the F culmorum extract, resulting in self-degradation of mold proteins and deactivation of allergens. Similarly, the mixtures showed a strong decrease of allergenic potency in the mediator release assay. Bet v 1 and Phl p 1 were relatively stable, whereas Bet v 6 and Phl p 5 were almost entirely degraded within 1 day. CONCLUSIONS: Proteases of the mold F culmorum clearly affected the overall allergenic activity of pollen extracts within a short time period. Apart from general objections against the use of mixtures of non-cross-reacting allergens, mixing of pollen extracts with extracts derived from molds for immunotherapy is not recommended unless they are applied directly after preparation of the mixture.","['Hoff, Michael', 'Krail, Marion', 'Kastner, Marion', 'Haustein, Dieter', 'Vieths, Stefan']","['Hoff M', 'Krail M', 'Kastner M', 'Haustein D', 'Vieths S']","['Paul-Ehrlich-Institut, Department of Allergology, Langen.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Allergy Clin Immunol,The Journal of allergy and clinical immunology,1275002,"['0 (Allergens)', '0 (Fungal Proteins)', 'EC 3.4.- (Endopeptidases)']",IM,,"['Allergens/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Endopeptidases/*pharmacology', 'Fungal Proteins/*pharmacology', 'Fusarium/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Pollen/*immunology', 'Rats']",2002/01/19 10:00,2002/02/16 10:01,['2002/01/19 10:00'],"['2002/01/19 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/16 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/19 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Allergy Clin Immunol. 2002 Jan;109(1):96-101. doi: 10.1067/mai.2002.120560.,,"['S0091674902580829 [pii]', '10.1067/mai.2002.120560 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

When using recombinant retroviruses as vectors for gene transfer and gene therapy, it is important to consider the implications of this biological characteristic. Until now, the mutation rate has been studied by using noneukaryotic genes as reporters. Here we report point mutations in the human glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (hG6PD) gene transferred by Moloney murine leukemia virus-based vectors into murine bone marrow cells and NIH 3T3 murine fibroblasts. After bone marrow transplantation, we observed an hG6PD with abnormal electrophoretic mobility for 2 out of 34 mice. Next, we studied this phenomenon quantitatively and found 1 electrophoretically abnormal hG6PD variant among 93 independently isolated NIH 3T3 clones, from which we estimate a mutation rate of 1.4 x 10(-5) per base pair per replication cycle. Mutations in the transferred gene can thus contribute to the impairment of the effectiveness of retrovirus-mediated gene transfer.","['De Angioletti, Maria', 'Rovira, Ana', 'Sadelain, Michel', 'Luzzatto, Lucio', 'Notaro, Rosario']","['De Angioletti M', 'Rovira A', 'Sadelain M', 'Luzzatto L', 'Notaro R']","['Department of Human Genetics, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,['EC 1.1.1.49 (Glucosephosphate Dehydrogenase)'],IM,,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells', '*Eukaryotic Cells', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Glucosephosphate Dehydrogenase/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Experimental/virology', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', '*Mutation, Missense', 'Retroviridae Infections/virology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/virology']",2002/01/19 10:00,2002/02/23 10:01,['2002/01/19 10:00'],"['2002/01/19 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/23 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/19 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2002 Feb;76(4):1991-4. doi: 10.1128/jvi.76.4.1991-1994.2002.,,['10.1128/jvi.76.4.1991-1994.2002 [doi]'],,,,,,"['P01 HL059312/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL057612/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL57612/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL59312/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC135901,,,,,

A novel, divergent type of STLV (STLV-L) from captive baboons was reported in 1994, but its natural prevalence remained unclear. We investigated the prevalence of STLV-L in 519 blood samples from wild-living nonhuman primates in Ethiopia. Seropositive monkeys having cross-reactive antibodies against HTLV were found among 22 out of 40 hamadryas baboons, 8 of 96 anubis baboons, 24 of 50 baboons that are hybrids between hamadryas and anubis baboons, and 41 of 177 grivet monkeys, but not in 156 gelada baboons. A Western blotting assay showed that sera obtained from seropositive hamadryas and hybrid baboons exhibited STLV-L-like reactivity. A PCR assay successfully amplified STLV sequences, which were subsequently sequenced and confirmed as being closely related to STLV-L. Surprisingly, further PCR showed that nearly half of the hamadryas (20 out of 40) and hybrid (19 out of 50) baboons had STLV-L DNA sequences. In contrast, most of the seropositive anubis baboons and grivet monkeys carried typical STLV-1 but not STLV-L. These observations demonstrate that STLV-L naturally prevails among hamadryas and hybrid baboons at significantly high rates. STLV-1 and -2, the close relative of STLV-L, are believed to have jumped across simian-human barriers, which resulted in widespread infection of HTLV-1 and -2.

Carnitine acyltransferases are key enzymes of this process in mitochondria. As previously shown, the rate of transcription and activity of carnitine palmitoyltransferase CPT1 are also related to carnitine levels.

The transcription rate of CPT1, CPT2, and carnitine acetyltransferase (CRAT) was determined by quantitative reverse transcription real-time PCR (RTQPCR) and compared to the activity of the CPT1A enzyme. The results showed that the transcription rates of CPT1, CPT2, and CRAT were similar in aged and adult control animals. Carnitine-fed old rats had a significant (p<0.05) 8-12-fold higher mean transcription rate of CPT1 and CRAT compared to aged controls, adult carnitine-fed animals, and adult controls, whereas the transcription rate of CPT2 was stimulated 2-3-fold in carnitine-fed animals of both age groups. With regard to the enzymatic activity of CPT1 there was a 1.5-fold increase in the old carnitine group compared to all other groups. RNA in situ hybridization also indicated an enhanced expression of CPT1A in hepatocytes from l-carnitine-supplemented animals.

Using a yeast two-hybrid assay to identify potential coregulators of Pax5, we identified Daxx, a protein that is highly conserved, ubiquitously expressed, and essential for embryonic mouse development. The interaction between Pax5 and Daxx involves the partial homeodomain of Pax5 and the C-terminal fragment of Daxx. A component of promyelocytic leukemia protein nuclear bodies, Daxx has been implicated in apoptosis and characterized as a transcriptional corepressor. Upon transient transfection assay of Daxx in B cells expressing endogenous Daxx and Pax5, we observed not only transcriptional corepression but also, unexpectedly, coactivation in M12.4.1 and A20 mouse B cell lines. Pax5 domains required for coactivation were identified using 293T cells. Coactivation apparently involves recruitment of the CREB binding protein (CBP), because we precipitated complexes containing Pax5, Daxx, and CBP in B cell lines.

RESULTS: J6-1 cells constitutively expresses IL-18 mRNA, and its cDNA sequence shared 99% homology with the published IL-18 sequence,except that a synonymous point mutation (Codon35 UCA to UCC) was confirmed by sequencing and alignment analysis. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of healthy volunteers weakly expresses IL-18 mRNA (0.13 +/- 0.05), while CpG-ODN significantly up-modulated IL-18 expression in PBMC (0.82 +/- 0.24), but not in J6-1 cells. Compared with K562, HL-60, U937 and LCL cells, IL-18 mRNA level expression of in J6-1 cells was the highest (0.98 +/- 0.29). ASODN of IL-18 markedly inhibited the proliferation of J6-1 cells (inhibition rate 43.3%), but did not show significant effects on HL-60 cells (inhibition rate 16.7%). CONCLUSIONS: J6-1 cells constitutively expresses IL-18 mRNA, and no significant mutation was detected coding region of IL-18 cDNA. IL-18 might be a positive regulation factor for the proliferation of J6-1 cells after in an autocrine model.","['Wang, Y', 'Li, G', 'Rao, Q']","['Wang Y', 'Li G', 'Rao Q']","['Institute of Hematology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College.

METHODS: Eleven patients, 2 with acute lymphatic leukemia, 2 with acute myelocytic leukemia, and 7 with chronic myelocytic leukemia, were treated by URD-BMT. The median age of the 11 patients, 6 male and 5 females, were 26 years. The conditioning regimen for 10 patients was: BU 4 mg.kg(-1).d(-1) x 4 + CTX 60 mg.kg(-1).d(-1)1 x or TBI 7.5 Gy + CTX 60 mg.kg(-1).d(-1) x 2. Bone marrow with karyocytes in the dose of (2.6 approximately 4.8) x 10(8)/kg, including CD34+ cells in the dose of (3.82 approximately 12.8) x 10(6)/kg, and with the CFU-CM in the dose of (1.71 approximately 3.68) x 10(5)/kg, were transfused. Mycophenolate mofitil, cyclosporine, and methotrexate were given to prevent acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD). Continuous intravenous drip of heparin in low dose with Lipo protaglandin E1 was given to prevent hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD). Ganciclovir was used to prevent CMV infection. HLA phenotype was matched in 8 cases, mismatched in one locus in 2 cases, and mismatched in 2 loci in one case. RESULTS: Hematopoietic reconstruction was successful in all of the patients with the neutrophil count of 0.5 x 10(9)/L on the 10th day after transplantation and the platelet count of more than 20 x 10(9)/L on the 27(th) day. Analysis of DNA short series repeated sequence polymorphism showed the survival of bone marrow after transplantation in ten cases. One case of IV grade aGVHD, one case of II grade aGVHD, one case of serious VOD and III grade artrioventricular block, three cases of hemorrhagic cystitis, and one case of interstitial pneumonia occurred, the last case being died. Recurrence of leukemia occurred in one case seven months after the transplantation. That case was given the transfusion of donor's lymphocytes and has been so far under treated. Ten cases are alive in disease-free situation till now. CONCLUSION: URD-BMT is an effective method for the treatment of acute and chronic leukemia. The prophylaxis regimen against aGVHD, VOD, and CMV that we use is effective and safe.","['Huang, H', 'Lin, M', 'Meng, H']","['Huang H', 'Lin M', 'Meng H']","['Department of Hematological, First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310003, China.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",China,Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua yi xue za zhi,7511141,,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Child', 'Cystitis/etiology', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', 'Hemorrhage/etiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/therapy', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', 'Platelet Count', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/therapy', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2002/01/19 10:00,2002/04/20 10:01,['2002/01/19 10:00'],"['2002/01/19 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/04/20 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/19 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi. 2001 Mar 10;81(5):263-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To further investigate the molecular basis of combination therapy on CML by chemotherapeutants combined with cytokines. METHODS: The proliferation and viability of K562 cells were detected by cell-counting and trypan blue dye exclusion test. The levels of bcr-abl, bax and c-myc gene expression in K562 cells incubated for 48 hours were examined using RT-PCR technique. RESULTS: proliferation was suppressed and cell death process was accelerated by both HU and HU combined with IFN-alpha. HU significantly inhibited bcr-abl gene expression and increased bax gene expression level (both P < 0.05 as compared with that of control). Furthermore, IFN-alpha dose-dependently enhanced the regulatory effects of HU on bcr-abl and bax gene expression. HU alone and in combination with IFN-alpha suppressed slightly c-myc gene expression. CONCLUSIONS: Both HU and HU combined with IFN-alpha can inhibit cell proliferation and promote cell death or apoptotic cell death by regulating the expression levels of the genes relating to cell proliferation and apoptosis. The molecular mechanism of HU and IFN-alpha synergistically acting on leukemic cells is further elucidated from the expression level of the related genes which control the balance of survival and death or apoptosis of the cells.","['Chen, H', 'Luo, Z', 'Luo, S']","['Chen H', 'Luo Z', 'Luo S']","['Research Center for Molecular Biology, Hunan Medical University, Changsha 410078, China.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",China,Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua yi xue za zhi,7511141,"['0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",IM,,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Synergism', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/*pharmacology', 'Interferon-alpha/*pharmacology', 'K562 Cells', 'Oncogenes/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/drug effects/genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Time Factors', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein']",2002/01/19 10:00,2002/07/12 10:01,['2002/01/19 10:00'],"['2002/01/19 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/07/12 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/19 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi. 2000 Aug;80(8):606-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The PCA of APL blasts freshly isolated from the APL patients treated with ATRA or As(2)O(3) was detected using a one-stage clotting assay; the TF antigen was detected by ELISA and TF mRNA by RT-PCR. The maturation sensitivity (NB4) or resistant subclones (NB4-R1) of the promyelocytic NB4 cell line as well as U937 cells transfected with pMSCV-PML-RARa treated with or without ATRA or As(2)O(3) were also examined. RESULTS: Both ATRA and As(2)O(3) time-dependently down-regulated the TF antigen, its mRNA transcription and membrane PCA of APL cells in vivo and in vitro. The TF antigen level in PML-RARa(+) U937 cells was significantly higher than that in U937 cells transfected with retrovirus vector (890 pg/8 x 10(5) +/- 80 pg/8 x 10(5) cell and 728 pg/8 x 10(5) +/- 86 pg/8 x 10(5) cell, respectively).

The 5-year long-term survival rate was 18.6% for all the cases, being 13.3% for acute myeloid leukemia and 28.1% for acute lymphocytic leukemia. Children, lower white blood cell count, higher blood platelet count, lower percentage of blast cell in peripheral blood and no DIC and FAB-M(3) were protective factors for long-term survival. The remission induction regimens such as DA (daunorubicin and cytarabine) and HA (homoharringtonine and cytarabine) had no relation to long-term survival. There was no difference between the median survival time of the group with chemotherapy time less than 3 years and the group more than 3 years for acute myeloid leukemia. However, the median survival time was shorter in the group with chemotherapy time less than 3 years for acute lymphocytic leukemia. CONCLUSIONS: The 5-year survival rate for acute leukemia was 18.6%.

The expression of lrp, mrp and mdr-1 mRNA was detected with RT-PCR assay and that of p170 measured with immunocytochemistry. RESULTS: The frequency of lrp gene expression in ANLL A, B and C group was 11.11%, 9.09% and 36.36%, in ALL A, B, C group it was 0%, 20.00% and 46.67%; the frequency of mrp gene expression in ANLL A, B, C group was 44.44%, 9.09% and 59.09%, in ALL A, B, C group it was 28.57%, 20.00% and 53. 33%; the frequency of mdr-1 gene expression in ANLL A, B, C group was 0%, 4.54% and 59.09%, in ALL A, B, C group it was 0%, 0% and 33.33%; p170 expression in ANLL C group was (9.45 +/- 14.66) %, it was the highest value in the three groups; statistics showed that there was no correlationship among the expressions of lrp, mrp and mdr-1 gene, P > 0.05; patients with lrp and mdr-1 expression had a lower complete remission (CR) percentage than those who had not in the untreated group; the combination of lrp, mrp and mdr-1 gene detection turned out to be a more sensitive, specific and accurate way in evaluation of multidrug resistance (MDR). CONCLUSION: Overexpression of one or more genes of lrp, mrp and mdr-1/p170 is associated with MDR in AL. Expression of lrp, mrp and mdr-1/p170 is good indicators in clinical MDR. Two or three factors of lrp, mrp and mdr-1 are more valuable in the evaluation of MDR than any one of these three factors.

RESULTS: (1) The percentage of hypomyeloplastic MDS was 11.4% of the total 219 MDS patients. The median age of the 25 cases was (44.8 +/- 14.7) years. (2) FAB subtype: There were 11 cases of RA and 14 of RAEB. (3) Hypomyeloplastic MDS seems to be a developmental phase in the clinical course in some of the patients and not a special type of MDS.

RESULTS: The plasma levels of TF [(98.3 +/- 19.8) ng/L, (89.6 +/- 15.2) ng/L], TFPI [(94.4 +/- 37.0) mg/L, (93.5 +/- 36.4) mg/L], TAT [(21.9 +/- 9.6) microg/L, (18.2 +/- 9.7) microg/L[, PAP [(0.73 +/- 0.26) mg/L, (0.63 +/- 0.33) mg/L], u-PA [(0.63 +/- 0.23) microg/L, (0.57 +/- 0.01) microg/L] and u-PAR [(0.41 +/- 0.14) microg/L, (0.47 +/- 0.16) microg/L], the TF of bone marrow blasts lysate [(680.24 +/- 456.61) pg/10(7), (368.02 +/- 151.2) pg/10(7)] and transcription of mRNA were all remarkably elevated at the time of diagnosis. They all decreased after ATRA and AS(2)O(3) administration. CONCLUSIONS: There is over expression of TF, activation of coagulation system and hyperfibrinolysis, in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia, these can be ameliorated with clinical improvement. All-trans retinoic acid and arsenic trioxide down-regulate the expression of TF mRNA and decrease the TF contents in APL blasts. However, there is also high plasma level of TF and TAT indicating the existence of hypercoagulability after remission.","['Wu, F', 'Wang, X', 'Zhao, W', 'Wang, H', 'Shen, Z']","['Wu F', 'Wang X', 'Zhao W', 'Wang H', 'Shen Z']","['Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Second Medical University, Shanghai 200025, China.']",['chi'],['Journal Article'],China,Zhonghua Nei Ke Za Zhi,Zhonghua nei ke za zhi,16210490R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '9035-58-9 (Thromboplastin)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*therapeutic use', 'Female', '*Hemostasis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy/*physiopathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oxides/*therapeutic use', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Thromboplastin/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tretinoin/*therapeutic use']",2002/01/19 10:00,2006/02/18 09:00,['2002/01/19 10:00'],"['2002/01/19 10:00 [pubmed]', '2006/02/18 09:00 [medline]', '2002/01/19 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Zhonghua Nei Ke Za Zhi. 2001 Jan;40(1):36-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Semi-quantitative RT-PCR, sequencing and ELISA were used to detect the constructive expression of IL-6 mRNA and autosecretion level of IL-6 protein in human leukemic cell lines, such as U937, HL60, KG1, TF1, K562, HuT28, CEM and Raji. RESULTS: The relative expression level of IL-6 mRNA in myelocytic, monocytic and erythrocytic leukemic cell lines including HL60, U937, KG1 and TF1 and lymphoblastic leukemic cell lines such as CEM, HuT28 and Raji is very weak, ranging from 0.03 to 0.07. However, K562, an chronic myelocytic leukemic cell line, had the highest level 1.25 among the 8 leukemic cell lines and the level was also higher than that of the positive control U266 multiple myeloma cell line. Based on ELISA assay of IL-6, there were remarkable differences between the 8 leukemic cell lines, their secretion of IL-6 could be divided into 3 levels, i.e. high, moderate and low secretion type. CONCLUSION: These observations imply that the intrinsic expression and secretion of IL-6 differ obviously among different leukemic cell lines.

To track the intracellular pathway of CD34 after binding of a stimulatory antibody (anti-HPCA-1), immuno-electron microscopical analysis was performed on cells of normal bone marrow (NBMPC), acute leukemias, and the KG1a cell line. Before stimulation, CD34 was evenly distributed over the cell surface. After binding of the anti-HPCA-1, but not the anti-HPCA-2 antibody to CD34 and labeling with 30-nm immunogold, a rapid capping of CD34 and a subsequent internalization from the cell surface via clathrin-coated pits and coated vesicles was observed. The percentage of internalized CD34/immunogold complexes ranged from 8 to 80% in the NBMPC and the leukemic blasts, whereas KG1a cells showed an internalization rate of only 0.42%. Moreover, in the KG1a cells, the CD34/immunogold complexes were not associated with the coated pits. These differences in CD34 internalization did not correlate to the mRNA expression for the full-length or truncated CD34 assessed by isotype-specific real-time PCR. Taken together, evidence was found that CD34 is a surface receptor molecule that is modulated by receptor-mediated endocytosis. CD34 on KG1a cells appears to have a functional and/or structural defect, preventing modulation of this epitope.","['Krauter, J', 'Hartl, M', 'Hambach, L', 'Kohlenberg, A', 'Gunsilius, E', 'Ganser, A', 'Heil, G']","['Krauter J', 'Hartl M', 'Hambach L', 'Kohlenberg A', 'Gunsilius E', 'Ganser A', 'Heil G']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.

However, until now no information is available about changes of this peculiar precursor cell population during therapy or possible associations with the other bone marrow constituents. For this reason, a retrospective clinicopathological study was performed on 83 patients with CML including 209 sequential bone marrow biopsies (intervals ranging between 6 and 143 months) and immunohistological staining of CD34(+) cells (QBEND10), megakaryocyte precursors (CD61), and erythropoiesis (Ret 40f). According to treatment modalities, three different groups of patients could be distinguished that received either monotherapy by interferon-alpha2b (IFN-alpha2b) or hydroxyurea (HU) and a combination of both. In comparison with a control group, morphometry revealed a significant increase in the quantity of CD34(+) PGCs per hematopoiesis (cellularity) in the CML bone marrow before treatment. Independently of treatment modalities and presentation of clinical findings nonresponding patients were generally characterized by a higher amount of progenitors in the initial biopsy specimens. Furthermore, calculation of the CD34(+) cell growth index showed a significant and rapid progression in nonresponding patients and in those developing an accelerated or blastic phase during therapy. This feature was prominently expressed following IFN treatment and related to a failing regeneration of nucleated erythroid precursors. In patients with a myelofibrotic bone marrow at onset no differences in the number of CD34(+) PGCs were recognizable in the pretreatment biopsies. This finding contrasted a significant and gradual change in progenitor cell frequency under treatment and evolving myelofibrosis. Opposed to HU therapy, the latter feature was explicitly detectable in the IFN group. In conclusion, the incidence of CD34(+) PGCs in the CML bone marrow reflects therapeutic efficacy. By demonstrating a significant relationship between fiber content and quantity of CD34(+) cells during treatment, experimental findings concerning the complex functional interactions between the fibrous stroma compartment and progenitor cell differentiation and proliferation are elucidated.","['Thiele, J', 'Kvasnicka, H M', 'Schmitt-Graeff, A', 'Goekce, D', 'Diehl, V', 'Zankovich, R', 'Schaefer, H E']","['Thiele J', 'Kvasnicka HM', 'Schmitt-Graeff A', 'Goekce D', 'Diehl V', 'Zankovich R', 'Schaefer HE']","['Institute of Pathology, University of Cologne, Germany. j.thiele@uni-koeln.de']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Hematother Stem Cell Res,Journal of hematotherapy & stem cell research,100892915,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Interferon alpha-2)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",IM,,"['Antigens, CD34/*analysis', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Biopsy', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Interferon alpha-2', 'Interferon-alpha/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/pathology', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Therapeutic Equivalency', 'Time Factors']",2002/01/19 10:00,2003/04/12 05:00,['2002/01/19 10:00'],"['2002/01/19 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/12 05:00 [medline]', '2002/01/19 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Hematother Stem Cell Res. 2001 Dec;10(6):827-36. doi: 10.1089/152581601317210926.,,['10.1089/152581601317210926 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

However, in vitro purging generally delays post-transplant hematopoietic recovery, thus increasing treatment-related complication rates. Theoretically, this prolonged aplasia might be shortened by the additional transplantation of ex vivo-generated progenitor cells. Therefore, we investigated whether nonleukemic progenitors could be expanded ex vivo from AML cell-contaminated CD34(+) peripheral blood progenitor cell (PBPC) preparations. Nonleukemic CD34(+)-selected PBPC and AML cells (Kasumi-1, KG-1, primary AML blasts) were cultured in cytokine-supplemented liquid culture for up to 19 days. Cells were used either unmanipulated or following in vitro purging with mafosfamide (30, 50, 75 microg/ml). Ex vivo-generated cells were assessed by flow cytometry, progenitor cell assays, and polymerase chain reaction. Without prior purging, ex vivo culture markedly amplified AML cells as well as nonleukemic CD34(+) PBPC (day 12: Kasumi-1, 18.5 +/- 0.6-fold; KG-1, 52.2 +/- 2.6-fold; CD34(+), 74.1 +/- 5.6-fold). Co-culture with leukemic cells did not affect CD34(+) cell growth and vice versa. Following in vitro purging, CD34(+) PBPC were expanded even at the highest mafosfamide dose (day 19: 25 +/- 15-fold), whereas leukemic cells were markedly depleted (approx. 1.5 log). Furthermore, normal colony-forming units (CFU) could be effectively recovered (day 19: 10 +/- 3.1% of prepurging input CFU), whereas CFU-L were depleted to undetectable levels in six of seven experiments. Finally, leukemic cells were undetectable following ex vivo co-culture of purged cells (CD34(+) PBPC plus 10% Kasumi-1 cells or primary blasts), but were clearly detectable without purging. Taken together, these data demonstrated that ex vivo expansion of normal progenitors from mafosfamide-purged AML cell-contaminated grafts might be feasible.","['Stilz, R', 'Grunebach, F', 'Bader, P', 'Vogel, W', 'Kanz, L', 'Brugger, W', 'Scheding, S']","['Stilz R', 'Grunebach F', 'Bader P', 'Vogel W', 'Kanz L', 'Brugger W', 'Scheding S']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology, Oncology, Immunology and Rheumatology, University of Tubingen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Hematother Stem Cell Res,Journal of hematotherapy & stem cell research,100892915,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '5970HH9923 (mafosfamide)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)']",IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Antigens, CD34', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Blood Cells/cytology/immunology', 'Bone Marrow Purging/*methods', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Cyclophosphamide/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/cytology/drug effects']",2002/01/19 10:00,2003/04/12 05:00,['2002/01/19 10:00'],"['2002/01/19 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/12 05:00 [medline]', '2002/01/19 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Hematother Stem Cell Res. 2001 Dec;10(6):777-85. doi: 10.1089/152581601317210872.,,['10.1089/152581601317210872 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The present compound, Et2SnCl2.L [L = N-(2-pyridylmethylene)-4-toluidine] (OTC), showed an Sn-N bond length of 2.46 A which, because it is bigger than 2.39 A, is expected to achieve better formation of tin-DNA complexes. We previously reported on the synthesis and biological activity of this compound and on its ability to cause a delay in cell proliferation and sister chromatid exchanges in mouse bone marrow cells. In this study, we carried out further investigations on the antiproliferative and antitumor activity of OTC in relation to the cellular glutathione (GSH) level, which plays an important role in the cellular defense mechanism. OTC induced significant delay in the cell cycle in mouse bone marrow cells and, when the GSH level was low, the extent of the delay was reduced. The antitumor activity was determined in accordance with the US National Cancer Institute (NCI) standard protocol for primary screening in Dalton's lymphoma (DL) that was maintained by serial intraperitoneal transplantation. The T/C (treated/control) value was 146% when organotin was treated after transplantation; this improved significantly when buthionine sulfoximine (BSO), a GSH-depleting agent, was added 24 hours before the tin treatment. Our data suggest that the present tin compound has antiproliferative ability and can increase the survival of mice bearing DL. The endogenous GSH level influences the effect of the tin compound.","['Syng-Ai, C', 'Basu Baul, T S', 'Chatterjee, A']","['Syng-Ai C', 'Basu Baul TS', 'Chatterjee A']","['Department of Zoology, North Eastern Hill University, Shillong, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Environ Pathol Toxicol Oncol,"Journal of environmental pathology, toxicology and oncology : official organ of the International Society for Environmental Toxicology and Cancer",8501420,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA Adducts)', '0 (N-(2-pyridylmethylene)-4-toluidine)', '0 (Organotin Compounds)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (Toluidines)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Division/*drug effects', 'Chemoprevention', 'DNA Adducts', 'Lymphoma/prevention & control', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Organotin Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Pyridines/*pharmacology', 'Sister Chromatid Exchange', 'Survival Analysis', 'Toluidines/*pharmacology']",2002/01/19 10:00,2002/02/01 10:01,['2002/01/19 10:00'],"['2002/01/19 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/01 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/19 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Environ Pathol Toxicol Oncol. 2001;20(4):333-42.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thorotrast was composed of thorium dioxide (ThO2) and Th-232, a naturally occurring radionuclide. Because the physical half-life of ThO2 is 14 billion years and Thorotrast is hardly eliminated from the body, tissues in which it was deposited are irradiated by alpha-radiation for the entire lifetime of the subject. The dosimetry of Thorotrast patients is very complicated, but currently its reliability is quite high compared with other irradiated populations. The major causes of the death of Thorotrast patients are liver cancer, liver cirrhosis, leukemia, and other cancers. Three histologies of liver cancer are found: cholangiocarcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, and angiosarcoma. Although cholangiocarcinoma is the most frequent, angiosarcoma is characteristic of alpha-radiation. Among blood neoplasms with a higher incidence of increase than the general population, erythroleukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome were remarkable. Thorotrast patients exhaled a high concentration of radon (Rn-220), a progeny of Th-232, but no excesses of lung cancer in the patients of Japan, Germany, and Denmark were reported. Mutation analyses of p53 genes and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) studies at 17p locus were performed to characterize the genetic changes in Thorotrast-induced liver tumors. Interestingly, LOH, supposedly corresponding to large deletions was not frequent; most mutations were transitions, also seen in tumors of the general population, suggesting that genetic changes of Thorotrast-induced cancers are mainly delayed mutations, and not the result of the direct effects of radiation.","['Ishikawa, Y', 'Wada, I', 'Fukumoto, M']","['Ishikawa Y', 'Wada I', 'Fukumoto M']","['Department of Pathology, The Cancer Institute, Japanese Foundation for Cancer Research, Tokyo.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Environ Pathol Toxicol Oncol,"Journal of environmental pathology, toxicology and oncology : official organ of the International Society for Environmental Toxicology and Cancer",8501420,"['0 (Carcinogens)', '9XA7X17UQC (Thorium Dioxide)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Alpha Particles/*adverse effects', 'Carcinogens/*adverse effects/pharmacokinetics', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Cause of Death', 'Cholangiocarcinoma/epidemiology/*etiology', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Europe/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Genes, p53', 'Half-Life', 'Hemangiosarcoma/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Humans', 'Japan/epidemiology', 'Leukemia/epidemiology/etiology', 'Liver Cirrhosis/epidemiology/etiology', 'Liver Neoplasms/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Loss of Heterozygosity', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Radiation Injuries', 'Risk Assessment', 'Thorium Dioxide/*adverse effects/pharmacokinetics', 'United States']",2002/01/19 10:00,2002/02/01 10:01,['2002/01/19 10:00'],"['2002/01/19 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/01 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/19 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Environ Pathol Toxicol Oncol. 2001;20(4):311-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epigenetic down-regulation of DAP-Kinase gene expression by hypermethylation of its promoter region was reported in certain kinds of malignancies. Previous patho-epidemiological studies indicated that thyroid lymphoma(TL) evolves among active lymphoid cells in chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis(CLTH). With the use of methylation specific polymerase chain reaction, methylation status of DAP-Kinase CpG island was examined in thyroid lesions of 19 cases with TL and 9 with CLTH. Frequency of methylation was higher in TL cases(16 of 19, 84.2%) than in CLTH cases(2 of 9, 22.2%) (p < 0.01). DNA extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes from TL and CLTH cases never showed methylation, indicating that the methylation occurred somatically in lesional lymphocytes in the thyroid. We also examined the methylation status of DAP-kinase gene in 16 cases of T-cell malignancies including eight adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma and 24 NK/T-cell, 34 B-cell, and two immunophenotypically undetermined lymphomas. Frequency of methylation was higher in B-cell(27 of 34, 79.4%) than in T-cell malignancies(eight of 16, 50%) (p < 0.05). Fifteen of 24(62.5%) NK/T-cell lymphomas showed DNA methylation. Hematopoietic cell lines with a methylated gene were resistant to apoptosis. Treatment of the cells with a demethylating agent restored apoptotic cell death in one B-cell lymphoma cell line with DNA methylation. Our results suggested that suppression of DAP-Kinase expression by DNA methylation might play a role in the development of B-cell malignancies.","['Nakatsuka, S', 'Takakuwa, T', 'Aozasa, K']","['Nakatsuka S', 'Takakuwa T', 'Aozasa K']","['Department of Pathology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Suita 565-0871.']",['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Japan,Rinsho Byori,Rinsho byori.

Previously, we have reported that TPO induces a characteristic pattern of apoptosis, and the TPO-induced apoptosis is closely associated with megakaryocyte (MK) differentiation. In the present study, several cytokines, flt3-ligand, stem cell factor (SCF), interleukin-3 (IL-3), IL-6, IL-11, leukemia inhibitory factor, G-CSF, and erythropoietin, which are known to affect megakaryocytopoiesis, have been evaluated to elucidate their effects on the TPO-induced apoptosis. Measurement of apoptosis by flow cytometry revealed that only SCF absolutely reduced the TPO-induced apoptosis in MK fractions, particularly in the late phase of ex vivo expansion. Platelet production was demonstrated by electron microscopy in a later phase when SCF was added. Simultaneous measurement of DNA contents with immunophenotyping demonstrated a significant increase in polyploidization in the CD41+ cell fraction when cultured with SCF. These results suggested that SCF not only inhibited premature senescence but also enhanced maturation of the differentiating cells of MK lineage during ex vivo expansion using TPO.","['Kie, Jeong-Hae', 'Yang, Woo-Ick', 'Lee, Mi-Kyung', 'Kwon, Tae-Jung', 'Min, Yoo-Hong', 'Kim, Hyun-Ok', 'Ahn, Hyo-Seop', 'Im, Seock-Ah', 'Kim, Hyung-Lae', 'Park, Hae-Young', 'Ryu, Kyung-Ha', 'Chung, Wha-Soon', 'Shin, Myeong-Heon', 'Jung, Yu-Jin', 'Woo, So-Youn', 'Park, Hae-Kyung', 'Seoh, Ju-Young']","['Kie JH', 'Yang WI', 'Lee MK', 'Kwon TJ', 'Min YH', 'Kim HO', 'Ahn HS', 'Im SA', 'Kim HL', 'Park HY', 'Ryu KH', 'Chung WS', 'Shin MH', 'Jung YJ', 'Woo SY', 'Park HK', 'Seoh JY']","['Department of Pathology, College of Medicine, Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Stem Cells,"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",9304532,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Culture Media, Serum-Free)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-11)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '0 (flt3 ligand protein)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '9014-42-0 (Thrombopoietin)']",IM,,"['Antigens, CD34/*biosynthesis', '*Apoptosis', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Culture Media, Serum-Free/pharmacology', 'Erythropoietin/biosynthesis', 'Fetal Blood/*metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/biosynthesis', 'Growth Inhibitors/biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-11/biosynthesis', 'Interleukin-3/biosynthesis', 'Interleukin-6/biosynthesis', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/biosynthesis', 'Megakaryocytes/*cytology/*metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Ploidies', 'Stem Cell Factor/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Thrombopoietin/*biosynthesis', 'Time Factors']",2002/01/18 10:00,2002/04/23 10:01,['2002/01/18 10:00'],"['2002/01/18 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/04/23 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/18 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Stem Cells. 2002;20(1):73-9. doi: 10.1634/stemcells.20-1-73.,,['10.1634/stemcells.20-1-73 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The multidrug resistance-1 (MDR1) gene product, P-glycoprotein, and the breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) are expressed differentially during hematopoiesis, with the highest levels in primitive bone marrow stem cell populations that are CD34(low) and CD34(-), respectively. Roles for ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter superfamily members in conferring drug resistance have been extensively described. However, recent hematopoietic overexpression studies have begun to reveal previously unknown roles for ABC transporter function in normal and malignant hematopoiesis. Expression of MDR1 and BCRP transporters in the myeloid lineage has been reported in blasts from acute myeloid leukemia, but very low to undetectable in normal myelomonocytic cells. Retroviral-mediated dysregulated expression of the MDR1 transporter resulted in increased hematopoietic repopulating activity and myeloproliferative disease in mice. A distinct functional role for the BCRP transporter as a negative regulator of hematopoietic repopulating activity has recently been demonstrated using the same approach. Additionally, the presence of BCRP expression specifically on hematopoietic side-population stem cells and neural stem/progenitors, makes BCRP an attractive candidate marker for isolation of stem cells with the ability to respond to diverse environmental cues. Regulation of stem cell biology by ABC transporters has emerged as an important new field of investigation. In light of these findings, it will be critical to further characterize this family of proteins in hematopoietic lineage-restricted stem cells and in pluripotent stem cells capable of crossing lineage barriers.","['Bunting, Kevin D']",['Bunting KD'],"['Hematopoiesis Department, American Red Cross Holland Laboratory, Rockville, Maryland 20855, USA. buntingk@usa.redcross.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Stem Cells,"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",9304532,"['0 (ABCG2 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2)', '0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)']",IM,,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/biosynthesis', 'ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2', 'ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/*biosynthesis', 'Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Animals', '*Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Cell Separation', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/diagnosis/metabolism', 'Mice', '*Neoplasm Proteins', 'Phenotype', 'Protein Transport', 'Stem Cells/*cytology/metabolism']",2002/01/18 10:00,2002/04/23 10:01,['2002/01/18 10:00'],"['2002/01/18 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/04/23 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/18 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Stem Cells. 2002;20(1):11-20. doi: 10.1002/stem.200011.,,['10.1002/stem.200011 [doi]'],,58,,,['Stem Cells 2002;20(3):274'],,,,,,,

Chemoresistance and late relapses are hallmarks of ALL. In this context, the question of whether ASCT is superior to CT remains unanswered. In vitro marrow purging using monoclonal antibodies is not routinely used. This review summarizes the results of ASCT for adult and childhood ALL. Statistics from the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation reveal a transplant-related mortality at 5 years of 11% +/- 1%, a relapse incidence of 60% +/- 2%, and a leukemia-free survival (LFS) and overall survival (OS) of 36% +/- 2% and 42% +/- 2%, respectively in 1,366 adults autografted in first remission (CR1). In 269 children, the LFS and OS were 50% +/- 3% and 54% +/- 3%, respectively. There was no evidence in favor of purging the autograft in vitro. In contrast, multicentric and single-institution studies have found better results in adults autografted in CR1, with LFS at 5 years from 46% to 64%, possible efficacy of marrow in vitro purging with mafosfamide (LFS 52%), and improvement in outcome with additional measures post-ASCT, such as maintenance chemotherapy (LFS 57%). Further, as already observed for AML, analyses by risk groups suggest that ASCT may essentially benefit good- but not poor-risk patients.

Studies on cultured cells have shown that growing cells have a higher LDL uptake than quiescent cells and that incubation of cells with growth factors or mitogenic compounds leads to sterol-resistant upregulation of LDL receptor gene expression. The recent finding that elevated LDL receptor activity in acute myelogenous leukemia cells was characterized by a decreased sensitivity to downregulation by sterols raises the possibility that the mechanism behind this is related to the cellular growth rate. By using cultured human fibroblasts as a model system we therefore studied whether growth modulation of sterol sensitivity takes place in normal actively growing cells. Judging from the ability of sterols (25-hydroxycholesterol + cholesterol) to inhibit 125I-LDL degradation, we found that the sensitivity to sterols varied markedly between cells of different densities. The lowest sensitivity to sterols and highest 125I-LDL degradation rate were found in subconfluent cells, whereas sparse and confluent cells were the most sensitive ones. In contrast to the LDL receptor, HMG-CoA reductase sterol sensitivity did not appear to be growth regulated. We conclude that growth-dependent modulation of sterol sensitivity and LDL receptor activity takes place in normal human fibroblasts. Modulation of sterol sensitivity may be an important mechanism to ensure an adequate cholesterol supply in growing cells.","['Tatidis, L', 'Vitols, S']","['Tatidis L', 'Vitols S']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Clinical Pharmacology, Karolinska Institute & Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Lipids,Lipids,0060450,"['0 (Hydroxycholesterols)', '0 (Receptors, LDL)', '767JTD2N31 (25-hydroxycholesterol)', '97C5T2UQ7J (Cholesterol)', 'EC 1.1.1.- (Hydroxymethylglutaryl CoA Reductases)']",IM,,"['Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cholesterol/*pharmacology', 'Fibroblasts/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydroxycholesterols/pharmacology', 'Hydroxymethylglutaryl CoA Reductases/drug effects/metabolism', 'Receptors, LDL/drug effects/genetics/*metabolism']",2002/01/25 10:00,2002/08/14 10:01,['2002/01/25 10:00'],"['2002/01/25 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/14 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/25 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Lipids. 2001 Nov;36(11):1233-40. doi: 10.1007/s11745-001-0837-y.,,['10.1007/s11745-001-0837-y [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The present study was designed to investigate the cytotoxic potential of curcumin against a range of human tumor cell lines in an attempt to understand its mechanism of action, which may lead to its possible therapeutic applications. We have shown that different cancer cell lines differ in their sensitivity to curcumin. Cell lines established from malignancies like leukemia, breast, colon, hepatocellular, and ovarian carcinomas underwent apoptosis in the presence of curcumin, whereas cell lines from lung, kidney, prostate, cervix, CNS malignancies, and melanomas showed resistance to the cytotoxic effects of curcumin. Sensitivity of the cancer cell lines to curcumin correlated with the generation of superoxide radicals as determined by the reduction of ferricytochrome C. Curcumin-resistant tumor cell lines showed significantly higher production of Hsp70, thus mounting a stress response and protecting the cells from the apoptotic cell death. These observations yield clues toward understanding the regulation of the cell death machinery by the stress proteins. Interestingly, curcumin had no effect on nontransformed cell lines, which showed neither superoxide generation nor the induction of a stress response. These observations demonstrate that curcumin is an interesting molecule with varied actions, depending on the cell type.","['Khar, A', 'Ali, A M', 'Pardhasaradhi, B V', 'Varalakshmi, C H', 'Anjum, R', 'Kumari, A L']","['Khar A', 'Ali AM', 'Pardhasaradhi BV', 'Varalakshmi CH', 'Anjum R', 'Kumari AL']","['Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology, Hyderabad, India. khar@ccmb.ap.nic.in']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Cell Stress Chaperones,Cell stress & chaperones,9610925,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (fas Receptor)', 'IT942ZTH98 (Curcumin)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Breast Neoplasms/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Line', 'Colonic Neoplasms/metabolism/pathology', 'Curcumin/*pharmacology', 'Cytoprotection', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Fibroblasts/drug effects/metabolism', 'HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/metabolism/pathology', 'Liver Neoplasms/metabolism/pathology', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/metabolism/pathology', 'Rats', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'fas Receptor/metabolism']",2002/01/25 10:00,2002/08/03 10:01,['2002/01/25 10:00'],"['2002/01/25 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/03 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/25 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cell Stress Chaperones. 2001 Oct;6(4):368-76. doi: 10.1379/1466-1268(2001)006<0368:iosrrh>2.0.co;2.,,['10.1379/1466-1268(2001)006<0368:iosrrh>2.0.co;2 [doi]'],,,,,,,PMC434420,,,,,

Similarly, smooth muscle cells in vitro treated with LIF exhibited a time-dependent reduction in LIFR-alpha protein expression and the subsequent reduction in transcription of the TIMP-1 gene. However, in the presence of an intact endothelium, LIFR-alpha was upregulated in response to LIF, and accordingly the downstream induction of iNOS expression was also increased.

Four of the 16 non-DS patients were found to have acquired an extra chromosome 21 in their leukemia cells: blasts from these patients also tended to have greater chemosensitivity than those from patients without an extra chromosome 21. Blast cells from DS patients are markedly sensitive to various drugs.

Testing for the presence of t(11;14), the hallmark of MCL, revealed multiple copies of the fusion signals. We therefore conducted extensive molecular cytogenetic studies to delineate the nature and consequences of such an abnormality. We localized the amplification to the der(14)t(11;14) and to a der(2) chromosome in a form of interspersed chromosome 11 and 14 material. This resulted in high expression of cyclin D1 mRNA and the protein expressed independently of the cell cycle phase. CGH analysis revealed that the overrepresentation on chromosome 11 included chromosomal band 11q23 in addition to the CCND1 locus at 11q13. The band 11q23 harbors the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) gene recently proposed to be involved in the pathogenesis of MCL with high incidence of deletions in this locus. Using YAC 801e11, containing the ATM gene, we demonstrated several hybridization signals, suggesting that this region also formed part of the amplicon. This case also showed TP53 gene abnormalities: protein expression, monoallelic deletion, and a mutation in exon 5. The clinical course was aggressive, and the patient died within 6 months of presentation.

High-resolution allelotyping performed in our laboratory showed new chromosomal sites of nonrandom deletions. We have focused our work on 8q12 deletions, which we have found in about 4% of patients (eight of 205 informative cases). These deletions were of small size (less than 1 Mb) in all but one patient, and the deleted region common to all patients was delineated between two microsatellite markers (D8S1113 and D8S1763). This region was sequenced entirely from two overlapping bacterial artificial chromosomes. The common deleted region (120 kb) had a low GC content (37%), was composed more than 50% of LINE sequences, and contained only two candidate genes. The centromeric deletion borders were clustered within an interval of 33 kb between two microsatellite markers. This interval contains the first exon of an HMG-1-related gene (KIAA0808) and a putative gene, DL8q12, predicted to encode a protein with 231 amino acid residues with no homolog in protein databases. Analysis of the available mRNA from lymphoblastic cells of two patients with 8q12 deletions using common polymorphisms in the 3' UTR of KIAA0808 showed monoallelic expression of this gene. Identification of a biallelic polymorphism in the first exon of DL8q12 showed that this gene was deleted in two of four informative cases. Sequencing of the exons of both genes from all patients with 8q12 deletions did not show any mutation, which suggests that neither of these genes behaves as a classic tumor suppressor gene.","['Bardet, Valerie', 'Couque, Nathalie', 'Cattolico, Laurence', 'Hetet, Gilles', 'Devaux, Isabelle', 'Duprat, Simone', 'Gressin, Laetitia', 'Vilmer, Etienne', 'Cave, Helene', 'Grandchamp, Bernard']","['Bardet V', 'Couque N', 'Cattolico L', 'Hetet G', 'Devaux I', 'Duprat S', 'Gressin L', 'Vilmer E', 'Cave H', 'Grandchamp B']","['INSERM U409, Universite Paris 7 and Centre Claude Bernard, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Alleles', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8/*genetics', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Female', 'Gene Silencing', 'Genes, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Sequence Deletion/genetics']",2002/01/17 10:00,2002/02/01 10:01,['2002/01/17 10:00'],"['2002/01/17 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/01 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/17 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2002 Feb;33(2):178-87. doi: 10.1002/gcc.10014.,,"['10.1002/gcc.10014 [pii]', '10.1002/gcc.10014 [doi]']",,,,"['Copyright 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,"['GENBANK/AJ315949', 'GENBANK/AL513406']",,,,

To provide exposure data to aid in the interpretation of these findings, extremely and very low frequency (ELF and VLF) magnetic fields produced by a sample of each type of appliance were characterized in a field study of volunteers conducted in Washington DC and its Maryland suburbs. Questionnaire data regarding children's or mothers' patterns of usage of each type of appliance were also collected. ELF magnetic fields measured 10 cm from the nozzles of hair dryers were elevated over the ambient by a mean factor of 17 when these devices were in use. Fields near headsets being used to listen to music were not distinguishable from ambient levels except at frequencies below and well above 60 Hz and, even then, field levels were < 0.01 microT. Home sewing machines produced ELF magnetic fields that were elevated by a factor of 2.8 over ambient levels at the front surfaces of the lower abdomens of mothers. Estimated mean daily times of usage of hair dryers, stereo headsets, and sewing machines were 2.6, 19, and 17 minutes, respectively. These data and previously published data on TV sets, do not provide a consistent picture of increased (or decreased) leukemia risk in relation to increasing peak or time weighted average (TWA) ELF magnetic field exposure. The data could, however, conceivably be compatible with some more complex biophysical model with unknown properties. Overall, the results of this study provide little evidence supporting the hypothesis that peak or TWA ELF magnetic fields produced by appliances are causally related to the risk of childhood leukemia in children.","['Kaune, W T', 'Miller, M C', 'Linet, M S', 'Hatch, E E', 'Kleinerman, R A', 'Wacholder, S', 'Mohr, A H', 'Tarone, R E', 'Haines, C']","['Kaune WT', 'Miller MC', 'Linet MS', 'Hatch EE', 'Kleinerman RA', 'Wacholder S', 'Mohr AH', 'Tarone RE', 'Haines C']","['EM Factors, Richland, Washington, USA. wtkaune@ieee.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Bioelectromagnetics,Bioelectromagnetics,8008281,,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Electronics/instrumentation', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/etiology', 'Magnetics/*adverse effects', 'Pregnancy', 'Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects', 'Risk Factors', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",2002/01/17 10:00,2002/03/05 10:01,['2002/01/17 10:00'],"['2002/01/17 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/05 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/17 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Bioelectromagnetics. 2002 Jan;23(1):14-25. doi: 10.1002/bem.94.,,"['10.1002/bem.94 [pii]', '10.1002/bem.94 [doi]']",,,,"['Copyright 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,['N01-CP-81121/CP/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,

With the expanding use of ports, new and more frequent complications are being encountered. To retrospectively review the complications associated with ports, the case notes of all patients who underwent insertion of a port between 1997 and 2000 were analysed. Details of the underlying disorder, type of vascular device, nature of use, and complications were recorded; 55 ports were inserted in 41 patients (a second port was required in 12, a third port in 2) during this period. Their underlying diagnoses were CF (11), haemophilia (4), haemolytic anaemias (2), immunological disorders (6), solid neoplasms (8), and leukaemia (10). Thirteen ports (24%) were removed and replaced for various complications: infection (2), blockage (4), leak (2), dislodgement (2), and malposition (3). Including four port-related problems managed conservatively (3 access problems managed by change in access technique; 1 blockage managed by urokinase), the over all complication rate was 31%. Ports thus have a high complication rate with long-term use.

In chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), neoplastic macrophages are presumably responsible for the expansion of the leukemic cell clone. So far, no information is available about a persistence of host-type macrophages after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) implicating a lineage-specific mixed chimerism. METHODS: Bone marrow trephine biopsies were investigated in eight male and five female patients with CML after BMT after a sex-mismatched host/donor constellation. Techniques included immunophenotyping (CD68) for identification of resident macrophages and a simultaneous genotyping with X- and Y-chromosome-specific DNA-probes (fluorescence in situ hybridization). Normal bone marrow and specimens of CML patients before BMT served as controls. RESULTS: Contrasting an almost 100% congruence with the genotyping in the controls, a mixed chimerism of the CD68+ macrophages and the other host myeloid cells was found. Until 3 months after BMT, incidence of host-type macrophages ranged from 8% to 10%. This feature was also identifiable in the peculiar subset of pseudo-Gaucher cells (PGCs). The number of host-type macrophages failed to decline significantly during the early posttransplant period, because after almost 4 months these were still detectable. On the other hand, in patients showing an initial-to-manifest leukemic relapse, an insidious conversion of up to 50% from the donor to host-type macrophages and myeloid cells occurred. CONCLUSIONS: The CD68+ resident bone marrow macrophage population including PGCs are involved in the lineage-specific chimerism and minimal residual disease after BMT in CML.","['Wickenhauser, Claudia', 'Thiele, Juergen', 'Perez, Fernando', 'Varus, Eva', 'Stoffel, Marc Sebastian', 'Kvasnicka, Hans Michael', 'Beelen, Dietrich Wilhelm', 'Schaefer, Ullrich Wilhelm']","['Wickenhauser C', 'Thiele J', 'Perez F', 'Varus E', 'Stoffel MS', 'Kvasnicka HM', 'Beelen DW', 'Schaefer UW']","['Institute of Pathology, University of Cologne, Joseph-Stelzmannstr. 9, D-50924 Cologne, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Transplantation,Transplantation,0132144,,IM,,"['Biopsy, Needle', 'Bone Marrow Cells/pathology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*immunology/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/pathology/*therapy', 'Macrophages/pathology', 'Male', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', '*Transplantation Chimera', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'X Chromosome', 'Y Chromosome']",2002/01/17 10:00,2002/02/14 10:01,['2002/01/17 10:00'],"['2002/01/17 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/14 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/17 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Transplantation. 2002 Jan 15;73(1):104-11. doi: 10.1097/00007890-200201150-00020.,,['10.1097/00007890-200201150-00020 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

We examined whether the genotypes of the glutathione S-transferases (GST) M1 and T1, which metabolize various cytostatic drugs, as well as reactive oxygen species, influence the risk for secondary neoplasia. In a retrospective study, we analyzed peripheral blood lymphocyte or bone marrow DNA samples from 213 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and 128 with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) 44 of whom suffered from therapy-associated AML/MDS. The control group consisted of 239 healthy individuals with comparable composition as to race and sex. GSTM1 and GSTT1 were analyzed by multiplex PCR. Comparison between patients and control group revealed a significant (P=0.0003) overrepresentation of combined deletions of both GSTM1 and GSTT1 (double null genotype) in the group of patients with AML/MDS secondary to chemo- and/or radiotherapy of a carcinoma of the breast. In this group, 55% of the patients displayed the double null genotype as compared with 8.8% in the control group. We conclude that patients with carcinoma of the breast and inheritance of a combined gene deletion of GSTM1 and GSTT1 might bear an increased risk to develop a secondary therapy-induced hematologic neoplasia.

Measurement of antibody serum levels is important for optimising dose regimens but difficult owing to the low concentration compared with normal human IgG. After consideration of various methods, a suitable assay was developed based on indirect immunofluorescence. Test samples were incubated with target cells (HUT-78, a human T cell line) and the CAMPATH-1H was detected by binding of a fluorescent-labelled anti-human Ig using a flow cytometer. Robustness of the assay was demonstrated under a range of experimental conditions. Because of the low affinity of CAMPATH-1H, only a weak signal was seen at low concentrations. The limit of detection was 0.15 microg/ml and the limit of quantitation was 0.25 microg/ml. Since serum samples were diluted at least 1:2, the lowest concentration which can be measured in patient serum was 0.5 microg/ml. The overall precision (coefficient of variation) was +/-13% and the overall accuracy (bias) was +9%. There was a low incidence of false-positive results (<2%) in normal or pre-treatment patient serum. Quantitative recovery was obtained from serum samples spiked with CAMPATH-1H and stored under a variety of conditions, including being treated at 56 degrees C for 30 min and frozen and thawed up to four times. This validated assay is suitable for the measurement of CAMPATH-1H levels in clinical trials and the same principles may be applied to any other cell-binding monoclonal antibody.","['Rebello, Peppy', 'Hale, Geoff']","['Rebello P', 'Hale G']","['Sir William Dunn School of Pathology, University of Oxford, South Parks Road, OX1 3RE, Oxford, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,J Immunol Methods,Journal of immunological methods,1305440,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CD52 Antigen)', '0 (CD52 protein, human)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '3A189DH42V (Alemtuzumab)']",IM,,"['Alemtuzumab', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*pharmacokinetics', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm', 'Antigens, CD/immunology', '*Antigens, Neoplasm', 'Antineoplastic Agents/blood/*pharmacokinetics', '*Biological Assay', 'CD52 Antigen', 'Drug Monitoring/*methods', 'Glycoproteins/immunology', 'Humans', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",2002/01/17 10:00,2002/03/02 10:01,['2002/01/17 10:00'],"['2002/01/17 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/02 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/17 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol Methods. 2002 Feb 1;260(1-2):285-302. doi: 10.1016/s0022-1759(01)00556-7.,,"['S0022175901005567 [pii]', '10.1016/s0022-1759(01)00556-7 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

This sandwich ELISA uses a combination of a monoclonal antibody (mcp 20) recognizing the C2-beta subunit of human 20S proteasome (Mr approximately 30,000) and a polyclonal rabbit anti-20S antibody which labels different subunits of the complex. The detection limit of the assay was established as 10 ng/ml (n=10, mean of zero standard+2 S.D.) and the recovery rate ranged from 96% to 104%. The within-run and between-run coefficients of variation (CV) ranges were 2.8-3.3 and 3.0-3.4, respectively. Using serial dilutions of plasma to which various amounts of purified 20S proteasome were added, a linear dose-response was observed between 102 and 2050 ng/ml with a slope of 1.004 and a coefficient of determination r(2) of 0.99. In a preliminary experiment performed on a limited number of patients, the present assay was used to quantify the 20S proteasome in plasma from healthy subjects (n=11) and from a limited number of patients with various diseases (two patients with each of the following diagnoses: acute myeloid leukaemia, chronic myeloproliferative syndromes, Hodgkin's disease and solid tumors). The average concentration of 20S proteasome in plasma from normal subjects was found to be 2319+/-237 ng/ml (n=11). With reference to this normal range, the plasma proteasome concentration was found to be increased in most of these pathological state and as high as 1200% when solid tumors had been detected. For patients with Hodgkin's disease, the changes were more variable whereas in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, the proteasome concentration was raised during the acute phase of disease and decreased during therapy. We suggest that this robust, accurate and highly reproducible assay could be used to quantify proteasome in human plasma and investigate its value as a biological marker for various malignant and nonmalignant diseases.","['Dutaud, Dominique', 'Aubry, Laurent', 'Henry, Laurent', 'Levieux, Didier', 'Hendil, Klavs B', 'Kuehn, Lothar', 'Bureau, Jean Paul', 'Ouali, Ahmed']","['Dutaud D', 'Aubry L', 'Henry L', 'Levieux D', 'Hendil KB', 'Kuehn L', 'Bureau JP', 'Ouali A']","['Biochemistry Team, SRV, INRA Theix, 63122 Saint Genes Champanelle, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,J Immunol Methods,Journal of immunological methods,1305440,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Multienzyme Complexes)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Biomarkers', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/*blood/immunology', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay/*methods', 'Hodgkin Disease/blood', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood', 'Multienzyme Complexes/*blood/immunology', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex', 'Rabbits', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",2002/01/17 10:00,2002/03/02 10:01,['2002/01/17 10:00'],"['2002/01/17 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/02 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/17 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol Methods. 2002 Feb 1;260(1-2):183-93. doi: 10.1016/s0022-1759(01)00555-5.,,"['S0022175901005555 [pii]', '10.1016/s0022-1759(01)00555-5 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

A conjugate of a calicheamicin hydrazide derivative attached via hydrazone formation to the oxidized carbohydrates of the anti-CD33 murine antibody P67.6 had been chosen for use in AML prior to humanization of this antibody. However, the CDR-grafted humanized P67.6 could not be used to make the carbohydrate conjugate because of the unexpected sensitivity of this antibody to periodate oxidation. Exploration of a series of bifunctional linkers resulted in a new class of calicheamicin conjugates, termed the hybrid conjugates, that allows for the attachment of the calicheamicin to lysines but incorporates the site of hydrolytic release, a hydrazone, previously shown to be required for activity. The optimized conjugate chosen for clinical trials, gemtuzumab ozogamicin (""gem-ozo"", Mylotarg, formerly designated CMA-676), was significantly more potent and selective than the carbohydrate conjugate it replaced. It was selectively cytotoxic to HL-60 leukemia cells in tissue culture with an IC(50) in the low to sub-pg cal/mL range (cal = calicheamicin equivalents). Doses of gem-ozo as low as 50 microg cal/kg given three times to mice bearing HL-60 xenografts routinely resulted in long-term, tumor-free survivors, while a nonbinding control conjugate was relatively inactive. Gem-ozo at a concentration of 2 to 10 ng cal/mL selectively inhibited leukemia colony formation by marrow cells from a significant proportion of AML patients. Gem-ozo has also shown significant activity against AML in Phase II trials and is the first antibody-targeted chemotherapeutic agent approved by the FDA.","['Hamann, Philip R', 'Hinman, Lois M', 'Hollander, Irwin', 'Beyer, Carl F', 'Lindh, Delores', 'Holcomb, Ryan', 'Hallett, William', 'Tsou, Hwei-Ru', 'Upeslacis, Janis', 'Shochat, Dan', 'Mountain, Andrew', 'Flowers, David A', 'Bernstein, Irwin']","['Hamann PR', 'Hinman LM', 'Hollander I', 'Beyer CF', 'Lindh D', 'Holcomb R', 'Hallett W', 'Tsou HR', 'Upeslacis J', 'Shochat D', 'Mountain A', 'Flowers DA', 'Bernstein I']","['Wyeth-Ayerst Research, 401 North Middletown Road, Pearl River, New York 10965, USA. hamannp@war.wyeth.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Bioconjug Chem,Bioconjugate chemistry,9010319,"['0 (Aminoglycosides)', '0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (CD33 protein, human)', '0 (Cd33 protein, mouse)', '0 (Cross-Linking Reagents)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '0 (Indicators and Reagents)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3)', '93NS566KF7 (Gemtuzumab)']",IM,,"['Acute Disease', '*Aminoglycosides', 'Animals', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antigens, CD/*immunology', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/*immunology', 'Cross-Linking Reagents', 'Gemtuzumab', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunotoxins/*therapeutic use', 'Indicators and Reagents', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/01/17 10:00,2002/04/06 10:01,['2002/01/17 10:00'],"['2002/01/17 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/04/06 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/17 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Bioconjug Chem. 2002 Jan-Feb;13(1):47-58. doi: 10.1021/bc010021y.,,"['bc010021y [pii]', '10.1021/bc010021y [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Choice of linker.,40-6,"The anti-CD33 antibody, P67.6, has been chosen to target the potently cytotoxic calicheamicin antitumor antibiotics to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) due to the presence of CD33 on >80% of patient samples and its lack of expression outside the myeloid cell lineages, especially its lack of expression on pluripotent stem cells. Previous calicheamicin conjugates relied on the attachment of a hydrazide derivative to the oxidized carbohydrates that occur naturally on antibodies. This results in a ""carbohydrate conjugate"" capable of releasing active drug by hydrolysis of a hydrazone bond in the lysozomes where the pH is low. Conjugates have now been made that are formed by reacting a calicheamicin derivative containing an activated ester with the lysines of antibodies. This results in an ""amide conjugate"" that is stable to hydrolysis, leaving the disulfide that is present in all calicheamicin conjugates as the likely site of drug release from the conjugate. In this article, these two classes of calicheamicin-antibody conjugates are compared for potential use in AML with the anti-CD33 antibody P67.6. Conjugates of P67.6 are shown to require the site of hydrolytic release afforded by the carbohydrate conjugates in order to retain good potency and selectivity in vitro, in vivo, and ex vivo. The P67.6 carbohydrate conjugate of calicheamicin is selectively cytotoxic at <0.006 ng/mL of calicheamicin equivalents (cal equiv) toward HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells in tissue culture. Long-term, tumor-free survivors are seen in xenograft models when mice bearing HL-60 subcutaneous tumors are treated with the P67.6 carbohydrate conjugate at a dose of 300 microg/kg cal equiv given three times.

The oncogenic tyrosine kinase Bcr-Abl has been shown to activate Rac-1, which is important for Bcr-Abl induced leukemogenesis. Previous studies by Matsuguchi et al. (Matsuguchi, T., Inhorn, R. C., Carlesso, N., Xu, G., Druker, B., and Griffin, J. D. (1995) EMBO J. 14, 257-265) describe enhanced phosphorylation of Vav in Bcr-Abl-expressing Mo7e cells yet fail to demonstrate association of the two proteins. Here, we report the identification of a direct complex between Vav and Bcr-Abl in yeast, in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we show tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav by Bcr-Abl. Mutational analysis revealed that the SH2 domain and the C-terminal SH3 domain as well as a tetraproline motif directly adjacent to the N-terminal SH3 domain of Vav are important for establishing this phosphotyrosine dependent interaction. Activation of Rac-1 by Bcr-Abl was abrogated by co-expression of the Vav C terminus encoding the SH3-SH2-SH3 domains as a dominant negative construct. Bcr-Abl transduced primary bone marrow from Vav knock-out mice showed reduced proliferation in a culture cell transformation assay compared with wild-type bone marrow. These results suggest, that Bcr-Abl utilizes Vav as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor to activate Rac-1 in a process that involves a folding mechanism of the Vav C terminus. Given the importance of Rac-1 activation for Bcr-Abl-mediated leukemogenesis, this mechanism may be crucial for the molecular pathogenesis of chronic myeloid leukemia and of importance for other signal transduction pathways leading to the activation of Rac-1.","['Bassermann, Florian', 'Jahn, Thomas', 'Miething, Cornelius', 'Seipel, Petra', 'Bai, Ren-Yuan', 'Coutinho, Sunita', 'Tybulewicz, Victor L', 'Peschel, Christian', 'Duyster, Justus']","['Bassermann F', 'Jahn T', 'Miething C', 'Seipel P', 'Bai RY', 'Coutinho S', 'Tybulewicz VL', 'Peschel C', 'Duyster J']","['Department of Internal Medicine III, Laboratory of Leukemogenesis, Technical University of Munich, 81675, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-vav)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (VAV1 protein, human)', '0 (Vav1 protein, mouse)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', '9DLQ4CIU6V (Proline)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rac1 GTP-Binding Protein)']",IM,,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism', '*Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Line', 'DNA, Complementary/metabolism', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*chemistry/*metabolism', 'Genes, Dominant', 'Glutathione Transferase/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Phosphorylation', 'Plasmids/metabolism', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Proline/chemistry', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-vav', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Temperature', 'Transfection', 'Two-Hybrid System Techniques', 'Tyrosine/metabolism', 'rac1 GTP-Binding Protein/*metabolism', 'src Homology Domains']",2002/01/16 10:00,2002/05/15 10:01,['2002/01/16 10:00'],"['2002/01/16 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/05/15 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/16 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2002 Apr 5;277(14):12437-45. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M112397200.

Young patients, in particular, have attracted recent interest as it has become apparent that age alone is a poor prognostic indicator for breast cancer. Adjuvant therapies indisputably delay breast cancer recurrence and save lives, and should be considered for all young patients. Chemotherapy is increasingly being considered appropriate for all women under the age of 35 years, regardless of other risk factors, but poses the particularly difficult problem of infertility for these young women. As the additional benefits of anthracyclines and taxanes in the adjuvant setting become clear, chemotherapy regimens are also becoming increasingly intensive and the risk of myocardial damage and leukaemia should not be ignored. The benefits of chemotherapy need to be weighed against the possible dangers, and therapy should be individualised according to cancer pathology and patient circumstance. Tamoxifen should be given for 5 years to all women whose cancer is estrogen receptor positive, regardless of whether the patient has received chemotherapy. If chemotherapy is not given, the addition of luteinising hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists to tamoxifen in patients with estrogen receptor positive breast cancers appears to be beneficial. The addition of LHRH agonists to chemotherapy and tamoxifen is currently being evaluated in randomised trials. Radiotherapy should be given after breast conservation surgery, and should include the axilla if nodes are involved and the axilla has not been surgically cleared. Chest wall radiotherapy should be considered following mastectomy in young women considered at high risk of local recurrence, but the long-term morbidity and mortality of local radiation therapy, which is increased in young women, needs to be considered.","['Clive, Sally', 'Dixon, J Michael']","['Clive S', 'Dixon JM']","['Department of Oncology, Western General Hospital, Edinburgh, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",New Zealand,Drugs,Drugs,7600076,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy', '*Chemotherapy, Adjuvant/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans']",2002/01/16 10:00,2002/03/23 10:01,['2002/01/16 10:00'],"['2002/01/16 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/23 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/16 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Drugs. 2002;62(1):1-11. doi: 10.2165/00003495-200262010-00001.,,"['620101 [pii]', '10.2165/00003495-200262010-00001 [doi]']",,80,,,,,,,,,,

They are caused by the tumour itself and by application of chemotherapy, surgery, radiation or cytokine treatment. Exhaustion and tiredness are not a consequence of lacking sleep or exaggerated physical or mental labour, but are due to several other factors: Anemia, tumour cachexia, toxicity of chemo- and radiation treatment probably are the most decisive factors for the development of exhaustion and tiredness. As both were taken as inevitable side-effects of cancer and cancer treatment in the past, only little attention has been paid to exhaustion and tiredness and limited research has been done. Among several validated questionnaires measuring quality of life in tumour patients the FACT-An (Functional Assessment of Cancer Treatment--Anemia) and EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire are the most well-known for identifying exhaustion and tiredness. Nevertheless, until today there is no mere exhaustion scale exclusively dealing with the problem of exhaustion and tiredness. According to the 10th revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) exhaustion and tiredness are subsumed under the diagnosis of tumour fatigue. In contrast to tumour fatigue, which comprises physical, mental and emotional dimensions, exhaustion and tiredness primarily refer to physical symptoms: Lacking resilience for activities of daily life, day sleepiness and nocturnal insomnia as well as restricted power of concentration are the mainstays of exhaustion and tiredness. However, regarding lacking interests, diminished energy and reduced mental capacity, exhaustion and fatigue partly overlap. From a therapeutic point of view behavioural interventions and drug therapy have successfully been tried. Beside physical exercise and psychostimulants application of Erythropoietin represents an innovative treatment of exhaustion and tiredness.","['Zahner, J', 'Meran, J', 'Karthaus, M']","['Zahner J', 'Meran J', 'Karthaus M']","['Abteilung Medizin und Forschung, Janssen-Cilag GmbH, D-41470 Neuss, Deutschland. jzahner@jacde.jhj.com']",['ger'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Austria,Wien Med Wochenschr,Wiener medizinische Wochenschrift (1946),8708475,"['0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)']",IM,,"['Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Erythropoietin/therapeutic use', 'Fatigue/etiology/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/complications/*therapy', 'Neoplasms/complications/*therapy', '*Palliative Care', 'Quality of Life', 'Recombinant Proteins']",2002/01/16 10:00,2002/02/23 10:01,['2002/01/16 10:00'],"['2002/01/16 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/23 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/16 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Wien Med Wochenschr. 2001;151(3-4):89-93.,,,,59,Erschopfung und Mudigkeit--ein vernachlassigtes Problem in der Hamatoonkologie.,,,,,,,,,

Over the last ten years chemotherapy for solid tumors has shifted out of the hospital setting into the ambit of community-based oncologists, and outpatient treatment with complex multidrug protocols has become more and more common. With the increase in the numbers of outpatients undergoing multidrug chemotherapy there has been a corresponding rise in the severity and duration of neutropenia and in the increase of febrile complications. Risk-assessment models have been developed that differentiate febrile patients with neutropenia according to their risk for infectious complications and/or mortality. Patients with neutropenia of short duration (< 7 days) and fever are at relatively low risk for complications if they have no concurrent comorbidities, and in these circumstances outpatient antibiotic treatment is an alternative to costly hospitalization. Drugs whose antimicrobial coverage and pharmacokinetics render them particularly suitable for outpatient treatment of febrile neutropenia include intravenous and oral quinolones and, for once-daily dosing, intravenous glycopeptides, ceftriaxone and intravenous aminoglycosides.

The patient was treated with the ProMACE-CytaBOM protocol. During treatment Hepatitis B was reactivated and after termination, of chemotherapy she developed fulminant hepatitis with hyperbilirubinemia, coagulopathy, hypoalbuminemia and ascites. The second case is that of a 34 years old male with a diagnosis of T-ALL who was treated according to the BFM 95 protocol. He had reactivation of Hepatitis B during induction therapy. These two patients were treated with Lamivudine with resolution of the hepatitis and disappearance of HBV DNA from the sera. Prophylactic administration of Lamivudine enabled reinduction of chemotherapy in the first case after relapse of the lymphoma and continuation of BFM 95 protocol in the second patient. Lamivudine inhibits replication of hepatitis B virus and prevents reactivation of Hepatitis B during immunosuppression induced by chemotherapy and probably ameliorates the severity of already reactivated hepatitis.","['Shtalrid, M', 'Haran, M', 'Klepfish, A', 'Lurie, Y', 'Malnick, S']","['Shtalrid M', 'Haran M', 'Klepfish A', 'Lurie Y', 'Malnick S']",,['heb'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Israel,Harefuah,Harefuah,0034351,"['0 (Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '11056-06-7 (Bleomycin)', '2T8Q726O95 (Lamivudine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)', 'PROMACE-CytaBOM protocol']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Bleomycin/administration & dosage', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Hepatitis B/*drug therapy', 'Hepatitis B virus/drug effects/*growth & development', 'Humans', 'Lamivudine/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage', 'Virus Activation/*drug effects']",2002/01/16 10:00,2002/02/16 10:01,['2002/01/16 10:00'],"['2002/01/16 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/16 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/16 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,"Harefuah. 2001 Dec;140(12):1159-62, 1230, 1229.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A reevaluation of prophylactic platelet transfusions.,34-45,"The purpose of this study was to determine which clinical and laboratory features correlate with serious hemorrhage in thrombocytopenic oncology patients. A retrospective review was conducted of all thrombocytopenic adult patients admitted to the Johns Hopkins Oncology Center, Baltimore, MD, over the last 10 years. We performed multiple logistic regression analysis on 2942 patients looking at the frequency of serious bleeding as a function of platelet count and numerous features that may correlate with hemorrhage. Multivariate analyses showed no relationship between either the first morning platelet count or the lowest platelet count of the day and the risk of hemorrhage. Of the other features we examined, several correlated independently with bleeding, including uremia (odds ratio [OR] 1.64; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.40 to 1.92), hypoalbuminemia (OR 1.54; 95% CI, 1.33 to 1.79), recent bone marrow transplantation (OR 1.32; 95% CI, 1.22 to 1.43), and recent hemorrhage (OR 6.72; 95% CI, 5.53 to 8.18). Leukopenia was associated with a decreased risk of bleeding (OR 0.70; 95% CI, 0.60 to 0.82). Although this large study identified a number of clinical and laboratory features that correlated significantly with bleeding, the ORs of these factors were not large and all were much less than previous bleeding. These findings suggest that the major goal of transfusion support should be the aggressive therapeutic use of blood products rather than prophylactic use based on such weak clinical correlates and on the platelet count, which was not a correlate at all in multivariate analysis.","['Friedmann, Alison M', 'Sengul, Haydar', 'Lehmann, Harold', 'Schwartz, Cindy', 'Goodman, Steven']","['Friedmann AM', 'Sengul H', 'Lehmann H', 'Schwartz C', 'Goodman S']","['Johns Hopkins Hospital, Baltimore, MD, USA.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Transfus Med Rev,Transfusion medicine reviews,8709027,['0 (Serum Albumin)'],IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Bacteremia/complications', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cohort Studies', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/blood/complications', 'Hemorrhage/*epidemiology/etiology/prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/blood/complications/therapy', 'Leukopenia/epidemiology', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neoplasms/blood/*complications', 'Odds Ratio', '*Platelet Count', '*Platelet Transfusion/statistics & numerical data', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Regression Analysis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Serum Albumin/deficiency', 'Thrombocytopenia/chemically induced/*complications/diagnosis/etiology', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Uremia/complications']",2002/01/15 10:00,2002/04/16 10:01,['2002/01/15 10:00'],"['2002/01/15 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/04/16 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/15 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Transfus Med Rev. 2002 Jan;16(1):34-45. doi: 10.1053/tmrv.2002.29403.,,"['S0887796302500031 [pii]', '10.1053/tmrv.2002.29403 [doi]']",,33,,['Copyright 2002 by W.B.

We found that ATRA induced the 4-fold elevation of acid sphingomyelinase (ASMase) activity 24 h after treatment in NB4 cells, but not in NB4/RA cells. ATRA did not affect neutral sphingomyelinase activity in either NB4 or NB4/RA. Upon treatment with ATRA, ceramide, the product of an ASMase reaction, accumulated in NB4 cells. Northern blot analysis showed a marked elevation of the ASMase mRNA 8 h after ATRA treatment, reaching a plateau at 24 h. Regulation of ASMase gene expression was studied by a promoter analysis using luciferase reporter assay. The 5'-upstream flanking region of human ASMase gene (-519/+300) conjugated with the luciferase gene was introduced into COS-7 cells. Luciferase activity in transformed cells markedly increased in response to ATRA stimulation when the wild type RARalpha or the PML/RARalpha hybrid protein was co-expressed. Deletion experiments revealed that a short sequence at the 5'-end (-519/-485) was indispensable for the ATRA response. Within this short region, two retinoic acid-responsive element-like motifs (TGCCCG and TCTCCT) and one AP2-like motif (CCCTTCCC) were identified. Deletion and base-substitution experiments showed that all three motifs are required for the full expression induced by ATRA.

Therefore, an in vitro assay that can rapidly, safely, and accurately evaluate the NAb response vaccine candidates elicit, especially against a large number of HIV-1 variants, would be highly valuable. It has been demonstrated that HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein lacking the cytoplasmic domain can pseudotype murine leukemia virus encoding the beta-galactosidase gene and that this pseudovirus can specifically infect CD4(+) cells (Schnierle BS, Stitz J, Bosch V, et al.: Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 1997;94:8640-8645). Because the pseudovirus is not biohazardous and because the infection can be quantitatively determined within 2 days, we examined the feasibility of using the pseudovirus for high-throughput neutralization assays for HIV-1. We have generated viruses pseudotyped with gp140 of six different HIV-1 isolates (LAI, RF, Bal, AD8, 89.6, and DH12). All six pseudoviruses were infectious and exhibited expected coreceptor usage phenotype in HOS-CD4 cells expressing either CCR5 or CXCR4. More importantly, the neutralization sensitivity profile of these pseudoviruses was virtually identical to that observed from more conventional neutralization assays using either HIV-1 or SHIV. All pseudoviruses could be neutralized by broadly reactive human monoclonal antibody IgG1 b12. Our results indicate that the pseudoviruses are ideal for high-throughput evaluation of immune sera for their capacity to broadly neutralize a large number of HIV-1 isolates.","['Kim, Y B', 'Lee, M K', 'Han, D P', 'Cho, M W']","['Kim YB', 'Lee MK', 'Han DP', 'Cho MW']","['Laboratory of Molecular Microbiology, NIAID, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses,AIDS research and human retroviruses,8709376,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (HIV Envelope Protein gp120)']",IM,,"['Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cytoplasm/*immunology', 'DNA Primers', 'HIV Envelope Protein gp120/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*immunology', '*Neutralization Tests']",2002/01/15 10:00,2002/02/14 10:01,['2002/01/15 10:00'],"['2002/01/15 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/14 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/15 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses. 2001 Dec 10;17(18):1715-24. doi: 10.1089/08892220152741414.,,['10.1089/08892220152741414 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Results showed in Gel mobility shift assays that GATA factors could specifically bind to the regulatory elements of human beta-globin gene, including the proximal regulatory element (the beta-promoter) and the distal regulatory elements (the DNase I hypersensitive sites in the LCR, HS2-HS4 core sequences). However, the DNA binding patterns of GATA factors were quite different between HU-induced and uninduced HEL cells. Western-blot analysis of nuclear extracts from both the uninduced and HU-induced HEL cells revealed that the level of GATA-2 transcription factor decreased, whereas the level of GATA-1 transcription factor increased following the time of hydroxyurea induction. Furthermore, using RT-PCR analysis the expression of human beta-globin gene in HU-induced HEL cells could be blocked again when HEL cells were incubated in the presence of antisense oligonucleotides for hGATA-1, suggesting that the upregulation of hGATA-1 transcription factor might be critical for the expression of human beta-globin gene in HU-induced HEL cells.","['Zhang, S B', 'He, Q Y', 'Zhao, H', 'Gui, C Y', 'Jiang, C', 'Qian, R L']","['Zhang SB', 'He QY', 'Zhao H', 'Gui CY', 'Jiang C', 'Qian RL']","['Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cell Res,Cell research,9425763,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors)', '0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA1 protein, human)', '0 (GATA2 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA2 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",IM,,"['Cell Differentiation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*physiology', 'Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor', 'GATA2 Transcription Factor', 'Globins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Locus Control Region', 'Models, Molecular', 'Transcription Factors/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/01/15 10:00,2002/08/07 10:01,['2002/01/15 10:00'],"['2002/01/15 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/07 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/15 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cell Res. 2001 Dec;11(4):301-10. doi: 10.1038/sj.cr.7290100.,,['10.1038/sj.cr.7290100 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Such promising methods of treatment include the new chemotherapeutic drugs, new molecules that specifically act on the level molecular mechanisms (STI 571, ATRA, arsenic trioxide, etc.), immunotherapy (monoclonal antibodies, vaccination strategy, exploration of dendritic cells etc.), gene therapy and innovations in stem cell transplantation (graft versus leukemia/lymphoma effect).

To better understand the function of PrPc, it is important to identify the different subcellular localization(s) of the protein and the different partners with which it might be associated. In this context, the PrPc-lectins interactions are investigated because PrPc is a sialoglycoprotein which can react with lectins which are carbohydrate-binding proteins. We have previously characterized a nuclear lectin CBP70 able to recognize N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosamine residues in HL60 cells. Using confocal immunofluorescence, flow-cytofluorometry, and Western-blotting, we have found that PrPc is expressed in the nucleus of the NB4 human promyelocytic leukemia cell line. It was also found that the lectin CBP70 is localized in NB4 cell nuclei. Moreover, several approaches revealed that PrPc and CBP70 are colocalized in the nucleus. Immunoprecipitation experiments showed that these proteins are coprecipitated and interact via a sugar-dependent binding moiety. In conclusion, PrPc and CBP70 are colocalized in the nuclear compartment of NB4 cells and this interaction may be important to better understand the biological function and possibly the conversion process of PrPc into its pathological form (PrPsc).","['Rybner, C', 'Finel-Szermanski, S', 'Felin, M', 'Sahraoui, T', 'Rousseau, C', 'Fournier, J G', 'Seve, A P', 'Botti, J']","['Rybner C', 'Finel-Szermanski S', 'Felin M', 'Sahraoui T', 'Rousseau C', 'Fournier JG', 'Seve AP', 'Botti J']","[""INSERM U-496, Institut Universitaire d'Hematologie (IUH), Hopital Saint-Louis, 1 Avenue Claude Vellefaux, 75475 Paris, Cedex 10, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,"['0 (Lectins)', '0 (PrPC Proteins)', '0 (carbohydrate-binding protein 70, human)']",IM,,"['Blotting, Western', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', 'Chromatography, Affinity', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Lectins/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'PrPC Proteins/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/01/12 10:00,2002/03/28 10:01,['2002/01/12 10:00'],"['2002/01/12 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/12 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2002;84(2):408-19. doi: 10.1002/jcb.10017.,,"['10.1002/jcb.10017 [pii]', '10.1002/jcb.10017 [doi]']",,,,"['Copyright 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,

The MRI showed a left temporal mass lesion. The patient was suffering from chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) for ten years, he had had surgery for prostate cancer eight years ago and the diagnosis of bronchial carcinoma was made during preoperative routine diagnostics. After neurosurgical intervention the histologic examination of the cerebral mass lesion disclosed metastasis of a PSA-negative adenocarcinoma with perivasal infiltrates of lymphocytic leukemic cells. - DISCUSSION: There are few reports about patients with three primary malignancies. CLL may play a role in enabling tumor cells to escape the immune response and could facilitate development of the prostate cancer and of a bronchial adenocarcinoma as secondary cancers in this patient. The combined occurrence of adenocarcinoma cells and CLL lymphocytes in the brain metastasis can be explained by impairment of the blood-brain-barrier in the carcinoma metastasis enabling extravasation of circulating leukemic cells.","['Nestler, U', 'Deinsberger, W', 'Grumbrecht, S', 'Kuchelmeister, K', 'Boker, D K']","['Nestler U', 'Deinsberger W', 'Grumbrecht S', 'Kuchelmeister K', 'Boker DK']","['Neurochirurgische Klinik, Justus-Liebig-Universitat, Giessen. ulf.nestler@neuro.med.uni-giessen.de']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Zentralbl Neurochir,Zentralblatt fur Neurochirurgie,0413646,,IM,,"['Adenocarcinoma/*pathology', 'Aged', 'Brain Neoplasms/diagnostic imaging/pathology/*secondary', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnostic imaging/*pathology', 'Lung Neoplasms/*diagnosis/diagnostic imaging/*pathology', 'Male', 'Neoplasms, Multiple Primary/*pathology', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/secondary/surgery', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed']",2002/01/12 10:00,2002/02/28 10:01,['2002/01/12 10:00'],"['2002/01/12 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/12 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Zentralbl Neurochir. 2001;62(2):57-61. doi: 10.1055/s-2002-19479.,,['10.1055/s-2002-19479 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Ninety children with JMML, various forms of MDS, or acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with antecedent MDS were treated with a five-drug induction regimen (standard or intensive timing). Patients achieving remission were allocated to allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) if a matched family donor was available. All other patients were randomized between autologous BMT and aggressive nonmyeloablative chemotherapy. Results were compared with patients with de novo AML. RESULTS: Patients with JMML and refractory anemia (RA) or RA-excess blasts (RAEB) exhibited high induction failure rates and overall remission of 58% and 48%, respectively. Remission rates for patients with RAEB in transformation (RAEB-T) (69%) or antecedent MDS (81%) were similar to de novo AML (77%). Actuarial survival rates at 6 years were as follows: JMML, 31% +/- 26%; RA and RAEB, 29% +/- 16%; RAEB-T, 30% +/- 18%; antecedent MDS, 50% +/- 25%; and de novo AML, 45% +/- 3%. For patients achieving remission, long-term survivors were found in those receiving either allogeneic BMT or chemotherapy. The presence of monosomy 7 had no additional adverse effect on MDS and JMML. CONCLUSION: Childhood subtypes of MDS and JMML represent distinct entities with distinct clinical outcomes. Children with a history of MDS who present with AML do well with AML-type therapy. Patients with RA or RAEB respond poorly to AML induction therapy. The optimum treatment for JMML remains unknown.","['Woods, William G', 'Barnard, Dorothy R', 'Alonzo, Todd A', 'Buckley, Jonathan D', 'Kobrinsky, Nathan', 'Arthur, Diane C', 'Sanders, Jean', 'Neudorf, Steven', 'Gold, Stuart', 'Lange, Beverly J']","['Woods WG', 'Barnard DR', 'Alonzo TA', 'Buckley JD', 'Kobrinsky N', 'Arthur DC', 'Sanders J', 'Neudorf S', 'Gold S', 'Lange BJ']","[""AFLAC Cancer Center, Emory University/Children's Healthcare, Atlanta, GA, USA. william.woods@choa.org""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2002/01/12 10:00,2002/03/20 10:01,['2002/01/12 10:00'],"['2002/01/12 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/20 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/12 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2002 Jan 15;20(2):434-40. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2002.20.2.434.,,['10.1200/JCO.2002.20.2.434 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Long-term survival after chemotherapy alone, second myeloablative transplant, or donor leukocyte infusions (DLIs) alone is unusual. DLIs may have minimal effectiveness in advanced disease because adequate cellular responses are not able to develop in the presence of bulky, fast-growing disease. A chemotherapy strategy was used to debulk disease before administration of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)-primed DLIs. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty-five patients experiencing hematologic relapse of myeloid malignancy after HLA-matched sibling BMT were prospectively treated with cytarabine-based chemotherapy, then G-CSF-primed DLIs. No prophylactic immunosuppression was provided. RESULTS: Twenty-seven of 57 assessable patients experienced a complete response. Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was observed in 56% of the patients. Treatment-related mortality was 23%. Overall survival at 2 years for the entire cohort was 19%. Patients with a complete response were more likely to survive, with 1- and 2-year survival rates of 51% and 41%, respectively, with a median follow-up of more than 2 years. The 1-year survival for nonresponders was 5%. A posttransplant remission lasting more than 6 months before relapse was associated with a higher likelihood of response. GVHD was not required for durable remission. CONCLUSION: Salvage treatment with chemotherapy before DLI can help some patients with advanced myeloid relapse and is not dependent on GVHD. Patients with short remissions after BMT are unlikely to benefit from this approach, and the approach is associated with significant treatment-related mortality. Modifications of this approach or entirely different approaches will be required for most patients with this difficult clinical problem.","['Levine, John E', 'Braun, Thomas', 'Penza, Samuel L', 'Beatty, Patrick', 'Cornetta, Kenneth', 'Martino, Rodrigo', 'Drobyski, William R', 'Barrett, A John', 'Porter, David L', 'Giralt, Sergio', 'Leis, Jose', 'Holmes, Houston E', 'Johnson, Matthew', 'Horowitz, Mary', 'Collins, Robert H Jr']","['Levine JE', 'Braun T', 'Penza SL', 'Beatty P', 'Cornetta K', 'Martino R', 'Drobyski WR', 'Barrett AJ', 'Porter DL', 'Giralt S', 'Leis J', 'Holmes HE', 'Johnson M', 'Horowitz M', 'Collins RH Jr']","['University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA. jelevine@umich.edu']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,['143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)'],IM,['J Clin Oncol. 2002 Jun 1;20(11):2756; author reply 2756-7.

Our main observations were as follows: 1/Stimulation of the cells with the bi-phosphorylated membrane proximal and central ITAMs (zeta (1)y(p)y(p) and zeta (2)y(p)y(p), respectively) resulted in a strong phosphorylation of proteins with a similar pattern. In contrast, the membrane distal ITAM, zeta (3)y(p)y(p) had a reduced ability to promote tyrosine phosphorylation and failed to induce the phosphorylation of a number of proteins. 2/ The phospho-peptide induced tyrosine phosphorylation events were at least partially mediated by p56(lck) and Syk/ZAP70 protein tyrosine kinases as it was shown in p56(lck) and Syk/ZAP70 deficient Jurkat variants. 3/The patterns of the association of the adaptor protein, Grb2 with tyrosine phosphorylated proteins following cell stimulation with the bi-phosphorylated membrane proximal or the central ITAMs were similar, while the membrane distal ITAM was unable to induce any of these associations. Our data provide additional evidence that the three zetaITAMs differ in their capacity to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of intracellular proteins in permeabilized T cells, depending to their primary sequence. The first and second ITAM sequences of the zeta chain may have similar but not totally overlapping functions. This conclusion results from their similar but not identical abilities to induce tyrosine phosphorylation and association of Grb-2 with intracellular phosphoproteins. In contrast, the third ITAM (zeta3) may have distinct functions since this peptide fails to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of a number of proteins compared to the other two ITAMs, and it is unable to induce either new association or the increase in the amount of Grb-2 associated phosphoproteins.","['Chitu, V', 'Fajka-Boja, R', 'Toth, G K', 'Varadi, G', 'Hegedus, Z', 'Franko, A', 'Szucs, K S', 'Monostori, E']","['Chitu V', 'Fajka-Boja R', 'Toth GK', 'Varadi G', 'Hegedus Z', 'Franko A', 'Szucs KS', 'Monostori E']","['Lymphocyte Signal Transduction Laboratory, Institute of Genetics, Biological Research Center, H-6726 Szeged, Temesvari krt. 62., Hungary']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Peptides,Peptides,8008690,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (GRB2 Adaptor Protein)', '0 (GRB2 protein, human)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP70 protein, human)']",IM,,"['*Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'GRB2 Adaptor Protein', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', 'Proteins/metabolism', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Tyrosine/metabolism', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase']",2002/01/12 10:00,2002/03/14 10:01,['2002/01/12 10:00'],"['2002/01/12 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/14 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/12 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Peptides. 2001 Dec;22(12):1963-71. doi: 10.1016/s0196-9781(01)00543-5.,,"['S0196978101005435 [pii]', '10.1016/s0196-9781(01)00543-5 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to amplify genomic pro-viral DNA of Avian Disease and Oncology Laboratory (ADOL)-Hc1 and ADOL-4817 envelope genes. Both open reading frames encoding glycoproteins gp85 and gp37 were cloned into baculoviruses. Abundant expression of gp85 and gp37 was detected in the recombinant viruses with specific antibody to Hc1 strain of the ALV-J. The expressed proteins were used for immunization of mice to produce hybridoma cell lines secreting MAbs specific to ALV-J envelope protein. A panel of MAbs was generated by fusing NS1 myeloma cells and spleen cells from mice immunized with the recombinant baculoviruses. With the use of an immunofluorescence assay, three MAbs (JE9, G2, 145) reacted with ALV-J but not with subgroups A, B, C, D, or E of ALV. MAb J47 reacted with all exogenous subgroups of ALV including A, B, C, D, and J but not with endogenous subgroup E viruses. Western blot analysis was performed with all four MAbs against recombinant baculovirus and Hc1-infected chicken embryo fibroblast (CEF) lysates. A major band with a molecular weight about 90 kD corresponding to the size of ALV-J envelope was consistently obtained. With these MAbs, we detected the Hc1 antigen in CEFs infected with several ALV-J viruses isolated in the United States and also in tissue sections from chickens infected with Hc1 strain of ALV-J. These MAbs will be useful reagents for the diagnosis of ALV-J infection because they recognize a common antigenic epitope in six isolates tested thus far.","['Qin, A', 'Lee, L F', 'Fadly, A', 'Hunt, H', 'Cui, Z']","['Qin A', 'Lee LF', 'Fadly A', 'Hunt H', 'Cui Z']","['USDA Agricultural Research Service, Avian Disease and Oncology Laboratory, East Lansing, MI 48823, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Avian Dis,Avian diseases,0370617,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/analysis/*immunology', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Avian Leukosis/*diagnosis/immunology', 'Avian Leukosis Virus/classification/*immunology', 'Blotting, Western/veterinary', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Chickens', 'DNA, Viral', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique, Indirect/veterinary', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/genetics/immunology', 'Molecular Weight', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods/veterinary', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/genetics/immunology']",2002/01/12 10:00,2002/09/11 10:01,['2002/01/12 10:00'],"['2002/01/12 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/11 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/12 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Avian Dis. 2001 Oct-Dec;45(4):938-45.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its production is greater in neutrophils and macrophages, which predominantly synthesize 1-alkyl sn-2 acetyl glycerophosphocholine (GPC) than in nongranulocytes (B cells and endothelial cells), which lack a respiratory burst and synthesize 1-acyl sn-2 acetyl GPC as their major PAF species. This study investigated whether the respiratory burst was responsible for the quantitative and qualitative differences in sn-2 acetyl GPC species generation by neutrophils and macrophages versus those cells lacking the NADPH oxidase complex. The myeloid cell line PLB-985 (capable of differentiation into neutrophils) was used to test this hypothesis, since these cells had previously been generated with a non-functional respiratory burst (X-CGD PLB-985). Differentiated PLB-985 cells underwent a large respiratory burst in response to PMA (phorbol ester), and smaller respiratory bursts in response to A23187 (calcium ionophore), and the bacterial polypeptide fMLP (receptor mediated activation). Concurrently, treated cells were assessed for production of 1-hexadecyl and 1-palmitoyl sn-2 acetyl GPC species by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Neither cell type generated these lipid species in response to PMA, but both cell types generated equal levels of sn-2 acetyl GPC in response to A23187, with five times more 1-hexadecyl than 1-palmitoyl species. Upon fMLP activation, X-CGD PLB-985 cells produced significantly less 1-hexadecyl and 1-palmitoyl sn-2 acetyl GPC in comparison to the wild-type PLB-985 cells. These findings suggest phagocytic oxidant production by NADPH oxidase is not essential for sn-2 acetyl GPC generation, but appears important for optimal production of PAF in response to some stimuli.","['Hiran, T', 'Dinauer, M', 'Johnson, C', 'Clay, K', 'Travers, J']","['Hiran T', 'Dinauer M', 'Johnson C', 'Clay K', 'Travers J']","['Herman B Wells Center for Pediatric Research, Department of Pediatrics (Hematology/Oncology), James Whitcomb Riley Hospital for Children, Indiana University Medical Center, Indianapolis 46202, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat,Prostaglandins & other lipid mediators,9808648,"['0 (Ionophores)', '0 (Phosphatidylcholines)', '0 (Platelet Activating Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Formyl Peptide)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Peptide)', '11062-77-4 (Superoxides)', '37H9VM9WZL (Calcimycin)', '42EWD89I80 (1-hexadecyl-2-acetyl-glycero-3-phosphocholine)', '59880-97-6 (N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine)', '60M22SGW66 (Glycerylphosphorylcholine)', '65929-03-5 (formylmethionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine methyl ester)', '84062-61-3 (1-palmitoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (NADPH Oxidases)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,,"['Calcimycin', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Glycerylphosphorylcholine/*analogs & derivatives/analysis/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Ionophores', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'NADPH Oxidases/*metabolism', 'Phosphatidylcholines', 'Platelet Activating Factor/*analogs & derivatives/analysis/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Formyl Peptide', 'Receptors, Immunologic/drug effects/metabolism', 'Receptors, Peptide/drug effects/metabolism', 'Superoxides/metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology']",2002/01/12 10:00,2002/06/28 10:01,['2002/01/12 10:00'],"['2002/01/12 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/06/28 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/12 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat. 2001 Dec;66(4):305-15. doi: 10.1016/s0090-6980(01)00163-0.,,"['S0090-6980(01)00163-0 [pii]', '10.1016/s0090-6980(01)00163-0 [doi]']",,,,,,"['HL34303/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL52565/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL62996/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'K08AR1993/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,

E2A encodes two products, E12 and E47, that are part of the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) family of transcription factors and are central in B lineage differentiation. E2A haplo-insufficiency hinders progression through three major checkpoints in B-cell development: commitment into the B lineage, at the pro-B to pre-B transition, and in the induction of immunoglobulin M (IgM) expression required for a functional BCR. These observations underscore the importance of E2A gene dosage in B-cell development. Here we show that a higher proportion of pro-B cells in E2A(+/-) mice is in the cell cycle compared to that in wild-type littermates. This increase correlates with lower p21(waf/cip1) levels, indicating that E2A has an antiproliferative function in B-cell progenitors. Ectopic expression in the B lineage of SCL/Tal1, a tissue-specific bHLH factor that inhibits E2A function, blocks commitment into the B lineage without affecting progression through later stages of differentiation. Furthermore, ectopic SCL expression exacerbates E2A haplo-insufficiency in B-cell differentiation, indicating that SCL genetically interacts with E2A. Taken together, these observations provide evidence for a gradient of E2A activity that increases from the pre-pro-B to the pre-B stage and suggest a model in which low levels of E2A (as in pro-B cells) are sufficient to control cell growth, while high levels (in pre-B cells) are required for cell differentiation. The antiproliferative function of E2A further suggests that in B-ALL associated with t(1;19) and t(17;19), the disruption of one E2A allele contributes to leukemogenesis, in addition to other anomalies induced by E2A fusion proteins.","['Herblot, Sabine', 'Aplan, Peter D', 'Hoang, Trang']","['Herblot S', 'Aplan PD', 'Hoang T']","['The Clinical Research Institute of Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (TCF3 protein, human)', '0 (Tal1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '135471-20-4 (TAL1 protein, human)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/*cytology/immunology/*metabolism', 'Base Sequence', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'DNA/genetics/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation', 'Gene Dosage', 'Helix-Loop-Helix Motifs', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/immunology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, Transgenic', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism']",2002/01/11 10:00,2002/02/12 10:01,['2002/01/11 10:00'],"['2002/01/11 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/12 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/11 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2002 Feb;22(3):886-900. doi: 10.1128/MCB.22.3.886-900.2002.,,['10.1128/MCB.22.3.886-900.2002 [doi]'],,,,,,,PMC133542,,,,,

We have disrupted the NSCL-1 gene by homologous recombination and replaced the coding region with a beta-galactosidase reporter cassette to study the role of NSCL-1 in neuronal development and to follow the fate of NSCL-1 mutant cells. NSCL-1 mutant mice are viable and fertile on various genetic backgrounds and do not show any obvious signs of neurological malfunction. No differences in the distribution of NSCL-1 mutant or heterozygous neuronal cells were observed in the diencephalon, hippocampus, neocortex, and cerebellum at different stages of development. Likewise, no defects were found in the laminar organization of the cortex, and the distinct neuronal subpopulation appeared normal during development of the neocortex. Analysis of sensory neurons which strongly express NSCL-1 revealed that the spatiotemporal expression of neuronal differentiation factors, such as NeuroD and SCG-10, was not altered in developing distal and proximal cranial ganglia of mutant mice. In the cerebellum expression of NSCL-1 was confined to the proliferative and premigratory zone of the external granular layer and the internal granular layer. Interestingly, unlike cerebella of Math1(-/-) or NeuroD2(-/-) mice, NSCL-1-deficient mice have no obvious developmental defect, and neurons of the cerebellum appeared fully differentiated. Despite similar expression patterns of NSCL-1 and NSCL-2 in various areas of the diencephalon, including the arcuate nucleus and paraventricular nucleus, NSCL-1(-/-) mice are fertile and show no adult onset of obesity like NSCL-2 mutant mice. Double-mutant NSCL-1(-/-)-NSCL-2(-/-) mice do not show any additional obvious malformations of the central nervous system, although both genes are expressed in a largely overlapping pattern.

However, the extent of this effect on other cell types has not been evaluated in vitro. In this study, we evaluated the effect of ECP on 13 mammalian cell lines. ECP inhibited the growth of several cell lines including those derived from carcinoma and leukemia in a dose-dependent manner. The IC(50) values on A431 cells, MDA-MB-453 cells, HL-60 cells and K562 cells were estimated to be approximately 1-5 microm. ECP significantly suppressed the size of colonies of A431 cells, and decreased K562 cells in G1/G0 phase. However, there was little evidence that ECP killed cells in either cell line. These effects of ECP were not enhanced by extending its N-terminus. Rhodamine B isothiocyanate-labeled ECP started to bind to A431 cells after 0.5 h and accumulated for up to 24 h, indicating that specific affinity for the cell surface may be important. The affinity of ECP for heparin was assessed and found to be reduced when tryptophan residues, one of which is located at a position in the catalytic subsite of ribonuclease in ECP, were modified. The growth-inhibitory effect was also attenuated by this modification.

These findings suggest that common antigen(s) might be recognized by T cells accumulating at sites of arthritis in both transgenic rats and mice.","['Sugaya, Toshiaki', 'Ishizu, Akihiro', 'Ikeda, Hitoshi', 'Nakamaru, Yuji', 'Fugo, Kazunori', 'Higuchi, Masato', 'Yamazaki, Hidetoshi', 'Imai, Kohzoh', 'Yoshiki, Takashi']","['Sugaya T', 'Ishizu A', 'Ikeda H', 'Nakamaru Y', 'Fugo K', 'Higuchi M', 'Yamazaki H', 'Imai K', 'Yoshiki T']","['Department of Pathology/Pathophysiology, Hokkaido University Graduate School of Medicine, Sapporo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Mol Pathol,Experimental and molecular pathology,0370711,"['0 (Collagen Type II)', '0 (Complementarity Determining Regions)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)']",IM,,"['Amino Acid Motifs', 'Animals', 'Animals, Genetically Modified', 'Arthritis, Experimental/chemically induced/genetics/*immunology', 'Arthritis, Rheumatoid/*immunology', 'Collagen Type II/immunology', 'Complementarity Determining Regions/chemistry/genetics', '*Genes, env', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Lew', 'Rats, Inbred Strains', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/metabolism']",2002/01/11 10:00,2002/03/08 10:01,['2002/01/11 10:00'],"['2002/01/11 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/08 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/11 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Mol Pathol. 2002 Feb;72(1):56-61. doi: 10.1006/exmp.2001.2415.,,"['10.1006/exmp.2001.2415 [doi]', 'S0014480001924153 [pii]']",,,,['Copyright 2002 Elsevier Science.'],,,,,,,,

This backdrop of mutant cells may be present in the majority of healthy individuals and is apparently weakly selected against. This may provide empirical support for the concept of global neutrality, or near-neutrality (very weak selection), of many somatic mutations. Many healthy individuals, as well as patients with chronic myeloid leukemia, manifest the BCR-ABL fusion gene in blood cells. The presumed neutrality of the BCR-ABL rearrangement-carrying pluripotential hematopoietic stem cells and the relative uniformity of the incidence rate of CML worldwide were used to estimate the extent of the background of BCR-ABL-positive stem cells and the numerical size of the human pluripotential hematopoietic stem cell pool. Three different approaches (molecular-epidemiological, statistical, and population genetical) were employed. Each resulted in very similar estimates of the size of the stem cells carrying the BCR-ABL allele fusions (1.4 x 10(4) cells) and the size of the total human stem cell pool (1.6 x 10(9) cells per individual). The implication of these estimates in the context of the hierarchical nature of the stem cell pool is also considered. The presumptive smaller-sized population of CD34(-) stem cells could not be characterized by any of the approaches used as a ""founding"" population, representing an ultimate source of all hematopoietic progenitors, or as a subset of stem cells comprising a deeper ""kinetic"" segment of the total (10(9)-sized) stem cell compartment.","['Jankovic, G M', 'Pavlovic, M', 'Vukomanovic, D J', 'Colovic, M D', 'Lazarevic, V']","['Jankovic GM', 'Pavlovic M', 'Vukomanovic DJ', 'Colovic MD', 'Lazarevic V']","['Institute of Hematology, University Clinical Center, Yugoslavia (Serbia). gradjank@eunet.yu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood Cells Mol Dis,"Blood cells, molecules & diseases",9509932,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,,"['Cell Survival', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/pathology', 'Clone Cells', 'Evolution, Molecular', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*etiology/genetics/pathology', '*Models, Genetic', 'Mutation', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*cytology/pathology', 'Poisson Distribution', 'Prevalence']",2002/01/11 10:00,2003/04/18 05:00,['2002/01/11 10:00'],"['2002/01/11 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/18 05:00 [medline]', '2002/01/11 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood Cells Mol Dis. 2001 Sep-Oct;27(5):913-7. doi: 10.1006/bcmd.2001.0462.,,"['10.1006/bcmd.2001.0462 [doi]', 'S1079-9796(01)90462-0 [pii]']",,,,['(c)2001 Elsevier Science.'],,,,,,,,

Earlier work indicated that this kinase is upregulated in a Burkitt's lymphoma cell line (GA-10). To determine whether PBK/TOPK is upregulated in other mitotically active neoplastic cell lines and tissues, Northern analysis was performed on a panel of malignant cell lines and on clinical samples from patients with leukemia or lymphoma. While PBK/TOPK mRNA was not detectable in normal peripheral blood cells and was weakly expressed in hyperplastic tonsillar B-cells, significantly higher levels of mRNA were detected in 8 Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines, 10 other neoplastic cell lines, and 2 clinical samples-one derived from a patient with ALL and a second derived from a patient with relapsed myeloma. In addition, Northern analysis of fetal tissues showed upregulated expression of PBK/TOPK in fetal kidney, lung, spleen, brain, and testis. These data suggest that PBK/TOPK expression is increased in highly proliferative malignant cells and during normal fetal development.","['Simons-Evelyn, M', 'Bailey-Dell, K', 'Toretsky, J A', 'Ross, D D', 'Fenton, R', 'Kalvakolanu, D', 'Rapoport, A P']","['Simons-Evelyn M', 'Bailey-Dell K', 'Toretsky JA', 'Ross DD', 'Fenton R', 'Kalvakolanu D', 'Rapoport AP']","['Greenebaum Cancer Center, University of Maryland, 22 South Greene Street, Baltimore, Maryland 21201, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood Cells Mol Dis,"Blood cells, molecules & diseases",9509932,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (PDZ-binding kinase)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'B-Lymphocytes/enzymology', 'Blood Cells/enzymology', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*enzymology/pathology', 'Fetus/cytology/enzymology', 'Humans', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases', 'Palatine Tonsil/cytology', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Up-Regulation']",2002/01/11 10:00,2003/04/18 05:00,['2002/01/11 10:00'],"['2002/01/11 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/18 05:00 [medline]', '2002/01/11 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood Cells Mol Dis. 2001 Sep-Oct;27(5):825-9. doi: 10.1006/bcmd.2001.0452.,,"['10.1006/bcmd.2001.0452 [doi]', 'S1079-9796(01)90452-8 [pii]']",,,,['(c)2001 Elsevier Science.'],,,,,,,,

METHODS: Using bone marrow culture of colony forming unite-acute myeloid leukemia (CFU-AML) method, the sensitivity of leukemic cells obtained from 18 patients to homoharringtonin (HHr), cytarabine (Ara), adriamycin (Adr) and etoposide (VP-16) were detected separately. RESULTS: TSPG alone (20 micrograms/ml) could stimulate proliferation of CFU-AML obviously, and increase the colony numbers by 37.98% over the non-TSPG control (P < 0.01). In the presence of TSPG, the inhibition rates of CFU-AML of HHr, Ara, Adr and VP-16 were 51.2%-62.0% respectively, which were significantly higher than 30.4%-47.4% of non-TSPG control (all P < 0.01). In the combination of TSPG with cytotoxic drugs, the leukemic progenitor cells became more sensitive to cytotoxic drugs, CFU-AML colony numbers at 1.84-2.23 fold as more as those of non-TSPG control were inhibited by HHr, Ara, Adr and VP-16. Sensitivity test of 17 among 72 drugs reversed from resistant (suppression rate less than 30%) to sensitive (suppression rate more than 30%) by TSPG. CONCLUSIONS: TSPG could drive non-cycling leukemic progenitors to enter cell cycle, and thereby enhance their susceptibility to cytotoxic drugs.","['Gao, R', 'Jin, J', 'Niu, Y']","['Gao R', 'Jin J', 'Niu Y']","['Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang College of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Hangzhou (310006).']",['chi'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Zhongguo Zhong Xi Yi Jie He Za Zhi,Zhongguo Zhong xi yi jie he za zhi Zhongguo Zhongxiyi jiehe zazhi = Chinese journal of integrated traditional and Western medicine,9211576,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Ginsenosides)', '0 (Harringtonines)', '0 (Saponins)', '6FG8041S5B (Homoharringtonine)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/pharmacology', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'Ginsenosides', 'Harringtonines/pharmacology', 'Homoharringtonine', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Panax', 'Saponins/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",2002/01/11 10:00,2002/05/01 10:01,['2002/01/11 10:00'],"['2002/01/11 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/05/01 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/11 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Zhongguo Zhong Xi Yi Jie He Za Zhi. 1999 Jan;19(1):17-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The effects of MCM were tested on a variety of cells by MTT assay. MCM was also tested following ultrafiltration, boiling at 100 degrees C and treatment with trypsin. Morphology and apoptosis of the MCM-treated cells were examined. RESULTS: Proliferation of mouse myeloma SP2/0, rat carcino-sarcoma Walker 256, and tumor cell lines of human origin, including leukemia K562 and HL-60, colon adenocarcinoma LS-174-T, prostatic carcinoma PC3-M, and lung adenocarcinoma with low(PLA801-C) and high(PLA801-D) metastatic potential were significantly decreased when cultured with MCM(P < 0.01-0.05) in a dose-dependent manner. The proliferation of normal cells(RGP-2 rabbit joint epiphysial disk cells) was not affected by MCM. Proliferation of the lung adenocarcinoma with high metastatic potential was more susceptible to the growth inhibitory effect of MCM as compared to that with low metastatic potential. On ultrafiltration, the inhibitory activity of MCM existed in the fraction with a molecular weight < or = 10,000. It was trypsin resistant but thermolabile. Apoptosis was not seen but the cytoplasmic membrane of tumor cells was destroyed after cultured in MCM. CONCLUSION: Rat skeletal muscle cells produce low molecular weight tumor suppressor(s) capable of selectively inhibiting tumor cell proliferation in vitro. Its activity is neither species- nor tumor-specific. The skeletal muscle derived tumor suppressor(s) may play a key role in the rarity of tumor metastases in skeletal muscles.","['Luo, C', 'Jiang, Y', 'Liu, Y']","['Luo C', 'Jiang Y', 'Liu Y']","['Department of General Surgery, PLA 301 Hospital, Beijing 100853, China.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",China,Zhonghua Zhong Liu Za Zhi,Zhonghua zhong liu za zhi [Chinese journal of oncology],7910681,"['0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Culture Media, Conditioned', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Molecular Weight', 'Muscle, Skeletal/*chemistry', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Rats', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*pharmacology']",2002/01/11 10:00,2002/02/23 10:01,['2002/01/11 10:00'],"['2002/01/11 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/23 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/11 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Zhonghua Zhong Liu Za Zhi. 2001 Jan;23(1):17-20.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study we have investigated effects of the cytokines interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta, interleukin-6 (IL-6), and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) on survival of and neurite growth from neonatal rat sensory neurons co-cultured with fibroblast-like cells prepared from neonatal rat skin (sFLCs) or perichondrium (pFLCs). The results showed that both FLC types expressed receptors for all three cytokines. Five ng/ml of either cytokine, but not lower or higher concentrations, supported survival of DRG neurons co-cultured with sFLCs. Neuronal survival was also enhanced by addition of the soluble IL-6 receptor (rsIL-6R) with or without IL-6. In co-cultures with pFLCs neuronal survival was promoted by IL-6, increasing with cytokine concentration. Addition of rsIL-6R without IL-6 did also stimulate neuronal survival. The growth of neurites from DRG neurons co-cultured with sFLCs was stimulated by 0.5 ng/ml LIF, unaffected by 5 ng/ml LIF and inhibited by 50 ng/ml LIF. Considering DRG neurons co-cultured with pFLCs, 50 ng/ml of either of the three cytokines, as well as rsIL-6R conditioned medium, stimulated neurite outgrowth.

Macrophages recruited to the OE after OBX are involved in both the degenerative and regenerative processes. Relative quantitative RT-PCR was used to demonstrate that within hours of OBX, mRNAs encoding three key components in the leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) signaling pathway, including LIF, LIF receptor (LIFR), and STAT3, as well as cyclin D1, a growth factor sensor indicative of progenitor cell transformation, were upregulated. These mRNAs reached peak levels of expression on or before day 3 post-OBX, coincident with the peak time for macrophage recruitment and progenitor cell proliferation. Cells expressing LIF mRNA in the OE of mice at 3 days post-OBX, the time point at which LIF mRNA expression peaked, were identified using non-isotopic in situ hybridization. LIF mRNA was localized in infiltrating macrophages; near-adjacent sections exhibited macrophages immunoreactive for F4/80, a marker for activated macrophages, in numbers commensurate with those expressing LIF mRNA. LIF mRNA was also localized in surviving ORNs, identified by their expression of olfactory marker protein (OMP) mRNA and protein in near-adjacent sections. Our data suggest that LIF functions as a mitogen originating from recruited macrophages through an intercellular signaling pathway that stimulates proliferation of progenitor cells leading to neurogenesis and regeneration, and as an intracellular survival factor for traumatized ORNs.","['Getchell, Thomas V', 'Shah, Dharmen S', 'Partin, James V', 'Subhedar, Nishikant K', 'Getchell, Marilyn L']","['Getchell TV', 'Shah DS', 'Partin JV', 'Subhedar NK', 'Getchell ML']","['Sanders-Brown Center on Aging, University of Kentucky College of Medicine, Lexington, Kentucky 40536-0230, USA. tgetche@pop.uky.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Neurosci Res,Journal of neuroscience research,7600111,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lifr protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (monocyte-macrophage differentiation antigen)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Differentiation/immunology/metabolism', 'Axotomy', 'Cell Movement/physiology', 'Cyclin D1/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation/physiology', 'Growth Inhibitors/*genetics', 'Immunohistochemistry', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit', 'Lymphokines/*genetics', 'Macrophages/cytology/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Nerve Regeneration/*genetics', 'Olfactory Bulb/injuries/surgery', 'Olfactory Mucosa/cytology/metabolism', 'Olfactory Receptor Neurons/cytology/*metabolism', 'Phenotype', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Receptors, Cytokine/genetics', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF', 'Retrograde Degeneration/*metabolism/physiopathology', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'Signal Transduction/genetics', 'Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Trans-Activators/genetics', 'Up-Regulation/*genetics']",2002/01/10 10:00,2002/02/22 10:01,['2002/01/10 10:00'],"['2002/01/10 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/22 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/10 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Neurosci Res. 2002 Jan 15;67(2):246-54. doi: 10.1002/jnr.10090.,,"['10.1002/jnr.10090 [pii]', '10.1002/jnr.10090 [doi]']",,,,"['Copyright 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,['R01 AG-16824-20/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,

Pluronic P-105 molecules were labeled with a pH-sensitive fluorescent label, 5-(and 6-)carboxy-2'7'-dichlorofluorescein. The fluorescence intensity of labeled Pluronic was about twofold higher at pH 7.4 than at pH 5.5. At Pluronic concentrations exceeding the critical micelle concentration (cmc), flow cytometry histograms manifested bimodal distribution of cell fluorescence for all types of cells. Cell population characterized by higher fluorescence intensity presumably resulted from Pluronic transfer from the acidic environment of cytoplasmic vesicles (endosomes or lysosomes) into the neutral environment of the cytoplasm and cell nuclei, which suggested the permeabilization of the membranes of acidic vesicle by Pluronic molecules. For the MDR cells, the bimodal distribution of cell fluorescence was already observed at very low Pluronic concentrations in the incubation medium (i.e., below the cmc). The data suggest that the membranes of acidic vesicles of MDR cells are more susceptible to the action of polymeric surfactants than those of drug-sensitive cells. Permeabilization of acidic vesicles had a dramatic effect on the intracellular trafficking of drugs: when delivered in PBS, the anthracyclin drug ruboxyl (Rb) sequestered in cytoplasmic vesicles and was excluded from cell nuclei; however, when delivered in Pluronic micelles, drug accumulated in cell nuclei. Drug uptake from/with Pluronic micelles was substantially enhanced by ultrasound. These findings suggest that the nuclear accumulation of drugs internalized via fluid-phase endocytosis can be enhanced by the application of Pluronic micelles and can be further augmented by ultrasonic irradiation.","['Rapoport, Natalya', 'Marin, Alexander', 'Luo, Yi', 'Prestwich, Glenn D', 'Muniruzzaman, M D']","['Rapoport N', 'Marin A', 'Luo Y', 'Prestwich GD', 'Muniruzzaman MD']","['Department of Bioengineering, University of Utah, 20 S. 2030 E., Room 108, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA. natasha.rapoport@m.cc.utah.edu']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Pharm Sci,Journal of pharmaceutical sciences,2985195R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Excipients)', '0 (Micelles)', '106392-12-5 (Poloxamer)']",IM,,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacokinetics', 'Drug Delivery Systems/*methods', 'Drug Resistance/physiology', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/*physiology', 'Excipients/pharmacokinetics', 'Female', 'HL-60 Cells/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Fluid/*metabolism', '*Micelles', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/metabolism', 'Poloxamer/*pharmacokinetics', 'Protein Transport/physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/metabolism', 'Ultrasonics']",2002/01/10 10:00,2002/03/21 10:01,['2002/01/10 10:00'],"['2002/01/10 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/21 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/10 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Pharm Sci. 2002 Jan;91(1):157-70. doi: 10.1002/jps.10006.,,"['S0022-3549(16)30888-7 [pii]', '10.1002/jps.10006 [doi]']",,,,"['Copyright 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,['R01 CA76562-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,

To establish the long-term pathological consequences of loss of SOCS-1 in mice, where initial survival was made possible by also deleting the IFN-gamma gene, a comparison was made of the lifespan of groups of SOCS-1(-/-) IFN-gamma(-/-), SOCS-1(+/+) IFN-gamma(-/-) and SOCS-1(+/+) IFN-gamma(+/+) mice. Mice lacking the genes for both SOCS-1 and IFN-gamma exhibited an accelerated death rate compared with control groups. Disease states developing selectively in SOCS-1(-/-) IFN-gamma(-/-) mice were polycystic kidneys, pneumonia, chronic skin ulcers, and chronic granulomas in the gut and various other organs. Mice of all three groups developed cataracts, but disease development was accelerated in the groups lacking IFN-gamma. SOCS-1(-/-) IFN-gamma(-/-) mice exhibited a slightly increased predisposition to the development of T lymphoid leukemia, either spontaneous or radiation-induced. The development of polycystic kidneys may be caused by a developmental defect in renal-tubule organization noted in neonatal SOCS-1(-/-) mice. The chronic infections and granulomas of SOCS-1(-/-) IFN-gamma(-/-) mice may be based on autoaggression of SOCS-1(-/-) T lymphoid and related cells or a functional deficiency of these cells when lacking SOCS-1.","['Metcalf, Donald', 'Mifsud, Sandra', 'Di Rago, Ladina', 'Nicola, Nicos A', 'Hilton, Douglas J', 'Alexander, Warren S']","['Metcalf D', 'Mifsud S', 'Di Rago L', 'Nicola NA', 'Hilton DJ', 'Alexander WS']","['The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, and the Cooperative Research Centre for Cellular Growth Factors, Post Office Royal Melbourne Hospital, Victoria 3050, Australia. metcalf@wehi.edu.au']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Socs1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 1 Protein)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Carrier Proteins/*genetics/physiology', 'Fatty Liver/genetics/pathology', 'Female', 'Inflammation/*genetics/pathology', 'Interferon-gamma/deficiency/genetics/physiology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/genetics', 'Longevity/genetics', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Phenotype', 'Polycystic Kidney Diseases/*genetics/pathology', '*Repressor Proteins', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 1 Protein', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins']",2002/01/10 10:00,2002/05/01 10:01,['2002/01/10 10:00'],"['2002/01/10 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/05/01 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/10 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2002 Jan 22;99(2):943-8. doi: 10.1073/pnas.022628499.

Among about 40 kinds of cells, Burkitt lymphoma cells showed the highest gene expression concomitant with the expression levels of Gb3/CD77. Unexpectedly, megakaryoblastic leukemia lines also expressed fairly high levels of mRNA of Gb3/CD77 synthase and its product. A megakaryoblastic leukemia line, MEG-01 was sensitive to verotoxins from Escherichia coli O157 and apoptosis was induced via the caspase pathway. We also demonstrated that the cell surface Gb3/CD77 expression was reduced on differentiated MEG-01 although the mRNA level of the alpha1,4Gal-T gene increased. In this case, the localization of Gb3/CD77 was changed from the cell surface to the cytoplasm as stained with a granular pattern, co-localizing with platelet GPIIb-IIIa, indicating that some of them were platelet precursors. Small particles outside of cells also showed similar staining patterns. These results agreed with the previous report that platelets produced in mature megakaryoblasts abundantly contained Gb3/CD77 antigen. Here, we propose the possibility that verotoxins bind immature megakaryoblasts and induce their apoptosis, leading to the arrest of platelet generation in the bone marrow.

In this study, we identify a novel p53-interacting region in CBP/p300, which we call CR2, located near the carboxyl terminus. The 95-amino acid CR2 region (amino acids 2055--2150) is located adjacent to the C/H3 domain and corresponds precisely with the minimal steroid receptor coactivator 1 (SRC1)-interacting domain of CBP (also called IBiD). We show that the region of p53 that participates in the CR2 interaction resides within the first 107 amino acids of the protein. p53 binds strongly to the CR2 domain of both CBP and the highly homologous coactivator p300. Importantly, an in-frame deletion of CR2 within the full-length p300 protein strongly compromises p300-mediated p53 transcriptional activation from a chromatin template in vitro. The identification of the p53-interacting CR2 domain in CBP/p300 prompted us to ask if the human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV-I) Tax protein, which also interacts with CR2, competes with p53 for binding to this domain. We show that p53 and Tax exhibit mutually exclusive binding to the CR2 region, possibly contributing to the previously reported Tax repression of p53 function. Together, these studies identify and molecularly characterize a new p53 binding site on CBP/p300 that participates in coactivator-mediated p53 transcription function.

This work examined posttransplant relapse of the DBA/2 P815 mastocytoma in a murine model of MHC-matched, minor histocompatibility antigen (mHAg)-mismatched bone marrow transplantation (BALB/c donors into DBA/2 recipients). Antihost alloreactivity was associated with reduction of posttransplant tumor burden and prolongation of survival, but posttransplant relapse commonly occurred. No evidence of acquired resistance to immune control was found in 12 relapse reisolates. Relapse tumors remained sensitive to donor antihost CTLs in vitro, suggesting continued expression of mHAgs. Reisolates also continued to express Fas. However, loss of posttransplant alloreactivity was observed at 3 weeks. This was temporally associated with the time of relapse. Antihost alloreactivity could be reactivated in stable graft-versus-host disease-free recipients by immunization with host cells.

Exposure of K562 cells to concentrations of STI571 that minimally induced apoptosis (e.g., approximately 200 nM) resulted in early suppression (i.e., at 6 h) of p42/44 MAPK phosphorylation followed at later intervals (i.e., > or =24 h) by a marked increase in p42/44 MAPK phosphorylation/activation. Coadministration of a nontoxic concentration of the MEK1/2 inhibitor PD184352 (5 microM) prevented STI571-mediated activation of p42/44 MAPK. Cells exposed to STI571 in combination with PD184352 for 48 h demonstrated a very dramatic increase in mitochondrial dysfunction (e.g., loss of DeltaPsim and cytosolic cytochrome c release) associated with procaspase-3 activation, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage, and the appearance of the characteristic morphological features of apoptosis. Similar results were obtained using other pharmacological MEK1/2 inhibitors (e.g., PD 98059 and U0126) as well as another leukemic cell line that expresses Bcr-Abl (e.g., LAMA 84). However, synergistic induction of apoptosis by STI571 and PD184352 was not observed in human myeloid leukemia cells that do not express the Bcr-Abl kinase (e.g., HL-60 and U937) nor in normal human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Synergistic potentiation of STI571-mediated lethality by PD184352 was associated with multiple perturbations in signaling and apoptotic regulatory pathways, including caspase-dependent down-regulation of Bcr-Abl and Bcl-2; caspase-independent down-regulation of Bcl-x(L) and Mcl-1; activation of JNK, p38 MAPK, and p34(cdc2); and diminished phosphorylation of Stat5 and CREB. Significantly, coexposure to PD184352 strikingly increased the lethality of a pharmacologically achievable concentration of STI571 (i.e., 1-2 microM) in resistant K562 cells expressing marked increases in Bcr-Abl protein levels. Together, these findings raise the possibility that treatment of Bcr-Abl-expressing cells with STI571 elicits a cytoprotective MAPK activation response and that interruption of the latter pathway (e.g., by pharmacological MEK1/2 inhibitors) is associated with a highly synergistic induction of mitochondrial damage and apoptosis. They also indicate that in the case of Bcr-Abl-positive cells, simultaneous interruption of two signal transduction pathways may represent an effective antileukemic strategy.","['Yu, Chunrong', 'Krystal, Geoffrey', 'Varticovksi, Lyuba', 'McKinstry, Robert', 'Rahmani, Mohamed', 'Dent, Paul', 'Grant, Steven']","['Yu C', 'Krystal G', 'Varticovksi L', 'McKinstry R', 'Rahmani M', 'Dent P', 'Grant S']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Medical College of Virginia, Richmond, Virginia 23298, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (2-(2-chloro-4-iodophenylamino)-N-cyclopropylmethoxy-3,4-difluorobenzamide)', '0 (Activating Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Milk Proteins)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (MAP2K2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDC2 Protein Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (MAP Kinase Kinase Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP2K1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases)']",IM,,"['Activating Transcription Factor 1', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Benzamides/*pharmacology', 'CDC2 Protein Kinase/metabolism', 'Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*biosynthesis', 'G1 Phase/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells/drug effects/enzymology/pathology', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases', 'K562 Cells/drug effects/enzymology/pathology', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 1', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 2', 'MAP Kinase Kinase Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/*drug effects/physiology', '*Milk Proteins', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism/physiology', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Resting Phase, Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors', 'U937 Cells/drug effects/enzymology/pathology']",2002/01/10 10:00,2002/02/13 10:01,['2002/01/10 10:00'],"['2002/01/10 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/13 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/10 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2002 Jan 1;62(1):188-99.,,,,,,,,"['CA 83705/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA63753/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,

The HOXD11 gene is one of the HOXD cluster genes and contains 2 exons, encoding a protein of 338 amino acids with a homeodomain. Reverse transcription (RT)-PCR analysis showed that two alternatively spliced 5'-NUP98 transcripts were fused in frame to the HOXD11 gene. Both proteins consist of an NH(2)-terminal phenylalanine-glycine repeat motif of NUP98 and COOH-terminal homeodomain of HOXD11. RT-PCR analysis in various leukemic cell lines showed that expression of the HOXD11 gene was significantly more frequent in BCR-ABL-positive than in BCR-ABL-negative leukemic cell lines (P = 0.028). Our results revealed that t(2;11)(q31;p15) was not a single chromosomal abnormality and that the NUP98-HOXD fusion genes encode similar fusion proteins, which suggests that the NUP98-HOXD11 as well as NUP98-HOXD13 fusion protein play a role in leukemogenesis through similar mechanisms.","['Taketani, Takeshi', 'Taki, Tomohiko', 'Shibuya, Noriko', 'Ito, Etsuro', 'Kitazawa, Junichi', 'Terui, Kiminori', 'Hayashi, Yasuhide']","['Taketani T', 'Taki T', 'Shibuya N', 'Ito E', 'Kitazawa J', 'Terui K', 'Hayashi Y']","['Department of Pediatrics, Graduate School of Medicine, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, 113-8655, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (HOXD11 protein, human)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (nuclear pore complex protein 98)']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Artificial Gene Fusion', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Southern', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 2', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Homeodomain Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transcription Factors/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic/*genetics']",2002/01/10 10:00,2002/02/13 10:01,['2002/01/10 10:00'],"['2002/01/10 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/13 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/10 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2002 Jan 1;62(1):33-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Implicitly, these methods emphasize covariate effects on failure times rather than their effects on the proportion of long-term survivors ('cures'), which may be of equal or primary interest. In paediatric cancer, treatment has progressed dramatically in recent decades, and in many diagnoses cures are obtained in a large fraction of patients. A primary focus of clinical research is therefore the achievement of cure. Parametric cure model (PCM) analysis, introduced 50 years ago, is arguably better suited to the analytic requirements of clinical research in paediatric and other cancers where cure is achieved. In this paper two classes of PCMs are described and used to analyse examples from the Children's Cancer Group. These are compared to analyses using Cox regression analysis. Results from PCM analyses are similar or identical to Cox regression analysis when the PH assumption is appropriate. When it is not, PCMs can provide a coherent way to investigate and report covariate effects on the proportion cured separately from their effect on time to failure. Despite their reliance on explicit parametric forms, PCMs often provide a good description of cancer outcome, and are insensitive to lack of fit provided that follow-up is sufficient.","['Sposto, Richard']",['Sposto R'],"[""Children's Oncology Group and USC/Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA. rsposto@nccf.org""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Stat Med,Statistics in medicine,8215016,,IM,,"['Child', 'Data Interpretation, Statistical', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Hodgkin Disease/drug therapy/mortality', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/drug therapy/mortality', '*Models, Statistical', 'Neoplasms/mortality/*therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/mortality', 'Proportional Hazards Models', '*Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",2002/01/10 10:00,2002/03/15 10:01,['2002/01/10 10:00'],"['2002/01/10 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/15 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/10 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Stat Med. 2002 Jan 30;21(2):293-312. doi: 10.1002/sim.987.,,"['10.1002/sim.987 [pii]', '10.1002/sim.987 [doi]']",,,,"['Copyright 2002 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']",,['CA 13539/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,

The longitudinal data are irregularly collected and the event times are subject to right censoring. Most methods described in the literature are quite complex and do not belong to the standard statistical tools. We propose a more practical approach using Cox regression with time-dependent covariates. Since the longitudinal data are observed irregularly, we have to account for differences in observation frequency between individual patients. Therefore, the time elapsed since last observation (TEL) is added to the model. TEL and its interaction with the time-dependent covariate show a strong effect on the hazard. The latter indicates that older recordings have less impact than recent recordings. Pros and cons of this methodology are discussed and a simulation study is performed to study the effect of TEL on the hazard. The fitted Cox model serves as a starting point for the prediction of future patient's events. Our method is applied to a study on chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) with longitudinal white blood cell counts (WBC) as time-dependent covariate and patient's death as event.","['de Bruijne, M H', 'le Cessie, S', 'Kluin-Nelemans, H C', 'van Houwelingen, H C']","['de Bruijne MH', 'le Cessie S', 'Kluin-Nelemans HC', 'van Houwelingen HC']","['Department of Medical Statistics, Leiden University Medical Center, P.O. 9604, Leiden, 2300 RC, The Netherlands.

Besides frailty modelling, two simple trends of modelling have been developed: the first one uses stratification on the rank of the event, whereas the second one, more closely related to Poisson processes theory, does not use stratification. Although they both take into account the correlation of the unit failure times, each of these approaches emphasizes a different aspect of the underlying point process and there is still an ongoing debate concerning the most appropriate method. The aim of this paper is to stress current interests and trends concerning these two approaches. For each model, main statistical methods for estimating the covariates effects are presented. Methods are illustrated and compared in two randomized clinical trials which involve recurrences of severe adverse events following chemotherapy in 938 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, and recurrences of infectious rhinitis episodes in 327 patients.

When folic acid intake is sufficient, homozygotes for MTHFR 677T appear to be protected against colon cancer and acute lymphatic leukemia, and fetuses bearing this genotype have an augmented survival. The distribution of MTHFR 677T is worldwide, but its frequency in different populations varies extensively. In the present study, we addressed the question of whether the MTHFR 677T alteration has an ancestral origin or has occurred repeatedly. We analyzed the frequency distribution of the previously described polymorphism A1298C in exon 7 and of three intronic dimorphisms, in white Israelis (Jews and Arabs), Japanese, and Ghanaian Africans. The 677T allele was, remarkably, associated with one haplotype, G-T-A-C, in white and Japanese homozygotes. Among the Africans, analysis of maximum likelihood also disclosed an association with the G-T-A-C haplotype, although none of the 174 subjects examined was homozygous for MTHFR 677T.

Without effective treatment, individuals in the indolent, chronic phase (CP) of CML undergo blast crisis (BC), the prognosis for which is poor. It is therefore important to clarify the mechanism underlying stage progression in CML. DNA microarray is a versatile tool for such a purpose. However, simple comparison of bone marrow mononuclear cells from individuals at different disease stages is likely to result in the identification of pseudo-positive genes whose change in expression only reflects the different proportions of leukemic blasts in bone marrow. We have therefore compared with DNA microarray the expression profiles of 3456 genes in the purified HSC-like fractions that had been isolated from 13 CML patients and healthy volunteers. Interestingly, expression of the gene for PIASy, a potential inhibitor of STAT (signal transducer and activator of transcription) proteins, was down-regulated in association with stage progression in CML. Furthermore, forced expression of PIASy has induced apoptosis in a CML cell line. These data suggest that microarray analysis with background-matched samples is an efficient approach to identify molecular events underlying the stage progression in CML.","['Ohmine, K', 'Ota, J', 'Ueda, M', 'Ueno, S', 'Yoshida, K', 'Yamashita, Y', 'Kirito, K', 'Imagawa, S', 'Nakamura, Y', 'Saito, K', 'Akutsu, M', 'Mitani, K', 'Kano, Y', 'Komatsu, N', 'Ozawa, K', 'Mano, H']","['Ohmine K', 'Ota J', 'Ueda M', 'Ueno S', 'Yoshida K', 'Yamashita Y', 'Kirito K', 'Imagawa S', 'Nakamura Y', 'Saito K', 'Akutsu M', 'Mitani K', 'Kano Y', 'Komatsu N', 'Ozawa K', 'Mano H']","['Division of Functional Genomics, Jichi Medical School, Kawachi-gun, Tochigi 329-0498, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (AC133 Antigen)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (PIAS4 protein, human)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Poly-ADP-Ribose Binding Proteins)', '0 (Protein Inhibitors of Activated STAT)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,,"['AC133 Antigen', 'Antigens, CD', 'Apoptosis', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics/physiology', 'Disease Progression', 'Down-Regulation', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*methods', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Glycoproteins/analysis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Humans', '*Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis/*genetics/pathology', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/*methods', 'Peptides/analysis', 'Poly-ADP-Ribose Binding Proteins', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Inhibitors of Activated STAT', 'RNA, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Up-Regulation']",2002/01/10 10:00,2002/01/24 10:01,['2002/01/10 10:00'],"['2001/06/18 00:00 [received]', '2001/09/28 00:00 [revised]', '2001/10/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/01/10 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/24 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/10 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2001 Dec 13;20(57):8249-57. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1205029.,,['10.1038/sj.onc.1205029 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The human chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is a model for multi-step leukemogenesis. BCR-ABL, a constitutively active tyrosine kinase, is a fusion protein generated by the t(9;22)(q34;q11) translocation found in the vast majority of CML patients. BCR-ABL efficiently induces a myeloproliferative disorder (MPD) in mice, but progression to CML blast phase requires additional mutations. The AML1/MDS1/EVI1 (AME) transcription factor fusion protein, is a product of the human t(3;21)(q26;q22) translocation found as a secondary mutation in some cases of CML during the blast phase. We have previously shown that AME can induce an AML in mice but with a greatly extended latency, suggesting a requirement for additional mutations. Here we demonstrate that AME alone does not block myeloid differentiation in vivo during the 4-month pre-leukemia stage, yet co-expression of BCR-ABL and AME in mice can block myeloid differentiation and rapidly induce an AML. Our results suggest that block of myeloid differentiation and induction of AML involves cooperation between mutations that dysregulate protein tyrosine kinase signaling and those that disrupt hematopoietic gene transcription.","['Cuenco, G M', 'Ren, R']","['Cuenco GM', 'Ren R']","['Rosenstiel Basic Medical Sciences Research Center, Department of Biology, Brandeis University, Waltham, MA 02454, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '0 (MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein)', '0 (MECOM protein, human)', '0 (Mecom protein, mouse)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Runx1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology/physiology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/physiology', 'Disease Progression', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/*physiology', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*etiology/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemic Infiltration', 'Luminescent Proteins/genetics', 'MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Myeloid Cells/*cytology', '*Neoplasm Proteins', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/*physiology', 'Proteins/genetics/physiology', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/physiology', 'Transduction, Genetic']",2002/01/10 10:00,2002/01/24 10:01,['2002/01/10 10:00'],"['2001/08/21 00:00 [received]', '2001/10/10 00:00 [revised]', '2001/10/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/01/10 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/24 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/10 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2001 Dec 13;20(57):8236-48. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1205095.,,['10.1038/sj.onc.1205095 [doi]'],,,,,,['GM07122/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,

The HSV isolate was resistant to acyclovir (IC(50) = 105 microM), and a nucleotide (G) was added to the thymidine kinase gene leading to a premature stop codon. The lesion improved markedly with foscarnet. During this treatment a second HSV infection occurred on the buttocks 2 weeks after the first one and healed completely with acyclovir. This course correlated with in vitro results of the buttock HSV isolate which was foscarnet-resistant (IC(50) = 300 microg/ml) and acyclovir-sensitive. Surprisingly, no mutation gene of the foscarnet-resistant isolate was detected in the DNA polymerase gene.

Between August 1993 and January 1999, 17 patients, median age 26 (4-44) years, underwent T cell depleted bone marrow transplant from partially mismatched related donors (PMRD), as a salvage for AML relapsing after an autograft. The median time from auto-transplant to relapse was 7 months (1.5-24) and the interval between transplants was 10 months (3-30). All patients had active leukemia at time of transplant. Donors were siblings (n = 8), parents (n = 2), daughters (n = 4) and others (n = 3), and 82% were > or = 2 major HLA antigen mismatched with the recipient. The conditioning therapy included total body irradiation in 14 patients and was busulfan-based in three. Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis consisted of partial T cell depletion along with post-transplant immunosuppression. Median day to engraftment was 16 days (12-20). Acute GVHD was seen in six patients, and chronic GVHD in four of 13 surviving beyond 100 days. Ten patients died of non-relapse causes, at 1-588 (median 77) days. Two patients relapsed at 3 and 4 months. Five patients (29%) are surviving leukemia-free 42-84 months post transplant (median 68 months). A short interval between transplants was predictive of early relapse but not mortality. Age <18 and <2 organ toxicities were marginally predictive of better survival.

To investigate whether a functional link exists between PECAM-1 activation and gelatinase B production, the regulatory role of PECAM-1, IFN-gamma, IFN-beta, LPS, and PMA on the production of gelatinase B (MMP-9) was studied in vitro in normal human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and in a human monocytic leukemia cell line. In THP-1 cells, progelatinase B levels were slightly up-regulated by immobilized PECAM-1-specific monoclonal antibody (mAb) and soluble recombinant PECAM-1 when compared with strong induction by LPS and PMA. IFN-beta inhibited the induced and basal gelatinase B production but had no modulating effect on the expression of PECAM-1. HUVECs mainly produced progelatinase A (proMMP-2). Treatment with LPS and triggering of the endothelial cells with PECAM-1 mAb or recombinant PECAM-1 had no effect on gelatinase A or B production, whereas PMA stimulated the production of progelatinase B. IFN-beta significantly up-regulated the expression of PECAM-1 in HUVECs but did not affect gelatinase secretion. Finally, in PBMCs, progelatinase B production was increased by soluble PECAM-1 mAb, recombinant PECAM-1, LPS, and PMA, whereas IFN-beta reduced gelatinase B secretion. IFN-beta did not alter PECAM-1 expression on PBMCs. Thus, PECAM-1 and gelatinase B are differently regulated in leukocytes and endothelial cells.","['Nelissen, Inge', 'Ronsse, Isabelle', 'Van Damme, Jo', 'Opdenakker, Ghislain']","['Nelissen I', 'Ronsse I', 'Van Damme J', 'Opdenakker G']","['Rega Institute for Medical Research, Laboratory of Molecular Immunology, University of Leuven, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,"['0 (Immunologic Factors)', '0 (Platelet Endothelial Cell Adhesion Molecule-1)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '77238-31-4 (Interferon-beta)', 'EC 3.4.24.35 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 9)']",IM,,"['Cells, Cultured', 'Endothelium, Vascular/*enzymology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Factors/*pharmacology', 'Interferon-beta/*pharmacology', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 9/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Monocytes/*enzymology', 'Organ Specificity', 'Platelet Endothelial Cell Adhesion Molecule-1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Up-Regulation']",2002/01/10 10:00,2002/01/31 10:01,['2002/01/10 10:00'],"['2002/01/10 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/31 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/10 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 2002 Jan;71(1):89-98.,,,,,,,,['651/Multiple Sclerosis Society/United Kingdom'],,,,,,

In many cases, illegitimate V(D)J recombination has been proposed to be involved in the translocation process, but this has never been functionally established. Using extra-chromosomal recombination assays, we determined the ability of several proto-oncogenes to target V(D)J recombination, and assessed the impact of their recombinogenic potential on translocation rates in vivo. Our data support the involvement of 2 distinct mechanisms: translocations involving LMO2, TAL2, and TAL1 in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), are compatible with illegitimate V(D)J recombination between a TCR locus and a proto-oncogene locus bearing a fortuitous but functional recombination site (type 1); in contrast, translocations involving BCL1 and BCL2 in B cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (B-NHL), are compatible with a process in which only the IgH locus breaks are mediated by V(D)J recombination (type 2). Most importantly, we show that the t(11;14)(p13;q32) translocation involving LMO2 is present at strikingly high frequency in normal human thymus, and that the recombinogenic potential conferred by the LMO2 cryptic site is directly predictive of the in vivo level of translocation at that locus.

They also cause waterborne disease in both the United States and United Kingdom. Studies on the mechanisms of immunity to cryptosporidiosis indicate the importance of the T-cell response. The spectrum and severity of disease in immunocompromised individuals with cryptosporidiosis reflect this importance since the most severe disease is seen in individuals with defects in the T-cell response. The most commonly studied group is that of patients with AIDS. These patients suffer from more severe and prolonged gastrointestinal disease that can be fatal; in addition, body systems other than the gastrointestinal tract may be affected. The widespread use of antiretroviral therapy does appear to be having a beneficial effect on recovery from cryptosporidiosis and on the frequency of infection in human immunodeficiency virus-positive patients. Other diseases that are associated with increased risk of severe cryptosporidiosis, such as primary immunodeficiencies, most notably severe combined immunodeficiency syndrome, are also predominantly associated with T-cell defects.

The current study compared the effects of these agents on the survival of K562 cells, bcr/abl-transduced FDC-P1 cells, and myeloid progenitors from patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) compared with healthy donors. Treatment of K562 cells with 10 microM adaphostin resulted in decreased p210(bcr/abl) polypeptide levels in the first 6 hours, followed by caspase activation and accumulation of apoptotic cells in less than 12 hours. By 24 hours, 90% of the cells were apoptotic and unable to form colonies. In contrast, 20 microM STI571 caused rapid inhibition of bcr/abl autophosphorylation without p210(bcr/abl) degradation. Although this was followed by the inhibition of Stat5 phosphorylation and the down-regulation of Bcl-x(L) and Mcl-1, only 7% +/- 3% and 25% +/- 9% of cells were apoptotic at 16 and 24 hours, respectively. Instead, the cytotoxic effects of STI571 became more pronounced with prolonged exposure, with IC90 values greater than 20 microM and 1.0 +/- 0.6 microM after 24 and 48 hours, respectively. Consistent with these results, 24-hour adaphostin exposure inhibited CML granulocyte colony-forming units (CFU-G) (median IC50, 12 microM) but not normal CFU-G (median IC50, greater than 20 microM), whereas 24-hour STI571 treatment had no effect on CML or normal CFU-G. Additional experiments revealed that STI571-resistant K562 cells remained sensitive to adaphostin. Moreover, the combination of STI571 + adaphostin induced more cytotoxicity in K562 cells and in CML CFU-G than either agent alone did. Collectively, these results identify adaphostin as a mechanistically distinct CML-selective agent that retains activity in STI571-resistant cell lines.","['Mow, Benjamin M F', 'Chandra, Joya', 'Svingen, Phyllis A', 'Hallgren, Christopher G', 'Weisberg, Ellen', 'Kottke, Timothy J', 'Narayanan, Ven L', 'Litzow, Mark R', 'Griffin, James D', 'Sausville, Edward A', 'Tefferi, Ayalew', 'Kaufmann, Scott H']","['Mow BM', 'Chandra J', 'Svingen PA', 'Hallgren CG', 'Weisberg E', 'Kottke TJ', 'Narayanan VL', 'Litzow MR', 'Griffin JD', 'Sausville EA', 'Tefferi A', 'Kaufmann SH']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55901, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Hydroquinones)', '0 (NSC 680410)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Serpins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '0 (X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein)', '0 (XIAP protein, human)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', '96282-35-8 (interleukin-1beta-converting enzyme inhibitor)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'PJY633525U (Adamantane)']",IM,,"['Adamantane/analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzamides', 'Caspase 9', 'Caspases/genetics/metabolism', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Induction', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Hydroquinones/*pharmacology', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'K562 Cells/*drug effects/enzymology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/enzymology/genetics/*pathology', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/drug effects', 'Proteins/genetics', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/physiology', 'Serpins/genetics/metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay', '*Viral Proteins', 'X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein']",2002/01/10 10:00,2002/02/14 10:01,['2002/01/10 10:00'],"['2002/01/10 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/14 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/10 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2002 Jan 15;99(2):664-71. doi: 10.1182/blood.v99.2.664.,,"['10.1182/blood.v99.2.664 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)38351-8 [pii]']",,,,,,"['T32 CA09441/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA85972/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA085972/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA069008/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA69008/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,

Its efficacy, however, is compromised by the emergence of resistant cells. In the present study, 3 CdA-resistant cell lines were generated and characterized. Their ability to accumulate 2-chloroadenosine triphosphate (CdATP) varied, reflecting differences in activities of deoxycytidine kinase (dCK) and deoxyguanosine kinase (dGK). Nonetheless, the selected lines were uniformly resistant to CdA-induced apoptosis, as assessed by caspase activation and DNA fragmentation. In contrast, cytosols from resistant cells were capable of robust caspase activation when incubated in the presence of cytochrome c and dATP. Moreover, replacement of dATP with CdATP also resulted in caspase activation in the parental and some of the resistant cell lines. Strikingly, CdA-induced decreases in mitochondrial transmembrane potential and release of cytochrome c from mitochondria were observed in the parental cells but not in any resistant lines. The lack of cytochrome c release correlated with an increased ability of mitochondria from resistant cells to sequester free Ca2+. Consistent with this enhanced Ca2+ buffering capacity, an early increase in cytosolic Ca2+ after CdA treatment of parental cells but not resistant cells was detected. Furthermore, CdA-resistant cells were selectively cross-resistant to thapsigargin but not to staurosporine- or Fas-induced apoptosis. In addition, CdA-induced caspase-3 activation and DNA fragmentation were inhibited by the Ca2+ chelator BAPTA-AM in sensitive cells. Taken together, the data indicate that the mechanism of resistance to CdA may be dictated by changes in Ca2+-sensitive mitochondrial events.","['Chandra, Joya', 'Mansson, Emma', 'Gogvadze, Vladimir', 'Kaufmann, Scott H', 'Albertioni, Freidoun', 'Orrenius, Sten']","['Chandra J', 'Mansson E', 'Gogvadze V', 'Kaufmann SH', 'Albertioni F', 'Orrenius S']","['Institute for Environmental Medicine, Division of Toxicology, and Department of Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden. chandra.joya@mayo.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Chelating Agents)', '0 (Cytochrome c Group)', '0 (Deoxyadenine Nucleotides)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (cladribine triphosphate)', ""139890-68-9 (1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid"", 'acetoxymethyl ester)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)', '526U7A2651 (Egtazic Acid)', '67526-95-8 (Thapsigargin)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor))', 'EC 2.7.1.113 (deoxyguanosine kinase)', 'EC 2.7.1.74 (Deoxycytidine Kinase)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)', ""K8KCC8SH6N (2'-deoxyadenosine triphosphate)""]",IM,,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/*analogs & derivatives/biosynthesis', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Calcium Signaling/drug effects/*physiology', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Chelating Agents/pharmacology', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Cladribine/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Cytochrome c Group/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Deoxyadenine Nucleotides/pharmacology', 'Deoxycytidine Kinase/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Egtazic Acid/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Intracellular Membranes/physiology', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/*enzymology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects/enzymology', 'Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor)/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/analysis', 'Staurosporine/pharmacology', 'Thapsigargin/pharmacology']",2002/01/10 10:00,2002/02/14 10:01,['2002/01/10 10:00'],"['2002/01/10 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/14 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/10 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2002 Jan 15;99(2):655-63. doi: 10.1182/blood.v99.2.655.,,"['10.1182/blood.v99.2.655 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)38350-6 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the mechanisms underlying the regulation of P-glycoprotein functions remain unclear. On the basis of some evidence suggesting P-glycoprotein-actin cytoskeleton interaction, this study investigated the association of P-glycoprotein with ezrin, radixin, and moesin, a class of proteins that cross-link actin filaments with plasma membrane in a human cell line of lymphoid origin and that have been shown to link other ion-pump-related proteins. To this purpose, a multidrug-resistant variant of CCRF-CEM cells (CEM-VBL100) was used as a model to investigate the following: (1) the cellular localizations of P-glycoprotein and ezrin, radixin, and moesin and their molecular associations; and (2) the effects of ezrin, radixin, and moesin antisense oligonucleotides on multidrug resistance and P-glycoprotein function. The results showed that: (1) P-glycoprotein colocalized and coimmunoprecipitated with ezrin, radixin, and moesin; and (2) treatment with antisense oligonucleotides for ezrin, radixin, and moesin restored drug susceptibility consistently with inhibition of both drug efflux and actin-P-glycoprotein association and induction of cellular redistribution of P-glycoprotein. These data suggest that P-glycoprotein association with the actin cytoskeleton through ezrin, radixin, and moesin is key in conferring to human lymphoid cells a multidrug resistance phenotype.

Although several cytokines such as interleukin 1 and parathyroid hormone-related protein are thought to be involved in the development of high serum Ca(++) levels, its precise underlying mechanism remains unknown. This study analyzed the expression of various genes that are thought to regulate serum Ca(++) levels in ATL and showed that the overexpression of the receptor activator of nuclear factor kappaB (RANK) ligand gene correlated with hypercalcemia. ATL cells from patients with hypercalcemia, which highly expressed the transcripts of the RANK ligand (RANKL) gene, induced the differentiation of human hematopoietic precursor cells (HPCs) into OCLs in vitro in the presence of macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF). In contrast, ATL cells from patients without hypercalcemia did not induce such differentiation, suggesting that the induction of the differentiation correlated with the expression of the RANKL gene in ATL cells. Cell differentiation was suppressed by osteoprotegerin/Fc, an inhibitor of RANKL, indicating that such differentiation occurred through the RANK-RANKL pathway. In addition, direct contact between ATL cells and HPCs was essential for the differentiation, suggesting that not the soluble form but membrane-bound RANKL played a role in this process. These results strongly suggested that ATL cells induce the differentiation of HPCs to OCLs through RANKL expressed on their surface, in cooperation with M-CSF, and ultimately cause hypercalcemia.","['Nosaka, Kisato', 'Miyamoto, Takeshi', 'Sakai, Tatsunori', 'Mitsuya, Hiroaki', 'Suda, Toshio', 'Matsuoka, Masao']","['Nosaka K', 'Miyamoto T', 'Sakai T', 'Mitsuya H', 'Suda T', 'Matsuoka M']","['Laboratory of Virus Immunology, Institute for Virus Research, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Osteoprotegerin)', '0 (PTHLH protein, human)', '0 (Parathyroid Hormone-Related Protein)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (RANK Ligand)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Receptor Activator of Nuclear Factor-kappa B)', '0 (Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (TNFRSF11A protein, human)', '0 (TNFRSF11B protein, human)', '0 (TNFSF11 protein, human)', '81627-83-0 (Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Resorption/blood/etiology', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Glycoproteins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hypercalcemia/*etiology/physiopathology', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*blood', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/physiology', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Osteoclasts/*pathology', 'Osteoprotegerin', 'Parathyroid Hormone-Related Protein', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Proteins/genetics', 'RANK Ligand', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Receptor Activator of Nuclear Factor-kappa B', 'Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear/metabolism', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Solubility', 'T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism']",2002/01/10 10:00,2002/02/14 10:01,['2002/01/10 10:00'],"['2002/01/10 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/14 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/10 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2002 Jan 15;99(2):634-40. doi: 10.1182/blood.v99.2.634.,,"['10.1182/blood.v99.2.634 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)38347-6 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Many patients achieve complete remission (CR). The prognostic uncertainty of negative qualitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays suggests the need to identify prognostically significant critical thresholds by real-time RT-PCR. A reliable and sensitive (10(-5)) real-time RT-PCR assay was set up for the evaluation of relevant CBFbeta-MYH11/ABL transcript ratios and was applied to the 21 patients with inv(16) AML routinely referred for cytogenetic and molecular monitoring in Seragnoli Institute (Bologna, Italy) since 1990. Among the 18 patients who underwent ablative chemotherapy, all achieved CR with a 3-year disease-free survival probability of 63% (95% CI, 40%-87%) and no recorded events after 26 months. Five patients had relapses; 2 died of disease and 3 entered second CR. Analysis of the 125 bone marrow (or peripheral blood) samples studied by real-time RT-PCR showed that transcript ratios of samples taken during CR at any time before a relapse were always greater than 0.12%, whereas those of samples taken during first or second CR from patients who did not subsequently have relapses were always less than 0.25%.

This review summarizes current immunocytochemical studies of these 2 categories of oncogenic protein, with emphasis on the clinical relevance of their detection in diagnostic samples. Among the quiescent genes activated by rearrangement, expression of cyclin D1 (due to rearrangement of the CCND1 [BCL-1] gene) is a near-specific marker of t(11;14) in mantle cell lymphoma; BCL-2 expression distinguishes follicular lymphoma cells from their nonneoplastic counterparts in reactive germinal centers and appears to be an independent prognostic marker in diffuse large cell lymphoma; and TAL-1 (SCL) expression identifies T-cell acute lymphoblastic neoplasms in which this gene is activated. The protein products of other genes activated by chromosomal rearrangement have a role as markers of either lineage (eg, PAX-5 [B-cell-specific activator protein] for B cells, including B-lymphoblastic neoplasms), or maturation stage (eg, BCL-6 for germinal-center and activated B cells and MUM-1/IRF4 for plasma cells). Currently, no hybrid protein encoded by fusion genes is reliably detectable by antibodies recognizing unique junctional epitopes (ie, epitopes absent from the wild-type constituent proteins). Nevertheless, staining for promyelocytic leukemia (PML) protein will detect acute PML with t(15;17) because the microspeckled nuclear labeling pattern for PML-RARalpha is highly distinctive. Similarly, antibodies to the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) tyrosine kinase are valuable (because wild-type ALK is not found in normal lymphoid tissue) in detecting neoplasms (CD30-positive large T-cell lymphomas) with t(2;5) or its variants. Thus, immunocytochemical detection of the products of many rearranged genes in lymphoma and leukemia can be clinically informative and provide information on cellular and subcellular protein expression that cannot be inferred from studies based on messenger RNA.","['Falini, Brunangelo', 'Mason, David Y']","['Falini B', 'Mason DY']","['Institute of Hematology, University of Perugia, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis/genetics/immunology', 'Cell Lineage', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosomes, Human/genetics/ultrastructure', 'Embryonal Carcinoma Stem Cells', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', '*Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia/classification/*diagnosis/genetics/metabolism', 'Lymphoma/classification/*diagnosis/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*analysis/genetics/immunology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/analysis/genetics/immunology', 'Oncogenes', 'Organ Specificity', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic/genetics']",2002/01/10 10:00,2002/02/14 10:01,['2002/01/10 10:00'],"['2002/01/10 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/14 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/10 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2002 Jan 15;99(2):409-26. doi: 10.1182/blood.v99.2.409.,,"['10.1182/blood.v99.2.409 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)38319-1 [pii]']",,299,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: From June 1997 to May 1999, forty leukemia patients with a median age of 35 years underwent allo-PBSCT. PBSC were mobilized with G-CSF at a dose of 5 micrograms/kg s.c. every 12 hours for 5 days. A median of 7.7 (2.0-16.8) x 10(6) CD34+ cells/kg was infused into the recipients. Busulfan-cyclophosphamide (BU-CY) was used as the conditioning regimen. All patients received cyclosporine A and either methotrexate (n = 34) or methylprednisolone (n = 6) for GVHD prophylaxis. RESULTS: Engraftment of neutrophils and platelets was achieved at a median of 13 days (9-28 days) and 12 days (7-60 days) respectively. Patients receiving > or = 4 x 10(6) CD34+ cells/kg or given G-CSF post transplant had significantly accelerated neutrophil and platelet engraftment. Acute GVHD occurred in 17 of 40 patients (42.5%), with grade II-IV acute GVHD in 10 patients (25%). Chronic GVHD developed in 21 (9 extensive, 12 limited) out of 30 evaluable patients (21/30, 70%) with a median follow up of 380 days (180-900 days). Transplant related mortality was 17.5% and the relapse rate was 10%. The probability of leukemia free survival at 3 years was 72.5%.

Open reading frame analysis and protein function prediction were also performed. Northern blot was used to detect the expression of SNC19 in various human normal tissues and tumor cell lines. Fluorescent in situ hybridization combined with fluorescent R-banding technique was employed to map the SNC19 gene on human chromosome. RESULTS: Full length SNC19 cDNA, size 3152 bp, encodes a protein highly homologous to a mouse serine protease epithin. In normal human tissues, high SNC19 expression levels were observed in the kidney, pancreas, prostate, small intestine and colon; moderate SNC19 expression levels were observed in the placenta, lung, liver, spleen thymus, testis and peripheral blood lymphocytes; and extremely low expression levels were observed in the heart, brain, skeletal muscle and ovary.

We also examined whether this model recreated the cellular phenotype of CML by assessing cell adhesion, cell migration, cell proliferation and cell survival. RESULTS: We found that significantly more myeloid colony forming units grew from p210BCR/ABL expressing cells, adhesion of p210BCR/ABL expressing CD34+ cells to fibronectin was decreased but migration over fibronectin was enhanced compared with mock transduced CD34+ cells. In this model, we showed that the presence of p210BCR/ABL leads to elevated levels of p27kip in p210BCR/ABL expressing CD34+ cells. We also showed that multidrug resistance-1 (MDR-1) Pgp was upregulated in the p210BCR/ABL expressing cells which correlates with the expression of p210BCR/ABL.

METHODS: Fifty-one patients were recruited in this auto-PBSCT study, in which several potentially important parameters were studied including the optimal time for stem cell collection, the dose of stem cell reinfusion, the time of hematopoietic reconstitution, the disease free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS), complications related to transplantation, and maintenance chemotherapy after auto-PBSCT. RESULTS: After APBSCT, 3-year and 5-year survival rates of NHL were 83.3%; those of AML were 74.7%; those of MM were 37.9% and 19%; those of ALL were 40% and 0% respectively. Hematopoietic reconstitution was greatly promoted by granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF). The mean time for patients' neutrophil to recover up to > 0.5 x 10(9)/L after APBSCT was 11.14 days in the group of the patients receiving G-CSF in contrast to 17.6 days in the group receiving no G-CSF. The most common complications of transplantation were fever, liver dysfunction and hypokalaemia, which were curable. No death was due to transplantation related complications. CONCLUSION: Comparing with conventional chemotherapy, our study suggests that auto-PBSCT is a very important therapeutic option that can significantly improve the prognosis in the patients with hematological and solid tumors, especially in the patients with AML and NHL.","['Ke, X', 'Yang, Y', 'Zhao, X', 'Wang, L']","['Ke X', 'Yang Y', 'Zhao X', 'Wang L']","['Hematology Department, Third Hospital, Peking University School of Medicine, Beijing 100083, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],China,Chin Med J (Engl),Chinese medical journal,7513795,['143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)'],IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Breast Neoplasms/mortality/pathology/therapy', 'Child', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/mortality/pathology/*therapy', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/mortality/pathology/therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/mortality/pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/mortality/pathology/therapy', 'Neoplasms/mortality/pathology/*therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/mortality/pathology/therapy', 'Survival Analysis', 'Survival Rate', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",2002/01/10 10:00,2002/02/14 10:01,['2002/01/10 10:00'],"['2002/01/10 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/14 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/10 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Chin Med J (Engl). 2001 Feb;114(2):196-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The donors for thirty patients (study group) with leukemia were given lenograstim 3-4 micrograms.kg-1.d-1 for seven days prior to marrow harvest. The results of subsequent engraftment in the recipients was compared with fifteen donors without G-CSF (control group). Five donors themselves were studied to assess the effects of lenograstion on hematopoietic progenitor cells and lymphocyte subsets in BM. RESULTS: The stimulated bone marrow contained a higher number of nucleated cells, CFU-GM and CD34+ cells (P < 0.01). The hematopoetic reconstitution was accelerated. Until granulocyte counts exceeded 0.5 x 10(9)/L and plalete counts exceeded 20 x 10(9)/L, the days were 16.7 +/- 3.2 and 18.4 +/- 3.0 days as compared with those of the control group (22.5 +/- 5.1 and 26.3 +/- 5.9 days respectively, P < 0.01). The incidence of grade II-IV aGVHD was very low, only one case with grade II aGVHD on the skin in the study group. Four out of fifteen patients (26.7%) in the control group had grade II-IV aGVHD (P < 0.05). The number of T lymphocyte subsets in the harvested BM stimulated by G-CSF changed. In comparison with the control group, CD4+ decreased and CD8+ increased significantly (P < 0.01). The changes of progenitor cells and T lymphocyte subsets in BM from pre- to post-G-CSF stimulation indicated that the percentage of CD4+ cells reduced (P < 0.05), that of CD8+ cells, and that of CD34+ increased (P < 0.01). The incidence of chronic GVHD and relapse of leukemia were not different significantly between both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Allogenic bone marrow transplant (Allo-BMT) donors given G-CSF can accelerate engraftment and minimize the incidence of severe aGVHD.

All RNA tumor viruses belong to the retrovirus family. Directly transforming Class I RNA tumor viruses carry cellular oncogenes, picked up by accidental recombination, and usually selected for secondary modifications and high tumorigenicity by the investigator. They are not known to play any role for tumor causation in nature. Class II or chronic RNA tumor viruses do not carry cell-derived oncogenes but they often act by proviral DNA insertion into the immediate neighborhood of a cellular oncogene. Feline, murine, and avian leukemia viruses belong to this category. The human adult T-cell leukemia virus, (HTLV-1) and bovine leukemia virus (BLV) act by expanding the preneoplastic cell population and thereby provides the soil for secondary, cellular changes. The DNA tumor viruses belong to three very different categories, the papovaviruses, adenoviruses and herpesviruses. Inactivation of the Rb and the p53 pathway by the viral transforming proteins is a convergent feature of the papova- and the adenoviruses. Since all DNA tumor viruses kill their host cell following their entry into the lytic phase, transformation and tumorigenicity are entirely dependent on a non-lytic interaction. Cells transformed by DNA tumor viruses depend on the continued expression of the virally encoded oncogene. They provide thereby a convenient target for the immune surveillance of the host. Depending on the epidemiological history of the virus in relation to its natural host species, the immune surveillance of the host and the strategy of viral latency and survival can evolve into a truly symbiotic relationship, as best illustrated by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Tumor development occurs only as an accident at the level of the host (immunosuppression) or the cell (specific translocations or other genetic changes). The list of human viruses presently known to cause or to contribute to tumor development comprise four DNA viruses, namely Epstein-Barr virus, certain human papilloma viruses subtypes, hepatitis B virus, and Kaposi sarcoma herpesvirus (HHV-8); and two RNA viruses, adult T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV-1) and hepatitis virus C.","['Klein, George']",['Klein G'],"['Microbiology and Tumor Biology Center (MTC), Karolinska Institutet, S-171 77 Stockholm, Sweden. georg.klein@mtc.ki.se']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Front Biosci,Frontiers in bioscience : a journal and virtual library,9709506,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (RNA, Viral)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'DNA Tumor Viruses/genetics/pathogenicity', 'DNA, Viral/genetics', 'Gammaretrovirus/genetics/pathogenicity', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/genetics/pathogenicity', 'Humans', 'Oncogenic Viruses/genetics/*pathogenicity', 'RNA, Viral/genetics', 'Retroviridae/genetics/pathogenicity', 'Virus Replication/genetics']",2002/01/10 10:00,2002/04/18 10:01,['2002/01/10 10:00'],"['2002/01/10 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/04/18 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/10 10:00 [entrez]']",epublish,Front Biosci. 2002 Jan 1;7:d268-74. doi: 10.2741/A726.,,['10.2741/A726 [doi]'],,13,,,,,,,20020101,,,

METHODS: PCA from freshly isolated APL blasts from APL patients treated with ATRA or As2O3 was detected using a one-stage clotting assay. TF antigen was detected by ELISA and TF mRNA by RT-PCR. The maturation sensitive (NB4) or resistant subclones (NB4-R1) of the promyelocytic NB4 cell line, as well as U937 cells infected with pMSCV-PML-RARa treated with or without ATRA or As2O3, were also examined. RESULTS: Both ATRA and As2O3 can down-regulate the TF antigen, its mRNA transcription and membrane PCA of APL cells in vivo and in vitro, in a time-dependent manner. The TF antigen level in PML-RARa + U937 cells was significantly higher than that in U937 cells infected with retrovirus vector. Both ATRA and As2O3 can also down-regulate the TF antigen in U937 cells transfected with or without PML-RARa. CONCLUSION: Tissue factor expression and PCA in APL cells may be down-regulated by ATRA and As2O3. By down-regulating TF expression, As2O3 might also be used to improve the DIC-related hemorrhage in APL. Our data indicate that elevated TF antigen in PML-RARa + U937 may be related to the fusion protein PML-RARa. The down-regulating effect of ATRA and As2O3 on TF expression in U937 cells might not involve this fusion protein.","['Guo, W', 'Wang, H', 'Zhao, W', 'Zhu, J', 'Ju, B', 'Wang, X']","['Guo W', 'Wang H', 'Zhao W', 'Zhu J', 'Ju B', 'Wang X']","['Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Ruijin Hospital Affiliated Shanghai Second Medical University, Shanghai 200025, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],China,Chin Med J (Engl),Chinese medical journal,7513795,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '9035-58-9 (Thromboplastin)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/physiology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/physiology', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/*analysis', 'Thromboplastin/*genetics', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/01/10 10:00,2002/02/15 10:01,['2002/01/10 10:00'],"['2002/01/10 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/15 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/10 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Chin Med J (Engl). 2001 Jan;114(1):30-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: MOLT-4 cells pretreated with 0.5 microg/ml cycloheximide for 1h were exposed to 7.5Gy of X-rays. The appearance of apoptosis, expression of Fas, activation of caspases-3, -8, -9, SAPK/JNK and AP-1, the release of mitochondrial cytochrome-C and the formation of death-induced signalling complex (DISC) between Fas and the Fas-associated death domain (FADD) were measured by fluorescence microscopy, Western blotting, flow cytometry, gel shift assay and immunoprecipitation, respectively. RESULTS: Nuclear fragmentation and chromatin condensation were observed at 6 h after X-irradiation and gradually increased up to 12 h. These phenomena were significantly attenuated by cycloheximide. Cycloheximide also inhibited the activation of caspases and AP-1, the expression of Fas, the formation of DISC and the release of cytochrome-C, but not the activation of SAPK/JNK in X-irradiated MOLT-4 cells. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that apoptosis of X-ray-induced MOLT-4 cells is dependent on the activation of caspases regulated by de novo protein synthesis through SAPK/JNK activation.","['Takahashi, Kenji', 'Inanami, Osamu', 'Hayashi, Masanobu', 'Kuwabara, Mikinori']","['Takahashi K', 'Inanami O', 'Hayashi M', 'Kuwabara M']","['Laboratory of Radiation Biology, Department of Environmental Veterinary Sciences, Graduate School of Veterinary Medicine, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, 060-0818, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Int J Radiat Biol,International journal of radiation biology,8809243,"['0 (Arabidopsis Proteins)', '0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Cytochrome c Group)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-1)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'EC 1.14.19.- (Fatty Acid Desaturases)', 'EC 1.14.99.- (Fad7 protein, Arabidopsis)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 4)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP2K4 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP8 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,,"['*Apoptosis', '*Arabidopsis Proteins', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspase 8', 'Caspase 9', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Chromatin/metabolism', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'Cytochrome c Group/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Fatty Acid Desaturases/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Leukemia/*metabolism/*pathology', '*MAP Kinase Kinase 4', 'Membrane Potentials', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Mitochondria/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases/metabolism', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Protein Binding', '*Protein Biosynthesis', '*Signal Transduction', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription Factor AP-1/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', '*X-Rays']",2002/01/10 10:00,2002/02/20 10:01,['2002/01/10 10:00'],"['2002/01/10 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/20 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/10 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Radiat Biol. 2002 Feb;78(2):115-24. doi: 10.1080/09553000110076472.,,['10.1080/09553000110076472 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Tyrosine kinase receptors specific for certain growth factors represent attractive target molecules for anticancer therapy. SU5416 is a competitive inhibitor of VEGF receptor subtypes VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 and stem cell factor receptor c-kit. Preclinical evidence shows that SU5416 effectively inhibits VEGF-induced endothelial cell proliferation and slows growth of subcutaneous solid tumor xenografts.

The specificity of these discussed molecular approaches is controversial. Biological interference of the cytokeratin-20 and mammaglobin rtPCR assays has been investigated. Cell lines of different lineages and bone marrow and peripheral stem cells from patients without epithelial cancer have been examined for the transcription of the cytokeratin-20 (CK20) and mammaglobin messages prior to and after stimulation with different cytokines in a total of 370 liquid cultures. Amplification of both messages from clinical samples prior to stimulation does not support the high specificity for the detection of disseminated epithelial cancer cells as reported. Cytokeratin-20 was amplified from the chronic myeloic leukemia (CML)-derived line K562. Transcription was not influenced by cytokines, either in cell-line experiments or in clinical samples. The thesis of a low-level background transcription in granulocytes is supported. Mammaglobin was induced in cell lines significantly by GM-CSF and in clinical samples additionally by several more cytokines. These results indicate that under certain conditions involving cytokine production, the use of mammaglobin rtPCR for the detection of epithelial cancer cells could be limited. In conclusion, the mechanism of interference of both rtPCR assays are completely different and further research is necessary before the cytokeratin-20 or mammaglobin rtPCR could become standard methods for the detection of disseminated epithelial cancer cells. These factors leading to so-called false-positive results have to be considered in future applications of rtPCR for the detection of minimal residual disease.","['Kruger, W H', 'Jung, R', 'Detlefsen, B', 'Mumme, S', 'Badbaran, A', 'Brandner, J', 'Renges, H', 'Kroger, N', 'Zander, A R']","['Kruger WH', 'Jung R', 'Detlefsen B', 'Mumme S', 'Badbaran A', 'Brandner J', 'Renges H', 'Kroger N', 'Zander AR']","['Department of Oncology/Haematology, University-Hospital Eppendorf Hamburg, Germany. william.krueger@medizin.uni-halle.de']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Med Oncol,"Medical oncology (Northwood, London, England)",9435512,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Intermediate Filament Proteins)', '0 (KRT20 protein, human)', '0 (Keratin-20)', '0 (Mammaglobin A)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (SCGB2A2 protein, human)', '9060-09-7 (Uteroglobin)']",IM,,"['Carcinoma/*diagnosis/genetics', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'False Positive Reactions', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Intermediate Filament Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Keratin-20', 'Mammaglobin A', 'Neoplasm Metastasis/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/*standards', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Uteroglobin/*biosynthesis']",2002/01/10 10:00,2002/02/13 10:01,['2002/01/10 10:00'],"['2002/01/10 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/13 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/10 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Med Oncol. 2001;18(1):33-8. doi: 10.1385/MO:18:1:33.,,"['MO:18:1:33 [pii]', '10.1385/MO:18:1:33 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The lesions were categorized using the Revised European American Lymphoma classification of lymphoid tissues and analysed to determine the frequency and prognostic impact of tumour type, location, stage and patient's age and sex. METHODS: The clinical, histopathological, immunohistochemical and phenotypic analysis by flow cytometry and follow-up data were studied. RESULTS: The ocular adnexal lymphoproliferative lesions included 70 lymphomas and six reactive lymphoid hyperplasia. Seventy-nine per cent had stage IE disease, 4% stage II, 1.5% stage III and 15.5% stage IV. Five patients (7%) had a past history of systemic lymphoma. Major histological types were extranodal marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) in 44 (63%), follicular (FL) in 12 (17%), diffuse large B-cell (DLBCL) in eight (11%), mantle cell (MCL) in two (3%), B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL)/small lymphocytic lymphoma in two (3%), peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) one (1.5%) and natural killer cell lymphoma (NKCL) in one (1.5%). Longest survival was seen in those with low-grade lymphomas (MZL and FL) and worst in PTCL and NKCL. Lymphoma-related mortality was 2% for MZL, 33% for FL, 38% for DLBCL, and 100% for MCL, PTCL and NKCL. Systemic lymphoma was present prior to, at presentation or at subsequent follow up in 26/68 (39%) of all lymphoma patients, 17% for MZL, 38% for DLBCL, 83% for FL, and 100% for MCL, CLL, PTCL and NKCL. CONCLUSION: The majority of ocular adnexal lymphomas were low-grade B-cell lymphomas (MZL). Multivariate analysis showed that the only significant independent predictors of all causes of mortality were the histological type of lymphoma and the stage of disease at presentation.","['McKelvie, P A', 'McNab, A', 'Francis, I C', 'Fox, R', ""O'Day, J""]","['McKelvie PA', 'McNab A', 'Francis IC', 'Fox R', ""O'Day J""]","[""Department of Anatomical Pathology, St Vincent's Hospital, Fitzroy, Victoria, Australia. mckelvpa@svhm.org.au""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Australia,Clin Exp Ophthalmol,Clinical & experimental ophthalmology,100896531,,IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Conjunctival Neoplasms/classification/mortality/*pathology', 'Eyelid Neoplasms/classification/mortality/*pathology', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Lymphoma/classification/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Orbital Neoplasms/classification/mortality/*pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Rate']",2002/01/10 10:00,2002/05/03 10:01,['2002/01/10 10:00'],"['2002/01/10 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/05/03 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/10 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Clin Exp Ophthalmol. 2001 Dec;29(6):387-93. doi: 10.1046/j.1442-9071.2001.d01-18.x.,,['10.1046/j.1442-9071.2001.d01-18.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Campath-1H has been used in B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL), T-prolymphocytic leukemia (T-PLL), and low-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (LGNHL). Campath-1H is administered intravenously thrice weekly for up to 12 wk, at an initial dose of 3 mg, escalated to 10 and 30 mg. The responses (complete [CR] and partial [PR]) obtained in untreated B-CLL patients are of the order of 90%. In previously treated B-CLL patients, responses are of the order of approximately 40%, with 2-4% CRs. Responses are more prominent in the blood and bone marrow compared to the lymph nodes. The median duration of response is 9-12 mo. Because of the antibody's higher activity on circulating lymphocytes, it has been used for in vivo purging of residual disease in B-CLL, followed by autologous stem-cell transplantation. In heavily pretreated advanced stage LGNHL, response is achieved only in 14% of cases with B-phenotype; a 50% response rate is noted in mycosis fungoides. In T-PLL, the CR rate is approximately 60%. Promising results have been reported in a small number of patients with refractory autoimmune thrombocytopenia of lymphoproliferative disorders. The main complications of Campath-1H treatment are caused by tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interleukin (IL)-6 release, usually during the first intravenous infusion, and include fever, rigor, nausea, vomiting, and hypotension responsive to steroids. These side effects are usually less severe with subsequent infusions and can be prevented by paracetamol and antihistamines. Immunosupression resulting from normal B- and T-lymphocyte depletion is frequent, resulting in an increased risk for opportunistic infections. More clinical trials in a larger number of patients are necessary to determine the exact role and indications of Campath-1H in lymphoproliferative disorders.","['Pangalis, G A', 'Dimopoulou, M N', 'Angelopoulou, M K', 'Tsekouras, C', 'Vassilakopoulos, T P', 'Vaiopoulos, G', 'Siakantaris, M P']","['Pangalis GA', 'Dimopoulou MN', 'Angelopoulou MK', 'Tsekouras C', 'Vassilakopoulos TP', 'Vaiopoulos G', 'Siakantaris MP']","['1st Department of Internal Medicine, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Laikon General Hospital, Greece. pangalis@otenet.gr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Med Oncol,"Medical oncology (Northwood, London, England)",9435512,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '3A189DH42V (Alemtuzumab)']",IM,,"['Alemtuzumab', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppression Therapy', 'Infections', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Interleukin-6/adverse effects/metabolism', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Prolymphocytic/*drug therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*drug therapy', 'Phenotype', 'Risk Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/adverse effects/metabolism']",2002/01/10 10:00,2002/02/13 10:01,['2002/01/10 10:00'],"['2000/10/08 00:00 [received]', '2000/10/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/01/10 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/13 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/10 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Med Oncol. 2001;18(2):99-107. doi: 10.1385/mo:18:2:99.,,"['MO:18:2:99 [pii]', '10.1385/mo:18:2:99 [doi]']",,60,,,,,,,,,,

HTLV-1 is exclusively detected in CD45RO+ T-cells in infected individuals, but CD45RO is weakly expressed in HTLV-1-transformed T-cell lines in vitro. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of CD45RO in the persistent HTLV-1 infection in vivo. Flow cytometry showed that only two out of eight interleukin(IL)-2-independent HTLV-1-transformed T-cell lines expressed CD45RO, whereas all five IL-2-dependent ones expressed CD45RO, and the level of expression was higher in IL-2-dependent than in IL-2-independent cells. The high CD45RO expression in IL-2-dependent cell lines was not due to IL-2, since IL-2 had little effect on the expression of CD45RO in T-cell lines. Using western blotting, we showed that IL-2-dependent HTLV-1-transformed T-cell lines expressed a lower level of expression of the viral transcriptional regulatory protein Tax than IL-2-independent ones, and that the level of expression correlated inversely with that of CD45RO. However, the expression of Tax in one HTLV-1-negative T-cell line little affected the expression of CD45RO, suggesting that Tax at least alone does not suppress the expression of CD45RO in HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines, and that other viral or cellular factor(s) are probably involved in such suppression. Our results suggest that CD45RO+ Tax-low IL-2-dependent T-cell lines in vitro correspond to the persistent HTLV-1-infected cells in vivo, and HTLV-1-infected cells in vivo are immortalized in IL-2-dependent manner.","['Moro, H', 'Iwai, K', 'Mori, N', 'Watanabe, M', 'Fukushi, M', 'Oie, M', 'Arai, M', 'Tanaka, Y', 'Miyawaki, T', 'Gejyo, F', 'Arakawa, M', 'Fujii, M']","['Moro H', 'Iwai K', 'Mori N', 'Watanabe M', 'Fukushi M', 'Oie M', 'Arai M', 'Tanaka Y', 'Miyawaki T', 'Gejyo F', 'Arakawa M', 'Fujii M']","['Department of Virology, Niigata University School of Medicine, Asahimachi-Dori, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Virus Genes,Virus genes,8803967,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 1)']",IM,,"['Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Gene Products, tax', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/*metabolism', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens/biosynthesis/*physiology', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 1', 'Signal Transduction', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism/*virology', 'Virus Latency']",2002/01/10 10:00,2002/08/24 10:01,['2002/01/10 10:00'],"['2002/01/10 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/24 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/10 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Virus Genes. 2001 Dec;23(3):263-71. doi: 10.1023/a:1012565105098.,,['10.1023/a:1012565105098 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

We then studied the effects of this element alone and in combination with other cis-acting elements on globin gene chromatin structure and gene expression in MEL cells and transgenic mice. Single or tandem HSFEs increased the size of the portion of the promoter accessible to DNase digestion, increased the proportion of promoters in an accessible conformation, and increased gene expression approximately 5-fold. These were equivalent to expression levels attained using a 2.8-kb microLCR construct. Inclusion of the LCR HS2 enhancer did not increase expression further. In transgenic mouse fetal liver cells the HSFE increased average expression 2.5-fold compared to the minimal promoter alone.

Subgroup analysis of leukemic patients suggested that patients in the induction phase of therapy have a higher rate of bacteremia and pneumonia. No substantial difference in course or outcome was seen between the leukemia and solid tumor groups, possibly because of the intensive treatment administered to pediatric patients with solid tumors.

METHODS: RT-PCR was used for PML-RAR alpha mRNA expression, trypan blue exclusion for cell count, methylcellulose assay for leukemic colony forming unit, immuno-fluorescence for PML-RAR alpha/PML protein localization. RESULTS: Both anti-PML start codon region antisense (STAS) and anti-PML-RAR alpha fusion region antisense (FUAS) could inhibit cell growth and formation AML-CFU. Cells became partially differentiated on day 5, being more marked in FUAS-treated cells than in STAS-treated ones.

Immuno-fluorescence analysis with anti-PML monoclonal antibody showed a remarkable decrease to almost complete disappearance of microgranules. The residual granules became enlarged to become discrete dots (< 10 per cell), similar to normal POD structure in some STAS-treated cells at 24 h. AT 72 h, nearly all the granules disappeared.

The As2O3-treated cells were examined for glutathione (GSH) level and activity of catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione S-transferase (GST) and glutathione peroxidase (GPX). RESULTS: Of the 9 cell lines examined, the acute promyelocytic leukemia cell line NB4 and its retinoic acid-resistant subclones R2 and MR2, the Burkitt lymphoma cell line Namalwa and multiple myeloma cell line RPMI 8226 were sensitive to As2O3-induced apoptosis while the acute T cell leukemia cell line (Jurkat) and 3 cell lines (HL-60, U937, K562) of myelogenous leukemia origin were not. In comparison with the sensitive cell lines, higher activity of CAT was found in HL-60 and U937, higher level of GSH in Jurkat, and both in K562.

Because the MHC class II transactivator (CIITA) is essential for MHC class II expression, we have investigated transcriptional activation of CIITA in activated T cells. In this study, we show that in human activated CD4(+) T cells, CIITA promoter III (CIITA-PIII) drives the expression of CIITA. The in vivo genomic footprint analysis revealed activated T cell-specific occupation of CIITA-PIII. Subsequent EMSA analysis of several promoter regions showed differences in banding pattern among activated T cells, naive T cells, primary B cells, and Raji B cells. Activating response element (ARE)-1 is shown to interact with the acute myeloid leukemia 2 transcription factor in nuclear extracts derived from both T and B cells. Interestingly, the acute myeloid leukemia 3 transcription factor was bound in nuclear extracts of T cells only. The ARE-2 sequence is able to bind CREB/activating transcription factor family members in both T and B cells. In addition, a yet unidentified Ets family member was found to interact with site C in activated T cells, whereas in B cells site C was bound by PU.1 and Pip/IFN regulatory factor 4/IFN consensus sequence binding protein for activated T cells. In Jurkat T cells, both ARE-1 and ARE-2 are crucial for CIITA-PIII activity, similar to Raji B cells. The differential banding pattern in in vivo genomic footprinting and transcription factor binding at the ARE-1 and site C between T cells and B cells probably reflects differences in CIITA-PIII activation pathways employed by these cell types.","['Holling, Tjadine M', 'van der Stoep, Nienke', 'Quinten, Edwin', 'van den Elsen, Peter J']","['Holling TM', 'van der Stoep N', 'Quinten E', 'van den Elsen PJ']","['Division of Molecular Biology, Department of Immunohematology and Blood Transfusion, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)', '0 (MHC class II transactivator protein)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)']",IM,,"['B-Lymphocytes/immunology/metabolism', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites/genetics/immunology', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte/genetics/*metabolism', 'Genetic Vectors/immunology', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/*biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', '*Lymphocyte Activation/genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/*immunology', 'Response Elements/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/*metabolism', 'Trans-Activators/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transfection']",2002/01/05 10:00,2002/02/01 10:01,['2002/01/05 10:00'],"['2002/01/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/01 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/05 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2002 Jan 15;168(2):763-70. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.168.2.763.,,['10.4049/jimmunol.168.2.763 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we characterized the TWEAK-induced cell death in several tumor cell lines that exhibited distinct features. Although the TWEAK-induced cell death in Kym-1 cells was indirectly mediated by TNF-alpha and was inhibited by cycloheximide, the TWEAK-induced cell death in HSC3 cells or IFN-gamma-treated HT-29 cells was not inhibited by anti-TNF-alpha mAb or cycloheximide, suggesting a direct triggering of cell death via TWEAK receptor in the latter cell lines. The TWEAK-induced apoptosis in HSC3 cells and IFN-gamma-treated HT-29 cells was associated with caspase-8 and caspase-3 activation. Although a pan-caspase inhibitor, benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone, inhibited the TWEAK-induced cell death in HSC3 cells, it rather sensitized HT-29 cells to TWEAK-induced cell death by necrosis. This necrosis was abrogated by lysosomal proteinase inhibitors, particularly a cathepsin B inhibitor, [L-3-trans-(propylcarbamoyl)oxirane-2-carbonyl]-L-isoleucyl-L-proline methyl ester. During the process of TWEAK-induced necrosis, cathepsin B was released from lysosome to cytosol. Although DR3 has been reported to be a receptor for TWEAK, all TWEAK-sensitive tumor cell lines used in this study did not express DR3 at either protein or mRNA level, but did bind CD8-TWEAK specifically. These results indicated that TWEAK could induce multiple pathways of cell death, including both caspase-dependent apoptosis and cathepsin B-dependent necrosis, in a cell type-specific manner via TWEAK receptor(s) distinct from DR3.","['Nakayama, Masafumi', 'Ishidoh, Kazumi', 'Kayagaki, Nobuhiko', 'Kojima, Yuko', 'Yamaguchi, Noriko', 'Nakano, Hiroyasu', 'Kominami, Eiki', 'Okumura, Ko', 'Yagita, Hideo']","['Nakayama M', 'Ishidoh K', 'Kayagaki N', 'Kojima Y', 'Yamaguchi N', 'Nakano H', 'Kominami E', 'Okumura K', 'Yagita H']","['Department of Immunology, Allergy Research Center, Division of Pathology, Central Laboratory of Medical Sciences, Juntendo University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Cytokine TWEAK)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Member 25)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Type I)', '0 (TNFRSF25 protein, human)', '0 (TNFSF12 protein, human)', '0 (TWEAK Receptor)', '0 (Tnfrsf25 protein, mouse)', '0 (Tnfsf12 protein, mouse)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factors)', '0 (benzyloxycarbonylvalyl-alanyl-aspartyl fluoromethyl ketone)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'EC 3.4.22.1 (Cathepsin B)']",IM,,"['Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD/physiology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/*immunology', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'Carrier Proteins/metabolism/*physiology', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cathepsin B/physiology', 'Cell Death/drug effects/immunology', 'Cytokine TWEAK', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects/immunology', 'HT29 Cells', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/physiology', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia L5178/metabolism', 'Ligands', 'Mice', 'Necrosis', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/biosynthesis/physiology', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Member 25', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Type I', 'Signal Transduction/*immunology', 'TWEAK Receptor', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/physiology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factors']",2002/01/05 10:00,2002/02/01 10:01,['2002/01/05 10:00'],"['2002/01/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/01 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/05 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2002 Jan 15;168(2):734-43. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.168.2.734.,,['10.4049/jimmunol.168.2.734 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

We hypothesize that BCR/ABL may be directly responsible by interfering with NK cell differentiation. CD34(+)HLA-DR(+) cells from CML patients were studied for their capacity to differentiate into NK cells. The NK cell cloning frequency was significantly decreased from CML CD34(+)HLA-DR(+) cells compared with cells from normal donors, yet CD34(+)HLA-DR(+) cells gave rise to BCR/ABL(+) NK cells in some patients. This finding prompted us to further investigate circulating NK cells from the blood of CML patients. CD56(+)CD3(-) NK cells were sorted from CML patients and examined by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). In contrast to chronic phase CML, significant numbers of NK cells from advanced phase CML patients were BCR/ABL(+), whereas T cells were always BCR/ABL(-) regardless of the disease stage. To test the effects of BCR/ABL as the sole genetic abnormality, BCR/ABL was transduced into umbilical cord blood CD34(+) cells, and NK development was studied. p210-enhanced green fluorescence protein-transduced cells gave rise to significantly decreased numbers of NK cells compared with enhanced green fluorescence protein transduction alone. In addition, the extrinsic addition of BCR/ABL-transduced autologous CD34(+) cells suppressed the NK cell differentiation of normal umbilical cord blood CD34(+)CD38(-) cells. This study provides the first evidence that BCR/ABL is responsible for the altered differentiation of NK cells and that the NK cell lineage can be involved with the malignant clone in advanced stage CML.","['Nakajima, Hikaru', 'Zhao, Robert', 'Lund, Troy C', 'Ward, Jeanne', 'Dolan, Michelle', 'Hirsch, Betsy', 'Miller, Jeffrey S']","['Nakajima H', 'Zhao R', 'Lund TC', 'Ward J', 'Dolan M', 'Hirsch B', 'Miller JS']","['Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota Cancer Center, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/biosynthesis', 'Blast Crisis/genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics/immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Clone Cells/immunology/pathology', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*blood/*genetics/physiology', 'Genes, abl/*immunology', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'Hematopoiesis/genetics/immunology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/immunology/pathology', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/*genetics/*immunology/pathology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Luminescent Proteins/genetics', 'Mice', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Transgenes/*immunology']",2002/01/05 10:00,2002/02/01 10:01,['2002/01/05 10:00'],"['2002/01/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/01 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/05 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2002 Jan 15;168(2):643-50. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.168.2.643.,,['10.4049/jimmunol.168.2.643 [doi]'],,,,,,"['M0-1-RR00400/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'P01-CA-65493/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-HL-55417/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,

The maxizyme under the control of a tRNA(Val) promoter showed significant inhibition against the growth of the primary bone marrow cells from a Japanese patient with CML. Specifically, to examine the applicability of the maxizyme in the treatment of CML, we assessed the antitumor effect of the maxizyme in murine models of CML. Fourteen weeks after the injection of primary CML cells into a NOD-SCID mouse, the bone marrow of the mouse was filled with primary CML cells as a result of diffuse leukemia. In marked contrast, when maxizyme-expressing primary CML cells were injected, the mouse remained disease-free. These results further strengthen our earlier suggestion that the maxizyme technology might provide a useful approach to the treatment of CML.","['Kuwabara, T', 'Tanabe, T', 'Warashina, M', 'Xiong, K X', 'Tani, K', 'Taira, K', 'Asano, S']","['Kuwabara T', 'Tanabe T', 'Warashina M', 'Xiong KX', 'Tani K', 'Taira K', 'Asano S']","['Gene Discovery Research Center, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), 1-1-1 Higashi, Tsukuba Science City 305-8562, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Biomacromolecules,Biomacromolecules,100892849,"['0 (RNA, Catalytic)']",IM,,"['*Allosteric Regulation', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Drug Design', 'Genetic Therapy/methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/pathology/*therapy', 'Leukemic Infiltration/prevention & control/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'RNA, Catalytic/*administration & dosage/*genetics/therapeutic use', 'Transduction, Genetic/methods', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",2002/01/05 10:00,2003/05/13 05:00,['2002/01/05 10:00'],"['2002/01/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/13 05:00 [medline]', '2002/01/05 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biomacromolecules. 2001 Winter;2(4):1220-8. doi: 10.1021/bm010107u.,,"['bm010107u [pii]', '10.1021/bm010107u [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The mechanism of resistance developed during this process was investigated. Apoptosis resistance was associated with an enhanced expression of X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP), an endogenous caspase inhibitor, in differentiated THP-1 cells. Bryo1 also increased the level of c-IAP-1, yet decreased the level of c-IAP-2 in THP-1 cells, indicating that distinct regulatory mechanisms are operative. In addition, treatment of THP-1 cells with bryo1 induced a rapid and sustained activation of MEK, prior to the upregulation of XIAP and monocytic differentiation. Pretreatment of THP-1 cells with MEK inhibitors (U0126 and PD98059) prior to bryo1 induction blocked the expression of both XIAP and the c-fms product (M-CSF receptor), a hallmark of monocytic differentiation, but not Bcl-2. In addition, the expression of XIAP in bryo1-treated cells was inhibited by CAPE, a NF-kappaB-specific inhibitor, indicating that its expression is under the transcriptional regulation of NF-kappaB downstream of the MEK/MAPK pathway. The importance of XIAP in mediating apoptosis resistance was illustrated in cells transiently transfected with XIAP, which conferred on THP-1 cells the ability to resist Z-LLL-CHO-induced apoptosis. These findings suggest that the expression of XIAP is linked to monocytic differentiation in bryo1-treated THP-1 cells and represents one of the potential antiapoptotic mechanisms acquired during this process.","['Lin, Hong', 'Chen, Catheryne', 'Li, Xiaohua', 'Chen, Ben D']","['Lin H', 'Chen C', 'Li X', 'Chen BD']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, Michigan 48201, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (Bryostatins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (I-kappa B Proteins)', '0 (Lactones)', '0 (Macrolides)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (NFKBIA protein, human)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein)', '0 (XIAP protein, human)', '139874-52-5 (NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha)', '37O2X55Y9E (bryostatin 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases)']",IM,,"['*Apoptosis', 'Bryostatins', 'Cell Differentiation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', '*I-kappa B Proteins', 'Lactones/pharmacology', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/*physiology', 'Macrolides', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases/*metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Monocytes/cytology/metabolism', 'NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Protein Biosynthesis', '*Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', '*Up-Regulation', 'X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein']",2002/01/05 10:00,2002/02/15 10:01,['2002/01/05 10:00'],"['2002/01/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/15 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/05 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 2002 Jan 15;272(2):192-8. doi: 10.1006/excr.2001.5417.,,"['10.1006/excr.2001.5417 [doi]', 'S0014482701954175 [pii]']",,,,['(c)2002 Elsevier Science.'],,['CA 73212/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,

The role of 1,25D3 in the induction of maturation has been shown to be a priming effect. Differentiation in response to these agents requires VDR-independent signaling of 1,25D3, PKC signaling, intracellular calcium, and calpain activity. In this study we identify the NFkappaB/IkappaB signaling pathway as a target of 1,25D3 and TPA action. One of the priming effects of 1,25D3 appears to be the rapid phosphorylation of serine residues on IkappaBalpha. On their own, 1,25D3, its analogs, and TPA do not alter IkappaBalpha expression; however, combinations of analogs with TPA result in a synergistic decrease in IkappaBalpha expression. Decreased expression of IkappaBalpha likely results from enhanced degradation, which allows the observed subsequent nuclear translocation of NFkappaB subunit p65. Since nuclear-localized NFkappaB was observed only in combination-treated cells, it is proposed that nuclear targets of NFkappaB are required for monocytic differentiation. Intracellular calcium and proteolytic activity are both necessary for the induction of IkappaB regulation and translocation of NFkappaB and are critical components of the nongenomic signaling cascades of the 1,25D3-induced differentiation pathway.","['Berry, Donna M', 'Clark, Christina S', 'Meckling-Gill, Kelly A']","['Berry DM', 'Clark CS', 'Meckling-Gill KA']","['Department of Human Biology and Nutritional Sciences, University of Guelph, Guelph, Ontario NIG 2W1, Canada.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (I-kappa B Proteins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (NFKBIA protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Calcitriol)', '0 (Transcription Factor RelA)', '139874-52-5 (NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (CHUK protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (I-kappa B Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (IKBKB protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (IKBKE protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Calpain)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,,"['Active Transport, Cell Nucleus', 'Calcitriol/*analogs & derivatives', 'Calcium Signaling', 'Calpain/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'I-kappa B Kinase', '*I-kappa B Proteins', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Monocytes/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism', 'Receptors, Calcitriol/metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription Factor RelA', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/01/05 10:00,2002/02/15 10:01,['2002/01/05 10:00'],"['2002/01/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/15 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/05 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 2002 Jan 15;272(2):176-84. doi: 10.1006/excr.2001.5410.,,"['10.1006/excr.2001.5410 [doi]', 'S0014482701954102 [pii]']",,,,['(c)2001 Elsevier Science.'],,,,,,,,

The grouping together of these genes which share spatial and temporal expression and interrelated functions is a remarkable genomic feature which has led to suggestions that the region may have a coordinated transcription control mechanism. With the growing awareness that the organization of the genome within the interphase nucleus is relevant to transcriptional activity, we have investigated the spatial organization of the EDC in the nuclei of keratinocytes, where the EDC genes are highly expressed, and lymphoblasts, where they are silent. Using 2D and 3D FISH we find that in keratinocyte nuclei the EDC is frequently positioned external to the chromosome 1 territory compared to lymphoblasts where the EDC more often adopts a peripheral or internal location. It has been previously shown that the MHC region can extend from the chromosome 6 territory in relation to transcriptional activity. This study of the EDC thus provides a further example of a gene-dense complex capable of assuming extraterritorial positioning in relation to cell type/transcription status.","['Williams, Ruth R E', 'Broad, Simon', 'Sheer, Denise', 'Ragoussis, Jiannis']","['Williams RR', 'Broad S', 'Sheer D', 'Ragoussis J']","[""Genomics Laboratory, King's College London, London, SE1 9RT, England, UK. ruth.williams@kcl.ac.uk""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,['0 (S100 Proteins)'],IM,,"['*B-Lymphocytes/cytology/physiology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Nucleus/physiology', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 1/*physiology', 'Epidermal Cells', 'Genes, MHC Class II', 'Granulocytes', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence/methods', 'Interphase/physiology', '*Keratinocytes/cytology/physiology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/genetics', 'S100 Proteins/genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/01/05 10:00,2002/02/15 10:01,['2002/01/05 10:00'],"['2002/01/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/15 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/05 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 2002 Jan 15;272(2):163-75. doi: 10.1006/excr.2001.5400.,,"['10.1006/excr.2001.5400 [doi]', 'S001448270195400X [pii]']",,,,['(c)2001 Elsevier Science.'],,['A3585/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom'],,,,,,

Arsenic trioxide and homoharringtonine (HHT) could inhibit proliferation of HL60 and ATRA-resistant HL60 cells, indicating no cross-resistance with ATRA. Interferon alpha (IFN-alpha) and PGE1 could significantly inhibit proliferation of ATRA-resistant HL60 cells and restore cell differentiation induced by ATRA. CONCLUSION: Drug resistance of APL to ATRA is not related to mdr-1. It can be reversed by IFN-alpha. There is no cross-resistance between HHT or arsenic trioxide and ATRA.","['Jiang, G', 'Tang, T', 'Bi, K']","['Jiang G', 'Tang T', 'Bi K']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Institute of Basic Medicine, Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences, Jinan 250062, China.']",['chi'],['Journal Article'],China,Zhonghua Zhong Liu Za Zhi,Zhonghua zhong liu za zhi [Chinese journal of oncology],7910681,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Harringtonines)', '0 (Interferon alpha-2)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '6FG8041S5B (Homoharringtonine)', 'F5TD010360 (Alprostadil)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,,"['Alprostadil/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/pharmacology', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/pharmacology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Resistance/physiology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Harringtonines/pharmacology', 'Homoharringtonine', 'Humans', 'Interferon alpha-2', 'Interferon-alpha/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Oxides/pharmacology', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology']",2002/01/05 10:00,2002/01/24 10:01,['2002/01/05 10:00'],"['2002/01/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/24 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/05 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Zhonghua Zhong Liu Za Zhi. 2000 Mar;22(2):154-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: In 53 CML patients, homozygous deletion of p16 gene was found in none of them in chronic phase, while in 6.3% (1/16) of them in myeloid blast crisis, 66.7% (8/12) in lymphoid blast crisis, and 2/5 (40%) in mixed cell blast crisis.

These cells spontaneously differentiate when allowed to aggregate in the absence of LIF, forming embryoid bodies in which early embryonic cell lineages develop. Using embryoid bodies cultured in the presence and absence of LIF, we show that although LIF inhibited the development of visceral and parietal endodermal cells, it did not affect the differentiation of the primitive endodermal cell precursors of these extraembryonic cell lineages. Furthermore, deposition of the basement membrane produced by the primitive endodermal cells, which separates them from the remaining cells of the embryoid body, still occurred. The differentiation of primitive ectodermal cells and their progeny was inhibited by LIF, as evidenced by the lack of expression of FGF-5, muscle, and neuronal markers. However, cavitation of the embryoid body and maintenance of the cells in contact with the primitive endodermal basement membrane as an epiblast epithelium still occurred normally in the presence of LIF. These results indicate that cavitation and formation of the epiblast epithelium are regulated by mechanisms distinct from those controlling the differentiation of epiblast cell lineages. Furthermore, although epithelium formation and cavitation do not require the differentiation of visceral endodermal cells, the results are consistent with the hypothesis that the primitive endodermal basement membrane is sufficient to induce the epithelialization of undifferentiated embryonic stem cells necessary for cavitation.","['Murray, P', 'Edgar, D']","['Murray P', 'Edgar D']","['Department of Human Anatomy and Cell Biology, The University of Liverpool, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Differentiation,Differentiation; research in biological diversity,0401650,"['0 (Fgf5 protein, mouse)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '129653-64-1 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 5)', '62031-54-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factors)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Embryo, Mammalian/*cytology', 'Endoderm/physiology', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 5', 'Fibroblast Growth Factors/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Stem Cells/*physiology']",2002/01/05 10:00,2002/04/19 10:01,['2002/01/05 10:00'],"['2002/01/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/04/19 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/05 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Differentiation. 2001 Oct;68(4-5):227-34. doi: 10.1046/j.1432-0436.2001.680410.x.,,"['S0301-4681(09)60408-4 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1432-0436.2001.680410.x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The DHPA-induced apoptosis was prevented by a pan-caspase inhibitor, Z-VAD-fmk, and a cysteine protease inhibitor, E-64d, which inhibits calpains and cathepsin B and L. A calpain inhibitor, Z-LL-H, did not affect this apoptosis. A cathepsin B specific inhibitor, CA074-Me, prevented only chromatin condensation. However, E-64d and a cathepsin L specific inhibitor, Z-FY(t-Bu)-dmk, protected the cells from both chromatin condensation and oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation.

In this process of recombination, the broken DNA molecules excised from different receptor gene loci are often joined to generate interlocus joints. The interlocus recombination process contributes to the translocation between antigen receptor genes and oncogenes, leading to the malignant transformation of lymphocytes. The alpha and delta chain of the T-cell receptor (TCR alpha/delta) locus at chromosome 14q11 is also a region where several types of chromosome translocations occur in T-cell malignancies. In the process of analyzing TCR alpha rearrangements in a patient with adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) carrying a translocation at chromosome 14q11, we found novel complex rearrangements in the Jalpha locus. On the one hand, the V2.3 gene is joined to the heptamernonamer recombination signal sequence of the J37 gene, and, on the other hand, the J37 gene is joined to the V2.3 recombination signal sequence through head-to-head fusion. These recombination products or hybrid joints originated through an inversion of about 70kb DNA. Interestingly, the inverted DNA stretch contains a normal V8.1-J40 rearrangement. These findings are the first direct demonstration that successive rearrangements with hybrid joints occur on the same chromosome in the human TCR alpha locus.","['Saitou, M', 'Sadamori, N', 'Isobe, M']","['Saitou M', 'Sadamori N', 'Isobe M']","['Department of Materials and Biosystem Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Toyama University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Hum Genet,Journal of human genetics,9808008,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', '*Gene Rearrangement, alpha-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor', '*Gene Rearrangement, delta-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*genetics/*immunology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid']",2002/01/05 10:00,2002/02/09 10:01,['2002/01/05 10:00'],"['2002/01/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/09 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/05 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Hum Genet. 2001;46(12):706-11. doi: 10.1007/s100380170004.,,['10.1007/s100380170004 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Telomerase activity was detected with telomeric repeat amplification protocol (TRAP) PCR ELISA kit in 41 cases of NPC, 14 cases of tissues adjacent to the carcinoma, and 19 cases of chronic nasopharyngitis, HNE1 cell lines of NPC, HL60 cell lines of leukemia, TUL1 cell lines of lung cancer, as well as three other kinds of normal control cells. The sensitivity and specificity of telomerase assay were also analyzed. Moreover, the expression of human telomerase RNA (hTR) was studied in 27 cases of NPC, 19 cases of adjacent nasopharyngeal tissues, and 17 cases of control groups by RT-nested PCR. RESULTS: The telomerase activity was found increased in NPC and in tissues adjacent to NPC with absorbance value (A value) of 1.15 U +/- 0.78 U and 1.04 U +/- 0.67 U respectively, compared with chronic nasopharyngitis (A = 0.18 U +/- 0.09 U). In NPC with cervical lymphnodes involvement the telomerase activity (A = 1.25 U +/- 0.79 U) was higher than in those without involvement (A = 1.02 U +/- 0.71 U), P < 0.05. The telomerase activity was also observed in HNE1 cell lines (A = 1.26 U +/- 0.97 U) and in other two kinds of cancer cell lines, but not in the three kinds of normal control cells. By contrast, no significant difference was seen in the expression of hTR among the three nasopharyngeal biopsy groups (P > 0.05). Finally, the sensitivity of telomerase assay was high (at an amount of 10(2) HNE1 cells), and the specificity was also high (after inactivation by heat or RNase, the telomerase activity was very low). CONCLUSIONS: A high frequency of telomerase activity is commonly seen in NPC, adjacent nasopharyngeal tissues, and HNE1 cell lines and is closely associated with NPC with cervical lymphnodes involvement. Both sensitivity and specificity of the telomerase assay are high. However, owing to the fact that the expression of hTR has no obvious difference between NPC and normal tissues and does not always correspond with the telomerase activity, it would be better to do TRAP as well as hTR assays for the activity and expression in assessing the carcinogenesis of NPC. So, more intensive study on the role of hTR in the carcinogenesis of NPC and on the exact relationship between hTR and telomerase is needed.","['Wen, Z', 'Xiao, J', 'Tang, F', 'Tian, Y', 'Zhao, S', 'Chen, B']","['Wen Z', 'Xiao J', 'Tang F', 'Tian Y', 'Zhao S', 'Chen B']","['Department of Ear, Nose and Throat, Xiangya Hospital, Hunan Medical University, Changsha 410008, China.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Chin Med J (Engl),Chinese medical journal,7513795,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nasopharyngeal Neoplasms/*enzymology', 'RNA, Messenger/*analysis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Telomerase/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/01/05 10:00,2002/02/08 10:01,['2002/01/05 10:00'],"['2002/01/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/08 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/05 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Chin Med J (Engl). 2000 Jun;113(6):525-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: As2O3 induced apoptosis in both HL-60S and HL-60R cells, As2O3-induced apoptosis was both time- and concentration-dependent in a therapeutically-achievable As2O3 range (0.25-4.0 mumol/L). Both all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and 9-cis retinoic acid (9cRA) potentiated As2O3-induced apoptosis, as measured by quantitative TdT fragment and labeling and flow cytometry assays in both HL-60S and HL-60R cells (P < 0.05, for all RA + As2O3 combinations vs As2O3 alone in both sublines). CONCLUSIONS: As2O3 may inhibit the growth of non-APL AML cells by promoting programmed cell death. RA can potentiate As2O3-induced apoptosis even in RA-resistant HL-60 cells in which the classical ATRA response pathway is repressed owing to a homozygous inactivating mutation in the retinoic acid receptor alpha. As2O3 can have clinical activity in non-APL cases of AML and the enhanced activity might result from the combined As2O3-RA therapy.","['Huang, X']",['Huang X'],"[""Institute of Hematology, People's Hospital, Beijing Medical University, Beijing 100044, China.""]",['chi'],['Journal Article'],China,Chin Med J (Engl),Chinese medical journal,7513795,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', '1UA8E65KDZ (Alitretinoin)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,,"['Alitretinoin', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Synergism', 'HL-60 Cells/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology']",2002/01/05 10:00,2002/02/08 10:01,['2002/01/05 10:00'],"['2002/01/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/08 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/05 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Chin Med J (Engl). 2000 Jun;113(6):498-501.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Seventy patients with newly-diagnosed APL in remission were involved in this study. Monitoring of minimal residual disease (MRD) was performed regularly by RT-PCR assay for PML-RAR alpha during consolidation. RESULTS: A 5-year relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall-survival (OS) were estimated as 46.8% +/- 8.4% and 69.9% +/- 9.4% for the whole group. Fifty-two (74.3%) patients got negative RT-PCR result at least once. Serial monitoring of RT-PCR was available in 38 cases and 24 (63.2%) patients presented with persistent negative PCR results. The achievement and continuous negative RT-PCR result was significantly related to the RFS. CONCLUSIONS: Achievement of negative RT-PCR in remission is associated with favorable RFS and OS. Continuous negative RT-PCR results are associated with long-term relapse-free survival and may be considered as potentially curative.

The results of long-term follow up in 72 APL patients were presented and prognostic factors discussed. METHODS: Seventy-two newly-diagnosed patients with APL entering CR with ATRA were consolidated with chemotherapy alone (31 patients), ATRA + chemotherapy (30 patients) and ATRA alone (11 patients). Univariate analysis was done to identify the potential prognostic factors. A total of 40 cases of patients relapsed after their first complete remission, including 3 groups of patients: group A, patients treated with ATRA and chemotherapy after relapse (8 patients); group B patients treated with As2O3 alone for 2nd CR and consolidation (21 patients); group C patients treated with As2O3 for 2nd CR and both As2O3 and chemotherapy for consolidation (11 patients). Univariate analysis was also done to identify the potential prognostic factors. RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 45 months (5-75 months), the median event-free survival was 21 months and median overall survival was not achieved. The estimated 3- and 5-year event-free survival (EFS) and over-all survival (OS) were 32.5 +/- 10.5%, 18.4 +/- 7.5% and 73.8 +/- 17.5%, 58.5 +/- 15.2%. In denovo patients, the combination of ATRA and chemotherapy in both induction and post-remission treatment was found to be statistically significant for EFS (P = 0.023), and initial peripheral leukocyte count was significantly related to OS. In relapsed patients, only the treatment of As2O3 with or without chemotherapy in consolidation after relapse was statistically significant for CR and both EFS (P = 0.0061) and OS (P = 0.0013). CONCLUSION: ATRA is an effective induction therapy and can be considered as first choice of treatment in denovo APL. Addition of chemotherapy in both induction and post-remission therapy can delay or decrease the possibility of relapse compared to ATRA alone. As2O3 is an effective agent for relapsed APL and remains an important prognostic factor for relapsed APL.","['Hu, J', 'Shen, Z', 'Sun, H', 'Wu, W', 'Li, X', 'Sun, G', 'Wang, Z']","['Hu J', 'Shen Z', 'Sun H', 'Wu W', 'Li X', 'Sun G', 'Wang Z']","['Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Department of Hematology, Rui Jin Hospital, Shanghai Second Medical University, Shanghai 200025.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],China,Chin Med J (Engl),Chinese medical journal,7513795,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', 'Oxides/therapeutic use', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tretinoin/therapeutic use']",2002/01/05 10:00,2002/01/31 10:01,['2002/01/05 10:00'],"['2002/01/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/31 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/05 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Chin Med J (Engl). 2000 Feb;113(2):107-10. doi: 10.3901/jme.2000.08.107.,,['10.3901/jme.2000.08.107 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The plasma variables were measured by ELISA or chromogenic study. The TF transcription was assessed using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction technique (RT-PCR). RESULTS: The blast cell procoagulant activity (PCA), TF antigen of APL cell lysates, as well as the transcription of APL TF mRNA elevated at diagnosis, were reduced after ATRA or As2O3 therapy. The plasma level of platelet alpha-granular membrane protein-140, soluble fibrinomonomer complex, thrombomodulin, tissue plasminogen activator and D-dimer significantly increased, fibrinogen, antigen level of protein C, plasminogen, alpha 2-plasminogen inhibitor and plasminogen activator inhibitor decreased at diagnosis, were restored to normal after complete remission but protein C activity and protein S remained elevated in ATRA group. CONCLUSIONS: There existed activation of platelets and consumption of anticoagulants as well as activation of coagulation and fibrinolytic system before treatment.

METHODS: A retroviral vector HaMDR expressing the human mdr1 gene was packaged by PA317 cells with a titer of up to 8.5 x 10(5) CFU/ml. K562 leukemia cells were infected with MDR retrovirus, and transfectant K562/MDR cells were generated. The integration and expression of the exogenous mdr1 gene in K562/MDR cells were determined by polymerase chain reaction and flow cytometry. The reversal ability of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) antagonists was analyzed by in vitro drug sensitivity, accumulation and efflux of rhodamine 123 (Rh123) in this model. RESULTS: Transduction with amphotropic MDR retrovirus resulted in integration and expression of the mdr1 gene in the resistant cells, where an aberrant splicing transcript of the mdr1 gene was found. The K562/MDR cells displayed a classic MDR phenotype with a 41-78 fold resistance to vincristine and colchicine in comparison with parental K562 cells. The drug sensitivity of K562/MDR cells to vincristine can be completely restored by cyclosporin A (CsA, 2 mg/L) and Cremophor EL (CRE 132 mg/L), either individually or in combination (P < 0.05). CsA (3 mg/L) can block the efflux pump function of P-gp shown by the significantly increased accumulation and efflux reduction of Rh123 in K562/MDR cells. CONCLUSIONS: Retroviral vector HaMDR allows transfection with high-level expression of the mdr1 gene in human myeloid progenitor cells K562. The transfected K562/MDR provides a simple, sensitive model for developing antagonists of P-gp and studying their mechanism of action.","['Fu, J', 'Chen, Z', 'Cen, J', 'Ruan, C']","['Fu J', 'Chen Z', 'Cen J', 'Ruan C']","['Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital, Suzhou Medical College, Suzhou 215006, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Chin Med J (Engl),Chinese medical journal,7513795,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '1N3CZ14C5O (Rhodamine 123)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)']",IM,,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Cyclosporine/pharmacology', '*Genes, MDR', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Rhodamine 123/metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Vincristine/pharmacology']",2002/01/05 10:00,2002/02/08 10:01,['2002/01/05 10:00'],"['2002/01/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/08 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/05 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Chin Med J (Engl). 2000 Mar;113(3):228-31.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Analyzing more than 460 human leukemia-lymphoma (LL) cell lines, we found that 28% of the cultures were mycoplasma-positive. Mycoplasmas can produce extensive changes, growth arrest and cell death in the infected cultures. While mycoplasma-infected cell lines can be truly cleansed from the contaminants, all the efforts would be in vain when the cells return to a mycoplasma-infested environment or are handled with unsuitable culture practices. Hence, the main focus of mycoplasma control should be on preventing cell culture contamination. Mycoplasmas can be introduced through several routes including culture reagents and laboratory personnel. Cross-contamination from infected cell cultures within one laboratory continues to be the major source for the spread of mycoplasma. Specific technical protocols and cell culturing guidelines may be followed in order to minimize the risk of mycoplasma contamination of cell lines. This ""good culture practice"" is of utmost importance as faulty cell culture techniques appear to be also the main reason for the high incidence of cross-contaminated LL cell lines which according to our experience using DNA fingerprinting of some 500 LL cell lines is about 15%.","['Uphoff, C C', 'Drexler, H G']","['Uphoff CC', 'Drexler HG']","['Department of Human and Animal Cell Cultures, Braunschweig, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Japan,Hum Cell,Human cell,8912329,,IM,,"['*Bacteriological Techniques', 'Cells, Cultured/*microbiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/microbiology', 'Lymphoma/microbiology', 'Mycoplasma Infections/microbiology/*prevention & control']",2002/01/05 10:00,2002/02/09 10:01,['2002/01/05 10:00'],"['2002/01/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/09 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/05 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Hum Cell. 2001 Sep;14(3):244-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The cells acquired resistance to antifolate drug(s) through: (1) impaired drug uptake via the reduced folate carrier, (2) increased activity of the target enzymes[dihydrofolate reductase(DHFR) or thymidylate synthase(TS)] resulted from a concomitant amplification and overexpression of their gene, (3) induction of a variant DHFR with a low affinity for antifolate drug(s) used for the selection of resistance, and (4) defective polyglutamation. Each resistance mechanism was not necessarily induced at random, but appeared to relate to the biochemical and pharmacological properties of the drug exposed, biological dispositions of the cells, drug-exposure manners to, or culture conditions of the cells. Since it has been shown that a minor modification at the specified position of the folate structure resulted in a drastic change in its pharmacological properties, many new compounds have been rationally designed on the basis of the knowledge of relationships between structure modifications and pharmacological properties. The step-by-step approach to the development of new analogues led to the discoveries of several promising antifolate drugs such as trimetrexate and raltitrexed, which can overcome the acquired and natural resistance to methotrexate, a classical antifolate, and clinical trials of these newer classes of antifolate compounds are currently underway.","['Takemura, Y', 'Kobayashi, H', 'Miyachi, H']","['Takemura Y', 'Kobayashi H', 'Miyachi H']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, National Defense Medical College, Tokai University School of Medicine. yutakemu@interlink.or.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Japan,Hum Cell,Human cell,8912329,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Folate Receptors, GPI-Anchored)', '0 (Folic Acid Antagonists)', '0 (Pteroylpolyglutamic Acids)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', 'EC 1.5.1.3 (Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 2.1.1.45 (Thymidylate Synthase)', 'EC 6.3.2.- (Peptide Synthases)', 'EC 6.3.2.17 (folylpolyglutamate synthetase)', 'UPN4ITI8T4 (Trimetrexate)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,,"['Carrier Proteins/genetics/metabolism', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics/physiology', 'Folate Receptors, GPI-Anchored', '*Folic Acid Antagonists', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics/metabolism', 'Methotrexate', 'Mutation', 'Peptide Synthases/metabolism', 'Pteroylpolyglutamic Acids/metabolism', '*Receptors, Cell Surface', 'Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase/genetics/metabolism', 'Thymidylate Synthase/genetics/metabolism', 'Trimetrexate', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/01/05 10:00,2002/02/09 10:01,['2002/01/05 10:00'],"['2002/01/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/09 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/05 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Hum Cell. 2001 Sep;14(3):185-202.,,,,128,,,,,,,,,,

P-gp is encoded by a group of related genes termed MDR; only MDR1 is known to confer the drug resistance, and its overexpression in cancer cells has been a therapeutic target to circumvent the resistance. To overcome P-gp-mediated drug resistance, we have developed six anti-MDR1 hammerhead ribozymes and delivered them to P-gp-overproducing human leukemia cell line by a retroviral vector containing RNA polymerase III promoter. These ribozyme-transduced cells became vincristine-sensitive, concomitant with the decreases in MDR1 expression, P-gp amount and efflux pump function. Among the ribozymes tested, the anti-MDR1 ribozyme against the translation-initiation site exhibited the highest efficacy. The retrovirus-mediated transfer of this most potent anti-MDR1 ribozyme into a human lymphoma cell line, which was made resistant by infection of pHaMDR1/A retroviral vector and thus possessed a low degree of MDR due to P-gp expression relevant to clinical MDR, resulted in a complete reversal of MDR phenotype. In addition to retrovirus-mediated transfer of ribozymes, we evaluated the efficacy of cationic liposome-mediated transfer of ribozyme. Treatment of a P-gp-producing human breast cancer cell line with the liposome-ribozyme complex resulted in reversal of resistance, concomitant with the decreases in both MDR1 expression and P-gp amount. Confocal microscopic imaging of the cells after treatment with liposome/FITC-dextran showed cytoplasmic fluorescence that was abolished by cytochalasin B, indicating a high endocytotic activity in these cells. The endocytotic activity was well correlated with the success of cationic liposome-mediated transfer of MDR1 ribozyme. These distinct approaches using either retrovirus- or liposome-mediated transfer of anti-MDR1 ribozyme may be selectively applicable to the treatment of MDR cells with different properties such as endocytotic activity as a specific means to reverse resistance.","['Kobayashi, H', 'Takemura, Y', 'Miyachi, H']","['Kobayashi H', 'Takemura Y', 'Miyachi H']","['Department of Pharmacology, Tokai University School of Medicine. hkobayas@is.icc.u-tokai.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Japan,Hum Cell,Human cell,8912329,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Liposomes)', '0 (RNA, Catalytic)', '0 (hammerhead ribozyme)']",IM,,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/physiology', 'Animals', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genes, MDR', '*Genetic Therapy', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Liposomes', 'Neoplasms/genetics/therapy', 'RNA, Catalytic/genetics', 'Retroviridae', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/01/05 10:00,2002/02/09 10:01,['2002/01/05 10:00'],"['2002/01/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/09 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/05 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Hum Cell. 2001 Sep;14(3):172-84.,,,,48,,,,,,,,,,

VEGF exerts its biologic activities through 2 transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptors: the fms-like tyrosine kinase receptor (Flt-1, or VEGFR1) and kinase insert domain-containing receptor (KDR or VEGFR2). We have previously produced a panel of antibodies directed against KDR from mice immunized with the recombinant form receptor. These antibodies efficiently neutralized VEGF-induced KDR activation and mitogenesis of human umbilical vascular endothelial cells (HUVEC). Murine antibodies, however, may not be suitable candidates for human therapy because of their propensity to elicit human anti-mouse antibody response. Here we isolated several high-affinity human Fab antibody fragments directed against KDR from an antibody phage display library constructed from the pooled B lymphocytes of nonimmunized healthy human donors. These human Fab fragments bind specifically to KDR with nanomolar affinity and block KDR/VEGF interaction with IC(50) of approximately 2-20 nM. Further, they effectively inhibit VEGF-stimulated mitogenesis of HUVEC and migration of human leukemia cells. Epitope mapping studies demonstrated that all neutralizing human antibodies bound the epitope(s) located within the first 3 N-terminal immunoglobulin-like domains of KDR, the same region that encompasses the binding site of VEGF. Our results suggest that these human anti-KDR antibodies may have potential application in the treatment of cancer and other diseases in which pathologic angiogenesis occurs.","['Lu, Dan', 'Jimenez, Xenia', 'Zhang, Haifan', 'Bohlen, Peter', 'Witte, Larry', 'Zhu, Zhenping']","['Lu D', 'Jimenez X', 'Zhang H', 'Bohlen P', 'Witte L', 'Zhu Z']","['Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, ImClone Systems Incorporated, 180 Varick Street, New York, NY 10014, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Angiogenesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Peptide Library)', '0 (Receptors, Growth Factor)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptors, Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor)']",IM,,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Angiogenesis Inhibitors/*chemistry', 'Antibodies/*chemistry', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Movement', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Endothelium, Vascular/cytology', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Epitope Mapping', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Neovascularization, Pathologic', 'Peptide Library', 'Protein Binding', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*immunology', 'Receptors, Growth Factor/*immunology', 'Receptors, Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Umbilical Veins/cytology']",2002/01/05 10:00,2002/01/25 10:01,['2002/01/05 10:00'],"['2002/01/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/25 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/05 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2002 Jan 20;97(3):393-9. doi: 10.1002/ijc.1634.,,"['10.1002/ijc.1634 [pii]', '10.1002/ijc.1634 [doi]']",,,,"['Copyright 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,

Less than 5% of these leukemia cells entered the cell cycle after activation, as indicated by the number of cells in G0/G1 phase. The protein tyrosine phosphorylation pattern and expression of the Bcl-2 protein were specific in ex vivo CLL cells of each individual patient. Expression of the p53 protein was not detectable in these leukemia cells. Cross-linking of the CD40/IL-4 receptors on CLL cells significantly upregulated phosphotyrosine proteins and the p53 protein. In the presence of chemical mixture, downregulated phosphotyrosine proteins were detected. Alterations in Bcl-2 expression were independent of cross-linking with CD40/IL-4 or chemical mixture. A high frequency of apoptotic cells was detected in cells that had downregulated phosphotyrosine proteins and Bcl-2 protein. There was no correlation between induction of apoptosis and expression of p53 protein. Our results suggest that apoptosis in resting leukemia cells could occur prior to the cell cycle progression.

The genetic factors underlying the susceptibility to this disease remain elusive. The enzymes CYP2E1, MPO and NQO1 are involved in the biotransformation of a variety of xenobiotics present in organic solvents, tobacco smoke, drugs, plastic derivatives and pesticides. They also control the level of the oxidative stress by catalyzing the formation of free radicals or by protecting cells from their deleterious effect. DNA variants in the corresponding genes have been associated with an increased susceptibility to different adult cancers, including hematologic malignancies. To investigate whether they represent risk-modifying factors in childhood ALL, we conducted a case-control study involving 174 patients and 337 controls, both of French-Canadian origin. We found that carriers of the CYP2E1*5 variant were at 2.8-fold higher risk of ALL (95%CI, 1.2-6.4) and that NQO1 alleles *2 and *3 contributed to the risk of ALL as well (OR = 1.7, 95%CI, 1.2-2.4). No such association was found with MPO alone. However, when the wild-type MPO allele was considered together with the CYP2E1 and NQO1 risk-elevating genotypes, the risk of ALL was increased further (OR = 5.4, 95%CI, 1.2-23.4) suggesting a combined effect.

Parental cells expressed low basal levels of the multidrug-resistance-associated gene (MRP1) and major vault protein (MVP) mRNAs and no MDR1 mRNA. Two doxorubicin-resistant cell lines were selected. Both drug-resistant cell lines upregulated the MVP mRNA level 1.5-fold within 1 cell passage. The MVP mRNA level continued to increase over time as the doxorubicin selection pressure was increased. MVP protein levels generally paralleled the mRNA levels. The 2 high molecular weight vault protein mRNAs were always expressed at constitutive levels. Fully formed vault particles consisting of the MVP, the 2 high molecular weight proteins and the vault RNA assembled and accumulated to increased levels in drug-selected cells. MVP induction is therefore the rate-limiting step for vault particle formation in U-937 cells. By passage 25 and thereafter, the selected cells were resistant to doxorubicin, etoposide, mitoxantrone and 5-fluorouracil by a pathway that was independent of MDR1, MRP1, MRP2 and breast cancer resistance protein. In summary, U-937 doxorubicin-selected cells are programmed to rapidly upregulate MVP mRNA levels, to accumulate vault particles and to become multidrug resistant.","['Hu, Yi', 'Stephen, Andrew G', 'Cao, Jin', 'Tanzer, Lee R', 'Slapak, Christopher A', 'Harrison, Steadman D', 'Devanarayan, Viswanath', 'Dantzig, Anne H', 'Starling, James J', 'Rome, Leonard H', 'Moore, Robert E']","['Hu Y', 'Stephen AG', 'Cao J', 'Tanzer LR', 'Slapak CA', 'Harrison SD', 'Devanarayan V', 'Dantzig AH', 'Starling JJ', 'Rome LH', 'Moore RE']","['Eli Lilly and Company, Department of Cancer Research, Lilly Corporate Center, drop code 0424, Indianapolis, IN 46285, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (ABCG2 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2)', '0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (MRP2 protein, S cerevisiae)', '0 (Mitochondrial Proteins)', '0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Ribosomal Proteins)', '0 (Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins)', '0 (Vault Ribonucleoprotein Particles)', '0 (major vault protein)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'Y49M64GZ4Q (multidrug resistance-associated protein 1)']",IM,,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/genetics/metabolism', 'ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2', 'ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/genetics/metabolism', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Cell Compartmentation', 'Doxorubicin/*pharmacology', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Heat-Shock Response', 'Hot Temperature', 'Humans', '*Mitochondrial Proteins', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins/genetics/metabolism', '*Neoplasm Proteins', 'Precipitin Tests', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'RNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Ribosomal Proteins/genetics/metabolism', '*Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins', 'U937 Cells/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Up-Regulation', 'Vault Ribonucleoprotein Particles/*biosynthesis/genetics']",2002/01/05 10:00,2002/01/23 10:01,['2002/01/05 10:00'],"['2002/01/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/23 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/05 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2002 Jan 10;97(2):149-56. doi: 10.1002/ijc.1590.,,"['10.1002/ijc.1590 [pii]', '10.1002/ijc.1590 [doi]']",,,,"['Copyright 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,

To further investigate whether platelets can be expected to adhere to and thereby affect AML blasts through their release of soluble mediators into a common microenvironment, we investigated (i) the effects on platelet activation by cytotoxic drugs commonly used in AML therapy; (ii) the occurrence of circulating activated platelets in acute leukemia patients; and (iii) the in vivo and in vitro adherence of platelets to AML blasts. The anthracyclins daunorubicin and idarubicin increased the expression of activation-associated membrane molecules (GPIIb/IIIa, CD62P, CD63) by normal platelets, daunorubicin then having the strongest effect. In contrast, cytarabine, epirubicin, doxorubicin and mitoxantrone had no significant effects. Although AML patients did not show increased levels of activated platelets in the circulation, adhesion of platelets to AML blasts was demonstrated both in vivo and in vitro.

The long terminal repeat (LTR) of this virus, like the LTRs present in FeLV proviruses from other cats with AML, contains an unusual structure in its U3 region upstream of the enhancer (URE) consisting of three tandem direct repeats of 47 bp. To test the disease potential and specificity of this unique FeLV LTR, we replaced the U3 region of the LTR of the erythroleukemia-inducing Friend murine leukemia virus (F-MuLV) with that of FeLV clone 33. When the resulting virus, F33V, was injected into newborn mice, almost all of the mice eventually developed hematopoietic malignancies, with a significant percentage being in the myeloid lineage. This is in contrast to mice injected with an F-MuLV recombinant containing the U3 region of another FeLV that lacks repetitive URE sequences, none of which developed myeloid malignancies. Examination of tumor proviruses from F33V-infected mice failed to detect any changes in FeLV U3 sequences other than that in the URE. Like F-MuLV-infected mice, those infected with the F-MuLV/FeLV recombinants were able to generate and replicate mink cell focus-inducing viruses. Our studies are consistent with the idea that the presence of repetitive sequences upstream of the enhancer in the LTR of FeLV may favor the activation of this promoter in myeloid cells and contribute to the development of malignancies in this hematopoietic lineage.","['Nishigaki, Kazuo', 'Hanson, Charlotte', 'Thompson, Delores', 'Yugawa, Takashi', 'Hisasue, Masaharu', 'Tsujimoto, Hajime', 'Ruscetti, Sandra']","['Nishigaki K', 'Hanson C', 'Thompson D', 'Yugawa T', 'Hisasue M', 'Tsujimoto H', 'Ruscetti S']","['Basic Research Laboratory, National Cancer Institute, Frederick, Maryland 21702-1201, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cats', 'Cell Line', 'Cloning, Molecular', '*DNA, Viral', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/*genetics/physiology', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/virology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/virology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/virology', 'Lymphoma/virology', 'Mice', 'Mink Cell Focus-Inducing Viruses/genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'Retroviridae', 'Retroviridae Infections/virology', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', '*Terminal Repeat Sequences', 'Tumor Virus Infections/virology']",2002/01/05 10:00,2002/02/13 10:01,['2002/01/05 10:00'],"['2002/01/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/13 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/05 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2002 Feb;76(3):1527-32. doi: 10.1128/jvi.76.3.1527-1532.2002.,,['10.1128/jvi.76.3.1527-1532.2002 [doi]'],,,,,,,PMC135779,['GENBANK/AB060732'],,,,

Here, we combined the beneficial characteristics of the LCMV glycoprotein (LCMV-GP) and those of retroviral vectors to generate a new, safe, and efficient gene transfer system. These LCMV-GP pseudotypes were systematically compared with vectors containing the widely used amphotropic murine leukemia virus envelope (A-MLVenv) or the vesicular stomatitis virus G protein (VSV-G). Production of LCMV-GP-pseudotyped oncoretroviral and lentiviral vectors by transient transfection resulted in vector titers similar to those with A-MLVenv or VSV-G. In contrast to A-MLVenv particles, LCMV-GP pseudotypes could be efficiently concentrated by ultracentrifugation without loss of vector titer. Unlike the cell-toxic VSV-G, a stable retroviral packaging cell line constitutively expressing LCMV-GP could be established. Vectors pseudotyped with LCMV-GP efficiently transduced many cell lines from different species and tissues relevant for gene therapy. Transduction of human glioma cells was studied in detail. These cells are a major target for cancer gene therapy and were transduced more efficiently with LCMV-GP-pseudotyped vectors than with the generally used A-MLVenv particles. The high stability, low toxicity, and broad host range make LCMV-GP-pseudotyped vectors attractive for gene transfer applications. The recombinant LCMV-GP-pseudotyped vectors will also allow functional characterization of naturally occurring and recombinant LCMV-GP variants.","['Beyer, Winfried R', 'Westphal, Manfred', 'Ostertag, Wolfram', 'von Laer, Dorothee']","['Beyer WR', 'Westphal M', 'Ostertag W', 'von Laer D']","['Heinrich-Pette-Institut fur Experimentelle Virologie und Immunologie an der Universitat Hamburg, Germany. beyer@hpi.uni-hamburg.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '0 (glycoprotein peptide, Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Viral/*genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'CHO Cells', 'Cats', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cricetinae', 'DNA, Viral', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genetic Vectors/genetics/*physiology', 'Glioma', 'Glycoproteins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Lentivirus/genetics/*physiology', 'Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Retroviridae/genetics/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Ultracentrifugation/methods', 'Viral Proteins/*genetics']",2002/01/05 10:00,2002/02/13 10:01,['2002/01/05 10:00'],"['2002/01/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/13 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/05 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2002 Feb;76(3):1488-95. doi: 10.1128/jvi.76.3.1488-1495.2002.,,['10.1128/jvi.76.3.1488-1495.2002 [doi]'],,,,,,,PMC135847,"['GENBANK/AJ328512', 'GENBANK/AJ328513', 'GENBANK/AJ328514', 'GENBANK/AJ328515']",,,,

Disruption of the G4 and p13(II) open reading frames interferes with viral spread in animal model systems, indicating that the corresponding proteins play a key role in viral replication. In addition, G4 is oncogenic in primary cell cultures and is absolutely required for efficient onset of leukemogenesis in sheep. To gain insight into the function of these proteins, we utilized the yeast two-hybrid system to identify protein partners of G4. Results revealed that G4 interacts with farnesyl pyrophosphate synthetase (FPPS), a protein involved in the mevalonate/squalene pathway and in synthesis of FPP, a substrate required for prenylation of Ras. The specificity of the interaction was verified by glutathione S-transferase (GST) pull-down assays and by coimmunoprecipitation experiments. Furthermore, confocal microscopy showed that the subcellular localization of G4 was profoundly affected by FPPS. The G4 protein itself was not prenylated, at least in rabbit reticulocyte lysate-based assays. The domain of G4 required for binding to FPPS was restricted to an amphipathic alpha-helix rich in arginine residues. Subtle mutation of this alpha-helix abrogated G4 oncogenic potential in vitro, providing a biological relevance for FPPS-G4 complex formation in cells. Finally, HTLV-1 p13(II) was also found to specifically interact with FPPS (in yeast as well as in GST pull-down assays) and to colocalize with G4 in mitochondria, suggesting a functional analogy between these oncoviral accessory proteins. Identification of FPPS as a molecular partner for p13(II) and G4 accessory proteins opens new prospects for treatment of retrovirus-induced leukemia.","['Lefebvre, Laurent', 'Vanderplasschen, Alain', 'Ciminale, Vincenzo', 'Heremans, Hubertine', 'Dangoisse, Olivier', 'Jauniaux, Jean-Claude', 'Toussaint, Jean-Francois', 'Zelnik, Vlado', 'Burny, Arsene', 'Kettmann, Richard', 'Willems, Luc']","['Lefebvre L', 'Vanderplasschen A', 'Ciminale V', 'Heremans H', 'Dangoisse O', 'Jauniaux JC', 'Toussaint JF', 'Zelnik V', 'Burny A', 'Kettmann R', 'Willems L']","['Faculty of Agronomy, Gembloux, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Ligands)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Viral)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)', '0 (g4 protein, Bovine leukemia virus)', '0 (rof protein, Human T-lymphotropic virus 1)', '94ZLA3W45F (Arginine)', 'EC 2.5.- (Alkyl and Aryl Transferases)', 'EC 2.5.1.10 (Geranyltranstransferase)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)']",IM,,"['Alkyl and Aryl Transferases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Arginine/metabolism', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Transport', 'Cattle', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', '*Genes, pX', 'Geranyltranstransferase', 'HeLa Cells', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/genetics/*metabolism', 'Ligands', 'Mitochondria/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oncogene Proteins, Viral/genetics/*metabolism', 'Retroviridae Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'ras Proteins/metabolism']",2002/01/05 10:00,2002/02/13 10:01,['2002/01/05 10:00'],"['2002/01/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/13 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/05 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2002 Feb;76(3):1400-14. doi: 10.1128/jvi.76.3.1400-1414.2002.,,['10.1128/jvi.76.3.1400-1414.2002 [doi]'],,,,,,,PMC135811,,,,,

So far, three randomized paclitaxel-based adjuvant clinical trials enrolling 3170 women (Cancer and Leukemia Group B [CALGB] 9344), 3060 women (National Surgical Adjuvant Project for Breast and Bowel Cancers [NSABP]-B28), and 524 women (M.

Given that the early promise of taxanes suggested by CALGB 9344 is not yet confirmed by the two other trials, only level 2 evidence has been reached to date in regard to a positive contribution of these agents to breast cancer outcome in the adjuvant setting. It is argued that level 1 evidence is highly desirable before adopting taxane-based regimens in standard practice. It is anticipated that a meta-analysis will be needed to comprehensively define the value of taxanes in early breast cancer, and a new model of international collaboration is proposed to find a balance between the need to offer new, more effective therapies to patients as soon as possible and the danger of drawing wrong, premature conclusions regarding the magnitude of benefit of a new regimen.","['Piccart, M J', 'Lohrisch, C', 'Duchateau, L', 'Buyse, M']","['Piccart MJ', 'Lohrisch C', 'Duchateau L', 'Buyse M']","['Jules Bordet Institute, 1 Rue Heger-Bordet, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium. martine.piccart@bordet.be']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Natl Cancer Inst Monogr,Journal of the National Cancer Institute.

Adjuvant chemotherapy has been shown to significantly reduce the annual risk of cancer recurrence and mortality, and these effects persist even 15 years after diagnosis. Combination chemotherapy is superior to single-agent therapy and anthracycline-containing regimens. Those that combine an anthracycline with 5-fluorouracil and cyclophosphamide are more effective than regimens without an anthracycline. Six cycles of a single regimen appear to provide optimal benefit. Dose reductions below the standard range are associated with inferior results. Dose increases that require growth factor or hematopoietic stem cell support are under investigation; at this time, the existing results provide no compelling reason to use this strategy outside a clinical trial. Regimens using fixed crossover designs with two non-cross-resistant regimens are being evaluated. The addition of a taxane to anthracycline-containing regimens is currently under intense scrutiny, and preliminary analysis of the first three clinical trials has shown encouraging, albeit not compelling, results. For patients with estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer, the sequential administration of chemotherapy and 5 years of tamoxifen therapy provides additive benefits. No compelling evidence exists to combine ovarian ablation with chemotherapy. Most side effects and toxic effects are self-limited, although premature menopause requires monitoring and preventive interventions to preserve bone mineral density. The small risk of acute leukemia is of concern, and additional research to develop safer regimens is clearly indicated. The overall effect of optimal local/regional treatment combined with an anthracycline-containing adjuvant chemotherapy and a taxane (and, for patients with estrogen receptor-positive tumors, 5 years of tamoxifen therapy) is a greater than 50% reduction in annual risks of recurrence of and death from breast cancer. For most patients at intermediate or high risk of cancer recurrence, the benefits of adjuvant chemotherapy exceed by far its unwanted effects.","['Hortobagyi, G N']",['Hortobagyi GN'],"['Department of Breast Medical Oncology, Box 424, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Blvd., Houston, TX 77030-4009, USA. ghortoba@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst Monogr,Journal of the National Cancer Institute.

Patients with unresectable and histologically confirmed malignant mesothelioma (MM) were eligible. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred five patients with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0 to 2 were enrolled onto the study. Thirty-seven percent of patients had not responded to prior chemotherapy. The primary end point of the study was survival. Tumor responses and time to progression were also assessed. The Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) prognostic group criteria were used to define a treatment target group (TTG). Both the intent-to-treat (ITT) and the TTG populations were analyzed for survival. RESULTS: Median survival times of 6 months for the ITT and 8.3 months for the TTG populations were observed. The 1- and 2-year survival rates were 34.3% and 21.6% for ITT, respectively, and 42% and 26.8% for TTG, respectively. Among the 81 patients assessable for tumor response, four had partial responses, two had minor regressions, and thirty-five experienced stabilization of previously progressive disease. Patients with responses and stable disease demonstrated markedly prolonged survival. Ranpirnase was well tolerated in the majority of patients, and there were no drug-related deaths. CONCLUSION: Ranpirnase demonstrated activity and a tolerable toxicity profile in patients with unresectable MM.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients from all risk groups, including infants and those with T-cell disease, were treated between 1987 and 1991. Standard-risk (SR) patients did not receive cranial irradiation, whereas high-risk (HR) and very high-risk (VHR) patients participated in a randomized comparison of 18 Gy of cranial irradiation conventionally fractionated versus two fractions per day (hyperfractionated). RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 9.2 years, the 9-year event-free survival (EFS +/- SE) was 75% +/- 2% for all 369 patients, 77% +/- 4% for the 142 SR patients, and 73% +/- 3% for the 227 HR/VHR patients (P =.37 comparing SR and HR/VHR). The CNS, with or without concomitant bone marrow involvement, was the first site of relapse in 19 (13%) of the 142 SR patients: 16 (20%) of 79 SR boys and three (5%) of 63 SR girls. This high incidence of relapses necessitated a recall of SR boys for additional therapy. CNS relapse occurred in only two (1%) of 227 HR and VHR patients. There were no outcome differences found among randomized treatment groups. Nine-year overall survival was 84% +/- 2% for the entire population, 93% +/- 2% for SR children, and 79% +/- 3% for HR and VHR children (P <.01 comparing SR and HR/VHR). CONCLUSION: A high overall survival outcome was obtained for SR patients despite the high risk of CNS relapse for SR boys, which was presumed to be associated with eliminating cranial radiation without intensifying systemic or intrathecal chemotherapy. For HR/VHR patients, inability to salvage after relapse (nearly all of which were in the bone marrow) remains a significant clinical problem.","['LeClerc, Jean Marie', 'Billett, Amy L', 'Gelber, Richard D', 'Dalton, Virginia', 'Tarbell, Nancy', 'Lipton, Jeffrey M', 'Barr, Ronald', 'Clavell, Luis A', 'Asselin, Barbara', 'Hurwitz, Craig', 'Schorin, Marshall', 'Lipshultz, Steven E', 'Declerck, Lieven', 'Silverman, Lewis B', 'Cohen, Harvey J', 'Sallan, Stephen E']","['LeClerc JM', 'Billett AL', 'Gelber RD', 'Dalton V', 'Tarbell N', 'Lipton JM', 'Barr R', 'Clavell LA', 'Asselin B', 'Hurwitz C', 'Schorin M', 'Lipshultz SE', 'Declerck L', 'Silverman LB', 'Cohen HJ', 'Sallan SE']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Hopital Sainte Justine, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Central Nervous System/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cranial Irradiation/*methods', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Dose Fractionation, Radiation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/mortality/pathology/*therapy', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Risk Factors', 'Salvage Therapy/adverse effects', 'Survival Rate']",2002/01/05 10:00,2002/02/02 10:01,['2002/01/05 10:00'],"['2002/01/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/02 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/05 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2002 Jan 1;20(1):237-46. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2002.20.1.237.,,['10.1200/JCO.2002.20.1.237 [doi]'],,,,,,"['CA 06515/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 68484/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,

In this population of patients, the question of whether treatment should then be withdrawn is not yet resolved. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In the present study, we followed 15 patients who stopped IFN after achieving CCR. In nine patients IFN was stopped in view of adverse reactions (n = 8) or patient's choice (n = 1). For the remaining six patients, the treatment was stopped because no BCR/ABL rearrangement could be detected by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in four successive analyses using peripheral-blood samples. RESULTS: Loss of CCR and survival were not statistically different (P =.48; P =.7) for the 15 patients who stopped IFN compared with 41 other CCR patients who continued IFN therapy in our institution. The median follow-up after discontinuation of IFN treatment was 36 months (range, 6 to 108 months). Seven patients (47%) (females, or CCR > 24 months and RT-PCR negative before IFN cessation; P <.0001) did not relapse. Eight other patients (53%) relapsed (lost CCR) within 3 to 33 months of treatment discontinuation. One of them relapsed in major cytogenetic remission (MCR) and was still in MCR 87 months after stopping therapy without any treatment. CONCLUSION: It is possible to stop IFN treatment at least in some patients with CML who achieve a prolonged period of CCR. This study also illustrates the hypothesis that persistence of low numbers of Ph-positive cells does not necessarily imply hematologic relapse.","['Mahon, F X', 'Delbrel, X', 'Cony-Makhoul, P', 'Faberes, C', 'Boiron, J M', 'Barthe, C', 'Bilhou-Nabera, C', 'Pigneux, A', 'Marit, G', 'Reiffers, J']","['Mahon FX', 'Delbrel X', 'Cony-Makhoul P', 'Faberes C', 'Boiron JM', 'Barthe C', 'Bilhou-Nabera C', 'Pigneux A', 'Marit G', 'Reiffers J']","['Service des Maladies du Sang, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Bordeaux, Bordeaux 2, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/blood/genetics', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Risk Factors', 'Statistics, Nonparametric', 'Survival Rate', 'Time Factors']",2002/01/05 10:00,2002/02/02 10:01,['2002/01/05 10:00'],"['2002/01/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/02 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/05 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2002 Jan 1;20(1):214-20. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2002.20.1.214.,,['10.1200/JCO.2002.20.1.214 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Seventy-six patients with T-PLL (including four chemotherapy-naive patients) received 3, 10, and 30 mg of Campath-1H on sequential days, followed by 30 mg three times weekly, as 2-hour intravenous infusions, for 4 to 12 weeks. RESULTS: Median patient age was 60 years (range, 35 to 84). Spleen liver, lymph node, and skin involvement were present in 64%, 40%, 54%, and 18% of patients, respectively. All tested patients had CD2, CD7, CD4, and/or CD8 positivity, whereas CD5 and CD3 were positive in 98% and 96% of tested patients, respectively. The objective response rate was 51% (95% confidence interval [CI], 40% to 63%), with a 39.5% complete response (CR) rate (95% CI, 28% to 51%). The median duration of CR was 8.7 months (range, 0.13+ to 44.4), and median time to progression was 4.5 months (range, 0.1 to 45.4) compared with 2.3 months (range, 0.2 to 28.1) after first-line chemotherapy. The median overall survival was 7.5 months (14.8 months for CR patients). The most common Campath-1H-related adverse events were acute reactions during or immediately after infusions. Fifteen infectious episodes occurred during treatment in 10 patients (13%), leading to treatment discontinuation in three. Eight patients experienced possibly related, late-onset infections. Severe thrombocytopenia and/or neutropenia occurred in six patients (8%), leading to treatment discontinuation in four. Two treatment-related deaths occurred. CONCLUSION: Campath-1H is an active drug in T-PLL patients for whom first-line therapy has failed. It has a favorable risk/benefit ratio and should be prospectively investigated in chemotherapy-naive patients.","['Keating, M J', 'Cazin, B', 'Coutre, S', 'Birhiray, R', 'Kovacsovics, T', 'Langer, W', 'Leber, B', 'Maughan, T', 'Rai, K', 'Tjonnfjord, G', 'Bekradda, M', 'Itzhaki, M', 'Herait, P']","['Keating MJ', 'Cazin B', 'Coutre S', 'Birhiray R', 'Kovacsovics T', 'Langer W', 'Leber B', 'Maughan T', 'Rai K', 'Tjonnfjord G', 'Bekradda M', 'Itzhaki M', 'Herait P']","['M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '3A189DH42V (Alemtuzumab)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Alemtuzumab', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Consumer Product Safety', 'Female', 'Hematologic Diseases/chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Opportunistic Infections/chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Salvage Therapy/*methods', 'Survival Rate', 'Time Factors']",2002/01/05 10:00,2002/02/02 10:01,['2002/01/05 10:00'],"['2002/01/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/02 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/05 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2002 Jan 1;20(1):205-13. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2002.20.1.205.,,['10.1200/JCO.2002.20.1.205 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Biopsy specimens from 26 patients were examined by histomorphologic and immunohistochemical analysis. Lymphomas were classified according to the Revised European-American Lymphoma Classification. Chromosomal imbalances were detected by high-resolution comparative genomic hybridization (CGH). Clinical data were obtained by retrospective evaluation of medical records. RESULTS: Chromosomal imbalances were detected in 0 of 6 patients with idiopathic orbital inflammation, 0 of 2 with benign reactive lymphoid hyperplasia, 3 of 3 with highly malignant diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, 4 of 10 with marginal zone B-cell lymphoma, 0 of 1 with chronic lymphatic leukemia lymphoma, and 1 of 4 with immunocytoma. Among the low-grade malignancies, chromosomal imbalances were seen in 1 of 9 at stage IAE, 2 of 3 at stage IIE, and 2 of 3 at stage IVE. Chromosomal imbalances were observed in all primary tumors from the five patients that later developed recurrent disease. In 14 of 23 imbalances with intrachromosomal breaks outside the centromere region, the breaks were present at bands with known fragile sites. No chromosomal imbalances specific for orbital presentation were detected. CONCLUSIONS: Chromosomal imbalances were seen mainly in orbital lymphomas that were either highly malignant or at an advanced stage. CGH analysis of orbital lymphomas could be prognostically relevant, but further studies are required to confirm this notion.","['Ness, Gro Oddveig', 'Lybaek, Helle', 'Arnes, Jarle', 'Rodahl, Eyvind']","['Ness GO', 'Lybaek H', 'Arnes J', 'Rodahl E']","['Center for Medical Genetics and Molecular Medicine, Haukeland University Hospital, Bergen, Norway.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci,Investigative ophthalmology & visual science,7703701,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Orbital Neoplasms/*genetics']",2002/01/05 10:00,2002/01/29 10:01,['2002/01/05 10:00'],"['2002/01/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/29 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/05 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci. 2002 Jan;43(1):9-14.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, CE of CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells and longevities of clones derived from them were also similar. Finally, CE and longevities of clones derived from a patient with chronic myelogenous leukaemia were found to be comparable as well.

Additionally, the CNTF alpha receptor is induced on astrocytes, establishing an autocrine/paracrine loop. How astrocyte function is altered as a result of CNTF stimulation remains incompletely characterized. Here, we demonstrate that direct injection of CNTF into the spinal cord increases GFAP expression and astroglial size and that primary cultures of spinal cord astrocytes treated with CNTF, IL-1beta, or leukemia inhibitory factor exhibit nuclear hypertrophy comparable to that observed in vivo. Using a coculture bioassay, we further demonstrate that CNTF treatment of astrocytes increases their ability to support ChAT(+) ventral spinal cord neurons (presumably motor neurons) more than twofold compared with untreated astrocytes. Also, the complexity of neurites was significantly increased in neurons cultured with CNTF-treated astrocytes compared with untreated astrocytes. RT-PCR analysis demonstrated that CNTF increased levels of FGF-2 and nerve growth factor (NGF) mRNA and that IL-1beta increased NGF and hepatocyte growth factor mRNA levels. Furthermore, both CNTF and IL-1beta stimulated the release of FGF-2 from cultured spinal cord astrocytes. These findings demonstrate that cytokine-activated astrocytes better support CNS neuron survival via the production of neurotrophic molecules. We also show that CNTF synergizes with FGF-2, but not epidermal growth factor, to promote DNA synthesis in spinal cord astrocyte cultures. The significance of these findings is discussed by presenting a new model depicting the sequential activation of astrocytes by cytokines and growth factors in the context of CNS injury and repair.","['Albrecht, Phillip J', 'Dahl, John P', 'Stoltzfus, Olivia K', 'Levenson, Robert', 'Levison, Steven W']","['Albrecht PJ', 'Dahl JP', 'Stoltzfus OK', 'Levenson R', 'Levison SW']","['Department of Neuroscience and Anatomy, Milton S.

A susceptibility gene may be located on the short arm of the chromosome 12. Among the genes in this region, the expression of the KRAS2 mRNA was increased in testicular cancer compared to the normal testicular tissue. By DNA typing, HLA-DR4 and 0405 allele in HLA-DRB1 showed high relative risk for testicular cancer. We analyzed the expression of the WT1 gene, reported to be a growth promoter for leukemia, by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR. Relative expression of the WT1 gene was significantly increased in high-stage cases than in low-stage cases, suggesting that WT1 could be useful as a tumor marker for progression of testicular cancers. Testicular germ cell tumors are usually very sensitive to chemotherapeutic agents such as cisplatin, and p53 has been reported to play an important role in chemosensitivity. Therefore, mutations of the p53 gene or other genes downstream may be responsible for their chemoresistance. The expression of the GML (GPI--anchored molecule like protein) gene was examined in testicular cancers. Its expression was not correlated with histology or stage. However, 4 refractory cases, 2 of which were recurrent cases from stage I and the others were at high stages, showed no expression of the GML mRNA. These interesting facts suggest that the expression of GML gene could be a good marker for the prognosis of testicular germ cell tumors.","['Nonomura, N', 'Okuyama, A']","['Nonomura N', 'Okuyama A']","['Department of Specific Organ Regulation (Urology), Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine.']",['jpn'],['Journal Article'],Japan,Hinyokika Kiyo,Hinyokika kiyo.

Reported success rates, defined mainly on the basis of improvement of preoperative symptoms, have been encouraging and ranged between 71 and 93%.

In this study, we present the outcome of FESS in our centre, where a second-look endoscopy was never performed. A retrospective study on all of the patients operated on between May 1987 and May 1997 was undertaken. All 35 patients had symptoms of sinusitis and had received initial medical therapy for at least 2 months. Only those who did not improve were considered candidates for surgery. Prior to the operation, all patients had computed tomography scan of the sinuses to document the extent of their disease. Eleven patients (31%) had asthma, 3 patients had cystic fibrosis, 1 had leukemia, 1 had immotile cilia, and 1 had Kartagener's syndrome. The period of follow-up ranged between 3 months and 5 years. Success was determined by resolution or improvement of the preoperative symptoms as assessed during their latest follow-up visit. Our data show an overall success rate of 74%. More than half of the patients (56%) who had recurrence of symptoms had an underlying systemic condition (cystic fibrosis, leukemia, or ciliary dyskinesia); however, these patients showed an initial improvement during the first few months following FESS. Also, five patients (14%) required revision FESS within 1 to 3 years following their initial surgery; four of those patients (80%) had an underlying systemic condition. Based on these results, we conclude that second-look endoscopy is of no benefit following routine FESS since our success rates are comparable to those reported in the literature.","['Fakhri, S', 'Manoukian, J J', 'Souaid, J P']","['Fakhri S', 'Manoukian JJ', 'Souaid JP']","[""Department of Otolaryngology, McGill University, Montreal Children's Hospital, Quebec.""]",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",Canada,J Otolaryngol,The Journal of otolaryngology,7610513,,IM,,"['Child', 'Chronic Disease', 'Endoscopy/*methods', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Postoperative Care/*methods', 'Recurrence', 'Reoperation', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Sinusitis/etiology/*surgery', 'Treatment Outcome']",2002/01/05 10:00,2002/05/01 10:01,['2002/01/05 10:00'],"['2002/01/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/05/01 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/05 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Otolaryngol. 2001 Feb;30(1):15-8. doi: 10.2310/7070.2001.21006.,,['10.2310/7070.2001.21006 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The intracellular locations of the autofluorescence emission and of the specific mitochondrial probe rhodamine 123 (R123) were matched. Under a 363 nm excitation, all spectra from K562 cells show equivalent profiles with a 455 nm maximum emission, near of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-(Phosphate) solution (NAD(P)H) (465 nm maximum emission). The spatial distribution of autofluorescence is homogeneous and different from the one of R123. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) (200 microM) and menadione (Men) (5 microM) induce a weak spectral change and a decrease in autofluorescence intensity, down to 40% of the initial emission. Doxorubicin (Dox) induces a dose-dependent decrease in autofluorescence emission and a release of intracellular free radicals. When cells were pre-treated 1 h with 1 mM glutathione (GSH), Dox induces a lower free radicals release, no significant variation of autofluorescence intensity and a lower growth inhibitory effect. Images cytometry of autofluorescence suggest that the intracellular NAD(P)H would not be restricted to mitochondrial compartments. The release of free radicals was associated with a decrease in autofluorescence intensity, mainly attributed to NAD(P)H oxidation both inside and outside mitochondria.","['Bondza-Kibangou, P', 'Millot, C', 'Dufer, J', 'Millot, J M']","['Bondza-Kibangou P', 'Millot C', 'Dufer J', 'Millot JM']","['Laboratoire de Physiologie Cellulaire & Hematologie, UFR de Pharmacie, IFR 53, Unite Median, CNRS FRE-2141, Reims, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Biol Cell,Biology of the cell,8108529,"['0 (Oxidants)', '53-59-8 (NADP)', '723JX6CXY5 (Vitamin K 3)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)']",IM,,"['Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Fluorescence', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/pharmacology', 'K562 Cells/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/metabolism', '*Microspectrophotometry', 'Mitochondria/chemistry', 'NADP/metabolism', 'Oxidants/pharmacology', '*Oxidative Stress', '*Spectrometry, Fluorescence', 'Vitamin K 3/pharmacology']",2002/01/05 10:00,2002/05/09 10:01,['2002/01/05 10:00'],"['2002/01/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/05/09 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/05 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biol Cell. 2001 Nov;93(5):273-80. doi: 10.1016/s0248-4900(01)01135-2.,,"['S0248-4900(01)01135-2 [pii]', '10.1016/s0248-4900(01)01135-2 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

We report that 2-CdA-induced IAP expression may be a possible mechanism whereby resistance to apoptosis is acquired in these cells. In WSU-CLL cells, three members of the Inhibitors of Apoptosis (IAP) family were identified. Bryo 1 treatment of WSU-CLL cells leads to initiation of the apoptotic cascade and induced a marginal increase in XIAP protein expression. In contrast, 2-CdA treatment, alone or in combination with bryo 1, induced a substantial increase in survivin and XIAP proteins and phosphorylation of BAD. Bryo 1 alone induced caspase-7 and -9 dependent [poly ADP-ribose] polymerase (PARP) cleavage, while sequential treatment with bryo 1 (72 h) followed by 2-CdA (24 h) induced caspase-3,-7, and -9 dependent PARP cleavage and increased apoptosis. Although exposure to bryo 1 initiated apoptotic events, apoptosis was first enhanced by 2-CdA, and then reversed in a time-dependent manner by 2-CdA-induced expression of survival proteins. Taken together, resistance to bryo 1/2-CdA treatment may be the result of 2-CdA-induced IAP inhibition of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway caspases.","['Wall, N R', 'Beck, F W', 'Al-Katib, A M', 'Mohammad, R M']","['Wall NR', 'Beck FW', 'Al-Katib AM', 'Mohammad RM']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Karmanos, Cancer Institute at Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, Ml, 48201, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,J Drug Target,Journal of drug targeting,9312476,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Bryostatins)', '0 (Deoxyadenosines)', '0 (Enzyme Activators)', '0 (Lactones)', '0 (Macrolides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '146-77-0 (2-Chloroadenosine)', '37O2X55Y9E (bryostatin 1)', ""JYW18Y92UP (2-chloro-3'-deoxyadenosine)""]",IM,,"['2-Chloroadenosine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Aged', 'Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Bryostatins', 'Deoxyadenosines/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activators/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Lactones/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*metabolism', 'Macrolides', 'Male', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*biosynthesis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein']",2002/01/05 10:00,2002/05/29 10:01,['2002/01/05 10:00'],"['2002/01/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/05/29 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/05 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Drug Target. 2001;9(5):329-39. doi: 10.3109/10611860108998769.,,['10.3109/10611860108998769 [doi]'],,,,,,"['CA79837/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA22453-20/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,

Hence, cytokine deregulation is likely to participate in the development or evolution of the malignant process. Over the last few years, endogenous cytokine levels have been correlated with phenotypic manifestations of cancer and with prognosis. For instance, serum IL-6 levels are elevated in both relapsed and newly-diagnosed Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and these levels correlate with established prognostic features. Furthermore, in diffuse large cell lymphoma, serum IL-6 level is an independent prognostic variable for both complete remission and failure-free survival. Serum IL-10 levels are also elevated in lymphoid malignancies and predict outcome. In some cases, it may be that the balance between endogenous cytokine agonists and antagonists is disrupted. For instance, in chronic myelogenous leukemia, high cellular (leukocyte) levels of IL-1 beta and low levels of IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA) are seen in advanced disease and correlate with reduced survival. The molecular mechanisms underlying cytokine deregulation are now being investigated, with preliminary data suggesting heterogeneous genetic driving forces, including oncogene aberrations and viral infection.","['Kurzrock, R']",['Kurzrock R'],"['Department of Bioimmunotherapy, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030, USA. rkurzroc@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",France,Biomed Pharmacother,Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,8213295,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-6)']",IM,,"['Cytokines/*metabolism', 'Homeostasis/physiology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/metabolism', 'Lymphoma/metabolism/pathology', 'Neoplasms/*metabolism/pathology']",2002/01/05 10:00,2002/05/25 10:01,['2002/01/05 10:00'],"['2002/01/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/05/25 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/05 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biomed Pharmacother. 2001 Nov;55(9-10):543-7. doi: 10.1016/s0753-3322(01)00140-8.,,"['S0753-3322(01)00140-8 [pii]', '10.1016/s0753-3322(01)00140-8 [doi]']",,41,,,,,,,,,,

It was enriched in 1959 with vincristine and cyclophosphamide and, in 1970, with daunomycin. It induced more and more apparently what were called complete remissions, and prolonged more and more the survivals without reducing however, until 1973, the (100%) mortality. It started to reduce it at the fifth year, to 20 and even 40% between 1973 and 1976, due to progressive and maximal intensification and duration of chemotherapy. It is in the same period that we proposed to apply in ALL remissions after relapses and in the first remissions of the most malignant type, allogeneic bone marrow grafts; we published the first success in human ALL in 1963, and clinically observed the same actions as those described experimentally: cytoablation of both leukemia and hematopoiesis, the latter being restored by the graft, whose reaction versus the residual neoplastic cells (called graft versus leukemia or GvL) appeared to be able to often eradicate them, at the cost however of a graft-versus-host reaction (both reactions sharing the same mechanism). One of us became a member of the Committee of the International Bone Marrow Transplant Registry, whose results showed the improvement in the prognosis of the aggressive form of ALL. The intensity and length established for chemotherapy for the most severe form of children's ALL have often been applied to the intermediary and to the least aggressive ones. The global 5-year survival increased to 60% between 1976 and 1984, and is around 80% today. But the registration of late debilitating or malignant effects of chemotherapy toxicities makes us wonder if some patients have not received an excessively intense and long application of cytostatics (often combined with ionizing radiations on CNS). In fact, the patients belonging to some HLA phenotypes (A33 and B17) have appeared to be especially often cured with active immunotherapy (killed leukemic cells and/or BCG), whose action was shown by specific cytotoxicity amplification, which was applied after short adjuvant chemotherapy, and hence is able to reduce the long chemotherapy incidence of debilitating or malignant late effects. Sakurai's group confirmed our absence of late relapses after ALL active immunotherapy, which contrasts with their risk after maintenance chemotherapy, whose minimal residual disease is a worrisome stumbling block to the cure.","['Mathe, G', 'Amiel, J L']","['Mathe G', 'Amiel JL']","[""Institut de Cancerologie et d'Immunologie & Hopital Suisse de Paris, Issy les Moulineaux, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",France,Biomed Pharmacother,Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,8213295,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Chronic Disease', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', '*Immunotherapy, Active/adverse effects', '*Immunotherapy, Adoptive/adverse effects', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/drug therapy/*therapy', 'Prognosis']",2002/01/05 10:00,2002/05/25 10:01,['2002/01/05 10:00'],"['2002/01/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/05/25 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/05 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biomed Pharmacother. 2001 Nov;55(9-10):531-42. doi: 10.1016/s0753-3322(01)00138-x.,,"['S0753-3322(01)00138-X [pii]', '10.1016/s0753-3322(01)00138-x [doi]']",,89,,,,,,,,,,

It has become apparent that there is diversity in types of CLL including those patients that do or do not have hyper-mutation of their immunoglobulin genes. Mutated genes confer a favorable prognosis. One of the major advances in our therapy has been the discovery of the activity of purine analogs, which have been demonstrated to be more active than conventional therapy in achieving complete remission, prolonged remission duration, and a suggestion of improved survival. More recently, based on information that purine analogs inhibit DNA repair, rational combinations have been developed. In particular, fludarabine plus cyclophosphamide appeared to have added activity compared to either drug given alone or in sequence. This has led to a higher response rate, longer time to progression, and an improvement in survival in patients treated following prior alkylating agents. Two monoclonal antibodies, Rituximab and Campath-1H, have become available for clinical use and research. Rituximab has modest activity as a single agent, with higher response rates being noted in patients who receive more intensive regimens. Rituximab has been successfully combined with chemotherapy, and in association with fludarabine plus cyclophosphamide (FCR) has a very high response rate and the ability to obtain polymerase chain reaction (PCR) negativity for the immunoglobulin heavy chain region. Campath-1H is very active as a single agent and is being recommended for treatment for patients with fludarabine refractory disease and will receive increased attention as a research agent in earlier-stage patients. Autologous and allogeneic bone marrow transplantation have emerged as significant treatments in CLL. The ability to achieve responses in bone marrow and peripheral blood with newer regimens has given the opportunity to collect stem cells from patients. There is a suggestion that intensification of remissions with autologous transplant can lead to PCR negativity and prolonged remissions. Allogeneic transplantation has been demonstrated to be effective with a strong suggestion of graph versus leukemia effect. This has been utilized in the development of non-ablative marrow allogenaic bone marrow transplant programs. Non-ablative transplants appear to be as effective as ablative transplants in the most recent analysis. Thus, multiple modalities have been brought together to achieve high-quality complete remissions in CLL, giving the prospect of improved survival.","['Keating, M J']",['Keating MJ'],"['The University of Texas M.

METHODS: Data from medical records of AML patients in our hospital in 7 year were analyzed with SPSS 8.0 system software. RESULTS: One hundred and ninety one untreated de novo AML patients received different induction chemotherapy regimens: HA, DA, AA and HAD. The complete remission (CR) rate was 81.4%, 89.9% for one to two courses. The median disease free survival (DFS) in 144 CR patients whose survival time could be analyzed was 9.6 months. The probability of survival was 21.6% at 3 year and 12.9% at 5 year. For the patients received less than 6 courses of post-remission therapy, the median DFS was 7.1 months and the probability of survival was 11.4% at 3 year and 6.3% at 5 years, Whereas for patients received 6 or more courses of post-remission therapy, they were 35.3 months, 43.2% and 27.0%, respectively. The differences between the two groups were statistically significant. For patients received 8 or more courses of post-remission therapy, the median DFS was 48.8 months and the probability of survival was 57.9% at 3 year and 31.6% at 5 year.

During the evolution, human beings have developed an effective defense mechanism. It was defined with functioning of: 1) skin and mucus membranes, 2) phagocyte cells and 3) humoral and cellular immunity. The patients with malignant hematological diseases are exposed to complex pathogenic processes that disturb their balance, which leads to the occurrence of an infective syndrome. METHODS: In the retrospective study of 422 patients with malign hematological disease, epidemiological-clinical analysis of the infectious syndrome has been carried out. Patients were hospitalized at the Clinic for Hematology--Clinical Center of Sarajevo University, in the period from January 1, 1993 to January 1, 2000. diagnostic protocol included the following procedures: anamnesis, clinical picture, biochemical, cytomorphological, pathohistological, microbiological and radiological test. The goal of work was to determine bacteriuria in case of malign hematological diseases as an accompanying, combined complication during the treatment of these patients. RESULTS: In case of patients that were hospitalized in 1994, bacteriuria was present in the percentage of 56, which is over expected trend line whereas in 2000 it was registered in 20.65% of patients had bacteriuria while 17% of patients had have infection, 28% of patients had bacteriuria while 17% of patients had other infections. In case of patients up to 65 age, bacteriuria was more frequent in female population while in the age of over 65 it was more frequent in male population. Through microbiological analysis of urinary flora, monomicrobial bacteriuria was found in case of 58% patients, and patients were mainly in the initial phase of disease. In case of patients with long treatment with antineoplastic drugs or in the phase of advanced basic process, bacteriurias with polymicrobial character were dominant, which is characteristic of recurrent infections of urinary tract. CONCLUSIONS: The authors came to the conclusion that it is necessary to monitor urine flora with malignant hematological disease patients and by using an adequate treatment to minimize initial infection, relapse and reinfection of urinary tract. Still, it is not clear which is the basic factor initiating the infection of urinary tract--whether it is the prevailing intensity and pathogenic aggressiveness of an agent, or the exposure intensity or a supportive condition of the patient.","['Dzirlo-Todorovic, J', 'Robovic, Z', 'Ceric, S', 'Vila, M', 'Sofo-Hafizovic, A']","['Dzirlo-Todorovic J', 'Robovic Z', 'Ceric S', 'Vila M', 'Sofo-Hafizovic A']","['Klinika za hematologiju, Klinicki centar Univerziteta u Sararajevu.']",['hrv'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Bosnia and Herzegovina,Med Arh,Medicinski arhiv,0400722,,IM,,"['Aged', 'Anemia, Aplastic/*complications', 'Bacteriuria/*complications/microbiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*complications', 'Lymphoma/*complications', 'Male', 'Multiple Myeloma/*complications', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Urinary Tract Infections/complications/diagnosis']",2002/01/05 10:00,2002/01/23 10:01,['2002/01/05 10:00'],"['2002/01/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/23 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/05 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Med Arh. 2001;55(4):247-50.,,,,,Ucestalost bakteriurije kod malignih hematoloskih oboljenja.,,,,,,,,,

We analyzed the presence of K-ras and p-53 point mutations in our patient with ALL and for the first time we had the opportunity to analyze the samples from two monozygotic twins. DNA was isolated from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNC) by the standard procedure, of the patient with ALL before and after bone marrow (BM) transplantation and of his clinically healthy twin brother. Samples were subjected to PCR amplification of K-ras exons 1 and 2 and p-53 exons 5, 6, 7 and 8. In PBMNC of the patient with ALL before BM transplantation, mutations were observed in exon 1 of K-ras and exon 8 of p-53 gene. These mutations were found neither in PBMNC sample of his twin brother, nor in PBMNC of the patient with ALL after BM transplantation. In the p-53 exons 5, 6 and 7 and exon 2 of K-ras, there were no mutations in any analyzed samples. Detected mutations in K-ras and p-53 genes could be a part of larger genetic abnormalities and the obtained results had shown the possibility of using DNA mutational changes in the follow-up of the success of BM transplantation. The molecular disease marker that was found by this method was also significant for the detection of minimal residual disease at the molecular level.","['Ilic, V', 'Cikota, B', 'Vojvodic, D', 'Malesevic, M', 'Stamatovic, D', 'Magic, Z']","['Ilic V', 'Cikota B', 'Vojvodic D', 'Malesevic M', 'Stamatovic D', 'Magic Z']",,['srp'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Serbia,Vojnosanit Pregl,Vojnosanitetski pregled,21530700R,,IM,,"['Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Diseases in Twins/genetics', 'Genes, p53/*genetics', 'Genes, ras/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Living Donors', 'Male', '*Point Mutation', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/therapy', 'Transplantation, Isogeneic']",2002/01/05 10:00,2002/01/23 10:01,['2002/01/05 10:00'],"['2002/01/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/23 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/05 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Vojnosanit Pregl. 2001 Sep-Oct;58(5):557-61.,,,,,Detekcija mutacija u K-ras i p-53 onkogenima kod obolelog od akutne limfoblastne leukemije pre i posle transplanticije kostine srzi.,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to present and evaluate the procedures used in a case-control study on leukaemia. METHODS: A series of 1,087 cases and matched controls were interviewed. Exposure assessments were performed for 13 occupational agents and ten leisure-time activities and the confidence of the assessments was coded. The exposure assessments were performed blind by three occupational hygienists. Ten percent of the interviews were reassessed by two of the three occupational hygienists. RESULTS: The leisure-time activities contributed to a large extent to the overall prevalence of exposure. For organic solvents approximately 25% of the controls classified as exposed would be misclassified if leisure-time exposure were not considered. The proportions of subject assessments with low confidence were higher for next-of-kin than for in-person interviews. A negative correlation was seen between the proportions of assessments with low confidence and the reliability. A significant difference was seen in the inter-rater comparison between cases and controls when the reliability was calculated for each assessed period; no difference was seen for the subject assessments used for relative risk estimation. CONCLUSION: When low-dose exposure in epidemiological studies are being assessed there is an obvious risk of misclassification if leisure-time activities are not included. Furthermore, the reliability of the assessments may suffer if next-of-kin interviews are used to a large extent. For cancers with poor prognoses, prospective studies are preferable to minimise possible information bias.","['Tinnerberg, H', 'Bjork, J', 'Welinder, H']","['Tinnerberg H', 'Bjork J', 'Welinder H']","['Department of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, Lund University Hospital, Sweden. hakan.tinnerberg@ymed.lu.se']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Int Arch Occup Environ Health,International archives of occupational and environmental health,7512134,,IM,,"['Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Leisure Activities', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*epidemiology', '*Occupational Exposure', 'Reproducibility of Results']",2002/01/05 10:00,2002/03/02 10:01,['2002/01/05 10:00'],"['2002/01/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/02 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/05 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int Arch Occup Environ Health. 2001 Oct;74(8):533-40. doi: 10.1007/s004200100265.,,['10.1007/s004200100265 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

In Caski, C4I, Flow 2002, and K562 cell lines, High-mobility group proteins I/Y were absent from nucleoli, whereas in HeLa cells they were present in this nuclear domain. Double immunolabeling studies showed that High-mobility group proteins I/Y co-localize with other key nuclear components such as NuMA, SC-35, and TAF(II)70. Nuclear reactivity for High-mobility group proteins I/Y dramatically decreased in apoptotic nuclei of HL-60 human leukemia cells. Our morphological data correlate well with previous biochemical and functional findings obtained by other investigators, who have demonstrated multiple roles for this class of polypeptides. However, they point to the likelihood that High-mobility group proteins I/Y are involved in as yet unidentified functions, most likely in the speckle domains of the nucleus.

Therefore treatment with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) may be used for prophylaxis against infections both with bacteria and Pneumocystis carinii in some departments. The use of TMP-SMX for prophylaxis during the induction therapy is not uniform in the four departments of pediatric oncology in Denmark. This gave us the opportunity to describe the effect of TMP/SMX on bacterial infections in children with ALL during the induction therapy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Between January 1st 1992 and December 31st 1997, 210 children were diagnosed with ALL in Denmark. Based on a retrospective review of the medical charts the number of children with fever (>38 degrees C), the number of febrile days, days of antibiotic treatment and the number of positive blood cultures were registered for every febrile episode. RESULTS: One hundred and fourteen children received TMP/SMX prophylaxis (10-30 mg/SMX/kg/day) and 76 did not. Children who received TMP/SMX prophylaxis had significantly fewer episodes of fever (66/114 (58%) v 60/76 (79%), p <0,01), and significantly fewer children who received TMP/SMX prophylaxis had positive blood cultures before start of antibiotic treatment compared with children who did not receive prophylaxis (23/114 (20%) vs 37/76 (49%), p<0.001)). Nineteen different species were isolated from the blood stream before start of antibiotic treatment. In the non-prophylaxis group there was a preponderance of isolates with Staph. aureus, Str. pneumoniae, E. coli and P. aeruginosa. There was no difference in the mortality between the two groups (p=0.44). There were no cases of P carinii pneumonia in the period of induction therapy. CONCLUSION: TMP/SMX prophylaxis during induction therapy for childhood ALL seems to reduce the risk of bacteremias and febrile illness.","['Schroder, H', 'Agger, K E', 'Rosthoj, S', 'Carlsen, N T', 'Schmiegelow, K']","['Schroder H', 'Agger KE', 'Rosthoj S', 'Carlsen NT', 'Schmiegelow K']","['Department of Pediatrics, University Hospital of Aarhus.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Denmark,Dan Med Bull,Danish medical bulletin,0066040,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '8064-90-2 (Trimethoprim, Sulfamethoxazole Drug Combination)']",IM,,"['Anti-Bacterial Agents/*therapeutic use', '*Antibiotic Prophylaxis', 'Bacteremia/microbiology/prevention & control', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Male', 'Opportunistic Infections/complications/prevention & control', 'Pneumocystis Infections/complications/microbiology/*prevention & control', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Trimethoprim, Sulfamethoxazole Drug Combination/*therapeutic use']",2002/01/05 10:00,2002/04/12 10:01,['2002/01/05 10:00'],"['2002/01/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/04/12 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/05 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Dan Med Bull. 2001 Nov;48(4):275-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The PTK inhibitor genistein (GEN) and PKC inhibitor staurosporine (STP) down-regulated Mcl-1 and Bcl-2 expression, and induced growth inhibition by blocking at the G2/M phase of cell cycle, followed by apoptosis, leading to chromatin condensation and DNA fragmentation. LY294002 (LY)-mediated inhibition of P13-K activity down-regulated Bcl-2 but not Mcl-1 expression. triggered growth arrest at the G1/G0 phase of cell cycle and also led to apoptosis marked with chromatin condensation and DNA fragmentation. The MEK inhibitor U0126 (U0) decreased Bcl-2 expression but not Mcl-1 expression, inhibited cells growth and induced G1/G0 arrest. but in this case cell death occurred without significant apoptotic features. The kinase inhibitor concentration dependence of cytotoxicity correlated well with down-regulation of Bcl-2 but not with changes in Mcl-1 levels. This suggests that Bcl-2 plays a predominant role in the regulation of cell death induced by cell signaling alterations whereas Mcl-1 does not appear to control cell survival under these conditions in MCF-7 cells. Further studies showed that the combination of GEN, STP and LY with U0 can produce synergetic cytotoxic effects on MCF-7 cells. Our results suggest that PTK, PKC, P13-K and MEK signaling pathways can regulate Bcl-2 expression and form an integrated network that plays a critical role in cell survival.","['Hu, Y', 'Dragowska, W H', 'Wallis, A', 'Duronio, V', 'Mayer, L']","['Hu Y', 'Dragowska WH', 'Wallis A', 'Duronio V', 'Mayer L']","['Department of Advanced Therapeutics, British Columbia Cancer Research Center, University of British Coluimbia, Vancouver Hospital, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Breast Cancer Res Treat,Breast cancer research and treatment,8111104,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Butadienes)', '0 (Chromones)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Morpholines)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (U 0126)', '31M2U1DVID (2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)', 'DH2M523P0H (Genistein)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)']",IM,,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Blotting, Western', 'Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy/enzymology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Butadienes/pharmacology', 'Chromones/pharmacology', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Genistein/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Morpholines/pharmacology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Nitriles/pharmacology', 'Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Protein Kinase C/antagonists & inhibitors', '*Protein Kinase Inhibitors', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Staurosporine/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/01/05 10:00,2002/08/29 10:01,['2002/01/05 10:00'],"['2002/01/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/29 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/05 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Breast Cancer Res Treat. 2001 Nov;70(1):11-20. doi: 10.1023/a:1012564620853.,,['10.1023/a:1012564620853 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

However, because of their many adverse effects (e.g. cardiotoxicity, leukopenia and alopecia), their clinical use has been limited. In order to minimize their adverse effects in clinical cancer chemotherapy, anthracyclines must be selectively transported into tumor cells. If there are differences in transport characteristics between tumor and normal cells, it should be possible to establish a strategy for selectively delivering anthracyclines to tumor cells on the basis of the differences. In human cultured leukemia HL60 cells, as tumor cells, and human fresh mononuclear cells, as normal cells, doxorubicin, pirarubicin, daunorubicin and idarubicin were incorporated via a common carrier-mediated system, but the carriers were different in the two cell types. In HL60 cells, it was indicated that a nucleoside transport system contributed, at least in part, to the transport of doxorubicin and pirarubicin, but not daunorubicin and idarubicin, and its contribution to pirarubicin transport was found in other tumor cells, i.e. mouse ovarian sarcoma M5076 and Ehrlich ascites carcinoma cells. On the other hand, in mononuclear cells, there was no involvement of a nucleoside transport system for the four anthracyclines examined. Therefore, we thought that with the modification of an anthracycline molecule as a substrate for the nucleoside transport system, the anthracycline could be delivered selectively to tumor cells.","['Nagasawa, K', 'Nagai, K', 'Ohnishi, N', 'Yokoyama, T', 'Fujimoto, S']","['Nagasawa K', 'Nagai K', 'Ohnishi N', 'Yokoyama T', 'Fujimoto S']","['Department of Environmental Biochemistry, Kyoto Pharmaceutical University, Japan. nagasawa@mb.kyoto-phu.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,Curr Drug Metab,Current drug metabolism,100960533,"['0 (Anthracyclines)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Anthracyclines/*metabolism', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/pharmacokinetics', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacokinetics', 'Biological Transport/*physiology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'HL-60 Cells/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/*drug effects', 'Treatment Outcome', '*Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/01/05 10:00,2002/07/27 10:01,['2002/01/05 10:00'],"['2002/01/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/07/27 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/05 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Curr Drug Metab. 2001 Dec;2(4):355-66. doi: 10.2174/1389200013338243.,,['10.2174/1389200013338243 [doi]'],,85,,,,,,,,,,

The new WHO classification].,429-43,"Except for chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), chronic myeloproliferative disorders (CMPDs) include as main subtypes polycythemia vera (PV), chronic idiopathic myelofibrosis (IMF), and essential thrombocythemia (ET). A common finding in CMPDs is a clonal evolution associated with a significantly variable course, which may be complicated by thrombocythemia, (secondary) myelofibrosis, and finally acceleration (unstable phase) that merges into blastic crisis. New therapeutic modalities (chemo- and interferon therapy, bone marrow and stem cell transplantation) which were developed in the last decade and the striking differences in survival amongst the different subtypes warrant not only an unequivocal distinction from reactive and allied disorders, but a clear-cut classification as well. For this reason, a synoptical approach is essential including clinical data and, as a major diagnostic tool, a bone marrow biopsy. This concept finds expression in the new WHO classification, which also includes as rare subtypes chronic neutrophilic leukemia, eosinophilic leukemia, chronic hypereosinophilic syndrome, and finally unclassifiable entities. Histopathology of bone marrow biopsies reveals specific findings, in particular concerning megakaryopoiesis, which are characteristic for the different subtypes. These features facilitate the still controversially discussed differentiation of thrombocythemia that is frequently present, as is the case in initial (prefibrotic) IMF from ET. Moreover, in addition to clinical findings,the associated heterogeneity of bone marrow morphology indicates a stepwise evolution of the disease process and thus exerts a significant impact on survival, i.e., in CML regarding erythropoiesis and myelofibrosis and in IMF extent of myeloid metaplasia.","['Thiele, J', 'Kvasnicka, H M']","['Thiele J', 'Kvasnicka HM']",['Zentrum fur Pathologie der Universitat zu Koln. j.thiele@uni-koeln.de'],['ger'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Germany,Pathologe,Der Pathologe,8006541,,IM,,"['Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/classification/pathology', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*classification/pathology', 'Polycythemia Vera/classification/pathology', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/classification/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Thrombocythemia, Essential/classification/pathology', '*World Health Organization']",2002/01/05 10:00,2002/01/26 10:01,['2002/01/05 10:00'],"['2002/01/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/26 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/05 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Pathologe. 2001 Nov;22(6):429-43. doi: 10.1007/s002920100492.,,['10.1007/s002920100492 [doi]'],,136,Chronische myeloproliferative Systemerkrankungen.

Dermatological abnormalities are often seen in patients receiving long-term HU therapy. Leg ulcers have been reported occasionally. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We carried out a prospective and descriptive study of patients who developed leg ulcers while receiving HU therapy. RESULTS: Between 1.1.1997 and 1.2.1998, chronic cutaneous leg ulcers were found in five out of a total of 28 patients treated with HU. The average age was 76 years (64-87 years). Two patients had chronic myelogenous leukaemia in a non-accelerated phase, two polycytaemia vera, and one essential thrombocytosis. The average duration of HU therapy was 30 months (10-55 months) before ulcerations appeared. These were typically located on the malleolar and/or perimalleolar area, and were very painful. HU therapy was discontinued and replaced by busulphan or anagrelide. Within 1.5-11 months of discontinuation of the treatment, the wounds had healed or improved. DISCUSSION: We found a surprisingly high number of cutaneous leg ulcers in patients on HU therapy for chronic myeloproliferative disorders. We believe this disabling complication should be given greater attention and recommend that it is included in the description of the side effects of the drug.","['Olesen, L H', 'Pedersen, B B']","['Olesen LH', 'Pedersen BB']","['Viborg-Kjellerup Sygehus, medicinsk afdeling.']",['dan'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Denmark,Ugeskr Laeger,Ugeskrift for laeger,0141730,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",IM,,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Drug Eruptions/*etiology/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Leg Ulcer/*chemically induced/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*drug therapy', 'Polycythemia Vera/drug therapy', 'Prospective Studies', 'Skin Ulcer/*chemically induced/pathology', 'Thrombocytosis/drug therapy', 'Time Factors']",2002/01/05 10:00,2002/02/02 10:01,['2002/01/05 10:00'],"['2002/01/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/02 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/05 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ugeskr Laeger. 2001 Dec 3;163(49):6908-11.,,,,,Hydroxyurea-inducerede underekstremitetsulcera hos patienter med kroniske myeloproliferative tilstande.,,,,,,,,,

Under some pathological conditions, it is invaded by leukocytes such as neutrophils, monocytes/macrophages and lymphocytes. Intercellular communication across these cell species is supposed to play crucial roles both in the brain functions and dysfunctions. However, the molecular basis of such intercellular communication remains unclear. We have studied the roles of cytokines and chemokines, which have been investigated as essential mediators in the immune and inflammatory systems, in intercellular communication across neurons, glial cells, endothelial cells and leukocytes. Messenger RNA expression of cytokines such as interleukin-1 beta was induced in brain microglia by i.p. injection of excitotoxin and neurostimulant, at least, partly via catecholaminergic systems. Messenger RNA of other cytokines such as leukemia inhibitory factor was induced in astrocytes. This cytokine specifically induced nociceptin mRNA in the cultured cortical neurons. Constitutive expression of some chemokines such as fractalkine and stromal cell derived factor-1 alpha was observed in the brain, suggesting that they play important roles in maintenance of brain homeostasis or determination of the patterning of neurons and/or glial cells in the developing and adult brains. Cytokines such as interleukin-1 beta and chemokines such as monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and macrophage inflammatory protein-1 alpha were produced in ischemic brain and implicated in ischemic brain injury. In addition to ischemia, cytokines, chemokines and their receptors have been shown to be involved in various neurodegenerative diseases such as multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease and AIDS dementia syndrome. They are potential targets for therapeutic intervention for neurodegenerative diseases.","['Minami, M']",['Minami M'],"['Department of Molecular Pharmacology, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kyoto University, 46-29 Yoshida, Shimoadachi-cho, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto 606-8501, Japan.']",['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Japan,Yakugaku Zasshi,Yakugaku zasshi : Journal of the Pharmaceutical Society of Japan,0413613,"['0 (CX3CL1 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CX3CL1)', '0 (Chemokines)', '0 (Chemokines, CX3C)', '0 (Cx3cl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Brain/*cytology/physiology', 'Brain Ischemia/genetics', 'Cell Communication/*physiology', 'Chemokine CX3CL1', 'Chemokines/*physiology', 'Chemokines, CX3C/genetics', 'Cytokines/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics', 'Mice', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis']",2002/01/05 10:00,2002/01/16 10:01,['2002/01/05 10:00'],"['2002/01/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/16 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/05 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Yakugaku Zasshi. 2001 Dec;121(12):875-85. doi: 10.1248/yakushi.121.875.,,['10.1248/yakushi.121.875 [doi]'],,76,,,,,,,,,,

Purification, based on a key step of affinity chromatography utilizing immobilized colominic acid, was greater than 1000-fold. The enzyme molecular weight determined by SDS-PAGE was estimated to be about 40 kDa, in good agreement with literature data. For the determination of the main kinetic parameters (Vmax and K(M)), fetuin turned out to be the unique substrate acceptor. In fact, other compounds such as asialofetuin, transferrin, alpha1-acid glycoprotein, and G(M3), routinely used to explore the different ST8 isoforms' activities, did not serve as substrate acceptors. In all cases, contrary to the routinely adopted protocol where a radioactive substrate donor is employed, for our purpose a non-radioactive, fluorescent substrate donor such as cytidine-5'-monophospho-9-(3-fluoresceinylthioureido)-9-deoxy-N-acetyl-neuraminic acid (CMP-9-fluoresceinyl-NeuAc) was used. Thus, under our experimental conditions, by using fetuin, data reported in a typical Lineweaver-Burk plot gave a Vmax value of about 4 nkatal/mg of protein and a K(M) value around 0.61 mM. Just as with the estimated molecular weight, these kinetic data were also in good agreement with those already reported for the ST8 purified from human neuroblastoma CHP-134 cells. In particular, in both cases, Vmax values were almost similar (4 nkatal/mg of protein for our ST8 purified from K562 cells and 4.35 nkatal/mg of protein for ST8 purified from CHP-134 cells); conversely, the K(M) value we found was about 3.25-fold lower than that found by Stoykova and Glick (0.61 mM vs. 2 mM). Then, although our purification was lower than that obtained by Stoykova and Glick (1080-fold vs. 2910-fold), the enzyme we purified showed a greater apparent affinity.","[""D'Andrea, G"", 'Di Ciccio, L', 'Brisdelli, F', ""D'Alessandro, A M"", 'Bozzi, A', 'Oratore, A']","[""D'Andrea G"", 'Di Ciccio L', 'Brisdelli F', ""D'Alessandro AM"", 'Bozzi A', 'Oratore A']","[""Department of Biomedical Sciences and Technologies, University of L'Aquila, Italy. gadan@cc.univaq.it""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Prep Biochem Biotechnol,Preparative biochemistry & biotechnology,9607037,"['0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (alpha-Fetoproteins)', 'EC 2.4.99.- (Sialyltransferases)', 'EC 2.4.99.1 (beta-D-galactoside alpha 2-6-sialyltransferase)']",IM,,"['Chromatography, Affinity/methods', 'Fluorescent Dyes/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/enzymology', 'Molecular Weight', 'Sialyltransferases/*isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Substrate Specificity', 'alpha-Fetoproteins/*metabolism']",2002/01/05 10:00,2002/05/09 10:01,['2002/01/05 10:00'],"['2002/01/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/05/09 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/05 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Prep Biochem Biotechnol. 2001 Nov;31(4):355-68. doi: 10.1081/PB-100107482.,,['10.1081/PB-100107482 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

In the case of APL, ATRA has been the drug of choice, and preclinical and clinical data support direct combinations of ATRA with cytotoxic chemotherapy. For neuroblastoma, a phase I study defined a dose of 13-cis-RA, which was tolerable in patients after myeloablative therapy, and a phase III trial that showed postconsolidation therapy with 13-cis-RA improved EFS for patients with high-risk neuroblastoma. Preclinical studies in neuroblastoma indicate that ATRA or 13-cis-RA can antagonize cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiation, so use of 13-cis-RA in neuroblastoma is limited to maintenance after completion of cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiation. A limitation on the antitumor benefit of ATRA in APL is the marked decrease in drug levels that occurs during therapy as a result of induction of drug metabolism, resulting in a shorter drug half-life and decreased plasma levels. Although early studies sought to overcome the pharmacologic limitations of ATRA therapy in APL, the demonstration that ATO is active against APL in RA-refractory patients has led to a focus on studies employing ATO. Use of 13-cis-RA in neuroblastoma has avoided the decreased plasma levels seen with ATRA. It is likely that recurrent disease seen during or after 13-cis-RA therapy in neuroblastoma is due to tumor cell resistance to retinoid-mediated differentiation induction. Studies in neuroblastoma cell lines resistant to 13-cis-RA and ATRA have shown that they can be sensitive, and in some cases collaterally hypersensitive, to the cytotoxic retinoid fenretinide. Fenretinide induces tumor cell cytotoxicity rather than differentiation, acts independently from RA receptors, and in initial phase I trials has been well tolerated. Clinical trials of fenretinide, alone and in combination with ceramide modulators, are in development.","['Reynolds, C P', 'Lemons, R S']","['Reynolds CP', 'Lemons RS']","[""Developmental Therapeutics Section, Division of Hematology-Oncology, Children's Hospital of Los Angeles, University of Southern California, Keck School of Medicine, Los Angeles, California, USA. preynolds@chla.usc.edu""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Hematol Oncol Clin North Am,Hematology/oncology clinics of North America,8709473,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoids)', '187EJ7QEXL (Fenretinide)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EH28UP18IF (Isotretinoin)']",IM,,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Fenretinide/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Isotretinoin/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Neuroblastoma/drug therapy', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/metabolism', 'Retinoids/*therapeutic use', 'Tretinoin/therapeutic use']",2002/01/05 10:00,2002/05/04 10:01,['2002/01/05 10:00'],"['2002/01/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/05/04 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/05 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Hematol Oncol Clin North Am. 2001 Oct;15(5):867-910. doi: 10.1016/s0889-8588(05)70256-2.,,"['S0889-8588(05)70256-2 [pii]', '10.1016/s0889-8588(05)70256-2 [doi]']",,283,,,,['CA81403/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,

While these reduced-intensity regimens have offered hope for patients with malignancies formerly not eligible for myeloablative transplantation due to excessive morbidity (older patients and patients with significant organ toxicity), the role of nonmyeloablative hematopoietic cell transplantation (NM-HCT) in children is unclear. A review of the available literature for pediatric and adult studies shows several malignancies in which approaches designed to limit long-term complications in children may be appropriate. In addition, NM-HCT may offer a safer approach for children with inherited disorders curable by marrow transplantation, such as immunodeficiencies, hemoglobinopathies, or storage diseases. Finally, use of this approach to establish partial donor chimerism may provide an immunologic platform that will allow specific cellular therapies, targeted gene therapy, or immunologic tolerance in solid organ transplantation.","['Pulsipher, M A', 'Woolfrey, A']","['Pulsipher MA', 'Woolfrey A']","['Department of Pediatrics, Division of Pediatric Blood and Marrow Transplantation, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA.

An empirical transition matrix for nonhomogeneous Markov chains has previously been developed, including a detailed statistical theory based on counting processes and martingales. In this article, we show how to estimate transition probabilities dependent on covariates. This technique may, e.g., be used for making estimates of individual prognosis in epidemiological or clinical studies. The covariates are included through nonparametric additive models on the transition intensities of the Markov chain. The additive model allows for estimation of covariate-dependent transition intensities, and again a detailed theory exists based on counting processes. The martingale setting now allows for a very natural combination of the empirical transition matrix and the additive model, resulting in estimates that can be expressed as stochastic integrals, and hence their properties are easily evaluated. Two medical examples will be given. In the first example, we study how the lung cancer mortality of uranium miners depends on smoking and radon exposure.

Moreover, a WBC count more than 30,000/microL (30 x 10(9)/L), atypical morphologic features, and CD38 expression in more than 30% of neoplastic cells (all adverse prognostic factors in B-CLL) were less common among IgD-only cases than among IgM+/IgD+ and IgD- cases. These data demonstrate that surface immunoglobulin heavy chain isotype expression is associated with several laboratory, morphologic, and immunophenotypic features in B-CLL.

In addition to histomorphologic examination, it is customary to use the absence of CD23 to differentiate MCL from CLL/SLL, based primarily on reported comparisons of immunohistochemical staining of tissue sections. These findings are widely extrapolated to flow cytometric analysis, although available data are contradictory and not sufficiently detailed. We compared expression of CD23 by flow cytometry in 22 cases of MCL and 25 cases of CLL/SLL. Lymphoma cells in 12 of 22 MCLs were negative for CD23, and 10 showed dim expression. In contrast, none of 25 CLL/SLLs were negative for CD23, 4 were dimly positive, and 21 were moderately or brightly positive. Thus, a significant proportion of MCL exhibited overlap of CD23 expression in the low-intensity range with CLL/SLL. Clinically, there was no correlation between the intensity of CD23 expression and clinical stage at diagnosis or survival. These findings emphasize that by flow cytometry, MCL can be differentiated reliably from CLL/SLL using CD23 if negative expression is observed. However, with dimly positive expression, interpretation should be cautious.","['Gong, J Z', 'Lagoo, A S', 'Peters, D', 'Horvatinovich, J', 'Benz, P', 'Buckley, P J']","['Gong JZ', 'Lagoo AS', 'Peters D', 'Horvatinovich J', 'Benz P', 'Buckley PJ']","['Department of Pathology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC 27710, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry/methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/chemistry/*diagnosis', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/chemistry/*diagnosis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptors, IgE/*analysis']",2002/01/05 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2002/01/05 10:00'],"['2002/01/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/05 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Clin Pathol. 2001 Dec;116(6):893-7. doi: 10.1309/UQ4N-M5KL-0ANY-YD3G.,,['10.1309/UQ4N-M5KL-0ANY-YD3G [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The nephrotoxicity is considered dose related and includes a variable reduction of glomerular filtration rate along with tubular dysfunction. SUBJECTIVE: The aims of the present study were: to analyse kidney damage as well as the clinical course in children treated for ALL, to determine what type of nephrotoxic damage is most frequent in relation with the used treatment, to determine possible risks of acute and chronic nephropathy of anticancer therapy, to standardise evaluation of kidney function in children after their complex antitumourous treatment has finished. METHODS AND MATERIAL: We examined a group of 36 children (21 boys, 15 girls, average age at diagnosis of ALL 6.9 years)) treated for ALL using the therapeutical protocol ALL BFM 90. The average period after the treatment had finished was 48 month. The following parameters were examined: urinalysis and urine sediment, clearance of creatinine, tubular resorption, ultrasound of kidneys, 24 hrs proteinuria (PU) and urine concentration of albumine, transferine, alpha-1-microglobuline and Tamm-Horsfall protein. Concentration function of kidneys was examined by test with DDAPV. RESULTS: After finish of cytostatic therapy had 19 patients (52.8%) PU. Glomerular PU was found in 3 children (15.8%), in 3 children (15.8%) was found mixed PU and 13 children (68.4%) had tubular PU. Reduction of GFR had 5 patients (13.9%) and 19 patients (52.8%) had reduction of DDAPV test. CONCLUSION: Sensitive laboratory analysis of proteinuria is required for timely detection of the most frequent type of kidney damage in the course of treatment with cytostatics but also other concurrently administered drugs. Thus we can reliably detect mainly patients with glomerular/mixed proteinuria who are potentially imperilled by the risk of the development of chronic renal failure. If there is higher level of glomerular/mixed proteinuria even after the treatment has finished, the patients have to undergo another nephrological monitoring.

Synthetic peptides were discovered. which were highly potent agonists at BB2 and extremely selective over both BB1 and BB3.","['Darker, J G', 'Brough, S J', 'Heath, J', 'Smart, D']","['Darker JG', 'Brough SJ', 'Heath J', 'Smart D']","['Discovery Research, GlaxoSmithKline, New Frontiers Science Park, Third Avenue, Harlow, Essex CM 19 5AW, UK. john_darker-1@gsk.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Pept Sci,Journal of peptide science : an official publication of the European Peptide Society,9506309,"['0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Receptor, Bradykinin B1)', '0 (Receptor, Bradykinin B2)', '0 (Receptors, Bombesin)', '0 (Receptors, Bradykinin)', '0 (bombesin receptor subtype 3)', '80043-53-4 (Gastrin-Releasing Peptide)', 'OF5P57N2ZX (Alanine)', 'PX9AZU7QPK (Bombesin)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,,"['Alanine/chemistry/metabolism', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Animals', 'Bombesin/chemistry/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Gastrin-Releasing Peptide/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Kidney/metabolism', 'Leukemia/pathology', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Oligopeptides/chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Receptor, Bradykinin B1', 'Receptor, Bradykinin B2', 'Receptors, Bombesin/*agonists/metabolism', 'Receptors, Bradykinin/*agonists/metabolism', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/01/05 10:00,2002/05/22 10:01,['2002/01/05 10:00'],"['2002/01/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/05/22 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/05 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Pept Sci. 2001 Nov;7(11):598-605. doi: 10.1002/psc.359.,,['10.1002/psc.359 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

In the differential diagnosis of lymphoma(s) of small lymphocytes (LSL), reliable detection of t(11;14) or t(14;18) would confirm the diagnosis of mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) or follicle center lymphoma (FCL), respectively. A total of 87 LSL cases (27 MCL, 39 FCL, 17 small lymphocytic lymphoma [SLL], 3 marginal zone lymphomas, and 1 paraimmunoblastic variant of SLL) were diagnosed by a combination of light microscopy, immunohistochemistry, and flow cytometric immunophenotyping. Interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for t(11;14) and t( 14;18) using dual-fusion probes (Vysis, Downers Grove, IL) was performed on touch (n = 69) or gravity (n = 18) preparations from these cases. Of 27 MCL cases tested, 25 (93%) had demonstrable t(11;14), none had t(14;18), and 2 were negative for t(11;14) and t(14;18). Twenty-five of 39 (64%) FCL cases had t(14;18), none had t(11;14), and the remaining FCL cases (14 cases [35%]) had neither t(11;14) nor t(14;18). All 17 (100%) SLL cases had neither t(11;14) nor t(14;18). All 3 (100%) marginal zone lymphoma cases had neither t(11;14) nor t(14;18). The case of paraimmunoblastic variant of SLL had t(11;14) and was negative for t(14;18). No discrepant [i.e., positive for both t(11;14) and t(14;18)] or false-positive cases were noted. Interphase FISH using these commercially available probes is a useful adjunct to light microscopy, immunohistochemistry, and flow cytometric immunophenotyping in the diagnosis of LSL. FISH can be performed successfully on archival single-cell preparations (touch preparations or gravity preparations) when fresh tissue is unavailable. No discordant or false-positive cases were identified.","['Frater, J L', 'Tsiftsakis, E K', 'Hsi, E D', 'Pettay, J', 'Tubbs, R R']","['Frater JL', 'Tsiftsakis EK', 'Hsi ED', 'Pettay J', 'Tubbs RR']","['Department of Clinical Pathology, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Ohio 44195, USA.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Diagn Mol Pathol,"Diagnostic molecular pathology : the American journal of surgical pathology, part B",9204924,"['0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,,"['*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 18', 'DNA Probes', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', '*In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/classification/*genetics/pathology', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Retrospective Studies', '*Translocation, Genetic']",2002/01/05 10:00,2002/05/03 10:01,['2002/01/05 10:00'],"['2002/01/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/05/03 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/05 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Diagn Mol Pathol. 2001 Dec;10(4):214-22. doi: 10.1097/00019606-200112000-00002.,,['10.1097/00019606-200112000-00002 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

SAMPLE POPULATION: Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues from 50 VSS and 50 cutaneous non-VSS. PROCEDURE: RNA was extracted from FFPE sections of each tumor, and regions of the long terminal repeat (LTR) and envelope (env) gene of enFeLV were amplified by use of reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The density of each RT-PCR product band for enFeLV was compared with that of a constitutively expressed gene, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). An integrated density value (IDV) was determined by use of densitometry, and the IDV ratio for enFeLV to GAPDH was calculated for each enFeLV primer set. RESULTS: The median (interquartile range) of the IDV ratio for the enFeLV LTR primer set was 0.52 (0.26 to 1.17) for the VSS group and 0.84 (0.21 to 1.53) for the non-VSS group. The median (interquartile range) of the IDV ratio for the enFeLV env primer set was 0.60 (0.37 to 0.91) for the VSS group and 0.59 (0.36 to 1.09) for the non-VSS group. CONCLUSIONS: Because the amount of enFeLV RNA within the LTR and env gene was not significantly different between the VSS and non-VSS groups, enFeLV replication or expression is unlikely to be involved in VSS development.","['Kidney, B A', 'Ellis, J A', 'Haines, D M', 'Jackson, M L']","['Kidney BA', 'Ellis JA', 'Haines DM', 'Jackson ML']","['Department of Veterinary Pathology, Western College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Vet Res,American journal of veterinary research,0375011,"['0 (RNA, Viral)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Cat Diseases/immunology/pathology/*virology', 'Cats', 'Densitometry', 'Electrophoresis, Agar Gel/veterinary', 'Fibrosarcoma/genetics/immunology/*veterinary/virology', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/chemistry/*genetics', 'RNA, Viral/genetics/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/veterinary', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Statistics, Nonparametric', 'Vaccination/adverse effects/*veterinary']",2002/01/05 10:00,2002/05/11 10:01,['2002/01/05 10:00'],"['2002/01/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/05/11 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/05 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Vet Res. 2001 Dec;62(12):1990-4. doi: 10.2460/ajvr.2001.62.1990.,,['10.2460/ajvr.2001.62.1990 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The compound was originally under development in collaboration with Triangle, which initiated its development in 1996 [227466], but later discontinued development of the compound [406677]. As of May 2001, UCSD's ongoing clinical trials of alanosine included phase II trials for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and phase I trials for acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL), while a phase II trial for glioma at UCSD had been suspended [408222]. Alanosine is an amino acid analog originally derived from Streptomyces alanosinicus. It interferes with the de novo synthesis of adenosine in both malignant and normal cells. In cancer cells that lack methyladenosine phosphorylase (MTAP, required in the salvage pathway), alanosine should deprive such cells (but not normal cells) of de novo synthesized adenosine [277968]. In early 1997, patients were being recruited for a phase II pilot efficacy trial of alanosine as a treatment for glioma and NSCLC, since a significant number of these tumor types lack MTAP and, it was hoped, would therefore be sensitive to alanosine [239280], [248260]. Phase I and II trials were completed in the 1980s by the NCI before they were discontinued because alanosine caused toxicity typically associated with chemotherapy, and did not produce significant response rates in common tumors such as breast or colon cancers. Researchers at UCSD found that some types of cancer lack MTAP, which was responsible for alanosine's previous clinical failure [227466]; phase II trials were being carried out at the university in 1997 [269338]. Triangle obtained an option for a worldwide license from the Regents of the University of California that expired in September 1998 (but had an option to extend the period for a further one year) [277968].","['Yu, J']",['Yu J'],"['Scripps Research Institute, Department of Molecular & Experimental Medicine, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA. johnyu@scripps.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Curr Opin Investig Drugs,"Current opinion in investigational drugs (London, England : 2000)",100965718,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '2CNI71214Y (alanosine)', 'OF5P57N2ZX (Alanine)']",IM,,"['Alanine/analogs & derivatives/chemistry/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/chemistry/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Humans']",2002/01/05 10:00,2002/05/08 10:01,['2002/01/05 10:00'],"['2002/01/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/05/08 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/05 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Curr Opin Investig Drugs. 2001 Nov;2(11):1623-30.,,,,50,,,,,,,,,,

Patients were trained to administer the antibiotic infusions themselves, via their central venous access device, according to a checklist and step-by-step instructions. Study-specific questionnaires were used to evaluate patient acceptance. Eleven patients [AL (n=8) and NHL (n=3), median age 51 years, range 29-661 participated in the education programme and subsequent OPAT during ten episodes of documented infection and six episodes of fever of unknown aetiology. All patients had assessment of the infectious episode and initial parenteral antibiotic therapy in the hospital before they continued self-administration at home. The median education time was 3 h (range 0.75-4.5). The patients could stay at home for 4 days (median, range; 1-12) with ongoing intravenous antibiotic therapy instead of being hospitalised. None of the patients developed recurrent fever. All patients reported that OPAT was of great value and they would favour OPAT again during subsequent antibiotic therapy. In conclusion, the results of this pilot series suggest that OPAT, in this setting, is a safe alternative during the last days of an episode of fever / infection. All patients were satisfied overall, and none was readmitted.","['Johansson, E', 'Bjorkholm, M', 'Wredling, R', 'Kalin, M', 'Engervall, P']","['Johansson E', 'Bjorkholm M', 'Wredling R', 'Kalin M', 'Engervall P']","['Department of Nursing, Karolinska Hospital and Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden. eva.m.johansson@ks.se']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Support Care Cancer,Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer,9302957,['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)'],IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Infusions, Parenteral', 'Length of Stay', 'Leukemia/complications/*drug therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/complications/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Outpatients', 'Pilot Projects', 'Self Administration/*psychology', 'Treatment Outcome']",2002/01/05 10:00,2002/02/23 10:01,['2002/01/05 10:00'],"['2002/01/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/23 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/05 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Support Care Cancer. 2001 Nov;9(8):619-24. doi: 10.1007/s005200100247.,,['10.1007/s005200100247 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Mortality from 12 major cancer sites, plus total cancer mortality at age 65-84 in 23 European countries, the US and Japan was analyzed. RESULTS: Between the late 1980s and the late 1990s total cancer mortality at age 65 to 84 has been declining in the European Union (UE) (-5.5% in males, -4.5% in females), in United States (US) males (-2.3%), but not females (+4.4%), and in Japanese females (-5.6%), but not males (+6.3%). Cancer mortality in the elderly rose for both sexes in eastern Europe. Gastric cancer mortality declined in all the areas. Lung cancer rates declined over the last decade by 8.5% in males in the EU. and by 0.9% in the US. Rates were still increasing in eastern Europe, in Japanese males and in females in all areas. Pancreatic mortality rates were increasing in both sexes in the EU and Japan up to the late 1980s, and in eastern Europe up to the 1990s, whereas rates for US males have been declining over recent years. Breast cancer mortality has declined over the last decade by 8% in the US and by 3% in the EU, while it has risen in eastern Europe and in Japan. Mortality from breast and prostate as well as ovarian cancer remained however low in elderly Japanese. Prostate cancer mortality declined in the EU and in the US, whereas it rose in eastern Europe and in Japan. Mortality from lymphomas and multiple myeloma rose in both sexes and various geographic areas, but improved diagnosis and certification may have played a role in these trends. Mortality from leukemia in the elderly increased in eastern Europe and Japan. but was stable in the US and the EU.

RESULTS: Of 37 cases, there were 25 females and 12 males in age range of 2 years to 75 years. There were three children. There were nine cases of refractory anaemia (RA), 18 of refractory anaemia with excess blasts (RAEB), nine of refractory anaemia with excess blasts in transformation (RAEB-t) and one of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML). All were denovo MDS. All patients had pallor. Hepato and/or splenomegaly was seen in 15 cases. Anemia, leukopenia and thrombocytopenia was seen in 37, 6 and 23 cases respectively. Bone marrow aspiration (BMA) was hyper to normo cellular in 35 cases. Dyshemopoiesis was seen in one or more cell lines in all cases. Bone marrow biopsy (BMB) was available in 16 cases. Abnormal localisation of immature precursors (ALIP) was seen in 11/12 biopsies of RAEB and 3/4 of RAEB-t.

In the following review we will discuss the clinical development and potential roles of monoclonal antibodies in the treatment of both acute and chronic leukemias.","['Cataland, S R', 'Lucas, M', 'Byrd, J C']","['Cataland SR', 'Lucas M', 'Byrd JC']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",Netherlands,Curr Pharm Biotechnol,Current pharmaceutical biotechnology,100960530,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)']",IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/therapeutic use', 'Chronic Disease', 'Humans', '*Immunotherapy', 'Leukemia/*therapy']",2002/01/05 10:00,2002/05/15 10:01,['2002/01/05 10:00'],"['2002/01/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/05/15 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/05 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Curr Pharm Biotechnol. 2001 Dec;2(4):357-67. doi: 10.2174/1389201013378608.,,['10.2174/1389201013378608 [doi]'],,44,,,,"['CA98099/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA81534-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 A91564-01A1/PHS HHS/United States']",,,,,,

In 1997, Rituxan (IDEC-C2B8, rituximab, MabThera) became the first MAb to be approved by the FDA for a cancer indication. Rituxan served to heighten interest in the therapeutic applications of MAbs. Herceptin (for patients with breast cancer) and Mylotarg (for patients with acute myeloid leukemia) were approved shortly thereafter. Literally dozens of antibodies are currently under investigation for a variety of malignant and non-neoplastic indications. Rituxan is effective in patients with low-grade or follicular, relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). The response rate and time to progression (responders) are in the 50% and 13 months range, respectively. It is also active in intermediate-grade NHL where a large randomized study, in combination with CHOP chemotherapy, has shown a statistically significant increase in complete response (CR) rate (75% vs. 60%), prolongation of 1 year event-free survival (69% vs. 49%) and of overall survival (83% vs. 68%) as compared to CHOP alone. This marks the first time that any agent has shown results superior to CHOP, the curative gold standard for this type of NHL. Other promising antibodies under clinical investigation include: Hu1D10; Anti CD19, 22, 52, and anti-Id antibodies. The safety profile, clinical activity, and mechanism of action of these MAbs make them ideal candidates for combination with chemotherapy or biologicals.

Neuroendocrine hormones may modulate lymphoid cell activities, including proliferation and mitogenesis, and immune cells may produce neuropeptides as well. Neuropetide Y is synthesized in B-cell leukaemia lymphoblasts, while substance P immunoreactivity has been detected in neoplastic haematological samples of different types of leukaemias. The presence of receptors for neuropeptides on different animal and human lymphoid cell lines, as well as in several types of animal and human lymphoproliferative diseases has been demonstrated. Species variability in receptor distribution has been shown as well. Receptor expression in immune cells may be regulated by changes in microenvironmental conditions, it may also be related to the activation and/ or proliferation state of cells. Vasoactive intestinal peptides receptors have been detected in myeloma cells, while somatostatin receptors have been first detected in vitro on resting lymphocytes and cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage, and later on human activated lymphocytes and on lymphoblastic leukaemia cells. Somatostatin receptors have been found in biopsies from patients with malignant lymphomas. Tumor localization in non-Hodgkin lymphomas and Hodgkin's disease can be visualized by in vivo somatostatin receptor scintigraphy, contributing to establish the diagnosis and the stage of the disease. Recently. somatostatin receptors have been in vivo and in vitro detected in human thymic tumors. Although treatment of lymphoproliferative diseases with somatostatin analogs is a little explored field, partial remission was found in patients with low-grade non-Hodgkin lymphoma and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, and a successful treatment with octreotide has been reported in patients with thymoma. Specific somatostatin receptors present in progenitors of immune cells are not expressed in the mature phenotype, while they can be detected in transformed cell lines. The possibility that this phenomenon is caused by oncogene expression cannot be ruled out. Moreover, preliminary data showed a developmental expression of somatostatin receptors in lymphoid cells, suggesting a potential role for neuropeptide receptors as differentiation markers. Although controlled studies are warranted to investigate the efficacy of the currently available analogs, somatostatinergic compounds may be of interest in the treatment of lymphoproliferative malignancies. A promising approach in refractory patients with somatostatin receptor positive malignant lymphomas may be radionuclide-targeted and cytotoxic analog therapy. These concepts increase the possibility of a wider antitumor treatment with ligands for neuroepeptide receptors than in established 'classic' neuroendocrine tumors.","['Ferone, D', 'Hofland, L J', 'Colao, A', 'Lamberts, S W', 'van Hagen, P M']","['Ferone D', 'Hofland LJ', 'Colao A', 'Lamberts SW', 'van Hagen PM']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Erasmus University, Rotterdam, The Netherlands. dferone@hotmail.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Ann Oncol,Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,9007735,"['0 (Neuropeptides)', '0 (Receptors, Neuropeptide)', '0 (Receptors, Somatostatin)']",IM,,"['Cell Differentiation', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Immune System/*physiology', 'Leukemia/*physiopathology', 'Lymphocytes/physiology', 'Lymphoma/*physiopathology', 'Neuropeptides/biosynthesis', 'Neurosecretory Systems/*physiology', 'Oncogenes/genetics', 'Receptors, Neuropeptide/biosynthesis/*physiology', 'Receptors, Somatostatin/*physiology']",2002/01/05 10:00,2002/03/27 10:01,['2002/01/05 10:00'],"['2002/01/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/27 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/05 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ann Oncol. 2001;12 Suppl 2:S125-30. doi: 10.1093/annonc/12.suppl_2.s125.,,"['10.1093/annonc/12.suppl_2.s125 [doi]', 'S0923-7534(19)54481-7 [pii]']",,74,,,,,,,,,,

Extensive analysis has been done to evaluate various chemical agents for the induction of endogenous retroviruses in murine and avian cells; however, similar studies have not been done with cells of other species, especially human and non-human primates, that are used in vaccine production. To develop a strategy for optimal induction and sensitive detection of endogenous, infectious retroviruses in currently used or potential vaccine cell substrates, we have initially investigated the use of a state-of-the-art, highly-sensitive, product-enhanced reverse transcriptase (PERT) assay for evaluating the kinetics of retrovirus induction and replication in 5-iododeoxyuridine (IdU)-treated K-BALB mouse cells, where endogenous retrovirus activation has previously been described. In general, the overall kinetics of virus production were similar to those of previous studies in that two peaks of RT activity were seen on long-term culture of IdU-treated K-BALB cells; however, retrovirus activation was detected earlier under our induction conditions and with greater sensitivity using the PERT assay, where 1-10 virions were detected in 1 microl equivalent of the test sample, without concentration. Furthermore, the PERT activity corresponded to the presence of infectious, murine leukaemia viruses (MuLVs) induced from K-BALB cells. Based upon these results, a strategy is proposed using the PERT assay for detection of inducible, endogenous retroviruses in vaccine cell substrates.","['Khan, A S', 'Sears, J F']","['Khan AS', 'Sears JF']","['Office of Vaccines Research and Review, Center for Biologics Evaluation and Review, U.

Direct PCR analyses of RNA obtained from tumour tissues from these macaques revealed the presence of several different recombinant murine leukaemia viruses (MuLV). Most prominent was a recombinant designated Mo(LTR)Ampho(env) in which the amphotropic env of the helper packaging virus was joined to a modified form of long terminal repeat (LTR) of the Moloney MuLV-derived vector that contained an additional copy of the core enhancer. This new LTR afforded enhanced replication upon the Mo(LTR)Ampho(env) MuLV in several different rhesus cell types compared with the prototype amphotropic MuLV4070A. Unexpectedly, at least two types of a mink cell focus-forming (MCF) MuLV element, arising from endogenous retroviral sequences expressed in the murine packaging cell line, were also transmitted and highly expressed in one of the macaques. Furthermore, murine virus-like VL-30 sequences were detected in the rhesus lymphomas, but these were not transcribed into RNA. The unanticipated presence of this array of MuLV-related structures in a primate gene transfer recipient highlighted the generation of recombinant retroviruses when the vector producer line produced replication competent viruses. These recombinants had an enhanced tropism and pathogenicity in the primate gene transfer recipients and frequently caused lymphomas. This primate experiment highlights the potential risk from contamination of a vaccine cell substrate with a replicating retrovirus.","['Purcell, D F']",['Purcell DF'],"['AIDS Cellular Biology Unit, Macfarlane Burnet Centre for Medical Research, Fairfield, Victoria, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Dev Biol (Basel),Developments in biologicals,100940058,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Viral Vaccines)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic', '*Immunosuppression Therapy', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Mice', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Retroviridae/genetics/*physiology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', '*Viral Vaccines', '*Virus Replication']",2002/01/05 10:00,2002/05/09 10:01,['2002/01/05 10:00'],"['2002/01/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/05/09 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/05 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,"Dev Biol (Basel). 2001;106:187-98; discussion 199, 253-63.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

VL30 endogenous retrovirus sequences were packaged in particles produced by the murine AM12 packaging system. For every seven MLV-derived -galactosidase beta-Gal vector genomes present in the particles, one copy of VL30 was also packaged. Although human FLY packaging cells expressed HERV transcripts (HERV-K, HuRT, type C, and RTVL-H), none was detectable in the MLV vector particles released from the cells. Non-specific packaging of the MLV gag-pol expression vector transcripts was detected in the FLY virions at a low level (one in 17,000 sequences). In other experiments, gag proteins produced by HERV-K particles present in human teratocarcinoma cells did not appear to package MLV-based vectors that expressed Gal transcripts.

However, natural killer (NK) T cells also have regulatory properties, and a role for NK T cells in suppression of GVH reactivity has not been completely excluded. NK cells may also contribute to the graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect associated with DLI therapy. In this study, we used a murine BMT model (C57BL/6 into AKR) to study whether depletion of donor NK cells had any impact on the suppression of GVH reactivity after DLI or on the DLI-induced GVL effect against acute T-cell leukemia. Depletion of donor NK cells was accomplished in vivo by giving DLI-treated bone marrow chimeras multiple injections of anti-NK1.1 monoclonal antibody (MoAb). The chimeras treated with anti-NK1.1 MoAb had significantly fewer splenic NK1.1 cells than nontreated chimeras, and splenocytes from anti-NK1.1-treated mice were deficient in the ability to generate lymphokine-activated lytic activity. Results presented here showed that NK-cell depletion had no effect on the suppression of GVH reactivity after DLI. When DLI-treated chimeras were challenged with an acute T-cell leukemia, NK-cell depletion had no discernible effect on GVL reactivity. These preclinical data suggest that donor NK cells do not have a significant role in the suppression of GVHD after DLI or in the mediation of GVL reactivity induced by DLI.","['Johnson, B D', 'Dagher, N', 'Stankowski, W C', 'Hanke, C A', 'Truitt, R L']","['Johnson BD', 'Dagher N', 'Stankowski WC', 'Hanke CA', 'Truitt RL']","['Department of Pediatrics, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Wisconsin 53226, USA. bjohnson@mcw.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/administration & dosage', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/methods/mortality', 'Graft Survival', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*prevention & control', '*Graft vs Leukemia Effect/*immunology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology/transplantation', 'Leukemia, Experimental/therapy', '*Leukocyte Transfusion', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Models, Animal', 'Survival Rate', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation Chimera']",2002/01/05 10:00,2002/07/26 10:01,['2002/01/05 10:00'],"['2002/01/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/07/26 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/05 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2001;7(11):589-95. doi: 10.1053/bbmt.2001.v7.pm11760146.,,"['S1083879101500300 [pii]', '10.1053/bbmt.2001.v7.pm11760146 [doi]']",,,,,,"['CA39854/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA71569/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,

GFPs with a different sequence from Aequorea victoria have recently been identified from Renilla mulleri and Ptilosarcus gurneyi. To examine these proteins as intracellular scaffolds for peptide display in human cells, we have determined the expression level of retrovirally delivered human codon-optimized versions in Jurkat-E acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells using fluorescence activated cell sorting and Western blots. Each wild type protein is expressed at 40% higher levels than A. victoria mutants optimized for maximum fluorescence. We have compared the secondary structure and stability of these GFPs with A. victoria GFP using circular dichroism (CD). All three GFPs essentially showed a perfect beta-strand conformation and their melting temperatures (Tm) are very similar, giving an experimental evidence of a similar overall structure. Folded Renilla GFP allows display of an influenza hemagglutinin epitope tag in several internal insertion sites, including one which is not permissive for such display in Aequorea GFP, giving greater flexibility in peptide display options. To test display of a functional peptide, we show that the SV-40 derived nuclear localization sequence PPKKKRKV, when inserted into two different potential loops, results in the complete localization of Renilla GFP to the nucleus of human A549 cells.","['Peelle, B', 'Gururaja, T L', 'Payan, D G', 'Anderson, D C']","['Peelle B', 'Gururaja TL', 'Payan DG', 'Anderson DC']","['Protein Chemistry Department, Rigel Pharmaceuticals, Inc., S.

CD8+ T lymphocytes are involved in the pathogenesis of GVHD but may not be essential for the graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect in CML. We have treated 26 CML patients with posttransplantation relapse with CD8-depleted DLI. Thirteen of 15 patients (87%) who relapsed in early-phase CML achieved complete cytogenetic response, but only 1 of 11 who relapsed in advanced-phase disease achieved complete response. Acute GVHD occurred in 2 patients (8%), and extensive chronic GVHD occurred in 2 patients (11%). Treatment-related mortality was 11.5%. Responses were durable; with a median follow-up of 4.2 years (1-7.5 years), only 1 responding patient relapsed (7%). CD8-depleted DLI was equally effective and safe after unrelated donor transplants and sibling transplants. Cytogenetic clonal evolution at the time of DLI was not predictive of treatment failure unless associated with hematologic criteria for disease acceleration. CD8 depletion is an effective method to separate GVL from GVHD for posttransplantation relapsed CML.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-five patients with low-grade lymphoma (48%), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (26%), or MCL (26%) underwent myeloablative allogeneic BMT from HLA-identical siblings at the Johns Hopkins Oncology Center. Patients had a median age of 46 years, a median of 2 prior treatments, and 31% were in complete remission at the time of transplantation. The preparative regimen was cyclophosphamide/total body irradiation for most patients. All grafts were T-cell depleted by counter flow centrifugal elutriation with CD34+ augmentation. RESULTS: The incidence of acute GVHD grade >2 was 6% and of grades 1 to 2 was 37%. The incidence of chronic GVHD was 6%. The median follow-up time was 25 months. The rate of event-free survival (EFS) was 50% (95% confidence interval [CI], 33%-66%). Only 1 patient relapsed. The transplantation-related mortality (TRM) was 46% for all patients. The TRM was 86% for patients with resistant disease and 14% for patients with sensitive disease and <2 prior treatments; rates of EFS were 0% (95% CI, 0%-0%) and 79% (95% CI, 47%-93%), respectively. CONCLUSION: These data show that, with T-cell depletion, the TRM and relapse rates are modest for patients with sensitive disease and <2 prior treatment courses. Thus, if there is a role for allogeneic BMT in the management of patients with these tumors, it is early in the course of the disease.","['Berdeja, J G', 'Jones, R J', 'Zahurak, M L', 'Piantadosi, S', 'Abrams, R A', 'Borowitz, M J', 'Vogelsang, G B', 'Noga, S J', 'Ambinder, R F', 'Flinn, I W']","['Berdeja JG', 'Jones RJ', 'Zahurak ML', 'Piantadosi S', 'Abrams RA', 'Borowitz MJ', 'Vogelsang GB', 'Noga SJ', 'Ambinder RF', 'Flinn IW']","['Department of Oncology, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,,IM,,"['Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/methods/*mortality', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/therapy', 'Lymphocyte Depletion', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/mortality/*therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Survival Rate', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",2002/01/05 10:00,2003/03/29 05:00,['2002/01/05 10:00'],"['2002/01/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/29 05:00 [medline]', '2002/01/05 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2001;7(10):561-7. doi: 10.1016/s1083-8791(01)70016-x.,,"['S108387910150004X [pii]', '10.1016/s1083-8791(01)70016-x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

A case report.,1601-6,"BACKGROUND: Fanconi's anemia is an autosomal recessive disease associated with chromosomal breakage as well as pancytopenia, skin pigmentation, renal hypoplasia, cardiac defects, microcephaly, congenital malformations of the skeleton, hypogonadism, and increased risk of leukemia. The present report describes the periodontal clinical and microbiological status of an 11-year old male having Fanconi's anemia. METHODS: Polymerase chain reaction analysis to detect human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), Epstein-Barr type 1 virus, and herpes simplex virus (HSV) was performed on paper-point samples pooled from either 3 periodontal sites with advanced attachment loss or 3 gingivitis sites with no clinical attachment loss. Anaerobic bacterial culture examination was performed on the pooled periodontitis sample. RESULTS: The patient suffered from pancytopenia, allergy, asthma, hearing impairment, and mental retardation. Dentition consisted of 7 primary teeth, 11 erupted permanent teeth, and 14 unerupted permanent teeth. Most erupted teeth showed severe gingival inflammation with some gingival overgrowth and various degrees of periodontal attachment loss. Genomes of HCMV and HSV were detected in the pooled periodontitis sample and HCMV in the pooled gingivitis sample. The periodontitis sample but not the gingivitis sample revealed HCMV mRNA of major capsid protein, suggestive of active viral infection. The periodontitis sample also yielded Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (1.1% of total isolates), FusobActerium species (7.9%), Campylobacter species (2.2%), Peptostreptococcus micros (3.4%), and Candida albicans (0.3%). CONCLUSIONS: Oral features of Fanconi's anemia may include increased susceptibility to periodontitis. It is likely that underlying host defense impairment coupled with periodontal infection by HCMV and A. actinomycetemcomitans contribute to the severe type of periodontitis associated with Fanconi's anemia.","['Nowzari, H', 'Jorgensen, M G', 'Ta, T T', 'Contreras, A', 'Slots, J']","['Nowzari H', 'Jorgensen MG', 'Ta TT', 'Contreras A', 'Slots J']","['University of Southern California School of Dentistry, Los Angeles, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Periodontol,Journal of periodontology,8000345,,IM,,"['Actinobacillus Infections/complications', 'Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans/growth & development', 'Campylobacter Infections/complications', 'Child', 'Cytomegalovirus Infections/complications', 'Epstein-Barr Virus Infections/complications', 'Fanconi Anemia/*complications', 'Fusobacterium Infections/complications', 'Gingivitis/virology', 'Gram-Positive Bacterial Infections/complications', 'Herpes Simplex/complications', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Peptostreptococcus', 'Periodontal Attachment Loss/virology', 'Periodontitis/*etiology/mortality/virology']",2002/01/05 10:00,2002/02/09 10:01,['2002/01/05 10:00'],"['2002/01/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/09 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/05 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Periodontol. 2001 Nov;72(11):1601-6. doi: 10.1902/jop.2001.72.11.1601.,,['10.1902/jop.2001.72.11.1601 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

We used HL-60 cells as a model of cancer cells to investigate whether acyclic carotenoids, such as phytoene, phytofluene, and zeta-carotene present in tomatoes, other than lycopene, as well as oxidation mixtures of these carotenoids, are potentially involved in the cancer-preventive action of tomatoes. When HL-60 cells were grown in the carotenoid-supplemented medium for 120 hours, zeta-carotene and phytofluene at 10 microM inhibited cell growth to 3.7% and 22.6% of the growth in control culture, respectively, although they were extremely unstable in the culture medium. The oxidation mixture of each carotenoid, which was prepared by incubation in toluene at 37 degrees C for 24 hours, more strongly inhibited cell growth than each intact carotenoid. The growth inhibition by lycopene was remarkably enhanced by its oxidation before supplementation to the medium. Phytofluene, zeta-carotene, and the oxidation mixture of lycopene induced apoptosis in HL-60 cells during incubation for 24 hours. The addition of alpha-tocopherol to the medium did not eliminate growth inhibition by the oxidation mixture of lycopene. These results suggest that the acyclic carotenoids inhibit cell growth through apoptosis induction and that oxidation products of the carotenoids participate in the growth inhibition.","['Nara, E', 'Hayashi, H', 'Kotake, M', 'Miyashita, K', 'Nagao, A']","['Nara E', 'Hayashi H', 'Kotake M', 'Miyashita K', 'Nagao A']","['Department of Bioresources Chemistry, Graduate School of Fisheries Science, Hokkaido University, Hokkaido 041-8611, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Nutr Cancer,Nutrition and cancer,7905040,"['0 (Anticarcinogenic Agents)', '0 (Culture Media)', '0 (zeta Carotene)', '36-88-4 (Carotenoids)', '3FPU23BG52 (Toluene)', '6NUO4W7YQ6 (phytofluene)', '87E4NJ6N51 ((all-E) phytoene)', 'H4N855PNZ1 (alpha-Tocopherol)', 'SB0N2N0WV6 (Lycopene)']",IM,,"['Anticarcinogenic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Carotenoids/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/*drug effects', 'Culture Media', 'Drug Stability', 'HL-60 Cells/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Lycopene', 'Lycopersicon esculentum/chemistry', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Toluene', 'alpha-Tocopherol/pharmacology', 'zeta Carotene/pharmacology']",2002/01/05 10:00,2002/05/01 10:01,['2002/01/05 10:00'],"['2002/01/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/05/01 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/05 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Nutr Cancer. 2001;39(2):273-83. doi: 10.1207/S15327914nc392_18.,,['10.1207/S15327914nc392_18 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: HLA class I antigens were investigated in 225 cases with various kinds of leukemia: 112 patients with acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML), 31 with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), 44 with chronic myelocytic leukemia (CML) and 38 with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Applying method of microlymphocytotoxicity, 13, 19 and 8 antisera were used for A, B and C loci respectively. Control group comprised 300 unrelated persons, whose phenotypic frequencies were used to calculate the relative risk (RR), while for values of RR greater than 1, we calculated etiologic fraction (EF), and for negative RR values we calculated preventive fraction (PF). RESULTS: Results of investigation showed that RR in AML was: for A2 = 1.144, for A3 = 1.038, for A29 = 1.814, for A34 = 2.69, for B7 = 1.06, for B14 = 1.74, for B17 = 1.65 and for B21 = 2.49 and B35 = 1.77 with value of chi 2 test of 4.62 and 4.63; that RR in ALL was: for A1 = 1.61, for A2 = 1.1, for A10 = 1.23, for A11 = 1.57, for A30 = 1.4, for A32 = 2.2, for B7 = 2.81 with value of chi 2 test 4.39; that RR in CML was: for A2 = 1.21, for A32 = 1.89, for B7 = 1.52, for B12 = 1.2 and for B15 = 3.28 with value of chi 2 test of 5.89; and that RR in CLL was: for A1 = 1.35 with value of chi 2 test of 3.973, RR for A2 = 1.02, for A28 = 1.97, for A32 = 1.25, for B5 = 1.44, for B8 = 1.27, for B13 = 1.91 without statistically significant differences of frequencies except for A1. Investigation of differences between haplotype frequencies among controls and patients showed statistically significant difference of A10 B40 haplotype in CML with RR value 7.24, while there were no statistically significant differences between controls and other leukemias. DISCUSSION: Our results of investigation showed statistically significant differences between HLA frequencies in the control group and investigated diseases, and that the relative risk is under 1, and values of chi 2 test under borderline values for B21 and B35 in AML, for B7 in ALL, for B15 in CML and for A1 in CLL. CONCLUSION: Results of this investigation point to an association between HLA system and leukemias. This association is of great importance because it provides a new tool for investigation of genetics and etiology of abovementioned diseases.","['Vojvodic, S', 'Belic, B', 'Popovic, S']","['Vojvodic S', 'Belic B', 'Popovic S']","['Zavod za transfuziju krvi Novi Sad, 21000 Novi Sad. vukuna@EUnet.yu']",['hrv'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Serbia,Med Pregl,Medicinski pregled,2985249R,['0 (HLA Antigens)'],IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Female', 'HLA Antigens/*analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/immunology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/immunology']",2002/01/05 10:00,2002/01/11 10:01,['2002/01/05 10:00'],"['2002/01/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/11 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/05 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Med Pregl. 2001 Mar-Apr;54(3-4):128-34.,,,,,Ispitivanje asocijacije HLA antigena i leukemija u populaciji Vojvodine.,,,,,,,,,

Since this protein modulates the anti-inflammatory actions of the steroid hormones, the purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of the female sex steroid hormone, 17beta-estradiol (E2beta), on the synthesis and secretion of ANXA1 in the human CCRF-CEM acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line. METHODS: Complementary reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and Western blot assays were performed to study the effect of E2beta on the expression of mRNA and protein ANXA1, respectively. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Treatment of CCRF-CEM cells with E2beta, for 30 min, stimulated the synthesis of ANXA1 mRNA molecules, and increased the cellular level of ANXA1 protein. Moreover, when the cells were incubated with E2beta under the same experimental conditions, a significant increase in the amount of ANXA1 secreted from the cells was also detected. ICI 182,780, a selective inhibitor of the intracellular estrogen receptor, had no effect on the E2beta-stimulated expression and externalisation of ANXA1. Taken together, these results indicate that E2beta induces de novo synthesis of ANXA1 and stimulates its secretion in the CCRF-CEM cell line, apparently through a mechanism independent of the intracellular estrogen receptor.","['Castro-Caldas, M', 'Duarte, C B', 'Carvalho, A R', 'Lopes, M C']","['Castro-Caldas M', 'Duarte CB', 'Carvalho AR', 'Lopes MC']","['Center for Neuroscience of Coimbra, Department of Zoology, University of Coimbra, 3004-517 Coimbra, Portugal.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mediators Inflamm,Mediators of inflammation,9209001,"['0 (Annexin A1)', '0 (Inflammation Mediators)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '4TI98Z838E (Estradiol)']",IM,,"['Annexin A1/*biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Estradiol/*pharmacology/physiology', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Inflammation Mediators/physiology', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/01/05 10:00,2002/06/04 10:01,['2002/01/05 10:00'],"['2002/01/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/06/04 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/05 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mediators Inflamm. 2001 Oct;10(5):245-51. doi: 10.1080/09629350120093713.,,['10.1080/09629350120093713 [doi]'],,,,,,,PMC1781720,,,,,

Specific adoptive immunotherapy without bone marrow transplantation might be more effective and less cost-intensive. Professional antigen-presenting cells, the dendritic cells, from patients with CML are derived from the malignant clone and may stimulate antileukemia T-cell responses. Autologous T cells may also be able to recognize tumor antigens on CML cells directly. Here, the authors show that CD4 and CD8 T-cell responses to autologous CML cells can be generated in vitro rapidly and effectively by performing modified autologous mixed lymphocyte/tumor cell cultures (MLTC) in serum-free medium in the presence of cytokines known to support dendritic cell differentiation. MLTC-sensitized T cells secreted large amounts of the type 1 cytokine interferon-gamma, as well as interleukin (IL)-2. However, they also secreted a variety of other cytokines, including the type 2-subtype cytokine IL-13 but not the classic type 2 cytokines IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10. Monoclonal populations of CML-specific CD4 cells could be derived from these lines in limited numbers but showed markedly enhanced reactivity. This suggests that CML-specific T cells are relatively rare in these autologous MTLC-derived sensitized populations, but that their isolation and propagation would yield much more potent antitumor effector cells for use in adoptive immunotherapy without the need for bone marrow transplantation.","['Muller, L', 'Provenzani, C', 'Pawelec, G']","['Muller L', 'Provenzani C', 'Pawelec G']","['Section for Transplantation Immunology, Second Department of Internal Medicine, University of Tubingen Medical School, Germany. ludmila.mueller@uni-tuebingen.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunother,"Journal of immunotherapy (Hagerstown, Md. : 1997)",9706083,['0 (Cytokines)'],IM,,"['CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/cytology/drug effects/*immunology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/cytology/drug effects/*immunology', 'Cell Division', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Cytokines/biosynthesis/*pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry/methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*immunology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/drug effects/immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/01/05 10:00,2002/05/15 10:01,['2002/01/05 10:00'],"['2002/01/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/05/15 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/05 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunother. 2001 Nov-Dec;24(6):482-92. doi: 10.1097/00002371-200111000-00005.,,['10.1097/00002371-200111000-00005 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

It was selected because of its strong reactivity on T lymphocytes on paraffin tissue sections. The anti-CD7 specificity of CBC.37 mAb was assessed by immunohistochemistry, cross-blocking, and cross-immunoprecipitation experiments using CBC.37 and the anti-CD7 mAb DK24. CBC.37 mAb immunoprecipitated a 40-kDa protein. Cross-blocking and cross-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that the two antibodies recognized the same molecule. Immunostaining of a large number of reactive lymph nodes and B and T cell lymphomas confirms that CBC.37 mAb was directed against T cells. As expected, on reactive lymph nodes the staining pattern was comparable to that of CD3. Among the 110 T cell lymphomas examined, all T lymphoblastic lymphomas were positive (15+/15; 100%). As a result of the frequent loss of CD7 antigen, only 25+/95 (26%) of peripheral T cell neoplasms were found to be positive for CBC.37. A marked reduction in the number of CBC.37-positive T cells was observed in 7 of the 60 cases of benign inflammatory dermatoses studied (approximately 12%). CBC.37 was unreactive with all healthy and neoplastic non-lymphoid samples examined. Because the lack of CD7 expression in T cell lymphomas is of diagnostic value, CBC.37 mAb in association with other anti-T cell antibodies working on paraffin sections could be of particular value in asserting the diagnosis of T cell lymphomas in routine histopathology.","['Al Saati, T', 'Alibaud, L', 'Lamant, L', 'Boyes, J', 'March, M', 'Delsol, G']","['Al Saati T', 'Alibaud L', 'Lamant L', 'Boyes J', 'March M', 'Delsol G']","['Department of Pathology and Unite de Physiopathologie Cellulaire et Moleculaire, CNRS-UPR 2163, CHU Purpan, Toulouse, France. alsaati@immgen.cnrs.fr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Appl Immunohistochem Mol Morphol,Applied immunohistochemistry & molecular morphology : AIMM,100888796,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD7)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)']",IM,,"['Animals', '*Antibodies, Monoclonal/biosynthesis/isolation & purification', 'Antigens, CD7/*immunology', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/immunology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Immunoassay', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/immunology/pathology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/immunology/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Paraffin Embedding/*methods', 'Precipitin Tests']",2002/01/05 10:00,2003/05/13 05:00,['2002/01/05 10:00'],"['2002/01/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/13 05:00 [medline]', '2002/01/05 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Appl Immunohistochem Mol Morphol. 2001 Dec;9(4):289-96. doi: 10.1097/00129039-200112000-00001.,,['10.1097/00129039-200112000-00001 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

In vitro production (in vitro maturation, in vitro fertilization, and in vitro culture) of viable porcine embryos is possible, although with much lower success rates than in cattle. The main problems are insufficient cytoplasmic maturation of porcine oocytes, a high proportion of polyspermic fertilization and a low proportion of blastocysts that, in addition, are characterized by a low number of cells, hampering their development in vivo upon transfer to recipients. Microsurgical bisection of morula and blastocyst stage embryos leads to a 2 to 3% monozygotic twinning rate of the transferred demiembryos, which is similar to that in rabbits and mice but considerably lower than in ruminants. It was found that with decreasing quality an increasing proportion of demi-embryos did not possess an inner cell mass. Porcine individual blastomeres derived from 4- and 8-cell embryos can be cultured in defined medium to the blastocyst stage. Leukemia inhibitory factor has been shown to be effective at defined embryonic stages and supports the formation of the inner cell mass in cultured isolated blastomeres in a concentration-dependent manner. For maintaining pregnancies with micromanipulated porcine embryos, it is not necessary to transfer extraordinarily high numbers of embryos. Porcine nuclear transfer is still struggling from the inefficiency of producing normally functioning blastocysts. Blastomeres, blastocyst-derived cells, fibroblasts and granulosa cells have been employed as donor cells in porcine nuclear transfer and have yielded blastocysts. Recently, the generation of the first piglets from somatic cell nuclear transfer has been achieved. DNA-microinjection into pronuclei of porcine zygotes has reliably resulted in the generation of transgenic pigs, which have special importance for the production of valuable pharmaceutical proteins in milk and xenotransplantation. It has been demonstrated that by expression of human complement regulatory proteins in transgenic pigs the hyperacute rejection response occurring after xenotransplantation can be overcome in a clinically relevant manner. Although biotechnological procedures in swine have recently undergone tremendous progress, the development is still lagging behind that in cattle and sheep. With regard to genetic engineering, considerable progress will originate from the possibility of employing homologous recombination in somatic cell lines and their subsequent use in nuclear transfer. In combination with the increasing knowledge in gene sequences this will allow in the foreseeable future widespread use in the pig industry either for agricultural or biomedical purposes.","['Niemann, H', 'Rath, D']","['Niemann H', 'Rath D']","['Department of Biotechnology, Institute of Animal Science and Behavior, Mariensee (FAL), Neustadt, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Theriogenology,Theriogenology,0421510,,IM,,"['Animals', 'Animals, Domestic', 'Biotechnology/*trends', 'Breeding/*methods', 'Cloning, Organism/trends/veterinary', 'Embryo Transfer/trends/veterinary', 'Fertilization in Vitro/trends/veterinary', 'Microinjections/trends/veterinary', 'Reproduction/*physiology', 'Swine/*embryology', 'Transplantation, Heterologous/trends/veterinary', 'Veterinary Medicine/trends']",2002/01/05 10:00,2002/01/10 10:01,['2002/01/05 10:00'],"['2002/01/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/10 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/05 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Theriogenology. 2001 Nov 1;56(8):1291-304. doi: 10.1016/s0093-691x(01)00630-6.,,"['S0093-691X(01)00630-6 [pii]', '10.1016/s0093-691x(01)00630-6 [doi]']",,77,,,,,,,,,,

Although their close topographic relationship with rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) suggests their derivation from it, their development and functional role are unclear. Their maturation phases were studied in 20 cases (19 hematologic neoplasms and 1 parathyroid adenoma) where electron microscopy had evidenced their presence. In 19 of thesecases, RLC were in an advanced stage of maturation, whereas in one (acute monoblastic leukemia) they were observed in the early stages of development and appeared to arise from peculiar RER configurations within blast cells, which were rich in both organelles. In this case, the authors observed numerous RER cisternae with distinctive cylindric, concentric and/or whorl configurations, RLC associated and not associated with these configurations, and intermediate structures. The latter were characterized by lamellae devoid of ribosomes oriented parallel to the RER configurations. Reticulum configurations were observed in no other case. The ultrastructural aspects observed in these 20 cases suggest that RLC synthesis proceeds as follows: (1) arrangement of RER in cylindric configurations; (2) synthesis of lamellae oriented parallel to the cylindric configurations (pre-RLC); (3) formation of RLC when ribosomes appear between the lamellae associated with configurations (immature RLC); (4) formation of mature RLC with disappearance of the reticulum.","['Morroni, M', 'Barbatelli, G']","['Morroni M', 'Barbatelli G']","['Servizio di Microscopia Elettronica, Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Umberto I, Ancona, Italy. morroni@popcsi.unian.it']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Ultrastruct Pathol,Ultrastructural pathology,8002867,['EC 1.11.1.7 (Peroxidase)'],IM,,"['Blood Platelets/enzymology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/enzymology/ultrastructure', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum, Rough/physiology/*ultrastructure', 'Humans', 'Inclusion Bodies/physiology/*ultrastructure', 'Intracellular Membranes/physiology/*ultrastructure', 'Male', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Middle Aged', 'Monocytes/ultrastructure', 'Peroxidase/analysis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/enzymology/pathology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Ribosomes/physiology/*ultrastructure']",2002/01/05 10:00,2002/04/19 10:01,['2002/01/05 10:00'],"['2002/01/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/04/19 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/05 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ultrastruct Pathol. 2001 Sep-Oct;25(5):335-43. doi: 10.1080/019131201317101199.,,['10.1080/019131201317101199 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

In that study, excess risks of total cancer and leukemia were observed among children living in homes with ""high or very high current configuration"", as categorised on the basis of proximity to electric lines and transformers. Many other epidemiological studies have been published since then, characterised by improved--although still not optimal--methods of exposure assessment. At the end of 2000, the epidemiological evidence to support the association between exposure to extremely-low-frequency magnetic fields and the risk of childhood leukemia is less consistent than what was observed in the mid 90s. At the same time, a growing body of experimental evidence has accumulated against both a direct and a promoting carcinogenic effect of ELF-EMF.

METHODS: VH region of B lymphocytes from children with ALL, patients with MM, and tissues from fetuses obtained by induced labor at different gestational stages was amplified using RT-PCR method with one primer located in VH1, VH2, VH3, VH4, VH5, or VH6 and another primer at the join region. The PCR products were then separated on sequencing gel and their VH gene fingerprints were obtained. The fingerprints from tissues of fetal liver, spleen, thymus and bone marrow, and bone marrow B cell from 15 cases of ALL and one case of MM were compared, and VH repertoire information were deduced from those fingerprints. RESULTS: The VH6 family was the dominant family in fetal liver and the VH3 family occurred predominantly in fetal spleen and bone marrow. Monoclonal proliferation of B lymphocytes was found in 9 of the 15 patients with ALL. Of these 9 cases, proliferation of VH1 was found in 3 cases, proliferation of VH6 was found in 3 cases, and proliferation of both VH3 and VH4 in 2 cases. The VH families other than leukemic clone(s) in these patients were in normal distribution or suppression status. Oligoclonality was found in one ALL case with malignant growth of VH1, VH3 and VH6. Polyclonality with nearly normal spectrum of VH1-VH6 was detected in 6 of the 15 cases. DNA sequencing of a VH3 clone from an ALL case demonstrated a similarity to the sequence of embryonic clone from a fetus of gestational age of 13 weeks. The VH sequence of one adult MM case, with hypermutation of somatic cell, was remarkably different from that of the germline.

The serum level of Tpo could be useful in prediction of the response to therapy in CITP patients.","['Liao, X', 'Wang, Y', 'Deng, C']","['Liao X', 'Wang Y', 'Deng C']","['Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital of West China University of Medical Sciences, Chengdu 610041, China.']",['chi'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Controlled Clinical Trial', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",China,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi = Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi,8212398,"['0 (Glucocorticoids)', '9014-42-0 (Thrombopoietin)']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Anemia, Aplastic/*blood', 'Blood Platelets/cytology/*metabolism', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Glucocorticoids/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*blood', 'Male', 'Megakaryocytes/cytology/metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Purpura, Thrombocytopenic, Idiopathic/*blood/drug therapy', 'Thrombopoietin/*blood']",2002/01/05 10:00,2002/01/24 10:01,['2002/01/05 10:00'],"['2002/01/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/24 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/05 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2001 Sep;22(9):473-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the frequency of LBL in the Far East is higher than that of Western countries, no reports regarding treatment of this disease have as yet been reported. We herein report our treatment experience and verify the efficacy of the Stanford/Northern California Oncology Group (NCOG) protocol for this disease and recommend treatment strategies for LBL patients. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of adult LBL patients treated in our hospital from 1986 to 1996. Twenty-seven patients were diagnosed to have LBL. These patients' ages ranged from 17 to 73 years old with a median of 23. Nineteen patients had an initial stage IV disease. Of the 23 cases in which immunological studies were performed, 20 proved to be of T cell lineage, 1 of B cell type, and the other 2 lacked both T and B markers. Three major chemotherapeutic regimens including prednisone, methotrexate, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, etoposide-mechlorethamine, vincristine, procarbazine, prednisone (ProMACE-MOPP), cyclophosphamide, hydroxydaunomycin, vincristine, prednisone (CHOP), and the Stanford/NCOG protocol were used to treat 3, 6, and 15 patients, respectively. Two other patients were treated with two different chemotherapeutic regimens, respectively. One patient was excluded for analysis because of initial treatment by surgery. The complete response (CR) rates with ProMACE-MOPP, CHOP, and the Stanford/NCOG regimens were 0%, 17%, 80% and median overall survival 9, 8.5, and 15 months, respectively. Five patients with stage II-III diseases achieved long-term disease-free survival of 11-36 months with the Stanford/NCOG protocol with a median follow-up of 24 months. Four patients in late stage or relapse received allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Two of them obtained long-term disease-free survival. Two other patients in CR were treated with high-dose chemotherapy (HDCT) supported with autologous BMT and peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT), respectively. The patient receiving HDCT with autologous PBSCT died of LBL relapse 6 months after transplantation. The other patient undergoing HDCT with autologous BMT died of fulminant hepatitis 5.5 months after transplantation. The median overall survival of all these 26 patients was 12 months. B symptoms and treatment without the Stanford/NCOG protocol were found to have significantly negative impacts on both patients' overall and progression-free survivals. Our results suggest that the Stanford/NCOG protocol may be an effective chemotherapy for adult LBL and may provide long-term remission for patients in an early stage of disease. For those patients with LBL in an advanced stage or in relapse, HDCT with allogeneic or autologous BMT is probably the treatment of choice.","['Chen, Y C', 'Ho, C L', 'Kao, W Y', 'Hwang, J M', 'Sheu, L F', 'Chao, T Y']","['Chen YC', 'Ho CL', 'Kao WY', 'Hwang JM', 'Sheu LF', 'Chao TY']","['Department of Medicine, Tri-Service General Hospital, National Defense Medical Center, Taipei, Taiwan, Republic of China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['35S93Y190K (Procarbazine)', '50D9XSG0VR (Mechlorethamine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)', 'CHOP protocol', 'ProMACE-MOPP protocol', 'Stanford-NCOG protocol']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/*administration & dosage', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cyclophosphamide/*administration & dosage', 'Doxorubicin/*administration & dosage', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mechlorethamine/administration & dosage', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/mortality/therapy', 'Prednisolone/*administration & dosage', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Procarbazine/administration & dosage', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Taiwan', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vincristine/*administration & dosage']",2002/01/05 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2002/01/05 10:00'],"['2002/01/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/05 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2001 Nov;80(11):647-52. doi: 10.1007/s002770100363.,,['10.1007/s002770100363 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Without separating disease entities, correlations between PB CD34+ cell counts and leukapheresis content of CD34+ cells (r>0.83, P<0.01) and CFU-GM (r>0.81, P<0.01) were excellent.

When data were analyzed by pathology, PB CD34+ cell counts and leukapheresis content of CD34+ cells and CFU-GM remained well correlated, and in both centers PB CD34 thresholds predictive of a yield > 10(6) CD34/kg per leukapheresis could be determined for each pathology. For most patients, pathology-specific PB CD34 thresholds could be obtained directly from the equation of the PB CD34/leukapheresis CD34 correlation curve; they varied depending on both pathology and center (range: 7-20 x 10(6) CD34/l). Pathology-specific thresholds predicted a leukapheresis yield > or = 10(6) CD34/kg accurately 100% of the time for MM patients in center 2 and HD and solid tumor patients of both centers, resulting in overall rates of accurate prediction of sufficient graft CD34 content of 96.6% in center 1 and 98.9% in center 2.","['Dobo, I', 'Robillard, N', 'Pineau, D', 'Genevieve, F', 'Piard, N', 'Rapp, M J', 'Boasson, M', 'Zandecki, M', 'Hermouet, S']","['Dobo I', 'Robillard N', 'Pineau D', 'Genevieve F', 'Piard N', 'Rapp MJ', 'Boasson M', 'Zandecki M', 'Hermouet S']","[""Laboratoire d'Hematologie du Centre Hospitalier Universitaire d'Angers, France.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD34/*analysis', 'Blood Cells/chemistry/*transplantation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Female', 'Forecasting', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/blood/pathology/*therapy', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/chemistry', 'Humans', 'Leukapheresis/*methods', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/pathology/therapy', 'Lymphoma/blood/pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloid Progenitor Cells/physiology', 'Neoplasms/blood/pathology/therapy', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",2002/01/05 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2002/01/05 10:00'],"['2002/01/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/05 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2001 Nov;80(11):639-46. doi: 10.1007/s002770100365.,,['10.1007/s002770100365 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

In particular, the prognostic impact of the speed of tumor regression was evaluated. From April 1990 to March 1995, 105 evaluable patients, 1.1-16.4 years of age, with T-LBL were enrolled into study NHL-BFM 90. Patients with stage I and II received an 8-drug induction followed by a consolidation including high-dose-methotrexate (MTX) and maintenance therapy up to a total therapy duration of 24 months. Patients with stage III and IV received an additional reinduction and cranial radiotherapy (CRT) (12 Gy for prophylaxis) between consolidation and maintenance. Residual tumor after completion of induction had to be resected. No local RT was applied. Patients received intensified chemotherapy if tumor regression on day 33 of induction was <70% or when vital residual tumor was present after the induction phase. With a median follow-up of 6.41 years, pEFS at 5 years is 91.4% (SE+/-2.7%). 101 patients were evaluable for the speed of tumor response. Two patients received intensified therapy due to <70% tumor regression on day 33. Of 19 patients with tumor residues after induction, 2 relapsed as compared to 4 of 80 patients with complete tumor regression. Our data demonstrate that, with intensive ALL-type chemotherapy but no local radiotherapy, an event-free survival rate of 90% can be achieved in childhood T-LBL. Providing tumor regression within 5 weeks is sufficient, tumor remnants after induction have weak prognostic impact.","['Grenzebach, J', 'Schrappe, M', 'Ludwig, W D', 'Parwaresch, R', 'Zimmermann, M', 'Gadner, H', 'Riehm, H', 'Reiter, A']","['Grenzebach J', 'Schrappe M', 'Ludwig WD', 'Parwaresch R', 'Zimmermann M', 'Gadner H', 'Riehm H', 'Reiter A']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Justus-Liebig-University, Giessen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)', 'AIEOP acute lymphoblastic leukemia protocol']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage', 'Austria', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cranial Irradiation', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Dexamethasone/administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Germany', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Life Tables', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/*drug therapy/mortality/radiotherapy', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/administration & dosage', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/mortality/radiotherapy', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Radiotherapy, Adjuvant', 'Remission Induction', 'Thioguanine/administration & dosage', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",2002/01/05 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2002/01/05 10:00'],"['2002/01/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/05 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2001;80 Suppl 3:B73-6. doi: 10.1007/pl00022795.,,['10.1007/pl00022795 [doi]'],['BFM-Group'],,,,,,,,,,,

Novel techniques have been developed to determine the global gene expression pattern of normal and neoplastic tissues. A cDNA microarray uniquely suitable for the analysis of B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (B-NHL) has been developed and preliminary analysis on diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), follicular lymphoma (FL) and B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) has been performed. These studies indicate that: 1) it is feasible to determine the gene expression profiles of archival lymphoma samples frozen and stored in a clinical setting, 2) the expression profile of these 3 types of lymphoproliferative disorders are distinctive, 3) DLBCL can be divided into at least 2 major subgroups according to their pattern of expression of B-cell associated genes and 4) the gene expression patterns in DLBCL appear to have prognostic significance. A larger study of DLBCL is currently underway to confirm and extend our findings. Gene expression profiles will be correlated with cytogenetic and clinical data to identify distinctive profiles that are of clinical and biological significance and to delineate key genetic lesions that determine these profiles. The new information will allow the design of a simpler and less expensive array for clinical use. The diagnostic array could provide rapid molecular characterization of every B-NHL at presentation for optimal treatment decisions and prognostication.

In control conditions, characteristic neuronal populations with and without neuropeptide Y (NPY) expression developed after 1 week, but following removal of non-neuronal cells, virtually all neurons expressed NPY. Thus, ganglionic non-neuronal cells downregulated NPY expression in some but not all neurons in vitro. Conditioned medium from non-neuronal cells restored heterogeneous NPY expression, a finding that suggests the factors are soluble. A non-neuronal cell-derived cytokine, leukemia inhibitory factor, dramatically reduced NPY expression in all neurons, but no concentration tested could recapitulate heterogeneous neuronal NPY expression. Sympathetic precursors that incorporated BrdU early in the culture were more likely to develop NPY expression than neurons that became postmitotic later in vitro.

We examined whether there are other consequences of PARP activation that could contribute to cell death. Here, we show that PARP activation reaction in vitro becomes acidic with release of protons during hydrolysis of beta-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide. In the cellular context, we show that Molt 3 cells respond to DNA damage by the alkylating agent N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) with a dose-dependent acidification within 30 min. Whereas acidification by 0.15 pH units induced by 10 microM MNNG is reversed within 1 h, 100 , microinduced acidification by 0.5-0.6 pH units is persistent up to 7 h. Acidification is a general DNA damage response because H(2)O(2) exposure also acidifies Molt 3 cells, and MNNG causes acidification in Jurkat, U937, or HL-60 leukemia cells and in PARP(+/+) fibroblasts. Acidification is significantly decreased in the presence of PARP inhibitors or in PARP(-/-) fibroblasts, suggesting a major role for PARP activation in acidification. Inhibition of proton export through ATP-dependent Na(+)/H(+) exchanger is another major cause of acidification. Using the pH clamp method to either suppress or introduce changes in cellular pH, we show that brief acidification by 0.5-0.6 pH units may be a negative regulator of apoptosis while permitting necrotic death of cells with extensively damaged DNA.","['Affar, El Bachir', 'Shah, Rashmi G', 'Dallaire, Annie-Karine', 'Castonguay, Vincent', 'Shah, Girish M']","['Affar el B', 'Shah RG', 'Dallaire AK', 'Castonguay V', 'Shah GM']","['Laboratory for Skin Cancer Research, Hospital Research Center of Laval University (Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Quebec), Faculty of Medicine, Laval University, 2705, Laurier Boulevard, Room S16, Sainte-Foy, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Alkylating Agents)', '0U46U6E8UK (NAD)', '108646-17-9 (nicotinamide arabinoside adenine dinucleotide)', '12H3O2UGSF (Methylnitronitrosoguanidine)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Alkylating Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Death', 'Cells, Cultured', '*DNA Damage', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Immunoblotting', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Methylnitronitrosoguanidine/pharmacology', 'NAD/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Necrosis', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/*physiology', 'Time Factors', 'U937 Cells']",2002/01/05 10:00,2002/04/16 10:01,['2002/01/05 10:00'],"['2002/01/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/04/16 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/05 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2002 Jan 8;99(1):245-50. doi: 10.1073/pnas.012460399.

METHODS: A method to measure hypocretin-1 in 100 microL of crude CSF sample was established and validated. CSF hypocretin-1 was measured in 42 narcolepsy patients (ages 16-70 years), 48 healthy controls (ages 22-77 years,) and 235 patients with various other neurologic conditions (ages 0-85 years). RESULTS: As previously reported, CSF hypocretin-1 levels were undetectably low (<100 pg/mL) in 37 of 42 narcolepsy subjects. Hypocretin-1 levels were detectable in all controls (224-653 pg/mL) and all neurologic patients (117-720 pg/mL), with the exception of three patients with Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS). Hypocretin-1 was within the control range in most neurologic patients tested, including patients with AD, PD, and MS. Low but detectable levels (100-194 pg/mL) were found in a subset of patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia, intracranial tumors, craniocerebral trauma, CNS infections, and GBS. CONCLUSIONS: Undetectable CSF hypocretin-1 levels are highly specific to narcolepsy and rare cases of GBS. Measuring hypocretin-1 levels in the CSF of patients suspected of narcolepsy is a useful diagnostic procedure. Low hypocretin levels are also observed in a large range of neurologic conditions, most strikingly in subjects with head trauma. These alterations may reflect focal lesions in the hypothalamus, destruction of the blood brain barrier, or transient or chronic hypofunction of the hypothalamus. Future research in this area is needed to establish functional significance.","['Ripley, B', 'Overeem, S', 'Fujiki, N', 'Nevsimalova, S', 'Uchino, M', 'Yesavage, J', 'Di Monte, D', 'Dohi, K', 'Melberg, A', 'Lammers, G J', 'Nishida, Y', 'Roelandse, F W', 'Hungs, M', 'Mignot, E', 'Nishino, S']","['Ripley B', 'Overeem S', 'Fujiki N', 'Nevsimalova S', 'Uchino M', 'Yesavage J', 'Di Monte D', 'Dohi K', 'Melberg A', 'Lammers GJ', 'Nishida Y', 'Roelandse FW', 'Hungs M', 'Mignot E', 'Nishino S']","['Stanford University Center for Narcolepsy, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Neurology,Neurology,0401060,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (HCRT protein, human)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Neuropeptides)', '0 (Orexins)']",IM,,"['Carrier Proteins/*cerebrospinal fluid', 'Humans', '*Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Narcolepsy/*cerebrospinal fluid', 'Nervous System Diseases/*cerebrospinal fluid', 'Neuropeptides/*cerebrospinal fluid', 'Orexins', 'Radioimmunoassay', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",2002/01/05 10:00,2003/02/13 04:00,['2002/01/05 10:00'],"['2002/01/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/02/13 04:00 [medline]', '2002/01/05 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Neurology. 2001 Dec 26;57(12):2253-8. doi: 10.1212/wnl.57.12.2253.,,['10.1212/wnl.57.12.2253 [doi]'],,,,,,"['MH01600/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'MH40041/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'NS 27710/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'NS 33797/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'NS23724/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,

Because trophoblastic cell migration and invasion are critical stages for the achievement of successful implantation and development of the placenta, we investigated VASP expression in different cell types of the human placenta throughout pregnancy by immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis. We also studied the effect of leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) on the regulation of VASP expression in first trimester placental tissue explants. We found that VASP is expressed throughout pregnancy by a variety of cells in the human placenta. The strongest VASP immunoreactivity was observed in the first trimester. In these samples, the most intense immunoreactivity was in invasive trophoblasts, namely, extravillous cells of the anchoring villi, distal extravillous trophoblasts of cell columns, and also in cells of placental fibrinoids. We also found that LIF (but not TGF-beta1) has a stimulatory effect on VASP expression in placental explants.

Runx1, Runx2, and Runx3 are the three known mammalian homologs of run. Runx1, which plays an essential role in hematopoiesis, has been identified at the breakpoint of chromosome translocations that are responsible for human leukemia. Runx2 plays an essential role in osteogenesis, and inactivation of one allele of Runx2 is responsible for the human disease cleidocranial dysplasia. To understand the role of run in C. elegans, we used transgenic run::GFP reporter constructs and a double-stranded RNA-mediated interference method. The expression of run was detected as early as the bean stage exclusively in the nuclei of seam hypodermal cells and lasted until the L3 stage. At the larval stage, expression of run was additionally detected in intestinal cells. The regulatory elements responsible for the postembryonic hypodermal seam cells and intestinal cells were separately located within a 7.2-kb-long intron region. This is the first report demonstrating that an intron region is essential for stage-specific and cell type-specific expression of a C. elegans gene. RNA interference analysis targeting the run gene resulted in an early larva-lethal phenotype, with apparent malformation of the hypodermis and intestine. These results suggest that run is involved in the development of a functional hypodermis and gut in C. elegans. The highly conserved role of the Runt domain transcription factor in gut development during evolution from nematodes to mammals is discussed.","['Nam, Seunghee', 'Jin, Yun-Hye', 'Li, Qing-Lin', 'Lee, Kwang-Youl', 'Jeong, Goo-Bo', 'Ito, Yoshiaki', 'Lee, Junho', 'Bae, Suk-Chul']","['Nam S', 'Jin YH', 'Li QL', 'Lee KY', 'Jeong GB', 'Ito Y', 'Lee J', 'Bae SC']","['Department of Biology, Yonsei University, Seoul 120-749, South Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Caenorhabditis elegans Proteins)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 1 Subunit)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 3 Subunit)', '0 (Core Binding Factor alpha Subunits)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (Runx3 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Animals, Genetically Modified', 'Caenorhabditis elegans/*genetics/growth & development/*physiology', 'Caenorhabditis elegans Proteins/*genetics/*physiology', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 1 Subunit', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 3 Subunit', 'Core Binding Factor alpha Subunits', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/*physiology', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Genes, Helminth', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Humans', 'Introns', '*Neoplasm Proteins', 'Phenotype', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/*physiology']",2002/01/05 10:00,2002/01/30 10:01,['2002/01/05 10:00'],"['2002/01/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/30 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/05 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2002 Jan;22(2):547-54. doi: 10.1128/MCB.22.2.547-554.2002.,,['10.1128/MCB.22.2.547-554.2002 [doi]'],,,,,,,PMC139740,,,,,

Drosophila Abl links neural axon guidance receptors to the cytoskeleton. Here we report a novel role for Drosophila Abl in epithelial cells, where it is critical for morphogenesis. Embryos completely lacking both maternal and zygotic Abl die with defects in several morphogenetic processes requiring cell shape changes and cell migration. We describe the cellular defects that underlie these problems, focusing on dorsal closure as an example. Further, we show that the Abl target Enabled (Ena), a modulator of actin dynamics, is involved with Abl in morphogenesis. We find that Ena localizes to adherens junctions of most epithelial cells, and that it genetically interacts with the adherens junction protein Armadillo (Arm) during morphogenesis. The defects of abl mutants are strongly enhanced by heterozygosity for shotgun, which encodes DE-cadherin. Finally, loss of Abl reduces Arm and alpha-catenin accumulation in adherens junctions, while having little or no effect on other components of the cytoskeleton or cell polarity machinery. We discuss possible models for Abl function during epithelial morphogenesis in light of these data.","['Grevengoed, E E', 'Loureiro, J J', 'Jesse, T L', 'Peifer, M']","['Grevengoed EE', 'Loureiro JJ', 'Jesse TL', 'Peifer M']","['Curriculum in Genetics and Molecular Biology, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC 27599-3280, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Cell Biol,The Journal of cell biology,0375356,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (GTPase-Activating Proteins)', '0 (Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Rho Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors)', '0 (rho GTPase-activating protein)', '0 (roundabout protein)']",IM,,"['3T3 Cells', 'Actins/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Axons/*physiology/ultrastructure', 'Drosophila/*genetics/physiology', 'Fibroblasts/cytology/physiology', 'GTPase-Activating Proteins/*metabolism', 'Gene Library', 'Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/metabolism', '*Nervous System Physiological Phenomena', 'Phenotype', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*metabolism', 'Rho Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors', 'Signal Transduction']",2002/01/05 10:00,2002/01/31 10:01,['2002/01/05 10:00'],"['2002/01/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/31 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/05 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Cell Biol. 2001 Dec 24;155(7):1185-98. doi: 10.1083/jcb.200105102.

However, little is known about the molecular mechanism in detail. We show here that TPO supports the survival of TPO-dependent leukemia cell line UT-7/TPO and normal megakaryocytic progenitors via the induction of Bcl-xL, an anti-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family. We further analyzed the signal transduction pathways required for TPO-induced Bcl-xL gene expression. A reporter assay with various lengths of Bcl-x gene promoter revealed that both Stat- and nuclear factor kappa B-binding sites are prerequisites for TPO-induced promoter activity. Consistent with these results, TPO induced the binding of Stat5 and subunits of nuclear factor kappa B, p50, and c-Rel to the Bcl-x gene promoter. AG490, a specific inhibitor for Jak2, and LY294002, a specific inhibitor for phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase, reduced the protein level of Bcl-xL in UT-7/TPO cells, accompanied by an increase in the ratio of apoptotic cells. Interestingly, LY294002 enhanced the TPO-induced DNA binding activity of Stat5 without affecting the Jak2 activation and tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat5. Concomitantly, confocal microscopy revealed that LY294002 clearly inhibited the nuclear export of Stat5, suggesting that PI 3-kinase regulates the subcellular localization of Stat5. Taken together, our results suggest that both Jak-Stat and PI 3-kinase activation pathways regulate the TPO-induced survival of megakaryocytic cells via Bcl-xL gene expression. In addition, our data suggest possible cross-talk between these two signaling pathways.","['Kirito, Keita', 'Watanabe, Tomoko', 'Sawada, Ken-ichi', 'Endo, Hitoshi', 'Ozawa, Keiya', 'Komatsu, Norio']","['Kirito K', 'Watanabe T', 'Sawada K', 'Endo H', 'Ozawa K', 'Komatsu N']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Jichi Medical School, Tochigi 329-04, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Chromones)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Milk Proteins)', '0 (Morpholines)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '31M2U1DVID (2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)', '9014-42-0 (Thrombopoietin)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,,"['Apoptosis', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cell Survival', 'Chromones/pharmacology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Down-Regulation', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Genes, Dominant', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2', 'Luciferases/metabolism', 'Microscopy, Confocal', '*Milk Proteins', 'Morpholines/pharmacology', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*chemistry/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*chemistry/*metabolism', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor', '*Signal Transduction', 'Thrombopoietin/*chemistry/*metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Trans-Activators/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'bcl-X Protein']",2002/01/05 10:00,2002/04/16 10:01,['2002/01/05 10:00'],"['2002/01/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/04/16 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/05 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2002 Mar 8;277(10):8329-37. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M109824200.

Uterine flushing fluids were analysed to determine their concentrations of leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and tumour necrosis factor (TNF). METHODS AND RESULTS: We began by flushing the uterine cavities of 33 infertile patients on day 26 of two consecutive cycles. The concentrations of LIF (by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) and TNF (by bioassay) were significantly correlated during these cycles (r = 0.762, P = 0.0001 and r = 0.822, P = 0.001 respectively) and hence reliable. Then, after a reference flushing of 30 infertile patients, we followed the outcome of their first consecutive cycle of ovarian stimulation, which preceded either IVF or intrauterine insemination. A total of 10 patients became pregnant. The median concentration of LIF was 0 pg/ml (range: 0-177) and of TNF was 0 U/ml (range: 0-6.17) among those who became pregnant, and 203 pg/ml (range: 0-1620) and 2.14 U/ml (range: 0-16) respectively among those who did not. The LIF concentration was significantly lower in the pregnant group (P = 0.0013). CONCLUSION: A low concentration of LIF in the uterine flushing fluid at day 26 was predictive of subsequent implantation. Use of this procedure should increase the number of IVF attempts yielding successful pregnancies and also lead to corrective therapies.","['Ledee-Bataille, N', 'Lapree-Delage, G', 'Taupin, J-L', 'Dubanchet, S', 'Frydman, R', 'Chaouat, G']","['Ledee-Bataille N', 'Lapree-Delage G', 'Taupin JL', 'Dubanchet S', 'Frydman R', 'Chaouat G']","['INSERM U131, Clamart, France.

METHODS: Hydrosalpinx fluids were collected from 39 infertile women participating in an IVF-embryo transfer programme at a university teaching hospital. The fluids were analysed for concentrations of cytokine concentration (epidermal growth factor, interferon-gamma, leukaemia inhibitory factor, and tumour necrosis factor-alpha) and chemical composition. Mouse embryos were cultured in medium with various concentrations (0, 10, 50, 100%) of hydrosalpinx fluid. RESULTS: Logistic regression demonstrated that a murine blastocyst formation rate >or=53.3% in 50% hydrosalpinx fluid (OR = 16.6, 95% CI 2.4-116.1, P = 0.005) and patient age (OR = 0.778, 95% CI 0.61-0.99, P = 0.045) were independent predictors of IVF outcome. The diagnostic accuracy did not significantly improve when age and number of good quality embryos transferred was taken into account. The chemical composition and cytokine concentrations of hydrosalpinx fluid were not predictive of subsequent IVF outcome. CONCLUSIONS: The mouse embryo assay of hydrosalpinx fluid might potentially serve as a predictor of subsequent IVF outcome in women with hydrosalpinx.

Curcumin, a diferuloylmethane, is a major active component of the food flavor turmeric (Curcuma longa) that has been shown to inhibit the proliferation of a wide variety of tumor cells. The apoptotic intermediates through which curcumin exhibits its cytotoxic effects against tumor cells are not known, and the participation of antiapoptotic proteins Bcl-2 or Bcl-xl in the curcumin-induced apoptosis pathway is not established. In the present report we investigated the effect of curcumin on the activation of the apoptotic pathway in human acute myelogenous leukemia HL-60 cells and in established stable cell lines expressing Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl. Curcumin inhibited the growth of HL-60 cells (neo) in a dose- and time-dependent manner, whereas Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl-transfected cells were relatively resistant. Curcumin activated caspase-8 and caspase-3 in HL-60 neo cells but not in Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl-transfected cells. Similarly, time-dependent poly(ADP)ribose polymerase (PARP) cleavage by curcumin was observed in neo cells but not in Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl-transfected cells. Curcumin treatment also induced BID cleavage and mitochondrial cytochrome c release in neo cells but not in Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl-transfected cells. In neo HL-60 cells, curcumin also downregulated the expression of cyclooxygenase-2. Because DN-FLICE blocked curcumin-induced apoptosis, caspase-8 must play a critical role. Overall, our results indicate that curcumin induces apoptosis through mitochondrial pathway involving caspase-8, BID cleavage, cytochrome c release, and caspase-3 activation. Our results also suggest that Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl are critical negative regulators of curcumin-induced apoptosis.","['Anto, Ruby John', 'Mukhopadhyay, Asok', 'Denning, Kate', 'Aggarwal, Bharat B']","['Anto RJ', 'Mukhopadhyay A', 'Denning K', 'Aggarwal BB']","['Cytokine Research Section, Department of Bioimmunotherapy, Box 143, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Blvd., Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Carcinogenesis,Carcinogenesis,8008055,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein)', '0 (BID protein, human)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cytochrome c Group)', '0 (FADD protein, human)', '0 (Fas-Associated Death Domain Protein)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (Cyclooxygenase 2)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (PTGS2 protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthases)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP8 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'IT942ZTH98 (Curcumin)']",IM,,"['*Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein', 'Blotting, Western', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspase 8', 'Caspase 9', 'Caspases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Survival', 'Curcumin/*pharmacology', 'Cyclooxygenase 2', 'Cytochrome c Group/*metabolism', 'Down-Regulation', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Fas-Associated Death Domain Protein', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/metabolism', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/*metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'bcl-X Protein']",2002/01/05 10:00,2002/02/15 10:01,['2002/01/05 10:00'],"['2002/01/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/15 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/05 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Carcinogenesis. 2002 Jan;23(1):143-50. doi: 10.1093/carcin/23.1.143.,,['10.1093/carcin/23.1.143 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

In the current study the effects of the C-28 methyl ester of CDDO, CDDO-Me, were analyzed on cell growth and apoptosis of leukemic cell lines and primary acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). CDDO-Me decreased the viability of leukemic cell lines, including multidrug resistant (MDR)-1-overexpressing, p53(null) HL-60-Dox and of primary AML cells, and it was 3- to 5-fold more active than CDDO. CDDO-Me induced a loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, induction of caspase-3 cleavage, increase in annexin V binding and DNA fragmentation, suggesting the induction of apoptosis. CDDO-Me induced pro-apoptotic Bax protein that preceded caspase activation. Furthermore, CDDO-Me inhibited the activation of ERK1/2, as determined by the inhibition of mitochondrial ERK1/2 phosphorylation, and it blocked Bcl-2 phosphorylation, rendering Bcl-2 less anti-apoptotic. CDDO-Me induced granulo-monocytic differentiation in HL-60 cells and monocytic differentiation in primary cells. Of significance, colony formation of AML progenitors was significantly inhibited in a dose-dependent fashion, whereas normal CD34(+) progenitor cells were less affected. Combinations with ATRA or the RXR-specific ligand LG100268 enhanced the effects of CDDO-Me on cell viability and terminal differentiation of myeloid leukemic cell lines. In conclusion, CDDO-Me is an MDR-1- and a p53-independent compound that exerts strong antiproliferative, apoptotic, and differentiating effects in myeloid leukemic cell lines and in primary AML samples when given in submicromolar concentrations. Differential effects of CDDO-Me on leukemic and normal progenitor cells suggest that CDDO-Me has potential as a novel compound in the treatment of hematologic malignancies.","['Konopleva, Marina', 'Tsao, Twee', 'Ruvolo, Peter', 'Stiouf, Irina', 'Estrov, Zeev', 'Leysath, Clinton E', 'Zhao, Shourong', 'Harris, David', 'Chang, Shirong', 'Jackson, C Ellen', 'Munsell, Mark', 'Suh, Nanjoo', 'Gribble, Gordon', 'Honda, Tadashi', 'May, W Stratford', 'Sporn, Michael B', 'Andreeff, Michael']","['Konopleva M', 'Tsao T', 'Ruvolo P', 'Stiouf I', 'Estrov Z', 'Leysath CE', 'Zhao S', 'Harris D', 'Chang S', 'Jackson CE', 'Munsell M', 'Suh N', 'Gribble G', 'Honda T', 'May WS', 'Sporn MB', 'Andreeff M']","['Department of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Section of Molecular Hematology and Therapy, The University of Texas M.

The overall sensitivity of CML CD34(+) progenitor cells to STI571 and the degree to which cell death was dependent on cell cycle status were determined. Stem cells (Lin(-)CD34(+)) from the peripheral blood of patients with CML in chronic phase and from granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor-mobilized healthy donors were labeled with carboxy-fluorescein diacetate succinimidyl diester dye to enable high-resolution tracking of cell division. Then they were cultured for 3 days with and without growth factors +/- STI571. After culture, the cells were separated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting into populations of viable quiescent versus cycling cells for genotyping. For healthy controls, in the presence of growth factors, STI571 affected neither cell cycle kinetics nor recovery of viable cells. In the absence of growth factors, normal cells were unable to divide. For CML samples, in the presence or absence of growth factors, the response to STI571 was variable. In the most sensitive cases, STI571 killed almost all dividing cells; however, a significant population of viable CD34(+) cells was recovered in the undivided peak and confirmed to be part of the leukemic clone. STI571 also appeared to exhibit antiproliferative activity on the quiescent population. These studies confirm that CML stem cells remain viable in a quiescent state even in the presence of growth factors and STI571. Despite dramatic short-term responses in vivo, such in vitro insensitivity to STI571, in combination with its demonstrated antiproliferative activity, could translate into disease relapse after prolonged therapy.","['Graham, Susan M', 'Jorgensen, Heather G', 'Allan, Elaine', 'Pearson, Charlie', 'Alcorn, Michael J', 'Richmond, Linda', 'Holyoake, Tessa L']","['Graham SM', 'Jorgensen HG', 'Allan E', 'Pearson C', 'Alcorn MJ', 'Richmond L', 'Holyoake TL']","['Department of Medicine, Royal Infirmary, Glasgow, Scotland. smg16a@clinmed.gla.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Culture Media, Serum-Free)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,,"['Antigens, CD34/analysis', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Culture Media, Serum-Free', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Growth Substances/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/immunology/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*pathology', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/01/05 10:00,2002/01/29 10:01,['2002/01/05 10:00'],"['2002/01/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/29 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/05 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2002 Jan 1;99(1):319-25. doi: 10.1182/blood.v99.1.319.,,"['10.1182/blood.v99.1.319 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)38415-9 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Activating mutations in FLT3 have been identified in approximately 30% of patients with acute myelogenous leukemia, making it one of the most common mutations observed in this disease. Frequently, the mutation is an in-frame internal tandem duplication (ITD) in the juxtamembrane region that results in constitutive activation of FLT3, and confers interleukin-3 (IL-3)-independent growth to Ba/F3 and 32D cells. FLT3-ITD mutants were cloned from primary human leukemia samples and assayed for transformation of primary hematopoietic cells using a murine bone marrow transplantation assay. FLT3-ITDs induced an oligoclonal myeloproliferative disorder in mice, characterized by splenomegaly and leukocytosis. The myeloproliferative phenotype, which was associated with extramedullary hematopoiesis in the spleen and liver, was confirmed by histopathologic and flow cytometric analysis. The disease latency of 40 to 60 days with FLT3-ITDs contrasted with wild-type FLT3 and enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) controls, which did not develop hematologic disease (> 200 days). These results demonstrate that FLT3-ITD mutant proteins are sufficient to induce a myeloproliferative disorder, but are insufficient to recapitulate the AML phenotype observed in humans. Additional mutations that impair hematopoietic differentiation may be required for the development of FLT3-ITD-associated acute myeloid leukemias. This model system should be useful to assess the contribution of additional cooperating mutations and to evaluate specific FLT3 inhibitors in vivo.","['Kelly, Louise M', 'Liu, Qing', 'Kutok, Jeffrey L', 'Williams, Ifor R', 'Boulton, Christina L', 'Gilliland, D Gary']","['Kelly LM', 'Liu Q', 'Kutok JL', 'Williams IR', 'Boulton CL', 'Gilliland DG']","[""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-1)']",IM,['Blood. 2002 Jul 1;100(1):364.

It was previously demonstrated that ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) gene mutations can occur in B-CLL and cause a defect in the p53 pathway. Here the role of ATM mutations in the pathogenesis of B-CLL is addressed. Of 50 B-CLL tumors with fully analyzed ATM and TP53, 16 had ATM mutations. Six of 50 B-CLLs showed mutations in TP53 and the remaining 28 tumors had wild-type ATM or TP53. No tumor had both ATM and TP53 mutations. Remarkably, all 16 ATM mutant B-CLLs showed the absence of somatic variable region heavy chain hypermutation indicating a pregerminal center cell origin and a common pathogenesis for these tumors. Furthermore, in 5 of the 16 B-CLLs, ATM mutation preceded the transformation stage of differentiation. At the cellular level, ATM mutant tumors exhibited a deficient ATM-dependent p53 response to gamma irradiation, failure to up-regulate TRAIL-R2, a downstream target that links irradiation-induced p53 response with apoptosis, and an inability to repair induced chromosome breaks. Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is also of pregerminal center origin and ATM mutations are frequent in this malignancy. It is concluded that ATM is likely to play an important role at the pregerminal center stage and a model is proposed where loss of ATM function during B-cell ontogeny drives B-CLL tumorigenesis in pregerminal B cells by a dual defect in p53 damage response and repair of chromosome breaks.","['Stankovic, Tatjana', 'Stewart, Grant S', 'Fegan, Christopher', 'Biggs, Paul', 'Last, James', 'Byrd, Philip J', 'Keenan, Russell D', 'Moss, Paul A H', 'Taylor, Alexander M R']","['Stankovic T', 'Stewart GS', 'Fegan C', 'Biggs P', 'Last J', 'Byrd PJ', 'Keenan RD', 'Moss PA', 'Taylor AM']","['University of Birmingham, CRC Institute for Cancer Studies, The Medical School, Edgbaston, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (TNFRSF10B protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (ATM protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Apoptosis/radiation effects', 'Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', '*DNA Damage', 'DNA Repair/*genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Female', 'Gamma Rays', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes, p53/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/analysis/deficiency/*genetics', 'Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/genetics', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",2002/01/05 10:00,2002/01/29 10:01,['2002/01/05 10:00'],"['2002/01/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/29 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/05 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2002 Jan 1;99(1):300-9. doi: 10.1182/blood.v99.1.300.,,"['10.1182/blood.v99.1.300 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)38413-5 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

We have recently reported that the ligation of CD44 with 2 activating monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), A3D8 and H90, triggers terminal differentiation of leukemic blasts in AML-M1/2 to AML-M5 subtypes, which are the most frequent ones. However, fresh AML blasts have short in vitro lifespans. Therefore, to find relevant in vitro cellular models for further studying the mechanisms involved in CD44-induced differentiation, we investigated whether CD44 ligation with A3D8 and H90 mAbs can induce terminal differentiation of THP-1, NB4, and HL60 cells, each interesting models of AML-M5 (monoblastic subtype), AML-M3 (promyelocytic subtype), and AML-M2 (myeloblastic subtype), respectively. We also study whether CD44 ligation induces a loss of proliferative capacity, an important feature of late-stage myeloid differentiation. In the second part of our study, we investigated whether A3D8 and H90 anti-CD44 mAbs can induce the differentiation and inhibit the proliferation of KG1a cells, which are very immature AML-M0 blasts. Using functional, antigenic, and cytologic criteria, we presently show that A3D8 and/or H90 induce terminal differentiation of THP-1, HL60, and NB4 cell lines and strongly inhibit their proliferation. Interestingly, cell-specific effects of H90 and A3D8 are observed. We also observe that incubation with A3D8 for 3 to 6 days induces an apoptotic cell death that is moderate in the case of THP-1 and HL60 cells and massive in the case of NB4 cells. Finally, our results demonstrate for the first time that it is possible to reverse the leukemic blockage of KG1a cells by using both an anti-CD44 mAb and retinoic acid. This result may provide a new experimental basis for a differentiative therapy in AML-M0 patients.","['Charrad, Rachida-Sihem', 'Gadhoum, Zeineb', 'Qi, Junyuan', 'Glachant, Anne', 'Allouche, Michele', 'Jasmin, Claude', 'Chomienne, Christine', 'Smadja-Joffe, Florence']","['Charrad RS', 'Gadhoum Z', 'Qi J', 'Glachant A', 'Allouche M', 'Jasmin C', 'Chomienne C', 'Smadja-Joffe F']","['Inserm U268, Laboratoire de differenciation hematopoietique normale et leucemique, Hopital Paul-Brousse, Villejuif, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Hyaluronan Receptors)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*pharmacology', '*Apoptosis/drug effects', '*Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Granulocytes/pathology', 'HL-60 Cells/pathology', 'Humans', 'Hyaluronan Receptors/immunology/*physiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/01/05 10:00,2002/01/29 10:01,['2002/01/05 10:00'],"['2002/01/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/29 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/05 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2002 Jan 1;99(1):290-9. doi: 10.1182/blood.v99.1.290.,,"['10.1182/blood.v99.1.290 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)38412-3 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, bone marrow biopsy specimens from 36 patients with T-cell GLL and from 25 control patients with cytopenias and relative or absolute increases in blood large granular lymphocytes were studied by immunohistochemistry using antibodies to the cytolytic lymphocyte antigens CD8, CD56, CD57, TIA-1, and granzyme B. The goals were to clarify the bone marrow pathology of T-cell GLL and to refine the diagnostic criteria for T-cell GLL. Most bone marrow specimens from the T-cell GLL patients contained interstitially distributed clusters of at least 8 CD8(+) (83%) or TIA-1(+) (75%) lymphocytes or clusters of at least 6 granzyme B(+) (50%) lymphocytes. Interstitial clusters of CD8(+), TIA-1(+), or granzyme B(+) cells were present in 36%, 12%, and 0%, respectively, of the control bone marrows (all values significantly different, P <.001). An additional T-cell GLL disease-specific finding was the presence of linear arrays of intravascular CD8(+), TIA-1(+), or granzyme B(+) lymphocytes, found in 67% of cases of T-cell GLL and in none of the 25 control samples (P <.001). Staining for CD56 and CD57 was noncontributory.

STATs are dysregulated in acute myeloid leukemia (AML); mechanisms of dysregulation include constitutive activation and truncation of the C-terminal transactivation domain; the latter results in a beta isoform that has a trans-dominant negative effect on gene induction mediated by the full-length STAT alpha form. It was hypothesized that constitutive STAT activity might correlate with unfavorable treatment outcome in AML. Pretreatment bone marrow samples from 63 adult patients with AML were analyzed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay for the presence of STAT DNA-binding activity. Isoforms and relative levels of STAT proteins were determined by immunoblotting. Constitutive STAT3 activity was detected in samples from 28 (44%) patients. Pretreatment clinical characteristics, expression of STAT alpha/beta isoforms, and treatment regimens did not differ significantly between patients with and without constitutive STAT3 activity. Disease-free survival (DFS) was significantly shorter in patients with than in patients without constitutive STAT3 activity (median 8.7 vs 20.6 months; P =.01). Overall survival did not differ significantly. The subgroup of patients with constitutive STAT3 activity and the STAT3 beta isoform had the shortest DFS (P =.006) and shorter overall survival (P =.049) than all other patients. Whether adverse treatment outcome is attributable to constitutive STAT activity itself or to a process that leads to constitutive STAT activity remains to be determined. This is the first demonstration of a prognostic significance for STAT proteins in a malignancy.","['Benekli, Mustafa', 'Xia, Zheng', 'Donohue, Kathleen A', 'Ford, Laurie A', 'Pixley, Lynda A', 'Baer, Maria R', 'Baumann, Heinz', 'Wetzler, Meir']","['Benekli M', 'Xia Z', 'Donohue KA', 'Ford LA', 'Pixley LA', 'Baer MR', 'Baumann H', 'Wetzler M']","['Leukemia Section, Department of Medicine, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, NY 14263, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,,"['Bone Marrow/chemistry', 'DNA/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/analysis/*physiology', '*Disease-Free Survival', 'Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*mortality/pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Isoforms/analysis', 'Remission Induction', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'Survival Rate', 'Trans-Activators/analysis/*physiology', 'Treatment Outcome']",2002/01/05 10:00,2002/01/29 10:01,['2002/01/05 10:00'],"['2002/01/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/29 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/05 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2002 Jan 1;99(1):252-7. doi: 10.1182/blood.v99.1.252.,,"['10.1182/blood.v99.1.252 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)38407-X [pii]']",,,,,,"['CA16056/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA26122/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,

The prognosis for DS acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is better than for non-DS AML, but the clinical outcome of DS acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is equal to that of non-DS ALL. Differences in prognosis may reflect differences in cellular drug resistance. In vitro drug resistance profiles were successfully investigated on leukemic cells from 13 patients with DS AML and 9 patients with DS ALL and were compared with reference data from 151 non-DS AML and 430 non-DS B-cell precursor (BCP) ALL. DS AML cells were significantly more sensitive to cytarabine (median, 12-fold), the anthracyclines (2-7-fold), mitoxantrone (9-fold), amsacrine (16-fold), etoposide (20-fold), 6-thioguanine (3-fold), busulfan (5-fold), vincristine (23-fold), and prednisolone (more than 1.1-fold), than non-DS AML cells. Compared with DS ALL, DS AML cells were significantly more sensitive to cytarabine only (21-fold). After short-term exposure to methotrexate, DS AML cells were 21-fold more resistant than non-DS AML cells, but no difference was observed after continuous exposure. DS ALL cells and non-DS BCP-ALL cells were equally sensitive to all drugs, including methotrexate. Normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells from DS and non-DS children without leukemia showed highly resistant drug profiles. It was concluded that the better prognosis of DS AML might, at least partially, be explained by a specific, relatively sensitive drug-resistance profile, reflecting the unique biology of this disease.

This effect did not require productive infection and occurred when HTLV-2 was produced from T cells (CMo), but not from B cells (BMo), unless the latter virus was complexed with anti-HLA-DR monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Cellular and molecular mechanisms triggered by HTLV-2 interaction with TF-1 cells were here investigated. Activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 5 protein occurred in TF-1 cells incubated either with IL-3 or with HTLV-2/CMo; in addition the virus, but not IL-3, activated STAT1. The effect of HTLV-2 required several hours, suggesting dependence on the induction of cellular factors. By screening a panel of secreted factors, granulocyte macrophage-colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interferon (IFN)-gamma, and stem cell factor (SCF) were found induced by HTLV-2 in TF-1 cells. Of note is the fact that these molecules induce a variety of biologic effects through the activation of STAT proteins, including STAT1 and STAT5. Neutralization experiments indicated that GM-CSF and IFN-gamma, but not SCF, were responsible for HTLV-2-induced STAT activation, whereas anti-GM-CSF antibodies greatly inhibited TF-1 cell proliferation. Finally, incubation of BMo virus with anti-HLA-DR mAb rescued TF-1 cell survival in the absence of IL-3. Thus, HTLV-2 interaction with CD34(+) precursor cells may lead to the expression of cytokines that, by inducing autocrine activation of STATs, may influence the host's regenerative capacity and immune response to HTLV-2 and to other infectious agents.","['Bovolenta, Chiara', 'Pilotti, Elisabetta', 'Mauri, Massimiliano', 'Turci, Marco', 'Ciancianaini, Paolo', 'Fisicaro, Paola', 'Bertazzoni, Umberto', 'Poli, Guido', 'Casoli, Claudio']","['Bovolenta C', 'Pilotti E', 'Mauri M', 'Turci M', 'Ciancianaini P', 'Fisicaro P', 'Bertazzoni U', 'Poli G', 'Casoli C']","['AIDS Immunopathogenesis Unit, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy. c.bovolenta@hsr.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Milk Proteins)', '0 (STAT1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT1 protein, human)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '21820-51-9 (Phosphotyrosine)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', 'Antigens, CD34/analysis', 'B-Lymphocytes/virology', '*Cell Differentiation', '*Cell Survival', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*physiology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/metabolism', 'HLA-DR Antigens/immunology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 2/immunology/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/metabolism', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', '*Milk Proteins', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phosphotyrosine/metabolism', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor', 'Stem Cell Factor/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/virology', 'Trans-Activators/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/01/05 10:00,2002/01/29 10:01,['2002/01/05 10:00'],"['2002/01/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/29 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/05 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2002 Jan 1;99(1):224-31. doi: 10.1182/blood.v99.1.224.,,"['10.1182/blood.v99.1.224 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)38403-2 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

This effect was found to be indirect and was mediated through natural killer (NK) cells that constitute the major lymphoid cell contaminating day 6 megakaryocyte cell populations. IL-2 had no effect on megakaryocytes generated from CD34(+) cells stimulated with IL-3 and SCF. However, medium conditioned by IL-2-stimulated, but not resting, NK cells (NKCM) contained a trypsin-sensitive factor capable of increasing 2- to 5-fold the number of polyploid megakaryocytes generated in vitro from IL-3 and SCF-stimulated CD34(+) cells. The activity in NKCM was dose dependent and could not be neutralized by an excess of antibodies to IL-6, IL-11, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), gp130, stromal cell derived factor-1a (SDF-1a), and thrombopoietin (TPO). Addition of IL-11, but not TPO, to NKCM-containing cultures resulted in further augmentation of polyploidy, with the generation of 50% to 70% polyploid megakaryocytes with a modal ploidy of 16N. This factor is distinct from TPO because it induces endomitosis in IL-3-generated megakaryocytes in vitro, whereas TPO does not, and its activity on megakaryocyte ploidy is not altered by optimal concentrations of TPO. In addition, no message for TPO is detectable in IL-2-stimulated NK cells by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. These findings indicate that IL-2-stimulated NK cells produce a novel peptide, distinct from TPO, IL-6, IL-11, LIF, other gp130-associated interleukins, and SDF1a, that can induce in vitro endomitosis in immature human megakaryocytes in the presence of IL-3 and SCF.","['Angchaisuksiri, Pantep', 'Grigus, Shawn R', 'Carlson, Patricia L', 'Krystal, Geoffrey W', 'Dessypris, Emmanuel N']","['Angchaisuksiri P', 'Grigus SR', 'Carlson PL', 'Krystal GW', 'Dessypris EN']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Hunter Holmes McGuire Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, and the Medical College of Virginia, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA 23249, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (CXCL12 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL12)', '0 (Chemokines, CXC)', '0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (IL6ST protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-11)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)', '9014-42-0 (Thrombopoietin)']",IM,,"['Antigens, CD/pharmacology', 'Antigens, CD34/analysis', 'Chemokine CXCL12', 'Chemokines, CXC/pharmacology', 'Culture Media, Conditioned', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130', 'Growth Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-11/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-2/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*physiology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Megakaryocytes/*pathology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/pharmacology', 'Mitosis/*drug effects', 'Peptides/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Ploidies', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Stem Cell Factor/pharmacology', 'Thrombopoietin/genetics/pharmacology']",2002/01/05 10:00,2002/01/29 10:01,['2002/01/05 10:00'],"['2002/01/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/29 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/05 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2002 Jan 1;99(1):130-6. doi: 10.1182/blood.v99.1.130.,,"['10.1182/blood.v99.1.130 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)38390-7 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Hoxa9 overexpression in mouse bone marrow cells invariably leads to AML within 3 to 10 months, suggesting the requirement for additional genetic events prior to AML. To gain further insight into how Hoxa9 affects hematopoietic development at the preleukemic stage, we have engineered its overexpression (1) in hematopoietic stem cells using retrovirus-mediated gene transfer and generated bone marrow transplantation chimeras and (2) in lymphoid cells using transgenic mice. Compared with controls, recipients of Hoxa9-transduced cells had an about 15-fold increase in transplantable lymphomyeloid long-term repopulating cells, indicating the capacity for this oncogene to confer a growth advantage to hematopoietic stem cells. In addition, overexpression of Hoxa9 in more mature cells enhanced granulopoiesis and partially blocked B lymphopoiesis at the pre-B-cell stage but had no detectable effect on T lymphoid development. Interestingly, despite specifically directing high expression of Hoxa9 in T and B lymphoid lineages, none of the Hoxa9 transgenic mice developed lymphoid malignancies for the observation period of more than 18 months.","['Thorsteinsdottir, Unnur', 'Mamo, Aline', 'Kroon, Evert', 'Jerome, Lori', 'Bijl, Janet', 'Lawrence, H Jeffrey', 'Humphries, Keith', 'Sauvageau, Guy']","['Thorsteinsdottir U', 'Mamo A', 'Kroon E', 'Jerome L', 'Bijl J', 'Lawrence HJ', 'Humphries K', 'Sauvageau G']","['Laboratory of Molecular Genetics of Hemopoietic Stem Cells, Clinical Research Institute of Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (homeobox protein HOXA9)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Division', '*Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Granulocytes', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Transfection', 'Transplantation Chimera']",2002/01/05 10:00,2002/01/29 10:01,['2002/01/05 10:00'],"['2002/01/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/29 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/05 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2002 Jan 1;99(1):121-9. doi: 10.1182/blood.v99.1.121.,,"['10.1182/blood.v99.1.121 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)38389-0 [pii]']",,,,,,['R01-DK48642/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,

It was previously demonstrated that erythropoietin (EPO), a major regulator of erythropoiesis, activates 3 different Stat members, Stat1, Stat3, and Stat5, in a human EPO-dependent cell line, UT-7/EPO. To clarify the mechanism by which EPO activates Stat1 and Stat3 via the EPO receptor (EPOR), a series of chimeric receptors was constructed bearing the extracellular domain of the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor linked to the transmembrane domain of EPOR and the full length or several mutants of the cytoplasmic domain of EPOR, and these chimeric receptor complementary DNAs were introduced into UT-7/EPO cells. Tyr432 on human EPOR was important for activation of Stat1 and Stat3 and c-myc gene induction. In addition, Jak2 and Fes tyrosine kinases were involved in EPO-induced activation of Stat1 and Stat3. These results indicate that Stat1 and Stat3 are activated by EPO via distinct mechanisms from Stat5.","['Kirito, Keita', 'Nakajima, Koichi', 'Watanabe, Tomoko', 'Uchida, Mie', 'Tanaka, Masaru', 'Ozawa, Keiya', 'Komatsu, Norio']","['Kirito K', 'Nakajima K', 'Watanabe T', 'Uchida M', 'Tanaka M', 'Ozawa K', 'Komatsu N']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Jichi Medical School, Tochigi, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Fusion Proteins, gag-onc)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Receptors, Erythropoietin)', '0 (Receptors, Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (STAT1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT1 protein, human)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (v-fps oncogene protein, Fujinami sarcoma virus)']",IM,,"['Cell Division', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*physiology', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', '*Erythropoiesis', 'Erythropoietin/pharmacology', 'Fusion Proteins, gag-onc/metabolism', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2', 'Leukemia', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/genetics', 'Receptors, Erythropoietin/*chemistry/genetics/*physiology', 'Receptors, Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/chemistry/genetics', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Trans-Activators/*physiology', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tyrosine']",2002/01/05 10:00,2002/01/29 10:01,['2002/01/05 10:00'],"['2002/01/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/29 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/05 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2002 Jan 1;99(1):102-10. doi: 10.1182/blood.v99.1.102.,,"['10.1182/blood.v99.1.102 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)38387-7 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

AML1-ETO interferes with the function of the AML1 (RUNX1, CBFA2) transcription factor in a dominant-negative fashion and represses transcription by binding its consensus DNA-binding site and via protein-protein interactions with other transcription factors. AML1 activity is critical for the development of definitive hematopoiesis, and haploinsufficiency of AML1 has been linked to a propensity to develop AML. Murine experiments suggest that AML1-ETO expression may not be sufficient for leukemogenesis; however, like the BCR-ABL isoforms, the cellular background in which these fusion proteins are expressed may be critical to the phenotype observed. Retroviral gene transfer was used to examine the effect of AML1-ETO on the in vitro behavior of human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. Following transduction of CD34(+) cells, stem and progenitor cells were quantified in clonogenic assays, cytokine-driven expansion cultures, and long-term stromal cocultures. Expression of AML1-ETO inhibited colony formation by committed progenitors, but enhanced the growth of stem cells (cobblestone area-forming cells), resulting in a profound survival advantage of transduced over nontransduced cells. AML1-ETO-expressing cells retained progenitor activity and continued to express CD34 throughout the 5-week long-term culture. Thus, AML1-ETO enhances the self-renewal of pluripotent stem cells, the physiological target of many acute myeloid leukemias.","['Mulloy, James C', 'Cammenga, Jorg', 'MacKenzie, Karen L', 'Berguido, Francisco J', 'Moore, Malcolm A S', 'Nimer, Stephen D']","['Mulloy JC', 'Cammenga J', 'MacKenzie KL', 'Berguido FJ', 'Moore MA', 'Nimer SD']","['Laboratory of Molecular Hematopoiesis, Sloan-Kettering Institute, New York, NY, USA. j-mulloy@ski.mskcc.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (AML1-ETO fusion protein, human)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/analysis', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'Cytokines/pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/immunology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Luminescent Proteins/genetics', 'Mice', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/*physiology', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Stromal Cells/physiology', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*physiology', 'Transfection']",2002/01/05 10:00,2002/01/29 10:01,['2002/01/05 10:00'],"['2002/01/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/29 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/05 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2002 Jan 1;99(1):15-23. doi: 10.1182/blood.v99.1.15.,,"['10.1182/blood.v99.1.15 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)38375-0 [pii]']",,,,,,"['K01 CA090370/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K01 CA090370-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL61401/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK43025/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,

Optimal growth and DC characteristics were obtained with GM-CSF, FL, and SCF in 3-5 day cultures, suggesting a practical strategy for the immunotherapy of leukemia.","['Panoskaltsis, Nicki', 'Belanger, Todd J', 'Liesveld, Jane L', 'Abboud, Camille N']","['Panoskaltsis N', 'Belanger TJ', 'Liesveld JL', 'Abboud CN']","['The University of Rochester Medical Center, Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology/Oncology Unit, Box 610, Rochester, NY 14642, USA. n.panoskaltsis@ic.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-1)']",IM,['Leuk Res. 2002 Apr;26(4):409-10.

In pre-B cells, complete c-myb transcripts are produced, whereas transcripts are attenuated near or within a 300-base pair (bp) interval of the first c-myb intron in mature cells. Hypothesizing that transcription attenuation results from a protein complex that physically impedes the progress of RNA polymerase II through the intron, we used electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) to search for DNA-binding activities that correlated with downregulation of c-myb transcription. We identified a stage-specific DNA binding activity, termed ABF, present in mature B cells but not in pre-B cells. ABF binds to a 15-bp DNA element located within a 300-bp BstEII-XbaI fragment. DMSO-treatment of murine erythroleukemia cells results in rapid downregulation of c-myb transcription and upregulation of ABF DNA binding activity. Thus, ABF binding activity correlates with downregulation of c-myb transcription in two systems. Preliminary biochemical characterization of ABF from mature B cells demonstrates that its primary DNA-binding component is a 64-kDa-protein. We hypothesize that this factor may represent a member of the transcriptional attenuation complex.","['Perkel, Jeffrey M', 'Simon, M Celeste', 'Rao, Anjana']","['Perkel JM', 'Simon MC', 'Rao A']","['Abramson Family Cancer Research Institute, University of Pennsylvania, Room 456, BRB 11/111, 421 Curie Boulevard, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (c-myb attenuator-binding factor)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (RNA Polymerase II)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Blotting, Northern', 'DNA/genetics/*metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*isolation & purification/metabolism/physiology', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', '*Genes, myb', 'Introns', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/metabolism', 'Lipopolysaccharides/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Weight', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', '*Operon', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb/biosynthesis/genetics', 'RNA Polymerase II/metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism']",2002/01/05 10:00,2002/03/28 10:01,['2002/01/05 10:00'],"['2002/01/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/05 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2002 Feb;26(2):179-90. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(01)00101-1.,,"['S0145212601001011 [pii]', '10.1016/s0145-2126(01)00101-1 [doi]']",,,,,,"['CA42471/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM19556-01A1/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'HL52094/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,

While the role of this receptor and its ligand angiopoietin-1 (ang-1) during angiogenesis has been intensively studied before, little is known about their function in normal or malignant hematopoiesis. Recently several studies suggested that TEK plays an important role in the proliferation of primitive hematopoietic cells. We, therefore, analyzed blood cells of healthy donors and leukemia patients for expression of TEK and ang-1 by semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Northern blotting. We found an increased expression of the receptor and its ligand in 11 of 17 cases of acute and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) but not in four lymphocytic leukemias or five myeloid leukemias in remission. Abundant ang-1 message could also be detected in 4/6 myeloid and 1/9 cell lines of lymphocytic origin, but only one cell line co-expressed the TEK receptor, suggesting that ang-1 and TEK were probably expressed by different subsets of cells in the leukemic samples. Recently, several studies have indicated that angiogenic factors like ang-1 and vascular endothelial growth factor can enhance the proliferation of normal and malignant hematopoietic cells. The expression of both the TEK receptor and its ligand in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and CML patients might, therefore, suggest an involvement of these genes in the pathogenesis of myeloproliferative disorders.","['Muller, Anke', 'Lange, Karin', 'Gaiser, Timo', 'Hofmann, Manfred', 'Bartels, Heinrich', 'Feller, Alfred C', 'Merz, Hartmut']","['Muller A', 'Lange K', 'Gaiser T', 'Hofmann M', 'Bartels H', 'Feller AC', 'Merz H']","['Institut fur Pathologie, Universitatsklinikum Lubeck, Ratzeburger Allee 160, 23562 Lubeck, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Angiopoietin-1)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, TIE-2)']",IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Angiopoietin-1', 'Chronic Disease', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Receptor, TIE-2', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2002/01/05 10:00,2002/03/28 10:01,['2002/01/05 10:00'],"['2002/01/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/05 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2002 Feb;26(2):163-8. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(01)00110-2.,,"['S0145212601001102 [pii]', '10.1016/s0145-2126(01)00110-2 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Quantitative estimates of BCR-ABL transcripts were obtained by co-amplification with a competitor sequence. Estimates of ABL transcripts were used, an internal control and the ratio BCR-ABL/ABL was thus estimated for evaluating the kinetics of residual clones. Twenty four patients were followed shortly after BMT; two of these patients were in cytogenetic relapse coexisting with very high BCR-ABL levels while other 22 were in clinical, haematologic and cytogenetic remission 2-42 months after BMT. In this latter group, seven patients showed a favourable clinical-haematological progression in association with molecular remission while in 14 patients quantitative PCR assays indicated molecular relapse that was not associated with an early cytogenetic-haematologic relapse. BCR-ABL/ABL levels could not be correlated with presence of GVHD in 24 patients after BMT.

In this study, we examined cytokine production by macrophages during and after the phagocytosis of etoposide-treated P388 cells in vitro and in vivo. Etoposide caused apoptosis as early as 5 h after treatment, as assessed as to the exposure of phosphatidylserine, increase in membrane permeability and DNA ladder formation. Phagocytosis by phorbol myristate acetate (PMA)-treated THP-1 cells occurred marginally when P388 cells were treated with etoposide for 10 h, while it occurred significantly with P388 cells treated for 24 h, as evidenced by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy. PMA-treated THP-1 cells produced pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-1alpha, IL-8 and macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), but not anti-inflammatory cytokines among those tested at the mRNA level during and after the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells. IL-8 and MIF were also produced at the protein level, and the IL-8 production was dependent on cell-to-cell contact when the plasma membranes of apoptotic cells were intact enough not to leak one of the cytoplasmic enzymes, lactate dehydrogenase. In addition, etoposide-treated P388 cells induced neutrophil infiltration as well as MIP-2 production upon injection into the peritoneal cavity of either normal mice or mice with sterile peritonitis. When macrophages ingesting and/or binding apoptotic P388 cells were isolated from the mice with sterile peritonitis using a cell sorter, they were found to produce MIP-2 upon culture.","['Kawagishi, C', 'Kurosaka, K', 'Watanabe, N', 'Kobayashi, Y']","['Kawagishi C', 'Kurosaka K', 'Watanabe N', 'Kobayashi Y']","['Department of Biomolecular Science, Faculty of Science, Toho University, 2-2-1 Miyama, Chiba 274-8510, Funabashi, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL2)', '0 (Chemokines)', '0 (Cxcl2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-8)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '93674-97-6 (RGES peptide)', 'AC6UDA2MFC (arginyl-glycyl-aspartyl-serine)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis', 'Chemokine CXCL2', 'Chemokines/analysis', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Cytokines/analysis/*biosynthesis', 'Etoposide/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-8/analysis', 'Leukemia P388/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Macrophages/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Oligopeptides/pharmacology', 'Phagocytosis', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",2002/01/05 10:00,2002/02/16 10:01,['2002/01/05 10:00'],"['2002/01/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/16 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/05 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 2001 Dec 19;1541(3):221-30. doi: 10.1016/s0167-4889(01)00158-6.,,"['S0167488901001586 [pii]', '10.1016/s0167-4889(01)00158-6 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

However, its molecular mechanism of action is still obscure. The present study demonstrated that DADS induces apoptosis of human leukemia HL-60 cells in a concentration- and time-dependent manner with an IC50 for cell viability of less than 25 microM. DADS activated caspase-3 as evidenced by both the proteolytic cleavage of the proenzyme and increased protease activity. Activation of caspase-3 was maximal at 3 hr and led to the cleavage of 116 kDa poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), resulting in the accumulation of an 85 kDa cleavage product. Both activation of caspase-3 and cleavage of PARP were blocked by pretreatment with either antioxidants or a caspase-3 inhibitor, but not a caspase-1 inhibitor. DADS increased the production of intracellular hydrogen peroxide, which was blocked by preincubation with catalase. These results indicate that DADS-induced apoptosis is triggered by the generation of hydrogen peroxide, activation of caspase-3, degradation of PARP, and fragmentation of DNA. The induction of apoptosis by DADS may be the pivotal mechanism by which its chemopreventative action against cancer is based.","['Kwon, Kang-Beom', 'Yoo, Su-Jin', 'Ryu, Do-Gon', 'Yang, Jeong-Yeh', 'Rho, Hye-Won', 'Kim, Jong-Suk', 'Park, Jin-Woo', 'Kim, Hyung-Rho', 'Park, Byung-Hyun']","['Kwon KB', 'Yoo SJ', 'Ryu DG', 'Yang JY', 'Rho HW', 'Kim JS', 'Park JW', 'Kim HR', 'Park BH']","['Department of Physiology, School of Oriental Medicine, Wonkwang University, 570-749, Iksan, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Allyl Compounds)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Disulfides)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '5HI47O6OA7 (diallyl disulfide)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (PARP1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly (ADP-Ribose) Polymerase-1)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,,"['Allyl Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Disulfides/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Interactions', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia', 'Oxidative Stress/physiology', 'Poly (ADP-Ribose) Polymerase-1', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases', 'Proteins/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species']",2002/01/05 10:00,2002/01/24 10:01,['2002/01/05 10:00'],"['2002/01/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/24 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/05 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2002 Jan 1;63(1):41-7. doi: 10.1016/s0006-2952(01)00860-7.,,"['S0006295201008607 [pii]', '10.1016/s0006-2952(01)00860-7 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The number of hematopoietic stem cells in the body is thus a major factor in CML risk. Evidence suggests that the number of hematopoietic stem cells in the body is only loosely regulated, having a broad ""dead-band"" of physiologically acceptable values. The existence of a dead-band is important, because it would imply that low levels of hematopoietic stem cell killing can be permanent; i.e., it would imply that low doses of ionizing radiation can cause permanent reductions in the total number of CML target cells and thus permanent reductions in the subsequent risk of spontaneous CML. Such reductions in risk could be substantial if hematopoietic stem cells are also hypersensitive to radiation killing at low dose. Our calculations indicate that, due to dead-band hematopoietic stem cell control, if hematopoietic stem cells are as hypersensitive to killing at low doses as epithelial cells, reductions in the spontaneous CML risk could exceed the low-dose risks of induced CML; i.e., the net lifetime CML risk could have a U-shaped dose-response curve.","['Radivoyevitch, Tomas', 'Kozubek, Stanislav', 'Sachs, Rainer K']","['Radivoyevitch T', 'Kozubek S', 'Sachs RK']","['Department of Biometry and Epidemiology, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, South Carolina 29425, USA. radivot@hal.cwru.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Radiat Res,Radiation research,0401245,,IM,,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/radiation effects', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 22/radiation effects', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9/radiation effects', '*Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Genes, abl/radiation effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*radiation effects', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*epidemiology/etiology/pathology', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology/etiology/pathology', 'Middle Aged', '*Models, Biological', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Probability', 'Radiation Tolerance', 'Risk']",2002/01/05 10:00,2002/02/16 10:01,['2002/01/05 10:00'],"['2002/01/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/16 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/05 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Radiat Res. 2002 Jan;157(1):106-9. doi: 10.1667/0033-7587(2002)157[0106:trocml]2.0.co;2.,,['10.1667/0033-7587(2002)157[0106:trocml]2.0.co;2 [doi]'],,,,,,['CA86823/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,

Twenty-seven patients were treated: four with primary refractory AML, nine with AML in first relapse, four with AML in second relapse, and 10 with MDS-RAEB/RAEBT. Patients received as salvage therapy a single course of idarubicin 12 mg/m(2) IV bolus on days 1-3, cytarabine 1 g/m(2) over two hours q 12 hr on days 1-5, and topotecan 1.25 mg/m(2) over 24 hr on days 1-5. Median age was 42 years (range 17-65 years). All patients were evaluable for response: 14 (51.9%) achieved complete remission, 10 with AML (59%) and four with MDS (40%), respectively. Thirteen AML patients (excluding four relapsed after autologous stem cell transplantation) were grouped into four categories to stratify the probability of achieving complete remission (CR): group 1, first CR duration > or = 2 years and receiving first salvage treatment (S1); group 2, first CR duration 1-2 years and receiving S1; group 3, first CR duration 0-1 years and receiving S1; and group 4, first CR duration 0-1 years and receiving S2, S3, or S4 after failing S1. The response rate of each group was as follows: group 1, one of two (50%); group 2, one of one (100%); group 3, four of four (100%); group 4, two of six (33.3%). The median remission duration and survival of patients with AML were six and 12 months, respectively. Median duration of survival in 10 MDS patients was 15 months, and all four MDS patients achieving a CR maintained continuous CR with a median follow-up of 11 months. Severe myelosuppression was observed in all patients, resulting in fever or documented infections in 89% of patients.

The patients were divided into three diagnostic categories: proven aspergillosis (autoptic or histologic diagnosis) n = 39, probable aspergillosis (radiological diagnosis with positive microbiology) n = 9, and possible aspergillosis (radiological diagnosis alone) n = 13. In the same period among 675 acute leukemia patients the incidence of proven or probable aspergillosis was 7.1%. At onset of infection 92% of patients were neutropenic (< 0.5 x 10(9)/L). The most frequent site of infection was the lung (90%); disseminated disease was present in 20 patients. Among 44 assessable patients, 12 (27%) failed to respond to early antifungal therapy and died. Thirty-two patients were cured with antifungal treatment, three of five nonneutropenic with only itraconazole, the others with amphotericin B 1 mg/Kg/day with or without itraconazole subsequently or with liposomal amphotericin, Ambisome, if renal toxicity occurred. Twenty-four of 29 neutropenic responders, all affected by acute leukemia, continued scheduled intensive chemotherapies. Pulmonary lobectomy was successfully combined with medical treatment in two cases before scheduled BMT. After infection nine patients were submitted to BMT (six allo, one marrow unrelated donor (MUD), two auto) with Ambisome or itraconazole as secondary prophylaxis without fungal relapse (follow-up: 25-99 months). The median time from fungal infection to transplant was five months, range 3-10. Thirteen of 29 surviving patients had leukemia relapse, but only three (23%) of these showed also fungal infection recurrence. In conclusion, a high index of suspicion and careful clinical and radiological examinations are the key to identifying infected patients early and to programming the following therapeutic steps. Above all in leukemia patients, prompt and aggressive administration of antifungal agents seems to improve the outcome of invasive fungal disease and to permit intensive chemotherapy completion and transplant.","['Nosari, A', 'Oreste, P', 'Cairoli, R', 'Montillo, M', 'Carrafiello, G', 'Astolfi, A', 'Muti, G', 'Marbello, L', 'Tedeschi, A', 'Magliano, E', 'Morra, E']","['Nosari A', 'Oreste P', 'Cairoli R', 'Montillo M', 'Carrafiello G', 'Astolfi A', 'Muti G', 'Marbello L', 'Tedeschi A', 'Magliano E', 'Morra E']","[""Department of Haematology, Niguarda Ca' Granda Hospital, Milan, Italy.

Further studies have suggested that this point mutation, together with additional mutations in the precore promoter, is probably linked to the reactivation of HBV in patients undergoing cytotoxic chemotherapy. Taiwan is an area with a high prevalence of HBV where hepatitis B flare-up has become a serious problem of HBV carriers who must rely on chemotherapy to treat their diseases. The purpose of this study was to examine if nt 1896 mutation was also present in Chinese patients in Taiwan who developed severe liver disease after chemotherapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS.

They all received steroid-containing regimens or antiemetics during chemotherapy. These patients were monitored closely for the development of severe hepatitis during or after chemotherapy. Their sera were harvested at different times for direct sequencing of the polymerase chain reaction products of the precore region of HBV DNA. RESULTS: Six of the 13 patients developed severe hepatitis with a fulminant course during or after the completion of chemotherapy. A point mutation from G to A at nt 1896 was detected in five of these six patients. Among those five patients, four had additional precore mutations. The other patient did not have the nt 1896 mutation but had mutations at nt 1835 (A to C). None of the other seven patients lacking the precore nt 1896 mutation developed severe hepatitis flare-up. One of those seven patients who developed moderate elevation of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) without hyperbilirubinemia did have precore mutations other than nt 1896. None of the other six patients had mutations over the precore region. CONCLUSIONS: Nucleotide mutation of the precore region, notably at position 1896, is associated with reactivation of HBV with a fulminant course during or after chemotherapy. The current data, together with other investigators' findings, suggest that patients who are HBV carriers with HBV envelope antigen (HBeAg) (-)/anti-HBV envelope antibody (Anti-HBe)(+) status should be assayed to determine if they carry mutant HBV before chemotherapy. Prophylactic use of lamivudine is strongly recommended for patients who carry mutant HBV at precore region, especially at nt 1896 (G to A), before and during chemotherapy.","['Dai, M S', 'Lu, J J', 'Chen, Y C', 'Perng, C L', 'Chao, T Y']","['Dai MS', 'Lu JJ', 'Chen YC', 'Perng CL', 'Chao TY']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, Tri-Service General Hospital, National Defense Medical Center, Taipei, Taiwan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions', 'Female', 'Hepatitis B/epidemiology/etiology/*virology', 'Hepatitis B virus/drug effects/*genetics/growth & development/physiology', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma/complications/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Taiwan/epidemiology', 'Virus Activation/*genetics']",2001/12/26 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/12/26 10:00'],"['2001/12/26 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/12/26 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer. 2001 Dec 1;92(11):2927-32. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(20011201)92:11<2927::aid-cncr10109>3.0.co;2-w.,,"['10.1002/1097-0142(20011201)92:11<2927::AID-CNCR10109>3.0.CO;2-W [pii]', '10.1002/1097-0142(20011201)92:11<2927::aid-cncr10109>3.0.co;2-w [doi]']",,,,['Copyright 2001 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,,

There are two isoforms of PKA that are distinguished by two types of R subunit, RI and RII. Evidence suggests that RI is associated with proliferation and RII is associated with cell differentiation. Previous work in this laboratory has demonstrated that depletion of the RIalpha subunit by treatment with an antisense oligonucleotide (ODN) induces differentiation in leukemia cells and growth arrest and apoptosis in epithelial cancer cells. Using the prostate cancer cell line PC3M as a model system, we have developed a cell line that overexpresses a retroviral vector construct containing the RIalpha antisense gene. This cell line has been characterized and the effectiveness of the construct determined. In the work presented here, we demonstrate by immunocytochemistry that treatment with RIalpha antisense ODN induces translocation of the Calpha subunit of PKA to the nucleus of PC3M prostate cancer cells. The translocation of Calpha triggered by exogenous antisense ODN treatment mirrors that observed in cells endogenously overexpressing the antisense gene. Triggering the nuclear translocation of the Calpha subunit of PKA in the cell may be an important mechanism of action of RIalpha antisense that regulates cell growth independent of adenylate cyclase and cellular cAMP levels. The nuclear localization of the Calpha subunit of PKA may be an essential step in revealing the mechanism whereby this critical kinase regulates cell growth.","['Neary, C L', 'Cho-Chung, Y S']","['Neary CL', 'Cho-Chung YS']","['Cellular Biochemistry Section, Basic Research Laboratories, The Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, MD 20892-1750, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinase RIalpha Subunit)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (PRKAR1A protein, human)', '0 (Protein Subunits)', '1F7A44V6OU (Colforsin)', 'EC 2.7.11.11 (Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases)']",IM,,"['Active Transport, Cell Nucleus/drug effects', '*Catalytic Domain', 'Cell Nucleus/drug effects/enzymology/*metabolism', 'Colforsin/pharmacology', 'Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinase RIalpha Subunit', 'Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases/*chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/genetics/*pharmacology', 'Protein Subunits', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/12/26 10:00,2002/01/11 10:01,['2001/12/26 10:00'],"['2001/04/25 00:00 [received]', '2001/08/22 00:00 [revised]', '2001/09/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2001/12/26 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/11 10:01 [medline]', '2001/12/26 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2001 Nov 29;20(55):8019-24. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1204992.,,['10.1038/sj.onc.1204992 [doi]'],,,,,,['N02-BC-76212/BC/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,

We have prospectively analyzed the clinical impact of recipient-derived chimeric cells in 30 patients with acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome after SCT. In order to improve sensitivity and specificity, all samples were cell-separated by using immunomagnetic beads according to the patient's leukemia phenotype, expressed at diagnosis or relapse before SCT. Twelve out of 30 patients experienced a clinical relapse after SCT. Median follow-up time for patients alive and without relapse (n = 15) was 30 (16-47) months. Mixed chimerism in peripheral blood (PB) and bone marrow (BM) > or =1 month post SCT, in the leukemia-affected cell lineage, was detected in 14/30 patients. Ten of these 14 patients relapsed as compared to 2/16 with donor chimerism (DC) (P <0.01). All eight patients with MC in peripheral blood > or =1 month after SCT relapsed vs 4/22 DC patients (P < 0.001). MC was detected a median of 66 (23-332) days before hematological relapse. No correlation was found between T cell MC and relapse. In this study, chimerism analysis showed a higher sensitivity and specificity vs morphological examination. In conclusion, this study may provide a rational basis for treatment with adoptive immunotherapy at an earlier time after SCT than at present, in patients with AML and MDS, in order to treat recurrences of malignant disease.","['Mattsson, J', 'Uzunel, M', 'Tammik, L', 'Aschan, J', 'Ringden, O']","['Mattsson J', 'Uzunel M', 'Tammik L', 'Aschan J', 'Ringden O']","['Center for Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation, Huddinge University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cell Separation/methods', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*standards', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/diagnosis/*pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/diagnosis/*pathology/therapy', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Recurrence', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', '*Transplantation Chimera/immunology', 'Transplantation, Homologous/standards']",2001/12/26 10:00,2002/01/23 10:01,['2001/12/26 10:00'],"['2000/11/08 00:00 [received]', '2001/05/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2001/12/26 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/23 10:01 [medline]', '2001/12/26 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2001 Dec;15(12):1976-85. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402311.,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2402311 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

For assays with clinical applications, these controls may be difficult to obtain because some molecular aberrations are rare and patient material may be available in limited amounts. Because of the risk of introducing contaminations in the laboratory, cloned DNA is not a desirable alternative. We describe the use of dU-containing DNA as a positive control template in real-time quantitative PCR. dU-DNA constructs can be decontaminated by adding uracil N-glycosylase (UNG) to the reaction mixture. In addition, dU-DNA can be used for accurate quantification, because it allows quantification to be expressed in numbers of molecules. Since synthetic dU-DNA constructs can easily be quantitated spectroscopically, they provide a more accurate control than arbitrary cell line units. We applied this method for the detection of the E2A-Pbx1 gene fusion and show that UNG-containing reactions can be employed for diagnostics without loss of sensitivity, and that for positive and quantitative controls UNG negative reactions can be used. The use of dU-DNA provides a novel type of control template that can easily be integrated into existing PCR protocols.","['Pennings, J L', 'Van De Locht, L T', 'Jansen, J H', 'Van der Reijden, B A', 'De Witte, T', 'Mensink, E J']","['Pennings JL', 'Van De Locht LT', 'Jansen JH', 'Van der Reijden BA', 'De Witte T', 'Mensink EJ']","['Central Hematology Laboratory, University Medical Center St Radboud Nijmegen, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Validation Study']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Deoxyuracil Nucleotides)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '146150-85-8 (E2A-Pbx1 fusion protein)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 3.2.2.- (DNA Glycosylases)', 'EC 3.2.2.- (N-Glycosyl Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.2.2.- (Uracil-DNA Glycosidase)']",IM,,"['DNA/chemistry/metabolism/*standards', '*DNA Glycosylases', 'Deoxyuracil Nucleotides/analysis/metabolism', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics', 'Humans', 'N-Glycosyl Hydrolases/metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*standards', 'Reference Standards', 'Uracil-DNA Glycosidase']",2001/12/26 10:00,2002/01/23 10:01,['2001/12/26 10:00'],"['2001/04/12 00:00 [received]', '2001/07/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2001/12/26 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/23 10:01 [medline]', '2001/12/26 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2001 Dec;15(12):1962-5. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402290.,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2402290 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Since vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) are two key mediators of angiogenesis, we characterized the production of VEGF, b-FGF and interleukin-6 (IL-6) (a MM growth and survival factor) in MM cell lines and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) transformed B cell lines from MM patients, patient MM cells, as well as bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) from normal healthy donors and MM patients. We detected secretion of VEGF, but no bFGF and IL-6, in MM cell lines (MM.1S, RPMI 8226 and U266); EBV transformed B cell lines from MM patients (IM-9, HS-Sultan and ARH77); MM cell lines resistant to doxorubicin (RPMI-DOX40), mitoxantrone (RPMI-MR20), melphalan (RPMI-LR5) and dexamethasone (MM.1R); and patient MM cells (MM1 and MM2). BMSCs from MM patients and normal donors secreted VEGF, b-FGF and IL-6. Importantly, when MM cells were adhered to BMSCs, there was a significant increase in VEGF (1.5- to 3.1-fold) and IL-6 (1.9- to 56-fold) secretion. In contrast, the bFGF decreased in co-cultures of BMSCs and MM cells. Paraformaldehyde fixation of BMSCs or MM cells prior to adhesion revealed that VEGF was produced both from BMSCs and MM cells, though it may come primarily from BMSCs in some cultures. IL-6 was produced exclusively in BMSCs, rather than MM cells. Moreover, when MM cells were placed in Transwell insert chambers to allow their juxtaposition to BMSCs without cell to cell contact, induction of VEGF and IL-6 secretion persisted, suggesting the importance of humoral factors. Addition of exogenous IL-6 (10 ng/ml) increased VEGF secretion by BMSCs. Conversely, VEGF (100 ng/ml) significantly increased IL-6 secretion by BMSCs. Moreover, anti-human VEGF (1 microg/ml) and anti-human IL-6 (10 microg/ml) neutralizing antibodies reduced IL-6 and VEGF secretion, respectively, in cultures of BMSCs alone and co-cultures of BMSCs and MM cells. Finally, thalidomide (100 microM) and its immunomodulatory analog IMiD1-CC4047 (1 microM) decreased the upregulation of IL-6 and VEGF secretion in cultures of BMSCs, MM cells and co-cultures of BMSCs with MM cells. These data demonstrate the importance of stromal-MM cell interactions in regulating VEGF and IL-6 secretion, and suggest additional mechanisms whereby thalidomide and IMiD1-CC4047 act against MM cells in the BM millieu.","['Gupta, D', 'Treon, S P', 'Shima, Y', 'Hideshima, T', 'Podar, K', 'Tai, Y T', 'Lin, B', 'Lentzsch, S', 'Davies, F E', 'Chauhan, D', 'Schlossman, R L', 'Richardson, P', 'Ralph, P', 'Wu, L', 'Payvandi, F', 'Muller, G', 'Stirling, D I', 'Anderson, K C']","['Gupta D', 'Treon SP', 'Shima Y', 'Hideshima T', 'Podar K', 'Tai YT', 'Lin B', 'Lentzsch S', 'Davies FE', 'Chauhan D', 'Schlossman RL', 'Richardson P', 'Ralph P', 'Wu L', 'Payvandi F', 'Muller G', 'Stirling DI', 'Anderson KC']","['Department of Adult Oncology, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Angiogenesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Endothelial Growth Factors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors)', '103107-01-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 2)', '4Z8R6ORS6L (Thalidomide)']",IM,,"['Angiogenesis Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology/physiology', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Communication/physiology', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Drug Interactions', 'Endothelial Growth Factors/*metabolism', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 2/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/metabolism', 'Lymphokines/*metabolism', 'Multiple Myeloma/metabolism/*pathology/physiopathology', 'Stromal Cells/*cytology/metabolism/physiology', 'Thalidomide/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Up-Regulation', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors']",2001/12/26 10:00,2002/01/23 10:01,['2001/12/26 10:00'],"['2001/01/25 00:00 [received]', '2001/07/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2001/12/26 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/23 10:01 [medline]', '2001/12/26 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2001 Dec;15(12):1950-61. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402295.,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2402295 [doi]'],,,,,,['P0-1 78378/PHS HHS/United States'],,,,,,

Thirty-two patients have been treated: 14 at disease onset and 18 with relapsed or progressive disease. R-HDS regimens included six courses of rituximab. Rituximab was delivered either concurrently with high-dose chemotherapy to exploit the in vivo purging properties of the drug as well as at the end of the treatment plan to target minimal residual disease. All patients treated at disease onset completed their treatment with no life-threatening toxicity, while two toxic deaths due to severe bilateral pneumonia were observed among patients treated due to relapsed or refractory disease. Thirteen of 14 patients treated up-front achieved CR. Among pre-treated patients 10 of 18 achieved CR with better results in patients with relapsed (seven of eight) compared to progressive disease (three of 10). PCR analysis was carried out in indolent lymphoma patients: nine of nine follicular lymphomas and three of six CD5-positive NHL collected PCR-negative peripheral blood progenitor cell harvests. The results of this pilot study show that R-HDS is feasible and effective with acceptable toxicity when used at disease onset.

Furthermore, enforced over-expression of SKAP55R in primary bone marrow cells inhibited colony growth. In this study, we have identified the cis-acting elements that control SKAP55R transcription in myeloid cells. The 980 bp genomic sequence upstream of the transcriptional start site was cloned into a GFP reporter vector for transient (293 cells) or stable (M1 cells) transfection assays. This region contained cis-acting elements necessary for transcriptional activity in unstimulated 293 cells (10-fold higher levels than the control vector) or unstimulated M1 cells (two-fold higher levels). Significant LIF-induced transcription was observed in M1 (3.4-fold induction, P < 0.001), but not 293 cells. Deletion reporter constructs defined a promoter region (-317/-137) essential for the transcriptional activity in M1 cells. This region contained a CCAAT element recently implicated in IL-6/LIF-induced transcriptional regulation of junB in M1 cells. Mutation of the CCAAT element (-250/-246) significantly reduced both basal and LIF-induced transcription (P < 0.01). Electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated that NF-Y bound to the CCAAT element of both SKAP55R and junB. These results suggest NF-Y binding may be a common mechanism of IL-6/LIF-regulated transcription in myeloid cells.","['Curtis, D J', 'Dougherty, L', 'Bodine, D M']","['Curtis DJ', 'Dougherty L', 'Bodine DM']","['Genetics and Molecular Biology Branch, National Human Genome Research Institute, Bethesda, MD, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (CCAAT-Binding Factor)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (src kinase associated phosphoprotein 2)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'CCAAT-Binding Factor/*pharmacology', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/pharmacology', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Myeloid Cells/*metabolism', 'Phosphoproteins/*genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/drug effects/genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic/*drug effects', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/12/26 10:00,2002/01/23 10:01,['2001/12/26 10:00'],"['2001/04/04 00:00 [received]', '2001/07/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2001/12/26 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/23 10:01 [medline]', '2001/12/26 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2001 Dec;15(12):1932-40. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402286.,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2402286 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Constitutive STAT5 phosphorylation was observed in 18 of 26 (69%) patients with AML. The constitutive STAT5 phosphorylation was caused by different mechanisms. In the majority of the investigated cases (71% (12 of 17)) constitutive STAT5 phosphorylation was associated with autophosphorylation of the type III receptor tyrosine kinase Flt3. In 47% (eight of 17) of these cases autophosphorylation of Flt3 coincided with tandem duplications of the Flt3 gene, resulting in constitutive phosphorylation of the receptor, while 24% (four of 17) of the cases demonstrated STAT5 phosphorylation and Flt3 autophosphorylation without mutations. In addition, a subset of AML cases (29% (five of 17)) had no autophosphorylation of the Flt3 receptor, but demonstrated constitutive STAT5 phosphorylation, which was partly due to autocrine growth factor production. All AML cases with high STAT5 and Flt3 phosphorylation demonstrated, in general, a lower percentage of spontaneous apoptosis, compared to AML blasts with no spontaneous STAT5 phosphorylation. Addition of the receptor tyrosine III kinase inhibitor AG1296 strongly inhibited STAT5 phosphorylation and enhanced the percentage of apoptotic cells without modulating the Bcl-xl protein levels. These data indicate that in the majority of AML cases the constitutive STAT5 phosphorylation is caused by Flt3 phosphorylation mostly due to mutations in the receptors and associated with a low degree of spontaneous apoptosis.","['Birkenkamp, K U', 'Geugien, M', 'Lemmink, H H', 'Kruijer, W', 'Vellenga, E']","['Birkenkamp KU', 'Geugien M', 'Lemmink HH', 'Kruijer W', 'Vellenga E']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Milk Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Gene Duplication', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/etiology/metabolism/*pathology', '*Milk Proteins', 'Mutation', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor', 'Trans-Activators/*metabolism', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3']",2001/12/26 10:00,2002/01/23 10:01,['2001/12/26 10:00'],"['2001/03/20 00:00 [received]', '2001/08/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2001/12/26 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/23 10:01 [medline]', '2001/12/26 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2001 Dec;15(12):1923-31. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402317.,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2402317 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

WT1 is also highly expressed in most cases of acute myeloid leukemia. Moreover, WT1 can interfere with induced differentiation of leukemic cell lines. These data suggest a function of WT1 in the maintenance of a primitive phenotype and a role in leukemogenesis by interfering with differentiation, prompting us to investigate its function in human hematopoietic progenitor cells. By retroviral transfer, human CD34(+) cord blood progenitor cells were transduced with a vector encoding either of two splicing variants of WT1, with or without the KTS insert in the zinc-finger domain, linked to expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP) via an internal ribosomal entry site. When compared to cells transduced with vector containing GFP only, WT1 expressing cells showed strongly reduced colony formation in methylcellulose and inhibited proliferation in suspension culture, with no apparent reduction in viability. Cell cycle phase distribution was not affected by WT1 expression. No signs of impaired differentiation, as judged by the surface markers CD11b, CD14 and glycophorin were detected. In contrast to the results with human CD34(+) progenitor cells, the proliferation of murine bone marrow cells was not significantly affected by WT1, consistent with previous data. We conclude that forced expression of WT1 in highly enriched human hematopoietic progenitor cells leads to strong anti-proliferative effects but is compatible with induced maturation of these cells.","['Svedberg, H', 'Richter, J', 'Gullberg, U']","['Svedberg H', 'Richter J', 'Gullberg U']","['Department of Hematology, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/*blood', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/*drug effects', 'Fetal Blood/cytology', 'Gene Expression/physiology', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Myeloid Progenitor Cells/cytology/drug effects', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'WT1 Proteins/*genetics']",2001/12/26 10:00,2002/01/23 10:01,['2001/12/26 10:00'],"['2000/11/28 00:00 [received]', '2001/08/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2001/12/26 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/23 10:01 [medline]', '2001/12/26 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2001 Dec;15(12):1914-22. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402303.,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2402303 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Reciprocal translocations were sequenced for seven of the 19 samples. We assumed a null hypothesis that the translocation breakpoints would be evenly distributed along the intronic breakpoint cluster regions. Testing for multimodality via smoothed bootstrap statistical methods suggested, however, the presence of two separate cluster regions within both the AML1 and ETO breakpoint cluster regions. ETObreakpoints were predominantly located in intron 1B in a defined cluster 5' of exon 1A (scan statistic P value = 0.00001). All patients with available RNA expressed an AML1-ETO mRNA fusion between exon 5 of AML1 and exon 2 of ETO.

We investigated the in vivo clonality and mutational spectra of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) mutations in T cells from children with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) to gain insight into the mutagenic mechanisms associated with leukemogenesis. We observed several instances of multiple, independent HPRT mutations accumulating in vivo in T cell receptor (TCR) gene defined clones that had undergone extensive pre- and/or post-thymic expansion following chemotherapy. In addition, we also detected the accumulation of multiple unique single mutations within distinct expanding post-thymic T cell clones.

These observations provide a paradigm for a continuum of cellular events that eventually results in the clonal accumulation of mutations in selected populations of cells in vivo and may provide insight into the primary genetic events associated with leukemogenesis, as well as the development of second malignancies and drug resistance following chemotherapy.","['Finette, B A', 'Homans, A C', 'Rivers, J', 'Messier, T', 'Albertini, R J']","['Finette BA', 'Homans AC', 'Rivers J', 'Messier T', 'Albertini RJ']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Vermont, Burlington, VT 05405, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,['EC 2.4.2.8 (Hypoxanthine Phosphoribosyltransferase)'],IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage', 'Cell Division/physiology', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Clone Cells/enzymology/metabolism/pathology', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Female', 'Genes, T-Cell Receptor beta/genetics', 'Humans', 'Hypoxanthine Phosphoribosyltransferase/genetics', 'Leukemia/enzymology/etiology/*genetics', 'Lymphocyte Activation/genetics', 'Male', '*Mutation', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/enzymology/etiology/genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/enzymology/metabolism/*pathology']",2001/12/26 10:00,2002/01/23 10:01,['2001/12/26 10:00'],"['2001/04/12 00:00 [received]', '2001/08/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2001/12/26 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/23 10:01 [medline]', '2001/12/26 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2001 Dec;15(12):1898-905. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402306.,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2402306 [doi]'],,,,,,"['1K01CA77737NCI/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1R29HD35309/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'P30CA22435/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,

Patients were diagnosed according to the French-American-British (FAB) classification as follows: M0 (n = 12), M1 (n = 16), M2 (n = 53), M4 (n = 17), M5 (n = 19) and M7 (n = 15). The results revealed that, compared to leukemic cells from complete-responders (n = 107), those from non-responders who failed induction therapy (n = 17) were 1.4 to 5.0 times more resistant in vitro to cytarabine (P = 0.005), melphalan (P = 0.003), etoposide (P = 0.011), L-asparaginase (P = 0.017), aclarubicin (P = 0.026) and dexamethasone (P = 0.039). For seven other drugs tested, the median lethal dose of 70% and leukemic cell survival of non-responders were higher than those of complete-responders, but the difference was not statistically significant. We sought correlations between FAB subtypes and in vitro drug resistance. Leukemias of the FAB M4 and M5 subtype were more sensitive to L-asparaginase (P = 0.01, P = 0.0036) than those of the FAB M2 subtype. FAB M5 leukemia was more sensitive to etoposide than were the FAB M2, M4 and M7 subtypes (P = 0.001, P = 0.034, P = 0.023, respectively). By contrast, FAB M5 leukemia was significantly more resistant to prednisolone and dexamethasone than were the FAB M0, M1, M2, M4 and M7 subtypes. We sought correlations between in vitro drug resistance and long-term clinical outcome, but found no associations in this case. These results suggest that in vitro resistance to cytarabine, melphalan, etoposide, L-asparaginase, aclarubicin and dexamethasone might represent factors that can predict response to the early course of therapy. Selecting an appropriate anti-cancer drug according to the FAB classification together with drug sensitivity testing may contribute to improved prognoses in childhood acute myeloid leukemia.","['Yamada, S', 'Hongo, T', 'Okada, S', 'Watanabe, C', 'Fujii, Y', 'Ohzeki, T']","['Yamada S', 'Hongo T', 'Okada S', 'Watanabe C', 'Fujii Y', 'Ohzeki T']","['Department of Pediatrics, Hamamatsu University School of Medicine, Hamamatsu, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/classification/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",2001/12/26 10:00,2002/01/23 10:01,['2001/12/26 10:00'],"['2000/12/13 00:00 [received]', '2001/08/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2001/12/26 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/23 10:01 [medline]', '2001/12/26 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2001 Dec;15(12):1892-7. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402305.,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2402305 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Since factors responsible for poor response to platelet transfusions in this clinical setting are largely unknown, we performed a prospective study in 87 consecutive children transplanted in a single institution. The mean 16-h corrected count increment (CCI) of 598 platelet transfusions was 5.76 +/- 8.32 x 10(9)/l. Both before and after HSCT, 13.8% of patients had antibodies against HLA and/or platelet-specific antigens. Univariate analysis identified 12 factors significantly associated with a lower post-transfusion CCI, but only four reached statistical significance in the multivariate analysis. These four factors were concomitant therapy with vancomycin, alloimmunization, use of an Autopheresis cell separator for preparation of platelet concentrates and cytomegalovirus infection. We, therefore, suggest that a better response to platelet transfusions could be obtained by choosing a suitable cell separator, by avoiding the use of vancomycin and by adopting measures that reduce alloimmunization and CMV infection. Moreover, screening patients for HLA and platelet-specific antibodies before HSCT would identify the majority of subjects who will develop alloimmune refractoriness after transplantation and would allow the search for a compatible donor in advance.","['Balduini, C L', 'Salvaneschi, L', 'Klersy, C', 'Noris, P', 'Mazzucco, M', 'Rizzuto, F', 'Giorgiani, G', 'Perotti, C', 'Stroppa, P', 'Pumpo, M D', 'Nobili, B', 'Locatelli, F']","['Balduini CL', 'Salvaneschi L', 'Klersy C', 'Noris P', 'Mazzucco M', 'Rizzuto F', 'Giorgiani G', 'Perotti C', 'Stroppa P', 'Pumpo MD', 'Nobili B', 'Locatelli F']","['Department of Internal Medicine, IRCCS San Matteo-University of Pavia, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Antigens, Human Platelet)', '0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (Isoantibodies)', '6Q205EH1VU (Vancomycin)']",IM,,"['Analysis of Variance', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Antigens, Human Platelet/immunology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Contraindications', 'Cytapheresis/instrumentation', 'Cytomegalovirus Infections/blood/complications', 'Female', 'HLA Antigens/immunology', 'Hematologic Diseases/therapy', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Isoantibodies/blood', 'Male', 'Platelet Count', 'Platelet Transfusion/*standards', 'Prospective Studies', 'Transplantation Immunology', 'Transplantation, Homologous/immunology', 'Vancomycin/adverse effects/therapeutic use']",2001/12/26 10:00,2002/01/23 10:01,['2001/12/26 10:00'],"['2001/06/29 00:00 [received]', '2001/08/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2001/12/26 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/23 10:01 [medline]', '2001/12/26 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2001 Dec;15(12):1885-91. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402307.,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2402307 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Alternative treatments, such as transplantation with other family donors, are an option for patients without HLA-identical siblings. This study evaluated transplantation with genotypically nonidentical family donors and compared the results to those obtained with unrelated donors and autologous stem cell transplantation. Overall 3-year survival was 35% for the 79 patients transplanted using genotypically nonidentical donors, DFS was 31%, relapse risk 16%, and the treatment-related mortality (TRM) 62%. Patients transplanted using phenotypically identical family donors had a significantly superior survival and a lower TRM than patients transplanted with mismatched family donors. Age had no influence on the outcome of transplantation. The DFS of patients transplanted in early stage of the disease was 42% compared to 28% in patients transplanted with more advanced disease (P = 0.03). The results of transplantation with mismatched family donors were comparable to those obtained with unrelated donor transplantation. This suggests that nonidentical family donors may be considered if a fully matched unrelated donor is not available. The TRM of patients transplanted with nonidentical family donors is significantly higher than the TRM of patients transplanted with autologous stem cells. The disease-free survival of ASCT is not inferior to allogeneic transplantation using nonidentical family donors, and the intensity of the treatment is much lower. The choice of ASCT or alternative donor transplantation must be influenced by the age of the patient and the risk of relapse. For patients under the age of 20 years the treatment of choice may indeed be an alternative donor transplantation.","['de Witte, T', 'Pikkemaat, F', 'Hermans, J', 'van Biezen, A', 'Mackinnan, S', 'Cornelissen, J', 'Gratwohl, A', 'Delforge, M', 'Iriondo, A', 'Kuentz, M', 'Harousseau, J', 'Fauser, A', 'Wandt, H', 'Runde, V', 'Niederwieser, D', 'Apperley, J']","['de Witte T', 'Pikkemaat F', 'Hermans J', 'van Biezen A', 'Mackinnan S', 'Cornelissen J', 'Gratwohl A', 'Delforge M', 'Iriondo A', 'Kuentz M', 'Harousseau J', 'Fauser A', 'Wandt H', 'Runde V', 'Niederwieser D', 'Apperley J']","['Department of Hematology, University Medical Center St Radboud, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*immunology/mortality', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Genotype', 'Histocompatibility/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/mortality/*therapy', 'Nuclear Family', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Analysis', 'Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation, Autologous/mortality']",2001/12/26 10:00,2002/01/23 10:01,['2001/12/26 10:00'],"['2001/06/26 00:00 [received]', '2001/07/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2001/12/26 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/23 10:01 [medline]', '2001/12/26 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2001 Dec;15(12):1878-84. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402296.,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2402296 [doi]'],"['EBMT, CLWP-MDS subcommittee']",,,,,,,,,,,

In order to investigate the therapeutic potential of TRAIL in B chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) we have analyzed the expression of TRAIL receptors (TRAIL-Rs) in leukemic cells from B-CLL patients and their in vitro sensitivity to apoptosis induced by recombinant human TRAIL. We have found TRAIL-R1 and -R2 death receptor, and TRAIL-R3 and -R4 decoy receptor mRNA expression in most of the 57 B-CLL patients studied (R1 82%, R2 100%, R3 96% and R4 82%). TRAIL-R1 and R2 proteins were expressed on the surface and within the cells, whereas R3 and R4 decoy receptors were almost exclusively expressed in the cytoplasm. Despite TRAIL death receptor expression, B-CLL cells were relatively resistant to induction of apoptosis by recombinant human TRAIL (300 ng/ml). However, the susceptibility to TRAIL-induced apoptosis was increased by treatment of B-CLL cells with actinomycin D (Act D). Western blot analysis showed higher constitutive expression of the long form of FLICE-inhibitory protein (FLIP(L)) in B-CLL as compared to normal tonsillar B cells. Act D treatment down-regulated both long and short FLIP expression, which was correlated with the increase in B-CLL sensitivity to TRAIL. Although the surface TRAIL death receptor expression was up-regulated both by cell culture and by Act D treatment, the changes were not correlated with a gain in susceptibility to TRAIL. In addition, neither decoy receptors nor Bcl-2 expression were affected by Act D. Our findings suggest the possible involvement of FLIP in regulating TRAIL-mediated apoptosis in B-CLL.","['Olsson, A', 'Diaz, T', 'Aguilar-Santelises, M', 'Osterborg, A', 'Celsing, F', 'Jondal, M', 'Osorio, L M']","['Olsson A', 'Diaz T', 'Aguilar-Santelises M', 'Osterborg A', 'Celsing F', 'Jondal M', 'Osorio LM']","['Microbiology and Tumor Biology Center, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (CASP8 and FADD-Like Apoptosis Regulating Protein)', '0 (CFLAR protein, human)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (GPI-Linked Proteins)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Member 10c)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNFRSF10A protein, human)', '0 (TNFRSF10B protein, human)', '0 (TNFRSF10C protein, human)', '0 (TNFSF10 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor Decoy Receptors)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)']",IM,,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'CASP8 and FADD-Like Apoptosis Regulating Protein', 'Carrier Proteins/*drug effects', 'Dactinomycin/*pharmacology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'GPI-Linked Proteins', 'Humans', '*Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/genetics/*pharmacology', 'Middle Aged', 'RNA, Messenger/drug effects/metabolism', 'Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/metabolism', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Member 10c', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Decoy Receptors', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/genetics/*pharmacology']",2001/12/26 10:00,2002/01/23 10:01,['2001/12/26 10:00'],"['2000/09/11 00:00 [received]', '2001/07/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2001/12/26 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/23 10:01 [medline]', '2001/12/26 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2001 Dec;15(12):1868-77. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402287.,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2402287 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

In all the patients studied (n = 25) the presence of accessory leukocytes markedly prolonged the survival of B-CLL cells. The anti-apoptotic effect was exerted by monocytes and, to a lesser degree, NK cells, partially through the release of soluble factors. Indeed, accessory leukocytes separated from leukemic cells by semipermeable membranes were still able to prolong B-CLL cell survival. By flow cytometric analysis we found that the protective effect of non-malignant cells was associated with delayed down-regulation of Bcl-2 expression on leukemic cells.

All FLT3/ITD included the tyrosine-rich stretch between codons 589 and 599, and both MLL/ITD presented break points within Alu-repeats, as previously observed in de novo AML. The ITD were not related to any specific type of previous therapy, but three out of the five cases were observed among only six patients with overt t-AML and a normal karyotype (P = 0.0043).

In conclusion, FLT3/ITD and MLL/ITD are mainly observed in uncharacteristic cases of t-AML with a normal karyotype and unrelated to previous therapy for which reason they could represent sporadic cases of de novoAML.","['Christiansen, D H', 'Pedersen-Bjergaard, J']","['Christiansen DH', 'Pedersen-Bjergaard J']","['Section of Hematology and Oncology, Cytogenetic Laboratory, Department of Clinical Genetics, Juliane Marie Centre, Section 4052, Rigshospitalet, Blegdamsvej 9, 2100 Copenhagen O, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects', 'Base Sequence', 'Combined Modality Therapy/adverse effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Duplication/*drug effects', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/etiology/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/etiology/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*genetics', 'Tandem Repeat Sequences/genetics', '*Transcription Factors', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'WT1 Proteins/genetics', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3']",2001/12/26 10:00,2002/01/23 10:01,['2001/12/26 10:00'],"['2001/03/27 00:00 [received]', '2001/06/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2001/12/26 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/23 10:01 [medline]', '2001/12/26 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2001 Dec;15(12):1848-51. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402246.,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2402246 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) is more sensitive than CCA allowing for the detection of minor clones and of submicroscopic lesions.

In 18 patients, 15 to 32% of interphase cells were found to carry one FISH abnormality. Six patients presented trisomy 8, five had del(5)(q31), five del(7)(q31), one monosomy 7 and one del(17)(p13). FISH abnormalities were more frequently observed among patients with an increased percentage of bone marrow blasts (P = 0.001). FISH abnormalities were also associated with a higher rate of progression into AML (13/18 vs 12/83, P < 0.001) and were predictive for a worse prognosis (P < 0.001). Multivariate analysis indicated that FISH positivity and IPSS risk group were independent predictors for a poor survival (P = 0.0057 and 0.0123, respectively) and for leukemic transformation (P = 0.0006 and 0.035, respectively). Leukemic transformation in FISH-positive patients was associated in all cases with an expansion of the abnormal clone. Our data demonstrated that a significant proportion of MDS patients with normal karyotype presented, if analyzed by FISH, clones of cytogenetically abnormal cells which played a determinant role in the progression of the disease. The presence of FISH abnormalities identified a group of MDS patients with normal karyotype characterized by an inferior prognosis.","['Rigolin, G M', 'Bigoni, R', 'Milani, R', 'Cavazzini, F', 'Roberti, M G', 'Bardi, A', 'Agostini, P', 'Della Porta, M', 'Tieghi, A', 'Piva, N', 'Cuneo, A', 'Castoldi, G']","['Rigolin GM', 'Bigoni R', 'Milani R', 'Cavazzini F', 'Roberti MG', 'Bardi A', 'Agostini P', 'Della Porta M', 'Tieghi A', 'Piva N', 'Cuneo A', 'Castoldi G']","['Section of Hematology, Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Ferrara, Corso Giovecca, 203, 44100 Ferrara, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Clone Cells/pathology', 'Cytogenetic Analysis/methods/*standards', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence/standards', '*Interphase', 'Karyotyping', 'Male', 'Metaphase', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/diagnosis/*genetics/mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Rate']",2001/12/26 10:00,2002/01/23 10:01,['2001/12/26 10:00'],"['2001/02/26 00:00 [received]', '2001/07/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2001/12/26 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/23 10:01 [medline]', '2001/12/26 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2001 Dec;15(12):1841-7. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402293.,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2402293 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The molecular mechanisms responsible for this disease transition remain unknown. As increased expression of Bcr-Abl has been associated with blast crisis CML, we have established transfectants in 32D cells that express low and high levels of Bcr-Abl, and assessed their drug sensitivity. Cells with high Bcr-Abl expression levels are resistant to conventional cytotoxic drugs, and also require higher levels of STI571 (an inhibitor of Bcr-Abl), to induce cell death. Co-treatment with cytotoxic drugs and STI571 increased the sensitivity of the drug-resistant cells. Despite the drug-resistant phenotype, high Bcr-Abl levels concomitantly increased the expression of p53, p21, Bax and down-regulated Bcl-2. These cells maintain a survival advantage irrespective of a reduced proportion of cycling cells and the pro-apoptotic shift in gene expression. In addition, the level of Bcr-Abl expression (high or low) does not alter the growth factor independence and elevated Bcl-xL expression observed. Our study indicates that drug resistance can be primarily attained by increased Bcr-Abl expression, and highlights the potential of therapy which combines STI571 with conventional cytotoxic drugs.","['Keeshan, K', 'Mills, K I', 'Cotter, T G', 'McKenna, S L']","['Keeshan K', 'Mills KI', 'Cotter TG', 'McKenna SL']","['Department of Biochemistry, University College Cork, Ireland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/physiology', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*drug effects/enzymology', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'Transfection']",2001/12/26 10:00,2002/01/23 10:01,['2001/12/26 10:00'],"['2001/05/28 00:00 [received]', '2001/08/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2001/12/26 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/23 10:01 [medline]', '2001/12/26 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2001 Dec;15(12):1823-33. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402309.,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2402309 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Three hundred and seventy-eight ALL patients, referred to our hospital from 1978 to 1999, were reviewed for long-term follow-up data. The analysis included data on 351 patients treated by standard chemotherapy according to 11 different successive and/or concomitant regimens. Complete remission (CR) was achieved in 299 patients (79%). Initial performance status, LDH level, immunophenotype, age, and risk group (defined according to Hoelzer's criteria) at diagnosis were of significant prognostic value for CR achievement. Median leukemia-free survival (LFS) was 14 months with a 3-year, a 5-year, and an 8-year LFS at 30%, 26%, and 24%, respectively. LFS was better in T cell lineage ALL than in B cell lineage ALL (P = 0.05). Younger age was also a favorable prognostic factor for LFS (P = 0.001). Philadelphia-positive (Ph+) ALL displayed a poor outcome since median LFS was 7 months with only 13% of survival at 3 years. Median overall survival (OS) of the entire cohort was 18 months with a 3-year, a 5-year, and an 8-year OS at 32%, 24%, and 22% respectively. Favorable prognostic factors for OS were younger age (P < 0.0001), and T cell lineage ALL (P = 0.001). Among non-T cell lineage ALL, standard-risk ALL confirmed a significant better outcome than high-risk ALL (P = 0.0003). It was apparent from this analysis that hazard rates for death and relapse were greatest in the first year, decreased substantially between years 1 and 2, then decrease further between years 2 and 3. Rates of death and relapse were quite low after 3-4 years. All patients relapsing after 3 years of CR were B or non-B non-T cell lineage ALL. Long-term survivors (LTS), defined as survival in CR > or =3 years, represented 23% of evaluable patients. Eighty-three patients remain alive in initial CR at >3 years, while only three were LTS after a second CR. Overall, no significant improvement was shown in terms of CR achievement and survival duration over the years. However, regarding survival, a significant improvement was demonstrated in T cell lineage ALL (P = 0.03). Furthermore, patients (aged less than 50 years) transplanted while in first CR did significantly better than those receiving only chemotherapy as post-remission therapy (P < 0.0001). The 3-year OS, after allogeneic transplantation in first CR, was 74% in T cell lineage ALL, while it was less than 50% in B cell lineage ALL. This single center study on a large cohort of ALL patients reflects the degree to which ALL treatment remains unsuccessful in adults. Only T cell lineage ALL outcomes have improved over the years. The results suggest a time (3 years) at which it becomes reasonable to speak of potential cure, provided the patient is in CR.","['Thomas, X', 'Danaila, C', 'Le, Q H', 'Sebban, C', 'Troncy, J', 'Charrin, C', 'Lheritier, V', 'Michallet, M', 'Magaud, J P', 'Fiere, D']","['Thomas X', 'Danaila C', 'Le QH', 'Sebban C', 'Troncy J', 'Charrin C', 'Lheritier V', 'Michallet M', 'Magaud JP', 'Fiere D']","[""Service d'Hematologie Clinique, Hopital Edouard Herriot, Lyon, France.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Protocols', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*mortality/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Analysis']",2001/12/26 10:00,2002/01/23 10:01,['2001/12/26 10:00'],"['2001/04/24 00:00 [received]', '2001/07/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2001/12/26 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/23 10:01 [medline]', '2001/12/26 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2001 Dec;15(12):1811-22. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402289.,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2402289 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients with absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) <150 x 10(6)/l by day +30 had a 3.5-fold higher risk of relapse (P = 0.0088) and a lower overall survival (P = 0.0079) than patients with a higher ALC. We did not find correlation between lymphocyte count determined earlier in the post-transplantation course (day +21) and the risk of relapse. Patients receiving prednisone had a significantly lower ALC at day +30 than those who did not receive prednisone (289 vs 549 x 10(6)/l, P = 0.002). We conclude that a slow lymphocyte recovery after allogeneic BMT for AML is strongly predictive of subsequent relapse and that the type of GVHD prophylaxis should be considered when analyzing lymphocyte recovery.","['Kumar, S', 'Chen, M G', 'Gastineau, D A', 'Gertz, M A', 'Inwards, D J', 'Lacy, M Q', 'Tefferi, A', 'Litzow, M R']","['Kumar S', 'Chen MG', 'Gastineau DA', 'Gertz MA', 'Inwards DJ', 'Lacy MQ', 'Tefferi A', 'Litzow MR']","['Division of Hematology and Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,['VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)'],IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*mortality', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Contraindications', 'Female', 'Graft Survival/*drug effects', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*drug therapy/prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/mortality/*therapy', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Lymphocytes/cytology/*drug effects', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2001/12/26 10:00,2002/09/28 04:00,['2001/12/26 10:00'],"['2001/04/06 00:00 [received]', '2001/08/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2001/12/26 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/28 04:00 [medline]', '2001/12/26 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2001 Nov;28(10):951-6. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1703262.,,['10.1038/sj.bmt.1703262 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Direct evidence links the expression of MMPs to the metastatic phenotype of tumour cells and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP) to the inhibition of metastatisation. Gelatinase B (MMP-9, and no other MMP) has been shown in vitro to mediate CTB invasion. ECM components are known to influence adhesion, spreading, migration and differentiation of cells through specific cell surface receptors called integrins. While CTB migrate from the villous into the decidua they modulate their integrin repertoire, secrete MMP-9 and acquire the capacity to digest their environment. Although CTB behave like metastatic cells, in vivo they are only transiently invasive (first trimester) and their invasion is essentially limited to the endometrium and to the proximal myometrium. This temporal and spatial regulation seems to be mediated in a paracrine way by uterine factors and in an autocrine way by trophoblastic factors. We investigated the effects of endometrial regulators such as leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF), tumour necrosis factor (TNF), transforming growth factor beta (TGFb), interleukin-1 and 6 (IL-1, IL-6) and insulin-like growth factor binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1) as well as trophoblastic factors such as hCG and leptin. All these factors markedly influenced the secretion and/or activation of MMP-2 and MMP-9. Most cytokines influence cell behaviour by modulating phosphorylation of transcription factors. Among these we identified two oncogene products (Jun and Fos) which were activated by TNF or phorbol esters and which promoted the synthesis of MMP-9. We conclude that decidual and trophoblastic products are autocrine or paracrine regulators of trophoblastic invasion of the endometrium and that some of these products act by activating the transcription of early response genes such as transcription factors.","['Bischof, P']",['Bischof P'],"['Department Obstetrics & Gynaecology, University of Geneva, Switzerland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Early Pregnancy,Early pregnancy (Online),100940263,"['0 (Chorionic Gonadotropin)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Leptin)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 3.4.24.24 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 2)', 'EC 3.4.24.35 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 9)']",IM,,"['Chorionic Gonadotropin/pharmacology', 'Cytokines/*pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leptin/pharmacology', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 2/*physiology', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 9/*physiology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Trophoblasts/*drug effects/enzymology']",2001/12/26 10:00,2002/04/18 10:01,['2001/12/26 10:00'],"['2001/12/26 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/04/18 10:01 [medline]', '2001/12/26 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Early Pregnancy. 2001 Jan;5(1):30-1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we show that expression of BCR-ABL in myeloid precursor cells leads to transcriptional suppression of the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor G-CSF-R (encoded by CSF3R), possibly through down-modulation of C/EBPalpha-the principal regulator of granulocytic differentiation. Expression of C/EBPalpha protein is barely detectable in primary marrow cells taken from individuals affected with chronic myeloid leukemia in blast crisis. In contrast, CEBPA RNA is clearly present. Ectopic expression of C/EBPalpha induces granulocytic differentiation of myeloid precursor cells expressing BCR-ABL. Expression of C/EBPalpha is suppressed at the translational level by interaction of the poly(rC)-binding protein hnRNP E2 with CEBPA mRNA, and ectopic expression of hnRNP E2 in myeloid precursor cells down-regulates both C/EBPalpha and G-CSF-R and leads to rapid cell death on treatment with G-CSF (encoded by CSF3). Our results indicate that BCR-ABL regulates the expression of C/EBPalpha by inducing hnRNP E2-which inhibits the translation of CEBPA mRNA.","['Perrotti, Danilo', 'Cesi, Vincenzo', 'Trotta, Rossana', 'Guerzoni, Clara', 'Santilli, Giorgia', 'Campbell, Kenneth', 'Iervolino, Angela', 'Condorelli, Fabrizio', 'Gambacorti-Passerini, Carlo', 'Caligiuri, Michael A', 'Calabretta, Bruno']","['Perrotti D', 'Cesi V', 'Trotta R', 'Guerzoni C', 'Santilli G', 'Campbell K', 'Iervolino A', 'Condorelli F', 'Gambacorti-Passerini C', 'Caligiuri MA', 'Calabretta B']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Kimmel Cancer Center, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19107, USA.

However, a decreased production of type-2 cytokines by splenic T cells from MAIDS mice treated with Z-100 was demonstrated. CONCLUSION: Z-100 could decrease the severity of the LP-BM5 MuLV infection through the regulation of MAIDS-associated type-2 T-cell responses.","['Sasaki, H', 'Kobayashi, M', 'Pollard, R B', 'Suzuki, F']","['Sasaki H', 'Kobayashi M', 'Pollard RB', 'Suzuki F']","['Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, TX 77555-0435, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Pathobiology,"Pathobiology : journal of immunopathology, molecular and cellular biology",9007504,"['0 (Anti-HIV Agents)', '0 (Lipids)', '0 (Mannans)', '0 (specific substance maruyama)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Anti-HIV Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Antagonism', 'Interleukin-10/biosynthesis/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-4/biosynthesis/pharmacology', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/pathogenicity/*physiology', 'Lipids/*therapeutic use', 'Lymphatic Diseases/drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Mannans/*therapeutic use', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Murine Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Organ Size/drug effects', 'Specific Pathogen-Free Organisms', 'Spleen/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Splenomegaly/drug therapy/pathology', 'Survival Rate', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/metabolism/pathology']",2001/12/26 10:00,2002/03/01 10:01,['2001/12/26 10:00'],"['2001/12/26 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/01 10:01 [medline]', '2001/12/26 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Pathobiology. 2001;69(2):96-103. doi: 10.1159/000048762.,,"['pat69096 [pii]', '10.1159/000048762 [doi]']",,,,"['Copyright 2001 S.

TCL1 is located at 14q32.1 and activated by juxtaposition to the alpha/delta-locus at 14q11 or beta-locus at 7q35 of the T cell receptor during the reciprocal translocations t(14;14)(q11;q32), t(7;14)(q35;q32), or inversion inv(14)(q11;q32). TCL1 encodes a predominantly cytoplasmic protein of 114 aa (14 kD) of unknown function. Recent studies suggest that TCL1 promotes cell survival rather than stimulating cell proliferation, as previously proposed. METHODS: In an attempt to clarify the contexts in which TCL1 is expressed, we investigated TCL1 expression in 114 lymphoma and leukemia patients by Northern blot, RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: TCL1 expression is restricted to lymphoid cells, and is found in neoplastic (T and B cell neoplasms, and Hodgkin's disease) and nonneoplastic proliferations (reactive lesions). Out of 114 cases, 18 neoplasms of myeloid and 4 cases of epithelial origin were TCL1-negative. In lesions of the lymphoid system, both low- and high-grade lymphomas were found to express TCL1. CONCLUSIONS: We propose that TCL1 expression especially in high-grade B cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas might interfere with B cell differentiation and promote the transition from low- to high-grade lymphoma.","['Roos, J', 'Hennig, I', 'Schwaller, J', 'Zbaren, J', 'Dummer, R', 'Burg, G', 'Tobler, A', 'Virgilio, L', 'Croce, C M', 'Fey, M F', 'Borisch, B']","['Roos J', 'Hennig I', 'Schwaller J', 'Zbaren J', 'Dummer R', 'Burg G', 'Tobler A', 'Virgilio L', 'Croce CM', 'Fey MF', 'Borisch B']","['Institute of Pathology, University of Berne, Berne, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Pathobiology,"Pathobiology : journal of immunopathology, molecular and cellular biology",9007504,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (TCL1A protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,,"['Blotting, Northern', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*biosynthesis/blood', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia/blood/*metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphoma/blood/*metabolism/pathology', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'RNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transcription Factors/*biosynthesis/blood', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/12/26 10:00,2002/03/01 10:01,['2001/12/26 10:00'],"['2001/12/26 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/01 10:01 [medline]', '2001/12/26 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Pathobiology. 2001;69(2):59-66. doi: 10.1159/000048758.,,"['pat69059 [pii]', '10.1159/000048758 [doi]']",,,,"['Copyright 2001 S.

PCR analysis of immunoglobulin gene rearrangements demonstrated that four of the five biopsies (80%) gave rise to scid tumours which represented the original tumour cell clones. Immunophenotyping showed that these four biopsies (and all scid tumours) expressed all EBV latent genes and a B lymphoblast phenotype; <or=26% T cells were found in the biopsy material whereas scid tumours showed a paucity of T lymphocytes. RT-PCR analysis revealed expression of IL-2, -4, -6, -10 and IFN-gamma in all tumour material, suggesting key roles for these factors in tumour growth.

We have developed a method to immunoisolate activated T cell receptors (TCRs) and associated signaling molecules in plasma membrane subdomains from Jurkat T leukemic cells. The immunoisolation procedure for the signaling complexes uses magnetic beads, which are coupled to TCR-activating antibodies. Following mechanical cellular disruption using nitrogen cavitation, conjugates of these beads with Jurkat cells are formed and isolated. TCR-signaling complexes within plasma membrane fragments associate with the antibody-coupled beads and are retrieved along with the beads using a magnet. We found that the immunoisolated plasma membrane fragments are highly enriched for activated TCRs and associated signaling proteins.

Phase 2 enzymes (e.g., glutathione transferases, NAD(P)H:quinone reductase) and glutathione synthesis are widely recognized as playing major protective roles against electrophilic carcinogens, but their antioxidant functions have attracted far less attention. The cytotoxicities of four oxidative stressors (menadione, tert-butyl hydroperoxide, 4-hydroxynonenal, and peroxynitrite) for human adult retinal pigment epithelial cells (ARPE-19) were quantified by measuring the concentration dependence of cell death and were expressed as the median effect dose (D(m)) for each oxidant. After treatment of ARPE-19 cells for 24 h with 0-5 microM concentrations of sulforaphane (the powerful Phase 2 enzyme inducer isolated from broccoli), the toxicities of the oxidants were markedly reduced as shown by 1.5- to 3-fold increases in D(m) values. The magnitude of protection was a function of the nature of the oxidants and the concentrations of both the oxidants and sulforaphane. Protection was prolonged and persisted for several days after removal of sulforaphane before returning to control levels. The sulforaphane-dependent increases in specific activities of cytosolic quinone reductase and the glutathione levels were highly significantly correlated with the degree of protection as measured by D(m) values. Antioxidant protection was also demonstrated for human HaCaT keratinocytes and L1210 murine leukemia cells. It is therefore highly likely that the multifaceted and prolonged antioxidant protection provided by sulforaphane is a general phenomenon that is mediated through induction of the Phase 2 enzyme response.","['Gao, X', 'Dinkova-Kostova, A T', 'Talalay, P']","['Gao X', 'Dinkova-Kostova AT', 'Talalay P']","['Lewis B. and Dorothy Cullman Cancer Chemoprotection Center, and Department of Pharmacology and Molecular Sciences, The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21205, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Isothiocyanates)', '0 (Sulfoxides)', '0 (Thiocyanates)', 'EC 1.6.5.2 (NAD(P)H Dehydrogenase (Quinone))', 'GA49J4310U (sulforaphane)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Antioxidants/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Glutathione/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Isothiocyanates', 'Keratinocytes/cytology/*drug effects', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*pathology', 'Mice', 'NAD(P)H Dehydrogenase (Quinone)/metabolism', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Pigment Epithelium of Eye/cytology/*drug effects/enzymology', 'Sulfoxides', 'Thiocyanates/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/12/26 10:00,2002/01/23 10:01,['2001/12/26 10:00'],"['2001/12/26 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/23 10:01 [medline]', '2001/12/26 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2001 Dec 18;98(26):15221-6. doi: 10.1073/pnas.261572998.,,"['10.1073/pnas.261572998 [doi]', '98/26/15221 [pii]']",,,,,,,PMC65010,,,,,

Disparities between HLA sequence polymorphisms that are serologically detectable are termed antigen mismatches, whereas those that can be identified only by DNA-based typing methods are termed allele mismatches. Whether both kinds of polymorphisms are important in transplantation is not known. We tested the hypothesis that allele mismatches that are detectable only at the DNA level are less immunogenic than those that are serologically detectable and thereby are associated with a lower risk of graft failure after hematopoietic-cell transplantation METHODS: We used DNA sequencing to define the HLA-A, B, and C alleles in 471 patients who received bone marrow from unrelated donors for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia after myeloablative conditioning therapy. The odds ratios for graft failure were determined for recipients of transplants from donors with a single class I allele mismatch, a single class I antigen mismatch, or two or more class I mismatches, as compared with those with no mismatch RESULTS: A single HLA allele mismatch did not increase the risk of graft failure, whereas a single antigen mismatch significantly increased the risk. The risk was also increased if the recipient was HLA homozygous at the mismatched class I locus or if the donor had two or more class I mismatches CONCLUSIONS: HLA class I antigen mismatches that are serologically detectable confer an enhanced risk of graft failure after hematopoietic-cell transplantation. Transplants from donors with a single class I allele mismatch that is not serologically detectable may be used without an increased risk of graft failure.","['Petersdorf, E W', 'Hansen, J A', 'Martin, P J', 'Woolfrey, A', 'Malkki, M', 'Gooley, T', 'Storer, B', 'Mickelson, E', 'Smith, A', 'Anasetti, C']","['Petersdorf EW', 'Hansen JA', 'Martin PJ', 'Woolfrey A', 'Malkki M', 'Gooley T', 'Storer B', 'Mickelson E', 'Smith A', 'Anasetti C']","['Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA 98109, USA. epetersd@fhcrc.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,N Engl J Med,The New England journal of medicine,0255562,"['0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (HLA-A Antigens)', '0 (HLA-B Antigens)', '0 (HLA-C Antigens)']",IM,"['N Engl J Med. 2001 Dec 20;345(25):1842-4.

A significant reduction in work time was achieved by replacing the previously used Trypan blue dye exclusion (TBDE) test by an automated measurement of ATP levels as the concurrent viability test. The rapid and easy to perform ATP test was carried out towards the end of the 3 h treatment. In this way we were able to select for further analysis and slide preparation only those concentrations which induced the desired range of cytotoxicity. The suitability of the modified test conditions and reproducibility of test results was demonstrated by results obtained with standard mutagens and eight drug candidates tested at various concentrations. In each case the results obtained with the standard and the modified protocols were comparable. By introducing the changes to our standard protocol, combined with automated image analysis, we were able to more than double our previous throughput.","['Kiskinis, Evangelos', 'Suter, Willi', 'Hartmann, Andreas']","['Kiskinis E', 'Suter W', 'Hartmann A']","['Novartis Pharma AG, Genetic and Experimental Toxicology, WSH2881.5.14, CH-4002 Basel, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Mutagenesis,Mutagenesis,8707812,"['0 (Coloring Agents)', '0 (Mutagens)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'I2ZWO3LS3M (Trypan Blue)']",IM,,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/analysis', 'Animals', 'Cell Survival', 'Coloring Agents', 'Comet Assay/instrumentation/*methods', 'DNA Damage', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical/instrumentation/*methods', 'Leukemia L5178/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mutagens/pharmacology', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Time Factors', 'Trypan Blue', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/chemistry/drug effects', 'Work Simplification']",2001/12/26 10:00,2002/05/22 10:01,['2001/12/26 10:00'],"['2001/12/26 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/05/22 10:01 [medline]', '2001/12/26 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mutagenesis. 2002 Jan;17(1):37-43. doi: 10.1093/mutage/17.1.37.,,['10.1093/mutage/17.1.37 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

We show here that FA cells are resistant to treatments with rhodamine-1,2,3 and doxycycline, which both interfere with mitochondrial functionality by different mechanisms. In contrast, normal lymphoblastoid cells are severely affected by these treatments, which result in acute ATP depletion and a significant enhancement of the fraction of cells undergoing apoptotic cell death. FA cells are very sensitive to the action of 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2dG) and iodoacetic acid (IAA), two inhibitors of glycolytic metabolism. The ability of FA cells to sustain metabolic insults interfering with energy production and balance may be linked with the pathological manifestations of the disease, including susceptibility to acute myeloid leukemia. These findings suggest that FA genes may be involved in a pathway that mediates a protective response to stress. We suggest that a peculiar metabolic regulation in FA cells could explain both defective apoptosis and susceptibility to oxidative stress.","['Bogliolo, Massimo', 'Borghini, Silvia', 'Abbondandolo, Angelo', 'Degan, Paolo']","['Bogliolo M', 'Borghini S', 'Abbondandolo A', 'Degan P']","['Laboratory of Mutagenesis, National Cancer Research Institute, IST, Lgo R.

We investigated the action of FMdC on DNA metabolism by evaluating its incorporation into DNA, its excision from DNA in vitro, and the role of the incorporation of FMdC into DNA in causing cytotoxicity. In vitro DNA primer extension demonstrated that FMdC nucleotides were incorporated with relatively high substrate efficiency into the C sites of the elongating DNA strand. Once incorporated, FMdC became a poor substrate for further chain elongation by DNA polymerases, resulting in a termination of DNA synthesis at the sites of incorporation. Furthermore, the 3' --> 5' exonuclease activity of DNA polymerase epsilon or wild-type p53 protein was ineffective in removing the incorporated FMdC from DNA in vitro. FMdC also showed potent cytotoxic activity against human leukemia and solid tumor cells. Incubation with a low concentration of FMdC (10 nM) induced cell cycle arrest at S or G1 phases, but the cells eventually died as the time of incubation increased. Compared with HL-60 cells, human myeloid ML-1 cells with wild-type p53 were more sensitive to FMdC, but the S or G1 phase arrest did not seem to depend on the presence or absence of p53. Inhibiting the incorporation of FMdC into cellular DNA by aphidicolin suppressed the cytotoxic effect of the compound. We conclude that the incorporated FMdC nucleotide profoundly disrupts DNA synthesis and resists excision by exonucleases, and that incorporation of this analog into DNA is a key molecular event responsible for the drug's cytotoxicity.","['Zhou, Yan', 'Achanta, Geetha', 'Pelicano, Helene', 'Gandhi, Varsha', 'Plunkett, William', 'Huang, Peng']","['Zhou Y', 'Achanta G', 'Pelicano H', 'Gandhi V', 'Plunkett W', 'Huang P']","['Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas M.

It does not infect any of the established tissue culture cell lines, including human hepatoma cell lines (HepG2 and Huh-7), or rat primary hepatocytes. The infectivity of MLV(HBV) for human hepatocytes was inhibited by anti-HBs antibody. The L form of HBsAg was both necessary and sufficient for virus infectivity, but the presence of both L and S forms enhanced the surface expression of HBsAg and thus increased virus production.

However, colocalization experiments using a panel of markers demonstrated that Gag proteins were not associated with the membranes involved in the secretory or endocytosis pathway. Small amounts of Gag proteins were detected at the plasma membrane and colocalized with the envelope glycoproteins. Moreover, Gag proteins were excluded from streptolysin-O permeabilized cells and in this respect behaved like cytoplasmic proteins.

In megakaryocyte-like human erythroleukemia (HEL) cells, ERK2 was found to be predominantly expressed and strongly activated by prostaglandin (PG) E(2), thrombin, and epinephrine. On the other hand, adenosine, ADP, ATP, and UTP did not significantly increase ERK1/2 phosphorylation. However, of the agonists tested, only ADP was able to stimulate thymidine uptake. Pretreatment with pertussis toxin abolished the PGE(2) response but had less of an effect on thrombin. PGE(2)- and thrombin-induced ERK1/2 activation was mimicked by 4-beta-phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate and ionomycin and blocked by mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase inhibitor 1,4 diamino-2,3-dicyano-1,4-bis[2-aminophenylthio]butadiene but displayed differential sensitivity to protein kinase C inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide I and Ca(2+) chelator 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid. Analogs of cAMP or agents that stimulate cAMP production were either weak or ineffective activators. Further studies indicate that the effect of thrombin was blocked by the phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin but not by agents inhibiting tyrosine kinase activity. On the contrary, herbimycin, but not wortmannin, attenuated the effect of PGE(2). Collectively, these results indicate that ERK1/2 are selectively activated by G protein-coupled receptors and not functionally associated with proliferation in HEL cells. ERK1/2 activation in response to PGE(2) and thrombin is mediated by distinctive types of G proteins and is differentially regulated by multiple pathways, including calcium mobilization, protein kinase C, phosphoinositide 3-kinase, and tyrosine kinases.","['Wu, Hung', 'Shen, Huang-Wei', 'Wu, Tin-Feng', 'Brass, Lawrence F', 'Sung, Kuo-Chun']","['Wu H', 'Shen HW', 'Wu TF', 'Brass LF', 'Sung KC']","['Department of Pharmacy, Chia Nan University of Pharmacy and Science, Tainan, Taiwan. hungwu@mail.chna.edu.tw']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Pharmacol Exp Ther,The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics,0376362,"['0 (Enzyme Activators)', '0 (Virulence Factors, Bordetella)', 'EC 2.4.2.31 (Pertussis Toxin)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",IM,,"['Calcium/metabolism', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Enzyme Activators/pharmacology', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Megakaryocytes/*metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Mitosis/*drug effects', 'Pertussis Toxin', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Kinase C/metabolism', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', 'Thymidine/metabolism', 'Virulence Factors, Bordetella/pharmacology']",2001/12/26 10:00,2002/01/25 10:01,['2001/12/26 10:00'],"['2001/12/26 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/25 10:01 [medline]', '2001/12/26 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Pharmacol Exp Ther. 2002 Jan;300(1):339-45. doi: 10.1124/jpet.300.1.339.,,['10.1124/jpet.300.1.339 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Although many chemokine receptors have been demonstrated to internalize through clathrin-coated vesicles, a process that involves the binding of arrestins to the receptors, accumulating evidence has suggested the possible existence of other regulators. In a yeast two-hybrid screening using the C-terminal domain of CXCR2 as a bait, the Hsc70-interacting protein (Hip) was identified to interact with CXCR2. Hip binds CXCR2 through its C-terminal domain binding to the C-terminal leucine-rich domain (KILAIHGLI) of CXCR2. Hip associates with CXCR2 or CXCR4 in intact cells, and agonist stimulation increases the association. Mutation of the Ile-Leu motif in the C-terminal domain of CXCR2 blocks the agonist-dependent association of the mutant receptor with Hip. Overexpression of a tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) deletion mutant form of Hip (Delta TPR), which is unable to bind Hsc70 (Prapapanich, V., Chen, S., Nair, S. C., Rimerman, R. A., and Smith, D. F.

However, overexpression of Delta TPR significantly attenuates the agonist-induced internalization of CXCR2 and CXCR4 and attenuates CXCR2-mediated chemotaxis. These findings open the possibility for regulation of chemokine receptor signaling and trafficking by protein chaperone molecules.","['Fan, Guo-Huang', 'Yang, Wei', 'Sai, Jiqing', 'Richmond, Ann']","['Fan GH', 'Yang W', 'Sai J', 'Richmond A']","['Department of Veterans Affairs, Nashville, Tennessee 37212-2637, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-8B)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (ST13 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Carrier Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Gene Library', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute', 'Ligands', 'Peptide Fragments/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Receptors, CXCR4/physiology', 'Receptors, Interleukin-8B/chemistry/genetics/*physiology', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', '*Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",2001/12/26 10:00,2002/04/25 10:01,['2001/12/26 10:00'],"['2001/12/26 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/04/25 10:01 [medline]', '2001/12/26 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2002 Feb 22;277(8):6590-7. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M110588200.

METHODS: Leukemic blasts were isolated from peripheral blood and bone marrow by a standard Ficoll-hypaque procedure. Proteins were removed by ultrafiltration in the presence of dithiothreitol. Thiopurine ribonucleotides were converted into their respective ribonucleosides by treatment of ultrafiltrate with acid phosphatase. Thiopurine nucleosides and bases were measured by direct injection of ultrafiltrate into the chromatographic system. Thiopurine nucleotide concentrations were calculated by subtracting the thiopurine nucleoside concentrations measured after treatment with acid phosphatase from those measured after direct injection of ultrafiltrate in the chromatographic system. Analytes were separated on a C18 Supelco column with ammonium phosphate-methanol eluent coupled with ultraviolet detection. RESULTS: CVs for intra- and interday precision were 1.1-14% (median, 4.9%), and recovery of added analyte was 89-126% (median, 105%) at low and high concentrations of analytes, except for mercaptopurine riboside. The median signal for each of the five metabolites in lymphoblast samples was 98% (range, 80-106%) of that in water. Detection limits for thiopurine bases and nucleosides ranged from 0.5 to 4.5 pmol/5 x 10(6) cells. CONCLUSIONS: This method is suitable for measurement of thiopurine metabolite concentrations in lymphoblasts in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia following a single dose of intravenous mercaptopurine.","['Dervieux, Thierry', 'Chu, Yaqin', 'Su, Yi', 'Pui, Ching-Hon', 'Evans, William E', 'Relling, Mary V']","['Dervieux T', 'Chu Y', 'Su Y', 'Pui CH', 'Evans WE', 'Relling MV']","[""Department of.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Forty-two patients with resected breast carcinoma involving one or more ipsilateral axillary lymph nodes, were randomized to receive two different schedules of adjuvant chemotherapy using 14-day dosing intervals: either (a) three cycles of doxorubicin 80 mg/m(2) as i.v. bolus followed sequentially by three cycles of paclitaxel 200 mg/m(2) as a 24-h infusion and then by three cycles of cyclophosphamide 3.0 g/m(2) as a 1-h infusion (arm A); or (b) the same schedule of doxorubicin followed by three cycles of concurrent cyclophosphamide and paclitaxel at the same doses (arm B). All cycles were supported by granulocyte colony-stimulating factor administration. RESULTS: Forty-one patients were assessable for toxicity and feasibility; 37 (90%) completed all planned chemotherapy. There was no treatment-related mortality; however, increased toxicity was observed on arm B compared with arm A, manifested by an increase in hospitalization for toxicity, mainly neutropenic fever, and an increased incidence of transfusion of packed RBCs transfusions for anemia. The mean delivered dose intensities for paclitaxel and cyclophosphamide were significantly greater for arm A compared with arm B (P =.01 and P =.05, respectively). There is no long-term, treatment-related toxicity, and no cases of acute myelogenous leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome have been observed. CONCLUSIONS: Dose-dense sequential single-agent chemotherapy is more feasible than doxorubicin with subsequent concurrent paclitaxel and cyclophosphamide.","['Fornier, M N', 'Seidman, A D', 'Theodoulou, M', 'Moynahan, M E', 'Currie, V', 'Moasser, M', 'Sklarin, N', 'Gilewski, T', ""D'Andrea, G"", 'Salvaggio, R', 'Panageas, K S', 'Norton, L', 'Hudis, C']","['Fornier MN', 'Seidman AD', 'Theodoulou M', 'Moynahan ME', 'Currie V', 'Moasser M', 'Sklarin N', 'Gilewski T', ""D'Andrea G"", 'Salvaggio R', 'Panageas KS', 'Norton L', 'Hudis C']","['Breast Cancer Medicine Service, Division of Solid Tumor Oncology, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology/radiotherapy/surgery', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hospitalization', 'Humans', 'Lymphatic Metastasis', 'Mammography', 'Mastectomy, Modified Radical', 'Middle Aged', 'Paclitaxel/administration & dosage/*adverse effects']",2001/12/26 10:00,2002/03/28 10:01,['2001/12/26 10:00'],"['2001/12/26 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '2001/12/26 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2001 Dec;7(12):3934-41.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, inhibition of stem cell factor (SCF)-induced c-kit phosphorylation and cell proliferation by STI571 was reported in the human myeloid cell line MO7e. Because approximately 70% of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) cases are c-kit positive, we evaluated in vitro effects of STI571 on c-kit-positive cell lines and primary AML blast cells. At concentrations >5 microM, the drug marginally inhibited SCF-independent proliferation of cell lines and most of AML blasts. Treatment of AML cells with cytarabine and STI571 showed synergistic effect at low concentrations. Western blotting analysis documented a distinct band of M(r) 145,000 specific for c-kit in cell lines and in AML samples. There was no correlation between the level of the c-kit expression evaluated by Western blotting and percentage of c-kit-positive blasts as measured by flow cytometry. Neither in cell lines nor in primary AML cells, c-kit autophosphorylation was detectable under standard growth conditions. SCF-induced phosphorylation of c-kit in MO7e cells was inhibited by STI571. In a c-kit-positive AML-4 cell line, as well as in AML samples, c-kit phosphorylation was not induced by SCF exposure, suggesting that in these cases, the receptor could not be functionally activated. In conclusion, with the exception of MO7e, SCF did not induce phosphorylation of c-kit, and cell proliferation was not modulated in the presence of STI571. We did not detect any SCF-independent c-kit phosphorylation in our experimental systems. Consequently, STI571 exerted only a limited inhibitory effect on the cell growth.","['Scappini, B', 'Onida, F', 'Kantarjian, H M', 'Dong, L', 'Verstovsek, S', 'Keating, M J', 'Beran, M']","['Scappini B', 'Onida F', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Dong L', 'Verstovsek S', 'Keating MJ', 'Beran M']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.

The extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), originally identified as a participant in mitogenic signaling, has recently been implicated in the signaling of cellular differentiation. To examine the role of the ERK/mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway in B-lymphoid cell differentiation of the Reh Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia cell line, the effects of bryo 1 on ERK activation were determined. On bryo 1 treatment, the activity of ERK2 (p42) rapidly increased, with ERK1 (p44) protein levels remaining constant. p44/42 immunoprecipitates from lysates of bryo 1-treated cells had increased their ability to phosphorylate the transcription factor Elk-1. Constitutive AP-1 activity was shown to be potentiated after bryo 1 treatment using electrophoretic mobility shift assays. The protein composition of the AP-1 transcription factor complex activated by bryo 1 was analyzed using supershift analysis with specific antibodies against c-Fos, Fos B, c-Jun, Jun B, and Jun D proteins. Supershift analysis revealed that the bryo 1-induced AP-1 complex was composed predominantly of Fos B and Jun D. Therefore, we evaluated the effects of inhibiting MAP/ERK kinase (MEK) on both DNA binding and cellular differentiation. Treatment of Reh cells with 20 microM PD98059, a specific inhibitor of MEK, inhibited bryo 1-induced ERK activity and DNA binding. Furthermore, PD98059 blocked the bryo 1-induced differentiation of Reh cells, as assessed by a number of features associated with lymphoid differentiation, including changes in morphology, cell growth arrest, attachment, and increased expression of the leukocyte integrin CD11c. Moreover, transient transfection of Reh cells with antisense MAP kinase oligonucleotides blocked bryo 1-induced expression of CD11c. Our analysis also shows that CD11c's gene promoter activity is augmented by bryo 1. Therefore, we conclude that activation of the MEK/ERK signaling pathway is necessary for bryo 1-induced differentiation of the pre-B Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia cell line Reh.","['Wall, N R', 'Mohammad, R M', 'Al-Katib, A M']","['Wall NR', 'Mohammad RM', 'Al-Katib AM']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Karmanos Cancer Institute at Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, MI 48201, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cell Growth Differ,Cell growth & differentiation : the molecular biology journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9100024,"['0 (Bacterial Proteins)', '0 (Bryostatins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (FOSB protein, human)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Integrin alphaXbeta2)', '0 (Lactones)', '0 (Macrolides)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun)', '37O2X55Y9E (bryostatin 1)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'SJE1IO5E3I (2-(2-amino-3-methoxyphenyl)-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)']",IM,,"['Bacterial Proteins/metabolism', 'Binding Sites', 'Blotting, Western', 'Bryostatins', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Flavonoids/pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Integrin alphaXbeta2/biosynthesis', 'Lactones/*metabolism', 'Luciferases/metabolism', '*MAP Kinase Signaling System', 'Macrolides', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/pharmacology', 'Plasmids/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*metabolism', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/12/26 10:00,2002/03/05 10:01,['2001/12/26 10:00'],"['2001/12/26 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/12/26 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cell Growth Differ. 2001 Dec;12(12):641-7.,,,,,,,,['P30 CA22453-20/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,

In these cells, which displayed unchanged levels of the ubiquitous basic helix-loop-helix E2A factors and Id proteins, Tax was found to target the muscle-specific basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor MyoD. The Tax-induced increase in cyclin-dependent kinase 2 activity correlated with the phosphorylation of MyoD. However, the half-life of this hyperphosphorylated form of MyoD increased in Tax-expressing myoblasts, contrary to that in control cells. Furthermore, MyoD mRNA levels were reduced in Tax-expressing cells. Tax was found to repress MyoD expression at the transcriptional step by preventing MyoD from activating its own transcription. Interestingly, overexpression of the transcriptional coactivator p300 restored the capacity of Tax-expressing muscle cells to differentiate. These observations underscore the critical effect of the trans-repressing ability of Tax on the MyoD-controlled proliferation and differentiation processes of the myoblast lineage.","['Riou, P', 'Vandromme, M', 'Gazzolo, L']","['Riou P', 'Vandromme M', 'Gazzolo L']","['Unite Mixte de Recherche 5537 Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique-Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1, Faculte de Medecine RTH Laennec, Rue Guillaume Paradin, 69372 Lyon Cedex 08, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cell Growth Differ,Cell growth & differentiation : the molecular biology journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9100024,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (MyoD Protein)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Protein Synthesis Inhibitors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (E1A-Associated p300 Protein)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (Ep300 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDC2-CDC28 Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cdk2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)', 'EC 3.2.1.23 (beta-Galactosidase)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Western', '*CDC2-CDC28 Kinases', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/metabolism', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'DNA, Complementary/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation', 'E1A-Associated p300 Protein', 'Gene Products, tax/*metabolism', 'Helix-Loop-Helix Motifs', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Muscles/*cytology', 'MyoD Protein/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Phosphorylation', 'Plasmids/metabolism', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Protein Synthesis Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Trans-Activators/biosynthesis', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection', 'beta-Galactosidase/metabolism']",2001/12/26 10:00,2002/03/05 10:01,['2001/12/26 10:00'],"['2001/12/26 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/12/26 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cell Growth Differ. 2001 Dec;12(12):613-22.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and certain inflammatory cytokines are always elevated during the human carcinogenic process. However, the biological significance of the interplay between ROS and inflammatory cytokine remains elusive. This study demonstrates that interleukin-6 (IL-6) effectively protects gastric cancer cells from the apoptosis induced by hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)). The cell death signaling JNK pathway elicited by H(2)O(2) is also inhibited by IL-6. We further found that Mcl-1, but not other Bcl-2 family members, was up-regulated by IL-6, by a substantial level over 24 h. We further transfected a mcl-1 expression vector, pCMV-mcl-1, into the AGS cells, and successfully obtained several mcl-1-overexpressing clones. Flow cytometric analysis shows that these mcl-1-overexpressing AGS cells are more resistant to the apoptosis induced by H(2)O(2) when compared with the neo control AGS cells. Consistently, the activation of the JNK pathway induced by H(2)O(2) is also blocked in mcl-1-overexpressed cells. These results indicate that the anti-apoptotic effect of IL-6 is, at least in part, due to the up-regulation of mcl-1. To our surprise, either IL-6 exposure or mcl-1 overexpression fails to reduce the level of intracellular peroxides in the AGS cells triggered by H(2)O(2). This study also determined the level of 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OH-dGua), an indicator for oxidative DNA lesions in IL-6-treated or mcl-1-overexpressed AGS cells after treatment with H(2)O(2). Notably, our results indicate that a majority of the 8-OH-dGua is efficiently removed in the AGS cells without IL-6 treatment, whereas only approximately 50% of the 8-OH-dGua was repaired in the IL-6-treated AGS cells after 24 h. Similarly, approximately 60-70% of the 8-OH-dGua also failed to repair and was retained in the genomic DNA of the mcl-1 transfectants. Results in this study provide a novel mechanism by which up-regulation of the Mcl-1 protein by IL-6 may enhance the susceptibility to H(2)O(2)-induced oxidative DNA lesions by overriding apoptosis.","['Lin, M T', 'Juan, C Y', 'Chang, K J', 'Chen, W J', 'Kuo, M L']","['Lin MT', 'Juan CY', 'Chang KJ', 'Chen WJ', 'Kuo ML']","['Department of Surgery, National Taiwan Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Carcinogenesis,Carcinogenesis,8008055,"['0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', ""88847-89-6 (8-Hydroxy-2'-Deoxyguanosine)"", 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 4)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases)', 'G9481N71RO (Deoxyguanosine)']",IM,,"[""8-Hydroxy-2'-Deoxyguanosine"", 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'DNA Damage/*drug effects/genetics', 'Deoxyguanosine/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/pharmacology', 'Immunoblotting', 'Interleukin-6/*pharmacology', '*JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 4', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Oxidative Stress/*drug effects', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Stomach Neoplasms/*genetics/*pathology', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",2001/12/26 10:00,2002/02/05 10:01,['2001/12/26 10:00'],"['2001/12/26 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/12/26 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Carcinogenesis. 2001 Dec;22(12):1947-53. doi: 10.1093/carcin/22.12.1947.,,['10.1093/carcin/22.12.1947 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the molecules that recognize the incorporated analogues in DNA and subsequently initiate the downstream cellular responses remain to be identified. Here, we report that the DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) and p53 are able to form a protein complex that interacts with the gemcitabine-containing DNA and plays a role in signaling to apoptotic pathways. DNA-PK/Ku and p53 were copurified in a protein fraction that binds to gemcitabine-containing DNA in preference to normal DNA. Immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that the two proteins physically associate in a complex. Treatment with gemcitabine resulted in an increase of DNA-PK and p53 protein and an increase in the phosphorylation of p53 at Ser15. Furthermore, confocal microscopy demonstrated a colocalization of DNA-PK and p53 to the nucleus in cells treated with gemcitabine. The nuclear localization of the DNA-PK/p53 complex was coincident with the induction of apoptosis in these cells. Although the wild-type p53 present in the protein complex exhibited 3'-5' exonuclease activity, it was incapable of excising the incorporated gemcitabine from DNA. The binding of the p53/DNA-PK complex to DNA substantially blocked further DNA synthesis by DNA polymerases alpha and epsilon in vitro, indicating a stalling of this complex at the site of drug incorporation.

GISTs are characterized by mutations in the proto-oncogene KIT that lead to constitutive activation of its tyrosine kinase activity. The tyrosine kinase inhibitor STI571, active against the BCR-ABL fusion protein in chronic myeloid leukemia, was recently shown to be highly effective in GISTs. We used 13,826-element cDNA microarrays to define the expression patterns of 13 KIT mutation-positive GISTs and compared them with the expression profiles of a group of spindle cell tumors from locations outside the gastrointestinal tract. Our results showed a remarkably distinct and uniform expression profile for all of the GISTs. In particular, hierarchical clustering of a subset of 113 cDNAs placed all of the GIST samples into one branch, with a Pearson correlation >0.91. This homogeneity suggests that the molecular pathogenesis of a GIST results from expansion of a clone that has acquired an activating mutation in KIT without the extreme genetic instability found in the common epithelial cancers. The results provide insight into the histogenesis of GIST and the clinical behavior of this therapeutically responsive tumor.","['Allander, S V', 'Nupponen, N N', 'Ringner, M', 'Hostetter, G', 'Maher, G W', 'Goldberger, N', 'Chen, Y', 'Carpten, J', 'Elkahloun, A G', 'Meltzer, P S']","['Allander SV', 'Nupponen NN', 'Ringner M', 'Hostetter G', 'Maher GW', 'Goldberger N', 'Chen Y', 'Carpten J', 'Elkahloun AG', 'Meltzer PS']","['Cancer Genetics Branch, National Human Genome Research Institute, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Female', 'Gastrointestinal Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Mutation', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Sarcoma/*genetics/metabolism', 'Stromal Cells/pathology']",2001/12/26 10:00,2002/01/11 10:01,['2001/12/26 10:00'],"['2001/12/26 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/11 10:01 [medline]', '2001/12/26 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2001 Dec 15;61(24):8624-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We tested the algorithm on colon and leukemia data sets. As an extension to our earlier work, we systematically examine the sensitivity, reproducibility and stability of gene selection/sample classification to the choice of parameters of the algorithm. METHODS: Our approach combines a Genetic Algorithm (GA) and the k-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) method to identify genes that can jointly discriminate between different classes of samples (e.g. normal versus tumor). The GA/KNN method is a stochastic supervised pattern recognition method. The genes identified are subsequently used to classify independent test set samples. RESULTS: The GA/KNN method is capable of selecting a subset of predictive genes from a large noisy data set for sample classification. It is a multivariate approach that can capture the correlated structure in the data. We find that for a given data set gene selection is highly repeatable in independent runs using the GA/KNN method. In general, however, gene selection may be less robust than classification.

In a previous study, only HIV-1 envelope protein lacking cytoplasmic 144 amino acids has been reported to be able to incorporate into MuLV particles. We designed and constructed a vector, pcKCX, expressing the envelope glycoprotein with cytoplasmic truncation by introducing the partial foreign HIV-1 env gene corresponding to the ectodomain of its envelope protein. Three HIV-1 env genes of AD8, BaL or 89.6 strains were cloned, and the HIV-1/MuLV pseudotypes were generated in the transfected TELCeB6 cells with all the cloned plasmids. The pseudotypes displayed host specificity depending on their original HIV-1 strains and their infection to the target cells was inhibited by treatment of a potent anti-HIV-1 peptide C34. A stable cell clone against the HIV-1(BaL) strain was found to express the R5 tropic envelope glycoprotein on the cell surface and to produce continuously HIV-1(BaL)/MuLV pseudotypes. These results suggested that the vector system is useful for cloning of various foreign HIV-1 env genes and the recombinant envelope glycoproteins effectively incorporate into MuLV particles.

Patients with angiocentric lymphoma presented with favourable prognostic factors, whereas those with AILD presented with unfavourable prognostic factors. Most patients were treated with doxorubicin-containing combination chemotherapy (with or without radiation therapy). The overall complete remission rate was 61.2% (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 48.5-72.8%) and the 5-year probability of failure-free survival was 33.5%. Median survival of all patients was 45 months (range 0-64+ months) and the 5-year probability of survival was 36.2%. In the multivariate analysis, only the International Prognosis Index (IPI) was an independent prognostic factor for overall survival (P<0.01). Taken together, the proportion of angiocentric lymphoma in this study was higher than that in the studies of Western countries. PTCL responds poorly to treatment with low survival rates and the IPI is a useful prognostic factor for PTCL.","['Kim, K', 'Kim, W S', 'Jung, C W', 'Im, Y-H', 'Kang, W K', 'Lee, M H', 'Park, C H', 'Ko, Y-H', 'Ree, H-J', 'Park, K']","['Kim K', 'Kim WS', 'Jung CW', 'Im YH', 'Kang WK', 'Lee MH', 'Park CH', 'Ko YH', 'Ree HJ', 'Park K']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, 50 Ilwon-Dong, Kangnam-Ku, Seoul 135-710, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Eur J Cancer,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",9005373,"['5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'CHOP protocol']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/methods', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell, Peripheral/*pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Radiotherapy, Adjuvant/methods', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",2001/12/26 10:00,2002/03/08 10:01,['2001/12/26 10:00'],"['2001/12/26 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/08 10:01 [medline]', '2001/12/26 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Cancer. 2002 Jan;38(1):75-81. doi: 10.1016/s0959-8049(01)00344-6.,,"['S0959804901003446 [pii]', '10.1016/s0959-8049(01)00344-6 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We assessed the pathophysiological significance of selenium (Se) by comparing the concentrations of serum Se and C-reactive protein (CRP) in healthy subjects (141; M=71, F=70) vs. patients with various pathological conditions. RESULTS: In normal males in their 40s, peak serum Se concentrations were observed (2.03+/-0.30 microg/g of serum protein, 128%, P<0.001) vs. males in their 20s (1.59+/-0.20), whereas a peak was observed in females in their 30s (1.87+/-0.31, 119%, P<0.025) vs. those in their 20s (1.57+/-0.22). The serum Se concentrations in the high CRP value group (n=40, 1.07+/-0.29 microg/g, 64.1%), the rheumatoid arthritis (RA) test positive group (n=24, 1.37+/-0.29, 82.0%), the lung cancer group (n=16, 1.38+/-0.30, 82.6%), and the adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) group (n=22, 1.26+/-0.35, 75.4%) were significantly lower (P<0.001) than those in the healthy subjects (1.67+/-0.29 microg/g). This finding was confirmed by inducing acute phase response (APR) in rats by injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which produced a significant decrease of Se in plasma and liver (69.5% and 81.6% vs. untreated rats, P<0.05). In contrast, the Se content in muscle, kidney, lung, spleen, heart, and thymus showed increases of <10%. Se mobilized from liver after LPS-challenge appeared to be translocated to muscle, and Se concentrations recovered by 80 h after APR to the control concentrations in parallel with the subsidence of APR. CONCLUSIONS: The reduction of Se in the liver and plasma during APR may be associated with the increased CRP synthesis in the liver.","['Maehira, Fusako', 'Luyo, Gloria A', 'Miyagi, Ikuko', 'Oshiro, Masaru', 'Yamane, Nobuhisa', 'Kuba, Mutsuo', 'Nakazato, Yukiyasu']","['Maehira F', 'Luyo GA', 'Miyagi I', 'Oshiro M', 'Yamane N', 'Kuba M', 'Nakazato Y']","['Laboratory of Clinical Biochemistry, Department of Health Technology, School of Health Sciences, University of the Ryukyus, 207 Uehara, Nishihara, Okinawa 903-0125, Japan. fmaehira@med.u-ryukyu.ac.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Clin Chim Acta,Clinica chimica acta; international journal of clinical chemistry,1302422,"['0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Trace Elements)', '9007-41-4 (C-Reactive Protein)', 'H6241UJ22B (Selenium)']",IM,,"['Acute-Phase Reaction/*blood', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Animals', 'Arthritis, Rheumatoid/blood', 'C-Reactive Protein/analysis', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/blood', 'Lipopolysaccharides/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Liver/metabolism', 'Lung Neoplasms/blood', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Selenium/*blood/deficiency/metabolism', 'Tissue Distribution', 'Trace Elements/blood/deficiency']",2001/12/26 10:00,2002/11/26 04:00,['2001/12/26 10:00'],"['2001/12/26 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/11/26 04:00 [medline]', '2001/12/26 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Clin Chim Acta. 2002 Feb;316(1-2):137-46. doi: 10.1016/s0009-8981(01)00744-6.,,"['S0009898101007446 [pii]', '10.1016/s0009-8981(01)00744-6 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated whether this effect was due to SDF-1-mediated induction of adhesion through beta1 integrins. METHODS: Adhesion of pre-B ALL cells or the cell line NALM6 to extracellular matrix proteins was examined using short-term in vitro binding assays. The effects of exposure of cells to SDF-1, antibodies to CXCR4, and the G protein inhibitor pertussis toxin (PTX) were assessed. The consequences of down regulation of CXCR4 on the in vivo behavior of pre-B ALL cells after injection into sublethally irradiated NOD/SCID mice was studied. RESULTS: Treatment with SDF-1 of NALM6 cells or cells from cases of precursor-B ALL resulted in a doubling of adhesion to fibronectin, laminin, and VCAM-1, but had no effect on binding to collagens I or IV. Antibodies to CXCR4 and PTX inhibited SDF-1-induced adhesion on these substrates. NALM6 cells with CXCR4 expression downregulated by SDF-1 exposure demonstrated a reduced capacity to engraft into the bone marrow of NOD/SCID mice, with only 22 +/- 11% of marrow cells being of human origin in mice receiving SDF-1-treated cells compared to 48 +/- 5% in mice receiving untreated cells (p < 0.001). The homing of SDF-1-treated cells to the bone marrow after 24 hours was also reduced by 72 +/- 16% compared to control cells. CONCLUSIONS: These data show that SDF-1 and CXCR4 are involved in regulation of beta1 integrin function, and are important for the localization of pre-B cells to the bone marrow in vivo.","['Shen, W', 'Bendall, L J', 'Gottlieb, D J', 'Bradstock, K F']","['Shen W', 'Bendall LJ', 'Gottlieb DJ', 'Bradstock KF']","['Westmead Institute for Cancer Research, Westmead Millennium Institute, Westmead, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (CXCL12 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL12)', '0 (Chemokines, CXC)', '0 (Cxcl12 protein, mouse)', '0 (Extracellular Matrix Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)', '0 (Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1)', '0 (Virulence Factors, Bordetella)', 'EC 2.4.2.31 (Pertussis Toxin)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antibodies/pharmacology', 'B-Lymphocytes/*pathology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*pathology', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/pathology', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects/*physiology', 'Cell Movement/drug effects/*physiology', 'Chemokine CXCL12', 'Chemokines, CXC/*pharmacology/physiology', 'Down-Regulation/*drug effects', 'Extracellular Matrix Proteins/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Pertussis Toxin', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/pathology', 'Protein Binding', 'Receptors, CXCR4/drug effects/*physiology', 'Transplantation, Heterologous/immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1/pharmacology', 'Virulence Factors, Bordetella/pharmacology']",2001/12/26 10:00,2002/01/25 10:01,['2001/12/26 10:00'],"['2001/12/26 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/25 10:01 [medline]', '2001/12/26 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2001 Dec;29(12):1439-47. doi: 10.1016/s0301-472x(01)00741-x.,,"['S0301472X0100741X [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-472x(01)00741-x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

We studied the effects of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) on the proliferation of clonogenic progenitors and bone marrow stroma from patients receiving cytokine-mobilized allogeneic stem cell transplants (SCT). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patient bone marrow mononuclear cells were studied at a minimum of 6 months after transplantation. Control and patient samples were divided into two fractions, one to establish the adherent stroma layers (SL) and the other to select for the progenitor population. SL from normal subjects or from patients were supplemented with 0 (control), 2, or 20 ng/mL bFGF in combination with heparan sulfate, and the resulting area of the dish covered by stroma was quantitated in each group. At 3 weeks of culture, a monocellular suspension was prepared by exposing SL to 0.1% trypsin. Cells then were cultured in the colony-forming unit fibroblast (CFU-F) assay, which was supplemented with 0 (control), 2, or 20 ng/mL bFGF. With the second fraction, CD34(+) cells were selected with paramagnetic beads, and 1 x 10(4) cells were incubated in cross-culture studies on preformed SL from patient or control origin (with or without the addition of bFGF). SL adherent CD34(+) cells were covered with agar and cultured for 6 days. Aggregates of >20 cells were scored as blastic colonies (CFU-bl). RESULTS: At 3 weeks of culture, the median surface area of dishes covered by monoloayers from 13 patients was 40% (range 10-50% vs normal 55%, range 30-60%; p = 0.00006) and improved significantly, matching control values, in dishes supplemented with bFGF. Addition of bFGF to stroma monolayers had no effect on the number of CFU-F in both patient and control samples. Selected CD34(+) cells from patients receiving transplants and cultured on normal stroma gave significantly fewer CFU-bl than control samples (median 36, range 3-121 vs 147, range 10-184; p = 0.006), but colony numbers corrected following exposure to bFGF. Normal CD34(+) cells proliferated poorly on stroma from patients (median CFU-bl 37.5, range 6-84; p = 0.02), but also expanded significantly following bFGF supplementation (104, range 6-117; p = 0.001).

In the present study, we investigated whether rituximab therapy may select for CD20(-) subclones. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Leukemic B-CLL cells were isolated from patients with B-CLL and sensitivity to rituximab-induced cell death was examined. Levels of CD20 protein and mRNA were determined using flow cytometry and real-time PCR, respectively. Clonality analyses of leukemic cells throughout rituximab therapy were performed by GeneScan analysis of patient clone specific rearrangements of the complementarity determining region III of the heavy chain immunoglobulin. RESULTS: Cytotoxicity of rituximab in vitro did not depend on the protein levels of CD20. During therapy with rituximab CD20(+) B-CLL cells were depleted and CD20(-) leukemic cells emerged. After treatment, the initial CD20(+) B-CLL cell clone reexpanded. CD20(-) B-CLL cells retained their capacity to synthesize the CD20 molecule. CONCLUSIONS: These data support the concept that in B-CLL rituximab treatment may not lead to the emergence of CD20(-) leukemic variants. Our findings support clinical studies investigating the benefit of prolonged period of rituximab therapy in B-CLL disease.","['Pickartz, T', 'Ringel, F', 'Wedde, M', 'Renz, H', 'Klein, A', 'von Neuhoff, N', 'Dreger, P', 'Kreuzer, K A', 'Schmidt, C A', 'Srock, S', 'Schoeler, D', 'Schriever, F']","['Pickartz T', 'Ringel F', 'Wedde M', 'Renz H', 'Klein A', 'von Neuhoff N', 'Dreger P', 'Kreuzer KA', 'Schmidt CA', 'Srock S', 'Schoeler D', 'Schriever F']","['Charite der Humboldt-Universitat zu Berlin, Campus Virchow-Klinikum, Medizinische Klinik mit Schwerpunkt Hamatologie und Onkologie, Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antigens, CD20)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)']",IM,,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived', 'Antigens, CD20/*genetics', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA Primers', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Rituximab', 'Transcription, Genetic']",2001/12/26 10:00,2002/01/25 10:01,['2001/12/26 10:00'],"['2001/12/26 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/25 10:01 [medline]', '2001/12/26 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2001 Dec;29(12):1410-6. doi: 10.1016/s0301-472x(01)00753-6.,,"['S0301472X01007536 [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-472x(01)00753-6 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the mode of action remains unclear. We previously reported that Cd-induced apoptosis was partly dependent on mitochondria. In the present study, we investigated the involvement of caspase-9, which is the apex caspase in the mitochondoria-dependent apoptosis pathway, in Cd-induced apoptosis in human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells. A specific inhibitor of caspase-9, Z-LEHD-FMK, partly inhibited DNA fragmentation induced by Cd treatment in HL-60 cells. Moreover, treatment of HL-60 cells with Cd resulted in the appearance of Cytochrome c (Cyt c), a potent activator of caspase-9, in the cytosol at 3 h, which closely paralleled the activation of caspase-9. Caspase-9 is an initiator caspase that is a potent activator of downstream effector caspases such as caspase-3. Caspase-3 activation was subsequent to the Cyt c release at 6 h. DNA fragmentation, an index of induction of apoptosis, also appeared 6 h after Cd treatment. The effects were more pronounced at 9 h after Cd addition. A broad-specificity inhibitor of caspases, Z-Asp-CH(2)-DCB, inhibited caspase-3 activation and DNA fragmentation induced by Cd in a dose-dependent fashion. The results suggest that Cd-induced apoptosis is partly caused by caspase-9 activation triggered by Cyt c.","['Kondoh, Masuo', 'Araragi, Saeko', 'Sato, Katsuya', 'Higashimoto, Minoru', 'Takiguchi, Masufumi', 'Sato, Masao']","['Kondoh M', 'Araragi S', 'Sato K', 'Higashimoto M', 'Takiguchi M', 'Sato M']","['Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Tokushima Bunri University, 180 Yamashiro-cho, 770-8514, Tokushima, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Ireland,Toxicology,Toxicology,0361055,"['0 (Cytochrome c Group)', '0 (Proteins)', '00BH33GNGH (Cadmium)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cadmium/*toxicity', 'Caspase 9', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cytochrome c Group/metabolism', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/enzymology', 'Proteins/metabolism']",2001/12/26 10:00,2002/02/01 10:01,['2001/12/26 10:00'],"['2001/12/26 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/01 10:01 [medline]', '2001/12/26 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Toxicology. 2002 Jan 15;170(1-2):111-7. doi: 10.1016/s0300-483x(01)00536-4.,,"['S0300483X01005364 [pii]', '10.1016/s0300-483x(01)00536-4 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), a technique of molecular cytogenetics, has played a pivotal role in the detection of unique sub-microscopic chromosomal rearrangements that helped in the identification of chromosomal loci, which contain genes involved in leukemogenesis. We studied the feasibility and sensitivity of the FISH technique for molecular analysis of translocations markers, t(9;22) and t(15;17) for accurate molecular diagnosis and for monitoring the disease in 21 patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) who received interferon-alpha and/or chemotherapy (7 patients), bone marrow transplantation (14 patients), and 14 patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) who received all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) and/or chemotherapy. We also applied conventional karyotyping (CK) for identification of t(9;22) and t(15;17) at diagnosis. All CML cases had a Ph; t(9;22) and except for two cases all APL had t(15;17). The FISH studies on CML marrows in complete cytogenetic remission (CCR) (100% Ph- by CK) achieved by IFN-alpha, showed 0-2.5% of cells with BCR-ABL fusion in first cytogenetic remission (Controls, range 0.5-1.5%). Repeat follow-up FISH studies could be done in two cases in remission, which demonstrated 0-10% of cells with BCR-ABL fusion. Evaluation of Ph positive status of CML marrow at diagnosis by CK (100% Ph+ cells) and FISH (80-92% BCR-ABL fusion) pointed the existence of dormant clone of normal residual hematopoietic cells along with actively proliferating clones of Ph positive cells. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis of post-BMT CML marrows in CCR (0% Ph+ mitoses) could detect MRD with range of 1-6%. Among 14 patients, 9 who showed percentage of BCR-ABL positive cells (0.0-1.5%) almost similar to normal controls, 6 patients had comparatively good prognosis (disease-free survival 7-14 months). Of five patients with residual leukemic cells in the range of 2-6%, 4 relapsed within a period of 3-24 months. Fourteen APL patients in CCR [100% t(15;17) negative cells by CK] were evaluated by FISH to check the presence of residual leukemic cells. In these patients FISH could efficiently detect 1-14.5% of residual cells with PML-RARA (patients mean MRD 5%, controls mean MRD 3.5%, P=.02). Since the time of FISH analysis, 5 to 7 patients with higher fraction of leukemic cells (5-11%) relapsed within a short period (1-7 months). On the contrary, 5 of 7 patients with either absence or low percentage of PML-RARA positive cells remained in complete remission for 11-24 months. Our data show that FISH has a potential to detect and measure the fraction of aberrant malignant cells in remission marrows, induced by BMT in CML and chemotherapy in APL. These findings encourage the investigations on a large scale to merit its potential for identification of patients at high risk. In the present studies, FISH on interphase cells also demonstrated its efficiency in the molecular diagnosis by its ability to detect BCR-ABL and PML-RARA fusion in CML with masked/variant Ph and t(15;17) negative APL, respectively. The efficiency of technique in molecular diagnosis was also proved in one of the CML patients who progressed to myeloid blastic phase where interphase FISH could identify an extra BCR-ABL fusion on both chromosomes 9 indicating insertion of BCR into ABL and its duplication.","['Amare, P S', 'Baisane, C', 'Saikia, T', 'Nair, R', 'Gawade, H', 'Advani, S']","['Amare PS', 'Baisane C', 'Saikia T', 'Nair R', 'Gawade H', 'Advani S']","['Cytogenetics Laboratory, Department of Medical Oncology, Tata Memorial Hospital, Parel, Mumbai-400012, India. pratibha@bom7.vsn1.net.in']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence/*methods', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*diagnosis/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",2001/12/26 10:00,2002/01/11 10:01,['2001/12/26 10:00'],"['2001/12/26 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/11 10:01 [medline]', '2001/12/26 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 2001 Dec;131(2):125-34. doi: 10.1016/s0165-4608(01)00504-0.,,"['S0165460801005040 [pii]', '10.1016/s0165-4608(01)00504-0 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we report that phosphorylation of Bcl-2 may be required for these protective effects. J774 cells overexpressing wild-type Bcl-2 resist oxidant-induced lysosomal leak as well as apoptosis, and this protection is amplified by pretreatment with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (which promotes protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent phosphorylation of Bcl-2). In contrast, cells overexpressing the Bcl-2 mutant S70A (which cannot be phosphorylated) are not protected in either circumstance. Transfection with Bcl-2(S70E), a constitutively active Bcl-2 mutant which does not require phosphorylation, is protective independent of PKC activation.

This delayed cell death may arise from activation of phospholipases, in particular phospholipase A2 (PLA2), which may destabilize lysosomal and mitochondrial membranes. Indeed, the secretory PLA2 (sPLA2) inhibitor 4-bromophenacyl bromide diminishes both delayed lysosomal rupture and apoptosis. Furthermore, sPLA2 activation by mellitin, or direct micro-injection of sPLA2, causes lysosomal rupture and apoptosis. Finally, B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) over-expression prevents oxidant-induced activation of PLA2, delayed lysosomal destabilization and apoptosis. This supports a causal association between PLA2 activation and delayed oxidant-induced cell death and suggests that Bcl-2 may suppress apoptosis by preventing PLA2 activation.","['Zhao, M', 'Brunk, U T', 'Eaton, J W']","['Zhao M', 'Brunk UT', 'Eaton JW']","['Division of Pathology II, Faculty of Health Sciences, Linkoping University, Sweden. ming.zhao@inr.liu.se']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,FEBS Lett,FEBS letters,0155157,"['0 (Oxidants)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '20449-79-0 (Melitten)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'EC 3.1.1.32 (Phospholipases A)', 'EC 3.1.1.4 (Group II Phospholipases A2)', 'EC 3.1.1.4 (Phospholipases A2)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression', 'Group II Phospholipases A2', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/*pharmacology', 'Intracellular Membranes/drug effects/metabolism', 'Lysosomes/drug effects/metabolism', 'Melitten/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Microinjections', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Oxidants/*pharmacology', 'Oxidative Stress/drug effects', 'Phospholipases A/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Phospholipases A2', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism', 'Time Factors']",2001/12/26 10:00,2002/01/26 10:01,['2001/12/26 10:00'],"['2001/12/26 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/26 10:01 [medline]', '2001/12/26 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,FEBS Lett. 2001 Dec 14;509(3):399-404. doi: 10.1016/s0014-5793(01)03184-2.,,"['S0014-5793(01)03184-2 [pii]', '10.1016/s0014-5793(01)03184-2 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

IRF4 has been suggested to be involved in tumorigenesis because the overexpression of IRF4 caused the transformation of Rat-1 fibroblasts in vitro. Here, we show that IRF4 is constitutively expressed in adult T-cell leukemia (ATL)-derived cell lines, which were infected with human T-cell leukemia virus type-I, but hardly expressed the trans-activator protein, Tax. Similarly, constitutive expression of IRF4 was demonstrated in freshly isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from patients with either acute or chronic ATL. However, the high-level expression of IRF4 was specifically associated with acute ATL. With mitogen-activated PBMC from healthy donors, cell cycle analyses revealed that the induction of IRF4 occurred prior to cell cycle progression and the cells that had entered the cell cycle were predominantly IRF4-positive cells. In addition, ectopic expression of IRF4 in Rat-1 fibroblasts increased the S and G2 / M phase population significantly.

The effects of mitogenic substances on both synthesis and distribution of GAGs in Jurkat, Daudi and THP-1, independently of their effect on cell proliferation, were studied. The secretion of CS and HS from Jurkat was significantly suppressed by using 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA), phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) and anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody (OKT3). These mitogens had different effect on the synthesis of cell-associated GAG by Jurkat, depending on the mitogen type. Addition of TPA or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in Daudi's culture medium resulted in increased synthesis of HS, while no effect on CS synthesis was noticed. Furthermore, in the presence of LPS, THP-1 produce slightly lower amounts of CS, whereas this mitogen significantly suppresses the HS synthesis in both culture medium and cell membrane.

Meyer.,S38-41,"Recently, there have been considerable efforts to search for naturally occurring substances that can inhibit, reverse, or retard the multi-stage carcinogenesis. A wide array of phenolic substances derived from edible and medicinal plants have been reported to possess anticarcinogenic and antimutagenic activities and in many cases, the chemopreventive activities of phytochemicals are associated with their anti-inflammatory and/or antioxidative properties. Panax ginseng C.A. Meyer cultivated in Korea has been widely used in traditional herbal medicine for the treatment of various diseases. Certain fractions or purified ingredients of ginseng have been shown to exert anticarcinogenic and antimutagenic activities. Our previous studies have revealed that the methanol extract of heat-processed Panax ginseng C.A. Meyer attenuates the lipid peroxidation in rat brain homogenates and is also capable of scavenging superoxide generated by xanthine- xanthine oxidase or by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) in differentiated human promyelocytic leukemia (HL-60) cells. Topical application of the same extract onto shaven backs of female ICR mice also suppressed TPA-induced skin tumor promotion. Likewise, topical application of ginsenoside Rg3, one of the constituents of heat-treated ginseng, significantly inhibited TPA-induced mouse epidermal ornithine decarboxylase activity and skin tumor promotion. Expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in TPA-stimulated mouse skin was markedly suppressed by Rg3 pretreatment. In addition, Rg3 inhibited TPA-stimulated activation of NF-kappaB and extracellular-regulated protein kinase (ERK), one of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase in mouse skin and also in cultured human breast epithelial cells (MCF-10A).","['Surh, Y J', 'Na, H K', 'Lee, J Y', 'Keum, Y S']","['Surh YJ', 'Na HK', 'Lee JY', 'Keum YS']","['College of Pharmacy, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea. surh@plaza.snu.ac.kr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Korea (South),J Korean Med Sci,Journal of Korean medical science,8703518,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*therapeutic use', 'Antioxidants', 'Heating', 'Humans', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Molecular Structure', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', '*Panax', 'Plant Extracts/*therapeutic use']",2001/12/19 10:00,2002/03/07 10:01,['2001/12/19 10:00'],"['2001/12/19 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/07 10:01 [medline]', '2001/12/19 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Korean Med Sci. 2001 Dec;16 Suppl:S38-41. doi: 10.3346/jkms.2001.16.S.S38.,,"['200112s038 [pii]', '10.3346/jkms.2001.16.S.S38 [doi]']",,17,,,,,PMC3202206,,,,,

We have previously used HPRT mutation as a biomarker to evaluate exposures to BD in a monomer production plant. We now report on a study of 49 workers in a styrene-butadiene rubber plant in which we used the concentration of the BD metabolite 1,2-dihydroxy-4-(N-acetylcysteinyl-S)-butane (M1) in urine as a biomarker of exposure and the frequency of HPRT variant (mutant) lymphocytes (Vf) as a biomarker of effect. Workers were assigned to high- and low-exposure groups based on historical information about work areas and jobs. Personal exposure to BD for one work shift was measured using a passive badge dosimeter. Each participant provided a urine specimen and blood sample at the end of the work shift and completed a questionnaire providing information on lifestyle, health, and work activities. The average BD exposures in the high- and low-exposure groups were significantly different, even after excluding two extreme values, (high 1.48 ppm; low 0.15 ppm, p < 0.002). This study was done in 1994 and 1995 before the establishment, in 1996, of the new permissible exposure limit of 1 ppm. Both the mean M1 and the HPRT Vf were more than three times greater in the high-exposure group than in the low-exposure group (p < 0.0005). The three end points correlated with each other, with sample correlation coefficients between 0.4 and 0.6. The correlations among BD exposure and the biomarkers of internal exposure and genotoxicity suggest that occupational exposure to BD, in the range of 1-3 ppm, may be associated with adverse biological effects.","['Ammenheuser, M M', 'Bechtold, W E', 'Abdel-Rahman, S Z', 'Rosenblatt, J I', 'Hastings-Smith, D A', 'Ward, J B Jr']","['Ammenheuser MM', 'Bechtold WE', 'Abdel-Rahman SZ', 'Rosenblatt JI', 'Hastings-Smith DA', 'Ward JB Jr']","['Division of Environmental Toxicology, Department of Preventive Medicine and Community Health, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, Texas 77555-1110, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Environ Health Perspect,Environmental health perspectives,0330411,"['0 (1,2-dihydroxy-4-(N-acetylcysteinyl)butane)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Butadienes)', '0 (Carcinogens)', '9006-04-6 (Rubber)', 'EC 2.4.2.8 (Hypoxanthine Phosphoribosyltransferase)', 'JSD5FGP5VD (1,3-butadiene)', 'WYQ7N0BPYC (Acetylcysteine)']",IM,,"['Acetylcysteine/*analogs & derivatives/*urine', 'Adult', 'Biomarkers/*analysis', 'Butadienes/*adverse effects/analysis', 'Carcinogens/*adverse effects/analysis', 'Chemical Industry', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Humans', 'Hypoxanthine Phosphoribosyltransferase/*genetics', 'Lymphocytes', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Occupational Exposure', 'Rubber']",2001/12/19 10:00,2002/02/06 10:01,['2001/12/19 10:00'],"['2001/12/19 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/06 10:01 [medline]', '2001/12/19 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Environ Health Perspect. 2001 Dec;109(12):1249-55. doi: 10.1289/ehp.011091249.,,"['sc271_5_1835 [pii]', '10.1289/ehp.011091249 [doi]']",,,,,,"['ES06015/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'ES06676/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'ES07148/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']",PMC1240507,,,,,

We aimed to determine and assess the risk factors associated with this disease. METHODS: From 1984 to 1992, we investigated known and suspected risk factors for common acute lymphoblastic leukaemia diagnosed in a population-based case-control study of children aged 0-14 years in Western Australia. 83 children in the study group came from the sole referral centre for paediatric cancer in the state and 166 controls matched for age and sex were recruited through a postal survey of people randomly selected from the state electoral roll. We interviewed mothers of 83 study and 166 control children (82% and 74%, respectively, of those eligible). Fathers completed a self-administered questionnaire. FINDINGS: We recorded a protective association between iron or folate supplementation in pregnancy and risk of common acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in the child (odds ratio 0.37 [95% CI 0.21-0.65]; p=0.001). For iron alone, the odds ratio was 0.75 (0.37-1.51); only one mother took folate without iron. Further analyses of folate use with or without iron (0.40; 0.21-0.73) showed that the protective effect varies little by time of first use of supplements or for how long they were taken. The association was not weakened by adjustment for potentially confounding variables.

METHODS: A retrospective review was made of the clinical charts of all patients who developed positive S. prolificans cultures in our centre from 1990 to 2000. Isolates were identified by colonial morphology and microscopic features. The in vitro susceptibility was evaluated using the microdilution method according to NCCLS. RESULTS: S. prolificans was isolated in 15 patients. Eight were affected with cystic fibrosis and the isolation of S. prolificans in their airways did not worsen their clinical status. Among the remaining 7 cases there were five leukemic patients with neutropenia and two immunocompetent hosts with cutaneous infection and endocarditis. Four of five neutropenic patients died of sudden sepsis and S. prolificans was isolated from blood cultures made a few days before their death, and the fifth neutropenic case suffered a bilateral pneumonia with improving course probably due to recovery from neutropenia. As to the immunocompetent group the clinical course was good in the cutaneous infection case, but the endocarditis case died four days after the antifungical therapy was started. All the isolates tested were found to be resistant to amphotericin, 5 flucytosine, fluconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, miconazole and terbinafine. CONCLUSIONS: Scedosporium prolificans is a fungal pathogen that colonizes the airways of patients affected with cystic fibrosis. It can also cause a wide variety of infections, whose severity and prognosis depends on the patients immune status. Due to the resistance of this fungus to antifungal drugs, the therapeutic options are limited. Only with the correction of neutropenia and surgery in local infections in immunocompetent hosts it has been possible to cure these infections.","['Lopez, L', 'Gaztelurrutia, L', 'Cuenca-Estrella, M', 'Monzon, A', 'Barron, J', 'Hernandez, J L', 'Perez, R']","['Lopez L', 'Gaztelurrutia L', 'Cuenca-Estrella M', 'Monzon A', 'Barron J', 'Hernandez JL', 'Perez R']","['Servicio de Microbiologia, Hospital de Cruces, Baracaldo, Vizcaya.']",['spa'],"['Case Reports', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Spain,Enferm Infecc Microbiol Clin,Enfermedades infecciosas y microbiologia clinica,9104081,['0 (Antifungal Agents)'],IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antifungal Agents/therapeutic use', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cystic Fibrosis/complications', 'Disease Susceptibility', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple, Fungal', 'Endocarditis/etiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunocompetence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/complications', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mycetoma/drug therapy/*epidemiology/microbiology', 'Neutropenia/complications', 'Opportunistic Infections/epidemiology/microbiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Scedosporium/drug effects/*isolation & purification/ultrastructure', 'Spain/epidemiology', 'Wound Infection/microbiology']",2001/12/19 10:00,2002/02/15 10:01,['2001/12/19 10:00'],"['2001/12/19 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/15 10:01 [medline]', '2001/12/19 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Enferm Infecc Microbiol Clin. 2001 Aug-Sep;19(7):308-13. doi: 10.1016/s0213-005x(01)72651-1.,,"['13018479 [pii]', '10.1016/s0213-005x(01)72651-1 [doi]']",,37,Infeccion y colonizacion por Scedosporium prolificans.,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Eighteen malignant hematopoietic cell lines and 10 leukemia blasts from leukemia patients were examined by flow cytometry for the expression of Flt3 receptor before and after incubation with DXM 0.1 micromol/L for 24 h. The effect of DXM on the proliferation of malignant hematopoietic cells was measured by MTT assay. RESULTS: (1) Expression of the Flt3 receptor in malignant hematopoietic cell lines and leukemia blasts was widespread and extremely heterogeneous; (2) The presence of receptor on the surface of malignant hematopoietic cell didn't necessarily imply a significant ligand-induced response, at least in terms of proliferation. Conversely, some Flt3 receptor-negative malignant hematopoietic cells responded to rhFL; (3) DXM down-regulated the expression of Flt3 receptor and inhibited the proliferation induced by rhFL in some malignant hematopoietic cell lines and fresh leukemia cells. CONCLUSION: DXM may down-regulate the expression of Flt3 receptor on the surface of malignant hematopoietic cells and inhibit the proliferation induced by rhFL. A combination of rhFL and DXM may serve to control hematopoietic defects in malignant hematopoietic diseases.","['Xu, Z X', 'Xu, Y', 'Zhu, J K', 'Li, C X', 'Li, Y', 'Zhang, X G']","['Xu ZX', 'Xu Y', 'Zhu JK', 'Li CX', 'Li Y', 'Zhang XG']","['Department of Immunology, Medical Biotechnology Institute, School of Life Science, Soochow University, Suzhou 215007, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Acta Pharmacol Sin,Acta pharmacologica Sinica,100956087,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (flt3 ligand protein)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-1)']",IM,,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal/*pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Dexamethasone/*pharmacology', 'Hematopoiesis/drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/pathology', 'Membrane Proteins/*pharmacology', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/metabolism', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-1/*biosynthesis']",2001/12/19 10:00,2003/06/19 05:00,['2001/12/19 10:00'],"['2001/12/19 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/19 05:00 [medline]', '2001/12/19 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Acta Pharmacol Sin. 2001 Jun;22(6):534-40.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we show that Tax is capable of activating the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV-TK) promoter in certain mammalian cell lines. In murine NIH 3T3 fibroblasts and human HeLa cells, trans-activation by Tax was remarkably strong, whereas in human chondrocytic HCS-2/8 and monkey kidney Cos-7 cells, the responsiveness of the TK promoter to Tax was poor. Deletion analysis revealed that one of the two previously described Sp1 sites is required for the Tax responsiveness, whereas the CTF binding site is not. The results suggest possible interactions between the oncogenic Tax protein and the viral TK in coinfected cells in vivo. Care should be taken in the context of HTLV-I research, as the HSV-TK promoter has been widely used in molecular biology and gene therapeutics.","['Kubota, S', 'Mukudai, Y', 'Hattori, T', 'Eguchi, T', 'Kondo, S', 'Takigawa, M']","['Kubota S', 'Mukudai Y', 'Hattori T', 'Eguchi T', 'Kondo S', 'Takigawa M']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Dentistry, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine and Dentistry, Okayama, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,DNA Cell Biol,DNA and cell biology,9004522,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)', 'EC 2.7.1.21 (Thymidine Kinase)']",IM,,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'COS Cells', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Gene Products, tax/*genetics', 'Genes, pX/*genetics', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Mice', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Simplexvirus/*genetics', 'Thymidine Kinase/*genetics', '*Transcriptional Activation']",2001/12/19 10:00,2002/01/10 10:01,['2001/12/19 10:00'],"['2001/12/19 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/10 10:01 [medline]', '2001/12/19 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,DNA Cell Biol. 2001 Sep;20(9):563-8. doi: 10.1089/104454901317094972.,,['10.1089/104454901317094972 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Neuronal apoptosis in glaucoma is primarily associated with high intraocular pressure caused by chronically impaired outflow of aqueous humor through the trabecular meshwork, a reticulum of mitotically inactive endothelial-like cells located in the angle of the anterior chamber. Anatomic, genetic, and expression profiling data suggest the possibility of using gene transfer to treat glaucomatous intraocular pressure dysregulation, but this approach will require stable genetic modification of the differentiated aqueous outflow tract. We injected transducing unit-normalized preparations of either of two lentiviral vectors or an oncoretroviral vector as a single bolus into the aqueous circulation of cultured human donor eyes, under perfusion conditions that mimicked natural anterior chamber flow and maintained viability ex vivo. Reporter gene expression was assessed in trabecular meshwork from 3 to 16 days after infusion of 1.0 x 10(8) transducing units of each vector. The oncoretroviral vector failed to transduce the trabecular meshwork. In contrast, feline immunodeficiency virus and human immunodeficiency virus vectors produced efficient, localized transduction of the trabecular meshwork in situ. The results demonstrate that lentiviral vectors permit efficient genetic modification of the human trabecular meshwork when delivered via the afferent aqueous circulation, a clinically accessible route. In addition, controlled comparisons in this study establish that feline and human immunodeficiency virus vectors are equivalently efficacious in delivering genes to this terminally differentiated human tissue.","['Loewen, N', 'Fautsch, M P', 'Peretz, M', 'Bahler, C K', 'Cameron, J D', 'Johnson, D H', 'Poeschla, E M']","['Loewen N', 'Fautsch MP', 'Peretz M', 'Bahler CK', 'Cameron JD', 'Johnson DH', 'Poeschla EM']","['Molecular Medicine Program, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Hum Gene Ther,Human gene therapy,9008950,['38966-21-1 (Aphidicolin)'],IM,,"['Aged', 'Animals', 'Aphidicolin/pharmacology', 'Aqueous Humor/metabolism', 'Cats', 'Cell Division', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes, Reporter/genetics', 'Genetic Vectors/*genetics', 'Glaucoma/*genetics/*therapy', 'HIV-1/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunodeficiency Virus, Feline/genetics', 'Lac Operon/genetics', 'Lentivirus/*genetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics', 'Mice', 'Middle Aged', 'Organ Culture Techniques', 'Organ Specificity', 'Trabecular Meshwork/drug effects/*metabolism/pathology/*virology', 'Transduction, Genetic/*methods', 'Transgenes/genetics']",2001/12/19 10:00,2002/02/08 10:01,['2001/12/19 10:00'],"['2001/12/19 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/08 10:01 [medline]', '2001/12/19 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Hum Gene Ther. 2001 Nov 20;12(17):2109-19. doi: 10.1089/10430340152677449.,,['10.1089/10430340152677449 [doi]'],,,,,,"['AI47536/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'EY07065/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The radiofrequency (RF) energy was delivered via a coaxial applicator to a perfused chamber where cells adherent to a thin glass coverslip were imaged by laser scanning confocal microscopy. Cell calcium concentration, estimated from Fluo-3 fluorescence, was monitored over two 10-min periods; control followed by exposed/sham, with exposure status assigned in a blind and randomized fashion. Both continuous wave (CW) and pulsed wave (PW) RF (on both phytohaemagglutanin-activated and unactivated cells) were studied (with an equal number of sham exposures) on 100 cells per category (total 800 cells). RESULTS: No significant changes were noted for the following: regression slope of calcium fluorescence; mean calcium concentration; number of calcium 'spikes' in each 10 min; or mean height of these 'spikes'. The average frequency from Fourier spectra of these periods showed significant alteration in one category only: PW exposure of activated cells.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Yields of chromosome aberrations following X-irradiation were determined in Giemsa-stained metaphases. Cell cycle phase distributions were determined by BrdU incorporation and microscopy, apoptosis was assessed by caspase assays. Telomerase activity (TRAP assay), telomere length (Q-FISH and Southern blotting) and telomere function (Robertsonian-like fusion formation) were also examined. The expression levels of telomerase components, telomerase regulators and DNA PKcs were determined on Northern blots. RESULTS: A total of 4.5-7.6-fold elevated chromosome aberration yields were found in 7926 by comparison with 8709 3-24h after 0.5 and 1 Gy X-ray exposure. This difference could not be accounted for by differences in chromatid break-rejoining rates, cell cycle phase distribution or the induction of apoptosis. Telomeres and telomerase were dysfunctional in 7926. However, average telomere length was approximately two-fold greater than in 8709. CONCLUSION: Defective telomere function in 7926 correlates with chromosomal radiosensitivity. This implicates telomere function in addition to telomere length as a determinant of chromosomal radiosensitivity.","['Finnon, P', 'Wong, H P', 'Silver, A R', 'Slijepcevic, P', 'Bouffler, S D']","['Finnon P', 'Wong HP', 'Silver AR', 'Slijepcevic P', 'Bouffler SD']","['National Radiological Protection Board, Chilton, Didcot X11 ORQ, UK. paul.finnon@nrpb.org.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Int J Radiat Biol,International journal of radiation biology,8809243,"['0 (Oligonucleotides)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Chromosomes/*radiation effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Electrophoresis, Agar Gel', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*radiotherapy', 'Metaphase', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Mitosis', 'Oligonucleotides/pharmacology', 'Phenotype', '*Radiation Tolerance', 'S Phase', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Telomerase/metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'X-Rays']",2001/12/19 10:00,2002/01/10 10:01,['2001/12/19 10:00'],"['2001/12/19 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/10 10:01 [medline]', '2001/12/19 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Radiat Biol. 2001 Dec;77(12):1151-62. doi: 10.1080/09553000110075220.,,['10.1080/09553000110075220 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

We found that verapamil reversed resistance of CEM/VLB(100) cells to vinblastine and fluorescein-colchicine, but not to colchicine. Chlorpromazine reversed resistance to vinblastine but not to fluorescein-colchicine, and it increased resistance to colchicine. Initial influx rates of fluorescein-colchicine were similar in resistant and parental cells, whereas vinblastine uptake was about 10-fold lower in the resistant cells. These results provide indirect evidence that fluorescein-colchicine is transported from the inner leaflet of the membrane and vinblastine from the outer membrane leaflet. Verapamil inhibited fluorescein-colchicine transport in inside-out vesicles made from resistant cells, whilst chlorpromazine was found to activate the transport of fluorescein-colchicine. The chlorpromazine-induced activation of fluorescein-colchicine transport was temperature-dependent and may reflect its interaction with phospholipids localised in the same bilayer leaflet. Conversely, chlorpromazine localisation in this leaflet may be responsible for its allosteric inhibition of vinblastine transport from the opposing membrane leaflet. The proposed relationship between the selectivity of modulation of P-glycoprotein and the membrane localisation of the cytotoxic drug substrates and modulators may have important implications in the rational design of regimes for the circumvention of multidrug resistance clinically.","['Bebawy, M', 'Morris, M B', 'Roufogalis, B D']","['Bebawy M', 'Morris MB', 'Roufogalis BD']","['Faculty of Pharmacy, The University of Sydney, N.S.W 2006, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Calcium Channel Blockers)', '0 (Fluoresceins)', '0 (Membrane Lipids)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Phospholipids)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', '66091-34-7 (fluorescein colchicine)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)', 'SML2Y3J35T (Colchicine)', 'U42B7VYA4P (Chlorpromazine)']",IM,,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', 'Allosteric Regulation', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Biological Transport, Active/drug effects', 'Calcium Channel Blockers/*pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Membrane/drug effects', 'Chlorpromazine/*pharmacology', 'Colchicine/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/pharmacology', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Fluoresceins/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Membrane Lipids/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', 'Phospholipids/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/pathology', 'Temperature', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism', 'Verapamil/*pharmacology', 'Vinblastine/metabolism/*pharmacology']",2001/12/19 10:00,2002/02/22 10:01,['2001/12/19 10:00'],"['2001/12/19 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/22 10:01 [medline]', '2001/12/19 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 2001 Dec 14;85(12):1998-2003. doi: 10.1054/bjoc.2001.2184.,,"['10.1054/bjoc.2001.2184 [doi]', 'S0007092001921846 [pii]']",,,,,,,PMC2364021,,,,,

Comprehensive analysis of the chromosomal rearrangements in these complex karyotypes has been hampered by the limitations of conventional cytogenetics. As a result, our knowledge concerning the cytogenetics of these malignancies is sparse. Here we describe a multiplex-FISH (M-FISH) study of CCAs in 36 patients with AML and MDS. M-FISH generated a genome-wide analysis of chromosomal aberrations in CCAs, establishing several cytogenetic subgroups. -5/5q- was demonstrated in the majority of patients (86%). Other rearrangements (present with or without -5/5q-) included: deletion of 7q (47%), 3q rearrangements (19%), and MLL copy gain or amplification (17%). These genetic subgroups seem to display biological heterogeneity: MLL copy gain or amplification in association with 5q- was detected only in AML patients and was significantly associated with extremely short survival (median overall survival: 30 days, P = 0.0102). A partially cryptic t(4;5)(q31;q31), a balanced t(1;8)(p31;q22), and an unbalanced der(7)t(7;14)(q21;q13) were detected as possible new recurrent rearrangements in association with CCAs. Novel reciprocal translocations included t(5;11)(q33;p15)del(5)(q13q31) and t(3;6)(q26;q25).

Their sensitive and unequivocal detection is therefore of great clinical importance. In this report, we describe the establishment of an interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assay that complements classical cytogenetic analysis in the diagnosis of such aberrations. PACs that map centromeric and telomeric of known 3q21 breakpoints were labeled with different fluorescent dyes, and the separation of the normally colocalizing signals was used as an indicator of the presence of a 3q21 rearrangement. Two cell lines and 10 primary samples from myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients with 3q21 rearrangements were investigated using the newly established method. The rate of false positivity was determined in 27 control samples from patients with various types of myeloid malignancies. In addition to providing a sensitive and rapid test for the detection of 3q21 aberrations, the interphase FISH assay yields preliminary information about the localization of individual breakpoints. Six of the 10 breakpoints in the patient samples map to an only recently described breakpoint cluster region (BCR) 60 kb centromeric of the originally reported 3q21 BCR. These findings may contribute to the understanding of the molecular basis of the clinical features associated with 3q21 rearrangements.","['Wieser, R', 'Schreiner, U', 'Pirc-Danoewinata, H', 'Aytekin, M', 'Schmidt, H H', 'Rieder, H', 'Fonatsch, C']","['Wieser R', 'Schreiner U', 'Pirc-Danoewinata H', 'Aytekin M', 'Schmidt HH', 'Rieder H', 'Fonatsch C']","['Institut fur Medizinische Biologie, Universitat Wien, Wien, Austria. rotraud.wieser@univie.ac.at']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,['0 (DNA Probes)'],IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Child', 'Chromosome Breakage/genetics', '*Chromosome Inversion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 3/*genetics', 'DNA Probes/genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', '*In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence/methods', 'Interphase/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics/pathology', 'Translocation, Genetic/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/12/18 10:00,2002/01/11 10:01,['2001/12/18 10:00'],"['2001/12/18 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/11 10:01 [medline]', '2001/12/18 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2001 Dec;32(4):373-80. doi: 10.1002/gcc.1202.,,"['10.1002/gcc.1202 [pii]', '10.1002/gcc.1202 [doi]']",,,,"['Copyright 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,

Inhibition of the BCR/ABL kinase activity in the BV173 CML cell line with STI571 resulted in a significant overexpression of a 10-kb novel mRNA, found to be the human ortholog of the murine Bach2, a B-cell-specific transcription factor. The human BACH2 cDNA is >9,120 bp long and includes an open reading frame of 2,526 bp encoding a protein with a basic leucine zipper (bZip) and a BTB/POZ domain, mediating DNA-binding and heterodimerization. BACH2 was consistently upregulated (2-10-fold) in all 10 Ph+ lymphoid lines tested following BCR/ABL inhibition. In CML myeloid cell lines (n = 8) and BCR/ABL-negative lines (n = 6), BACH2 was either undetectable by Northern blotting or did not change in response to STI571, suggesting that BACH2 repression by BCR/ABL may be specifically relevant to lymphoid transformation. Quantitative RT/PCR revealed a significantly lower level of BACH2 expression in leukocytes from patients with CML (n = 24) as compared to normal individuals (n = 23) (P < 0.0005). Moreover, CD34+ cells treated in vitro with STI571 exhibited a consistent upregulation of BACH2 in 8 of 10 CMLs but in none of the 9 normal individuals tested. Transcription regulation of BACH2 in BCR/ABL-positive cells was exerted via the MEK pathways, as shown by their responses to the U0126-specific inhibitor. Radiation hybrid mapping and FISH revealed that BACH2 is located on chromosome 6, band q15, a region frequently associated with deletions in ALL and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, suggesting its possible role as a tumor suppressor gene. However, no rearrangement or loss of signal was observed by Southern blotting in 34 lymphomas, 10 B-cell ALLs, or seven reactive lymph nodes. The pattern of BACH2 expression in BCR/ABL-positive cells suggests that transcriptional repression by this regulator is impaired in CML and may contribute to the emergence of lymphoid blast crisis.","['Vieira, S A', 'Deininger, M W', 'Sorour, A', 'Sinclair, P', 'Foroni, L', 'Goldman, J M', 'Melo, J V']","['Vieira SA', 'Deininger MW', 'Sorour A', 'Sinclair P', 'Foroni L', 'Goldman JM', 'Melo JV']","['Department of Haematology, Imperial College School of Medicine, Hammersmith Hospital, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,"['0 (BACH2 protein, human)', '0 (Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 6/genetics', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Exons', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics/physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Rearrangement/genetics', 'Genes, abl/*physiology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Introns', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/genetics', 'Signal Transduction/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/biosynthesis/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/*genetics']",2001/12/18 10:00,2002/01/11 10:01,['2001/12/18 10:00'],"['2001/12/18 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/11 10:01 [medline]', '2001/12/18 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2001 Dec;32(4):353-63. doi: 10.1002/gcc.1200.,,"['10.1002/gcc.1200 [pii]', '10.1002/gcc.1200 [doi]']",,,,"['Copyright 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,

In this respect, the t(9;22)(q34;q11) that results in the BCR/ABL fusion gene in chronic myeloid leukemia is one of the best-studied examples. The fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) gene at 8p11 encodes a transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase and is similarly activated by chromosomal translocations, in which three alternative genes-ZNF198 at 13q12, CEP110 at 9q34, and FOP at 6q27-become fused to the tyrosine kinase domain of FGFR1. These 8p11-translocations are associated with characteristic morphologic and clinical features, referred to as ""8p11 MPS."" In this study, we report the isolation and characterization of a novel fusion gene in a hematologic malignancy with a t(8;22)(p11;q11) and features suggestive of 8p11 MPS. We show that the breakpoints in the t(8;22) occur within introns 4 and 8 of the BCR and FGFR1 genes, respectively. On the mRNA level, the t(8;22) results in the fusion of BCR exons 1-4 in-frame with the tyrosine kinase domain of FGFR1 as well as in the expression of a reciprocal FGFR1/BCR chimeric transcript. By analogy with data obtained from previously characterized fusion genes involving FGFR1 and BCR/ABL, it is likely that the oligomerization domain contributed by BCR is critical and that its dimerizing properties lead to aberrant FGFR1 signaling and neoplastic transformation.","['Fioretos, T', 'Panagopoulos, I', 'Lassen, C', 'Swedin, A', 'Billstrom, R', 'Isaksson, M', 'Strombeck, B', 'Olofsson, T', 'Mitelman, F', 'Johansson, B']","['Fioretos T', 'Panagopoulos I', 'Lassen C', 'Swedin A', 'Billstrom R', 'Isaksson M', 'Strombeck B', 'Olofsson T', 'Mitelman F', 'Johansson B']","['Department of Clinical Genetics, Lund University Hospital, Sweden.

We studied the effect of the plant extract Justicia spicigera (Acanthaceae) in different haematopoietic cells: human leukaemic cell lines, umbilical cord blood cells, and mouse bone marrow cells. By examining colony formation and performing the MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) assay it was shown that the plant extract of Justicia spicigera contains cytotoxic factors for leukaemic cells and has no proliferative activity on normal haematopoietic progenitor cells. Our results show that this plant extract induces apoptosis in the human leukaemia cell line TF-1, but not in the bcl-2 transfectant cell line TB-1. Similar results were obtained using a haemopoietic cell line 32D and 32DBcl2. The cultures of umbilical cord blood cells and mouse bone marrow that contain granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) do not proliferate or become terminally differentiated in the presence of the infusion of Justicia spicigera. GM-CSF that acts by abrogating programmed cell death is not sufficient to inhibit the apoptotic stimulus in TF-1 and 32D cells. Moreover mouse fibroblasts (3T3) and two cervical carcinoma cell lines CALO and INBL, undergo apoptosis in the presence of different concentrations of an infusion from the plant. Our data show that there is a strong correlation between the cytotoxic effect and cell proliferation. Together, these results indicate that the plant infusion of Justicia spicigera does not contain any haematopoietic activity, induces apoptosis inhibited by bcl-2 and is linked to cell proliferation.","['Caceres-Cortes, J R', 'Cantu-Garza, F A', 'Mendoza-Mata, M T', 'Chavez-Gonzalez, M A', 'Ramos-Mandujano, G', 'Zambrano-Ramirez, I R']","['Caceres-Cortes JR', 'Cantu-Garza FA', 'Mendoza-Mata MT', 'Chavez-Gonzalez MA', 'Ramos-Mandujano G', 'Zambrano-Ramirez IR']","['Research Unit of Cell Differentiation and Cancer, Faculty of Professional Studies-Zaragoza, National Autonomous University of Mexico, FES-Zaragoza, UNAM, Mexico. cortesj@servidor.unam.mx']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Phytother Res,Phytotherapy research : PTR,8904486,"['0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)']",IM,,"['*Acanthaceae', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Bone Marrow Cells/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle/*drug effects', 'Female', 'Fetal Blood/cytology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'In Situ Nick-End Labeling', 'Male', 'Mice', '*Phytotherapy', 'Plant Extracts/*toxicity', 'Plant Structures', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",2001/12/18 10:00,2002/02/20 10:01,['2001/12/18 10:00'],"['2001/12/18 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/20 10:01 [medline]', '2001/12/18 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Phytother Res. 2001 Dec;15(8):691-7. doi: 10.1002/ptr.791.,,"['10.1002/ptr.791 [pii]', '10.1002/ptr.791 [doi]']",,,,"['Copyright 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']",,,,,,,,

Unlike parental cells, HL-525 cells are PKC-beta deficient and resistant to PMA-induced apoptosis. These cells regain susceptibility to apoptosis induction after transfection with a PKC-beta expression vector. By using this vector and specific neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), it was established that PMA-induced apoptosis also called for an interaction between cell-surface alpha(5)beta(1)-integrin and its deposited ligand fibronectin (FN), which is downstream of PKC-beta activation. Experiments with mAbs, the PKC-beta vector, and exogenous FN revealed that the next step entailed an interaction between secreted tumor necrosis factor-alpha and its type I receptor. By using a sphingomyelinase inhibitor, it was concluded that the subsequent step involved ceramide production. Moreover, a permeable ceramide was effective in inducing apoptosis in both HL-60 and HL-525 cells, and this induction was caspase-1 and/or -4 dependent because an inhibitor of these caspases abrogated the induced apoptosis. Based on these and related differentiation studies, we conclude that the above signaling events, the early ones in particular, are shared with PMA-induced macrophage differentiation in the HL-60 cells. It is likely that once these cells acquire their macrophage phenotype and perform their tasks, they become superfluous and are eliminated from the body by a self-triggered apoptotic process that involves our proposed signaling scheme.","['Laouar, A', 'Glesne, D', 'Huberman, E']","['Laouar A', 'Glesne D', 'Huberman E']","['Gene Expression and Function Group, Biochip Technology Center, Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, Illinois 60439-4833, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Carcinog,Molecular carcinogenesis,8811105,"['0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (Fibronectins)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Phorbol Esters)', '0 (Receptors, Fibronectin)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C beta)']",IM,,"['*Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Carcinogens/pharmacology', 'Fibronectins/*metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Phorbol Esters/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase C/*metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C beta', 'Receptors, Fibronectin/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects']",2001/12/18 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/12/18 10:00'],"['2001/12/18 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/12/18 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Carcinog. 2001 Dec;32(4):195-205. doi: 10.1002/mc.10012.,,"['10.1002/mc.10012 [pii]', '10.1002/mc.10012 [doi]']",,,,"['Copyright 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,['CA 80826/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,

In this study, the copy number of HMG-CoA reductase mRNA was determined in solid tumor and leukemic cell lines using competitive reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Reductase mRNA was increased about eight-fold in Caco2 human colon adenocarcinoma cells compared with that in CCD18 normal colon cells. We also found a 50-fold enhancement of reductase mRNA in stimulated human lymphocytes compared with unstimulated cells. In CEM human leukemia cells, reductase mRNA was increased 8.6 times compared with that in stimulated lymphocytes. Greater low density lipoprotein receptor mRNA was also observed in tumor cells compared with normal counterparts. We hypothesized that elevated reductase mRNA was due to attenuation of sterol-mediated control of tumor reductase promoter activity. We first compared the methylation status of CpG dinucleotides in the promoters of reductase and p16 tumor suppressor genes from solid tumor, leukemic, and normal cells. As reported for other tumor cells the p16 promoter region was hypermethylated in Caco2 and CEM cells but was hypomethylated in corresponding normal cells. However, reductase promoter sequences in both normal and tumor cells were hypomethylated, demonstrating that methylation is not involved in sterol-independent reductase regulation. We addressed altered transcription factor binding to the tumor cell reductase promoter by transiently transfecting Caco2 and CCD18 with a plasmid vector containing a hamster HMG-CoA reductase promoter fused to the luciferase gene. We found that increased reductase mRNA was partially due to an approximately three-fold higher reductase promoter activity in Caco2 than in CCD18, measured by luciferase reporter assays. Thus, differential binding of transcription factor or factors on the tumor cell reductase promoter attenuates normal sterol-mediated regulation of reductase activity.","['Hentosh, P', 'Yuh, S H', 'Elson, C E', 'Peffley, D M']","['Hentosh P', 'Yuh SH', 'Elson CE', 'Peffley DM']","['Department of Pharmacology, University of Health Sciences, Kansas City, Missouri 64106, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Carcinog,Molecular carcinogenesis,8811105,"['0 (Sterols)', 'EC 1.1.1.- (Hydroxymethylglutaryl CoA Reductases)']",IM,,"['Adenocarcinoma/*enzymology/genetics', 'Animals', 'Caco-2 Cells', 'Colonic Neoplasms/*enzymology/genetics', 'Cricetinae', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic/*drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Hydroxymethylglutaryl CoA Reductases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Sterols/*metabolism', 'Transfection']",2001/12/18 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/12/18 10:00'],"['2001/12/18 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/12/18 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Carcinog. 2001 Nov;32(3):154-66. doi: 10.1002/mc.1074.,,"['10.1002/mc.1074 [pii]', '10.1002/mc.1074 [doi]']",,,,"['Copyright 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,"['CA 73418/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 81756/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,

This study was designed to compare the yield of CD3(+), CD3(+)4(+), CD3(+)8(+), CD19(+), CD3(-)56(+)16(+), and CD34(+) cells contained in apheresis products from 61 consecutive non-cytokine treated, human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched donors for lymphocyte collection with the corresponding apheresis-derived cell yield from 112 consecutive, HLA-matched donors for blood stem cell collection who received recombinant human granulocyte colony stimulating factor (rhG-CSF, filgrastim) 6 microg/kg every 12 hours until cell collection was completed. Apheresis was started on day 4 or 5 of rhG-CSF treatment. The yield of lymphoid subsets was significantly different in the two sample groups, rhG-CSF treated product yields exceeding untreated product yields by a median of 2.1-fold (range: 1.3-2.6). However, the CD34(+) cell yield in rhG-CSF-treated apheresis products exceeded untreated products by 26-fold. A single untreated apheresis procedure was usually sufficient to collect a target dose of 1 x 10(8)/kg CD3(+) cells. Untreated apheresis products contained a median of 0.2 x 10(6)/kg CD34(+) cells. A potential engraftment dose of > or =0.5 x 10(6) CD34(+) cells per kg of recipient body weight was contained in 16% of 57 untreated apheresis products. One single apheresis performed in a normal, untreated donor provides a sufficient amount of CD3(+) cells for adoptive immunotherapy. Compared with that of an rhG-CSF stimulated apheresis product, the CD34(+) cell count is usually, but not always, below the engraftment dose range. RhG-CSF treatment has little effect on the yield of lymphoid subsets collected by apheresis but is highly selective of the release of CD34(+) cells.

In this study we utilized the placental alkaline phosphatase (PLAP) minigene, miniPLAP, and replaced its native 3' end-sequence encoding omega-2 to the C-terminus with the corresponding C-terminal sequences of nine other human GPI-anchored proteins. The resulting chimeras then were fed into an in vitro processing microsomal system where the cleavages leading to mature product from the nascent preproprotein could be followed by resolution on an SDS-PAGE system after immunoprecipitation. The results showed that the native signal of each protein differed markedly with respect to transamidation efficiency, with the signals of three proteins out-performing the others in GPI-anchor addition and those of two proteins being poorer substrates for the GPI transamidase. The data additionally indicated that the hierarchical order of efficiency of transamidation did not depend solely on the combination of permissible residues at omega-->omega + 2.","['Chen, R', 'Knez, J J', 'Merrick, W C', 'Medof, M E']","['Chen R', 'Knez JJ', 'Merrick WC', 'Medof ME']","['Institute of Pathology, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio 44106, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,"['0 (Glycosylphosphatidylinositols)', '0 (Pregnancy Proteins)', '0 (Protein Precursors)', '0 (Protein Sorting Signals)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', 'EC 3.1.3.- (miniplacental alkaline phosphatase)', 'EC 3.1.3.1 (Alkaline Phosphatase)']",IM,,"['Alkaline Phosphatase/genetics/*metabolism', 'Glycosylphosphatidylinositols/genetics/*metabolism', 'HeLa Cells/metabolism', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/metabolism', 'Microsomes/metabolism', 'Mutagenesis/genetics/physiology', 'Pregnancy Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Engineering/methods', 'Protein Precursors/*metabolism', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/*physiology', 'Protein Sorting Signals/*physiology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/metabolism']",2001/12/18 10:00,2002/03/14 10:01,['2001/12/18 10:00'],"['2001/12/18 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/14 10:01 [medline]', '2001/12/18 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2001;84(1):68-83. doi: 10.1002/jcb.1267.,,"['10.1002/jcb.1267 [pii]', '10.1002/jcb.1267 [doi]']",,,,"['Copyright 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,"['CA81550/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK38181/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,

Recently, we isolated a major component (6% of the total ethanolic extract) known as baicalin from PC-SPES by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). METHODS: Baicalin was evaluated for its ability to inhibit clonal growth, and to induce cell cycle arrest of various cancer types (PC-3, DU145, LNCaP prostate cancer cell lines, MCF-7 breast cancer cell line, HL-60 myeloblastic leukemia cell line, and NB4 promyelocytic leukemia cell line). The ability of baicalin to induce apoptosis of cancer cells was examined by both staining with Annexin V and detection of cleavage of Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)(3). Western blot analysis examined the effect of baicalin on levels of p21(waf1) and p27(kip1) in those cells. Futhermore, induction of differentiation in HL-60 cells was measured by expression of CD11b. RESULTS: Baicalin inhibited the clonal proliferation of LNCaP and PC3 prostate cancer cell lines, and the HL-60 and NB4 myeloblastic/promyelocytic leukemia cell lines with a 50% inhibition (ED(50)) that ranged between 6.4 x 10(-6) to 12 x 10(-6) mol/L. Cell cycle analysis showed that baicalin (2 x 10(-5) mol/L, 4 days) caused a G(0)/G(1) and G(2)/M accumulation of LNCaP and HL-60 cells, respectively. Concomitantly, differentiation and apoptosis were induced in HL-60 cells, as measured by expression of CD11b antigen, staining with annexin V, and detection of cleavage of PARP. Moreover, baicalin enhanced the expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, p27(kip1) in LNCaP and HL-60 cells. CONCLUSIONS: Baicalin inhibited the proliferation of cancer cells via apoptosis and cell cycle arrest, in which p27(kip1) may play a role. Baicalin may be a novel, adjunctive therapy for selected malignancies including prostate cancer.","['Ikezoe, T', 'Chen, S S', 'Heber, D', 'Taguchi, H', 'Koeffler, H P']","['Ikezoe T', 'Chen SS', 'Heber D', 'Taguchi H', 'Koeffler HP']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, UCLA School of Medicine, Los Angeles, California 90048, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Prostate,The Prostate,8101368,"['0 (Annexin A5)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Drugs, Chinese Herbal)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Macrophage-1 Antigen)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)', '347Q89U4M5 (baicalin)']",IM,,"['Annexin A5/analysis', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Breast Neoplasms/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27', 'Cyclins/biosynthesis', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Drugs, Chinese Herbal/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Flavonoids/*pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HL-60 Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Macrophage-1 Antigen/analysis', 'Male', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/biosynthesis']",2001/12/18 10:00,2002/01/10 10:01,['2001/12/18 10:00'],"['2001/12/18 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/10 10:01 [medline]', '2001/12/18 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Prostate. 2001 Dec 1;49(4):285-92. doi: 10.1002/pros.10024.,,"['10.1002/pros.10024 [pii]', '10.1002/pros.10024 [doi]']",,,,"['Copyright 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,

Four equal groups of Balb/c young male mice (5 animals in each group; mean+/-SD body weight 9.64+/-0.85 g, in their rapid growth phase) were subjected to the following drug treatment: One group was given MTX (3.5 mg/kg body weight) intraperitoneally on every 2nd day, another received folinic acid (7.0 mg/kg body weight) intraperitoneally every 2nd day. The third group was given both of these drugs (MTX on every 2nd day and folinic acid 8 h post-MTX injection). The fourth group was injected with physiological saline every other day to serve as a control group. Total body weight, food and water consumption by animals in each group were monitored every second day for a period of 3 weeks. After this period mice were sacrificed and liver, spleen and kidneys were excised, weighed and analyzed for MTX and dihydrofolate reductase activity. A small segment of the proximal part of small intestine and small pieces of liver and kidney were also removed to study morphological changes. Compared to the groups, which received folinic acid alone, folinic acid plus MTX or physiological saline, mean increase in body weight (6.8+/-0.8 g) of mice over a period of 3 weeks was minimal in the group receiving MTX alone (one-way ANOVA p=0.0001). The mean weights of liver and kidney in this group receiving MTX alone were also found to be significantly less than the mean weights of these organs in the 3 groups (p<0.001). The negative effect on growth of animals appears not only due to malabsorption but inhibition of pathway of de novo DNA synthesis may also be involved. This is supported by loss of villous pattern in small intestine of mice treated with MTX alone and increased accumulation of free MTX and decreased dihydrofolate reductase in the liver of the group receiving MTX alone as compared with the group receiving MTX plus folinic acid. The data indicate that the administration of folinic acid protects mice against suppression of growth by MTX. On the basis of these observations it can be deduced that patients suffering from juvenile rheumatoid arthritis or acute lymphoblastic leukaemia receiving MTX over a long period of time might be at a risk of experiencing short-term suppression of growth, however they could benefit from supplementation with folinic acid.","['Iqbal, M P', 'Sultana, F', 'Mehboobali, N', 'Pervez, S']","['Iqbal MP', 'Sultana F', 'Mehboobali N', 'Pervez S']","['Department of Biological & Biomedical Sciences, The Aga Khan University, PO Box 3500, Stadium Road, Karachi, Pakistan. perwaiz.iqbal@aku.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Biopharm Drug Dispos,Biopharmaceutics & drug disposition,7911226,"['0 (Antidotes)', '0 (Folic Acid Antagonists)', 'EC 1.5.1.3 (Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase)', 'Q573I9DVLP (Leucovorin)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antidotes/*pharmacology', 'Body Weight/drug effects', 'Eating/drug effects', 'Folic Acid Antagonists/*toxicity', 'Growth Disorders/*chemically induced/pathology/*prevention & control', 'Intestine, Small/pathology', 'Kidney/metabolism/pathology', 'Leucovorin/*pharmacology', 'Liver/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/*antagonists & inhibitors/*toxicity', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase/metabolism']",2001/12/18 10:00,2002/01/29 10:01,['2001/12/18 10:00'],"['2001/12/18 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/29 10:01 [medline]', '2001/12/18 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biopharm Drug Dispos. 2001 May;22(4):169-78. doi: 10.1002/bdd.271.,,"['10.1002/bdd.271 [pii]', '10.1002/bdd.271 [doi]']",,,,"['Copyright 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']",,,,,,,,

We consequently addressed here the question whether IL-8 produced by acute myeloid leukemia (AML) blasts might have a comparable function. PROCEDURE: In 21 pediatric patients with AML the role of AML derived IL-8 in angiogenesis related processes were investigated. Therefore, IL-8 protein and mRNA expression were measured and endothelial cell (EC) migration and proliferation assays were performed. In addition, bFGF and VEGF mRNA expression were measured by RT-PCR. RESULTS: In the supernatant of the AML blasts, IL-8 protein was present in a varying amount (median 0.86 microg/L, range: 0.1-320 microg/L) and confirmed by RT-PCR. Normal bone marrow mononuclear cells secreted a significant lower amount of IL-8 protein (median: 0.053 microg/L, range: 0.023-0.055 microg/L, P = 0.007). Seven of the 17 tested AML supernatants induced a varying low amount of EC proliferation compared to control media, which was not inhibited by anti-IL-8 antibodies. In contrast, in the EC migration assay, 15 out of the 17 AML supernatants tested, showed an increased EC migration (median fold increase: 1.97, range: 0.66-6.36, P = 0.002) compared to control medium. The increase in EC migration could partially be blocked by anti-IL-8 in 59% of the cases (18% decrease, range 0-62%, P = 0.003). Other contributors for the increase in EC migration were also determined. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) transcripts by RT-PCR were demonstrated in six out of the nine tested AML cases, while no transcripts for basic fibroblast growth factor (VEGF) could be shown. CONCLUSIONS: Neutralizing anti IL-8 antibodies inhibit EC migration when stimulated with AML supernatant. This suggests a facilitating role for AML-derived IL-8 in an important step in angiogenesis.","['de Bont, E S', 'Vellenga, E', 'Molema, G', 'van Wering, E', 'de Leij, L F', 'Kamps, W A']","['de Bont ES', 'Vellenga E', 'Molema G', 'van Wering E', 'de Leij LF', 'Kamps WA']","[""Division of Paediatric Oncology, Department of Paediatrics, Beatrix Children's Hospital, Groningen, The Netherlands. e.de.bont@bbk.azg.nl""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Med Pediatr Oncol,Medical and pediatric oncology,7506654,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Endothelial Growth Factors)', '0 (Interleukin-8)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-8A)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors)', '103107-01-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 2)']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*metabolism', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Movement', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA Primers', 'Endothelial Growth Factors/metabolism', 'Endothelium, Vascular/*physiology', 'Female', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 2/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Interleukin-8/*biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism', 'Lymphokines/metabolism', 'Male', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic', 'RNA, Messenger/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin-8A/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors']",2001/12/18 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/12/18 10:00'],"['2001/12/18 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/12/18 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Med Pediatr Oncol. 2001 Dec;37(6):511-7. doi: 10.1002/mpo.1244.,,"['10.1002/mpo.1244 [pii]', '10.1002/mpo.1244 [doi]']",,,,"['Copyright 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,

We evaluated the efficacy of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (allo-BMT) for children with this type of leukemia. PROCEDURE: The chemotherapy regimens consisted of an induction phase and very intensive consolidation followed by a reinduction phase and late intensification treatment. The selection of treatment modalities such as chemotherapy, allo-BMT, or autologous transplantation was made by each institute. The principal endpoint was the outcome of children with Ph(+) ALL according to the treatment options. RESULTS: Thirty-two patients (4.3%) were diagnosed as Ph(+) ALL out of the 741 cases of ALL consecutively enrolled in two protocols of the Tokyo Children's Cancer Study Group (TCCSG) from 1989 to 1994. Thirty patients (93.8%) were induced into complete remission (CR). Of these 30 patients, eight children electively received allo-BMT in the first CR. Six of these patients are in continuous remission at a median follow-up of 58 (range 48-105) months after the diagnosis. One patient died following recurrence and another patient died of graft vs. host disease. Three patients treated with autologous BMT or peripheral blood stem cell transplantation in the first CR experienced a subsequent relapse. In the remaining 19 patients, 13 patients were treated with very high-risk chemotherapy alone and all relapsed within 28 months. One patient was excluded from the analysis because he was treated with standard-risk chemotherapy until relapse. The other five patients were also excluded from the analysis because Philadelphia chromosome was not detected until they relapsed. None of the relapsed patients survived in spite of treatment including allo-BMT. In multivariate analysis, only allo-BMT remained as an independent factor for good prognosis. CONCLUSIONS: The only way to cure children with Ph(+) ALL was allo-BMT in this study and its outcome seemed promising.","['Mori, T', 'Manabe, A', 'Tsuchida, M', 'Hanada, R', 'Yabe, H', 'Ohara, A', 'Saito, T', 'Nakazawa, S']","['Mori T', 'Manabe A', 'Tsuchida M', 'Hanada R', 'Yabe H', 'Ohara A', 'Saito T', 'Nakazawa S']","['Department of Pediatrics, Social Insurance Saitama Chuo Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Med Pediatr Oncol,Medical and pediatric oncology,7506654,,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/pathology/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Risk Factors', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",2001/12/18 10:00,2002/01/10 10:01,['2001/12/18 10:00'],"['2001/12/18 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/10 10:01 [medline]', '2001/12/18 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Med Pediatr Oncol. 2001 Nov;37(5):426-31. doi: 10.1002/mpo.1225.,,"['10.1002/mpo.1225 [pii]', '10.1002/mpo.1225 [doi]']",,,,"['Copyright 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,

A multi-institutional study.,419-25,"BACKGROUND: Genetic aberrations provide prognostic information in childhood ALL. The proportion of patients with detectable aberrations can be increased by combining G-banding with comparative genomic hybridization (CGH). PROCEDURE: We studied 79 children with ALL by CGH and G-banding, and explored the relationship of these findings to clinical features and outcome. RESULTS: CGH revealed DNA copy number changes in 57 patients (72%), 9 of whom had normal karyotype by G-banding. Gains were more frequent than losses, and changes of whole chromosomes more frequent than partial aberrations. Two frequent partial losses were found; at 9p and 12p. The 9 patients with loss at 12p were studied for the deletion of TEL (ETV6) gene and the fusion of TEL and AML1 genes by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). Eight out of the 9 children with loss at 12p harbored the TEL-AML1 translocation and all 9 had the deletion of a nontranslocated TEL allele. All 9 had precursor-B phenotype and L1 morphology, and 8/9 had WBC below 50 x 10(9)/liter. All children were treated according to Nordic ALL protocols, had a good response to treatment based on day 15 bone marrow morphology, and 7 out of the 9 survived in continuous complete remission (median follow-up 74 months). CONCLUSIONS: CGH is a valuable tool in screening for genetic aberrations in childhood ALL. DNA copy number losses detected at 12p associate with TEL-AML1 fusion as well as with favorable prognostic features.","['Kanerva, J', 'Niini, T', 'Vettenranta, K', 'Riikonen, P', 'Makipernaa, A', 'Karhu, R', 'Knuutila, S', 'Saarinen-Pihkala, U M']","['Kanerva J', 'Niini T', 'Vettenranta K', 'Riikonen P', 'Makipernaa A', 'Karhu R', 'Knuutila S', 'Saarinen-Pihkala UM']","['Hospital for Children and Adolescents, Helsinki University Central Hospital, Finland. jukka.kanerva@hus.fi']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Med Pediatr Oncol,Medical and pediatric oncology,7506654,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (TEL-AML1 fusion protein)']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 12/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9/*genetics', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Karyotyping', 'Loss of Heterozygosity', 'Male', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Phenotype', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Analysis']",2001/12/18 10:00,2002/01/10 10:01,['2001/12/18 10:00'],"['2001/12/18 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/10 10:01 [medline]', '2001/12/18 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Med Pediatr Oncol. 2001 Nov;37(5):419-25. doi: 10.1002/mpo.1224.,,"['10.1002/mpo.1224 [pii]', '10.1002/mpo.1224 [doi]']",,,,"['Copyright 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,

COX-2 expression, however, has not been extensively studied in leukemia. Human T cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I) is the etiologic agent of adult T cell leukemia, an aggressive form of human T cell malignancy. We studied COX-2 mRNA expression in various human T-cell lines. Northern blot analysis revealed that COX-2 mRNA steady-state levels were high in 4 of 7 T-cell lines infected with HTLV-I. COX-2 mRNA, however, was not expressed in any of 3 HTLV-I-negative T-cell lines. We also confirmed COX-2 expression in 6 of 7 HTLV-I-positive T-cell lines by reverse transcription-PCR. HTLV-I Tax is known to increase the expression of cellular genes and thus we assayed Tax for its ability to increase transcription from the COX-2 promoter. Although Tax increased transcription of the COX-2 promoter in a T-cell line, Tax expression did not induce COX-2 mRNA expression, indicating that Tax alone is not sufficient for significant accumulation of COX-2 mRNA, which probably requires an additional viral protein. To evaluate the potential role of COX-2 in T cells, the HTLV-I-infected T-cell lines were treated with NS398, a selective COX-2 inhibitor. NS398 treatment inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis of HTLV-I-infected T-cell lines and downregulated Bcl-2 and Bcl-x(L) mRNA expression, followed by chromosomal DNA fragmentation. Our data suggest that COX-2 is expressed selectively in T-cell lines infected with HTLV-I and that this gene may play a role in cell survival.","['Mori, N', 'Inoue, H', 'Yoshida, T', 'Tanabe, T', 'Yamamoto, N']","['Mori N', 'Inoue H', 'Yoshida T', 'Tanabe T', 'Yamamoto N']","['Department of Preventive Medicine and AIDS Research, Institute of Tropical Medicine, Nagasaki University, Nagasaki, Japan. n-mori@net.nagasaki-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Nitrobenzenes)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '123653-11-2 (N-(2-cyclohexyloxy-4-nitrophenyl)methanesulfonamide)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (Cyclooxygenase 2)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (PTGS2 protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthases)', 'K7Q1JQR04M (Dinoprostone)']",IM,,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cyclooxygenase 2', 'Dinoprostone/biosynthesis', 'Gene Products, tax/physiology', 'Genes, bcl-2', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/*genetics/physiology', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Nitrobenzenes/pharmacology', 'Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthases/*genetics/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sulfonamides/pharmacology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*enzymology/virology', 'bcl-X Protein']",2001/12/18 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/12/18 10:00'],"['2001/12/18 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/12/18 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2001 Dec 15;94(6):813-9. doi: 10.1002/ijc.1544.,,"['10.1002/ijc.1544 [pii]', '10.1002/ijc.1544 [doi]']",,,,"['Copyright 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,

We also found significantly increased risks of myeloid leukaemia (probably due to radiotherapy) and of cancer of the corpus uteri (which may be due to hormonal factors).","['Evans, H S', 'Lewis, C M', 'Robinson, D', 'Bell, C M', 'Moller, H', 'Hodgson, S V']","['Evans HS', 'Lewis CM', 'Robinson D', 'Bell CM', 'Moller H', 'Hodgson SV']","[""Thames Cancer Registry, Division of Medicine, Guy's, King's and St. Thomas' School of Medicine, London, United Kingdom. helen.evans@kcl.ac.uk""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,,IM,,"['Breast Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Female', 'Genes, BRCA1', 'Genes, BRCA2', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Mutation', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Risk']",2001/12/18 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/12/18 10:00'],"['2001/12/18 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/12/18 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2001 Dec 1;94(5):758-9. doi: 10.1002/ijc.1534.,,"['10.1002/ijc.1534 [pii]', '10.1002/ijc.1534 [doi]']",,,,"['Copyright 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,

The MAb showed a strong positivity within tumor vessels in glioblastoma and breast carcinoma samples, and the distribution was consistent with antigen association with vascular endothelial cells. A purification procedure of the antigen was developed starting from DG-RSV-LT-2, an immortalized human endothelial cell line. Molecular mass, N-terminal sequence of the purified antigen and localization on endothelial cell surface allowed identification with human endoglin (CD105). Flow cytometry analysis of a group of normal and transformed cell lines showed that, besides endothelial cells and myelocytic leukemia cells already shown to be positive, fetal fibroblasts, choriocarcinoma, fibrosarcoma and rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines were also positive for this antigen. Immunohistochemic analysis of several normal adult tissues revealed a more extensive presence of the antigen in normal vessels compared to that described with previously characterized antibodies. In fact, even though the staining was weaker than in tumor tissues, all tissues were found to be positive, at least in microvessels, except for normal breast. Moreover, in some tissues (glands and reproductive tract) a positive reaction was observed in the stroma. Since endoglin has been proposed as a possible target for antiangiogenic therapy in tumor patients and our data demonstrate a sizable amount of endoglin in normal vessels and stroma, its clinical use should be carefully reevaluated.","['Balza, E', 'Castellani, P', 'Zijlstra, A', 'Neri, D', 'Zardi, L', 'Siri, A']","['Balza E', 'Castellani P', 'Zijlstra A', 'Neri D', 'Zardi L', 'Siri A']","['Laboratory of Cell Biology, Istituto Nazionale per la Ricerca sul Cancro, Genoa, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (ENG protein, human)', '0 (Endoglin)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1)']",IM,['Int J Cancer. 2002 May 10;99(2):310-1; author reply 312.

The present study was performed to examine whether bestatin can also induce apoptosis in solid tumor cell lines. Bestatin alone exhibited neither direct growth inhibition nor induction of apoptosis in the tumor cell lines examined. However, it significantly augmented the growth-inhibitory effect and induction of apoptosis by agonistic anti-Fas antibody (CH11). The augmentation by bestatin was also observed with other death ligands including tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) in EBC-1 cells, a cell line sensitive to these death ligands. However, the HeLa S3 cell line, which is insensitive to TNF-alpha, showed no growth inhibition even by combination treatment. Bestatin methyl ester, a more cell-permeable derivative of bestatin with similar inhibitory activity to cytosolic neutral aminopeptidase, potentiated cell growth inhibition of CH11 more efficiently than bestatin. Other cytosolic neutral aminopeptidase inhibitors such as actinonin and puromycin also augmented cell growth suppression by CH11, while an enantiomer of bestatin lacking aminopeptidase inhibitory action did not increase the growth-inhibitory effects of CH11. The combination of 10 microg/ml of bestatin with CH11 promoted processing of caspase 3 to the active form p17 and efflux of mitochondrial cytochrome c into the cytosol more quickly and more intensely than CH11 alone. Inhibition of aminopeptidase was not involved in dATP- and cytochrome c-dependent caspase 3-activation in a cell-free system. Bestatin significantly augmented activation of caspase 8, which is upstream of cytochrome c efflux in the apoptosis cascade. These results suggested that intracellular neutral aminopeptidase might play an important role in Fas- or TNF-alpha-induced solid tumor cell apoptosis.","['Sekine, K', 'Fujii, H', 'Abe, F', 'Nishikawa, K']","['Sekine K', 'Fujii H', 'Abe F', 'Nishikawa K']","['Evaluation Group, Drug Research Department, R. & D.

At concentrations of 10(-9) to 10(-10) M, this agent strongly inhibited the growth of human tumor cell lines. In sensitive human leukemia K562 cells, gnidimacrin is a PKC activator that arrests the cell cycle in the G(1) phase by inhibiting cdk2 activity. A 4 hr exposure of K562 cells to gnidimacrin induced the CDK inhibitor p21(WAF1/Cip1), but this effect was transient and did not correlate temporally with the onset of G(1) arrest. Expression of cdc25A, a phosphatase that activates cdk2, was reduced during 24-hr exposure to gnidimacrin. Moreover, the suppression corresponded in a concentration- and time-dependent manner to both the inhibition of cdk2 activity and the mobility shift observed when cdk2 was electrophoresed on SDS-PAGE, indicating that the phosphorylation state of cdk2 must change. Cyclin E, the other regulator of cdk2 activity, was not influenced by gnidimacrin. These results suggest that gnidimacrin exerts antitumor activity through suppression of cdc25A and inhibition of cdk2 activity.","['Yoshida, M', 'Feng, W', 'Nishio, K', 'Takahashi, M', 'Heike, Y', 'Saijo, N', 'Wakasugi, H', 'Ikekawa, T']","['Yoshida M', 'Feng W', 'Nishio K', 'Takahashi M', 'Heike Y', 'Saijo N', 'Wakasugi H', 'Ikekawa T']","['Pharmacology Division, National Cancer Center Research Institute, Tokyo, Japan. myoshida@gan2.res.ncc.go.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cdkn1a protein, mouse)', '0 (Coloring Agents)', '0 (Cyclin E)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Diterpenes)', '0 (Tetrazolium Salts)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '60796-70-5 (gnidimacrin)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (histone H1 kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDC2-CDC28 Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cdk2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (CDC25A protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Cdc25a protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (cdc25 Phosphatases)', 'EUY85H477I (thiazolyl blue)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Western', '*CDC2-CDC28 Kinases', 'Cell Cycle', 'Coloring Agents/pharmacology', 'Cyclin E/metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Cyclins/metabolism', 'Diterpenes/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Down-Regulation', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Mice', 'Models, Biological', 'Models, Chemical', 'Phosphorylation', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Protein Kinase C/*metabolism', 'Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Tetrazolium Salts/pharmacology', 'Thiazoles/pharmacology', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'cdc25 Phosphatases/metabolism']",2001/12/18 10:00,2002/01/10 10:01,['2001/12/18 10:00'],"['2001/12/18 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/10 10:01 [medline]', '2001/12/18 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2001 Nov 1;94(3):348-52. doi: 10.1002/ijc.1476.,,"['10.1002/ijc.1476 [pii]', '10.1002/ijc.1476 [doi]']",,,,"['Copyright 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,

Further, we provide evidence thatLAIR-1 engagement inhibits granulocyte-monocyte colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)-induced proliferation of AML blasts. Indeed, leukemia cells stimulated with GM-CSF were blocked in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle and underwent apoptosis within 4 days after the engagement of LAIR-1. Remarkably, LAIR-1 was functional also in AML blasts which do not express CD33, mainly M4 and M5. Importantly, the LAIR-1 ligation led to a strong inhibition of both GM-CSF receptor-mediated intracellular calcium increases, phosphorylation and activation of Akt1/protein kinase B alpha, a substrate of the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase. This last inhibitory effect was prevented by a synthetic peptide spanning the ITIM portion of LAIR-1, suggesting the involvement of SHP-1 phosphatase in LAIR-1-mediated inhibitory signal. Altogether, these findings indicate that the engagement of LAIR-1 can down-regulate GM-CSF-mediated survival and proliferation of AML blasts, suggesting an additional therapeutic approach to the treatment of AML patients.","['Zocchi, M R', 'Pellegatta, F', 'Pierri, I', 'Gobbi, M', 'Poggi, A']","['Zocchi MR', 'Pellegatta F', 'Pierri I', 'Gobbi M', 'Poggi A']","['Laboratory of Tumor Immunology, Department of Internal Medicine, Scientific Institute San Raffaele, Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (CD33 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3)', '0 (leukocyte-associated immunoglobulin-like receptor 1)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (AKT1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",IM,,"['Antigens, CD/physiology', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/physiology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/enzymology/*pathology', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*metabolism', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/physiology', 'Receptors, Immunologic/analysis/*physiology', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3']",2001/12/18 10:00,2002/01/25 10:01,['2001/12/18 10:00'],"['2001/12/18 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/25 10:01 [medline]', '2001/12/18 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 2001 Dec;31(12):3667-75. doi: 10.1002/1521-4141(200112)31:12<3667::aid-immu3667>3.0.co;2-g.,,"['10.1002/1521-4141(200112)31:12<3667::AID-IMMU3667>3.0.CO;2-G [pii]', '10.1002/1521-4141(200112)31:12<3667::aid-immu3667>3.0.co;2-g [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast to the related Ikaros factors, mammalian Aiolos has not been reported to generate splice variants. In addition, although human leukemic lymphoblasts express non-DNA-binding Ikaros isoforms with potential dominant negative effect on other interacting factors,the role of Aiolos in human lymphoid disorders has remained obscure. To address the question, why Aiolos should delineate from Ikaros in such a marked way, we have here analyzed whether also human Aiolos could generate alternate isoforms. According to the results obtained, both normal and neoplastic B lineage cells were found to express at least five novel Aiolos variants. Also structurally dominant negative variants with less than three DNA-binding domains were identified. In conclusion, given the multiplicity of also human Aiolos isoforms and thereby the evidently more intricate contribution of Aiolos to the chromatin remodeling machinery, it is suggested, that not only Ikaros, but also Aiolos could participate in a more versatile manner in the regulation of B lymphocyte function.","['Liippo, J', 'Nera, K P', 'Veistinen, E', 'Lahdesmaki, A', 'Postila, V', 'Kimby, E', 'Riikonen, P', 'Hammarstrom, L', 'Pelkonen, J', 'Lassila, O']","['Liippo J', 'Nera KP', 'Veistinen E', 'Lahdesmaki A', 'Postila V', 'Kimby E', 'Riikonen P', 'Hammarstrom L', 'Pelkonen J', 'Lassila O']","['Turku Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences and Department of Medical Microbiology, University of Turku, Turku, Finland. jussi.liippo@utu.fi']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (IKZF1 protein, human)', '0 (IKZF3 protein, human)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '148971-36-2 (Ikaros Transcription Factor)']",IM,,"['Alternative Splicing', 'B-Lymphocytes/*physiology', '*DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Exons', 'Humans', 'Ikaros Transcription Factor', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Trans-Activators/*genetics/physiology', 'Transcription Factors/physiology']",2001/12/18 10:00,2002/01/25 10:01,['2001/12/18 10:00'],"['2001/12/18 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/25 10:01 [medline]', '2001/12/18 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 2001 Dec;31(12):3469-74. doi: 10.1002/1521-4141(200112)31:12<3469::aid-immu3469>3.0.co;2-g.,,"['10.1002/1521-4141(200112)31:12<3469::AID-IMMU3469>3.0.CO;2-G [pii]', '10.1002/1521-4141(200112)31:12<3469::aid-immu3469>3.0.co;2-g [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Its pathogenesis is poorly understood. METHODS: The authors present one case of childhood lymphoma and two cases of childhood leukemia associated with LA, and they review the available literature. Plasma concentrations of insulin-like growth factors (IGFs), IGF binding proteins (IGFBPs), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha were retrospectively measured to elucidate the pathogenesis of LA. RESULTS: Lactic acidosis has been reported to date in 28 cases of lymphoma and 25 cases of leukemia, including the authors' cases. Ongoing rapid cellular proliferation was indicated in all leukemia cases. The liver was involved in 43 of the 53 cases, and hypoglycemia was present in 20. The acidosis improved only if the disease responded to chemotherapy. Remission was achieved in only five of the reported cases. In the authors' three cases, LA was associated with altered concentrations of IGFs, IGFBPs, and TNF-alpha, although causality was not established. CONCLUSIONS: Lactic acidosis in association with hematologic malignancies carries an extremely poor prognosis. Because cancer cells have a high rate of glycolysis and produce a large quantity of lactate, this condition may result from an imbalance between lactate production and hepatic lactate utilization. The authors speculate that the IGF system is involved in the pathophysiology of LA in these patients. Only chemotherapy so far has been effective in correcting the acute acidosis in a few patients; however, it has not necessarily improved ultimate outcome.","['Sillos, E M', 'Shenep, J L', 'Burghen, G A', 'Pui, C H', 'Behm, F G', 'Sandlund, J T']","['Sillos EM', 'Shenep JL', 'Burghen GA', 'Pui CH', 'Behm FG', 'Sandlund JT']","[""Division of Critical Care, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, 332 North Lauderdale Street, Memphis, TN 38105-2794, USA. elaine.sillos@stjude.org""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,['0 (Somatomedins)'],IM,,"['Acidosis, Lactic/*etiology/pathology', 'Adolescent', 'Child', 'Female', 'Glycolysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*complications', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*complications', 'Lymphoma/*complications', 'Male', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Somatomedins/pharmacology']",2001/12/18 10:00,2002/01/10 10:01,['2001/12/18 10:00'],"['2001/12/18 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/10 10:01 [medline]', '2001/12/18 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer. 2001 Nov 1;92(9):2237-46. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(20011101)92:9<2237::aid-cncr1569>3.0.co;2-9.,,"['10.1002/1097-0142(20011101)92:9<2237::AID-CNCR1569>3.0.CO;2-9 [pii]', '10.1002/1097-0142(20011101)92:9<2237::aid-cncr1569>3.0.co;2-9 [doi]']",,,,['Copyright 2001 American Cancer Society.'],,['P30 CA-21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,

Much of this progress remains unaccounted for in traditional estimates of long-term survival rates, which essentially reflect the survival experience of patients who were diagnosed many years ago. METHODS: The authors applied a new method of survival analysis, called period analysis, to provide up-to-date estimates of long-term survival rates. The analysis is based on data from the nationwide German Childhood Cancer Registry and includes 8059 children who were diagnosed with leukemia between 1981 and 1998. The most up-to-date 5-year, 10-year, and 15-year survival estimates were obtained by period analysis and were compared with to the most up-to-date survival estimates from traditional methods of survival analysis. RESULTS: Period estimates (95% confidence intervals) of 5-year, 10-year, and 15-year survival rates achieved by 1998 were 81% (79-83%), 77% (74-79%), and 73% (70-76%), respectively, for all patients with leukemia combined; 86% (84-88%), 81% (79-84%), and 77% (74-81%), respectively, for patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia; and 59% (53-65%), 59% (53-65%), and 57% (49-64%), respectively, for patients with acute nonlymphocytic leukemia. Substantially lower estimates would have been obtained with traditional methods of survival analysis. CONCLUSIONS: These results from one of the world's largest childhood cancer registries reveal that cure rates of childhood leukemia achieved by the end of the second millennium are higher than suggested by previous estimates based on traditional methods of survival analysis.","['Brenner, H', 'Kaatsch, P', 'Burkhardt-Hammer, T', 'Harms, D O', 'Schrappe, M', 'Michaelis, J']","['Brenner H', 'Kaatsch P', 'Burkhardt-Hammer T', 'Harms DO', 'Schrappe M', 'Michaelis J']","['Department of Epidemiology, German Centre for Research on Ageing, Bergheimer Strasse 20, D-69115 Heidelberg, Germany. brenner@dzfa.uni-heidelberg.de']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Germany/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/*mortality/therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/epidemiology', 'Registries', 'Survival Analysis']",2001/12/18 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/12/18 10:00'],"['2001/12/18 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/12/18 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer. 2001 Oct 1;92(7):1977-83. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(20011001)92:7<1977::aid-cncr1717>3.0.co;2-w.,,"['10.1002/1097-0142(20011001)92:7<1977::AID-CNCR1717>3.0.CO;2-W [pii]', '10.1002/1097-0142(20011001)92:7<1977::aid-cncr1717>3.0.co;2-w [doi]']",,,,['Copyright 2001 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,,

METHODS: The authors retrospectively reviewed a cohort of 497 patients with NHL who were treated at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital between 1970 and 1997. RESULTS: A second malignancy developed in 16 patients (9 patients with solid tumors and 7 patients with secondary acute myeloid leukemia [AML]). This number was 10.8-fold (95% confidence interval, 6.1-16.9) higher than the 1.48 patients projected for the general population by SEER Cancer Statistics. The estimated cumulative incidence rate of second malignancy was 2.1% +/- 0.7% at 10 years after diagnosis of NHL and increased to 4.8% +/- 1.3% at 20 years after diagnosis. The cumulative incidence rate of second malignancy was least among patients with small noncleaved cell lymphoma (0.5% +/- 0.5% at 20 years), higher among patients with large cell lymphoma (5.8% +/- 3.3% at 20 years), and highest among patients with lymphoblastic lymphoma (10.9% +/- 3.6% at 20 years; P = 0.002 for overall comparison). Exposure to epipodophyllotoxins was a risk factor for the development of secondary AML (P < 0.001). The cumulative incidence rate of death due to other causes was significantly less for patients who were treated after June 1978 (19.9% +/- 2.2% at 10 years) compared with patients who were treated earlier (55.6% +/- 4.2% at 10 years; P < 0.001), whereas the risk of second malignancy was similar for these two eras. CONCLUSIONS: Survivors of childhood NHL, especially those with lymphoblastic histology, are at a greater risk of developing a second malignancy compared with the general population. The incidence rate of second malignancy has remained unchanged despite a recent decline in the risk of death related to primary NHL or earlier treatment complications.","['Leung, W', 'Sandlund, J T', 'Hudson, M M', 'Zhou, Y', 'Hancock, M L', 'Zhu, Y', 'Ribeiro, R C', 'Rubnitz, J E', 'Kun, L E', 'Razzouk, B', 'Evans, W E', 'Pui, C H']","['Leung W', 'Sandlund JT', 'Hudson MM', 'Zhou Y', 'Hancock ML', 'Zhu Y', 'Ribeiro RC', 'Rubnitz JE', 'Kun LE', 'Razzouk B', 'Evans WE', 'Pui CH']","[""St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, 332 N.

METHODS: In this report, by using a similar approach, the authors demonstrate further that the suppression of PDPK F(A) enhances even more dramatically the chemosensitivity of clinically used anticancer drugs in various types of human acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells. RESULTS: Compared with parental and control transfected cells, transduced ALL cells (both Jurkat and CCRF-CEM cells) with low levels of PDPK F(A) displayed an enhanced sensitivity to vincristine, vinblastine, paclitaxel, methotrexate, doxorubicin, and daunorubicin. Estimation of the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) index further revealed that the transduced cells displayed up to > 3000-fold drug sensitivity, and there was a correlation between suppressed levels of PDPK F(A) and drug sensitivity. A mechanistic study further revealed that the enhanced chemosensitivity in transduced ALL cells was due mainly to the potentiation of apoptotic induction. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, the results demonstrate that the suppression of overexpressed PDPK F(A) greatly enhances the chemosensitivity of various clinical anticancer drugs in both types of human ALL cells, providing initial evidence for an important role of this PDPK in controlling multidrug resistance of ALL.","['Hsu, C P', 'Yang, C C', 'Hsueh, S F', 'Peng, C C', 'Fu, H H', 'Yang, S D']","['Hsu CP', 'Yang CC', 'Hsueh SF', 'Peng CC', 'Fu HH', 'Yang SD']","['Department of Life Science, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, Republic of China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'EC 2.7.11.- (Proline-Directed Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*enzymology', 'Proline-Directed Protein Kinases', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/12/18 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/12/18 10:00'],"['2001/12/18 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/12/18 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer. 2001 Oct 1;92(7):1753-8. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(20011001)92:7<1753::aid-cncr1690>3.0.co;2-v.,,"['10.1002/1097-0142(20011001)92:7<1753::AID-CNCR1690>3.0.CO;2-V [pii]', '10.1002/1097-0142(20011001)92:7<1753::aid-cncr1690>3.0.co;2-v [doi]']",,,,['Copyright 2001 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,,

METHODS: T-cell receptor (TCR) gene analysis was performed using DNA extracted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 74 patients, and the results were correlated with a variety of other diagnostic parameters and patient outcomes. RESULTS: Two groups were identified: 66 patients with clonal TCR gene rearrangement (clonal patients) detected with Southern blot analysis and/or polymerase chain reaction/single-strand conformational polymorphism analysis and 8 patients with no clonal rearrangement detected (nonclonal patients) using either technique. Clonal patients were compared with nonclonal patients. The following median blood parameters were significantly greater in the clonal group: total white cell count (13.7 10(9)/L vs. 9.6 10(9)/L), lymphocyte count (4.9 10(9)/L vs. 2.2 10(9)/L), absolute Sezary count (3.22 10(9)/L vs. 0.99 10(9)/L), CD4 count (3.17 10(9)/L vs. 1.36 10(9)/L), and CD4:CD8 ratio (15.86 vs. 3.21). An expanded population of T-cells of a specific TCR variable beta subset was detected in 7 of 36 clonal patients and in 1 of 4 nonclonal patients. Cytogenetic analysis of peripheral blood from 1 nonclonal patient and 6 clonal patients was normal. The median survival from the time of diagnosis was 45 months in the clonal group, and 40 of 49 deaths were cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL)-related, whereas 3 deaths in the nonclonal group were unrelated to CTCL (P < 0.01; log-rank test). Multivariate proportional hazards analysis showed that the absolute Sezary count and lymph node status were independent prognostic variables (P = 0.016 and P = 0.036, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: TCR gene analysis defines a distinct clinicopathologic group of patients with SS. Clonal patients have a poor prognosis and are likely to die from leukemia/lymphoma, whereas nonclonal patients may have a reactive, inflammatory T-cell disorder. The authors suggest that the definitive diagnostic criteria for patients with SS should include the presence of a clonal TCR gene rearrangement.","['Fraser-Andrews, E A', 'Russell-Jones, R', 'Woolford, A J', 'Wolstencroft, R A', 'Dean, A J', 'Whittaker, S J']","['Fraser-Andrews EA', 'Russell-Jones R', 'Woolford AJ', 'Wolstencroft RA', 'Dean AJ', 'Whittaker SJ']","[""Skin Tumor Unit, St. John's Institute of Dermatology, St. Thomas' Hospital, Lambeth Palace Road, London, SE1 7EH, United Kingdom. efraser-andrews@doctors.org.uk""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,['9007-49-2 (DNA)'],IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'CD4-CD8 Ratio', 'DNA/analysis', 'Female', '*Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte', '*Genes, T-Cell Receptor', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Sezary Syndrome/blood/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Survival Analysis']",2001/12/18 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/12/18 10:00'],"['2001/12/18 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/12/18 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer. 2001 Oct 1;92(7):1745-52. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(20011001)92:7<1745::aid-cncr1689>3.0.co;2-0.,,"['10.1002/1097-0142(20011001)92:7<1745::AID-CNCR1689>3.0.CO;2-0 [pii]', '10.1002/1097-0142(20011001)92:7<1745::aid-cncr1689>3.0.co;2-0 [doi]']",,,,['Copyright 2001 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,,

The authors report their experience with testicular sperm extraction (TESE) combined with intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) applied to azoospermic men who previously received chemotherapy for a variety of indications. METHODS: Among 231 cycles in 198 patients who underwent TESE-ICSI for nonobstructive azoospermia from 1995 to 2000, 20 TESE procedures in 17 patients who previously received chemotherapy were identified. All TESE procedures were performed with microsurgical control under local anesthesia with sedation or general anesthesia. The pretreatment hormonal profile, histology of testicular biopsies, and outcomes of TESE-ICSI in this subgroup of patients were analyzed. RESULTS: The mean patient age was 37.4 years (range, 28-54 years), and the mean follicle-stimulating hormone level was 21.8 mIU/mL (range, 7.1-43.1 mIU/mL). The mean age for female partners was 33.5 years (range, 22-43 years). Six patients had received chemotherapy for Hodgkin lymphoma (34%), four patients had received chemotherapy for testicular neoplasm (24%), two patients had received chemotherapy for non-Hodgkin lymphoma (12%), two patients had received chemotherapy for leukemia (12%), one patient had received chemotherapy for Wilms tumor (6%), one patient had received chemotherapy for mediastinal germ cell tumor (6%), and one patient had received chemotherapy for nephrotic syndrome (6%). Three patients (18%) received additional radiation therapy. The mean interval from chemotherapy to TESE was 16.3 years (range, 6-34 years). All patients had at least two semen analyses to confirm azoospermia. A total of 20 attempts of TESE-ICSI were performed (mean, 1.2 attempts per patient). Testicular histology revealed Sertoli cell-only pattern in 76% of patients. The remaining 24% of patients had hypospermatogenesis as their most advanced spermatogenic pattern. Among the men with Sertoli cell-only pattern, 23% had sperm retrieved by TESE. Sperm retrieval was accomplished in 9 of 20 attempts (45%), with biochemical pregnancy after sperm retrieval in 4 of 9 couples (45%) and clinical pregnancy in 3 of 9 couples (33%). Live deliveries were achieved in 2 of 9 couples (22%). Two healthy boys and one girl were delivered. No correlation was noted between the outcome of TESE-ICSI and the underlying conditions that were treated with chemotherapy nor with the chemotherapeutic agents used. CONCLUSIONS: Using TESE-ICSI, sperm retrieval leading to pregnancy and the delivery of healthy children is possible for men with long-standing azoospermia after chemotherapy. The prognosis for sperm retrieval was not influenced clearly by the chemotherapy regimen or the disease treated. Diagnostic biopsy also was of limited value in predicting the outcome of sperm retrieval. Despite prolonged nonobstructive azoospermia after undergoing chemotherapy, men no longer should be considered sterile in the era of advanced assisted reproductive techniques.","['Chan, P T', 'Palermo, G D', 'Veeck, L L', 'Rosenwaks, Z', 'Schlegel, P N']","['Chan PT', 'Palermo GD', 'Veeck LL', 'Rosenwaks Z', 'Schlegel PN']","['James Buchanan Brady Foundation, Department of Urology and Cornell Institute for Reproductive Medicine, New York, New York, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,['9002-68-0 (Follicle Stimulating Hormone)'],IM,,"['Adult', 'Cytoplasm', 'Female', 'Follicle Stimulating Hormone/analysis', 'Hodgkin Disease/drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Injections', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oligospermia/chemically induced/*therapy', 'Pregnancy', '*Reproductive Techniques, Assisted', '*Spermatozoa', 'Testis', 'Treatment Outcome']",2001/12/18 10:00,2002/01/10 10:01,['2001/12/18 10:00'],"['2001/12/18 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/10 10:01 [medline]', '2001/12/18 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer. 2001 Sep 15;92(6):1632-7. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(20010915)92:6<1632::aid-cncr1489>3.0.co;2-i.,,"['10.1002/1097-0142(20010915)92:6<1632::AID-CNCR1489>3.0.CO;2-I [pii]', '10.1002/1097-0142(20010915)92:6<1632::aid-cncr1489>3.0.co;2-i [doi]']",,,,['Copyright 2001 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,,

The authors assessed the risk of early-onset cancers in first- and second-degree relatives of patients enrolled by the National Wilms Tumor Study Group. METHODS: Using a stratified sampling scheme that targeted 530 families of patients who were believed a priori to have a genetic contribution to their disease, the authors conducted interviews regarding cancer occurrence in 4258 family members from 296 families of patients with Wilms tumor. Reports of malignant neoplasms that occurred before 55 years of age were confirmed by review of medical records wherever possible. A period of risk was defined for each family member based on calendar time and his or her relationship to the proband. RESULTS: Ninety-nine cancers were observed, whereas 126.8 were expected by applying standard cancer rates for age and calendar period to the 120,885 person-years at risk. The standardized incidence ratio (SIR) was O-E = 0.78 with 95% confidence interval (CI) of (0.64, 0.95). In subgroup analyses, the highest relative risks were observed for parents of the index case (O/E = 21/13.0 = 1.6, 95% CI = 1.0, 2.5) and for leukemia (O/E = 9/4.9 = 1.9, 95% CI= 0.85,3.5). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study may provide reassurance to families of children who have had Wilms tumor. Potential sources of bias included the low (56%) rate of participation of targeted families. In general, the biases might have led to the underreporting of some cancers, especially in more distant relatives. The possibility of a slight excess of cancer in parents of Wilms tumor patients could not be excluded.","['Felgenhauer, J L', 'Barce, J M', 'Benson, R L', 'Nan, B', 'Olson, J M', 'Breslow, N E']","['Felgenhauer JL', 'Barce JM', 'Benson RL', 'Nan B', 'Olson JM', 'Breslow NE']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA. felgenj@empirehealth.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,,"['Family', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Kidney Neoplasms/epidemiology/*genetics', 'Male', 'Medical Records', 'Middle Aged', 'Pedigree', 'Wilms Tumor/epidemiology/*genetics']",2001/12/18 10:00,2002/01/10 10:01,['2001/12/18 10:00'],"['2001/12/18 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/10 10:01 [medline]', '2001/12/18 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer. 2001 Sep 15;92(6):1606-12. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(20010915)92:6<1606::aid-cncr1486>3.0.co;2-i.,,"['10.1002/1097-0142(20010915)92:6<1606::AID-CNCR1486>3.0.CO;2-I [pii]', '10.1002/1097-0142(20010915)92:6<1606::aid-cncr1486>3.0.co;2-i [doi]']",,,,['Copyright 2001 American Cancer Society.'],,"['R01 CA054498/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-54498/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,

RESULTS: HHT and analogues appear to induce differentiation and apoptosis. Studies from China reported high response rates in patients with leukemia. Trials in the U.S. using short HHT infusions (3-4 mg/m(2) daily for 5 days) resulted in a high incidence of cardiovascular complications that were reduced using continuous infusion schedules of 3-7 mg/m(2) daily for 5-7 days initially, and later lower dose schedules of 2.5 mg/m(2) daily for 7-14 days. Results in solid tumors were negative. However encouraging results were reported in patients with acute myeloid leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, acute promyelocytic leukemia, and, most important, chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). In CML patients, HHT has been investigated alone and in combination with interferon-alpha and low-dose cytarabine in late and early chronic phases, with positive results. Additional areas of interest include the potential use of HHT for the treatment of central nervous system leukemia, polycythemia vera, and other nonmalignant conditions such as malaria. New semisynthetic preparations and HHT derivatives that bypass multidrug resistance may improve the efficacy and toxicity profiles, and broaden the range of antitumor efficacy. CONCLUSIONS: HHT and its derivatives appear to have promising activity in hematologic malignancies, a finding that needs to be pursued.","['Kantarjian, H M', 'Talpaz, M', 'Santini, V', 'Murgo, A', 'Cheson, B', ""O'Brien, S M""]","['Kantarjian HM', 'Talpaz M', 'Santini V', 'Murgo A', 'Cheson B', ""O'Brien SM""]","['Department of Leukemia, M.

METHODS: From 1985 to 1996, 34 HIV-infected men received a diagnosis of GCT. Their charts were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: Sixteen patients had seminomas, and 18 had nonseminomatous GCTs (NSGCT); 71% had International Union Against Cancer (UICC), 1997 Stage I-II GCTs. At the time of chemotherapy, 69%, 6%, and 25% of patients with advanced NSGCT were in the International Germ Cell Consensus Classification (IGCCC) good, intermediate, and poor prognostic group, respectively. All except 1 of the 10 patients with advanced seminomas were in the IGCCC good prognostic group. At diagnosis of GCT, 85% of patients were classified as having asymptomatic HIV infection or only persistent generalized lymphadenectomy. The median CD4 cell count was 325/microL (range, 6-1125). Overall, 26 patients were given chemotherapy, but the planned dose intensity was respected in only 15 (57%) patients. Severe toxic effects included febrile neutropenia in 35% of patients. During chemotherapy, zidovudine, prophylactic granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), and a Pneumocystis carinii prophylaxis were given in 19%, 23%, and 35% of cases, respectively. CD4 cell count decreased in 7 (64%) of 11 patients during chemotherapy. Infradiaphragmatic radiotherapy was given in 10 cases and was clinically well tolerated. At a median follow-up of 27 months (range, 3-150), 50% of patients were alive, and only 18% of patients died of GCT. Two patients developed a non-GCT malignancy while in complete remission, namely, Hodgkin disease and an acute leukemia. CONCLUSIONS: The prognosis of GCT in HIV-infected patients is mostly dictated by the HIV infection. Patients should be treated according to stage and histologic subtype, although dose reduction of chemotherapy might be necessary in approximately half of the patients. Close surveillance of neutrophil and CD4 cells counts, as well as the use of G-CSF and systematic anti-Pneumocystis carinii prophylaxis are recommended during chemotherapy. The use of highly active antiretroviral therapy during chemotherapy for GCT requires a prospective assessment.","['Fizazi, K', 'Amato, R J', 'Beuzeboc, P', 'Petit, N', 'Bouhour, D', 'Thiss, A', 'Rebischung, C', 'Chevreau, C', 'Logothetis, C J', 'Droz, J P']","['Fizazi K', 'Amato RJ', 'Beuzeboc P', 'Petit N', 'Bouhour D', 'Thiss A', 'Rebischung C', 'Chevreau C', 'Logothetis CJ', 'Droz JP']","['Department of Medicine, Institut Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France. fizazi@igr.fr']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '4B9XT59T7S (Zidovudine)']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'CD4 Lymphocyte Count', 'Germinoma/*therapy', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/therapeutic use', 'HIV Infections/*complications/drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Immune Tolerance', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutrophils', 'Pneumonia, Pneumocystis/prevention & control', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Seminoma/therapy', 'Zidovudine/therapeutic use']",2001/12/18 10:00,2002/01/10 10:01,['2001/12/18 10:00'],"['2001/12/18 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/10 10:01 [medline]', '2001/12/18 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer. 2001 Sep 15;92(6):1460-7. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(20010915)92:6<1460::aid-cncr1470>3.0.co;2-i.,,"['10.1002/1097-0142(20010915)92:6<1460::AID-CNCR1470>3.0.CO;2-I [pii]', '10.1002/1097-0142(20010915)92:6<1460::aid-cncr1470>3.0.co;2-i [doi]']",,,,['Copyright 2001 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,,

Although some general risk factors are known to predispose to systemic fungal infections, few studies have addressed the relevance of certain clinical and laboratory features in patients with CDC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: To define a subset of patients at high risk for CDC, the authors evaluated the demographics and clinical and laboratory characteristics of 423 patients with acute leukemia. Patients who had bone marrow transplant before the diagnosis of CDC were excluded from the analysis. The diagnosis of CDC was based on blood cultures, liver biopsy, and imaging studies. The authors conducted 2 separate regression analyses on 3 subsets of patients: patients without documented candidiasis (n = 374), patients with CDC (n = 23), and patients with candidemia (n = 26). RESULTS: According to multivariate analysis, younger age (P = 0.009; odds ratio [OR], 1.96; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.72-2.99), duration of neutropenia of 15 days or longer (P = 0.0003; OR, 11.7; 95% CI, 3.04-45.1), and use of prophylactic quinolone antibiotics (P = 0.039; OR, 3.85; 95% CI, 1.11-13.4) emerged as independent factors related to the development of CDC in patients with acute leukemia. The presence of severe mucositis, colonization with Candida, and administration of high-dose ara-C were statistically significant parameters in univariate analysis only (P = 0.0001, P = 0.003, and P = 0.058, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of the results of this investigation, it is possible to define a subset of patients with acute leukemia at very high risk for CDC. Because of the morbidity and mortality of this infection, a targeted prophylactic approach may be more effective and less costly than the random administration of antifungal agents.","['Sallah, S', 'Wan, J Y', 'Nguyen, N P', 'Vos, P', 'Sigounas, G']","['Sallah S', 'Wan JY', 'Nguyen NP', 'Vos P', 'Sigounas G']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of Tennessee, Memphis, Tennessee 38103, USA. ssallah@utmem.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Candidiasis/*etiology', 'Child', 'Chronic Disease', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications', 'Liver Diseases', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neutropenia/complications', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications', 'Splenic Diseases', 'Time Factors']",2001/12/18 10:00,2002/01/10 10:01,['2001/12/18 10:00'],"['2001/12/18 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/10 10:01 [medline]', '2001/12/18 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer. 2001 Sep 15;92(6):1349-53. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(20010915)92:6<1349::aid-cncr1457>3.0.co;2-e.,,"['10.1002/1097-0142(20010915)92:6<1349::AID-CNCR1457>3.0.CO;2-E [pii]', '10.1002/1097-0142(20010915)92:6<1349::aid-cncr1457>3.0.co;2-e [doi]']",,,,['Copyright 2001 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,,

Several new agents have been approved recently for orphan disease indications or unmet medical needs, based on response analyses. This has not been the case for chronic myelogenous leukemia in the blastic phase (CML-BP), despite its poor prognosis, because response has not been proven to be a valuable endpoint for survival prolongation. The purpose of this study was to analyze the effect of response in CML-BP on survival prolongation. STUDY GROUP AND METHODS In total, 328 patients with CML-BP referred from 1989 to 1999 were studied; 311 patients received therapy for CML-BP, and 275 were evaluable for response. Blastic phase CML was defined by the presence of 30% or more blasts in the blood or bone marrow, or extramedullary disease. Treatment responses were reviewed and categorized as proposed in previous large studies. Four categoric response groups were defined further based on significant differences in outcome: cytogenetic response, hematologic response, bone marrow improvement, and failure. The association of treatment response with survival was evaluated by multivariate and landmark analyses. RESULTS: The association of response with survival was analyzed among the 275 patients who had evaluable responses, and follow-up information was documented. Univariate analysis of pretreatment characteristics found performance status, hemoglobin levels, platelet counts, peripheral blasts, additional chromosomal abnormalities, and blastic phase morphology as showing significant associations with survival (P < 0.1). A multivariate analysis found platelet counts and blastic morphology as independent significant factors associated with survival (P < 0.05). A landmark analysis conducted at 8 weeks from start of therapy showed the beneficial effect of achieving response on survival prolongation (P < 0.001). A repeat multivariate at the 8-week landmark time in the 240 patients alive at that time, which included pretreatment characteristics and treatment response, confirmed the independent significant association of morphology (P = 0.003), platelet counts (P = 0.04), and response (P < 0.001) with survival. CONCLUSIONS: Response to therapy is a significant independent factor associated with survival prolongation and maybe an acceptable therapeutic endpoint for approving new treatments in CML-BP.","['Kantarjian, H M', 'Shan, J', 'Smith, T', 'Talpaz, M', 'Kozuch, P', 'Rios, M B', 'Cortes, J', 'Giles, F J', ""O'Brien, S""]","['Kantarjian HM', 'Shan J', 'Smith T', 'Talpaz M', 'Kozuch P', 'Rios MB', 'Cortes J', 'Giles FJ', ""O'Brien S""]","['Department of Leukemia, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030, USA. hkantarj@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Blast Crisis/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Platelet Count', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",2001/12/18 10:00,2002/01/10 10:01,['2001/12/18 10:00'],"['2001/12/18 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/10 10:01 [medline]', '2001/12/18 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer. 2001 Nov 15;92(10):2501-7. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(20011115)92:10<2501::aid-cncr1600>3.0.co;2-n.,,"['10.1002/1097-0142(20011115)92:10<2501::AID-CNCR1600>3.0.CO;2-N [pii]', '10.1002/1097-0142(20011115)92:10<2501::aid-cncr1600>3.0.co;2-n [doi]']",,,,['Copyright 2001 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,,

Abnormal expression levels of proteasomes have been described in tumor cells, and proteasomes can be detected and measured in plasma. The objective of this study was to characterize differences in proteasome levels between normal, healthy donors and patients with neoplastic disease and to correlate the findings with clinical status and other biologic markers of disease spread. METHODS: Plasma proteasome levels were measured using a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in normal donors (n = 73 donors) and in patients with solid tumors (n = 20 patients), acute leukemia (n = 35 patients), myeloproliferative (n = 37 patients) and myelodysplastic (n = 19 patients) syndromes, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (n = 44 patients), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (n =104 patients), Hodgkin disease (n = 14 patients), other lymphoid disorders (n = 17 patients), and multiple myeloma (n = 27 patients). RESULTS: In the normal donors, the plasma proteasome concentration was 2356 ng/mL +/- 127 ng/mL. Patients with solid tumors exhibited a significantly higher value (7589 ng/mL +/- 2124 ng/mL), similar to the patients with myeloproliferative (4099 ng/mL +/- 498 ng/mL) and myelodysplastic (2922 ng/mL +/- 322 ng/mL) syndromes. Patients with lymphoproliferative disorders, in contrast, had significantly lower values than normal donors (1751 ng/mL +/- 107 ng/mL), except those in aggressive phase of the disease. This low level persisted in patients who were in complete remission. Proteasome levels decreased during the initial phase of treatment. Although there was a significant correlation with serum lactic dehydrogenase levels, frequent discrepancies were noted. There was no correlation with C-reactive protein or beta2-microglobulin levels, even in the group of patients with multiple myeloma. CONCLUSIONS: The plasma proteasome level is a potential new tool for the monitoring of patients with neoplastic disease. It is not correlated solely with cell lysis and may be involved in the pathophysiology of disease progression.","['Lavabre-Bertrand, T', 'Henry, L', 'Carillo, S', 'Guiraud, I', 'Ouali, A', 'Dutaud, D', 'Aubry, L', 'Rossi, J F', 'Bureau, J P']","['Lavabre-Bertrand T', 'Henry L', 'Carillo S', 'Guiraud I', 'Ouali A', 'Dutaud D', 'Aubry L', 'Rossi JF', 'Bureau JP']","['Laboratoire de Biologie Cellulaire et Cytogenetique Moleculaire, Faculte de Medecine de Montpellier-Nimes, Nimes, France.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Multienzyme Complexes)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/*blood', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multienzyme Complexes/*blood', 'Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex']",2001/12/18 10:00,2002/01/10 10:01,['2001/12/18 10:00'],"['2001/12/18 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/10 10:01 [medline]', '2001/12/18 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer. 2001 Nov 15;92(10):2493-500. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(20011115)92:10<2493::aid-cncr1599>3.0.co;2-f.,,"['10.1002/1097-0142(20011115)92:10<2493::AID-CNCR1599>3.0.CO;2-F [pii]', '10.1002/1097-0142(20011115)92:10<2493::aid-cncr1599>3.0.co;2-f [doi]']",,,,['Copyright 2001 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,,

Monoclonal antibodies were modified with itaconic anhydride and copolymerized with N-isopropylacrylamide, and the ligand-conjugated carriers were added to the polyethylene glycol 8000-dextran T500 aqueous two-phase systems. The antibody-polymer conjugates were partitioned to the top phase in the absence or presence of 0.15 M NaCl. When ligand-conjugated carriers were used, more than 80% of the cells were specifically partitioned to the top phase in the presence of NaCl up to 0.1 M. The cells were partitioned almost completely to the bottom phase at 0.1 M NaCl or above, when no antibody-conjugate was added in the ATPS. As a model system, CD34-positive human acute myeloid leukemia cells (KG-1) were specifically separated from human T lymphoma cells (Jurkat) by applying anti-CD34 conjugated with poly-N-isopropylacrylamide in the aqueous two-phase system. By the temperature-induced precipitation of the polymer, about 90% of the antibody-polymer conjugates were recovered from the top phase, which gave approximately 75% cell separating efficiency in the next cycle of reuse.","['Kumar, A', 'Kamihira, M', 'Galaev, I Y', 'Mattiasson, B', 'Iijima, S']","['Kumar A', 'Kamihira M', 'Galaev IY', 'Mattiasson B', 'Iijima S']","['Department of Biotechnology, Graduate School of Engineering, Nagoya University, Chikusa-ku, Nagoya 464-8603, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biotechnol Bioeng,Biotechnology and bioengineering,7502021,"['0 (Acrylamides)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Polymers)', 'B7GFF17L9U (N-isopropylacrylamide)']",IM,,"['Acrylamides/chemistry', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/chemistry/*immunology', 'Antigens, CD34/*immunology', 'Cell Separation/*methods', 'Equipment Reuse', 'Flow Cytometry/methods', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Polymers/chemistry', 'Temperature', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/12/18 10:00,2002/03/22 10:01,['2001/12/18 10:00'],"['2001/12/18 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/22 10:01 [medline]', '2001/12/18 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biotechnol Bioeng. 2001 Dec 5;75(5):570-80. doi: 10.1002/bit.10080.,,"['10.1002/bit.10080 [pii]', '10.1002/bit.10080 [doi]']",,,,"['Copyright 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.']",,,,,,,,

Association with differentiation of hippocampal neurons, cerebellar granule cells, and macroglia.",7598-609,"BTB/POZ (broad complex tramtrack bric-a-brac/poxvirus and zinc finger) zinc finger factors are a class of nuclear DNA-binding proteins involved in development, chromatin remodeling, and cancer. However, BTB/POZ domain zinc finger factors linked to development of the mammalian cerebral cortex, cerebellum, and macroglia have not been described previously. We report here the isolation and characterization of two novel nuclear BTB/POZ domain zinc finger isoforms, designated HOF(L) and HOF(S), that are specifically expressed in early hippocampal neurons, cerebellar granule cells, and gliogenic progenitors as well as in differentiated glia. During embryonic development of the murine cerebral cortex, HOF expression is restricted to the hippocampal subdivision. Expression coincides with early differentiation of presumptive CA1 and CA3 pyramidal neurons and dentate gyrus granule cells, with a sharp decline in expression at the CA1/subicular border. By using bromodeoxyuridine labeling and immunohistochemistry, we show that HOF expression coincides with immature non-dividing cells and is down-regulated in differentiated cells, suggesting a role for HOF in hippocampal neurogenesis. Consistent with the postulated role of the POZ domain as a site for protein-protein interactions, both HOF isoforms are able to dimerize. The HOF zinc fingers bind specifically to the binding site for the related promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger protein as well as to a newly identified DNA sequence.","['Mitchelmore, Cathy', 'Kjaerulff, Karen M', 'Pedersen, Hans C', 'Nielsen, Jakob V', 'Rasmussen, Thomas E', 'Fisker, Mads F', 'Finsen, Bente', 'Pedersen, Karen M', 'Jensen, Niels A']","['Mitchelmore C', 'Kjaerulff KM', 'Pedersen HC', 'Nielsen JV', 'Rasmussen TE', 'Fisker MF', 'Finsen B', 'Pedersen KM', 'Jensen NA']","['Laboratory of Mammalian Molecular Genetics, The Panum Institute 6.5, University of Copenhagen, Blegdamsvej 3, DK-2200 Copenhagen N.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (ABTB1 protein, human)', '0 (Abtb1 protein, mouse)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Zbtb20 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)']",IM,,"['Alternative Splicing', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/*chemistry', 'Cerebellum/*metabolism', 'Cerebral Cortex/metabolism', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Complementary/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation', 'Gene Library', 'Glutathione Transferase/metabolism', 'Hippocampus/*metabolism', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neurons/*metabolism', 'Plasmids/metabolism', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/*chemistry', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', '*Transcription Factors', 'Two-Hybrid System Techniques', '*Zinc Fingers']",2001/12/18 10:00,2002/04/02 10:01,['2001/12/18 10:00'],"['2001/12/18 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/04/02 10:01 [medline]', '2001/12/18 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2002 Mar 1;277(9):7598-609. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M110023200.

Concern about potential adverse health effects was initially brought to prominence by an epidemiologic report two decades ago from Denver on childhood cancer. We reviewed the now voluminous epidemiologic literature on EMF and risks of chronic disease and conclude the following: a) The quality of epidemiologic studies on this topic has improved over time and several of the recent studies on childhood leukemia and on cancer associated with occupational exposure are close to the limit of what can realistically be achieved in terms of size of study and methodological rigor. b) Exposure assessment is a particular difficulty of EMF epidemiology, in several respects: i) The exposure is imperceptible, ubiquitous, has multiple sources, and can vary greatly over time and short distances. ii) The exposure period of relevance is before the date at which measurements can realistically be obtained and of unknown duration and induction period. iii) The appropriate exposure metric is not known and there are no biological data from which to impute it. c) In the absence of experimental evidence and given the methodological uncertainties in the epidemiologic literature, there is no chronic disease for which an etiological relation to EMF can be regarded as established. d) There has been a large body of high quality data for childhood cancer, and also for adult leukemia and brain tumor in relation to occupational exposure. Among all the outcomes evaluated in epidemiologic studies of EMF, childhood leukemia in relation to postnatal exposures above 0.4 microT is the one for which there is most evidence of an association. The relative risk has been estimated at 2.0 (95% confidence limit: 1.27-3.13) in a large pooled analysis. This is unlikely to be due to chance but, may be, in part, due to bias. This is difficult to interpret in the absence of a known mechanism or reproducible experimental support. In the large pooled analysis only 0.8% of all children were exposed above 0.4 microT. Further studies need to be designed to test specific hypotheses such as aspects of selection bias or exposure. On the basis of epidemiologic findings, evidence shows an association of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis with occupational EMF exposure although confounding is a potential explanation. Breast cancer, cardiovascular disease, and suicide and depression remain unresolved.","['Ahlbom, I C', 'Cardis, E', 'Green, A', 'Linet, M', 'Savitz, D', 'Swerdlow, A']","['Ahlbom IC', 'Cardis E', 'Green A', 'Linet M', 'Savitz D', 'Swerdlow A']","['Institute of Environmental Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden. anders.ahlblom@imm.ki.se']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Environ Health Perspect,Environmental health perspectives,0330411,,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis/*etiology', 'Brain Neoplasms/etiology', 'Breast Neoplasms/etiology', 'Cardiovascular Diseases/etiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chronic Disease', 'Confounding Factors, Epidemiologic', 'Depression/etiology', 'Electromagnetic Fields/*adverse effects', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/*etiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/etiology', '*Occupational Exposure', 'Pregnancy', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Research Design', 'Risk Assessment', 'Suicide']",2001/12/18 10:00,2002/01/24 10:01,['2001/12/18 10:00'],"['2001/12/18 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/24 10:01 [medline]', '2001/12/18 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Environ Health Perspect. 2001 Dec;109 Suppl 6:911-33. doi: 10.1289/ehp.109-1240626.,,"['sc271_5_1835 [pii]', '10.1289/ehp.109-1240626 [doi]']","['ICNIRP (International Commission for Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection) Standing', 'Committee on Epidemiology']",219,,,,,PMC1240626,,,,,

Nude mice received increasing doses of Rubitecan by intrastomach injection until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) had been established for both the single dose and the multiple doses at the schedule of 5 days on, 2 days off. Extrapolating from the mouse data, MTD was determined for oral administration in dogs and man. Levels of the drug in plasma were determined by high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). Using maximum tolerated multiple doses, the sensitivity of human cancer xenografts in nude mice to Rubitecan was determined. MTD of Rubitecan in mice for multiple doses intrastomach at the schedule of 5+,2- was 1 mg/kg/day. MTD in dogs was also 1 mg/kg/day, administered orally but at the schedule of 4+,3-. In man, it was 1 mg/m2/day at the schedule of 5+,2-. Treatment of human cancer xenografts in nude mice with MTD of Rubitecan resulted in 100% growth inhibition of 30/30 tumors tested and in 24/30 in their total disappearance. These 30 tumors comprised all the most common human cancers: lung, colorectal, breast, pancreatic, ovarian, prostate, stomach, melanoma and a leukemia. From the data collected, it appears that rubitecan is a very promising anticancer drug with high potency against a wide spectrum of human cancers. These cancers growing as xenografts in nude mice are always growth inhibited (30/30) and frequently (24/30) totally destroyed by the administration of non-toxic doses of Rubitecan.","['Giovanella, Beppino C', 'Stehlin, John S', 'Hinz, Hellmuth R', 'Kozielski, Anthony J', 'Harris, Nicholas J', 'Vardeman, Dana M']","['Giovanella BC', 'Stehlin JS', 'Hinz HR', 'Kozielski AJ', 'Harris NJ', 'Vardeman DM']","['The Stehlin Foundation for Cancer Research at Christus St. Joseph Hospital, Houston, TX 77003, USA. bcg@stehlin.org']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'H19C446XXB (rubitecan)', 'XT3Z54Z28A (Camptothecin)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology/*toxicity', 'Camptothecin/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology/*toxicity', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Dogs', 'Drug Administration Routes', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Female', 'Half-Life', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Maximum Tolerated Dose', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology']",2001/12/18 10:00,2002/02/14 10:01,['2001/12/18 10:00'],"['2001/12/18 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/14 10:01 [medline]', '2001/12/18 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2002 Jan;20(1):81-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The MOZ gene, which encodes a histone acetyltransferase (HAT), is also involved in some leukemia-associated translocations. We report here that MOZ is part of the AML1 complex and strongly stimulates AML1-mediated transcription. The stimulation of AML1-mediated transcription is independent of the inherent HAT activity of MOZ. Rather, a potent transactivation domain within MOZ appears to be essential for stimulation of AML1-mediated transcription. MOZ, as well as CBP and MOZ-CBP, can acetylate AML1 in vitro. The amount of AML1-MOZ complex increases during the differentiation of M1 myeloid cells into monocytes/macrophages, suggesting that the AML1-MOZ complex might play a role in cell differentiation. On the other hand, the MOZ-CBP fusion protein, which is created by the t(8;16) translocation associated with acute monocytic leukemia, inhibits AML1-mediated transcription and differentiation of M1 cells. These results suggest that MOZ-CBP might induce leukemia by antagonizing the function of the AML1 complex.","['Kitabayashi, I', 'Aikawa, Y', 'Nguyen, L A', 'Yokoyama, A', 'Ohki, M']","['Kitabayashi I', 'Aikawa Y', 'Nguyen LA', 'Yokoyama A', 'Ohki M']","['Cancer Genomics Division, National Cancer Center Research Institute, 5-1-1 Tsukiji, Chuo-ku, Tokyo 104-0045, Japan. ikitabay@gan2.ncc.go.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.3.1.- (Acetyltransferases)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (CREB-Binding Protein)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (CREBBP protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (Histone Acetyltransferases)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (KAT6A protein, human)']",IM,,"['Acetyltransferases/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'CREB-Binding Protein', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*physiology', 'Histone Acetyltransferases', 'Humans', 'Macrophages/cytology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nuclear Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Trans-Activators/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*physiology', 'Transcriptional Activation/*physiology']",2001/12/18 10:00,2002/02/09 10:01,['2001/12/18 10:00'],"['2001/12/18 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/09 10:01 [medline]', '2001/12/18 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,EMBO J. 2001 Dec 17;20(24):7184-96. doi: 10.1093/emboj/20.24.7184.,,['10.1093/emboj/20.24.7184 [doi]'],,,,,,,PMC125775,,,,,

Valproic acid relieves HDAC-dependent transcriptional repression and causes hyperacetylation of histones in cultured cells and in vivo. Valproic acid inhibits HDAC activity in vitro, most probably by binding to the catalytic center of HDACs. Most importantly, valproic acid induces differentiation of carcinoma cells, transformed hematopoietic progenitor cells and leukemic blasts from acute myeloid leukemia patients.

DESIGNS: Prospective cohort. SETTING: A university department of pediatrics. PARTICIPANTS: Seventy-five consecutive children who underwent BMT were enrolled in the study (median age, 11 years; range, 6 to 19 years; 45 male and 30 female children). Twenty-three children received autologous BMT, and 52 children received allogeneic BMT; 50 children completed the study. MEASUREMENTS: Clinical examinations and lung function tests were performed before BMT, and 3 to 6 months, 12 months, and 24 months after BMT. RESULTS: Before BMT, at 3 to 6 months after BMT, and at 24 months after BMT, 44%, 85%, and 62% of children, respectively, had altered lung function in the absence of persistent respiratory symptoms. Between 3 months and 6 months after BMT, a restrictive pattern was the most frequent abnormality. The only predictive factors for late abnormalities were transplantation performed in the advanced disease phase (odds ratio [OR], 6.75; p = 0.005) and bronchopulmonary infections (OR, 3.9; p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that a significant proportion of children who undergo BMT, especially if for leukemia in advanced phase, have early and late pulmonary abnormalities. These abnormalities, especially the late ones, seem to be more severe than patients reported in studies analyzing children undergoing BMT in the 1980s. This could be due to the more intensive front-line treatment protocols employed for treatment of children with acute leukemia in the 1990s.","['Cerveri, I', 'Fulgoni, P', 'Giorgiani, G', 'Zoia, M C', 'Beccaria, M', 'Tinelli, C', 'Locatelli, F']","['Cerveri I', 'Fulgoni P', 'Giorgiani G', 'Zoia MC', 'Beccaria M', 'Tinelli C', 'Locatelli F']","['Clinic of Respiratory Diseases, Department of Pediatrics, Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico, Policlinico ""San Matteo"", Pavia, Italy. isa@mbox.systemy.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Chest,Chest,0231335,,IM,,"['Adolescent', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Cytomegalovirus Infections/diagnosis/etiology', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Forced Expiratory Volume', 'Graft vs Host Disease/diagnosis/etiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Lung Diseases/diagnosis/*etiology', 'Male', 'Postoperative Complications/*etiology', 'Prospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Vital Capacity']",2001/12/18 10:00,2002/01/16 10:01,['2001/12/18 10:00'],"['2001/12/18 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/16 10:01 [medline]', '2001/12/18 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Chest. 2001 Dec;120(6):1900-6. doi: 10.1378/chest.120.6.1900.,,"['S0012-3692(15)38620-7 [pii]', '10.1378/chest.120.6.1900 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

However, it has been reported that the fungal metabolite adenophostin A [which has a severalfold higher affinity than Ins(1,4,5)P(3) for Ins(1,4,5)P(3) receptors] consistently activates the current under similar conditions. Here, whole-cell patch clamp experiments have been performed to examine how adenophostin A can activate the store-operated Ca(2+) current (I(CRAC)) in RBL-1 (rat basophilic leukaemia) cells. In a strong intracellular Ca(2+) buffer, saturating concentrations of adenophostin A activated I(CRAC) maximally and the current amplitude and kinetics were indistinguishable from those obtained with high concentrations of Ins(1,4,5)P(3). In a weak Ca(2+) buffer, adenophostin A consistently activated I(CRAC), but the current was submaximal. High concentrations of Ins(1,4,5)P(3) or the non-metabolizable analogue Ins(2,4,5)P(3) were largely ineffective under these conditions. The size of I(CRAC) to adenophostin A in weak Ca(2+) buffer could be significantly increased by either inhibiting sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic-reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase ('SERCA') pumps with thapsi-gargin or enhancing mitochondrial Ca(2+) uptake, although blocking the mitochondrial Ca(2+) uniporter with Ruthenium Red did not suppress the activation of the current. Changing the levels of free ATP in the recording pipette did not enhance the size of I(CRAC) evoked by adenophostin A. We also examined two structurally distinct analogues of adenophostin A (manno-adenophostin and ribophostin), for which the affinities for the Ins(1,4,5)P(3) receptor are similar to that of Ins(1,4,5)P(3) in equilibrium binding experiments. Although these analogues were able to activate I(CRAC) to its maximal extent in strong buffer, ribophostin, but not manno-adenophostin, consistently activated the current in weak buffer. We conclude that adenophostin A and ribophostin are able to activate I(CRAC) in weak buffer through a mechanism that is quite distinct from that employed by Ins(1,4,5)P(3) and manno-adenophostin and is not related to equilibrium affinities.","['Parekh, Anant B', 'Riley, Andrew M', 'Potter, Barry V L']","['Parekh AB', 'Riley AM', 'Potter BV']","['Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Signalling, Department of Physiology, University of Oxford, Parks Road, Oxford OX1 3PT, U.K. anant.parekh@physiol.ox.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (Buffers)', '0 (Calcium Channel Agonists)', '0 (Calcium Channels)', '0 (Disaccharides)', '0 (Inositol Phosphates)', '0 (Sugar Phosphates)', '0 (manno-adenophostin)', '0 (ribophostin)', '149091-92-9 (adenophostin A)', '85166-31-0 (Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', '91840-07-2 (inositol 2,4,5-trisphosphate)', 'K72T3FS567 (Adenosine)']",IM,,"['Adenosine/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Adenosine Triphosphate/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Buffers', 'Calcium Channel Agonists/*pharmacology', 'Calcium Channels/drug effects/metabolism', 'Calcium Signaling/*drug effects', 'Disaccharides/*pharmacology', 'Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate/*pharmacology', 'Inositol Phosphates/pharmacology', 'Intracellular Fluid/drug effects/metabolism', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/metabolism', 'Patch-Clamp Techniques', 'Rats', 'Sugar Phosphates/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/12/18 10:00,2002/02/20 10:01,['2001/12/18 10:00'],"['2001/12/18 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/20 10:01 [medline]', '2001/12/18 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem J. 2002 Jan 1;361(Pt 1):133-41. doi: 10.1042/0264-6021:3610133.,,['10.1042/0264-6021:3610133 [doi]'],,,,,,,PMC1222288,,,,,

In murine cells, HIV-1 Gag fails to reach the plasma membrane and instead forms nonfunctional intracellular aggregates. The viral determinants of this species incompatibility are previously undefined. To address this problem, we replaced a region of HIV-1 Gag known to direct its localization, the matrix (MA) domain, with functionally homologous regions from Moloney murine leukemia virus (MLV), a murine retrovirus. An HIV-1 clone carrying such a chimeric Gag protein, designated murine HIV (MHIV), assembled more efficiently than nonchimeric HIV-1 and restored plasma membrane localization of Gag in murine cells. Increased efficiency of viral assembly in murine cells was observed from MHIV constructs carrying MLV MA in place of HIV-1 MA. Efficient processing of the HIV-1 capsid protein from the chimeric Gag polyprotein and subsequent infectivity of MHIV required the presence of MLV p12 in addition to MLV MA. These findings strongly suggest that the HIV-1 MA domain of HIV-1 Gag is responsible for the assembly defect in mouse cells. Although these MHIV do not recruit native HIV-1 Env efficiently, they are capable of single-round infection when produced by high-efficiency transfection of human 293 cells and provided with an HIV-1 Env lacking its cytoplasmic tail. With further adaptation, this chimeric MHIV approach may provide the basis for creating an infectious mouse model for HIV/AIDS.","['Chen, B K', 'Rousso, I', 'Shim, S', 'Kim, P S']","['Chen BK', 'Rousso I', 'Shim S', 'Kim PS']","['Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, Department of Biology, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Nine Cambridge Center, Cambridge, MA 02142, USA. benchen@wi.mit.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line', '*Chimera', 'DNA Primers', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Gene Products, gag/*genetics', 'HIV-1/genetics/*physiology', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', '*Virus Assembly']",2001/12/14 10:00,2002/01/23 10:01,['2001/12/14 10:00'],"['2001/12/14 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/23 10:01 [medline]', '2001/12/14 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2001 Dec 18;98(26):15239-44. doi: 10.1073/pnas.261563198.

BLV transcription is regulated by cis-acting elements located in the U3 region, including three 21-bp enhancers required for transactivation of the BLV promoter by the virus-encoded transactivator Tax(BLV). In addition to the U3 cis-acting elements, both the R and U5 regions contain stimulatory sequences. To date, no transcription factor-binding site has been identified in the R region. Here sequence analysis of this region revealed the presence of a potential E box motif (5'-CACGTG-3'). By competition and supershift gel shift assays, we demonstrated that the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors USF1 and USF2 specifically interacted with this R region E box motif. Mutations abolishing upstream stimulatory factor (USF) binding caused a reproducible decrease in basal or Tax-activated BLV promoter-driven gene expression in transient transfection assays of B-lymphoid cell lines. Cotransfection experiments showed that the USF1 and USF2a transactivators were able to act through the BLV R region E box. Taken together, these results physically and functionally characterize a USF-binding site in the R region of BLV.

Cancer-preventive constituents of fruits and vegetables may inhibit carcinogen activation, enhance carcinogen detoxification, prevent carcinogens from interacting with critical target sites, or impede tumor progression. These activities, however, are achievable only when levels of individual bioactive constituents reach beyond those attainable from a normal balanced diet. Isoprenoids, a broad class of mevalonate-derived phytochemicals ubiquitous in the plant kingdom, suppress the proliferation of tumor cells and the growth of implanted tumors. A search for volatile isoprenoid constituents of food products spanning seven plant families identified 179 isoprenoids. Of these, 41 purchased from commercial sources were screened for efficacy in suppressing the proliferation of murine B16 melanoma cells. Individual isoprenoids suppressed the proliferation of B16 and HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells with varying degrees of potency. Cell cycle arrest at the G(0)-G(1) phase and apoptosis account, at least in part, for the suppression. Blends of isoprenoids suppressed B16 and HL-60 cell proliferation with efficacies equal to the sum of the individual impacts. These findings suggest that the cancer-protective property of fruits, vegetables, and related products is partly conferred by the cumulative impact of volatile isoprenoid constituents.","['Tatman, Dana', 'Mo, Huanbiao']","['Tatman D', 'Mo H']","[""Department of Nutrition and Food Sciences, Texas Woman's University, Denton, TX 76204, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Ireland,Cancer Lett,Cancer letters,7600053,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Butadienes)', '0 (Hemiterpenes)', '0 (Pentanes)', '0 (Polyisoprenyl Phosphates)', '0 (Terpenes)', '0A62964IBU (isoprene)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Butadienes/chemistry/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Cycle/*drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', '*Fruit', 'HL-60 Cells', '*Hemiterpenes', 'Humans', 'Melanoma, Experimental/*pathology/prevention & control', 'Mice', '*Pentanes', '*Phytotherapy', '*Plants, Medicinal', 'Polyisoprenyl Phosphates', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Terpenes/*therapeutic use', '*Vegetables']",2001/12/14 10:00,2002/02/02 10:01,['2001/12/14 10:00'],"['2001/12/14 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/02 10:01 [medline]', '2001/12/14 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Lett. 2002 Jan 25;175(2):129-39. doi: 10.1016/s0304-3835(01)00723-6.,,"['S0304383501007236 [pii]', '10.1016/s0304-3835(01)00723-6 [doi]']",,,,,,['CA 73418/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,

The morphological pattern of cell death was characterized by swelling of the cytoplasmic compartments, cytosolic vacuolation, disruption of the plasma membrane, less evident nuclear condensation, and faint DNA fragmentation, all of which were consistent with oncosis or cytoplasmic apoptosis. The nonreceptor protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor herbimycin A accelerated the induction of typical apoptosis by X irradiation, which was demonstrated by morphological assessments using nuclear staining and electron microscopy as well as oligonucleosomal fragmentation and caspase 3 activity. Herbimycin A is known to be a selective antagonist of the BCR/ABL kinase of Philadelphia chromosome-positive K562 cells; this kinase blocks the induction of apoptosis after X irradiation. Our results showed that the inhibition of protein tyrosine kinase by herbimycin A enhanced radiation-induced apoptosis in K562 cells. This effect was associated with the activation of caspase 3 and rapid abrogation of the G(2)-phase checkpoint with progression out of G(2) into G(1) phase. In contrast, the receptor-type protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein protected K562 cells from all types of radiation-induced cell death through the inhibition of caspase 3 activity and prolonged maintenance of G(2)-phase arrest. Further investigations using this model may give valuable information about the mechanisms of radiation-induced apoptosis and about the radiosensitivity and radioresistance of chronic myelogenous leukemia cells having the Philadelphia chromosome.","['Jeong, S J', 'Jin, Y H', 'Moon, C W', 'Bae, H R', 'Yoo, Y H', 'Lee, H S', 'Lee, S H', 'Lim, Y J', 'Lee, J D', 'Jeong, M H']","['Jeong SJ', 'Jin YH', 'Moon CW', 'Bae HR', 'Yoo YH', 'Lee HS', 'Lee SH', 'Lim YJ', 'Lee JD', 'Jeong MH']","['The Institute of Medical Science, Dong-A University College of Medicine, Pusan, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Radiat Res,Radiation research,0401245,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,,"['Apoptosis/*radiation effects', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', '*Radiation Tolerance', 'X-Rays']",2001/12/14 10:00,2002/01/25 10:01,['2001/12/14 10:00'],"['2001/12/14 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/25 10:01 [medline]', '2001/12/14 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Radiat Res. 2001 Dec;156(6):751-60. doi: 10.1667/0033-7587(2001)156[0751:ptkimr]2.0.co;2.,,['10.1667/0033-7587(2001)156[0751:ptkimr]2.0.co;2 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

This population-based case-control study investigated the association between prenatal exposure to diagnostic X-ray examinations (for different types of examinations and at different stages of pregnancy) and the risk of childhood lymphatic and myeloid leukemia. All children born and diagnosed with leukemia between 1973-1989 in Sweden (578 lymphatic and 74 myeloid) were selected as cases, and each was matched (by sex and year of birth) to a healthy control child (excluding Down's syndrome). Exposure data were abstracted blindly from all available medical records. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated by conditional logistic regression. It was found that prenatal X-ray examinations resulting in direct fetal exposure were not associated with a significant overall increased risk for childhood leukemia (OR = 1.11, 95% CI 0.83-1.47), for lymphatic leukemia (OR = 1.04, 95% CI 0.77-1.40), or for myeloid leukemia (OR = 1.49, 95% CI 0.48-4.72). There was little evidence of a dose response or variation in risk by trimester of exposure or age at diagnosis.

However, the combinations of disease, drug, and genetic test characteristics that will provide clinically useful and economically feasible therapeutic interventions have not been clearly elucidated. The purpose of this paper was to develop a framework for evaluating the potential cost-effectiveness of pharmacogenomic strategies that will help scientists better understand the strategic implications of their research, assist in the design of clinical trials, and provide a guide for health care providers making reimbursement decisions. We reviewed concepts of cost-effectiveness analysis and pharmacogenomics and identified 5 primary characteristics that will enhance the cost-effectiveness of pharmacogenomics: 1) there are severe clinical or economic consequence that are avoided through the use of pharmacogenomics, 2) monitoring drug response using current methods is difficult, 3) a well-established association between genotype and clinical phenotype exists, 4) there is a rapid and relatively inexpensive genetic test, and 5) the variant gene is relatively common. We used this framework to evaluate several examples of pharmacogenomics. We found that pharmacogenomics offers great potential to improve patients' health in a cost-effective manner. However, pharmacogenomics will not be applied to all currently marketed drugs, and careful evaluations are needed on a case-by-case basis before investing resources in research and development of pharmacogenomic-based therapeutics and making reimbursement decisions.","['Veenstra, D L', 'Higashi, M K', 'Phillips, K A']","['Veenstra DL', 'Higashi MK', 'Phillips KA']","['Pharmaceutical Outcomes Research and Policy Program and Public Health Genetics Program, University of Washington, Department of Pharmacy, Seattle, WA 98195, USA. veenstra@u.washington.edu']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,AAPS PharmSci,AAPS pharmSci,100897065,"['0 (Anticholesteremic Agents)', '0 (Anticoagulants)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (CETP protein, human)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cholesterol Ester Transfer Proteins)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '49717AWG6K (Ribavirin)', '5Q7ZVV76EI (Warfarin)', '9008-11-1 (Interferons)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.67 (thiopurine methyltransferase)', 'KXO2KT9N0G (Pravastatin)']",IM,,"['Anticholesteremic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Anticoagulants/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/therapeutic use', 'Cardiovascular Diseases/drug therapy/economics/enzymology', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics', 'Child', 'Cholesterol Ester Transfer Proteins', 'Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Drug Therapy/*economics', 'Genotype', '*Glycoproteins', 'Hepatitis C/drug therapy/economics', 'Humans', 'Interferons/therapeutic use', 'Mercaptopurine/therapeutic use', 'Methyltransferases/deficiency', 'Pharmacogenetics/*economics', 'Pharmacology, Clinical/economics/*methods', 'Phenotype', 'Pravastatin/therapeutic use', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/economics/enzymology', 'Ribavirin/therapeutic use', 'Warfarin/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use']",2001/12/14 10:00,2002/02/16 10:01,['2001/12/14 10:00'],"['2001/12/14 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/16 10:01 [medline]', '2001/12/14 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,AAPS PharmSci. 2000;2(3):E29. doi: 10.1208/ps020329.,,['10.1208/ps020329 [doi]'],,,,,,,PMC2761139,,,,,

Emerging evidence also supports a role for these molecules in postembryonic tissues, particularly in pathological processes, including tissue injury and tumor metastasis. We review the signaling mechanisms that allow the 14 Eph and nine ephrin proteins to deliver intracellular signals that regulate cell shape and movement. What emerges is that the initiation of these signals is critically dependent on which Eph and ephrin proteins are expressed, the level of their expression, and, in some cases, which splice variants are expressed. Diversity at the level of initial interaction and in the downstream signaling processes regulated by Eph-ephrin signaling provides a subtle, versatile system of regulation of intercellular adhesion, cell shape, and cell motility.","['Boyd, A W', 'Lackmann, M']","['Boyd AW', 'Lackmann M']","['Leukaemia Foundation Laboratory, Queensland Institute of Medical Research, P.O.

A CpG dinucleotide within a STAT3 binding element in the GFAP promoter is highly methylated in E11.5 neuroepithelial cells, but is demethylated in cells responsive to the STAT3 activation signal to express GFAP. This CpG methylation leads to inaccessibility of STAT3 to the binding element.

Thalidomide (Thal), as well as derivative immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs), directly induce apoptosis or G1 growth arrest in MM cell lines and patient's MM cells which are resistant to melphalan (Mel), doxorubicin (Dox), and dexamethasone (Dex). Although Thal and IMiDs do not alter adhesion of MM cells to bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs), they inhibit the upregulation of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) secretion triggered by the binding of MM cells to BMSCs. Proteasome inhibitors represent another potential anticancer therapy targeting the MM cell and the BM microenvironment. The proteasome inhibitor PS-341 directly inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in both human MM cell lines and freshly isolated patient's MM cells which are resistant to Mel, Dox, and Dex. PS-341 inhibits p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) growth signaling triggered by IL-6 and induces apoptosis, despite induction of p21 and p27, in p53 wild-type and p53 mutant MM cells. PS-341 adds to the anti-MM activity of dexamethasone and overcomes IL-6-mediated protection against dexamethasone-induced apoptosis. PS-341 blocks the paracrine growth of human MM cells by decreasing their adherence to BMSCs and related NF-kappaB-dependent induction of IL-6 secretion in BMSCs. Moreover, proliferation and MAPK growth signaling of those residual adherent MM cells is also inhibited. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), which is produced by some MM cells, induces only low-level MM proliferation and MAPK activation in MM cells, but markedly upregulates IL-6 secretion from BMSCs and upregulates expression of adhesion molecules (VLA-4 and LFA-1) on MM cells and their receptors (VCAM-1 and ICAM-1) on BMSCs, with resultant increased binding of MM cells to BMSCs. Inhibition of TNF-alpha-induced NF-kappaB activation with PS-341 inhibits both the upregulation of these molecules on MM cells and BMSCs and the resultant increased adhesion. Therefore, inhibiting TNF-alpha and its sequelae may be useful treatment strategies in MM. Our data show that VEGF causes proliferation and enhances migration of MM as well as plasma cell leukemia (PCL) cells. VEGF induced twofold activation of cell migration in MM cells and more than 100-fold activation of cell migration in PCL cells, suggesting an important role of VEGF in the progression of MM to PCL. These data indicate that VEGF plays a pivotal role not only in neoangiogenesis in MM BM but also in proliferation and migration of tumor cells.","['Hideshima, T', 'Chauhan, D', 'Podar, K', 'Schlossman, R L', 'Richardson, P', 'Anderson, K C']","['Hideshima T', 'Chauhan D', 'Podar K', 'Schlossman RL', 'Richardson P', 'Anderson KC']","['Department of Adult Oncology, Jerome Lipper Multiple Myeloma Center, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, 44 Binney Street, Boston, MA 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Semin Oncol,Seminars in oncology,0420432,"['0 (Adjuvants, Immunologic)', '0 (Angiogenesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Endothelial Growth Factors)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Multienzyme Complexes)', '0 (Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors)', '0 (Protease Inhibitors)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors)', '4Z8R6ORS6L (Thalidomide)', ""EC 3.1.4.17 (3',5'-Cyclic-AMP Phosphodiesterases)"", 'EC 3.1.4.17 (Cyclic Nucleotide Phosphodiesterases, Type 4)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",IM,,"[""3',5'-Cyclic-AMP Phosphodiesterases/antagonists & inhibitors"", 'Adjuvants, Immunologic/therapeutic use', 'Angiogenesis Inhibitors/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Bone Marrow/blood supply/*drug effects', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cyclic Nucleotide Phosphodiesterases, Type 4', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Endothelial Growth Factors/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Lymphokines/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Multienzyme Complexes/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Multiple Myeloma/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic', 'Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Protease Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex', 'Thalidomide/analogs & derivatives/*therapeutic use', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors']",2001/12/12 10:00,2002/01/16 10:01,['2001/12/12 10:00'],"['2001/12/12 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/16 10:01 [medline]', '2001/12/12 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Semin Oncol. 2001 Dec;28(6):607-12. doi: 10.1016/s0093-7754(01)90033-8.,,"['S0093775401002767 [pii]', '10.1016/s0093-7754(01)90033-8 [doi]']",,41,,['Copyright 2001 by W.B.

Furthermore, in today's Internet age of information, a large fraction of a patient's medical knowledge and/or opinions may have been obtained and forged online, with input from other patients, and patients are clearly more informed about their illnesses and their options than in the past. The availability of imatinib mesylate has already profoundly changed the nature and sequence of treatment recommendations for patients with chronic myeloid leukemia, but a great deal still remains to be learned and new clinical trials must be designed to address numerous questions about the optimal use of this powerful new medication.","['Schiffer, C A']",['Schiffer CA'],"['Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Center Institute, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, MI, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Semin Oncol,Seminars in oncology,0420432,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Interferon-alpha/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/therapy', 'Orphan Drug Production', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects']",2001/12/12 10:00,2002/01/11 10:01,['2001/12/12 10:00'],"['2001/12/12 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/11 10:01 [medline]', '2001/12/12 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Semin Oncol. 2001 Oct;28(5 Suppl 17):34-9.,,['asonc02805o0034 [pii]'],,5,,['Copyright 2001 by W.B.

Since then, several related genes have been identified constituting a family of ligands (primarily PDGF A and B) and their cognate receptors (PDGF-R alpha and beta). To date, PDGF expression has been shown in a number of different solid tumors, from glioblastomas to prostate carcinomas. In these various tumor types, the biologic role of PDGF signaling can vary from autocrine stimulation of cancer cell growth to more subtle paracrine interactions involving adjacent stroma and even angiogenesis.

These tumors span a wide clinical spectrum from benign to malignant and have long been recognized for their nearly absolute resistance to chemotherapy and radiation treatment. Surgery is the primary treatment modality for GISTs, but GISTs represent an incurable malignancy for patients with metastatic or unresectable disease. Thus, novel approaches to the treatment of GISTs were desperately needed. Gastrointestinal stromal tumors are characterized by expression of the transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase KIT, which is defined by the CD117 antigen and is the product of the c-kit proto-oncogene. Activating or gain-of-function mutations in the c-kit gene have been identified in the majority of GIST cases. The resulting constitutive KIT tyrosine kinase activity was hypothesized to provide growth and survival signals to GIST cells and to be crucial to the pathogenesis of the disease. This hypothesis became testable with the identification of the signal transduction inhibitor imatinib mesylate (formerly STI571, [Gleevec]; Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corp, East Hanover, NJ), which blocks the tyrosine kinase activity of KIT as well as the kinase activity of the normal c-abl gene product, the oncogenic Bcr-Abl chimeric fusion protein of chronic myeloid leukemia, and the platelet-derived growth factor receptor. Preclinical experiments showed rapid inhibition of ligand-independent KIT phosphorylation, decreased cellular proliferation, and induction of apoptosis after exposure of GIST cells to imatinib mesylate in vitro. These results provided the rationale to move forward with clinical testing of imatinib mesylate as an anticancer therapy for GIST. In early 2000, a dramatic clinical and radiographic response to imatinib mesylate was shown in a single patient with advanced, chemotherapy-resistant GIST. The powerful scientific rationale for this proof-of-concept study, together with the durable and significant response observed in this first GIST patient treated with imatinib mesylate, have provided the driving force for rapid clinical development of this targeted therapy in this solid tumor indication.","['Demetri, G D']",['Demetri GD'],"['Department of Adult Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Semin Oncol,Seminars in oncology,0420432,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)']",IM,,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Gastrointestinal Neoplasms/*drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Mesoderm', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Prognosis', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/*genetics', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use']",2001/12/12 10:00,2002/01/11 10:01,['2001/12/12 10:00'],"['2001/12/12 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/11 10:01 [medline]', '2001/12/12 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Semin Oncol. 2001 Oct;28(5 Suppl 17):19-26.,,['asonc02805o0019 [pii]'],,41,,['Copyright 2001 by W.B.

One targeted therapy that has shown great success is the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate (formerly STI571, [Gleevec]; Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corp, East Hanover, NJ) which was recently approved for the treatment of Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Basic scientific investigation into the molecular causes and pathogenesis of CML and encouraging preclinical investigations on the mechanism of action of imatinib mesylate led to the initiation of phase I clinical trials. Clinical development of imatinib mesylate continued with three large, multicenter, phase II trials. The majority (88%) of interferon-alpha-resistant or intolerant patients in chronic-phase CML achieved a complete hematologic response to imatinib mesylate. More importantly, approximately half of patients achieved a major cytogenetic response, a result historically associated with improved survival. Furthermore, 21% of patients in accelerated-phase CML and 13.5% of patients in blastic-phase CML (patient populations with typically poor prognosis before the advent of imatinib mesylate) achieved major cytogenetic responses. Results from ongoing studies will determine the durability of these responses and will evaluate ways to optimize treatment in advanced-stage patients using imatinib mesylate in combination with other therapies.

Identifying the appropriate intracellular targets and understanding the signal transduction pathways in which these molecules participate are critical to this process. A large number of the activated oncogenes implicated in the pathogenesis and progression of malignancy are tyrosine kinases. Bcr-Abl, the causative molecular abnormality in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), is a prototypic oncogenic kinase and an attractive drug target. The tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate (formerly STI571, [Gleevec]; Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corp, East Hanover, NJ) was recently approved for the treatment of CML and provides proof of principle for the strategy of targeted signal transduction inhibition. This drug is effective in the chronic phase of CML, a single gene disorder driven by Bcr-Abl, and in the advanced phases of CML, showing that inhibition of a single oncogene in a multigene disorder also may be of benefit. The success of imatinib mesylate in CML led rapidly to clinical trials in other cancers associated with activation of two other tyrosine kinases known to be sensitive to imatinib mesylate, c-Kit and the platelet-derived growth factor receptor. Gastrointestinal stromal tumors, which have activating mutations in c-Kit, are now also being found to respond to kinase inhibition with the drug.

Laboratory assessments show profound hemostatic imbalance in this condition, with activation of coagulation, fibrinolysis, and nonspecific proteolysis systems.

HIPK2 is activated by ultraviolet (UV) radiation and selectively phosphorylates p53 at Ser 46, thus facilitating the CBP-mediated acetylation of p53 at Lys 382, and promoting p53-dependent gene expression. Accordingly, the kinase function of HIPK2 mediates the increased expression of p53 target genes, which results in growth arrest and the enhancement of UV-induced apoptosis.

Hypothesizing that the alterations in T-lymphocyte number and function observed during zinc deficiency may result from changes in gene expression, we sought to compare thymic mRNA expression profiles of zinc-deficient and zinc-normal mice utilizing cDNA arrays. For our murine model described herein, 3 wk of dietary zinc deficiency did not perturb food intake or growth rate in young adult, outbred mice, but significantly depressed multiple parameters of zinc status. Furthermore, fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis demonstrated no changes in thymocyte populations expressing the cell surface markers CD3, CD4 or CD8, establishing that observed changes in mRNA abundances were not attributable to different thymocyte populations. Yet notably, at this moderate level of zinc deficiency, cDNA array analysis identified four potentially zinc-regulated mRNAs whose modulation was confirmed independently, twice, using both semiquantitative and real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction.

The addition of Tax, CREB, and p300 to the HTLV-1 promoter assembled into chromatin activated transcription several hundredfold.

Integrated provirus titers per milliliter were determined for these phenotypically mixed virions, and vector proviruses were screened to determine what percentage contained repeat deletions. The results revealed a steady decline in direct repeat deletion frequency that correlated with decreases in functional RNase H, with greater than fourfold decreases in repeat deletion frequency observed when 95% of virion reverse transcriptase was RNase H defective. Parallel experiments were performed to address effects of molar excesses of RNase H relative to functional DNA polymerase. These experiments demonstrated that increasing the stoichiometry of RNase H relative to the amount of functional DNA polymerase had minimal effects on direct repeat deletion frequency. DNA synthesis was error prone when directed principally by RNase H mutant reverse transcriptase, suggesting a role for RNase H catalytic integrity in the fidelity of intracellular reverse transcription.","['Brincat, Jennifer L', 'Pfeiffer, Julie K', 'Telesnitsky, Alice']","['Brincat JL', 'Pfeiffer JK', 'Telesnitsky A']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109-0620, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)', 'EC 2.7.7.6 (DNA-Directed RNA Polymerases)', 'EC 3.1.26.4 (Ribonuclease H)']",IM,,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'DNA-Directed RNA Polymerases/physiology', 'Gene Deletion', 'Humans', 'Lac Operon', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/enzymology/genetics/*physiology', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Proviruses/physiology', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/genetics/metabolism', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'Ribonuclease H/*metabolism', 'Templates, Genetic', 'Virus Replication/physiology']",2001/12/12 10:00,2002/01/11 10:01,['2001/12/12 10:00'],"['2001/12/12 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/11 10:01 [medline]', '2001/12/12 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2002 Jan;76(1):88-95. doi: 10.1128/jvi.76.1.88-95.2002.,,['10.1128/jvi.76.1.88-95.2002 [doi]'],,,,,,"['T32 GM007544/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM 07544/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",PMC135712,,,,,

MCF 247, the prototype of this group of nonacute murine leukemia viruses, transforms thymocytes, in part, by insertional mutagenesis and enhancer-mediated dysregulation of cellular proto-oncogenes. The unique 3' (U3) regions in the long terminal repeats of other murine leukemia viruses contain transcription factor binding sites known to be important for enhancer function and for the induction of T-cell lymphomas. Although transcription factor binding sites important for the biological properties of MCF 247 have not been identified, pathogenesis studies from our laboratory suggested to us that binding sites for Ikaros, a lymphoid-cell-restricted transcriptional regulator, affect the biological properties of MCF 247. In this report, we demonstrate that Ikaros binds to predicted sites in U3 sequences of MCF 247 and that site-directed mutations in these sites greatly diminish this binding in vitro. Consistent with these findings, ectopic expression of Ikaros in murine cells that do not normally express this protein significantly increases transcription from the viral promoter in transient gene expression assays. Moreover, site-directed mutations in specific Ikaros-binding sites reduce this activity in T-cell lines that express Ikaros endogenously. To determine whether the Ikaros-binding sites are functional in vivo, we inoculated newborn mice with a variant MCF virus containing a mutant Ikaros-binding site. The variant virus replicated in thymocytes less efficiently and induced lymphomas with a delayed onset compared to the wild-type virus. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that the Ikaros-binding sites in the U3 region of MCF 247 are functional and cooperate with other DNA elements for optimal enhancer function in vivo.","['DiFronzo, Nancy L', 'Leung, Cheuk T', 'Mammel, Mark K', 'Georgopoulos, Katia', 'Taylor, Barbara J', 'Pham, Quynh N']","['DiFronzo NL', 'Leung CT', 'Mammel MK', 'Georgopoulos K', 'Taylor BJ', 'Pham QN']","[""Center for Virology, Immunology, and Infectious Disease Research, Children's National Medical Center, George Washington University School of Medicine and Health Sciences, Washington, DC 20010, USA. ndifronzo@cnmc.org""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"[""0 (3' Untranslated Regions)"", '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (IKZF1 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Zfpn1a1 protein, mouse)', '148971-36-2 (Ikaros Transcription Factor)']",IM,,"[""3' Untranslated Regions/genetics/metabolism"", '3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line', '*DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Humans', 'Ikaros Transcription Factor', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia, Experimental/virology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred AKR', 'Mink Cell Focus-Inducing Viruses/genetics/*pathogenicity', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Protein Binding', 'Retroviridae Infections/virology', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism/*physiology', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Virus Infections/virology']",2001/12/12 10:00,2002/01/11 10:01,['2001/12/12 10:00'],"['2001/12/12 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/11 10:01 [medline]', '2001/12/12 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2002 Jan;76(1):78-87. doi: 10.1128/jvi.76.1.78-87.2002.,,['10.1128/jvi.76.1.78-87.2002 [doi]'],,,,,,,PMC135716,,,,,

By using human U937 leukemia cells, it was previously shown that such an adaptive response can be induced without increasing the cellular capacity to degrade H2O2, thus conferring on the cells a cross-resistance to other stimuli such as serum withdrawal and C2-ceramide. In this study, it was found that stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun N-terminal kinase (SAPK/JNK) acts as a common mediator of the cell death induced by high H2O2 concentrations, serum withdrawal and C2-ceramide. Although SAPK/JNK activation by H2O2 was mediated by two upstream mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinases MKK4 and MKK7, only MKK7 played such a role in serum withdrawal and C2-ceramide. Interestingly, all these lethal stimuli failed to activate SAPK/JNK and its upstream kinases in the cells that were pretreated with low adaptive concentrations of H2O2. By contrast, the phosphorylation levels of extracellular signal-regulated kinase and p38 MAPK were not significantly influenced by this H2O2 pretreatment. Inducing the SAPK/JNK-suppressing effect of H2O2 required a time lag, which correlated with the time lag required for the induction of the adaptive response. Overall, the results suggest that H2O2 adaptation confers on cells a resistance to multiple stimuli by specifically blocking their ability to activate the SAPK/JNK pathways.","['Kim, D K', 'Cho, E S', 'Seong, J K', 'Um, H D']","['Kim DK', 'Cho ES', 'Seong JK', 'Um HD']","['Laboratory of Cell Biology, Yonsei Medical Research Center, Yonsei University College of Medicine, CPO Box 8044, Seoul 120-752, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Cell Sci,Journal of cell science,0052457,"['0 (N-acetylsphingosine)', '0 (Oxidants)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 4)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 7)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP2K4 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP2K7 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases)', 'NGZ37HRE42 (Sphingosine)']",IM,,"['Adaptation, Physiological', '*Apoptosis', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/*pharmacology', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases', '*MAP Kinase Kinase 4', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 7', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Oxidants/*pharmacology', '*Signal Transduction', 'Sphingosine/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'U937 Cells']",2001/12/12 10:00,2002/03/01 10:01,['2001/12/12 10:00'],"['2001/12/12 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/01 10:01 [medline]', '2001/12/12 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Cell Sci. 2001 Dec;114(Pt 23):4329-34.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the setting of acute lung injury, the percentage of apoptotic cells among lung neutrophils is decreased. The transcriptional regulatory factor NF-kappaB is activated in neutrophils and other pulmonary cell populations after endotoxemia and appears to play a central role in the development of the acute inflammatory process that leads to lung injury. Because NF-kappaB can modulate apoptosis through increasing expression of anti-apoptotic proteins, activation of NF-kappaB may contribute to the alterations in lung neutrophil apoptosis associated with acute lung injury. In the present experiments, endotoxemia resulted in decreased apoptosis and increased expression of anti-apoptotic mediators among lung neutrophils. Amounts of A1, A20, and Bcl-x(L), anti-apoptotic proteins whose transcription is dependent on NF-kappaB, were increased in lung neutrophils after endotoxemia. Inhibition of nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB increased the percentage of apoptotic lung neutrophils after endotoxemia, but not back to the levels found in unmanipulated animals. Although inhibition of nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB prevented endotoxemia-induced increases in Bcl-x(L), A1, and A20 in lung neutrophils, this intervention did not prevent endotoxemia-associated elevation of Mcl-1, an anti-apoptotic protein primarily under the transcriptional regulation of CREB.

However, in advanced phases, especially blast crisis, the leukemia usually becomes resistant within months. It has been investigated whether resistance to STI571 is stable and immutable or whether it can be reversed in selected CML cell lines. Withdrawal of STI571 for varying lengths of time from cultures of 3 resistant lines (K562-r, KCL22-r, and Baf/BCR-ABL-r1) did not restore sensitivity to the inhibitor. In contrast, LAMA84-resistant cells experienced a sharp reduction in survival and proliferation during the first week of STI571 withdrawal but recovered thereafter. Moreover, when left off the inhibitor for 2 months or longer, this cell line reacquired sensitivity to STI571. It is hypothesized, therefore, that patients who have become resistant to the drug may respond again if STI571 therapy is temporarily interrupted.","['Tipping, A J', 'Mahon, F X', 'Lagarde, V', 'Goldman, J M', 'Melo, J V']","['Tipping AJ', 'Mahon FX', 'Lagarde V', 'Goldman JM', 'Melo JV']","['Department of Haematology, Imperial College School of Medicine, Hammersmith Hospital, London, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Casp3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Benzamides', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Mice', 'Phosphorylation', 'Piperazines', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/12/12 10:00,2002/01/12 10:01,['2001/12/12 10:00'],"['2001/12/12 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/12 10:01 [medline]', '2001/12/12 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2001 Dec 15;98(13):3864-7. doi: 10.1182/blood.v98.13.3864.,,"['10.1182/blood.v98.13.3864 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)38488-3 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Results of this study showed that ET-18-OCH(3) induces cocapping of Fas and membrane rafts, specialized plasma membrane regions involved in signaling, before the onset of apoptosis in human leukemic cells. Patches of membrane rafts accumulated Fas clusters in leukemic cells treated with ET-18-OCH(3). Sucrose gradient centrifugation of Triton X-100 cell lysates showed that Fas translocated into membrane rafts following ET-18-OCH(3) treatment of T-leukemic Jurkat cells. Disruption of membrane raft integrity by methyl-beta-cyclodextrin or filipin inhibited ET-18-OCH(3)-induced apoptosis in leukemic primary cells and cell lines. Fas clustering was also inhibited by methyl-beta-cyclodextrin. These data indicate that ET-18-OCH(3) reorganizes membrane rafts to trigger apoptosis in human leukemic cells, and that Fas coaggregation with membrane rafts is required for ET-18-OCH(3)-induced apoptosis.

In unstimulated THP-1 and AML cells, LILRE oligonucleotide probes bound only to STAT1 alpha and beta isoforms. The LILRE element showed a significant increase in binding of both alpha and beta isoforms of STAT1 and STAT3 upon IFN-gamma and IL-6 stimulation. Similar results were observed with human monocytes upon IL-6 or IFN-gamma stimulation.

Iron transport and expression of the 2 isoforms of DMT1 was studied in erythroid cells that consume large quantities of iron for biosynthesis of hemoglobin. In mk/mk mice that express a loss-of-function mutant variant of DMT1, reticulocytes have a decreased cellular iron uptake and iron incorporation into heme. Interestingly, iron release from transferrin inside the endosome is normal in mk/mk reticulocytes, suggesting a subsequent defect in Fe(++) transport across the endosomal membrane. Studies by immunoblotting using membrane fractions from peripheral blood or spleen from normal mice where reticulocytosis was induced by erythropoietin (EPO) or phenylhydrazine (PHZ) treatment suggest that DMT1 is coexpressed with transferrin receptor (TfR) in erythroid cells. Coexpression of DMT1 and TfR in reticulocytes was also detected by double immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy. Experiments with isoform-specific anti-DMT1 antiserum strongly suggest that it is the non-iron-response element containing isoform II of DMT1 that is predominantly expressed by the erythroid cells. As opposed to wild-type reticulocytes, mk/mk reticulocytes express little if any DMT1, despite robust expression of TfR, suggesting a possible effect of the mutation on stability and targeting of DMT1 isoform II in these cells. Together, these results provide further evidence that DMT1 plays a central role in iron acquisition via the transferrin cycle in erythroid cells.","['Canonne-Hergaux, F', 'Zhang, A S', 'Ponka, P', 'Gros, P']","['Canonne-Hergaux F', 'Zhang AS', 'Ponka P', 'Gros P']","['Department of Biochemistry, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Cation Transport Proteins)', '0 (Hemoglobins)', '0 (Iron-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Phenylhydrazines)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Transferrin)', '0 (solute carrier family 11- (proton-coupled divalent metal ion transporters),', 'member 2)', '064F424C9K (phenylhydrazine)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', '42VZT0U6YR (Heme)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)']",IM,,"['Anemia/*blood', 'Animals', 'Biological Transport/genetics', 'CHO Cells', 'Cation Transport Proteins/*blood/genetics/physiology', 'Cricetinae', 'Endosomes/chemistry/metabolism', 'Erythrocyte Membrane/metabolism', 'Erythrocytes/*chemistry/ultrastructure', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/chemistry/ultrastructure', 'Erythropoietin/pharmacology', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Heme/metabolism', 'Hemoglobins/biosynthesis', 'Homozygote', 'Iron/blood', '*Iron-Binding Proteins', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Mice', 'Mice, Mutant Strains', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Mutation', 'Phenylhydrazines/pharmacology', 'Protein Isoforms/genetics', 'Reticulocyte Count', 'Reticulocytes/drug effects/metabolism', 'Spleen/drug effects/metabolism', 'Transferrin/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/12/12 10:00,2002/01/12 10:01,['2001/12/12 10:00'],"['2001/12/12 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/12 10:01 [medline]', '2001/12/12 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2001 Dec 15;98(13):3823-30. doi: 10.1182/blood.v98.13.3823.,,"['10.1182/blood.v98.13.3823 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)38480-9 [pii]']",,,,,,['AI355237/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,

It occurs during late erythroid development and results in inclusion of the 10-kd domain needed for stabilization of the spectrin/actin lattice. In this study, an experimental model was established in murine erythroleukemia cells that reproduces the endogenous exon 16 splicing patterns from a transfected minigene. Exon 16 was excluded in predifferentiated and predominantly included after induction. This suggests that the minigene contained exon and abutting intronic sequences sufficient for splicing regulation. A systematic analysis of the cis-acting regulatory sequences that reside within the exon and flanking introns was performed. Results showed that (1) the upstream intron of 4.1R pre-mRNA is required for exon recognition and it displays 2 enhancer elements, a distal element acting in differentiating cells and a proximal constitutive enhancer that resides within the 25 nucleotides preceding the acceptor site; (2) the exon itself contains a strong constitutive splicing silencer; (3) the exon has a weak 5' splice site; and (4) the downstream intron contains at least 2 splicing enhancer elements acting in differentiating cells, a proximal element at the vicinity of the 5' splice site, and a distal element containing 3 copies of the UGCAUG motif. These results suggest that the interplay between negative and positive elements may determine the inclusion or exclusion of exon 16.

Northern blot experiments revealed expression of CD2 messenger RNA in HMC-1, whereas primary nonneoplastic MCs did not express transcripts for CD2.

Analysis by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) indicated that both patients were negative for the BCR-ABL fusion, but suggested that the BCR gene was disrupted. Further FISH indicated a breakpoint within fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1), the receptor tyrosine kinase that is known to be disrupted in a distinctive myeloproliferative disorder, most commonly by fusion to ZNF198. RT-PCR confirmed the presence in both cases of an in-frame messenger RNA fusion between BCR exon 4 and FGFR1 exon 9. Expression of BCR-FGFR1 in the factor-dependent cell line Ba/F3 resulted in interleukin 3-independent clones that grew at a comparable rate to cells transformed with ZNF198-FGFR1. The growth of transformed cells was inhibited by the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002, the farnesyltransferase inhibitors L744832 and manumycin A, the p38 inhibitors SB202190 and SB203580 but not by the MEK inhibitor PD98059. The growth of BaF3/BCR-FGFR1 and BaF3/ZNF198-FGFR1 was not significantly inhibited by treatment with STI571, but was inhibited by SU5402, a compound with inhibitory activity against FGFR1. Inhibition with this compound was associated with decreased phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and BCR-FGFR1 or ZNF198-FGFR1, and was dose dependent with an inhibitory concentration of 50% of approximately 5 microM. As expected, growth of BaF3/BCR-ABL was inhibited by STI571 but not by SU5402. The study demonstrates that the BCR-FGFR1 fusion may occur in patients with apparently typical CML. Patients with constitutively active FGFR1 fusion genes may be amenable to treatment with specific FGFR1 inhibitors.","['Demiroglu, A', 'Steer, E J', 'Heath, C', 'Taylor, K', 'Bentley, M', 'Allen, S L', 'Koduru, P', 'Brody, J P', 'Hawson, G', 'Rodwell, R', 'Doody, M L', 'Carnicero, F', 'Reiter, A', 'Goldman, J M', 'Melo, J V', 'Cross, N C']","['Demiroglu A', 'Steer EJ', 'Heath C', 'Taylor K', 'Bentley M', 'Allen SL', 'Koduru P', 'Brody JP', 'Hawson G', 'Rodwell R', 'Doody ML', 'Carnicero F', 'Reiter A', 'Goldman JM', 'Melo JV', 'Cross NC']","['Department of Haematology, Imperial College School of Medicine, Hammersmith Hospital, London, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Pyrroles)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Fibroblast Growth Factor)', '0 (SU 5402)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FGFR1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 1)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (BCR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr)']",IM,,"['Aged', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Division', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 22', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oncogene Proteins/chemistry/*genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr', 'Pyrroles/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/chemistry/*genetics', 'Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 1', 'Receptors, Fibroblast Growth Factor/chemistry/*genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transfection', '*Translocation, Genetic']",2001/12/12 10:00,2002/01/12 10:01,['2001/12/12 10:00'],"['2001/12/12 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/12 10:01 [medline]', '2001/12/12 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2001 Dec 15;98(13):3778-83. doi: 10.1182/blood.v98.13.3778.,,"['10.1182/blood.v98.13.3778 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)38474-3 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Fas plays an important role in T-cell-mediated cytotoxicity, and recently it has been suggested that altered Fas signaling may contribute to drug resistance. Therefore, Fas resistance could be one of the mechanisms by which AML progenitors escape chemotherapy or T-cell-based immune intervention. However, the molecular mechanism of Fas resistance in AML cells has not been identified. Fas signaling can be interrupted at 3 mains levels: Fas clustering, alteration of death-inducing-signaling-complex (DISC) formation, and effector caspase inhibition of downstream caspase-8. This study shows that in the Fas-resistant CD34(+)CD38(-) KG1a cells, Fas agonists resulted in Fas aggregation but not in caspase-8 activation, related to a defect in DISC formation. However, pretreatment with chelerythrin, but not with calphostin C, resulted in the restoration of Fas-induced caspase-8 activation and cytotoxicity, suggesting that some atypical protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms contributed to the lack of DISC formation. Indeed, treatment with antisense oligonucleotides directed against PKC zeta and enforced expression of Par-4, a negative regulator of PKC zeta activity, restored Fas-induced caspase-8 activity and apoptosis. Moreover, it was found that PKC zeta interacts with FADD and that PKC zeta immunoextracts prepared from KG1a cells are able to phosphorylate FADD in vitro, whereas this phosphorylation is dramatically reduced in Par-4 transfectant cells. In conclusion, it is suggested that in AML cells, PKC zeta plays an important role in Fas resistance by inhibiting DISC formation, possibly by phosphorylating FADD.","['de Thonel, A', 'Bettaieb, A', 'Jean, C', 'Laurent, G', 'Quillet-Mary, A']","['de Thonel A', 'Bettaieb A', 'Jean C', 'Laurent G', 'Quillet-Mary A']","['INSERM E9910, Institut Claudius Regaud, Toulouse, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Benzophenanthridines)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Naphthalenes)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Phenanthridines)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '0 (prostate apoptosis response-4 protein)', 'E3B045W6X0 (chelerythrine)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP8 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'I271P23G24 (calphostin C)']",IM,,"['Alkaloids', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'Benzophenanthridines', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics/physiology', 'Caspase 8', 'Caspase 9', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique, Indirect', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', '*Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Isoenzymes/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*enzymology/*immunology', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Naphthalenes/pharmacology', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/pharmacology', 'Phenanthridines/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase C/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'fas Receptor/immunology/*physiology']",2001/12/12 10:00,2002/01/12 10:01,['2001/12/12 10:00'],"['2001/12/12 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/12 10:01 [medline]', '2001/12/12 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2001 Dec 15;98(13):3770-7. doi: 10.1182/blood.v98.13.3770.,,"['10.1182/blood.v98.13.3770 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)38473-1 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The recent report that arsenic trioxide induces apoptosis in HTLV-1-transformed cells prompted investigation of the mechanism of action of this drug in HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 interleukin-2-independent T cells and in HTLV-1-immortalized cells or in ex vivo ATLL samples. Fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis, fluorescence microscopy, and measures of mitochondrial membrane potential (Delta Psi m) demonstrated that arsenic trioxide alone was sufficient to induce programmed cell death in all HTLV-1 and -2 cells tested and in ATLL patient samples. I kappa B-alpha phosphorylation strongly decreased, and NF-kappa B translocation to the nucleus was abrogated. Expression of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-X(L), whose promoter is NF-kappa B dependent, was down-regulated. The collapse of Delta Psi m and the release of cytochrome c to the cytosol resulted in the activation of caspase-3, as demonstrated by the cleavage of PARP. A specific caspase-3 inhibitor (Ac-DEVD-CHO) could reverse this phenotype. The antiapoptotic factor Bcl-2 was then cleaved, converting it to a Bax-like death effector. These results demonstrated that arsenic trioxide induces apoptosis in HTLV-1- and -2-infected cells through activation of the caspase pathway.","['Mahieux, R', 'Pise-Masison, C', 'Gessain, A', 'Brady, J N', 'Olivier, R', 'Perret, E', 'Misteli, T', 'Nicot, C']","['Mahieux R', 'Pise-Masison C', 'Gessain A', 'Brady JN', 'Olivier R', 'Perret E', 'Misteli T', 'Nicot C']","[""Unite d'Epidemiologie et Physiopathologie des Virus Oncogenes, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France. rmahieux@pasteur.fr""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Cytochrome c Group)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (I-kappa B Proteins)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (NFKBIA protein, human)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '139874-52-5 (NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cytochrome c Group/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*physiology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 2/*physiology', 'Humans', '*I-kappa B Proteins', 'Interferon-alpha/pharmacology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*pathology/virology', 'Membrane Potentials', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Mitochondria/ultrastructure', 'NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/analysis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/analysis/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/analysis', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein', 'bcl-X Protein']",2001/12/12 10:00,2002/01/12 10:01,['2001/12/12 10:00'],"['2001/12/12 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/12 10:01 [medline]', '2001/12/12 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2001 Dec 15;98(13):3762-9. doi: 10.1182/blood.v98.13.3762.,,"['10.1182/blood.v98.13.3762 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)38472-X [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Patient cells show chromosome instability and hypersensitivity to DNA cross-linking agents. At least 8 complementation groups (A-G) have been identified and 6 FA genes (for subtypes A, C, D2, E, F, and G) have been cloned. Increasing evidence indicates that a protein complex assembly of multiple FA proteins, including FANCA and FANCG, plays a crucial role in the FA pathway. Previously, it was reported that FANCA was phosphorylated in lymphoblasts from normal controls, whereas the phosphorylation was defective in those derived from patients with FA of multiple complementation groups. The present study examined phosphorylation of FANCA ectopically expressed in FANCA(-) cells. Several patient-derived mutations abrogated in vivo phosphorylation of FANCA in this system, suggesting that FANCA phosphorylation is associated with its function. In vitro phosphorylation studies indicated that a physiologic protein kinase for FANCA (FANCA-PK) forms a complex with the substrate. Furthermore, at least a part of FANCA-PK as well as phosphorylated FANCA were included in the FANCA/FANCG complex. Thus, FANCA-PK appears to be another component of the FA protein complex and may regulate function of FANCA. FANCA-PK was characterized as a cytoplasmic serine kinase sensitive to wortmannin.

To evaluate the possibility of exploiting the human CD2 LCR to regulate gene expression by Moloney murine leukemia virus (Mo-MLV)-based retroviral vectors in T cells, it was included in vectors carrying the enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) reporter gene; then transduction in vitro of lymphoid and nonlymphoid cell lines was performed. Deletion of the viral enhancer in the Mo-MLV long terminal repeat was necessary to detect LCR activity in the context of these retroviral vectors. It was found that a full-length (2.1 kb), but not a truncated (1.0 kb), CD2 LCR retained the ability to modulate reporter gene expression by Mo-MLV-derived retroviral vectors, leading to a homogeneous, unimodal pattern of EGFP expression that remained unmodified in culture over time, specifically in T-cell lines; on the other hand, viral titer was strongly reduced compared with vectors not carrying the LCR. Lentiviral vectors containing the CD2 LCR could be generated at higher titers and were used to analyze its effects on gene expression in primary T cells. Subcutaneous implantation of genetically modified cells in immunodeficient mice showed that retroviral vectors carrying the CD2 LCR conferred an advantage in terms of transgene expression in vivo, compared with the parental vector, by preventing the down-modulation of EGFP expression. These findings suggest a potential application of this LCR to increase gene expression by retroviral and lentiviral vectors in T lymphocytes.","['Indraccolo, S', 'Minuzzo, S', 'Roccaforte, F', 'Zamarchi, R', 'Habeler, W', 'Stievano, L', 'Tosello, V', 'Klein, D', 'Gunzburg, W H', 'Basso, G', 'Chieco-Bianchi, L', 'Amadori, A']","['Indraccolo S', 'Minuzzo S', 'Roccaforte F', 'Zamarchi R', 'Habeler W', 'Stievano L', 'Tosello V', 'Klein D', 'Gunzburg WH', 'Basso G', 'Chieco-Bianchi L', 'Amadori A']","['IST-Viral and Molecular Oncology Section, the Department of Oncology and Surgical Sciences, University of Padua, Italy. stefano.indraccolo@unipd.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (CD2 Antigens)', '0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']",IM,,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Blotting, Southern', 'CD2 Antigens/*genetics', 'Cell Line', '*Gene Expression', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'Humans', 'Kidney', 'Lentivirus/*genetics', '*Locus Control Region', 'Luminescent Proteins/genetics', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Transfection']",2001/12/12 10:00,2002/01/12 10:01,['2001/12/12 10:00'],"['2001/12/12 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/12 10:01 [medline]', '2001/12/12 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2001 Dec 15;98(13):3607-17. doi: 10.1182/blood.v98.13.3607.,,"['10.1182/blood.v98.13.3607 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)38452-4 [pii]']",,,,,,['A.126/Telethon/Italy'],,,,,,

All patients had follicular or small cell lymphocytic lymphoma after relapse from a prior response to conventional chemotherapy. Patients received a preparative regimen of fludarabine (25 mg/m(2) given daily for 5 days or 30 mg/m(2) daily for 3 days) and intravenous cyclophosphamide (1 g/m(2) given daily for 2 days or 750 mg/m(2) daily for 3 days). Nine patients received rituximab in addition to the chemotherapy. Tacrolimus and methotrexate were used for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis. Twenty patients were studied; their median age was 51 years. Twelve were in complete remission (CR) at transplantation. All patients achieved engraftment of donor cells. The median number of days with severe neutropenia was 6. Only 2 patients required more than one platelet transfusion. The cumulative incidence of acute grade II to IV GVHD was 20%. Only one patient developed acute GVHD of greater than grade II. All patients achieved CR. None have had a relapse of disease, with a median follow-up period of 21 months. The actuarial probability of being alive and in remission at 2 years was 84% (95% confidence interval, 57%-94%). Nonablative chemotherapy with fludarabine/cyclophosphamide followed by allogeneic stem cell transplantation is a promising therapy for indolent lymphoma with minimal toxicity and myelosuppression.

The incidence of boys, younger age (< 6 months old), and hyperleukocytosis at onset was high in patients with the M4/M5 subtype (n = 23) in the French-American-British classification, compared with the non-M4/M5 subtype (n = 12). Thirteen (56%) and 16 (70%) patients with the M4/M5 subtype also showed 11q23 translocations and MLL gene rearrangements, respectively, whereas only one patient with the non-M4/M5 subtype had this rearrangement. All 35 patients were treated with the ANLL91 protocol consisting of etoposide, high-dose cytarabine, and anthracyclines. Overall survival and the event-free survival (EFS) rates at 3 years of all patients were 76% (95% confidence interval [CI], 61.3%-90.7%) and 72% (95% CI, 56.4%-87.9%), respectively. EFS showed no significant difference between 2 subgroups divided by age, gender, presence of the MLL gene rearrangements, and white blood cell count at onset; EFS in patients with the M4/M5 subtype tended to be better than those with the non-M4/M5 subtype. Although all 6 patients who underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) have been in complete remission, no benefit of SCT was confirmed. These findings suggest that the intensive chemotherapy with the ANLL91 protocol might have been responsible for the observed good outcome of infant AML, even without SCT.

These trials were not randomized, and patients with worse prognoses were disproportionately given the FA and TA regimens. Nonetheless, after accounting for prognosis the FA and TA regimens remained highly significantly associated with lower CR rates, shorter EFS in CR, and shorter survival. Accounting for possible effects of individual trials within each of the IA, FA, and TA groups did not alter these findings.

Late complications were analyzed after adjustment for patient age and for acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). CML patients who received CY-TBI had an increased risk of cataract formation, and patients treated with Bu-CY had an increased risk of irreversible alopecia. Chronic GVHD was the primary risk factor for late pulmonary disease and avascular osteonecrosis. Thus, Bu-CY and CY-TBI provided similar probabilities of cure for patients with CML. In patients with AML, a nonsignificant 10% lower survival rate was observed after Bu-CY.

Type 1 interferons (IFNs) are clinically important in infectious diseases and in the treatment of leukemia and lymphomas. Many different cell types have the capacity to produce IFN-alpha after encounter with virus and bacteria. The major, natural type 1 IFN-producing cell in humans was recently described as the plasmacytoid T cell, or pDC2, and it can differentiate into dendritic cells (DCs) on culture. This study describes the murine natural IFN-alpha-producing cell, or pDC2, that shares morphologic features with its human counterpart but has some distinct phenotypical characteristics. Murine plasmacytoid DCs can be differentially isolated based on their expression of CD11c, B220 (CD45R), and Thy1.2 (CD90). They lack expression of myeloid (eg, CD11b) antigens and CD8 alpha, a marker used to isolate lymphoid DCs. Like human pDC2, murine plasmacytoid DCs exhibit their maximal type 1 IFN-producing capacity at a precursor stage; pDCs isolated from bone marrow responded to viral stimulation with higher IFN-alpha production than cells of the same phenotype isolated from spleen. Mobilization of mice with Flt3 ligand (Flt3L) or Flt3L and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, hematopoietic factors that specifically enhance DC growth, resulted in strikingly increased numbers of pDC in bone marrow and spleen. The isolation of this novel murine DC subset may serve as a useful tool in the study of viral immunobiology and for the design of treatments for murine malignancies.","['Bjorck, P']",['Bjorck P'],"['Department of Dermatology, University of Pittsburgh, PA 15213, USA. bjorckp@msx.upmc.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (CD11 Antigens)', '0 (CD40 Antigens)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Thy-1 Antigens)', '0 (flt3 ligand protein)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 1)', 'I223NX31W9 (Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology/immunology', 'CD11 Antigens/analysis', 'CD40 Antigens/analysis', 'Cell Differentiation', '*Cell Separation', 'Dendritic Cells/cytology/*immunology', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology', 'Interferon-alpha/biosynthesis', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens/analysis', 'Membrane Proteins/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 1', 'Spleen/cytology', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/immunology', 'Thy-1 Antigens/analysis']",2001/12/12 10:00,2002/01/12 10:01,['2001/12/12 10:00'],"['2001/12/12 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/12 10:01 [medline]', '2001/12/12 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2001 Dec 15;98(13):3520-6. doi: 10.1182/blood.v98.13.3520.,,"['10.1182/blood.v98.13.3520 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)38440-8 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

MDS is characterized by trilineage dysplasia and by ineffective hematopoiesis. The etiology of MDS is poorly understood. However, the frequent association of chromosomal abnormalities (deletions, inversions, translocations, trisomies and monosomies) with MDS suggests that an oncogene, or a tumor suppressor gene might be involved in the pathogenesis and evolution of this disorder.

In addition, this review goes into the discussion of the most recent development in the field of molecular biology to understand some of the mechanisms resulting in the development and progression of MDS.","['Mhawech, P', 'Saleem, A']","['Mhawech P', 'Saleem A']","['Department of Pathology, University Hospital of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,Crit Rev Oncol Hematol,Critical reviews in oncology/hematology,8916049,,IM,,"['Chromosome Aberrations', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Humans', 'Mutation', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/etiology/*genetics/pathology', 'Prognosis']",2001/12/12 10:00,2002/08/02 10:01,['2001/12/12 10:00'],"['2001/12/12 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/02 10:01 [medline]', '2001/12/12 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Crit Rev Oncol Hematol. 2001 Dec;40(3):229-38. doi: 10.1016/s1040-8428(01)00101-9.,,"['S1040842801001019 [pii]', '10.1016/s1040-8428(01)00101-9 [doi]']",,65,,,,,,,,,,

The percentage of bone marrow blasts, the number of cytopenic cell lines and cytogenetics define more precisely clinical risk groups. In the high-risk MDS, the time for evolution to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is between 0.2 and 1.1 years and the median survival has been evaluated between 0.4 and 1.2 years. Progress in the understanding the biology of MDS and the development of accurate prognostic classification systems have allowed a risk-adapted treatment strategy in individual patients. Some high-risk MDS patient categories may benefit from intensive cytotoxic treatment. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT) from donors remains the treatment of choice for younger patients. Autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) may provide a suitable alternative for those patients without a sibling donor or for older patients' categories. New regimens using non-myeloablative stem cell transplantation followed by donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI) are underway and have achieved promising results in HLA-identical transplantation, resulting in reduced morbidity and mortality and confirming that this approach is feasible in patients ineligible for conventional allografting due to age and/or organ toxicity. Other therapeutic strategies include new low-dose treatments, antiapoptotic agents such as amifostine and anticytokine therapy, which are currently under investigation and deserve further evaluation. More insights into the biology of the disease, the discovery of new therapeutic approaches and the search for better ways to use existing strategies may lead to more effective treatments.","['Pisani, F D', 'Rainaldi, A']","['Pisani FD', 'Rainaldi A']","['Division of Hematology, San Raffaele Hospital and Polo Oncologico, Via Chianesi 53, 00144 Rome, Italy. fr.pisani@tiscalinet.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,Crit Rev Oncol Hematol,Critical reviews in oncology/hematology,8916049,,IM,,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Disease Management', 'Humans', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/etiology/pathology/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Assessment']",2001/12/12 10:00,2002/08/02 10:01,['2001/12/12 10:00'],"['2001/12/12 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/02 10:01 [medline]', '2001/12/12 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Crit Rev Oncol Hematol. 2001 Dec;40(3):215-28. doi: 10.1016/s1040-8428(01)00093-2.,,"['S1040842801000932 [pii]', '10.1016/s1040-8428(01)00093-2 [doi]']",,102,,,,,,,,,,

Mucoraceae may produce severe disease in susceptible individuals, notably patients with diabetes and leukemia. Rhinocerebral mucormycosis most commonly manifests itself in the setting of poorly controlled diabetes, especially with ketoacidosis. CASE PRESENTATION: A 31-year-old diabetic man presented to the outpatient clinic with the following signs and symptoms: headache, periorbital pain, swelling and loss of vision in the right eye. On physical examination his right eye was red and swollen. There was periorbital cellulitis and the conjunctiva was edematous. KOH preparation of purulent discharge showed broad, ribbonlike, aseptate hyphae when examined under a fluorescence microscope. Cranial MRI showed involvement of the right orbit, thrombosis in cavernous sinus and infiltrates at ethmoid and maxillary sinuses. Mucormycosis was diagnosed based on these findings. Amphotericin B (AmBisome(R); 2 mg/kg.d) was initiated after the test doses. Right orbitectomy and right partial maxillectomy were performed; the lesions in ethmoid and maxillary sinuses were removed. The duration of the liposomal amphotericin B therapy was approximately 6 months and the total dose of liposomal amphotericin B used was 32 grams. Liposomal amphotericin B therapy was stopped six months later and oral fluconazole was started. CONCLUSIONS: Although a total surgical debridement of the lesions could not be performed, it is remarkable that regression of the disease could be achieved with medical therapy alone.","['Cagatay, A A', 'Oncu, S S', 'Calangu, S S', 'Yildirmak, T T', 'Ozsut, H H', 'Eraksoy, H H']","['Cagatay AA', 'Oncu SS', 'Calangu SS', 'Yildirmak TT', 'Ozsut HH', 'Eraksoy HH']","['Department of Clinical Bacteriology and Infectious Diseases, Istanbul Faculty of Medicine, Istanbul University, Istanbul, Turkey. atayon@yahoo.com']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,BMC Infect Dis,BMC infectious diseases,100968551,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Drug Carriers)', '0 (Liposomes)', '7XU7A7DROE (Amphotericin B)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Amphotericin B/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Antifungal Agents/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Diabetes Complications', 'Drug Carriers', 'Humans', 'Liposomes', 'Male', 'Mucormycosis/*drug therapy/etiology', 'Treatment Outcome']",2001/12/12 10:00,2002/10/11 04:00,['2001/12/12 10:00'],"['2001/07/21 00:00 [received]', '2001/11/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2001/12/12 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/10/11 04:00 [medline]', '2001/12/12 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,BMC Infect Dis. 2001;1:22. doi: 10.1186/1471-2334-1-22.

The leukemic cells in an acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patient with a t(9;11)(p22;p15) were recently shown to have a fusion between the NUP98 gene and the LEDGF gene but it was not demonstrated that this fusion was recurrent in other leukaemia patients with the same translocation. RESULTS: We used RT-PCR to analyse the leukemic cells from an AML patient who presented with a cytogenetically identical translocation as the sole chromosomal abnormality. A NUP98-LEDGF fusion transcript was observed and confirmed by sequencing. The reciprocal transcript was also observed. The fusion transcript was not detectable during remission and recurred at relapse. The breakpoints in the NUP98 and LEDGF genes were different to those previously reported. The NUP98 breakpoint occurs in the intron between exons 8 and 9. It is the most 5' breakpoint reported in a translocation involving the NUP98 gene. All of the LEDGF gene is included in the fusion except for exon 1 which codes for the first 24 amino terminal amino acids.

An i.v. dosage form would eliminate this problem. Our objective was to compare the pharmacokinetics of 6MP administered orally with those of an i.v. dosage form 6-mercaptopurine riboside (6MPR), in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia or malignant lymphoma. METHODS: A total of 10 children were treated with oral 6MP, 50 mg/m(2) per day, while five children were treated with 6MPR, 50 mg/m(2) per day, administered by rapid i.v. injection. The plasma concentrations of 6MP and of 6MPR were measured on day 0, while the concentrations of 6-thioguanine nucleotides (6TGN) in red blood cells (RBC) were measured on day 2. The area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC1-5) was calculated from 1 to 5 h after drug administration. RESULTS: With the intravenously administered 6MPR, the AUC1-5 ranged from 124 to 186 (1.5-fold range, median 145) microM min; only two samples were obtained for the RBC concentration of 6TGN, and were 121 and 273 pmol per 25 mg hemoglobin. With the orally administered 6MP, the AUC1-5 ranged from 23 to 65 microM min (2.8-fold range, median 56); the RBC concentration of 6TGN ranged from 18 to 152 pmol per 25 mg hemoglobin (median 75). CONCLUSION: The i.v. administration of 6MPR showed less interindividual variation in the AUC1-5 coupled with a higher RBC level of 6TGN as compared with those by oral 6MP.

Recent advances in molecular biology, diagnostic criteria and classification of CLL have reinforced the concept of each category of CLL as a distinct entity. Since there have been no recent studies on the incidence and prevalence of CLL in Japan, the Kyushu Hematology Organization for Treatment (K-HOT) Study Group conducted two studies of CLL. One study is a prospective registration of newly diagnosed hematological disorders, which gave us some idea of the incidence of CLL in our region (Kyushu island) where adult T-cell leukemia is endemic. A total of 677 patients with hematological disorders were registered over a 6-month period and 11 patients were diagnosed as having CLL among 182 leukemia patients. This amounts to 6% of all leukemias, which is twice as frequent as previously reported in Japan. The other study is a retrospective analysis of CLL. Eleven institutions of the K-HOT Group analysed their diagnostic records of chronic lymphoid leukemia, and 145 patients with CLL were found over a period of 3-12 yr. After the data were reviewed 11 patients were excluded through having a different type of leukemia. The proportion of chronic B-cell lymphoid leukemia was 73% (98/134), while that of T-cell leukemia was 18% (24/134). The proportion of T-cell chronic leukemia was 5-6 times higher than that in Western countries. Two institutions had a complete database on hematological disorders. From this database, the annual incidence of CLL was estimated to be 0.48 per 100 000. Thus, the incidence of CLL in Japan is at least 4-5 times lower than that in Western countries, suggesting that chronic B-cell leukemia is really rare, but chronic leukemia of T-cell lineage develops in Japan as frequently as in Western societies. Further investigation is required to delineate why the incidence of B-CLL is so low in Japan.","['Tamura, K', 'Sawada, H', 'Izumi, Y', 'Fukuda, T', 'Utsunomiya, A', 'Ikeda, S', 'Uike, N', 'Tsukada, J', 'Kawano, F', 'Shibuya, T', 'Gondo, H', 'Okamura, S', 'Suzumiya, J']","['Tamura K', 'Sawada H', 'Izumi Y', 'Fukuda T', 'Utsunomiya A', 'Ikeda S', 'Uike N', 'Tsukada J', 'Kawano F', 'Shibuya T', 'Gondo H', 'Okamura S', 'Suzumiya J']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Fukuoka University Hospital, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,,IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Databases, Factual', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Japan/epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*epidemiology/pathology', 'Leukemia, Prolymphocytic, T-Cell/*epidemiology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",2001/12/12 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/12/12 10:00'],"['2001/12/12 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/12/12 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2001 Sep;67(3):152-7. doi: 10.1034/j.1600-0609.2001.5790514.x.,,"['514 [pii]', '10.1034/j.1600-0609.2001.5790514.x [doi]']",['Kyushu Hematology Organization for Treatment (K-HOT) Study Group'],,,,,,,,,,,

However, work on solid tumours has shown this strategy may be hampered, by an immune escape mechanism in which tumour secreted immunosuppressive factors compromise T and NK cell function. Indeed, acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) cells secrete immunosuppressive factors that block the synthesis of Th1 type cytokines in T cells. We demonstrate here that this immunosuppression, mediated by both HL60 AML cell line and primary AML blasts, inhibits T and NK cell proliferation but not cytolytic activity. Supernatants from HL60 cell line and primary AML blasts inhibited T cell proliferation to mitogenic and alloantigen stimulation but had no effect on cytolytic function. Similarly, the proliferation of NK cells to IL-2 and IL-15 stimulation was inhibited whilst their cytolytic function, shown by lysis of AML blasts, K562 and Daudi cells remained unaffected. The failure of T and NK cells to proliferate was not due to effector cell apoptosis. Indeed, removal of lymphocytes from the immunosuppressive environment partially restored their capacity to respond to mitogenic stimulation. T cells exposed to immunosuppressive supernatants did not increase expression of mitotic inhibitory proteins that arrest cell division, thereby ruling this out as a mechanism of operation for this immunosuppression. T cell expansion requires antigen stimulation, usually provided in the form of AML blasts, therefore our data suggest that NK cells may be more practical for the immunotherapy of AML.","['Orleans-Lindsay, J K', 'Barber, L D', 'Prentice, H G', 'Lowdell, M W']","['Orleans-Lindsay JK', 'Barber LD', 'Prentice HG', 'Lowdell MW']","['Department of Haematology, Royal Free University College Medical School, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Clin Exp Immunol,Clinical and experimental immunology,0057202,"['0 (Interleukin-15)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Isoantigens)', '0 (Mitogens)', '0 (Suppressor Factors, Immunologic)']",IM,,"['Cell Division', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/immunology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', '*Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Interleukin-15/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'Isoantigens/administration & dosage', 'K562 Cells', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*immunology/pathology/*therapy', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mitogens/pharmacology', 'Suppressor Factors, Immunologic/*metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/12/12 10:00,2002/01/24 10:01,['2001/12/12 10:00'],"['2001/12/12 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/24 10:01 [medline]', '2001/12/12 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Clin Exp Immunol. 2001 Dec;126(3):403-11. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2249.2001.01692.x.,,"['1692 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2249.2001.01692.x [doi]']",,,,,,,PMC1906225,,,,,

We exposed two B-cell lines to a range of S-nitroso-N-acetyl-D,L-penicillamine (SNAP) concentrations in order to examine their susceptibility to exogenous nitric oxide and the participation of nitric oxide as modulator of cell proliferation. Although both FLEB and NALM-6 decreased their levels of thymidine incorporation, only NALM-6 cells were induced to undergo G1 arrest, phosphatidyl serine exposure and DNA fragmentation when cultured in the presence of 250 microm SNAP. This higher sensitivity of NALM-6 coincided with initially low cyclin E protein levels which were increased 7.8-fold after culture for 24 h with 250 microm SNAP. In contrast, there was no difference in cyclins A and D3, Bcl-2 and actin levels, neither at the beginning nor at the end of the 24 h culture.

To prevent side-effects related to blood transfusion (e.g. anti-human leucocyte antigen immunization and transmission of infectious agents) leucocyte reduction of blood products is now systematically performed in various countries. The most common system used for leucoreduction is blood filtration. For further understanding of the mechanisms responsible for the interaction between leucocytes and the fibres present in filters we used a flow chamber to study the adhesion of leucocytes and leukaemic cell lines to different types of fibre. Adhesion was quantified using video-microscopy and computer image analysis. Our results demonstrate that adhesion to filter fibres was dependent on the expression of beta2-integrins CD11--CD18 and was inhibited by anti-CD18. The amount of fibres present, their spatial arrangement and the physicochemical characteristics of the fibres were important factors in leucocyte adhesion. Leucocyte adhesion was the highest to polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polyimide fibres. Lymphocytes or lymphocytic cell lines were poorly adherent to PET fibres.

We investigated whether MMPs and TIMPs are produced in long-term marrow cultures (LTMCs) established from normal donors and acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML) patients, and by fibroblast- (F), granulocyte macrophage- (GM) and megakaryocyte- (Meg) colony-forming unit (CFU) and erythroid burst-forming unit (BFU-E)-derived precursor cells. ProMMP-9 levels were highest (> 400 ng/ml) at week 1 of normal LTMC, whereas proMMP-2, TIMP-1, TIMP-2 and TIMP-3 levels peaked (up to 1000 ng/ml) after the establishment of the adherent layer. In LTMC from AML patients, these patterns of secretion were reversed. Moreover, we found that after a 24 h incubation in serum-free media, normal CFU-GM-, BFU-E- and CFU-Meg-derived cells secreted proMMP-9 and CFU-F-derived cells proMMP-2, in contrast to cells from LTMC adherent layer which secreted both active and latent forms of MMP-2 and MMP-9 under serum-free conditions. However, when these adherent cells were incubated in 12.5% fetal calf or horse serum or complete LTMC growth media, active forms of MMP-2 and MMP-9 were no longer detectable, and TIMP levels increased. Hence, we concluded that (i) MMPs/TIMPs are secreted by normal human bone marrow haematopoietic and stromal cells and may play an important role in intercellular cross-talk in haematopoiesis; and (ii) only latent forms of MMPs are present under LTMC conditions, indicating that the specific media used for weekly re-feeding of LTMC can block activation of MMP-2 and MMP-9, maintaining the integrity of the stromal layer and supporting haematopoiesis in vitro.","['Marquez-Curtis, L A', 'Dobrowsky, A', 'Montano, J', 'Turner, A R', 'Ratajczak, J', 'Ratajczak, M Z', 'Janowska-Wieczorek, A']","['Marquez-Curtis LA', 'Dobrowsky A', 'Montano J', 'Turner AR', 'Ratajczak J', 'Ratajczak MZ', 'Janowska-Wieczorek A']","['Canadian Blood Services, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase-1)', '0 (Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase-3)', '0 (Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinases)', '127497-59-0 (Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase-2)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (Matrix Metalloproteinases)', 'EC 3.4.24.24 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 2)', 'EC 3.4.24.35 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 9)']",IM,,"['Bone Marrow Cells/enzymology', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Division', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel/methods', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*enzymology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*enzymology', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 2/metabolism', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 9/metabolism', 'Matrix Metalloproteinases/*metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Time Factors', 'Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase-1/metabolism', 'Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase-2/metabolism', 'Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase-3/metabolism', 'Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinases/*metabolism/pharmacology']",2001/12/12 10:00,2002/01/10 10:01,['2001/12/12 10:00'],"['2001/12/12 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/10 10:01 [medline]', '2001/12/12 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2001 Dec;115(3):595-604. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2001.03160.x.,,"['3160 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2001.03160.x [doi]']",,,,,,['R01 HL061796-01/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,

Owing to fast degradation of RNA, the immediate processing of samples is thought to have a major influence on the reliability of results. Any delay caused by transport may be an obstacle to reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR)-based methods in multicentre studies. However, as air-dried bone marrow smears are usually available, we have improved a method to use smears as a source for routine RT-PCR investigations. We studied whether this source of RNA could overcome problems caused by delayed transport of samples. The aim of the present study was (i) to investigate the influence of a storage period of up to 4 d before processing of a specimen by nested bcr/abl RT-PCR, and (ii) to compare bone marrow aspirates with bone marrow smears stored at room temperature in parallel. Bone marrow aspirates and smears were taken from 11 patients with Ph-positive chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML). PCR results were semiquantified using a limiting dilution assay. We observed a loss of sensitivity < 1 log in stored bone marrow aspirates, even after 96 h. Results obtained from air-dried unstained glass slide smears were similar to investigations performed on approximately 1 x 10(5) cells of a bone marrow aspirate. We conclude that a storage period of up to 96 h has little influence on the detection of a bcr/abl fusion transcript in CML at diagnosis. Glass slide smears were equivalent to bone marrow aspirates in 8 out of 11 cases as a source for RT-PCR analysis when nested PCR was performed.","['Schoch, R', 'Pitako, J', 'Schafhausen, P', 'Jenisch, S', 'Haferlach, T', 'Kneba, M', 'Suttorp, M']","['Schoch R', 'Pitako J', 'Schafhausen P', 'Jenisch S', 'Haferlach T', 'Kneba M', 'Suttorp M']","['Department of Internal Medicine II, Christian-Albrechts-University of Kiel, Germany. r.schoch@med2.uni-kiel.de']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,,"['Bone Marrow Cells', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 22', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', '*Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', '*Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specimen Handling', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription, Genetic']",2001/12/12 10:00,2002/01/10 10:01,['2001/12/12 10:00'],"['2001/12/12 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/10 10:01 [medline]', '2001/12/12 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2001 Dec;115(3):583-7. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2001.03133.x.,,"['3133 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2001.03133.x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The median follow-up for all 103 patients was 8.4 years from transplant (range 5-17.6 years). In group A only one patient relapsed at 9.2 years. In group B eight patients (40%) relapsed: six at molecular, one at cytogenetic and one haematological levels. The actuarial probabilities of survival at 10 years for patients in Groups A, B and C were 97.4%, 92.9% and 100% respectively; the probabilities of relapse were 3%, 54% and 0% respectively.

We found that CFU-GM and BFU-E numbers per 105 mononuclear cells were similar in both AML PBPC and BM harvests; CFU-Mk numbers, however, were significantly higher in PBPC than BM. In addition, the higher total white cell count of the PBPC harvests meant that PBPC have much higher numbers of total progenitors per collection. CD61+ cell numbers in suspension cultures of AML PBPC and BM were lower than those of harvested normal marrow. However, response to pegylated recombinant human megakaryocyte growth and development factor (PEGrHuMGDF) both alone and in combination with other growth factors was qualitatively similar to that of normal BM. As with normal BM, response to PEGrHuMGDF alone did not increase further with addition of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), granulocyte-macrophage CSF (GM-CSF), interleukin 6 (IL-6) or erythropoietin (EPO) in the AML PBPC and BM. Further responses over PEGrHuMGDF alone were seen when added with stem cell factor (SCF) or with a combination of SCF + IL-3 + EPO in both AML PBPC and BM cultures; however, the magnitude of the response was greater in the PBPC cultures. Response to PEGrHuMGDF + IL-3 was seen in the PBPC cultures but not in the AML BM. These data suggest that, in AML patients, there are proportionally more megakaryocyte progenitor cells in the mobilized PBPC than in the BM harvests, which would explain the more rapid platelet recovery following PBPC autografts.","['Briggs, M', 'Adams, J A', 'Brereton, M L', 'Burgess, R', 'Hyde, K', 'Lenehan, H', 'Yin, J A']","['Briggs M', 'Adams JA', 'Brereton ML', 'Burgess R', 'Hyde K', 'Lenehan H', 'Yin JA']","['University Department of Haematology, Manchester Royal Infirmary, Manchester, UK.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CXCL12 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL12)', '0 (Chemokines, CXC)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Integrin beta3)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (polyethylene glycol-recombinant human megakaryocyte growth and development', 'factor)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '9014-42-0 (Thrombopoietin)']",IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Antigens, CD', 'Blood Platelets', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*cytology', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chemokine CXCL12', 'Chemokines, CXC/pharmacology', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/cytology', 'Erythropoietin/pharmacology', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Granulocytes/cytology', 'Growth Substances/*pharmacology', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Integrin beta3', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*blood', 'Macrophages/cytology', 'Megakaryocytes/*cytology/immunology', 'Middle Aged', 'Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Polyethylene Glycols/pharmacology', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Thrombopoietin/pharmacology']",2001/12/12 10:00,2002/01/10 10:01,['2001/12/12 10:00'],"['2001/12/12 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/10 10:01 [medline]', '2001/12/12 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2001 Dec;115(3):563-8. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2001.03162.x.,,"['3162 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2001.03162.x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Such extramedullary presentation is important for understanding the biology of childhood ALL and also for developing new prognostic parameters. A potential mechanism in the trafficking of leukaemia cells is the interaction of the chemokine receptor CXCR4, which is expressed on ALL cells, and its ligand stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1), produced by stromal cells in bone marrow and extramedullary organs. Functionality of CXCR4 was demonstrated by a high correlation between cell surface density of CXCR4 and transendothelial migration of leukaemia blasts towards a gradient of SDF-1 (r = 0.73, P = 0.001). Inhibition of SDF-1-induced migration by an anti-CXCR4 monoclonal antibody (78.33 +/- 23.86% inhibition) evidenced the specificity of CXCR4 to SDF-1. In order to evaluate clinical significance of CXCR4 expression, lymphoblasts from the bone marrow of 73 patients with and without extramedullary organ infiltration were compared. Multiparameter flow cytometry revealed that lymphoblasts from patients with high extramedullary organ infiltration, defined as ultrasonographically measured enlargement of liver or spleen, expressed the CXCR4 receptor at higher fluorescence intensity (median 66.12 +/- 66.17) than patients without extramedullary organ infiltration (median 17.56 +/- 19.29; P < 0.001). Consequently, high expression of CXCR4 was strongly predictive for extramedullary organ involvement, independently of the peripheral lymphoblast count. Highest CXCR4 expression was seen in mature B ALL (median 102.74 +/- 92.13; P < 0.003), a disease characterized by a high incidence of extramedullary bulky disease. As high expression of the chemokine receptor CXCR4 predicts extramedullary organ infiltration in childhood ALL, we suggest that CXCR4 and its ligand play an essential role in extramedullary invasion.","['Crazzolara, R', 'Kreczy, A', 'Mann, G', 'Heitger, A', 'Eibl, G', 'Fink, F M', 'Mohle, R', 'Meister, B']","['Crazzolara R', 'Kreczy A', 'Mann G', 'Heitger A', 'Eibl G', 'Fink FM', 'Mohle R', 'Meister B']","['Department of Paediatrics, University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (CXCL12 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL12)', '0 (Chemokines, CXC)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)']",IM,['Br J Haematol. 2002 Nov;119(2):579-80.

The aim of this study was to establish a population range for red blood cell (RBC) TPMT activity in children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) at disease diagnosis. An additional aim was to investigate factors that can influence TPMT activity within the RBC. METHODS: Blood samples were collected from children with ALL at disease diagnosis, prior to any blood transfusions, as part of the nationwide UK MRC ALL97 therapeutic trial. RBC TPMT activity was measured by h.p.l.c. RBCs were age-fractionated on Percoll density gradients. RESULTS: Pretreatment blood samples were received from 570 children within 3 days of venepuncture. TPMT activities at disease diagnosis ranged from 1.6 to 23.6 units/ml RBCs (median 7.9) compared with 0.654-18.8 units (median 12.9), in 111 healthy control children (median difference 4.5 units, 95% CI 3.9, 5.1 units, P < 0.001). A TPMT quality control sample, aliquots of which were assayed in 60 analytical runs over a 12 month period, contained a median of 11.98 units with a CV of 11.6%. Seven children had their RBCs age-fractionated on density gradients. TPMT activities in the top gradient (young cells) ranged from 4.2 to 14.1 units (median 7.5) and in the bottom gradient (old cells) 1.5-12.6 units (median 4.7 units), median difference 2.3 units, 95% CI 0.7, 4.1, P = 0.035. CONCLUSIONS: Circulating RBCs do not constitute a homogeneous population. They have a life span of around 120 days and during that time undergo a progressive ageing process. The anaemia of ALL is due to deficient RBC production. The results of this study indicate that RBC TPMT activities are significantly lower in children with ALL at disease diagnosis. This may be due, at least in part, to a relative excess of older RBCs.","['Lennard, L', 'Chew, T S', 'Lilleyman, J S']","['Lennard L', 'Chew TS', 'Lilleyman JS']","['University of Sheffield Division of Clinical Sciences, Section of Medicine and Pharmacology, Royal Hallamshire Hospital, Sheffield S10 2JF, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Clin Pharmacol,British journal of clinical pharmacology,7503323,"['EC 2.1.1.- (Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.67 (thiopurine methyltransferase)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Cellular Senescence', 'Child', 'Enzyme Stability', 'Erythrocytes/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Methyltransferases/*blood', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*enzymology']",2001/12/12 10:00,2002/03/07 10:01,['2001/12/12 10:00'],"['2001/12/12 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/07 10:01 [medline]', '2001/12/12 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Clin Pharmacol. 2001 Nov;52(5):539-46. doi: 10.1046/j.0306-5251.2001.01497.x.,,"['1497 [pii]', '10.1046/j.0306-5251.2001.01497.x [doi]']",,,,,,,PMC2014613,,,,,

We have developed an analytical method using a polyacrylamide-agarose composite gel to evaluate ribosomal subunits in apoptotic cells (human breast carcinoma MCF-7 cells treated with staurosporine and human 293T cells irradiated with ultraviolet light were used in addition to the two apoptosis systems described above). No alterations were detected by this method, suggesting that apoptosis, including the process of ribosomal RNA degradation, does not cause fragmentation or extensive conformational changes in the ribosome. We also examined the status of 21 different ribosomal proteins in apoptotic cells by immunoblotting with polyclonal antibodies. S11 was specifically downregulated in apoptotic MCF-7 cells and in other apoptotic breast carcinoma cells. Previous studies have shown that S11 is heterogeneously expressed in cancer cells. Taken together, it appears that particular intracellular environments regulate the expression of S11 protein. However, the mechanism by which this process is modulated is as yet unknown. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that our composite gel electrophoresis system can efficiently detect ubiquitination of ribosomal subunits.","['Nadano, D', 'Aoki, C', 'Yoshinaka, T', 'Irie, S', 'Sato, T A']","['Nadano D', 'Aoki C', 'Yoshinaka T', 'Irie S', 'Sato TA']","['Molecular Oncology Laboratory, RIKEN (Institute of Physical and Chemical Research), Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-0074, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,"['0 (Ribosomal Proteins)', '0 (Ubiquitin)', '0 (ribosomal protein S11)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)']",IM,,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Electrophoresis, Agar Gel', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Ribosomal Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Ribosomes/drug effects/metabolism', 'Staurosporine/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'U937 Cells', 'Ubiquitin/metabolism']",2001/12/12 10:00,2002/01/31 10:01,['2001/12/12 10:00'],"['2001/12/12 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/31 10:01 [medline]', '2001/12/12 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochemistry. 2001 Dec 18;40(50):15184-93. doi: 10.1021/bi0108397.,,"['bi0108397 [pii]', '10.1021/bi0108397 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Inorganic arsenic, especially arsenic trioxide, has been demonstrated to induce clinical remission in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia as well as those with several solid cancers. So, in this study, we examined the in vitro effect of realgar(As2S2), used to treat human diseases for centuries in traditional Chinese medicine, on cell survival and apoptosis in a human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) line: ECV-304. Four different suspensions of realgar particles with diameters from 100-500 nm containing equivalent doses were investigated to determine their size effects. After 2, 4, 6 and 8 h, realgar particles of diameters 100 nm and 150 nm obviously reduced ECV-304 cell survival, which was evidenced by a reduction of cell viability in the MTT assay, whereas cells exhibited slight viability reduction in response to treatment with realgar particles of diameters 200 nm and 500 nm. Significant apoptosis was identified by morphological observation, flow cytometry assay and DNA gel electrophoresis in the ECV-304 cells by the presence of realgar particles of diameters 100 nm and 150 nm. It is demonstrated that particles of realgar with average diameters from 100 nm to 150 nm can induce ECV-304 cell apoptosis. These results suggest that particles of realgar smaller than 150 nm may provide a less toxic agent for anti-neoplasia by suppressing angiogenesis.","['Deng, Y', 'Xu, H', 'Huang, K', 'Yang, X', 'Xie, C', 'Wu, J']","['Deng Y', 'Xu H', 'Huang K', 'Yang X', 'Xie C', 'Wu J']","['Department of Chemistry, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430074, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Pharmacol Res,Pharmacological research,8907422,"['0 (Angiogenesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Formazans)', '0 (Indicators and Reagents)', '0 (Sulfides)', '0 (Tetrazolium Salts)', '23305-68-2 (MTT formazan)', '56320-22-0 (arsenic disulfide)', 'F30N4O6XVV (Acridine Orange)']",IM,,"['Acridine Orange', 'Angiogenesis Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Electrophoresis, Agar Gel', 'Endothelium, Vascular/cytology/drug effects', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'Formazans', 'Humans', 'Indicators and Reagents', 'Particle Size', 'Sulfides/*pharmacology', 'Tetrazolium Salts', 'Umbilical Veins']",2001/12/12 10:00,2002/04/16 10:01,['2001/12/12 10:00'],"['2001/12/12 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/04/16 10:01 [medline]', '2001/12/12 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Pharmacol Res. 2001 Dec;44(6):513-8. doi: 10.1006/phrs.2001.0885.,,"['10.1006/phrs.2001.0885 [doi]', 'S1043-6618(01)90885-0 [pii]']",,,,['Copyright 2001 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,,

Clinically, ET is characterized by vasomotor symptoms, thrombohemorrhagic complications, recurrent fetal loss, and transformation of the disease into either myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia or acute myeloid leukemia. Median survival in the majority of patients is close to that of an age-adjusted normal population, and current therapy has not been shown to either retard or hasten leukemic transformation, which is reported to occur in 1% to 20% of patients. The use of hydroxyurea in high-risk patients with ET has reduced the incidence of thrombosis, and recent studies have suggested the value of keeping the platelet count below 400 x 10(9)/L in such cases. The incidence of thrombosis in low-risk patients may not be high enough to warrant the use of cytoreductive therapy. Although effective in controlling vasomotor symptoms, aspirin therapy has not been shown to influence the risk of either recurrent thrombosis or first-trimester miscarriage in ET. Recent laboratory studies have suggested that hematopoiesis in ET may not always be clonal. Similarly, there is substantial heterogeneity in both megakaryocyte/platelet surface expression of the thrombopoietin receptor (c-Mpl) and bone marrow microvessel density. Clinicopathologic correlates to these biologic parameters are currently being defined.","['Tefferi, A', 'Murphy, S']","['Tefferi A', 'Murphy S']","['Division of Hematology and Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905, USA. tefferi.ayalew@mayo.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Blood Rev,Blood reviews,8708558,,IM,,"['Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Disease Management', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications, Hematologic', '*Thrombocythemia, Essential/diagnosis/etiology/therapy', 'Thrombosis/drug therapy/etiology/prevention & control']",2001/12/12 10:00,2002/08/01 10:01,['2001/12/12 10:00'],"['2001/12/12 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/01 10:01 [medline]', '2001/12/12 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood Rev. 2001 Sep;15(3):121-31. doi: 10.1054/blre.2001.0158.,,"['10.1054/blre.2001.0158 [doi]', 'S0268-960X(01)90158-4 [pii]']",,166,,['Copyright 2001 Harcourt Publishers Ltd.'],,,,,,,,

Because virtually all patients in need of a hematopoietic stem cell transplant have a full-haplotype mismatched donor, who is immediately available, a T-cell depleted mismatched transplant should be offered, not as a last resort, but as a viable option to high risk acute leukemia patients who do not have, or cannot find, a matched donor.","['Aversa, F', 'Velardi, A', 'Tabilio, A', 'Reisner, Y', 'Martelli, M F']","['Aversa F', 'Velardi A', 'Tabilio A', 'Reisner Y', 'Martelli MF']","['Hematopoietic Stem Cell Program, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Section of Hematology and Clinical Immunology, University of Perugia, Perugia, 06100, Italy. aversa@unipg.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Blood Rev,Blood reviews,8708558,,IM,,"['Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Haplotypes/*immunology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods/mortality', 'Histocompatibility/immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/mortality/*therapy', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation, Homologous/methods/mortality']",2001/12/12 10:00,2002/08/01 10:01,['2001/12/12 10:00'],"['2001/12/12 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/01 10:01 [medline]', '2001/12/12 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood Rev. 2001 Sep;15(3):111-9. doi: 10.1054/blre.2001.0157.,,"['10.1054/blre.2001.0157 [doi]', 'S0268-960X(01)90157-2 [pii]']",,59,,['Copyright 2001 Harcourt Publishers Ltd.'],,,,,,,,

A total of 1242 people entered the study, including 558 children with cancer, 193 relatives of infected children, 302 health care workers and 189 controls. METHODS: To stop dual HBV and HCV nosocomial infection in the oncology department, a preventive strategy was introduced. It involved immunoprophylaxis against HBV, screening blood donors for HCV infection, intensification of nonspecific prophylaxis, an educational program and estimation of risk for relatives of infected children and health care personnel. RESULTS: Retrospective analysis showed that the prevalence of HBV and HCV infections in children with cancer was 74 of 119 (62.2%) and 50 of 92 (54.3%), respectively, with the highest rate among patients with leukemia. Inferior anticancer therapeutic response were obtained in infected children. Specific anti-HBV immunoprophylaxis introduced simultaneously with anticancer therapy resulted in protection of 160 of 168 (95.2%) children in the first 4 years, when 62.9% of patients receiving therapy developed protective antibodies. Screening of blood donors and intensification of nonspecific prophylaxis reduced HCV prevalence to 2.8% during the most recent 1.5 years. Genotype analysis showed that the risk of HCV infection was 0.5% for relatives of infected children. The risk for health care personnel was 0 in the oncology ward and 1.9% in the other departments, and it reached 0.53% in control group. CONCLUSIONS: The preventive strategy of viral hepatitis in children with cancer, including passive-active HBV immunoprophylaxis from the beginning of chemotherapy and intensive nonspecific prophylactic measures is effective. With this strategy the risk of intrafamily and occupational infection is low.","['Styczynski, J', 'Wysocki, M', 'Koltan, S', 'Kurylak, A']","['Styczynski J', 'Wysocki M', 'Koltan S', 'Kurylak A']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Medical University, Bydgoszcz, Poland. jan_styczynski@kki.net.pl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Pediatr Infect Dis J,The Pediatric infectious disease journal,8701858,,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Blood Donors', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cross Infection/epidemiology/*prevention & control/transmission', 'Family Health', 'Female', 'Hepatitis B/epidemiology/*prevention & control/transmission', 'Hepatitis C/epidemiology/*prevention & control/transmission', 'Humans', 'Immunization', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Infant', 'Infectious Disease Transmission, Patient-to-Professional/prevention & control', 'Male', 'Mass Screening', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*complications/therapy', 'Poland/epidemiology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Seroepidemiologic Studies']",2001/12/06 10:00,2002/04/17 10:01,['2001/12/06 10:00'],"['2001/12/06 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/04/17 10:01 [medline]', '2001/12/06 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Pediatr Infect Dis J. 2001 Nov;20(11):1042-9. doi: 10.1097/00006454-200111000-00008.,,['10.1097/00006454-200111000-00008 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

We have explored a role for LMO4, initially described as a human breast tumor autoantigen, in developing mammary epithelium and breast oncogenesis. Lmo4 was expressed predominantly in the lobuloalveoli of the mammary gland during pregnancy. Consistent with a role in proliferation, forced expression of this gene inhibited differentiation of mammary epithelial cells. Overexpression of LMO4 mRNA was observed in 5 of 10 human breast cancer cell lines. Moreover, in situ hybridization analysis of 177 primary invasive breast carcinomas revealed overexpression of LMO4 in 56% of specimens. Immunohistochemistry confirmed overexpression in a high percentage (62%) of tumors. These studies imply a role for LMO4 in maintaining proliferation of mammary epithelium and suggest that deregulation of this gene may contribute to breast tumorigenesis.","['Visvader, J E', 'Venter, D', 'Hahm, K', 'Santamaria, M', 'Sum, E Y', ""O'Reilly, L"", 'White, D', 'Williams, R', 'Armes, J', 'Lindeman, G J']","['Visvader JE', 'Venter D', 'Hahm K', 'Santamaria M', 'Sum EY', ""O'Reilly L"", 'White D', 'Williams R', 'Armes J', 'Lindeman GJ']","['The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research and Bone Marrow Research Laboratories, Melbourne, Victoria 3050, Australia. visvader@wehi.edu.au']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Caseins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (LDB1 protein, human)', '0 (LIM Domain Proteins)', '0 (LMO4 protein, human)', '0 (Ldb1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Lmo4 protein, mouse)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Animals', 'Breast Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Caseins/biosynthesis', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Epithelial Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'LIM Domain Proteins', 'Mammary Glands, Animal/*cytology/growth & development/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Pregnancy', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/12/06 10:00,2002/01/11 10:01,['2001/12/06 10:00'],"['2001/12/06 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/11 10:01 [medline]', '2001/12/06 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2001 Dec 4;98(25):14452-7. doi: 10.1073/pnas.251547698.,,"['10.1073/pnas.251547698 [doi]', '98/25/14452 [pii]']",,,,,,,PMC64702,,,,,

The disease has a high mortality rate and is resistant to chemotherapy; therefore, immunologic approaches to treatment could be of interest. We have previously shown that athymic rats inoculated with a syngeneic (i.e., with the same genetic background) HTLV-I-infected T-cell line (FPM1-V1AX) develop ATL-like disease and that the transfer of T cells from normal syngeneic rats immunized with FPM1-V1AX cells prevents disease development. In this study, we further characterized the host antitumor immunity to explore the possibility of peptide-based vaccination against the ATL-like disease. METHODS: Immune T cells from rats immunized with FPM1-V1AX cells were analyzed for their phenotypes and cytotoxic properties. The epitope recognized by the T cells was analyzed by fine mapping. To evaluate the antitumor effects of a peptide-based vaccine, normal rats were immunized with synthetic oligopeptides corresponding to the epitope, the T cells were transferred to athymic rats inoculated with HTLV-I infected cells, and tumor size was monitored. RESULTS: Both CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell populations from rats immunized with FPM1-V1AX cells inhibited the growth of FPM1-V1AX cell-induced lymphomas in vivo. Long-term culture of splenic T cells from the immunized rats repeatedly resulted in establishment of CD8+ HTLV-I-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) lines restricted to the rat major histocompatibility complex class I molecule, RT1.A(l). The cytotoxicity of these lines was directed against the HTLV-I regulatory protein Tax and, specifically, against the epitope, amino acids 180-188 (GAFLTNVPY). Adoptive transfer of the Tax 180-188-specific CTL line or freshly prepared T cells from rats vaccinated with the Tax 180-188 oligopeptide prevented the development of FPM1-V1AX-cell induced lymphomas in athymic rats in comparison with control groups (two rats in each group). CONCLUSIONS: This study indicated a potential therapeutic effect of peptide-based vaccination against HTLV-I-induced lymphoproliferative disease.","['Hanabuchi, S', 'Ohashi, T', 'Koya, Y', 'Kato, H', 'Hasegawa, A', 'Takemura, F', 'Masuda, T', 'Kannagi, M']","['Hanabuchi S', 'Ohashi T', 'Koya Y', 'Kato H', 'Hasegawa A', 'Takemura F', 'Masuda T', 'Kannagi M']","['Department of Immunotherapeutics, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Medical Research Division, 1-5-45 Yushima, Bunkyo-Ku, Tokyo 113-8519, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,"['0 (Amino Acids)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Cancer Vaccines)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Vaccines, Subunit)']",IM,,"['Amino Acids/chemistry', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/metabolism', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Cancer Vaccines', 'Cell Line', 'Epitope Mapping', 'Epitopes/chemistry', 'Female', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Lymphoma/prevention & control/*therapy/*virology', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/prevention & control/virology', 'Major Histocompatibility Complex', 'Mice', 'Peptides/*chemistry/pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred F344', 'Rats, Nude', 'T-Lymphocytes', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines, Subunit/chemistry', 'Vaccinia virus/metabolism']",2001/12/06 10:00,2002/01/10 10:01,['2001/12/06 10:00'],"['2001/12/06 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/10 10:01 [medline]', '2001/12/06 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 2001 Dec 5;93(23):1775-83. doi: 10.1093/jnci/93.23.1775.,,['10.1093/jnci/93.23.1775 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The neutrophils in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) exhibit defects in several functions. As a step towards understanding the role of PKC in the defects in function of the leukemic cells, this study investigates the expression of PKC isoforms, their subcellular distribution, levels and kinase activity in the normal and leukemic neutrophils. It also investigates changes in representative PKC isoforms during myeloid maturation. This study confirms the presence of PKC alpha, beta and delta and shows, for the first time, the presence of non conventional PKC isoform theta, atypical PKC isoform lambda/iota and PKC isoform mu in normal human neutrophils. In unstimulated cells all the detected PKC isoforms showed a predominantly cytosolic localisation in normal and CML neutrophils. Cytosol-membrane distribution of PKC alpha and delta were significantly altered in leukemic neutrophils as compared to normal cells. Cytosolic levels of all PKC isoforms were reduced in CML neutrophils with PKC alpha, beta, iota, theta, and mu showing a significant decrease. Cytosolic levels of PKC delta contrary to the trend observed for other PKC isoforms showed a slight increase in CML cells, while its membrane levels were significantly reduced in CML neutrophils. Total PKC kinase activity in CML neutrophil cytosol was significantly reduced, while specific kinase activity of two representative isoforms, PKC alpha and delta, from normal and CML neutrophils were similar, thereby increasing the significance of the altered levels of PKC isoforms in CML, and highlighting their role in the defects in function exhibited by the leukemic neutrophils. The levels of PKC delta and iota increased and decreased respectively as the leukemic myeloid cell matured from the blast to the neutrophil, while the levels of PKC alpha and beta were not altered. This suggests a role for PKC delta and iota in the maturation of the leukemic myeloid cell.","['Balasubramanian, Nagaraj', 'Advani, Suresh H', 'Zingde, Surekha M']","['Balasubramanian N', 'Advani SH', 'Zingde SM']","['Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Division, Cancer Research Institute, Parel, 400012, Mumbai, India.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Isoenzymes)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)']",IM,,"['Cell Fractionation', 'Cytosol/metabolism', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Membranes/metabolism', 'Isoenzymes/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*enzymology/pathology', 'Neutrophils/*enzymology/pathology', 'Protein Kinase C/*metabolism']",2001/12/06 10:00,2002/02/20 10:01,['2001/12/06 10:00'],"['2001/12/06 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/20 10:01 [medline]', '2001/12/06 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2002 Jan;26(1):67-81. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(01)00098-4.,,"['S0145212601000984 [pii]', '10.1016/s0145-2126(01)00098-4 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the signaling mechanisms that mediate drug-induced apoptosis are still widely unknown. Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling cascades trigger stimulus-specific responses in cells with ERK being associated with proliferation and differentiation, and JNK/SAPK and p38 mediating stress and apoptotic responses. Here, we found that mitoxantrone and anisomycin stimulated a dose- and time-dependent induction of JNK/SAPK activity, and to a lesser extent p38 activity, that preceded the appearance of apoptosis as measured by internucleosomal DNA fragmentation. These compounds did not induce ERK activity. We further demonstrated that p38 activity was not involved in the induction of apoptosis since the use of the p38 inhibitor, SB203580, did not prevent drug-induced apoptotic DNA fragmentation. Additionally, direct inhibition of JNK/SAPK signaling through the use of dominant-negative MKK4/SEK1 (SEK-AL) inhibited mitoxantrone- and anisomycin-induced apoptosis.

However, recent reports have clarified that early growth response 1 gene (Egr1) positively regulates MDR1 transcription, while Wilms' tumor suppressor gene (WT1) does negative regulation of MDR1 gene expression in 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate treated K562 cells. In addition, Egr1 and WT1 are structurally related transcription factors and bind to quite similar DNA sequences. Our study of mRNA expression profile of Egr1, WT1 and MDR1 in fresh AML samples demonstrated that there are disease-specific patterns. Egr1 mRNA was frequently and strongly expressed in monocytic leukemia cells, especially in AML M4 cells. WT1 mRNA was undetectable in t(8;21) AML cells. mRNA expression of MDR1 was frequent in AML M1 and t(8;21) AML cells, in which the expression level was highest in AML M1 and was low in monocytic leukemia (M4 and M5). Then, expression level of MDR1 was inversely correlated with Egr1. By liquid culture of leukemia cell lines and fresh AML cells with the addition of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), modulation of P-gp/MDR1 and Egr1 was observed and the pattern of modulation was divided into four groups: (1) blastic AML type, in which distinct expression of P-gp/MDR1 and CD34 was not influenced by ATRA; (2) t(8;21)AML type, in which P-gp/MDR1 expression was augmented by ATRA, while CD34 was kept high; (3) AML M3 type, in which P-gp/MDR1 expression was reduced with granulocytic differentiation by ATRA; (4) monocytic AML type, in which P-gp/MDR1 expression was augmented by ATRA, while CD34 expression decreased, and strong Egr1 expression was downregulated just prior to the augmentation of P-gp/MDR1 expression. WT1 expression was not influenced by the addition of ATRA in each group. Previous reports have suggested that P-gp/MDR1 plays an important role in resistance to chemotherapy, and is recognized as one of the stem cell marker. However, P-gp/MDR1 expression augmented by ATRA, which was observed in monocytic AML, was recognized as a functional molecule of mature monocyte/macrophage, because CD34 expression decreased and CD13 expression increased by ATRA. Finally, expression of P-gp/MDR1 in monocytic leukemia, which was functionally confirmed by Rh123 efflux study, was thought to be closely related to the characteristic modulation of Egr1 expression by ATRA.","['Tokura, Yoshifumi', 'Shikami, Masato', 'Miwa, Hiroshi', 'Watarai, Masaya', 'Sugamura, Kazutaka', 'Wakabayashi, Motohiro', 'Satoh, Atsushi', 'Imamura, Akira', 'Mihara, Hidetsugu', 'Katoh, Yoshiro', 'Kita, Kenkichi', 'Nitta, Masakazu']","['Tokura Y', 'Shikami M', 'Miwa H', 'Watarai M', 'Sugamura K', 'Wakabayashi M', 'Satoh A', 'Imamura A', 'Mihara H', 'Katoh Y', 'Kita K', 'Nitta M']","['The Second Department of Internal Medicine, Aichi Medical University School of Medicine, Nagakute, 480-1195, Aichi, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (EGR1 protein, human)', '0 (Early Growth Response Protein 1)', '0 (Immediate-Early Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 3.4.11.2 (CD13 Antigens)']",IM,,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*genetics/metabolism', 'Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'CD13 Antigens/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Separation', 'DNA Primers/chemistry', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Early Growth Response Protein 1', 'Humans', '*Immediate-Early Proteins', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*metabolism', 'Monocytes/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism', 'WT1 Proteins/genetics/metabolism']",2001/12/06 10:00,2002/02/20 10:01,['2001/12/06 10:00'],"['2001/12/06 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/20 10:01 [medline]', '2001/12/06 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2002 Jan;26(1):29-36. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(01)00094-7.,,"['S0145212601000947 [pii]', '10.1016/s0145-2126(01)00094-7 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Immunophenotyping showed BCP type III pre-B cell characteristics including TdT, CD10, CD19, CD22, CD79a and HLA class II. T cell and myeloid-associated antigens tested were negative except CD5 which was 100% positive for both cell lines. The surrogate light chains lambda5 and VpreB were positive for both cell lines. Cytogenetic analysis of NALM-36 revealed an abnormal karyotype with 46, XX, add(1)(q?42), -14, +mar. Southern blot analysis of the immunoglobulin (Ig) genes status of NALM-36 at 10 months after establishment showed germ line configuration of the kappa light chain gene, and rearrangement of the lambda light and mu heavy chain genes. At 16 months we detected a phenotypic shift of Ig chain protein expression from a BCP-III pre-B cell phenotype to a BCP-IV mature B cell phenotype, with kappa and lambda double Ig light chain and mu heavy chain expression, both on the cell surface and in the cytoplasm. We designated this subline as NALM-36KL. Authenticity of the NALM-36KL, NALM-36 and NALM-37 cell lines was demonstrated by DNA fingerprinting. The extensive characterization of the sister cell lines suggests that these three novel cell lines, derived from a single patient, may represent unique and relevant in vitro model systems for BCP-type leukemia cells.

RESULTS: RNase H-active, chimeric methylphosphonodiester / phosphodiester antisense oligodeoxynucleotides targeting bases 1147-1166 of c-myc mRNA downregulated c-Myc protein and induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest respectively in cultures of MOLT-4 and KYO1 human leukemia cells. In contrast, an RNase H-inactive, morpholino antisense oligonucleotide analogue 28-mer, simultaneously targeting the exon 2 splice acceptor site and initiation codon, reduced c-Myc protein to barely detectable levels but did not affect cell proliferation in these or other leukemia lines. The RNase H-active oligodeoxynucleotide 20-mers contained the phosphodiester linked motif CGTTG, which as an apoptosis inducing CpG oligodeoxynucleotide 5-mer of sequence type CGNNN (N = A, G, C, or T) had potent activity against MOLT-4 cells. The 5-mer mimicked the antiproliferative effects of the 20-mer in the absence of any antisense activity against c-myc mRNA, while the latter still reduced expression of c-myc in a subline of MOLT-4 cells that had been selected for resistance to CGTTA, but in this case the oligodeoxynucleotide failed to induce apoptosis or cell cycle arrest. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the biological activity of the chimeric c-myc antisense 20-mers resulted from a non-antisense mechanism related to the CGTTG motif contained within the sequence, and not through downregulation of c-myc. Although the oncogene may have been implicated in the etiology of the original leukemias, expression of c-myc is apparently no longer required to sustain continuous cell proliferation in these culture lines.","['Tidd, D M', 'Giles, R V', 'Broughton, C M', 'Clark, R E']","['Tidd DM', 'Giles RV', 'Broughton CM', 'Clark RE']","['School of Biological Sciences, The University of Liverpool, Liverpool, UK. dmtidd@liv.ac.uk']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,BMC Mol Biol,BMC molecular biology,100966983,,,,,2001/12/06 10:00,2001/12/06 10:01,['2001/12/06 10:00'],"['2001/09/26 00:00 [received]', '2001/11/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2001/12/06 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/12/06 10:01 [medline]', '2001/12/06 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,BMC Mol Biol. 2001 Nov 16;2:13. doi: 10.1186/1471-2199-2-13.

To further investigate the phenotype of CLLs, their cellular derivation and their relationship to normal B cells, we have analyzed their gene expression profiles using oligonucleotide-based DNA chip microarrays representative of approximately 12,000 genes. The results show that CLLs display a common and characteristic gene expression profile that is largely independent of their IgV genotype. Nevertheless, a restricted number of genes (<30) have been identified whose differential expression can distinguish IgV mutated versus unmutated cases and identify them in independent panels of cases. Comparison of CLL profiles with those of purified normal B cell subpopulations indicates that the common CLL profile is more related to memory B cells than to those derived from naive B cells, CD5(+) B cells, and GC centroblasts and centrocytes.

Its mode of action involves two distinct mechanisms: one in which a nonspecific binding occurs to DNA ends and a second that involves a specific binding to negative regulatory elements involved in transcription repression. Such elements were identified in mouse mammary tumor virus and human T cell leukemia virus retroviruses. The purpose of this study was to investigate a role for Ku in the regulation of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 transcription. First, HIV-1 LTR activity was studied in CHO-K1 cells and in CH0-derived xrs-6 cells, which are devoid of Ku80. LTR-driven expression of a reporter gene was significantly increased in xrs-6 cells. This enhancement was suppressed after re-expression of Ku80. Second, transcription of HIV-1 was followed in U1 human cells that were depleted in Ku by using a Ku80 antisense RNA. Ku depletion led to a increase of both HIV-1 mRNA synthesis and viral production compared with the parent cells. These results demonstrate that Ku acts as a transcriptional repressor of HIV-1 expression.

To investigate an association between MLL (mixed lineage leukemia or myeloid-lymphoid leukemia) rearrangement and granulocytic sarcoma, we applied fluorescence in situ hybridization for detection of the 11q23/MLL rearrangements on the bone marrow cells of 40 patients with childhood acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). Nine (22.5%) of 40 patients exhibited MLL rearrangements. Three (33.3%) of these nine patients had granulocytic sarcoma and were younger than 12 months of age. Of these three patients one presented as granulocytic sarcoma of both testes with cerebrospinal fluid involvement, the second case presented in the form of an abdominal mass, and the third as a periorbital granulocytic sarcoma. On the other hand, no granulocytic sarcomas were found among MLL-negative patients. It is likely that MLL-positive infant AML may predispose granulocytic sarcoma. Regarding the findings of our study and those of other reports, we would guess that the incidence of granulocytic sarcoma in pediatric MLL-positive AML may be equal to or greater than the 18 to 24% described in AML with t(8;21). Further investigations designed to identify 11q23/MLL abnormalities of leukemic cells or extramedullary tumor may be helpful for the precise diagnosis of granulocytic sarcoma.","['Park, K U', 'Lee, D S', 'Lee, H S', 'Kim, C J', 'Cho, H I']","['Park KU', 'Lee DS', 'Lee HS', 'Kim CJ', 'Cho HI']","['Department of Clinical Pathology, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Pathol,The American journal of pathology,0370502,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Sarcoma, Myeloid/*genetics/pathology', '*Transcription Factors']",2001/12/06 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/12/06 10:00'],"['2001/12/06 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/12/06 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Pathol. 2001 Dec;159(6):2011-6. doi: 10.1016/S0002-9440(10)63052-0.,,"['S0002-9440(10)63052-0 [pii]', '10.1016/S0002-9440(10)63052-0 [doi]']",,,,,,,PMC1850598,,,,,

DESIGN: Retrospective noncomparative interventional case series. PARTICIPANTS: Six patients recently seen at University of California San Francisco with retinal infiltrates in a setting of leukemia, for which adequate written and photographic information of disease course was available. INTERVENTION: Observation consisted of retrospective review of clinic charts, hospital medical records, and fundus photographs. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Determination of whether retinal infiltrates represented neoplasia or infection was made by review of medical records. RESULTS: In this series, neoplastic retinal infiltrates were found in patients who had newly diagnosed leukemia and those who were in blast crisis. In contrast, the two patients who were in complete remission, but had undergone bone marrow transplantation, had retinal infiltrates attributable to infection. CONCLUSIONS: Every patient with retinal infiltrates in the setting of newly or previously diagnosed leukemia requires a systemic and central nervous system workup before the initiation of ophthalmologic treatment. The systemic status of the patient is highly informative in determining whether infection or neoplasia is responsible for the infiltration.","['Gordon, K B', 'Rugo, H S', 'Duncan, J L', 'Irvine, A R', 'Howes, E L Jr', ""O'Brien, J M"", 'Carter, S R']","['Gordon KB', 'Rugo HS', 'Duncan JL', 'Irvine AR', 'Howes EL Jr', ""O'Brien JM"", 'Carter SR']","['Department of Ophthalmology, University of California San Francisco, 10 Koret Way, San Francisco, CA 94143-0730, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Ophthalmology,Ophthalmology,7802443,,IM,,"['Adult', 'Child', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*pathology/therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology/therapy', 'Leukemic Infiltration/*pathology/therapy', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*pathology/therapy', 'Retina/*pathology', 'Retinal Diseases/diagnosis', 'Retrospective Studies']",2001/12/26 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/12/26 10:00'],"['2001/12/26 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/12/26 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ophthalmology. 2001 Dec;108(12):2293-300. doi: 10.1016/s0161-6420(01)00817-x.,,"['S0161-6420(01)00817-X [pii]', '10.1016/s0161-6420(01)00817-x [doi]']",,,,,,['EY 02162/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,

G-CSF was used as priming agent and was initiated at least 4 weeks after the last day of chemotherapy, while neutrophil count was >0.5 x 10(9)/l and platelet count was >30 x 10(9)/l. A median of three aphereses was performed resulting in a median collection of 14.8 x 10(8) nucleated cells/kg containing 7.7 x 10(8) mononuclear cells/kg, 47.1 x 10(4) CFU-GM/kg, and 3.8 x 10(6) CD34+ cells/kg. A significant correlation was observed between nucleated cell, mononuclear cell, and CFU-GM yields, while no correlation was found with CD34+ cell yield. Recruitment was not significantly different in patients with CD34+ leukemic cells at the time of initial diagnosis when compared to that of those presenting with CD34- blastic cells. Thirty-three patients actually underwent transplantation. Reasons for not autografting were inadequate stem cell harvest (ten patients), early relapse (two patients), prolonged neutropenia (one patient), organ failure (two patients), or patient refusal (one patient). Median time to achieve a neutrophil count greater than 0.5 x 10(9)/l and platelet count >50 x 10(9)/l untransfused was 13 and 36 days, respectively. A predictive factor for a shorter period neutropenia and a shorter thrombopenia was a higher count of harvested nucleated cells (p < 0.01 and p = 0.02, respectively). A higher count of harvested cells was also a predictive factor for less red cell and platelet transfusions (p=0.03 and p=0.02, respectively). The number of CD34+ harvested PBSC was not predictive for engraftment. We conclude that PBSC mobilization with G-CSF alone initiated in steady state is a feasible, safe, and suitable procedure for harvesting cells in sight of autologous transplantation in adult acute myeloid leukemia.","['Voog, E', 'Le, Q H', 'Philip, I', 'Benetaib, B', 'Michallet, M', 'Fiere, D', 'Thomas, X']","['Voog E', 'Le QH', 'Philip I', 'Benetaib B', 'Michallet M', 'Fiere D', 'Thomas X']","[""Service d'Hematologie, Hopital E.

Tissues from newly hatched chicks exhibited the strongest and most consistent staining, whereas staining in embryos was minimal. RNA ISH confirmed the presence of ALV-J-specific nucleic acid within cytoplasmic inclusions in cardiac myocytes, Purkinje fibers, pituitary glands, and renal glomeruli.

Here, we examine the role of the repair of ionizing radiation induced base damage in relation to the radiosensitivity difference of these sublines. We used the GS/MS technique to estimate the repair rates of six types of base damage in gamma-irradiated LY cells. All modified DNA bases identified in the course of this study were typical for irradiated chromatin. The total amount of initial base damage was higher in the radiation sensitive LY-S subline than in the radiation resistant LY-R subline. The repair rates of 5-OHMeUra, 5-OHCyt, 8-OHAde were similar in both cell lines, the repair rates of FapyAde and 8-OHGua were higher in the radiosensitive LY-S cell line, whereas the repair of 5-OHUra was faster in its radioresistant counter, the LY-R.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed the outcome of 157 consecutive patients with relapsed or refractory HL, who underwent BMT between March 1985 and April 1998. Patients <or= age 55 with HLA-matched siblings were prioritized toward allo BMT. The median age was 28 years (range, 13 to 52 years) for the 53 allo patients and 30.5 years (range, 11 to 62 years) for the 104 auto patients. RESULTS: The median follow-up after BMT for surviving patients was 5.1 years (range, 1 to 13.8 years). For the entire group, the probabilities of event-free survival (EFS) and relapse at 10 years were 26% (95% confidence interval [CI], 18% to 33%) and 58% (95% CI, 48% to 69%), respectively. According to multivariate analysis, disease status before BMT (sensitive relapse if responding to conventional-dose therapy or resistant disease if not) (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.39, P < .0001) and date of BMT (HR = 0.93, P = .004) were independent predictors of EFS, whereas only disease status (HR = 0.35, P < .0001) influenced relapse. There was a trend for probability of relapse in sensitive patients to be less after allo BMT at 34% (range, 8% to 59%) versus 51% (range, 36% to 67%) for the auto patients (HR = 0.51, P = .17). There was a continuing risk of relapse or secondary acute myeloid leukemia (AML)/myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) for 12 years after auto BMT, whereas there were no cases of secondary AML/MDS or relapses beyond 3 years after allo BMT. CONCLUSION: There seems to be a clinical graft-versus-HL effect associated with allo BMT. Allo BMT for HL also seems to have a lower risk of secondary AML/MDS than auto BMT. Thus, allo BMT warrants continued study in HL.","['Akpek, G', 'Ambinder, R F', 'Piantadosi, S', 'Abrams, R A', 'Brodsky, R A', 'Vogelsang, G B', 'Zahurak, M L', 'Fuller, D', 'Miller, C B', 'Noga, S J', 'Fuchs, E', 'Flinn, I W', ""O'Donnell, P"", 'Seifter, E J', 'Mann, R B', 'Jones, R J']","['Akpek G', 'Ambinder RF', 'Piantadosi S', 'Abrams RA', 'Brodsky RA', 'Vogelsang GB', 'Zahurak ML', 'Fuller D', 'Miller CB', 'Noga SJ', 'Fuchs E', 'Flinn IW', ""O'Donnell P"", 'Seifter EJ', 'Mann RB', 'Jones RJ']","['Johns Hopkins Oncology Center, Baltimore, MD 21231, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Baltimore', '*Blood Transfusion', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease', 'Hodgkin Disease/mortality/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recurrence', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",2001/12/04 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/12/04 10:00'],"['2001/12/04 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/12/04 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2001 Dec 1;19(23):4314-21. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2001.19.23.4314.,,['10.1200/JCO.2001.19.23.4314 [doi]'],,,,,,['P01 CA15396/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,

For Saccharomyces cerevisiae, loss of a single H4-specific histone acetyltransferase (HAT), Esa1p, results in cell cycle defects and death. In contrast, although several yeast HAT complexes preferentially acetylate histone H3, the catalytic subunits of these complexes are not essential for viability. To resolve the apparent paradox between the significance of H3 versus H4 acetylation, we tested the hypothesis that H3 modification is essential, but is accomplished through combined activities of two enzymes. We observed that Sas3p and Gcn5p HAT complexes have overlapping patterns of acetylation. Simultaneous disruption of SAS3, the homolog of the MOZ leukemia gene, and GCN5, the hGCN5/PCAF homolog, is synthetically lethal due to loss of acetyltransferase activity. This key combination of activities is specific for these two HATs because neither is synthetically lethal with mutations of other MYST family or H3-specific acetyltransferases. Further, the combined loss of GCN5 and SAS3 functions results in an extensive, global loss of H3 acetylation and arrest in the G(2)/M phase of the cell cycle. The strikingly similar effect of loss of combined essential H3 HAT activities and the loss of a single essential H4 HAT underscores the fundamental biological significance of each of these chromatin-modifying activities.","['Howe, L', 'Auston, D', 'Grant, P', 'John, S', 'Cook, R G', 'Workman, J L', 'Pillus, L']","['Howe L', 'Auston D', 'Grant P', 'John S', 'Cook RG', 'Workman JL', 'Pillus L']","['Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania 16802, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Genes Dev,Genes & development,8711660,"['0 (ADA2 protein, S cerevisiae)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Fungal Proteins)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.3.1.- (Acetyltransferases)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (GCN5 protein, S cerevisiae)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (Histone Acetyltransferases)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)']",IM,,"['Acetylation', 'Acetyltransferases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Catalysis', '*Cell Cycle', 'Crosses, Genetic', '*DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fungal Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Genes, Essential/genetics', 'Genes, Lethal/genetics', 'Histone Acetyltransferases', 'Histones/*chemistry/*metabolism', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Point Mutation/genetics', 'Protein Kinases/genetics/metabolism', '*Saccharomyces cerevisiae/cytology/enzymology/genetics/metabolism', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism']",2001/12/04 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/12/04 10:00'],"['2001/12/04 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/12/04 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Genes Dev. 2001 Dec 1;15(23):3144-54. doi: 10.1101/gad.931401.,,['10.1101/gad.931401 [doi]'],,,,,,,PMC312843,,,,,

During mouse development, Scl is first expressed in extra-embryonic mesoderm, and is required for the generation of all haematopoietic lineages and normal yolk sac angiogenesis. Ectopic expression of Scl during zebrafish development specifies haemangioblast formation from early mesoderm. These results suggest that SCL is essential for establishing the transcriptional programme responsible for the formation of haematopoietic stem cells and have focused attention on the transcriptional regulation of Scl itself. Previous studies have identified a panel of Scl enhancers each of which directed expression to a subdomain of the normal Scl expression pattern. Among them, a 3' enhancer directed expression during development to vascular endothelium and haematopoietic progenitors but not to Ter119(+) erythroid cells. The expression in haematopoietic stem cells, however, remained undetermined. We demonstrate that this 3' enhancer directs lacZ expression in transgenic mice to most foetal and adult long-term repopulating haematopoietic stem cells, and therefore functions as a stem cell enhancer. Consistent with these results, expression in Scl(-/-) embryos of exogenous Scl driven by the stem cell enhancer rescued the formation of early haematopoietic progenitors and also resulted in normal yolk sac angiogenesis. By contrast, erythropoiesis remained markedly deficient in rescued embryos. This observation is consistent with the inactivity of the stem cell enhancer in erythroid cells and reveals an essential role for SCL during erythroid differentiation in vivo.","['Sanchez, M J', 'Bockamp, E O', 'Miller, J', 'Gambardella, L', 'Green, A R']","['Sanchez MJ', 'Bockamp EO', 'Miller J', 'Gambardella L', 'Green AR']","['University of Cambridge, Department of Haematology, CIMR Centre, Hills Road, Cambridge CB2 2XY, UK. mss24@cus.cam.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Development,"Development (Cambridge, England)",8701744,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Tal1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Zebrafish Proteins)', '0 (tal1 protein, zebrafish)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', '*Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Helix-Loop-Helix Motifs/genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Lac Operon', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Neovascularization, Physiologic/genetics', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Yolk Sac/blood supply/embryology', '*Zebrafish Proteins']",2001/12/04 10:00,2002/01/17 10:01,['2001/12/04 10:00'],"['2001/12/04 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/17 10:01 [medline]', '2001/12/04 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Development. 2001 Dec;128(23):4815-27.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The proliferation of early tumor progenitors increased subclone detection enabling us, in seven diagnostic samples, to determine the stage of differentiation at which each leukemia occurred. Four were derived from the stage before initiation of IgH rearrangement, one during recombination of variable, joining, and diversity segments of the heavy chain gene VDJ(H), and two after completion of IgH rearrangement. Furthermore, analysis of a t(12;21)-positive leukemia with unusually late onset, identified both TEL-AML1-positive and -negative colonies carrying a clonal T-cell receptor delta rearrangement, inferring the presence of clonal expansion before the occurrence of the t(12;21).

Twenty six cases of offspring born from dams infected with only BLV (17 cases) or with both BIV and BLV (9 cases) were examined for the presence of BLV and BIV before and after colostrum feeding by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and syncytium assay. After birth, all calves were separated immediately from their dams. The offspring born from BLV-positive dams were BLV-negative before colostrum feeding, suggesting that no transplacental transmission had occurred. Thereafter, these offspring were fed colostrum or milk from their dams, but still remained BLV-negative. The other offspring born from BLV-positive dams were fed with BLV-negative colostrum, or with pasteurized BLV-positive colostrum. All these calves remained negative for BLV infection, suggesting that in utero transmission of BLV is negligible.

After colostrum feeding from their dams, newborn calves became BLV-positive. In addition, one calf was BLV-positive even before colostrum feeding.

We previously developed a fiber-mutant Ad vector containing the Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD)-containing peptide motif on the HI loop of the fiber knob, and showed that the mutant vector had enhanced gene transfer activity to human glioma cells, which showed little CAR expression, compared to the vector containing wild type fiber. In this study, the feasibility of the Ad vector containing RGD peptide on the fiber knob was examined in a wide variety of cell types: CAR-positive or -negative human tumor cells, mouse cells, and leukemia cells. The mutant vector infected the cells, which lacked CAR expression but showed alpha(v) integrin expression, about 10-1000 times more efficiently than the vector containing wild type fiber via an RGD-integrin (alpha(v)beta3 and alpha(v)beta5)-dependent, CAR-independent cell entry pathway.

Quantitation of ds- (n2) and ss- (n1) breaks provided n1:n2 ratios of approximately 8-12, which were significantly greater than the number expected from the accumulation of ss-breaks (approximately 120).

They are particularly attractive for the monitoring of specific T lymphocyte responses in clinical trials assessing antigen-specific immunizations in patients with cancer or chronic viral infections. However, one major limitation for the broad clinical implementation of ELISPOT assays is the lack of an inexhaustible source of suitable HLA-matched antigen-presenting cells (APC). Currently available allogeneic or xenogeneic APC (such as the human lymphoid hybrid T2 or HLA-transfected insect cells) can either lead to strong background spot production by APC-reactive T lymphocytes or have a low antigen presentation capability. Both phenomena can prevent the detection of low frequency T cell responses in PBMC. In search of alternative APC for ELISPOT assays, the human chronic myelogenous leukemia cell line K562 that per se does not express HLA class I and class II molecules on the cell surface was transfected with the HLA-A*0201 gene. Clonal HLA-A*0201-expressing K562 (K562/A*0201) cells were able to process and present endogenously expressed and exogenously loaded melanoma peptide antigens to HLA-A*0201-restricted cytolytic T lymphocyte clones in cytotoxicity and IFN-gamma ELISPOT assays. K562/A*0201 cells were then used as APC in IFN-gamma spot assays to detect ex vivo CD8(+) T lymphocytes responsive to known HLA-A*0201-binding peptide epitopes derived from cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, influenza virus and melanoma in PBMC from HLA-A*0201-positive donors. In the majority of cases, peptide-pulsed K562/A*0201 cells were similarly efficient in the ability to visualize single antigen-specific CD8(+) T lymphocytes when compared to T2 cells. However, in contrast to T2, background reactivity of CD8(+) T cells responsive to unpulsed K562/A*0201 was regularly found to be negligible, thereby enhancing the sensitivity of the ELISPOT assay, particularly in donors with strong anti-T2 reactivity. K562 cells transfected with HLA-A*0201 or other HLA genes can serve as standard APC for monitoring T lymphocyte responses against tumor and viral peptide antigens.","['Britten, Cedrik M', 'Meyer, Ralf G', 'Kreer, Tanja', 'Drexler, Ingo', 'Wolfel, Thomas', 'Herr, Wolfgang']","['Britten CM', 'Meyer RG', 'Kreer T', 'Drexler I', 'Wolfel T', 'Herr W']","['Third Department of Medicine, Hematology and Oncology, Johannes Gutenberg-University of Mainz, Langenbeckstrasse 1, D-55101, Mainz, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,J Immunol Methods,Journal of immunological methods,1305440,"['0 (HLA-A Antigens)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,,"['*Antigen Presentation', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'HLA-A Antigens/genetics/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunoassay/*methods/standards', 'Interferon-gamma/analysis/*immunology', 'K562 Cells/*immunology', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Transfection']",2001/12/04 10:00,2002/02/02 10:01,['2001/12/04 10:00'],"['2001/12/04 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/02 10:01 [medline]', '2001/12/04 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol Methods. 2002 Jan 1;259(1-2):95-110. doi: 10.1016/s0022-1759(01)00499-9.,,"['S0022175901004999 [pii]', '10.1016/s0022-1759(01)00499-9 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULT(S): In the endometrium, LIF is expressed in a menstrual cycle-dependent manner, with the highest level occurring at the time of implantation. LIF is also detected in uterine flushing, and its level is significantly lower in women with unexplained infertility. Likewise, endometrial explants derived from women with unexplained infertility showed reduced levels of LIF secretion. Binding of LIF to LIF receptor and gp130 activates signal transduction pathways. LIF receptor is expressed in endometrium, oocytes, and blastocysts. Cytotrophoblasts cultured in the presence of LIF differentiate toward an anchoring extravillous phenotype. CONCLUSION(S): On the basis of reports gathered from animal and human studies, LIF appears to play an important role in implantation and in the establishment of pregnancy.","['Lass, A', 'Weiser, W', 'Munafo, A', 'Loumaye, E']","['Lass A', 'Weiser W', 'Munafo A', 'Loumaye E']","['Serono International SA, Geneva, Switzerland. amir.lass@serono.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Fertil Steril,Fertility and sterility,0372772,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (LIFR protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Embryo Implantation/physiology', 'Embryonic and Fetal Development/physiology', 'Endometrium/metabolism/physiology', 'Female', 'Growth Inhibitors/biosynthesis/*physiology', 'Humans', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit', 'Lymphokines/biosynthesis/*physiology', 'Pregnancy', 'Receptors, Cytokine/*physiology', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF', 'Reproduction/*physiology']",2001/12/04 10:00,2002/01/11 10:01,['2001/12/04 10:00'],"['2001/12/04 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/11 10:01 [medline]', '2001/12/04 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Fertil Steril. 2001 Dec;76(6):1091-6. doi: 10.1016/s0015-0282(01)02878-3.,,"['S0015-0282(01)02878-3 [pii]', '10.1016/s0015-0282(01)02878-3 [doi]']",,49,,,,,,,,,,

A major problem-the sensitivity of 1,N(6)-etheno-cADPR toward the extraction medium perchloric acid-was solved by replacing the perchloric acid extraction procedure of nucleotides by a filtration step. Standard compounds for the HPLC analysis of ADP-ribosyl cyclases and NAD(+)-glycohydrolases, e.g., 1,N(6)-etheno-cADPR, 1,N(6)-etheno-ADPR, and 1,N(6)-etheno-AMP, were produced by ADP-ribosyl cyclase from Aplysia californica and dinucleotide pyrophosphatase. The assay was applied to subcellular fractions prepared from human Jurkat T cells.

Thus, TL tetramers react specifically to CD8alphaalpha-expressing cells, including most intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes. Compared with CD8alphabeta, which recognizes the same MHC as the T cell receptor (TCR) and thus acts as a TCR coreceptor, high-affinity binding of CD8alphaalpha to TL modifies responses mediated by TCR recognition of antigen presented by distinct MHC molecules.

The activation of apoptosis is a major mode of action of chemotherapy and radiotherapy, which have limited benefit in the treatment of cholangiocarcinoma. The antiapoptotic members of the Bcl-2 protein family (Bcl-2, Bcl-X(L), and Mcl-1) are important inhibitors of apoptosis, but have not been investigated extensively in cholangiocarcinoma. METHODS: The expression of Bcl-2, Bcl-X(L), and Mcl-1 was investigated in normal biliary epithelium (17), biliary dysplasia (three), and invasive cholangiocarcinoma (51), in addition to three human cholangiocarcinoma cell lines, by immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence. RESULTS: The expression of Bcl-2 was not detected in normal or malignant biliary tissue. In contrast, granular cytoplasmic Bcl-X(L) and Mcl-1 staining was found in 60-100% of cells in all normal, dysplastic, and malignant specimens, including the human cell lines examined in this study. CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that Mcl-1 and Bcl-X(L), but not Bcl-2, are involved in the survival of normal and neoplastic cells in the biliary tree. By prolonging survival through blocking apoptosis, these proteins might be reducing the efficacy of cytotoxic anticancer treatments in cholangiocarcinoma.","['Okaro, A C', 'Deery, A R', 'Hutchins, R R', 'Davidson, B R']","['Okaro AC', 'Deery AR', 'Hutchins RR', 'Davidson BR']","['Department of Surgery, Royal Free Campus RF and UCMS, Pond Street, London NW3 2QG, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Clin Pathol,Journal of clinical pathology,0376601,"['0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)']",IM,,"['Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Bile Duct Neoplasms/*chemistry', 'Bile Ducts/chemistry', 'Cell Line', 'Cholangiocarcinoma/*chemistry', 'Epithelial Cells/chemistry', 'Humans', 'Image Processing, Computer-Assisted', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*analysis', 'Precancerous Conditions/*chemistry', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*analysis', 'bcl-X Protein']",2001/12/01 10:00,2002/01/10 10:01,['2001/12/01 10:00'],"['2001/12/01 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/10 10:01 [medline]', '2001/12/01 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Pathol. 2001 Dec;54(12):927-32. doi: 10.1136/jcp.54.12.927.,,['10.1136/jcp.54.12.927 [doi]'],,,,,,,PMC1731328,,,,,

We found that both Jurkat and PBMCs arrested efficiently in mitosis when treated with nocodazole. By contrast, all six HTLV-I cells failed to arrest comparably in mitosis, suggesting that ATL cells have a defect in the mitotic spindle assembly checkpoint. Mechanistically, we observed that in HTLV-I Tax-expressing cells human spindle assembly checkpoint factors hsMAD1 and hsMAD2 were mislocated from the nucleus to the cytoplasm.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Seventeen patients with histologically confirmed Stage IIIa and IIIb NSCLC were studied. Gemcitabine was administered via a 30-min i.v. infusion twice weekly for 6 weeks concurrent with 60 Gy of thoracic radiation. Gemcitabine, starting at a twice-weekly dose of 10 mg/m2 (20 mg/m2/week), was escalated in 10-15 mg/m2 increments in successive cohorts of 3 to 6 patients until dose-limiting toxicity was observed. RESULTS: Of the 17 patients entered, 16 were evaluable for toxicity. The dose-limiting toxicity at 50 mg/m2 given twice weekly (100 mg/m2/week) was Grade 3 pneumonitis observed in 1 patient, Grade 3 pulmonary fibrosis in a second patient, and Grade 4 esophagitis observed in two additional patients.

We investigated the effect of histamine on the expression of LOX-1 in cells of the human monocytic leukemia cell line THP-1. Histamine as well as forskolin and dibutyryl cyclic AMP (Bt2-cAMP) stimulated the THP-1 monocytes to express the LOX-1 gene at the transcription level. This histamine effect on LOX-1 gene expression, via the histamine H2 receptor-mediated cAMP signal transduction pathway, was reduced after differentiation of the cells into macrophages, even though forskolin and Bt2-cAMP still enhanced the gene expression. The alteration of the responsiveness of LOX-1 expression to histamine was related to suppressed expression of the H2 receptor in THP-1 macrophages. The switch of the predominant class of histamine receptors between H1 and H2 would modulate the effects of histamine on LOX-1 gene expression in monocytes and macrophages, and therefore, would play a certain role in the inflammatory aspects of atherogenesis.","['Tanimoto, A', 'Murata, Y', 'Nomaguchi, M', 'Kimura, S', 'Arima, N', 'Xu, H', 'Hamada, T', 'Sasaguri, Y']","['Tanimoto A', 'Murata Y', 'Nomaguchi M', 'Kimura S', 'Arima N', 'Xu H', 'Hamada T', 'Sasaguri Y']","['Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, School of Medicine, University of Occupational Environmental Health, Kitakyushu, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,FEBS Lett,FEBS letters,0155157,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Isoquinolines)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (OLR1 protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Histamine H1)', '0 (Receptors, Histamine H2)', '0 (Receptors, LDL)', '0 (Receptors, Oxidized LDL)', '0 (Scavenger Receptors, Class E)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '1F7A44V6OU (Colforsin)', '63X7MBT2LQ (Bucladesine)', '820484N8I3 (Histamine)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (CREB-Binding Protein)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (CREBBP protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.11 (Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'K7Q1JQR04M (Dinoprostone)', 'M876330O56 (N-(2-(4-bromocinnamylamino)ethyl)-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'RXY07S6CZ2 (Prostaglandin D2)']",IM,,"['Bucladesine/pharmacology', 'CREB-Binding Protein', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Colforsin/pharmacology', 'Cyclic AMP/metabolism', 'Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Dinoprostone/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects', 'Histamine/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Isoquinolines/pharmacology', 'Macrophages/cytology/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Monocytes/cytology/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/drug effects', 'Prostaglandin D2/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Histamine H1/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Histamine H2/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptors, LDL/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Receptors, Oxidized LDL', 'Scavenger Receptors, Class E', 'Signal Transduction', '*Sulfonamides', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Up-Regulation']",2001/12/01 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/12/01 10:00'],"['2001/12/01 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/12/01 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,FEBS Lett. 2001 Nov 23;508(3):345-9. doi: 10.1016/s0014-5793(01)03073-3.,,"['S0014-5793(01)03073-3 [pii]', '10.1016/s0014-5793(01)03073-3 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Utilizing parental and drug-resistant ovarian carcinoma cell lines that have acquired point mutations in beta-tubulin and p53, we studied the level of expression and modification of proteins involved in apoptosis and MT integrity. Extending previous results, we demonstrated phosphorylation of pro-survival Bcl-x(L) in an epothilone-A resistant cell line, correlating it with drug sensitivity to tubulin-active compounds. Furthermore, Mcl-1 protein turned over more rapidly following exposure to tubulin-modifying agents, the stability of Mcl-1 protein paralleling the drug sensitivity profile of the paclitaxel or epothilone-A resistant cell lines. The observed decreases in Mcl-1 were not a consequence of G(2)M arrest, as determined by flow cytometry analysis, which showed prominent levels of Mcl-1 in the absence of any drug treatment in populations enriched in mitotic cells. We also observed that a paclitaxel-resistant cell line expressed Bax at a much lower level than the sensitive parental line [A2780(1A9)], consistent with its mutant p53 status. MT-associated protein-4 (MAP4), whose phosphorylation during specific phases of the cell cycle reduces its MT-polymerizing and -stabilizing capabilities, was phosphorylated in response to drug challenge without a change in expression. Phosphorylation of MAP4 correlated with sensitivity to tubulin-binding drugs and with a dissociation from MTs. We propose that the tubulin mutations, which result in a compromised paclitaxel:tubulin or epothilone:tubulin interaction and paclitaxel or epothilone resistance, indirectly inhibit downstream events that lead to cell death, and this, in turn, may contribute to the drug-resistance phenotype","['Poruchynsky, M S', 'Giannakakou, P', 'Ward, Y', 'Bulinski, J C', 'Telford, W G', 'Robey, R W', 'Fojo, T']","['Poruchynsky MS', 'Giannakakou P', 'Ward Y', 'Bulinski JC', 'Telford WG', 'Robey RW', 'Fojo T']","['NIH, The National Cancer Institute Center for Cancer Research, Bldg. 10, Rm. 12N226, 9000 Rockville Pike, Bethesda, MD 20892-1910, USA. mporuch@helix.nih.gov']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (MAP4)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Tubulin)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)']",IM,,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Female', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/metabolism', 'Microtubules', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/pathology', 'Paclitaxel/*pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Tubulin/drug effects/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vinblastine/pharmacology', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein', 'bcl-X Protein']",2001/12/01 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/12/01 10:00'],"['2001/12/01 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/12/01 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2001 Dec 1;62(11):1469-80. doi: 10.1016/s0006-2952(01)00804-8.,,"['S0006295201008048 [pii]', '10.1016/s0006-2952(01)00804-8 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

DW2282, a diarylsulfonylurea compound, was cytotoxic to HL-60 cells, with an IC(50) of 1.0 microg/mL. Treatment with DW2282 fragmented DNA in a concentration- and time-dependent manner, suggesting that these cells underwent apoptosis. Flow cytometric analysis further confirmed that DW2282-treated HL-60 cells were hypodiploid, in terms of DNA content, and were arrested at the G(2)/M phase. The cell cycle arrest was reversible upon the removal of DW2282. HL-60 cells also underwent distinct morphological changes in response to DW2282 treatment, including the appearance of elongated cells with conical tails and other apoptotic characteristics. G(2)/M phase cell cycle arrest was accompanied by a decrease in the levels of cdc2, a protein that plays a critical role for progression through the G(2)/M phase. Treatment of HL-60 cells with DW2282 was also associated with decreased levels of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2, activation of caspase-3, and proteolytic cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. Taken together, these results demonstrate that DW2282 dramatically suppressed HL-60 cell growth by inducing apoptosis after G(2)/M phase arrest. These findings are consistent with the possibility that G(2)/M phase arrest was mediated by the down-regulation of cdc2 levels in HL-60 cells. The data also suggest that DW2282 triggered apoptosis by decreasing Bcl-2 levels and activating caspase-3 protease. These results provide important new information towards understanding the mechanisms by which DW2282 and other diarylsulfonylureas mediate their therapeutic effects.","['Piao, W', 'Yoo, J', 'Lee, D K', 'Hwang, H J', 'Kim, J H']","['Piao W', 'Yoo J', 'Lee DK', 'Hwang HJ', 'Kim JH']","['Department of Biochemistry, College of Dentistry, Kyung Hee University, 130-701, Seoul, South Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Sulfones)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (PARP1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly (ADP-Ribose) Polymerase-1)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDC2 Protein Kinase)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'IEK4128C18 (DW 2282)']",IM,,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'CDC2 Protein Kinase/metabolism', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'G2 Phase/*drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Mitosis/*drug effects', 'Poly (ADP-Ribose) Polymerase-1', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases', 'Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis', 'Sulfones/*pharmacology']",2001/12/01 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/12/01 10:00'],"['2001/12/01 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/12/01 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2001 Dec 1;62(11):1439-47. doi: 10.1016/s0006-2952(01)00796-1.,,"['S0006295201007961 [pii]', '10.1016/s0006-2952(01)00796-1 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Clinical importance of antileukaemic T-cell reactivity after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) is well established and the early experience from IL-2 therapy suggests that even autologous T-cells can mediate antileukaemic reactivity. The clinical experience also indicates that immunotherapy should begin when the leukaemia cell burden is minimal, and the detection of an operative cellular immune system, even in patients with chemotherapy-induced cytopenia, further suggests that it is possible to begin T-cell targeting therapy early after chemotherapy while patients are still cytopenic. However, adult patients in particular have a T-cell defect after chemotherapy that may last for several months. For this reason immunotherapy should probably be continued or repeated until a maximal effect is achieved when the patients no longer have a T-cell defect. This treatment approach may also be considered in combination with autologous SCT. T-cell targeting regimens should include, if possible, several therapeutic components. Firstly, native AML blasts can function as accessory cells during T-cell activation and in vivo therapy with T-cell growth factors (e.g., IL-2, IL-15) may then enhance antileukaemic reactivity or non-specific cytotoxicity against the AML cells; and secondly, a further enhancement of AML-specific reactivity may be achieved by vaccination with AML-specific peptides, immunisation with AML-blasts expressing a dendritic cell phenotype, or exposure to normal antigen-presenting cells (APC) pulsed with or expressing AML-specific peptide sequences.","['Bruserud, O', 'Wendelboe, O']","['Bruserud O', 'Wendelboe O']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Haukeland University Hospital and the University of Bergen, Norway. oystein.bruserud@haukeland.no']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Expert Opin Biol Ther,Expert opinion on biological therapy,101125414,,IM,,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Humans', '*Immunotherapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/immunology/*therapy', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/immunology']",2001/12/01 10:00,2002/08/21 10:01,['2001/12/01 10:00'],"['2001/12/01 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/21 10:01 [medline]', '2001/12/01 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Expert Opin Biol Ther. 2001 Nov;1(6):1005-16. doi: 10.1517/14712598.1.6.1005.,,['10.1517/14712598.1.6.1005 [doi]'],,109,,,,,,,,,,

Macromolecular drugs, including antisense oligonucleotides, ribozymes, RNA decoys and transdominant mutant proteins, may be able to interfere with a relatively large number of viral targets, thereby decreasing the likelihood of the emergence of drug-resistant strains. It may also be relatively easy to alter the sequence of some of the macromolecular drugs to counter emerging drug-resistant viruses. The delivery of antisense oligonucleotides and ribozymes to HIV-1 infected or potentially infectable cells by antibody-targeted liposomes, certain cationic lipid formulations and pH-sensitive liposomes results in significant anti-HIV-1 activity. These carriers not only facilitate cytoplasmic delivery but also protect the drugs from nuclease digestion. Delivery of therapeutic genes (another form of macromolecular drug) to target cells is an important challenge of gene therapy. Following delivery by a viral vector, sufficient levels of gene expression must be maintained over an extended period of time to have therapeutic activity. Robust expression of therapeutically useful ribozymes, antisense, decoys and aptamers can be achieved by the use of Pol III expression systems.

It has become clear that the early retroviral vectors based on simple retroviruses (e.g., murine leukaemia viruses (MLV) are characterised by relatively low viral titre, low transduction efficiency and difficulties in in vivo administration. On the other hand, lentiviral vectors (complex retroviruses) can be grown to a high titre, can stably transduce non-dividing cells and can effectively deliver genes to human progenitor cells (CD34+). This article aims to summarise the first year of the 21st century's developments in the retroviral gene delivery system.","['Wysocki, P J', 'Grabarczyk, P', 'Mackiewicz, A']","['Wysocki PJ', 'Grabarczyk P', 'Mackiewicz A']",,['eng'],"['Editorial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Expert Opin Biol Ther,Expert opinion on biological therapy,101125414,"['0 (Receptors, Virus)']",IM,,"['*Genetic Vectors', 'Receptors, Virus/metabolism', 'Retroviridae/*genetics/metabolism/physiology', 'Transduction, Genetic', '*Transfection', 'Virus Replication']",2001/12/01 10:00,2002/08/21 10:01,['2001/12/01 10:00'],"['2001/12/01 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/21 10:01 [medline]', '2001/12/01 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Expert Opin Biol Ther. 2001 Nov;1(6):911-3. doi: 10.1517/14712598.1.6.911.,,['10.1517/14712598.1.6.911 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

In combined Phase II studies of 142 patients with CD33+ AML in first relapse, gemtuzumab ozogamicin monotherapy was associated with a 30% overall response rate. While treated patients had relatively high incidences of myelosuppression, grade 3 or grade 4 hyperbilirubinaemia (23%) and elevated hepatic transaminases (17%), the incidences of grade 3 or grade 4 mucositis (4%) and infections (28%) were low compared with what might be expected in association with conventional chemotherapeutic treatment. In contrast with the usual in-patient administration of cytarabine and anthracycline-containing induction regimens, a large number of patients were treated with gemtuzumab ozogamicin as outpatients (38% and 41% for the first and second doses, respectively). Two prognostic factors for patients with AML in first relapse, age and duration of complete remission, had relatively little effect on response rates to gemtuzumab ozogamicin. Preliminary data in pediatric patients also suggest the immunoconjugate to be reasonably well tolerated. Studies of gemtuzumab ozogamicin in combination with anthracycline and cytarabine are underway. Gemtuzumab ozogamicin, administered to patients with CD33+ AML in first relapse, has shown overall response rates comparable to conventional agents and a safety profile that appears to be favourable.","['Sievers, E L']",['Sievers EL'],"['Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA 98109-1024, USA. esievers@fhcrc.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Expert Opin Biol Ther,Expert opinion on biological therapy,101125414,"['0 (Aminoglycosides)', '0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (CD33 protein, human)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3)', '93NS566KF7 (Gemtuzumab)']",IM,,"['Acute Disease', '*Aminoglycosides', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/*adverse effects/chemistry/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*adverse effects/chemistry/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antigens, CD/*biosynthesis', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/*biosynthesis', 'Clinical Trials, Phase I as Topic', 'Clinical Trials, Phase II as Topic', 'Gemtuzumab', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3']",2001/12/01 10:00,2002/08/23 10:01,['2001/12/01 10:00'],"['2001/12/01 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/23 10:01 [medline]', '2001/12/01 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Expert Opin Biol Ther. 2001 Sep;1(5):893-901. doi: 10.1517/14712598.1.5.893.,,['10.1517/14712598.1.5.893 [doi]'],,40,,,,,,,,,,

A significant body of research has elucidated the action of histamine in a model system that mimics the tumour microenvironment. In vitro evidence indicates that histamine inhibits the generation and release of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by monocytes/macrophages (MO) during respiratory burst. Since ROS have been shown to abrogate peritumoural and intratumoural cytokine activation of natural killer (NK) and T-cells and induce apoptosis of these cells in vitro, inhibition of ROS may enable cytokines to activate NK and T-cells and restore their antineoplastic, cytotoxic capabilities. Experimental data indicate that histamine and interleukin-2 (IL-2) act synergistically to activate NK cell cytotoxicity (NKCC). Although IL-2, a regulator of immune responses, has been shown to promote NKCC in monotherapy for metastatic melanoma (MM), renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), objective responses occur in a minority of patients and survival is not significantly extended, except for a minority of patients with MM using high-dose regimens which have not been widely adopted. In vitro findings suggest that the addition of histamine to IL-2 therapy might improve response rates and disease-free survival by protecting the cells of the immune system from oxidative stress and inducing natural endogenous immune cytotoxicity. An IL-2/histamine Phase III trial is in progress in a population of AML patients. A recently completed Phase III trial of IL-2 vs. IL-2/histamine in patients with MM demonstrated a trend towards a superior survival benefit from IL-2/histamine for all patients entered, and a statistically significant survival benefit for patients with hepatic metastases.","['Agarwala, S S', 'Sabbagh, M H']","['Agarwala SS', 'Sabbagh MH']","['Melanoma Center, University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, 755 MUH, 200 Lothrop Street, PA 15213-2582, USA. agarwalass@msx.upmc.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Expert Opin Biol Ther,Expert opinion on biological therapy,101125414,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Oxidants)', '820484N8I3 (Histamine)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Drug Synergism', 'Histamine/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/immunology/metabolism/*physiology/therapeutic use', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/immunology/*metabolism', 'Oxidants/*antagonists & inhibitors/immunology/metabolism']",2001/12/01 10:00,2002/08/23 10:01,['2001/12/01 10:00'],"['2001/12/01 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/23 10:01 [medline]', '2001/12/01 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Expert Opin Biol Ther. 2001 Sep;1(5):869-79. doi: 10.1517/14712598.1.5.869.,,['10.1517/14712598.1.5.869 [doi]'],,104,,,,,,,,,,

Specifically, we have developed phosphoramidate prodrugs of the anticancer nucleotide 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine-5'monophosphate (FdUMP). These phosphoramidate prodrugs contain an ester group that undergoes intracellular activation liberating phosphoramidate anion, which undergoes spontaneous cyclization and P-N bond cleavage to yield the nucleoside monophosphate quantitatively. In vitro evaluation of 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine phosphoramidate prodrugs 2a and 3b against L1210 mouse leukemia cells show potent inhibition of cell growth (IC(50) 0.5-3 nM). Cell-based thymidylate synthase inhibition studies show that, in contrast to FUdR, the nitrofuran compound 2a is of comparable potency in wild type vs thymidine kinase deficient LM cells. This result indicates that the activation of this novel prodrug occurs via the proposed mechanism of intracellular delivery. However, naphthoquinone 3b has an IC(50) value for thymidylate synthase inhibition that is comparable to FUdR in thymidine kinase deficient cells. Further studies revealed that 3b rapidly decomposes to the nucleotide in cell culture medium, suggesting that the naphthoquinone analogue is not sufficiently stable to function as a nucleotide prodrug.","['Tobias, S C', 'Borch, R F']","['Tobias SC', 'Borch RF']","['Department of Medicinal Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology and the Cancer Center, Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana 47907, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,"[""0 (5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridyl 2-(1,4-naphthoquinoyl)methyl"", 'N-methyl-N-(4-chlorobutyl)phosphoramidate)', ""0 (5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridyl 5-nitrofurfuryl"", 'N-methyl-N-(4-chlorobutyl)phosphoramidate)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Prodrugs)', '039LU44I5M (Floxuridine)', '134-46-3 (Fluorodeoxyuridylate)', 'E2OU15WN0N (Uridine Monophosphate)', 'EC 2.1.1.45 (Thymidylate Synthase)', 'EC 2.7.1.21 (Thymidine Kinase)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Floxuridine/pharmacology', 'Fluorodeoxyuridylate/*analogs & derivatives/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Mice', 'Prodrugs/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Thymidine Kinase/deficiency', 'Thymidylate Synthase/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Uridine Monophosphate/analogs & derivatives/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacology']",2001/12/01 10:00,2002/01/10 10:01,['2001/12/01 10:00'],"['2001/12/01 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/10 10:01 [medline]', '2001/12/01 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Med Chem. 2001 Dec 6;44(25):4475-80. doi: 10.1021/jm010337r.,,"['jm010337r [pii]', '10.1021/jm010337r [doi]']",,,,,,"['R01 CA34619/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA09634/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,

Overexpression of Bcl-2 has been observed in 70% of breast cancer, 30-60% of prostate cancer, 80% of B-cell lymphomas, 90% of colorectal adenocarcinomas, and many other forms of cancer. Thereby, Bcl-2 is an attractive new anti-cancer target. Herein, we describe the discovery of novel classes of small-molecule inhibitors targeted at the BH3 binding pocket in Bcl-2. The three-dimensional (3D) structure of Bcl-2 has been modeled on the basis of a high-resolution NMR solution structure of Bcl-X(L), which shares a high sequence homology with Bcl-2. A structure-based computer screening approach has been employed to search the National Cancer Institute 3D database of 206 876 organic compounds to identify potential Bcl-2 small-molecule inhibitors that bind to the BH3 binding site of Bcl-2. These potential Bcl-2 small-molecule inhibitors were first tested in an in vitro binding assay for their potency in inhibition of the binding of a Bak BH3 peptide to Bcl-2. Thirty-five potential inhibitors were tested in this binding assay, and seven of them were found to have a binding affinity (IC(50) value) from 1.6 to 14.0 microM. The anti-proliferative activity of these seven active compounds has been tested using a human myeloid leukemia cell line, HL-60, which expresses the highest level of Bcl-2 protein among all the cancer cell lines examined. Compound 6 was the most potent compound and had an IC(50) value of 4 microM in inhibition of cell growth using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. Five other compounds had moderate activity in inhibition of cell growth. Compound 6 was further evaluated for its ability to induce apoptosis in cancer cells. It was found that 6 induces apoptosis in cancer cells with high Bcl-2 expression and its potency correlates with the Bcl-2 expression level in cancer cells. Furthermore, using NMR methods, we conclusively demonstrated that 6 binds to the BH3 binding site in Bcl-X(L). Our results showed that small-molecule inhibitors of Bcl-2 such as 6 modulate the biological function of Bcl-2, and induce apoptosis in cancer cells with high Bcl-2 expression, while they have little effect on cancer cells with low or undetectable levels of Bcl-2 expression. Therefore, compound 6 can be used as a valuable pharmacological tool to elucidate the function of Bcl-2 and also serves as a novel lead compound for further design and optimization. Our results suggest that the structure-based computer screening strategy employed in the study is effective for identifying novel, structurally diverse, nonpeptide small-molecule inhibitors that target the BH3 binding site of Bcl-2.","['Enyedy, I J', 'Ling, Y', 'Nacro, K', 'Tomita, Y', 'Wu, X', 'Cao, Y', 'Guo, R', 'Li, B', 'Zhu, X', 'Huang, Y', 'Long, Y Q', 'Roller, P P', 'Yang, D', 'Wang, S']","['Enyedy IJ', 'Ling Y', 'Nacro K', 'Tomita Y', 'Wu X', 'Cao Y', 'Guo R', 'Li B', 'Zhu X', 'Huang Y', 'Long YQ', 'Roller PP', 'Yang D', 'Wang S']","['Structural Biology and Cancer Drug Discovery Program, Lombardi Cancer Center and Department of Oncology, Georgetown University Medical Center, 3970 Reservoir Road, Washington, DC 20007, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,"['0 (2,9-dimethoxy-11,12-dihydrodibenzo(e,g)(1,2)diazocine 5,6-dioxide)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Azocines)', '0 (Cyclic N-Oxides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)']",IM,,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Azocines/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cyclic N-Oxides/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Databases, Factual', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Protein Binding', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/12/01 10:00,2002/01/10 10:01,['2001/12/01 10:00'],"['2001/12/01 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/10 10:01 [medline]', '2001/12/01 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Med Chem. 2001 Dec 6;44(25):4313-24. doi: 10.1021/jm010016f.,,"['jm010016f [pii]', '10.1021/jm010016f [doi]']",,,,,,['P50CA058185/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,

This induction may be mediated through IL-1's actions on mu opioid receptors. Morphine stimulates the expression of adhesion molecules in human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMEC) isolated from pathological tissues. Under pathological conditions, mu opioid receptor-dependent pathways may be modulated through the induction of mu opioid receptors, especially in endothelial cells. Treatment with morphine increases [14C]-inulin permeability of an in vitro microvascular endothelial cell barrier, and decreases endothelial cell viability. Morphine pre-treatment potentiates the effects of LPS on endothelial cell viability, and on LPS induction of IL-1beta secretion from 1alpha, 25-dihydroxy-vitamin D3-treated HL-60 human leukemia cells. Previously, it was suggested that an opioid-dependent pathway may be involved in the recovery from endotoxin shock (D'Amato and Holaday, 1984). Induction of mu opioid receptors by treatment with high doses of endotoxin suggests that mu opioid receptor-dependent pathways may be involved in mediating the response to endotoxins. Taken together, these data provide valid evidence for an association between endotoxins and opioid actions. These studies suggest that opioid-dependent pathways in disease or in endotoxin exposure may be modified by cytokine-induced expression of opioid receptors in endothelial cells. In a pathological condition, an alteration of the opioid-dependent pathway may be expected. When morphine is used for its therapeutic values, it may, indeed, potentiate LPS' effects in an adverse manner. From a clinical perspective, these data indicate that morphine and an endotoxin, such as LPS, may interact in a positive 'feedback type of reaction, and thereby modulate the body's immune responses with unexpected and detrimental results.","['Chang, S L', 'Felix, B', 'Jiang, Y', 'Fiala, M']","['Chang SL', 'Felix B', 'Jiang Y', 'Fiala M']","['Department of Biology, Seton Hall University, South Orange, NJ 07079, USA. changsul@shu.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Adv Exp Med Biol,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,0121103,"['0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Opioid, mu)', '76I7G6D29C (Morphine)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Capillary Permeability/drug effects', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/biosynthesis', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytokines/biosynthesis', 'Drug Synergism', 'Endothelium, Vascular/drug effects/immunology', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Lipopolysaccharides/administration & dosage/*toxicity', 'Male', 'Morphine/administration & dosage/*toxicity', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Receptors, Opioid, mu/drug effects/genetics']",2001/12/01 10:00,2002/05/22 10:01,['2001/12/01 10:00'],"['2001/12/01 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/05/22 10:01 [medline]', '2001/12/01 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Adv Exp Med Biol. 2001;493:187-96. doi: 10.1007/0-306-47611-8_22.,,['10.1007/0-306-47611-8_22 [doi]'],,,,,,"['DA 07058/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States', 'DA 10442/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States', 'HL 63065/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,

The high morbidity and mortality associated with the intensive conditioning regimen limits allogeneic SCT to younger and healthier patients. However, it is now known that successful allogeneic SCT is dependent, at least in part, on the antitumour properties of the donor graft independent of the conditioning regimen. This potent 'graft versus tumour' (GVT) effect can now be exploited for clinical benefit. The best evidence of a direct GVT reaction comes from the use of donor leukocyte infusions (DLI). For many patients with relapsed leukaemia after allogeneic SCT, DLI re-establishes complete and durable remissions. This has suggested a novel approach to allogeneic cell therapy (ACT) using non-myeloablative, but immunosuppressive conditioning regimens to permit engraftment of allogeneic stem cells and lymphocytes. Engrafted donor cells would then provide GVT activity in the setting of reduced conditioning regimen toxicity. The ability to minimise toxicity and maximise the immunologic GVT effect will make allogeneic transplantation applicable to patients typically ineligible for conventional allogeneic SCT. Response rates with this strategy have been impressive, although toxicity related to graft versus host disease (GVHD) and other complications remains a concern. Current trials have involved heterogeneous groups of patients using various conditioning regimens. Many issues remain unsettled, including identification of the most appropriate tumour targets and definition of the most effective, least toxic conditioning regimen. In addition, the durability of response is unknown. Nevertheless, the use of non-myeloablative conditioning and ACT may provide a new paradigm for allogeneic cell transplantation and the immunotherapy of cancer.","['Bhatia, V', 'Porter, D L']","['Bhatia V', 'Porter DL']","['Bone Marrow and Stem Cell Transplant Program, Hematology-Oncology Division, Department of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania Medical Center, Philadelphia, PA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Expert Opin Biol Ther,Expert opinion on biological therapy,101125414,['0 (Myeloablative Agonists)'],IM,,"['Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Graft vs Host Disease', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Myeloablative Agonists/therapeutic use', 'Recurrence', 'Transplantation, Homologous/*methods']",2001/12/01 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/12/01 10:00'],"['2001/12/01 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/12/01 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Expert Opin Biol Ther. 2001 Jan;1(1):3-15. doi: 10.1517/14712598.1.1.3.,,['10.1517/14712598.1.1.3 [doi]'],,59,,,,,,,,,,

There is mounting enthusiasm for strategies employing active stimulation of antitumour immune responses. These include vaccines based on tumour antigen proteins and peptides, autologous, allogeneic or gene-modified tumour cells, dendritic cells and antigen-encoding viral vector constructs. Indeed, randomised Phase III clinical trials of autologous tumour cell vaccines for colorectal cancer demonstrated an improvement in disease free survival and a trend toward improved overall survival [1]. Despite these preliminary successes, it is clear that the many strategies under development cannot all be evaluated for survival benefit in large clinical trials that require many years, patients and resources to complete.

However, there are still important problems to address including what options are available for patients with chemoresistant disease and what strategies are available to avoid the concerns regarding the toxicity associated with highly cytotoxic treatment regimens. Gene therapy and immunotherapy protocols hold great promise. Using gene transfer of a marker gene, a number of biological issues in the therapy of leukaemia have been addressed. For example, by gene marking autologous bone marrow grafts it has been possible to demonstrate that infused marrow contributes to relapse in acute and chronic myeloid leukaemias. In the allogeneic transplant setting, genetically modified T-cells have proven valuable for the prophylaxis and treatment of viral diseases and may have an important role in preventing or treating disease relapse. Gene transfer is also being used to modify tumour function, enhance immunogenicity, and confer drug-resistance to normal haematopoietic stem cells. With the continued scientific advancements in this field, gene therapy will almost certainly have a major impact on the treatment of paediatric leukaemia in the future.","['Rousseau, R F', 'Bollard, C M', 'Heslop, H E']","['Rousseau RF', 'Bollard CM', 'Heslop HE']","['Center for Cell and Gene Therapy, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Expert Opin Biol Ther,Expert opinion on biological therapy,101125414,['0 (Cancer Vaccines)'],IM,,"['Cancer Vaccines/immunology/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Clinical Trials, Phase I as Topic', 'Dendritic Cells/immunology/metabolism', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genes, MDR', 'Genetic Therapy/*methods', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/physiology', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/methods', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Leukemia/genetics/immunology/*therapy', 'Oncogenes']",2001/12/01 10:00,2002/02/07 10:01,['2001/12/01 10:00'],"['2001/12/01 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/07 10:01 [medline]', '2001/12/01 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Expert Opin Biol Ther. 2001 Jul;1(4):663-74. doi: 10.1517/14712598.1.4.663.,,['10.1517/14712598.1.4.663 [doi]'],,139,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Review of data on 3 patients with acute leukemia identified among 1365 who underwent liver transplantation at our center, and a review of the literature. RESULTS: In patient 1, AML-M4 developed 19 months after transplant for cryptogenic cirrhosis. In patient 2, B cell acute lymphoid leukemia was diagnosed 10 months after liver transplant for fulminant hepatitis. Both patients had normal cytogenetics, and achieved complete remission with chemotherapy. In patient 3, acute monocytic leukemia-M3 with t(15;17) arose 18 months after transplant for hepatitis C cirrhosis. This patient received treatment with retinoic acid and chemotherapy, but developed a disseminated intravascular coagulation and died before completing therapy. No patient presented with chromosomal abnormalities commonly seen in secondary leukemia. The latency period to diagnosis after transplant was 10-19 months. CONCLUSIONS: Acute leukemia, although rare after liver transplantation, should be considered in the differential diagnosis of hematological complications.","['Doti, C A', 'Gondolesi, G E', 'Sheiner, P A', 'Emre, S', 'Miller, C M', 'Aledort, L M']","['Doti CA', 'Gondolesi GE', 'Sheiner PA', 'Emre S', 'Miller CM', 'Aledort LM']","['Department of Medicine, Mount Sinai Medical Center, One Gustave L.

In T cells and most other cell types, the primary target of IKK is a labile inhibitor of NF-kappaB, IkappaBalpha, which is responsible for the canonical NF-kappaB activation. Here, we show that in T cells infected with the human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV), IKKalpha is targeted to a novel signaling pathway that mediates processing of the nfkappab2 precursor protein p100, resulting in active production of the NF-kappaB subunit, p52. This pathogenic action is mediated by the HTLV-encoded oncoprotein Tax, which appears to act by physically recruiting IKKalpha to p100, triggering phosphorylation-dependent ubiquitylation and processing of p100. These findings suggest a novel mechanism by which Tax modulates the NF-kappaB signaling pathway.","['Xiao, G', 'Cvijic, M E', 'Fong, A', 'Harhaj, E W', 'Uhlik, M T', 'Waterfield, M', 'Sun, S C']","['Xiao G', 'Cvijic ME', 'Fong A', 'Harhaj EW', 'Uhlik MT', 'Waterfield M', 'Sun SC']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine, 500 University Drive, Hershey, PA 17033, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (NF-kappa B p52 Subunit)', '0 (Ubiquitin)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (CHUK protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (I-kappa B Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (IKBKB protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (IKBKE protein, human)']",IM,,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Gene Products, tax/*metabolism', 'Genes, Dominant', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/metabolism', 'Humans', 'I-kappa B Kinase', 'Immunoblotting', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Luciferases/metabolism', 'Luminescent Proteins/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'NF-kappa B p52 Subunit', 'Phosphorylation', 'Plasmids/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Retroviridae/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Transfection', 'Ubiquitin/metabolism', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/metabolism']",2001/12/01 10:00,2002/01/18 10:01,['2001/12/01 10:00'],"['2001/12/01 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/18 10:01 [medline]', '2001/12/01 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,EMBO J. 2001 Dec 3;20(23):6805-15. doi: 10.1093/emboj/20.23.6805.,,['10.1093/emboj/20.23.6805 [doi]'],,,,,,"['F32 CA083280/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA068471/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1F32CA83280/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '2R01 CA68471/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC125766,,,,,

A particular role in the regulation of these phenomena is played by proteins involved in early G1 phase regulation: pRb kinases: cyclin-dependent kinases (cdk): cdk4 and cdk6 activated by cyclins D, and universal cdk inhibitor p27(Kip1). DESIGN AND METHODS: We determined by flow cytometry the expression of p27(Kip1) and cyclins D (D2 and D3) in populations of peripheral blood lymphocytes obtained from 59 (for p27(Kip1)) and 31 (for cyclins D) previously untreated patients with B-CLL, and compared them with cell cycle parameters, cell viability and apoptosis in 72-hour cultures in medium only. As a control we determined the expression of p27(Kip1), cyclin D2 and D3 in peripheral blood CD5+/CD19+ lymphocytes from 15 healthy donors. RESULTS: p27(Kip1) was present in nearly 100% of lymphocytes in all B-CLL populations tested. Its cellular content estimated semiquantitatively by specific mean fluorescence intensity was higher than in normal CD5+/CD19+ lymphocytes, p27(Kip1) was inversely correlated with patients' age and not correlated with other clinical variables, cell cycle or apoptosis rate. Cyclin D2 was detectable in 25 out of 31, and cyclin D3 in all B-CLL lymphocytes populations studied. In contrast to p27Kip1 present in all CD5+/CD19+ lymphocytes, both cyclins were detected only in a subset of neoplastic cells: 27.5 to 87% (mean 51.2) for cyclin D2 and 20.3 to 98% (mean 76.5) for cyclin D3. In cyclin D2- and D3-positive normal CD5+/CD19+ lymphocytes and B-CLL cell populations, cyclin D3 was expressed in a higher percentage of cells than cyclin D2. Both cyclin D2-and cyclin D3-positive fractions of B-CLL cells were, on average, larger than corresponding fractions of normal CD5+/CD19+ peripheral blood lymphocytes. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that cyclin D3 plays an important role in the regulation of normal and neoplastic CD5+/CD19+ cells, and point to the possibility of the exit of a number of CLL lymphocytes from quiescence.","['Wolowiec, D', 'Ciszak, L', 'Kosmaczewska, A', 'Bocko, D', 'Teodorowska, R', 'Frydecka, I', 'Kuliczkowski, K']","['Wolowiec D', 'Ciszak L', 'Kosmaczewska A', 'Bocko D', 'Teodorowska R', 'Frydecka I', 'Kuliczkowski K']","['Department of Hematology, Medical University, ul.

Multiparametric flow cytometry immunophenotyping has proven to be a reliable and sensitive approach for the discrimination of myeloid blast cells from residual normal cells present in bone marrow samples from AML patients and, at the same time, allows the identification of different maturation compartments among myeloid blasts. Therefore, it provides a unique tool for assessing apoptotic and multidrug resistance (MDR)-associated phenotypes in individual subsets of leukemic cells. DESIGN AND METHODS: The aim of the present study was to explore the simultaneous expression of proteins related to both apoptosis (APO2.7, bcl-2, bax) and multidrug resistance (MDR1, MRP, LRP) in the different blast cell subpopulations detected at diagnosis in a group of 72 elderly patients with AML. In addition, we included 5 bone marrow samples from healthy adult donors in the analysis. RESULTS: Immature blast cells (CD34+: subset I) showed a significantly higher level of bcl-2 expression (p <0.0001) together with a lower reactivity for APO 2.7 (p=0.02) as compared to the other more mature CD34- cell subsets. The expression of Bax parallelled that of APO 2.7, although the difference between immature CD34+ blast cells and the mature blast cell subsets did not reach statistical significance (p=0.18). These results translated into a significantly (p<0.0001) higher bcl-2/bax ratio for the CD34+ blast cells as compared to that of the two CD34- blast cell subpopulations. Regarding the expression of the multidrug resistance-associated proteins Pgp and MRP, CD34+ blast cells displayed a greater expression of both proteins as compared to the more mature CD34- AML blast cells, but differences according to maturation stage of AML blast cells did not reach statistical significance. In contrast, LRP expression was significantly lower in the more immature CD34+ blast cell subset than in the more mature ones (p=0.01). INTERPRETATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS: As far as normal bone marrow is concerned our results suggest that all blast cell subpopulations are more protected from apoptosis than their normal counterparts. We conclude that in elderly patients with AML the more immature blast cells are more resistant to apoptotic processes, which could explain why, when AML relapses, the blast cells frequently display a more immature phenotype than that observed at diagnosis. Contradictory results in multidrug resistance profile support the hypothesis that failure to respond to chemotherapeutic drugs in AML is a multifactorial phenomenon.","['Suarez, L', 'Vidriales, B', 'Garcia-Larana, J', 'Lopez, A', 'Martinez, R', 'Martin-Reina, V', 'Tormo, M', 'Gonzalez-San Miguel, J D', 'Lavilla, E', 'Garcia-Boyero, R', 'Orfao, A', 'San Miguel, J F']","['Suarez L', 'Vidriales B', 'Garcia-Larana J', 'Lopez A', 'Martinez R', 'Martin-Reina V', 'Tormo M', 'Gonzalez-San Miguel JD', 'Lavilla E', 'Garcia-Boyero R', 'Orfao A', 'San Miguel JF']","['Department of Hematology, University Hospital of Salamanca, Paseo de San Vicente 58-182, 37007 Salamanca, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,,IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Apoptosis/*genetics', 'Blast Crisis/*pathology', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Phenotype']",2001/12/01 10:00,2002/10/03 04:00,['2001/12/01 10:00'],"['2001/12/01 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/10/03 04:00 [medline]', '2001/12/01 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2001 Dec;86(12):1287-95.,,,['PETHEMA Cooperative Group'],,,,,,,,,,,

The objective of this study was to determine the efficacy and tolerance of IFN plus oral Ara-C ocfosfate (YNK-01) in IFN-resistant CML patients. DESIGN AND METHODS: A phase II pilot study was conducted in 19 CML patients primarily resistant or with minimal cytogenetic response to IFN. Patients were scheduled to receive 6 monthly 14-day cycles of YNK-01 (500 mg/day), with progressive escalation if tolerated, in addition to IFN. Cytogenetic assessment was performed thereafter. RESULTS: Of the first 7 patients, 5 had severe hematologic and 5 moderate gastrointestinal toxicity; IFN was reduced in 6, YNK-01 in 5, and treatment discontinued in 2; hematologic response was achieved in 2 of the 5 evaluable patients. In the following 4 patients the Ara-C was reduced to 300 mg: 2 had severe hematologic and 2 moderate gastrointestinal toxicity; IFN and Ara-C were reduced in 2 patients and treatment discontinued in 2 due to progression or toxicity; the other 2 achieved a minor cytogenetic response, progressing in one to a major response after 6 more cycles. In 8 patients the starting Ara-C dose was 200 mg: 5 had moderate-severe hematologic and 5 mild gastrointestinal toxicity; IFN was reduced in 5, Ara-C in 1, and treatment discontinued in 1; Ara-C was increased in 7 cases; hematologic response was obtained in 4 patients, 2 of whom attained a minor and 1 a major cytogenetic response.

The phenomenon is extremely heterogeneous, perhaps depending on different pathogeneses of the disease. DESIGN AND METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated the outcome of 564 consecutive adult patients with primary MDS diagnosed at our Institution in a 12-year period. SR was defined as an unexpected improvement lasting more than 1 year without concomitant treatments other than vitamins or low-dose steroids (in patients with platelets < 50 x 10(9)/L). RESULTS: Nine cases of SR were observed in 3 males and 6 females (median age 38.7 years). At diagnosis, all patients had Hb levels < 10 g/dL and 8/9 required packed red cell transfusions. The median time from diagnosis to SR was 18 months (range 4-46) and all patients had normalization of peripheral blood parameters: in 2 out of 3 patients with karyotypic abnormalities at onset, a cytogenetic remission was documented. The median duration of SR was 56 months; 5 patients are still in SR and 4 patients have relapsed (1 as MDS and 3 as acute myeloid leukemia). INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: SR is a rare (less than 2% in our experience) but possible event also in adult MDS patients. It should be kept in mind in the evaluation of experimental treatments for MDS in which very low rates of complete responses are expected.","['Petti, M C', 'Latagliata, R', 'Breccia, M', 'Alimena, G', 'Spadea, A', ""D'Andrea, M"", 'Mancini, M', 'Aloe Spiriti, M A', 'Mandelli, F']","['Petti MC', 'Latagliata R', 'Breccia M', 'Alimena G', 'Spadea A', ""D'Andrea M"", 'Mancini M', 'Aloe Spiriti MA', 'Mandelli F']","['Dipartimento di Biotecnologie Cellulari ed Ematologia, University La Sapienza, via Benevento 6, 00161 Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,,IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/blood/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Remission, Spontaneous', 'Retrospective Studies']",2001/12/01 10:00,2002/10/03 04:00,['2001/12/01 10:00'],"['2001/12/01 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/10/03 04:00 [medline]', '2001/12/01 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2001 Dec;86(12):1277-80.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The study of cytokine receptor expression by flow cytometry could allow us to differentiate between normal and tumoral cells. DESIGN AND METHODS: We analyzed the expression of the interleukin-3 (IL-3) receptor a chain (CD123) in 22 normal samples and in a wide panel of hematologic malignancies using flow cytometry. We found that CD123 was expressed in the myeloid progenitor subpopulation but in contrast, normal lymphoid progenitors lacked CD123. We analyzed the CD123 expression pattern in 64 patients with acute leukemia, 45 with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and 19 with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) (13 B-cell lineage ALL and 6 T-cell lineage ALL). RESULTS: All the AML cases except two patients with M7 and all the B-cell lineage ALL patients were CD123 positive. In contrast, all the T-cell lineage ALL cases tested were CD123 negative. We also studied the CD123 expression pattern in 122 patients with a B-cell chronic lymphoproliferative disease (B-CLPD). CD123 was positive in three situations: 1) typical cases of hairy cell leukemia showed a specific, strong CD123 expression, 2) a subgroup of atypical chronic lymphocytic leukemia with a marked CD11c expression was also CD123 positive, and finally 3) transformed B-CLPD showed the phenomenon of transition from CD123 negativity to CD123 positivity simultaneuosly with morphologic changes. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: In summary, our data show high expression of IL-3 receptor a chain in hematologic malignancies. Given the high frequency of CD123 reactivity in blast cells in contrast to in normal precursors, this antigen could be applied to the study of minimal residual disease in acute leukemia. CD123 is expressed with a characteristic pattern in cases of hairy cell leukemia.","['Munoz, L', 'Nomdedeu, J F', 'Lopez, O', 'Carnicer, M J', 'Bellido, M', 'Aventin, A', 'Brunet, S', 'Sierra, J']","['Munoz L', 'Nomdedeu JF', 'Lopez O', 'Carnicer MJ', 'Bellido M', 'Aventin A', 'Brunet S', 'Sierra J']","['Hematology Department, Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau, Avda Sant Antoni M.

Our aim is to develop a highly sensitive and specific method to screen simultaneously for the four most frequent translocations in ALL: t(9;22), t(1;19), t(4;11), t(12;21). DESIGN AND METHODS: Our approach uses a multiplex-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method, which involves two rounds of PCR using fluorescence-labeled nested primers. The chimeric transcripts resulting from these translocations can be identified by agarose gel electrophoresis or by fluorescence analysis. To validate this method we carried out the analysis in 42 pediatric ALL samples previously studied by cytogenetic and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) techniques. RESULTS: In all samples with a known translocation detected by cytogenetic or FISH techniques, the same translocation was identified by the multiplex-PCR assay. Moreover, with this method we detected rearrangements in five patients in clinical remission and in two patients at diagnosis for whom karyotypes were normal and rearrangements had not been detected. The application of this multiplex-PCR assay was also useful in cases without cytogenetic results. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: These results show that the multiplex-PCR method allows reliable, sensitive and rapid detection of the prognostically significant translocations in ALL. We believe that this assay combined with cytogenetic analysis should be the strategy of choice for the initial diagnostic phase of acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and that it could be used not only at diagnosis but also to follow-up these alterations in remission samples without previous controls.","['Marin, C', 'Martinez-Delgado, B', 'Melendez, B', 'Larrayoz, M J', 'Martinez-Ramirez, A', 'Robledo, M', 'Cigudosa, J C', 'Calasanz, M J', 'Benitez, J']","['Marin C', 'Martinez-Delgado B', 'Melendez B', 'Larrayoz MJ', 'Martinez-Ramirez A', 'Robledo M', 'Cigudosa JC', 'Calasanz MJ', 'Benitez J']","['Dept. of Human Genetics, Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Oncologicas, Ctra.

Correlation with cytogenetic findings and prognostic value in children with acute lymphocytic leukemia.,1245-53,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The TEL/AML1 fusion is the most common genetic abnormality found in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALL). Although it is very difficult to identify by conventional cytogenetic techniques it can be readily detected using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). We carried out cytogenetic and FISH studies on 42 children with ALL in order to know the frequency of this translocation in our population, the incidence of TEL and/or AML1 gene alterations, and their correlation with clinical evolution and prognosis. In addition, we performed reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in some cases, confirming the feasibility of FISH techniques in the detection of this translocation. DESIGN AND METHODS: Bone marrow samples were obtained from 42 childhood ALL patients. The copy number of AML1 and TEL genes were studied using fluorescent in situ hybridization with a dual color DNA probe specific for the AML1 and TEL genes. RESULTS: We found a frequency of TEL/AML1 fusion of 17% in our sample. Double TEL/AML1 fusion, lack of TEL signal and extra AML1 signals were frequent additional FISH abnormalities. Duplication of a chromosomal complement, deletion of chromosome 12p arm, and polysomies of chromosome 21 are plausible explanations for these additional FISH findings. However, a relatively high proportion of our cases (9.5%) presented specific amplification of AML1. A statistically significant difference in prognosis was found between patients with and without these additional AML1 or TEL FISH alterations (p<0.02), which could be related to the presence of specific karyotypes. INTERPRETATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of TEL/AML1 fusion is similar to that found in other populations (17%). We found that FISH analysis of AML and TEL is related to the evolution of the disease.

Nevertheless the role of leukocytes and red cells in thrombogenesis is not well established and is probably underestimated. EVIDENCE AND INFORMATION SOURCES: The contribution of leukocytes and red cells to thrombogenesis has been reviewed. Moreover, the prevalence of thrombosis as a complication of hematologic diseases has been examined. The authors are involved in the investigation and management of acute and chronic hematologic diseases as well as in investigation of thrombophilia. Pub-Med was employed as a source of information. STATE OF THE ART: Thrombosis is a major problem in myeloproliferative disorders such as polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia. A clonal involvement of megakaryocytopoiesis resulting in elevated levels of platelet-specific proteins, increased thromboxane generation, and expression of activation-dependent epitopes on the platelet surface is regarded as the main origin of thromboembolism; nevertheless, activation of leukocytes and the consequent release of elastase and alkaline phosphatase could play an important role, determining endothelial damage. Thrombosis is a relevant problem in some hemolytic anemias such as paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria and drepanocytosis. Thrombotic events in hemolytic anemias with membrane defects have been attributed, at least in part, to hypercoagulability related to the exposure of phosphatidylserine of red cell membrane activating plasma prothrombinase and supplying a procoagulant phospholipid anionic surface. A moderate but well-established risk for thrombosis occurs in acute promyelocytic leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia; this risk could be increased by antiblastic drugs affecting the procoagulant activity of cells and the production of coagulation inhibitors from the liver. PERSPECTIVES: Thrombotic complications during hematologic diseases other than thrombophilia due to plasma alteration could be decreased not only by anticoagulant and antiaggregating agents but also by drugs inhibiting activation of leukocytes and red cells and their interaction with platelets.","['Leone, G', 'Sica, S', 'Chiusolo, P', 'Teofili, L', 'De Stefano, V']","['Leone G', 'Sica S', 'Chiusolo P', 'Teofili L', 'De Stefano V']","['Istituto di Ematologia, Universita Cattolica, largo Gemelli 8, 00168 Rome, Italy. gleone@rm.unicatt.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,,IM,,"['Animals', 'Erythrocytes/metabolism/pathology', 'Hematologic Diseases/blood/*complications', 'Humans', 'Leukocytes/metabolism/pathology', 'Thrombosis/blood/drug therapy/*etiology']",2001/12/01 10:00,2002/10/03 04:00,['2001/12/01 10:00'],"['2001/12/01 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/10/03 04:00 [medline]', '2001/12/01 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2001 Dec;86(12):1236-44.,,,,100,,,,,,,,,,

Luciferase reporter assays revealed that all four GC boxes are transcriptionally active in both MH(1)C(1) rat hepatoma and K562 human chronic myelogenous leukemia cells. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays with specific competitors and antibodies showed that members of the Sp family, namely Sp1 and Sp3, bind to these GC boxes. Overexpression of Sp1 and Sp3 in Drosophila SL2 cells stimulated transcription of the Hex gene through interactions with GC boxes 1 to 4, Sp1 being a more potent activator than Sp3.

We observed that RBA induces chromatin condensation, externalization of membrane phosphatidylserine, and DNA ladder formation, features of apoptosis. DNA ladder formation was inhibited by a general inhibitor against caspases, which are known to play essential roles in apoptosis. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that RBA and WGA cause G2/M phase cell cycle arrest with increased expression of Waf1/p21, while cell cycle arrest was not observed for VAA.

Immune approaches to cancer immunotherapy, while promising for specificity and long-term protection, have not typically proven potent enough to generate significant therapeutic responses. We have shown therapeutic benefit using recombinant murine B7.2-Ig (rmB7.2-Ig) in murine tumor models. Efficacy was dependent on immune activity and was not associated with toxicity. Recently, the efficacy of rmB7.2-Ig was demonstrated in leukemia tumor models in combination with chemotherapeutic agents. To further explore the potential of this approach, we evaluated the efficacy in solid tumor models of rmB7.2-Ig given in combination with chemotherapeutics commonly used in clinical practice, testing the effects of dose and schedule. RmB7.2-Ig in combination with some chemotherapeutics enhances the activity and efficacy of reduced chemotherapeutic doses. However, the relative timing of chemotherapy and rmB7.2-Ig dosing can be important. Investigation of mechanisms of action based on histological studies suggests that inflammatory as well as T cell mechanisms comprise the response. Additional studies of mice deleted of B7.1, B7.2, and CTLA-4 suggest that the enhanced response induced by rmB7.2-Ig may not be mediated through CD28 ligation alone. The efficacy suggests potential for recombinant human B7.2-Ig as an adjuvant to chemotherapy in promoting immune-mediated mechanisms to augment the activity of chemotherapy.","['Zhou, H', 'Sequeira, M', 'Goad, M E', 'Erickson, J', 'Wong, A', 'Clark, E', 'Dunussi-Joannopoulos, K', 'Li, R C', 'Friedrich, S', 'Hayes, L L', 'Wolf, S F']","['Zhou H', 'Sequeira M', 'Goad ME', 'Erickson J', 'Wong A', 'Clark E', 'Dunussi-Joannopoulos K', 'Li RC', 'Friedrich S', 'Hayes LL', 'Wolf SF']","['Immunology and Hemostasis, Genetics Institute, Wyeth-Ayerst Research, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02140, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Clin Immunol,"Clinical immunology (Orlando, Fla.)",100883537,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (B7-2 Antigen)', '0 (CD86 protein, human)', '0 (Cd86 protein, mouse)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD/immunology/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'B7-2 Antigen', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/immunology/*therapeutic use', '*Immunotherapy', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/immunology/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/immunology/pathology/*therapy', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/immunology/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use']",2001/12/01 10:00,2002/01/11 10:01,['2001/12/01 10:00'],"['2001/12/01 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/11 10:01 [medline]', '2001/12/01 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Clin Immunol. 2001 Dec;101(3):303-14. doi: 10.1006/clim.2001.5123.,,"['10.1006/clim.2001.5123 [doi]', 'S1521-6616(01)95123-X [pii]']",,,,['(c)2001 Elsevier Science.'],,,,,,,,

We have previously reported that OK-PSA is a potent inducer of Th1-type cytokines in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells in vitro. In this study, we conducted an animal experiment to examine whether OK-PSA exhibits an anti-tumor effect in vivo by acting as a Th1 inducer in syngeneic Meth-A tumor-bearing BALB/c mice, in which the Th2 response is genetically dominant. It was found that OK-PSA induced Th1-type cytokines [IFN-gamma, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin (IL)-2, IL-12 and IL-18] in BALB/c mice bearing Meth-A tumor and caused a marked anti-tumor effect. Although it was suggested by an in vitro study. using spleen cells derived from the animals, that IL-18 plays the greatest role in the induction of the Th1-dominant state and tumor cell killing induced by OK-PSA, the in vivo experiments demonstrated that both IL-12 and IL-18 are essential in the anti-tumor effect exhibited by OK-PSA.

In our study, UFT showed the best life prolongation among these four drugs. The intestine 5-FU level was highest by treatment with 5-FU during the initial 4 h. The plasma 5-FU level was highest by treatment with HCFU for 4 h. But the tumor 5-FU level was highest by treatment with UFT over the 24 h. In spite of the high plasma 5-FU concentration after the treatment with HCFU, the 5-FU concentration in the tumor was below the detectable level until 24 h.

They are inhibitors of S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase and indirect inhibitors of methylation. Furthermore, they have also been found to form 3-deaza-nucleotide analogs.

Cycloheximide at 0.5 &mgr;g/ml completely blocked the DNA fragmentation induced by 250 &mgr;M of each of the analogs. Interestingly, exogenous 100 &mgr;M L-homocysteine thiolactone abrogated the DNA fragmentation caused by DZAri and DZAra-A, but not by DZA. Flow cytometric analysis showed that DZA arrested the cells in the G(2)/M phase, whereas the S phase was arrested by DZAri. Correlated with the effect of DZA was a rapid decrease in the expression of c-myc, whereas nur77 and GAPDH were unaffected. In comparison, there was an elevated expression of IFN-gamma mRNA without apparent change in bax, p53 or GAPDH mRNA after 24 h. After treatment with DZA, there was an elevated expression of NF-kappaB DNA binding activity, which became more pronounced at 24 h. Simultaneously, there was an apparent disappearance of AP-1 activity. Thus, DZA most likely inhibited the RNA synthesis of c-myc, a reduction of which could trigger a cascade of gene transcription leading to apoptosis in L1210 cells. Copyright 1997 S.

The viral regulatory protein Tax has been implicated in cellular transformation events leading to the onset of adult T cell leukemia. Details on the stepwise processes through which Tax induces morphological changes in cells are poorly understood. We show here that Tax can bind to a class of intermediate filaments, the cytokeratins (Ker). Tax interacts with the 1B helical coil of keratin 8, a domain critical for higher-order intermediate filament matrix formation. Expression of Tax in epithelial cells visibly altered the structural pattern of the Ker network. In a T lymphocyte cell line, induction of Tax expression resulted in increased cellular adherence/invasion of Matrigel filters. We propose that one aspect of Tax function is the induction of morphological changes in cellular cytoskeletal structures. This finding for Tax-expressing cells might be one factor contributing directly to the pathogenesis of HTLV-I disease(s). Copyright 1997 S.

Extinction of long-term vector expression has been observed after implantation of transduced hematopoietic cells as well as fibroblasts, myoblasts and hepatocytes. Here we review the influence of vector structure, integration site and cell type on transcriptional silencing. While down-regulation of proviral transcription is known from a number of cellular and animal models, major insight has been gained from studies in the germ line and embryonal cells of the mouse. Key elements for the transfer and expression of retroviral vectors, such as the viral transcriptional enhancer and the binding site for the tRNA primer for reverse transcription may have a major influence on transcriptional silencing. Alterations of these elements of the vector backbone as well as the use of internal promoter elements from housekeeping genes may contribute to reduce transcriptional silencing. The use of cell culture and animal models in the testing and improvement of vector design is discussed. Copyright 1996 S.

HTLV-I is the causative agent of a variety of clinical diseases, including an aggressive lymphoproliferative disorder named adult T cell leukemia. HTLV-I induces pathogenicity in the infected host cell through the synthesis of a virally encoded protein called Tax. Expression of Tax is critical to the life cycle of the virus, as the protein greatly increases the efficiency of HTLV-I gene transcription and replication. Furthermore, Tax has been shown to deregulate the transcription of many cellular genes, leading to the hypothesis that the presence of Tax promotes unchecked growth in the HTLV-I-infected cell. The mechanism of Tax trans-activation of HTLV-I gene expression is not known. Tax does not bind directly to the Tax-responsive promoter elements of the virus, but appears to function through interaction with certain cellular DNA binding proteins, including activating transcription factor 2 and cAMP response element binding protein that recognize these sequences. This review summarizes some of the recent work in the field aimed at elucidating the mechanism of Tax trans-activation of HTLV-I gene expression. Copyright 1995 S.

One begins with Pr65(gag) that is processed and cleaved into the internal structural proteins of the virion. The other pathway begins with the glycosylated gag polyprotein, gPr80(gag). gPr80(gag) consists of Pr65(gag) plus additional N-terminal residues and it is glycosylated. A glycosylated-gag-negative mutant of M-MuLV (Ab-X-MLV) was previously constructed and shown to replicate in tissue culture. To test for the importance of glycosylated gag in vivo, the Ab-X-MLV mutant was inoculated intraperitoneally into newborn NIH Swiss mice. Mutant-infected mice developed typical lymphoblastic lymphomas at rates comparable to wild-type M-MuLV at either high (2 x 10(4) XC pfu/animal) or low (2 x 10(2) XC pfu/animal) doses. However, when viral protein expression was examined in the resultant tumors, six out of six mice showed evidence of virus that had recovered gPr80(gag) expression. These results suggest that glycosylated gag is important for M-MuLV propagation or leukemogenesis in vivo. Copyright 1994 S.

IGF-1 binds to the IGF-1 receptor and thereby induces the autophosphorylation of this receptor at its tyrosine residues. The phosphorylation of the IGF-1 receptor is thought to initiate a cascade of events. Although various signaling molecules have been identified, they appear to interact with the tyrosine-phosphorylated IGF-1 receptor. Here, we identified leukemia-associated Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) (LARG), which contains the PSD-95/Dlg/ZO-1 (PDZ), regulator of G protein signaling (RGS), Dbl homology, and pleckstrin homology domains, as a nonphosphorylated IGF-1 receptor-interacting molecule. LARG formed a complex with the IGF-1 receptor in vivo, and the PDZ domain of LARG interacted directly with the COOH-terminal domain of IGF-1 receptor in vitro. LARG had an exchange activity for Rho in vitro and induced the formation of stress fibers in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts. When MDCKII epithelial cells were treated with IGF-1, Rho and its effector Rho-associated kinase (Rho-kinase) were activated and actin stress fibers were enhanced. Furthermore, the IGF-1-induced Rho-kinase activation and the enhancement of stress fibers were inhibited by ectopic expression of the PDZ and RGS domains of LARG. Taken together, these results indicate that IGF-1 activates the Rho/Rho-kinase pathway via a LARG/IGF-1 receptor complex and thereby regulates cytoskeletal rearrangements.","['Taya, S', 'Inagaki, N', 'Sengiku, H', 'Makino, H', 'Iwamatsu, A', 'Urakawa, I', 'Nagao, K', 'Kataoka, S', 'Kaibuchi, K']","['Taya S', 'Inagaki N', 'Sengiku H', 'Makino H', 'Iwamatsu A', 'Urakawa I', 'Nagao K', 'Kataoka S', 'Kaibuchi K']","['Department of Cell Pharmacology, Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya University, Showa-ku, Nagoya 466-8550, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cell Biol,The Journal of cell biology,0375356,"['0 (ARHGEF12 protein, human)', '0 (Arhgef12 protein, mouse)', '0 (Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Rho Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors)', '67763-96-6 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor I)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, IGF Type 1)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rho GTP-Binding Proteins)']",IM,,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor I/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Rats', 'Receptor, IGF Type 1/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Rho Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'Stress Fibers/metabolism', 'Tissue Distribution', 'Two-Hybrid System Techniques', 'rho GTP-Binding Proteins/metabolism']",2001/11/29 10:00,2002/01/10 10:01,['2001/11/29 10:00'],"['2001/11/29 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/10 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/29 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Cell Biol. 2001 Nov 26;155(5):809-20. doi: 10.1083/jcb.200106139.

In this study, the combined effect of DDP and VM-26 on the growth and induction of apoptosis in synchronized murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells, treated at the beginning or in the middle of S-phase of cell cycle, was examined. MEL cells, clone F4 N, were synchronized by a double thymidine block leading to accumulation of 70% of cells at the G1/S boundary. The growth-inhibitory effect of DDP and VM-26 applied alone were stronger in the middle of the S-phase than at the beginning. Morphological analysis showed that the majority of the cells revealed typical signs of apoptosis: nuclei fragmentation and appearance of apoptotic bodies. The combination of both agents at low concentrations had a synergistic effect on cytotoxicity. At higher concentrations the effect was additive. The remainder of the cells were characterized by unbalanced growth, aberrant mitosis and appearance of multinucleated cells. These processes led to delayed cell death. The appearance of aberrant mitosis was more expressed after treatment in the middle of the S-phase. It is likely that as a result of the combined action of cisplatin and VM-26, cells become supersensitive to the ability of topoisomerase II inhibitor to influence mitosis, and this increased sensitivity may contribute to the observed synergism.","['Gorneva, G A', 'Spassovska, N C', 'Grancharov, K C']","['Gorneva GA', 'Spassovska NC', 'Grancharov KC']","['Institute of Molecular Biology, Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, Sofia. gorneva@obzor.bio21.bas.bg']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Z Naturforsch C J Biosci,"Zeitschrift fur Naturforschung.

The latter compound is known to induce monocytic differentiation in these cells. We found that both sulindac sulfide and TPA caused growth inhibition, cell cycle arrest in G0/G1 and increased levels of the cell cycle inhibitory proteins p21Cip1 and p27KiP1. However, whereas the TPA treated cells underwent subsequent differentiation the sulindac sulfide-treated cells displayed extensive apoptosis and negligible differentiation.

A human leukemia model consisting of T-lymphoblastic CEM/0, 7 monoclonal refractory clones resistant to both cytosine arabinoside (ara-C) and L-asparaginase (ASNase), Jurkat/E6-1 and U937, representing the leukemic blasts from relapsed patients with leukemias was investigated for secretion of VEGF before and after treatment with various agents. The T-lymphoblastic cell line, Jurkat/E6-1, was used as the negative control, which has been characterized as not expressing mRNA nor the VEGF protein, and did not secrete VEGF. With no treatment, U937, the positive control, secreted the highest VEGF concentration of 1612.7 pg/ml. The CEM/O wild type cell line and 5 other drug-resistant clones secreted VEGF at levels ranging from 180.9 to 414.2 pg/ml. Two CEM drug-resistant clones, CEM/ara-C/G/ASNase-0.5-1 and CEM/ara-C/G/ASNase-1-1, lacked VEGF production. Docetaxel (Taxotere, TXR), Vincristine (VCR), ASNase, and the Fit-1/Fc chimera, a specific inhibitor of VEGF-dependent human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) proliferation, were tested for inhibition of VEGF secretion. Treatment of the leukemic cell lines with 2 microg/ml Flt-1/Fc chimera for 24 hours completely inhibited VEGF secretion to the detection limit of the assay (<10pg/ml). After 24 hours incubation with Flt-1/Fc chimera, the leukemic cells appeared to be undergoing apoptosis, based on microphotography examination, suggesting that VEGF could be used in an autocrine loop to promote cell survival by the leukemic cells. Treatment with 0.5, 1, and 2 microg/ml Flt-1/FC chimera for 48 hours demonstrated a 15-25% growth inhibition by MTT assay. Strong inhibition of VEGF secretion in the culture media was observed after 10 microM TXR or 0.1 microM VCR for 24 hours in the wild-type and drug-resistant clones, except CEM/ara-C/I, in comparison with controls. In contrast, treatment with 1 IU/ml ASNase, a specific T-cell protein inhibitor, in 5 cell lines for 24 hours demonstrated no inhibition of VEGF in CEM/0 3 drug-resistant clones and the myeloid U937 line. We conclude that the leukemia cell lines actively secrete VEGF, in vitro. TXR and VCR, but not ASNase, strongly inhibit the VEGF production, suggesting that inhibition of this growth factor may be a mechanism of antileukemic activity. Moreover, the leukemic cell lines examined here may constitute a useful model to study antiangiogenic drugs, alone or in combination with established drug regimens used against refractory leukemias.","['Avramis, I A', 'Kwock, R', 'Avramis, V I']","['Avramis IA', 'Kwock R', 'Avramis VI']","['Department of Pediatrics, USC Keck School of Medicine, Childrens Hospital Los Angeles, CA 90027, USA. vavramis@chla.usc.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Endothelial Growth Factors)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Taxoids)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors)', '15H5577CQD (Docetaxel)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)']",IM,,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Asparaginase/pharmacology', 'Docetaxel', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Endothelial Growth Factors/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*drug therapy/physiopathology', 'Lymphokines/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic/physiopathology', 'Paclitaxel/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', '*Taxoids', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism', 'U937 Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors', 'Vincristine/*pharmacology']",2001/11/29 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/11/29 10:00'],"['2001/11/29 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/29 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2001 Jul-Aug;21(4A):2281-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

TAX, the major transactivator of HTLV-1, has been implicated in the immortalization of infected T-cells, but molecular mechanisms of in vivo malignant cell transformation induced by HTLV-1 remain unclear. To investigate the role of TAX in the monoclonal proliferation of ATL cells, we determined the nucleotide sequence of tax DNA clones obtained from 6 ATL patients and analysed the biological function of their products. We found that ATL cells from 2 of these patients possessed tax with a nonsense or frame-shift mutation resulting in the premature termination of its protein product, which was no longer functional. This strongly argued against an indispensable role of TAX for the maintenance of ATL cells in vivo. On the other hand, the frequency of nucleotide substitutions found in non-functional tax DNA clones from these patients was significantly lower than those in functional tax DNA clones from the others, suggesting a role for TAX in the genome instability of infected cells. Although mismatch repair defects in the microsatellite markers, including those in hMSH3, hMSH6, BAX, TGF-beta RII, and E2F4 genes, were infrequent, we found an increase in the number of CAG repeats of the E2F4 microsatellite marker in 1 patient.

OBJECTIVES: To correlate bi/oligoclonality, detected by polymerase chain reaction in Brazilian children with B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia with a chance of relapse, with immunophenotype, risk group, and disease-free survival. DESIGN: Prospective study of patients outcome. SETTING: Pediatric Oncology Unit of the University Hospital, Faculty of Medicine of Ribeirao Preto, University of Sao Paulo. PARTICIPANTS: 47 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia DIAGNOSTIC TEST: Polymerase chain reaction using consensus primers for the CDR-3 region of heavy chain immunoglobulin (FR3A, LJH and VLJH) for the detection of clonality. RESULTS: Bi/oligoclonality was detected in 15 patients (31.9%). There was no significant difference between the groups with monoclonality and biclonality in terms of the occurrence of a relapse (28.1% versus 26.1%), presence of CALLA+ (81.2% versus 80%) or risk group (62.5% versus 60%). Disease-free survival was similar in both groups, with no significant difference (p: 0.7695). CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that bi/oligoclonality was not associated with the factors investigated in the present study and that its detection in 31.9% of the patients may be important for the study and monitoring of minimal residual disease.","['Scrideli, C A', 'Defavery, R', 'Bernardes, J E', 'Tone, L G']","['Scrideli CA', 'Defavery R', 'Bernardes JE', 'Tone LG']","['Department of Pediatrics and Infant Assessment, Hospital das Clinicas, Faculty of Medicine of Ribeirao Preto, Universidade de Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, Sao Paulo, Brazil. scrideli@rpp.fmrp.usp.br']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Brazil,Sao Paulo Med J,Sao Paulo medical journal = Revista paulista de medicina,100897261,"['0 (Complementarity Determining Regions)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', 'EC 3.4.24.11 (Neprilysin)']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*genetics/immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Complementarity Determining Regions/genetics', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Neprilysin/analysis', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/immunology', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Recurrence', 'Risk Factors']",2001/11/28 10:00,2002/01/10 10:01,['2001/11/28 10:00'],"['2001/11/28 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/10 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/28 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Sao Paulo Med J. 2001 Sep 6;119(5):175-80. doi: 10.1590/s1516-31802001000500005.,,"['S1516-31802001000500005 [pii]', '10.1590/s1516-31802001000500005 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

However, signaling mechanisms involved in the negative regulation of SHPTP1 are unknown. This study demonstrates that protein kinase C delta (PKCdelta) associates with SHPTP1. The PKCdelta catalytic domain binds directly to SHPTP1. The results also demonstrate that PKCdelta is required, at least in part, for phosphorylation and inactivation of SHPTP1. The phosphatase activity of SHPTP1 was attenuated by coincubation with PKCdelta in vitro. In addition, treatment of U-937 human myeloid leukemia cells with 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine (ara-C) was associated with induction of the PKCdelta kinase function and inhibition of SHPTP1 activity. Down-regulation of SHPTP1 by ara-C was blocked by the PKCdelta inhibitor rottlerin but not by the PKCalpha and -beta inhibitor Go6976. Moreover, transient coexpression studies with a dominant-negative mutant of PKCdelta demonstrate that the kinase activity of PKCdelta is required for the down-regulation of SHPTP1. These findings support the functional interaction between PKCdelta and SHPTP1 in the cellular response to DNA damage.","['Yoshida, K', 'Kufe, D']","['Yoshida K', 'Kufe D']","['Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,"['0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (PRKCD protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C-delta)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPN6 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 6)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)']",IM,,"['DNA Damage/*physiology', 'Down-Regulation', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Isoenzymes/metabolism/*physiology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Kinase C/metabolism/*physiology', 'Protein Kinase C-delta', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 6', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transfection', 'U937 Cells']",2001/11/28 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/11/28 10:00'],"['2001/11/28 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/28 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 2001 Dec;60(6):1431-8. doi: 10.1124/mol.60.6.1431.,,['10.1124/mol.60.6.1431 [doi]'],,,,,,['CA29431/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,

Dr. Victor Gordeuk discusses new insights regarding the multi-faceted pathogenesis of anemia in the complicated malaria occurring in Africa. He describes recent investigations indicating the possible contribution of immune dysregulation to this serious complication and the implications of these findings for disease management. Dr. Surapol Issaragrisil and colleagues describe epidemiologic and clinical characteristics of the thalassemic syndromes. In addition to being considered a major health problem in Southeast Asia, the migration throughout the world of people from this region has caused the disease to have global impact. A unique thalassemia variant, Hb Ebeta-thalassemia, with distinctive clinical features, has particular relevance for this demographic issue. Special focus will be reported regarding recent prenatal molecular screening methods in Thailand which have proven useful for early disease detection and disease control strategies. Dr. Raul Ribeiro describes a clinical model for providing effective treatment for a complex malignancy (childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia) in countries with limited resources. With the multidisciplinary approach in Central American of the joint venture between St. Jude Children's Research Hospital International Outreach Program and indigenous health care personnel, major therapeutic advances for this disease have been achieved. Given the major demographic population shifts occurring worldwide, these illnesses also have important clinical implications globally. These contributions demonstrate that lessons learned within countries of disease prevalence aid our understanding and management of a number of disorders prominently seen in developed countries. They will show how effective partnerships between hematologists in more and less developed nations may work together to produce important advances for treating major hematologic diseases in less developed regions. A major focus relates to the socio-economic and medical burden of these diseases in developing countries with limited resources. As such, these problems provide a challenge and an opportunity for collaborative interaction between hematologists and policy makers worldwide.","['Greenberg, P L', 'Gordeuk, V', 'Issaragrisil, S', 'Siritanaratkul, N', 'Fucharoen, S', 'Ribeiro, R C']","['Greenberg PL', 'Gordeuk V', 'Issaragrisil S', 'Siritanaratkul N', 'Fucharoen S', 'Ribeiro RC']","['Howard University.

Specifically, the focus has shifted away from attempts at eradicating underlying diseases through toxic high-dose chemoradiation therapy towards using the stem cell donor's immune cells for that purpose (allogeneic graft-versus-tumor effect). The non-myeloablative transplant approaches hold promise in reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with conventional high-dose chemoradiation therapy, and they allow allogeneic transplants in elderly or medically infirm patients who are at present not candidates for transplantation. In the future, specific graft-versus-tumor responses may become possible by eliciting donor T cell responses to tumor-associated minor histocompatibility antigens. In Section I, Dr. Rainer Storb describes experimental studies in random-bred dogs that rely on non-cytotoxic immunosuppressive agents to establish stable allografts. Powerful postgrafting immunosuppression, traditionally directed at preventing graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), is also used to overcome host-versus-graft (HVG) reactions, thereby dramatically reducing the need for intensive immunosuppressive conditioning programs. Preclinical canine studies have been translated into the clinical setting for treatment of elderly or medically infirm patients with malignant hematological diseases. The pretransplant conditioning has been reduced to a single dose of 2 Gy total body irradiation (TBI) with or without fludarabine. The lack of toxicity makes it possible for transplants to be conducted in the outpatient setting. Multicenter trials have been initiated, and more than 300 patients have been successfully treated with hematopoietic stem cell grafts both from related and unrelated HLA-matched donors. In Section II, Dr. Richard Champlin describes clinical studies with therapeutic strategies that utilize relatively non-toxic, nonmyeloablative disease-specific preparative regimens incorporating fludarabine, together with other chemotherapeutic agents, to achieve disease suppression and engraftment of allogeneic hematopoietic cells and to allow subsequent infusions of donor lymphocytes. Remissions have been seen in patients with acute myelocytic, chronic myelocytic, chronic lymphocytic, leukemias, lymphomas, and myelomas. In Section III, Dr. Stanley Riddell and colleagues describe studies on isolation of T cells reactive with minor histocompatibility (H) antigens and involved both in GVHD and graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) responses. For example, the gene encoding a novel H-Y antigen in humans has been identified and shown to exhibit restricted tissue expression. Acute myelocytic leukemia stem cells were demonstrated to express the H-Y antigen and additional minor H antigens, and engraftment of such cells in NOD/SCID mice could be selectively prevented by minor antigen-specific T-cell clones. An autosomal encoded human minor H antigen associated with chronic GVHD has been demonstrated. A trial evaluating therapy of relapsed acute myelocytic leukemia or acute lymphoblastic leukemia after allogeneic stem cell transplantation with T-cell clones specific for recipient minor H antigens has been initiated.","['Storb, R F', 'Champlin, R', 'Riddell, S R', 'Murata, M', 'Bryant, S', 'Warren, E H']","['Storb RF', 'Champlin R', 'Riddell SR', 'Murata M', 'Bryant S', 'Warren EH']","['Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center, Seattle, WA 98109-1024, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Hematology Am Soc Hematol Educ Program,Hematology.

Problems with PTCL include their rarity, representing usually 10-15% of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas in the Western Hemisphere, morphologic heterogeneity, and lack of immunophenotypic markers for clonality. Additionally, their clinical behavior is variable and may not correlate with morphology. Dr. Kinney gives a general overview of the diagnosis of PTCL and NK cell neoplasms. Emphasis will be placed on extranodal T cell and natural killer (NK) cell lymphomas such as hepatosplenic lymphoma, subcutaneous panniculitis-like lymphoma and nasal/nasal type T/NK-cell lymphoma. The use of ALK gene regulation in the classification of anaplastic large cell lymphoma is also reviewed. Dr. Loughran describes current understanding of the pathogenesis of large granular lymphocyte (LGL) leukemia. The discussion focuses on LGL leukemia as an instructive model of dysregulated apoptosis causing both malignant and autoimmune disease. Current management options and mechanisms of therapeutic response are also described. Dr. Greer addresses whether PTCL should be treated differently from the more common diffuse large B cell lymphomas. He discusses the therapeutic options for anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), from a conservative approach for primary cutaneous ALCL to combination chemotherapy for the highly chemosensitive ALCL expressing anaplastic lymphoma kinase.

Rai and Emili Montserrat form the panel to review chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) while focusing on the clinical features of a particular patient. The pace of progress in CLL has accelerated in the past decade. The pathophysiological nature of this disease, as had been known in the past, was based largely on the intuitive and empiric notions of two leaders in hematology, William Dameshek and David Galton. Now the works of a new generation of leaders are providing us with the scientific explanations of why CLL is a heterogeneous disease, perhaps consisting of at least two separate entities. In one form of CLL, the leukemic lymphocytes have a surface immunoglobulin (Ig) variable region gene that has undergone somatic mutations, with tell-tale markers suggesting that these cells had previously traversed the germinal centers. Such patients have a distinctly superior prognosis than their counterparts whose leukemic lymphocytes IgV genes have no mutations (these are indeed immunologically naive cells), who have a worse prognosis. The introduction of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) technique has provided us with new insights into the diverse chromosomal abnormalities that can occur in CLL, and which have significant impact on the clinical behavior and prognosis of patients with this disease. Major advances in therapeutics of CLL also have occurred during the past decade. Two monoclonal antibodies, Campath-1H (anti-CD52) and rituximab (anti-CD20), and one nucleoside analogue, fludarabine, have emerged as three agents of most promise in the front-line treatment of this disease. Studies currently in progress reflect our attempts to find the most effective manner of combining these agents to improve the overall survival statistics for CLL patients. As in many other hematological malignancies, high dose chemotherapy followed by autologous or HLA-compatible allogeneic stem cells rescue strategies are under study as a salvage treatment for a relatively younger age group of CLL patients with poor prognosis characteristics.","['Rai, K R', 'Dohner, H', 'Keating, M J', 'Montserrat, E']","['Rai KR', 'Dohner H', 'Keating MJ', 'Montserrat E']","['Division of Hematology-Oncilogy, Long Island Jewish Medical Center, New Hyde Park, NY 11040, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Hematology Am Soc Hematol Educ Program,Hematology.

In this article, Dr. Jacob Rowe presents a summary of the current state-of-the-art therapy for adult AML. His contribution emphasizes the fact that AML is not a single disease, but a number of related diseases each distinguished by unique cytogenetic markers which in turn help determine the most appropriate treatment. Dr. Jerald Radich continues on this theme, emphasizing how these cytogenetic abnormalities, as well as other mutations, give rise to abnormal signal transduction and how these abnormal pathways may represent ideal targets for the development of new therapeutics. A third contribution by Dr. Frederick Appelbaum describes how AML might be made the target of immunologic attack. Specifically, strategies using antibody-based or cell-based immunotherapies are described including the use of unmodified antibodies, drug conjugates, radioimmunoconjugates, non-ablative allogeneic transplantation, T cell adoptive immunotherapy and AML vaccines. Finally, Dr. John Dick provides a review of the development of the NOD/SCID mouse model of human AML emphasizing both what it has taught us about the biology of the disease as well as how it can be used to test new therapies.

This review examines the available information regarding the rising incidence of invasive aspergillosis in different high-risk groups, including persons with acute leukemia, hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients, and liver and lung transplant recipients. The risk factors for infection in these groups are discussed. Because Aspergillus species are widespread in the environment, it is difficult to link specific sources and exposures to the development of human infections. However, molecular strain typing and other studies indicate that a significant number of Aspergillus infections are now being acquired outside the health care setting, either before patients are admitted to hospital, or after they have been discharged. The role of environmental control measures and antifungal drug prophylaxis in the prevention of hospital- and community-acquired aspergillosis is discussed.","['Warnock, David W.', 'Hajjeh, Rana A.', 'Lasker, Brent A.']","['Warnock DW', 'Hajjeh RA', 'Lasker BA']","['Mycotic Diseases Branch, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1600 Clifton Road, Mailstop G-11, Atlanta, GA 30333, USA.

Treatment with liposomal amphotericin B was initiated along with surgical excision of the fungal brain abscess. Intrathecal instillation of amphotericin B deoxycholate was started using an Ommaya reservoir because of an anatomical connection between the postoperative cavity and the ventricle. Full dose cytostatic chemotherapy was continued with little delay. A computerised tomography scan of the chest performed 2 months later revealed no fungal abscesses. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain did not reveal any fungal manifestation. During maintenance therapy/week 69, the patient relapsed from leukaemia. High doses of intravenous liposomal amphotericin B were administered prophylactically. The patient's leukaemia proved refractory to reinduction chemotherapy and the patient died from pneumonia 8 wk later. Post mortem microbiological investigation and histopathological examination of lung and brain tissue did not reveal any macroscopical or microscopical fungal manifestations.

None had cutaneous symptoms such as erythema or urticaria. Cytogenetic analyses in the first patient showed a normal karyotype, while the second displayed a translocation t(2;6); (q23?4;p22?3), as well as a del (12)(p11). Earlier observations have linked bone marrow basophilia either to a deletion of the short arm of chromosome 12 (p11-13), to translocations involving the long arm of chomosome 6 at 6q23 or to the translocation t(6,9); (p23;q34). However, other translocations involving chromosome 6p23 have not been described before.

Previous results from our group have shown a strong expression of JAK-STAT proteins in primary acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) blasts and AML cell lines. Here, we asked whether a constitutive activation of the JAK-STAT pathway might be involved in the pathogenesis of AML. We could demonstrate a constitutive activation of STAT1, 3 and 5 by immunoprecipitation of the tyrosine phosphorylated proteins in different human AML cell lines. Three patterns of STAT activation were found: (I) activation of only STAT1, (II) activation of STAT1 in combination with STAT3, and (III) activation of STAT1, 3 and 5. Furthermore, STAT1 and 3 formed stable heterodimers only in cell lines with constitutive STAT3 activation. In all cell lines analyzed, tyrosine phosphorylation of the four known Janus kinases could not be detected, although JAK1 was stably associated with STAT3. To further analyze whether a constitutive activation of tyrosine kinases might contribute to the autonomous growth of AML blasts, inhibitor studies were performed. The tyrphostin AG490, an inhibitor of the JAK-STAT pathway, but not A1, an inactive tyrphostin induced a time- and dose-dependent growth arrest without overt morphological signs of differentiation in AML cell lines. Our results show that STAT transcription factors are constitutively activated in human AML cell lines and might contribute to the autonomous proliferation of AML blasts. Inhibition of this pathway might be of interest for the establishment of more specific antileukemic strategies.","['Spiekermann, K', 'Biethahn, S', 'Wilde, S', 'Hiddemann, W', 'Alves, F']","['Spiekermann K', 'Biethahn S', 'Wilde S', 'Hiddemann W', 'Alves F']","['Department of Medicine III, Grosshadern, Germany. karsten.spiekermann@med3.med.uni-muenchen.de']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Milk Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (STAT1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT1 protein, human)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (Tyrphostins)', '0 (alpha-cyano-(3,4-dihydroxy)-N-benzylcinnamide)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (TYK2 Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (TYK2 protein, human)']",IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/chemistry/*physiology', 'Dimerization', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/biosynthesis/genetics', 'HL-60 Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Interleukin-6/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Janus Kinase 1', 'K562 Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/pathology', '*Milk Proteins', 'Neoplasm Proteins/chemistry/*physiology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', 'Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor', 'Signal Transduction/genetics', 'TYK2 Kinase', 'Trans-Activators/chemistry/*physiology', 'Transcription, Genetic/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Tyrphostins/pharmacology', 'U937 Cells/drug effects/metabolism']",2001/11/28 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/11/28 10:00'],"['2001/11/28 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/28 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2001 Aug;67(2):63-71.,,['385 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Forty-four Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-positive patients were transplanted in nine German centres; 26 patients were in chronic phase, 11 in accelerated phase and seven in blast crisis. Thirty-four patients achieved complete remission, with 18 alive and disease-free at a median follow-up of 562 d (range 244-922 d). Grade II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) incidence was 43%. Twenty patients died, 15 of causes unrelated to relapse. Risk factors predisposing to graft failure by univariate analysis were an unrelated donor (8/23 compared with a related donor 2/21, P = 0.07) and interferon therapy within 90 d of transplant (4/6 versus 3/17, P = 0.025). At the last follow-up, of 31 patients for whom molecular or cytogenetic data were available, 16 (52%) were polymerase chain reaction-negative, and seven (23%) were Ph-negative by fluorescent in situ hybridization.

Lamivudine is a nucleoside analogue that can directly suppress HBV replication. We have performed a pilot study to test the efficacy and tolerability of lamivudine as a primary prophylaxis of HBV reactivation in 20 consecutive patients treated for haematological malignancies, mainly of lymphoid origin. Lamivudine, 100 mg/d, was given orally from the start until 1 month after the end of chemotherapy, which included corticosteroids and/or purine analogues in 85% of cases. It was well tolerated and did not cause any unexpected reduction of cytostatic drugs dosages. The chemotherapy programme was completed in all patients without modifications. A transient threefold increase in serum amylase was observed in one case. HBV-DNA levels decreased in six out of six patients (P = 0.039) and ALT levels in five out of six patients (P = 0.057) whose serum levels were abnormal at the onset of therapy. Two patients developed transient hepatitis. HBV reactivation was documented in only one of these patients who had stopped lamivudine 1 month before. No signs of HBV reactivation were detected both during and after treatment in 18 patients with a median follow-up of 6 months (range 3-12). Thus, primary prophylaxis with lamivudine may be a well tolerated and effective method to reduce the frequency of chemotherapy-induced HBV reactivation in chronic HBsAg carriers.","['Rossi, G', 'Pelizzari, A', 'Motta, M', 'Puoti, M']","['Rossi G', 'Pelizzari A', 'Motta M', 'Puoti M']","['Sezione Ematologia, Universita di Brescia, Spedali Civili, Brescia, Italy. rossi@bshosp.osp.unibs.it']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Hepatitis B Surface Antigens)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '2T8Q726O95 (Lamivudine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'CHOP protocol', 'FLAG protocol']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Antiviral Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/administration & dosage', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/virology', 'Hepatitis B/*prevention & control', 'Hepatitis B Surface Antigens/blood', 'Hepatitis B virus/growth & development', 'Hodgkin Disease/drug therapy/virology', 'Humans', 'Lamivudine/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/virology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/virology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/drug therapy/virology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/drug therapy/virology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage', 'Virus Activation/drug effects']",2001/11/28 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/11/28 10:00'],"['2001/11/28 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/28 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2001 Oct;115(1):58-62. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2001.03099.x.,,"['3099 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2001.03099.x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Three criteria were used to judge the early treatment response: persistence of peripheral blasts (PPB) or of bone marrow blasts (PBMB) during induction therapy and minimal residual disease (MRD) after completion of induction therapy. Studies with more than 50 patients, published between 1980 and 2000, were reviewed. Among 13 659 distinct articles published on ALL, we identified only 43 applicable studies. Within- and between-laboratory variations were evaluated in only one study. Treatment modalities differed among, and sometimes within, studies. The cut-off points used in the statistical analyses were never discussed, and in many studies appeared to be selected after multiple tests. The proportion of missing data was > 30% in almost all studies of MRD, as a result of technical difficulties and not missing samples. PPB and PBMB were associated with shorter survival in, respectively, 13 out of 14 and 15 out of 16 studies. Detection of MRD was associated with poor outcome in 12 of the 13 studies. Because none of the parameters used to measure the early response to induction therapy for childhood ALL have been properly assessed as prognostic factors, we conclude that they should be considered only as candidate prognostic indicators pending more thorough studies.","['Donadieu, J', 'Hill, C']","['Donadieu J', 'Hill C']","[""Service de Biostatistique et d'epidemiologie, Institut Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France. jean.donadieu@trs.ap-hop-paris.fr""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,IM,,"['Bone Marrow/immunology', 'Cytogenetics', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Prognosis', '*Remission Induction', 'Time Factors']",2001/11/28 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/11/28 10:00'],"['2001/11/28 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/28 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2001 Oct;115(1):34-45. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2001.03064.x.,,"['3064 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2001.03064.x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The patients were allocated into three risk groups based on cytogenetics, occurrence of antecedent haematological disorder and leucocyte count.

In multivariate analyses, the number of cycles needed to achieve CR and the risk group were significantly associated with the duration of CR. Median survival time for the entire cohort of patients was only 107 d. Advanced age, low induction treatment intensity, treatment during earlier years and adverse-risk group were associated with shorter overall survival times. Risk group classification may help selection of elderly patients with a good chance of benefiting from intensive treatment to actually receive such treatment, while sparing others with a low probability of survival benefit from toxic treatment. Low intensity induction treatment reduces the chance of obtaining complete remission, produces inferior survival times and should consequently be avoided when the aim is to obtain complete remission. In elderly AML patients, introducing age and re-evaluation of intermediate and good prognosis patients regarding response to induction treatment may improve the risk group classification.","['Wahlin, A', 'Markevarn, B', 'Golovleva, I', 'Nilsson, M']","['Wahlin A', 'Markevarn B', 'Golovleva I', 'Nilsson M']","['Department of Medicine, Section of Haematology, Umea University, Umea, Sweden. anders.wahlin.us@vll.se']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,IM,['Br J Haematol. 2002 Aug;118(2):683.

In the present study, we evaluated TfR gene expression at the molecular level in bone marrow (BM) samples of 44 patients with de novo acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) at diagnosis with BM blasts > 85%. TfR mRNA levels were determined by densitometric analysis of quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction products corresponding to TfR exons 15-17. Each sample was tested in at least two independent experiments. In 13/44 patients, TfR messages were not detected (this is probably an underestimate as some positive results may be attributed to residual normal erythroid cells present in the samples). In 17/44, TfR mRNA levels were low-intermediate, and were high in the remaining patients (14/44). TfR mRNA positivity was significantly associated with older age.

It was recently suggested that near-tetraploid AML may be associated specifically with t(8;21)(q22;q22). We report here a new case of near-tetraploid AML with double t(8;21)(q22;q22) translocations. A 61-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital because of high fever and pancytopenia. Her bone marrow was markedly hypercellular, with 72% giant and bizarre myeloblasts. These myeloblasts were positive for CD7, CD13, CD19, CD33, CD34, and HLA-DR but negative for CD2 and CD56. The patient's disease was diagnosed as the M2 subtype of AML (by French-American-British classification).

Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed the presence of the AML1/ETO fusion transcript. These findings suggested that near-tetraploidy may be a secondary genetic change originating from a diploid clone with t(8;21) and that 2 AML1/ETO fusion genes are generated on the der(8)t(8;21) in near-tetraploid clones. Consideration of the other reported cases suggests that the immunophenotypes of near-tetraploid AML with double t(8;21) are heterogenous, but it is possible that t(8;21)-AML with expression of CD2 or CD7 may be associated with a secondary clonal evolution to near-tetraploidy.","['Yamamoto, K', 'Nagata, K', 'Kida, A', 'Tsurukubo, Y', 'Hamaguchi, H']","['Yamamoto K', 'Nagata K', 'Kida A', 'Tsurukubo Y', 'Hamaguchi H']","['Department of Hematology, Musashino Red Cross Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (AML1-ETO fusion protein, human)', '0 (Antigens, CD7)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,,"['Antigens, CD7/*metabolism', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8', 'Clone Cells/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/immunology/*pathology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', '*Polyploidy', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic/*genetics']",2001/11/28 10:00,2002/09/26 06:00,['2001/11/28 10:00'],"['2001/11/28 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/26 06:00 [medline]', '2001/11/28 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2001 Oct;74(3):316-21. doi: 10.1007/BF02982067.,,['10.1007/BF02982067 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

We have synthesized glycoconjugate cationic polymers carrying 3,6-branched alpha-D-mannoside, a trimannose conjugate (TMC) with a high affinity for mannose-specific lectins. Culture with 10 microM TMC for 6 hours induced adhesion and aggregation in NKM-1, a human myelomonocytic leukemia cell line. TMC also stimulated the accumulation of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-dextran (FITC-DX). This accumulation seemed to be mediated by endocytosis via MMR because mannan, which specifically binds to MMR, inhibited FITC-DX accumulation. Expression of CD14, adhesion molecules, and costimulatory molecules was induced for 24 hours in NKM-1 and in fresh leukemia blasts from 4 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) M4 and M5 subtypes (French-American-British classification). To clarify the binding mechanism, we compared mannose conjugates and a monomer of mannose regarding their effects on endocytosis and enhancement of CD14 and CD86 expression. A polymer of monomannose clusters with a lower affinity for lectins slightly stimulated exdocytosis, whereas a monomer of trimannose had no effect. These findings suggest that concatenation between MMR and TMC may play an important role in the activation of monocytic leukemia cells. TMC may become a good candidate to target MMRs of leukemia cells.","['Kanbe, E', 'Emi, N', 'Abe, A', 'Tanaka, H', 'Kobayashi, K', 'Saito, H']","['Kanbe E', 'Emi N', 'Abe A', 'Tanaka H', 'Kobayashi K', 'Saito H']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (Adjuvants, Immunologic)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (B7-2 Antigen)', '0 (CD86 protein, human)', '0 (Dextrans)', '0 (Lectins, C-Type)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharide Receptors)', '0 (Mannose Receptor)', '0 (Mannose-Binding Lectins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Trisaccharides)', '0 (fluorescein isothiocyanate dextran)', 'I223NX31W9 (Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate)', 'PHA4727WTP (Mannose)']",IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Adjuvants, Immunologic/*metabolism', 'Antigens, CD/drug effects/metabolism', 'B7-2 Antigen', 'Bone Marrow Cells/drug effects/pathology', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects', 'Dextrans/pharmacokinetics', 'Endocytosis/*drug effects', 'Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate/analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', '*Lectins, C-Type', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/immunology/*pathology', 'Lipopolysaccharide Receptors/drug effects/metabolism', 'Macrophages/chemistry', 'Mannose/analogs & derivatives/chemical synthesis/*pharmacology', 'Mannose Receptor', '*Mannose-Binding Lectins', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/drug effects/metabolism', 'Molecular Structure', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/metabolism/physiology', 'Trisaccharides/chemical synthesis/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",2001/11/28 10:00,2002/09/26 06:00,['2001/11/28 10:00'],"['2001/11/28 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/26 06:00 [medline]', '2001/11/28 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2001 Oct;74(3):309-15. doi: 10.1007/BF02982066.,,['10.1007/BF02982066 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Polymerase chain reaction amplification was performed using a fluorescent-dye-labeled primer under conditions specific for GC-rich targets, and fragments were analyzed. To estimate the length of these fragments, FAM-labeled (blue fluorescent) products were simultaneously compared with ROM-labeled size markers (red) that were created by sequencing various HUMARA fragments. The number of polymorphic CAG repeats of HUMARA in 116 alleles from 58 female subjects ranged from 15 to 28. Of the 58 volunteers, 51 (88.0%) were heterozygous. In 96% of the heterozygous female subjects, the allelic differences were no greater than 6 repeats.

Recently, we developed a new polyclonal antibody specific to F-blasts by immunization of a rabbit with synthetic peptides of human HbF. Specificity and reactivity of the antibody were confirmed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunohistochemistry. ELISA confirmed that the antibody showed strong immunoreactivity to fetal hemoglobin but no reaction to adult hemoglobin. The antibody could detect the presence of fetal blood hemolysates (10 microg/mL) at a dilution of 10(-5). According to immunohistochemical analysis, there were strong positive reactions to fetal erythroblasts in the liver and the spleen at 29 weeks of gestation and to erythroblasts from patients with myelodysplastic syndromes and erythroleukemia but no reactions to normal adult erythroblasts in bone marrow. Fetal erythrocytes in fetal blood vessels of placental tissues were strictly distinguished from maternal erythrocytes in the same sections by their positive reactions, indicating the presence of HbF. This new antibody will be a useful tool for studying fetal hemoglobin synthesis and for detecting F-blasts in archival specimens of various hematological diseases.","['Choi, J W', 'Kim, Y', 'Fujino, M', 'Ito, M']","['Choi JW', 'Kim Y', 'Fujino M', 'Ito M']","['Department of Pathology, Nagoya University Hospital, Nagoya, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '9034-63-3 (Fetal Hemoglobin)']",IM,,"['Amino Acid Sequence', '*Antibodies/immunology', 'Antibody Affinity', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology', 'Epitopes/chemistry', 'Erythroblasts/chemistry/cytology/*immunology', 'Fetal Hemoglobin/analysis/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/pathology', 'Liver/chemistry/cytology/embryology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/pathology', 'Oligopeptides/chemical synthesis/immunology', 'Spleen/chemistry/cytology/embryology']",2001/11/28 10:00,2002/09/26 06:00,['2001/11/28 10:00'],"['2001/11/28 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/26 06:00 [medline]', '2001/11/28 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2001 Oct;74(3):277-80. doi: 10.1007/BF02982061.,,['10.1007/BF02982061 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

These structural abnormalities result in the generation of genetic mutations that play a direct role in the transformation of hematopoietic stem cells. Some of the most common targets of these chromosomal rearrangements are the genes that encode the AML1/CBFbeta transcription factor complex. The AML1/CBFbeta complex plays a critical role in normal hematopoiesis, controlling the initiation of a transcriptional cascade required for the formation of definitive hematopoietic stem cells. Understanding how alterations in the normal biologic activity of this transcription factor complex lead to the initiation of leukemia will provide critical insights in the molecular pathogenesis of this disease. These insights in turn are likely to lead to the development of more rational approaches to the treatment of acute leukemia.

One of them is the leukemia-associated transcription factor acute myeloid leukemia 1 (AML1; also known as runt-related transcription factor 1, or RUNX1). This gene was originally cloned from the breakpoint of the t(8;21) reciprocal chromosome translocation and was later recognized as one of the most frequent targets of leukemia-associated gene aberrations. Gene-targeting experiments revealed that transcriptionally active AML1 is essential for the establishment of definitive hematopoiesis. More specifically, this gene functions in the emergence of the hematopoietic progenitor cells from the hemogenic endothelium by budding in the aorta-gonad-mesonephros region, and its expression points to the sites with strong potential for the emergence of hematopoietic stem cells.

In addition, recent studies have demonstrated point mutations in the RUNX1 gene as an another mode of genetic lesion resulting in leukemia. Of particular interest, sporadic point mutations of biallelic type are found in a tight association with either the acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) MO subtype or trisomy 21. Germline mutations give rise to a familial platelet disorder that results in a predisposition to acute myelogenous leukemia (FPD/AML). Most of the RUNX1 mutants were defective in DNA binding but still active in beta binding, a characteristic that is consistent with the 3-dimensional structural findings and may explain the dominant inhibitory effects. Although genuine haploinsufficiency of RUNX1 was observed in some cases, a greater majority of mutant RUNX1 proteins may also act in a dominant-negative manner, possibly creating a higher propensity for leukemia development. The stronger dominant-negative effect was also deduced to be the major mechanism of the chimeric genes created by chromosomal translocations. The decrement of RUNXI activity may be a common underlying cause for RUNX1-related leukemias. However, because these RUNX1 abnormalities per se are insufficient for leukemogenesis, cooperating genetic alteration(s) should be intensively sought for further mechanistic insights and future clinical applications.","['Osato, M', 'Yanagida, M', 'Shigesada, K', 'Ito, Y']","['Osato M', 'Yanagida M', 'Shigesada K', 'Ito Y']","['Department of Viral Oncology, Institute for Virus Research, Kyoto University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/chemistry/*genetics', 'Genes, Dominant', 'Genetic Linkage', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/etiology/*genetics', 'Models, Biological', '*Point Mutation', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Transcription Factors/chemistry/*genetics']",2001/11/28 10:00,2002/09/26 06:00,['2001/11/28 10:00'],"['2001/11/28 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/26 06:00 [medline]', '2001/11/28 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2001 Oct;74(3):245-51. doi: 10.1007/BF02982056.,,['10.1007/BF02982056 [doi]'],,20,,,,,,,,,,

Following nerve injury, its expression is rapidly increased in the nerve at the injury site and promotes both sensory and motor neuron survival. Once normal nerve function is restored, LIF expression returns to negligible levels. For this reason, LIF is considered to be a peripheral nerve trauma factor. We wished to determine whether LIF is also upregulated in human nerves following trauma and whether it is expressed in neuromas of varying age. Immunohistochemical staining for the presence of LIF was performed on injured and control human nerves from a number of subjects. Results demonstrate that LIF expression is increased in nerves within hours of injury and, in the case of neuroma formation, can persist for several years. LIF immunoreactivity was consistently found in Schwann cells, in peripheral nerve axons, and, at stages when an inflammatory response was present, also in neutrophils, mast cells, macrophages, and blood vessel walls. The level of staining within the connective tissue of injured nerves was elevated compared to control nerves, which may be due to the presence of LIF bound to the soluble secreted form of the LIF receptor. Whether the continued expression of LIF is unhealed injured nerves promotes the development of neuromas remains to be resolved.","['Dowsing, B J', 'Romeo, R', 'Morrison, W A']","['Dowsing BJ', 'Romeo R', 'Morrison WA']","[""Bernard O'Brien Institute of Microsurgery, St. Vincent's Hospital, Melbourne, Australia.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Neurotrauma,Journal of neurotrauma,8811626,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (LIFR protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)']",IM,,"['Axons/pathology', 'Growth Inhibitors/*biosynthesis', 'Hand Injuries/pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Vitro Techniques', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit', 'Lymphokines/*biosynthesis', 'Nerve Crush', 'Neuroma/metabolism', '*Peripheral Nerve Injuries', 'Peripheral Nerves/*metabolism', 'Peripheral Nervous System Neoplasms/metabolism', 'Receptors, Cytokine/metabolism', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF', 'Up-Regulation']",2001/11/28 10:00,2002/05/03 10:01,['2001/11/28 10:00'],"['2001/11/28 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/05/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/28 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Neurotrauma. 2001 Nov;18(11):1279-87. doi: 10.1089/089771501317095313.,,['10.1089/089771501317095313 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: ATRA combined with chemotherapy can decrease the incidence of retinoic acid syndrome and produce a very high remission rate (90%-95%). Post-remission treatment should include chemotherapy and ATRA, the 5-year survival probability was able to attain 0.71 +/- 0.06. The main problem in the treatment is early tolerance to ATRA and relapse of the disease. The most effective treatments for relapsed APL is to use arsenic trioxide.

METHODS: Expression of Evi-1 and MDS1-Evi-1 genes was examined in 31 MDS, 11 post-MDS AML, and 34 de novo AML patients by a semi-quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RESULTS: Evi-1 expression was not detected in bone marrow samples of 8 normal controls, but low MDS1-Evi-1 expression levels (MDS1-Evi-1/GAPDH < 0.1) were detected in 3 of the 8 controls. Evi-1 RNA was expressed in 1 of 8 RA, 8 of 13 RAEB and 6 of 9 RAEB-T patients, and the percentage of Evi-1 expression in RAEB(T) patients was higher than that in RA (P < 0.05). MDS1-Evi-1 expression was detected in 5 of 8 RA, 9 of 13 RAEB and 5 of 9 RAEB-T patients, and MDS1-Evi-1 expression levels (MDS1-Evi-1/GAPDH > 0.1) were markedly higher than those in the controls. Evi-1 expression was gradually increased in 4 of 5 RAEB-T patients with transformation from MDS to AML. The percentages of Evi-1 and MDS1-Evi-1 expression in post-MDS AML patients were significantly (P < 0.01 and P < 0.05 respectively) higher than those in de novo AML. The colonies of hematopoietic progenitor cells were decreased in Evi-1 and MDS1-Evi-1-positive MDS patients as compared with those in Evi-1 and MDS1-Evi-1-negative patients.

Meanwhile, granulocyte-colony-stimulating-factor(G-CSF), interferon gamma and tumor necrosis factor(TNF) activities in the patient serum and supernate of NB4 cell culture were detected. RESULTS: Before treatment, there was an inhibitory activity on CFU-GM growth in the sera of APL patients and it was statistically higher than that in remission patients and controls(P < 0.01). As the treatment going on the activity was gradually increased, reached its maximum 3-6 days prior to the peak of white blood cell(WBC) and declined to normal when bone marrow remission was obtained.

Control group included 61 HLA-matched Allo-BMTs with ABO compatible grafts. The major ABO incompatible patients received marrow grafts depleted of erythrocytes by hydroxyethyl starch (HES) sedimentation. The minor or bidirectional received marrow grafts depleted of plasma to reduce anti-A or anti-B agglutinins. ABO antigen and antibody in the recipients sera were determined once a week. RESULTS: ABO-incompatible grafts for BMT had no adverse effect on engraftment, recovery of platelets, incidence of GVHD or survival. No recipient developed clinically hemolysis during or after marrow infusion. In ABO major compatible group, the onset of erythropoiesis after BMT was delayed and more RBC transfusions were required. Five of 10 recipients with blood group ""O"" in this group developed pure red cell aplasia (PRCA), lasting 7-24 months. Two of them recovered without therapeutic intervention.

The distinct regulation of TF and PCA on APL cells by As2O3 and DNR may at least partially contribute to their effects on APL coagulopathy through the influence on coagulant factors activation.","['Guo, W', 'Zhu, J', 'Wang, H']","['Guo W', 'Zhu J', 'Wang H']","['Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Second Medical University, Shanghai 200025.']",['chi'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi = Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi,8212398,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '9001-27-8 (Factor VIII)', '9035-58-9 (Thromboplastin)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,,"['Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Daunorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Factor VIII/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Thromboplastin/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/11/28 10:00,2002/03/01 10:01,['2001/11/28 10:00'],"['2001/11/28 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/01 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/28 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 1999 Sep;20(9):453-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Trypan blue exclusion was used for cell counts, and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis for oligodeoxynucleotides. RESULTS: The synthesized 18 bp phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides was stable, resistant to nuclease, and no unspecific effects. Both STAS and FUAS could inhibit the NB4 cell growth in a dose-dependent manner. Low concentration (20 micrograms/ml) of STAS or FUAS resulted in growth inhibition of 0%-11.3%, and the highest inhibition was found at concentration of 80 micrograms/ml (inhibition rate 50.0%-67.7%).

METHODS: K562, U937, HL-60 cell lines, leukemic blast from 8 acute myeloid leukemia patients and normal bone marrow cells from 8 healthy subjects were treated in vitro with WT1 antisense oligonucleotide (WT1 ASO) targeting to the translation site of WT1 mRNA. The inhibitory effect on growth of leukemia cells was measured by Trypan blue exclusion and colony-forming unit assay. Apoptosis was measured by flow cytometric analysis and DNA fragmentation assay. RESULTS: WT1 ASO significantly inhibited the proliferation of K562 cells expressing WT1 and leukemic blast of 4 in 8 acute myeloid leukemia patients, but didn't inhibit the growth of U937 cells which had no WT1 expression and CFU-GM of normal marrow cells from 8 healthy subjects. Whereas WT1 sense oligonucleotide (WT1 SO) had no effect on the proliferation of K562 cells, U937 cells and the CFU-GM of normal marrow cells. WT1 ASO could induce apoptosis of K562 cells and the level of apoptosis was increased markedly when combined with Vp16; WT1 ASO alone couldn't induce apoptosis of HL-60 cells, but could increase the apoptosis when combined with Vp16. CONCLUSION: WT1 ASO specifically inhibit the growth of leukemic cells, induce apoptosis of K562 cells and increase the apoptosis susceptibility of leukemia cells to Vp16. WT1 plays an important role in proliferation and apoptosis of leukemic cells.","['Wu, X', 'Wang, Y', 'Pei, X']","['Wu X', 'Wang Y', 'Pei X']","['General Hospital of PLA, Beijing 100853.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",China,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi = Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi,8212398,"['0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)']",IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Blast Crisis', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Genes, Wilms Tumor', 'HL-60 Cells/pathology', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'U937 Cells/pathology', 'WT1 Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics']",2001/11/28 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/11/28 10:00'],"['2001/11/28 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/28 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 1999 Dec;20(12):631-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The methylation of p15 gene CpG islands in bone marrow from 40 cases of newly diagnosed or relapsed AL, 5 cases of AL in CR and 8 of normal subjects was analyzed by using methylation-specific PCR methods(MSP), and the product of MSP was sequenced. RESULTS: p15 gene CpG islands were methylated in 80% (32/40) of the newly diagnosed or relapsed AL, no difference between AML and ALL was observed. One positive result was found in the 5 AL patients in CR and this patient soon relapsed. The bone marrow cells from 8 normal subjects did not have p15 gene CpG islands methylation, which suggested that such methylation was peculiar to AL cells. DNA sequencing confirmed the right expected sequence. The sensitivity of MSP was 10(-3). CONCLUSION: The methylation of p15 gene CpG islands occurs very commonly in every types of AL. It can be used as a gene marker for ALs and for minimal residual disease in CR. MSP needs neither special methylation-sensitive restricted sites, nor high volume of DNA. There is no radioactive pollution, and the sample need not be fresh. MSP is a very sensitive, simple and specific method for the detection of DNA methylation.","['Zhang, Y', 'Lou, F', 'Yu, L']","['Zhang Y', 'Lou F', 'Yu L']","['Department of Hematology, General Hospital of PLA, Beijing 100853.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",China,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi = Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi,8212398,"['0 (CDKN2B protein, human)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)']",IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', '*Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Child', 'CpG Islands/*genetics', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15', 'DNA Methylation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', '*Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",2001/11/28 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/11/28 10:00'],"['2001/11/28 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/28 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 1999 Dec;20(12):628-30.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although large epidemiologic studies have not identified an elevated cancer risk in persons who received SV40-contaminated vaccines, fragments of SV40 DNA have recently been identified in certain human tumours. We report the follow-up of a cohort of 1073 persons, unique because they received SV40-contaminated poliovirus vaccines as newborns in 1961-63. A previous report of the status of these subjects as of 1977-79 identified 15 deaths, none due to cancer. The present study utilized the National Death Index to identify deaths in the cohort for the years 1979-96. Expected deaths were calculated from Cleveland area sex-, age-, race- and year-specific mortality rates. Increased mortality from all causes was not found. 4 deaths from cancer were found compared to 3.16 expected (P = 0.77). However, 2 deaths from testicular cancer occurred, compared to 0.05 expected (P = 0.002), which may be a chance finding due to multiple comparisons. There were 2 deaths due to leukaemia, a non-significant finding, and no deaths due to tumours of the types putatively associated with SV40. Although these results are, for the most part, consistent with other negative epidemiologic investigations of risks from SV40-contaminated vaccines, further study of testicular cancer may be warranted, and it will be important to continue monitoring this cohort which is now reaching middle-age.","['Carroll-Pankhurst, C', 'Engels, E A', 'Strickler, H D', 'Goedert, J J', 'Wagner, J', 'Mortimer, E A Jr']","['Carroll-Pankhurst C', 'Engels EA', 'Strickler HD', 'Goedert JJ', 'Wagner J', 'Mortimer EA Jr']","['Mandel School of Applied Social Sciences, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, 44106-7164, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,['0 (Poliovirus Vaccines)'],IM,,"['Adult', 'Cohort Studies', '*Drug Contamination', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/epidemiology/*etiology/mortality', 'Male', 'Mortality/*trends', 'Poliovirus Vaccines/*adverse effects', 'Risk Factors', 'Simian virus 40/*pathogenicity', 'Testicular Neoplasms/epidemiology/*etiology/mortality']",2001/11/27 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/11/27 10:00'],"['2001/11/27 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/27 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 2001 Nov 2;85(9):1295-7. doi: 10.1054/bjoc.2001.2065.,,"['10.1054/bjoc.2001.2065 [doi]', 'S0007092001920658 [pii]']",,,,['Copyright 2001 Cancer Research Campaign'],,,PMC2375249,,,,,

Multiparameter flow cytometric analysis of bone marrow cells demonstrated coexpression of the EPO receptor with CD45 and CD13 on the surface of blasts. The incubation of marrow cells with EPO, compared to without, resulted in 1.3- and 1.6-fold increases, respectively, in tritiated thymidine incorporation and bromodeoxyuridine incorporation into CD13(+) cells. Clinical and laboratory findings were consistent with the EPO-dependent transformation of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) to AML.

This study shows that MHC-incompatible cells can engraft stably after nonmyeloablative conditioning with immunosuppressive chemotherapy and low-dose total body irradiation (TBI). Long-term mixed hematopoietic chimerism, clonal deletion of donor-reactive T cells, and bidirectional cytotoxic T-cell tolerance were achieved by transplanting MHC-mismatched marrow cells into recipients conditioned with pretransplantation fludarabine or cyclophosphamide (Cy), 50 to 200 cGy TBI on day -1, and Cy 200 mg/kg intraperitoneally on day 3. In this model, long-term donor chimerism was proportional to the dose of TBI or donor marrow cells. Pretransplantation fludarabine and posttransplantation Cy were both required for alloengraftment, but the drugs had additional effects. For example, fludarabine sensitized host stem cells to the toxicity of TBI, because animals conditioned with both agents had higher chimerism than animals conditioned with TBI alone (P <.05). Also, posttransplantation Cy attenuated lethal and nonlethal GVH reactions, because F(1) recipients of host-reactive, parental spleen cells survived longer (P <.05) and had lower donor cell chimerism (P <.01) if they received posttransplantation Cy than if they did not. Finally, delayed infusions of donor lymphocytes into mixed chimeras prolonged survival after leukemia challenge (P <.0001) without causing lethal GVHD. These results indicate that stable engraftment of MHC-incompatible cells can be induced after fludarabine-based, nonmyeloablative conditioning and that it serves as a platform for adoptive immunotherapy with donor lymphocyte infusions.","['Luznik, L', 'Jalla, S', 'Engstrom, L W', 'Iannone, R', 'Fuchs, E J']","['Luznik L', 'Jalla S', 'Engstrom LW', 'Iannone R', 'Fuchs EJ']","['Division of Hematopoiesis, Hematologic Malignancies, and Pediatric Oncology, Johns Hopkins Oncology Center, Baltimore, MD, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,['Acta Haematol. 2016;135(4):211-6.

However, by molecular cloning of t(2;14)(p13;q32.3) from 3 cases of aggressive B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/immunocytoma, this study has shown clustered breakpoints on chromosome 2p13 immediately upstream of a CpG island located about 300 kb telomeric of REL. This CpG island was associated with a Kruppel zinc finger gene (BCL11A), which is normally expressed at high levels only in fetal brain and in germinal center B-cells. There were 3 major RNA isoforms of BCL11A, differing in the number of carboxy-terminal zinc fingers. All 3 RNA isoforms were deregulated as a consequence of t(2;14)(p13;q32.3). BCL11A was highly conserved, being 95% identical to mouse, chicken, and Xenopus homologues. BCL11A was also highly homologous to another gene (BCL11B) on chromosome 14q32.1.

Leukemic blasts expressing MLL/AF4 are arrested at an early progenitor stage with lymphoid or monocytoid characteristics. A novel B-lineage ALL cell line termed B-lineage-3 (BLIN-3) requiring human bone marrow (BM) stromal cell contact and interleukin-7 (IL-7) for optimal proliferation has been established. BLIN-3 cells have a CD19(+)/CD10(-) phenotype typical of infant ALL, and they harbor the t(4;11)(q21;q23) chromosomal translocation. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis confirmed the presence of the MLL/AF4 fusion mRNA and protein in BLIN-3. Initial BLIN-3 cultures had a pro-B cell phenotype and did not express cytoplasmic or surface mu heavy chain. After approximately 5 months in culture on BM stromal cells plus IL-7, BLIN-3 sublines emerged expressing mu heavy chain and VpreB on the cell surfaces (ie, pre-B-cell receptor [BCR](+)). BLIN-3 cells expressing pre-BCR had the t(4;11)(q21;q23) translocation and expressed the MLL/AF4 fusion protein. Cross-linking the BLIN-3 pre-BCR led to enhanced cell proliferation, demonstrating that BLIN-3 expressed a functional pre-BCR. Increased acquisition of surface pre-BCR in BLIN-3 sublines was associated with loss of DJ rearrangements and the appearance of VDJ rearrangements. These results indicate that expression of the MLL/AF4 fusion protein is compatible with BM stromal cell and cytokine dependency, functional immunoglobulin gene segment rearrangement, and subsequent expression of a potentially diverse antigen receptor repertoire. Thus, the expression of MLL/AF4 is compatible with the normal developmental program of human B-lineage cells.","['Bertrand, F E', 'Vogtenhuber, C', 'Shah, N', 'LeBien, T W']","['Bertrand FE', 'Vogtenhuber C', 'Shah N', 'LeBien TW']","['University of Minnesota Cancer Center and the Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Minneapolis 55455, USA. bertr010@tc.umn.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Cross-Linking Reagents)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Light Chains)', '0 (Interleukin-7)', '0 (MLL-AF4 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)']",IM,,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', 'B-Lymphocytes/*pathology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/physiology', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Survival', 'Cross-Linking Reagents', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Light Chains/analysis', 'Infant', 'Interleukin-7/pharmacology', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/*pathology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Stromal Cells/physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/11/24 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/11/24 10:00'],"['2001/11/24 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/24 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2001 Dec 1;98(12):3398-405. doi: 10.1182/blood.v98.12.3398.,,"['10.1182/blood.v98.12.3398 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)56793-1 [pii]']",,,,,,"['R01 CA31685/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA76055/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,

TEL/PDGFbetaR mutants have been generated that contain tyrosine-to-phenylalanine (Tyr-->Phe) substitutions at phosphorylation sites present in the native PDGFbetaR to assess the role of these sites in cell transformation by TEL/PDGFbetaR. Similar to previous findings in a murine bone marrow transplantation model, full transformation of Ba/F3 cells to IL-3-independent survival and proliferation required the TEL/PDGFbetaR juxtamembrane and carboxy terminal phosphorylation sites. In contrast to previous reports concerning comparable mutants in the native PDGFbetaR, each of the TEL/PDGFbetaR mutants is fully active as a protein-tyrosine kinase. Expression of the TEL/PDGFbetaR fusion protein causes hyperphosphorylation and activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT5), and this activation of STAT5 requires the juxtamembrane Tyr579 and Tyr581 in the TEL/PDGFbetaR fusion. Hyperphosphosphorylation of phospholipase Cgamma (PLCgamma) and the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) requires the carboxy terminal tyrosine residues of TEL/PDGFbetaR. Thus, full transformation of Ba/F3 cells by TEL/PDGFbetaR requires engagement of PI3K and PLCgamma and activation of STAT5. Taken together with the growth properties of cells transformed by the TEL/PDGFbetaR variants, these findings indicate that a minimal combination of these signaling intermediates contributes to hematopoietic transformation by the wild-type TEL/PDGFbetaR fusion.

This study investigates the sensitivity of freshly isolated cells obtained from 33 patients with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL), 5 patients with prolymphocytic leukemia (PLL), and 6 patients with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) to be lysed by rituximab and complement in vitro. The results showed that in B-CLL and PLL, the levels of CD20, measured by standard immunofluorescence or using calibrated beads, correlated linearly with the lytic response (coefficient greater than or equal to 0.9; P <.0001). Furthermore, the correlation remained highly significant when the 6 patients with MCL were included in the analysis (coefficient 0.91; P <.0001), which suggests that CD20 levels primarily determine lysis regardless of diagnostic group. The role of the complement inhibitors CD46, CD55, and CD59 was also investigated. All B-CLL and PLL cells expressed these molecules, but at different levels. CD46 was relatively weak on all samples (mean fluorescence intensity less than 100), whereas CD55 and CD59 showed variability of expression (mean fluorescence intensity 20-1200 and 20-250, respectively). Although CD55 and CD59 levels did not permit prediction of complement susceptibility, the functional block of these inhibitors demonstrated that they play an important role in regulating complement-dependent cytotoxicity. Thus, lysis of poorly responding B-CLL samples was increased 5- to 6-fold after blocking both CD55 and CD59, whereas that of high responders was essentially complete in the presence of a single blocking antibody. These data demonstrate that CD20, CD55, and CD59 are important factors determining the in vitro response to rituximab and complement and indicate potential strategies to improve the clinical response to this biologic therapy.","['Golay, J', 'Lazzari, M', 'Facchinetti, V', 'Bernasconi, S', 'Borleri, G', 'Barbui, T', 'Rambaldi, A', 'Introna, M']","['Golay J', 'Lazzari M', 'Facchinetti V', 'Bernasconi S', 'Borleri G', 'Barbui T', 'Rambaldi A', 'Introna M']","['Laboratory of Molecular Immunohematology, Istituto Ricerche Farmacologiche Mario Negri, Milano, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antigens, CD20)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CD55 Antigens)', '0 (CD59 Antigens)', '0 (Complement C3)', '0 (Complement C9)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', '9007-36-7 (Complement System Proteins)']",IM,,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived', 'Antigens, CD20/*analysis', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'CD55 Antigens/analysis/*immunology', 'CD59 Antigens/analysis/*immunology', 'Cell Death', 'Complement C3/analysis', 'Complement C9/analysis', 'Complement System Proteins/*immunology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology/*therapy', 'Leukemia, Prolymphocytic/immunology', 'Rituximab', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology']",2001/11/24 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/11/24 10:00'],"['2001/11/24 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/24 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2001 Dec 1;98(12):3383-9. doi: 10.1182/blood.v98.12.3383.,,"['10.1182/blood.v98.12.3383 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)56791-8 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Strategies to control GVHD while maintaining graft versus leukemia (GVL) include herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV-tk) gene transduction of donor T cells followed by treatment with ganciclovir (GCV). Alternatively, GVHD and GVL may be mediated by distinct processes. In this regard, whether cytokine polarization occurs and to what degrees various subsets of cytokine-producing T cells mediate GVHD or GVL has been an active area of research using cytokine or cytokine antibody infusion or genetically deficient mice. This study takes a different approach that allows simultaneous investigation into both the mechanisms underlying GVHD reactions and the efficacy of HSV-tk suicide gene-based T-cell deletion. A source of donor T cells, splenocytes from mice transgenic for HSV-tk controlled by elements of either the interleukin-2 (IL-2) or IL-4 promoters (IL-2-tk and IL-4-tk, respectively) was used, thus allowing investigation into the roles of T1 and T2 cells in ongoing GVHD reactions. To assess treatment rather than prevention of GVHD, GCV was started at peak disease. Remarkably, treatment at this late time point rescued mice from the clinical effects of GVHD caused by T cells expressing either transgene. Thus, both T1 and T2 cells play an important role in clinical GVHD in a minor histocompatibility antigen-mismatched setting. In addition, because clinical disease was reversible even at its maximum, these observations provide controlled evidence that this strategy of treating ongoing GVHD could be effective clinically.","['Liu, J', 'Anderson, B E', 'Robert, M E', 'McNiff, J M', 'Emerson, S G', 'Shlomchik, W D', 'Shlomchik, M J']","['Liu J', 'Anderson BE', 'Robert ME', 'McNiff JM', 'Emerson SG', 'Shlomchik WD', 'Shlomchik MJ']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT 06520-8035, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', 'EC 2.7.1.21 (Thymidine Kinase)', 'P9G3CKZ4P5 (Ganciclovir)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Cell Death/genetics', 'Cytokines/biosynthesis/metabolism', '*Disease Models, Animal', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Ganciclovir/therapeutic use', 'Graft vs Host Disease/drug therapy/*immunology/pathology', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/immunology', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/physiology', 'Interleukin-2/genetics', 'Interleukin-4/genetics', 'Lymphocyte Subsets/*immunology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Simplexvirus/enzymology', 'Spleen/cytology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Thymidine Kinase/genetics', 'Thymus Gland/cytology', 'Weight Gain']",2001/11/24 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/11/24 10:00'],"['2001/11/24 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/24 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2001 Dec 1;98(12):3367-75. doi: 10.1182/blood.v98.12.3367.,,"['10.1182/blood.v98.12.3367 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)56789-X [pii]']",,,,,,"['K08-HL03979/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50HL54516/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,

Translation of this approach for preventing leukemia relapse after bone marrow transplantation might require ex vivo priming and long-term maintenance of leukemia blast-specific T cells. To accomplish this goal, procedures were optimized for the in vitro priming of naive CD8 using dendritic cells activated by CD40 ligation, interleukin-12 (IL-12), and IL-7. Using T lymphocytes and dendritic cells obtained from HLA-matched allogeneic bone marrow transplantation donors and leukemia blasts as a source of tumor antigens, anti-acute myeloid leukemia cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) were induced. In these experiments, it was found that though it is possible to induce CTLs using immature dendritic cells, IL-12, and IL-7, obtaining long-term CTLs requires the presence of CD4 T cells in the priming phase. Using this approach, long-term antileukemia CTL lines could be generated from 4 of 4 bone marrow donors.

Among these is H0XA10, which is selectively expressed at high levels in the most primitive subpopulation of human CD34(+) bone marrow cells. When overexpressed, H0XA10 increases the proliferation of early progenitor cells and can lead to the development of myeloid leukemia. To study the effects of H0XA10 on primitive hematopoietic progenitors in more detail, transgenic mice were generated with regulatable H0XA10 expression. The transgenic mouse model, referred to as tetO-HOXA10, contains the H0XA10 gene controlled by a tetracycline-responsive element and a minimal promoter. Thus, the expression of H0XA10 is inducible and reversible depending on the absence or presence of tetracycline or its analog, doxycycline. A retroviral vector containing the tetracycline transactivator gene (tTA) was used to induce expression of the H0XA10 gene in bone marrow cells from the transgenic mice. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis confirmed regulatable H0XA10 expression in several transgenic lines. H0XA10 induction led to the formation of hematopoietic colonies containing blastlike cells and megakaryocytes. Moreover, the induction of H0XA10 resulted in significant proliferative advantage of primitive hematopoietic progenitors (spleen colony-forming units [CFU-S(12)]), which was reversible on withdrawal of induction. Activation of H0XA10 expression in tet0-H0XA10 mice will therefore govern proliferation of primitive myeloid progenitors in a regulated fashion. This novel animal model can be used to identify the target genes of HOXA10 and better clarify the specific role of HOXA10 in normal and malignant hematopoiesis.","['Bjornsson, J M', 'Andersson, E', 'Lundstrom, P', 'Larsson, N', 'Xu, X', 'Repetowska, E', 'Humphries, R K', 'Karlsson, S']","['Bjornsson JM', 'Andersson E', 'Lundstrom P', 'Larsson N', 'Xu X', 'Repetowska E', 'Humphries RK', 'Karlsson S']","['Molecular Medicine and Gene Therapy, Institute of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University Hospital, Lund, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Homeobox A10 Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '164384-16-1 (Hoxa10 protein, mouse)', 'F8VB5M810T (Tetracycline)', 'N12000U13O (Doxycycline)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/analysis', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology/drug effects/immunology', 'Cell Division/*drug effects', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*pharmacology/physiology', 'Doxycycline/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes, Homeobox', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*drug effects', 'Homeobox A10 Proteins', '*Homeodomain Proteins', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/etiology', 'Megakaryocytes/cytology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred CBA', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Models, Animal', 'Response Elements/drug effects', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tetracycline/pharmacology']",2001/11/24 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/11/24 10:00'],"['2001/11/24 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/24 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2001 Dec 1;98(12):3301-8. doi: 10.1182/blood.v98.12.3301.,,"['10.1182/blood.v98.12.3301 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)56780-3 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

One form of APL is associated with the translocation t(11;17), which joins the promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF) and retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARalpha) genes. Because PLZF is coexpressed in the myeloid lineage with the vitamin D(3) receptor (VDR), the interplay between PLZF and VDR was examined. It was found that PLZF interacts directly with VDR. This occurred at least partly through contacts in the DNA-binding domain of VDR and the broad complex, tram-trak, bric-a-brac/pox virus zinc finger (BTB/POZ) domain of PLZF. Moreover, PLZF altered the mobility of VDR derived from nuclear extracts when bound to its cognate binding site, forming a slowly migrating DNA-protein complex. Overexpression of PLZF in a monocytic cell line abrogated 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) activation from both a minimal VDR responsive reporter and the promoter of p21(WAF1/CIP1), a target gene of VDR. Deletion of the BTB/POZ domain significantly relieved PLZF-mediated repression of 1,25(OH)(2)D(3)-dependent activation. In addition, stable, inducible expression of PLZF in U937 cells inhibited the ability of 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) to induce surface expression of the monocytic marker CD14 and morphologic changes associated with differentiation. These results suggest that PLZF may play an important role in regulating the process by which 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) induces monocytic differentiation in hematopoietic cells.","['Ward, J O', 'McConnell, M J', 'Carlile, G W', 'Pandolfi, P P', 'Licht, J D', 'Freedman, L P']","['Ward JO', 'McConnell MJ', 'Carlile GW', 'Pandolfi PP', 'Licht JD', 'Freedman LP']","['Programs of Cell Biology and Human Genetics, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (Receptors, Calcitriol)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '147855-37-6 (ZBTB16 protein, human)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']",IM,,"['Binding Sites', 'Calcitriol/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Nucleus/chemistry', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'Cyclins/genetics', 'DNA/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse', 'Monocytes/*drug effects', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein', 'Receptors, Calcitriol/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Transfection', 'U937 Cells', 'Zinc Fingers']",2001/11/24 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/11/24 10:00'],"['2001/11/24 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/24 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2001 Dec 1;98(12):3290-300. doi: 10.1182/blood.v98.12.3290.,,"['10.1182/blood.v98.12.3290 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)56779-7 [pii]']",,,,,,"['CA59936/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK52621/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,

It has been shown that expression of an activated form of Notch1 (aNotch1) in 32D mouse myeloid progenitor cells inhibits the granulocytic differentiation induced by granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). Results of the current study show that aNotch1, when expressed in F5-5 mouse erythroleukemia cells, also inhibits erythroid differentiation. Comparison of the expression levels of several transcription factors after stimulation for myeloid and erythroid differentiation, in the presence or absence of aNotch1, revealed that aNotch1 did not change its regulation pattern with any of the transcription factors examined, except for GATA-2, despite its inhibitory effect on differentiation. GATA-2 was down-regulated when the parental 32D and F5-5 were induced to differentiate into granulocytic and erythroid lineages, respectively. In these induction procedures, however, the level of GATA-2 expression was sustained when aNotch1 was expressed. To ascertain whether maintenance of GATA-2 is required for the Notch-induced inhibition of differentiation, the dominant-negative form of GATA-3 (DN-GATA), which acted also against GATA-2, or transcription factor PU.1, which was recently shown to be the repressor of GATA-2, was introduced into aNotch1-expressing 32D (32D/aNotch1) cells that do not express GATA family proteins other than GATA2. Both DN-GATA and PU.1 reversed the phenotype of 32D/aNotch1 inducing its differentiation when G-CSF was added. Furthermore, enforced expression of HES-1, which is involved in Notch signaling, delayed differentiation of 32D, and again this phenotype was neutralized by DN-GATA. These results indicate that GATA-2 activity is necessary for the Notch signaling in hematopoietic cells.","['Kumano, K', 'Chiba, S', 'Shimizu, K', 'Yamagata, T', 'Hosoya, N', 'Saito, T', 'Takahashi, T', 'Hamada, Y', 'Hirai, H']","['Kumano K', 'Chiba S', 'Shimizu K', 'Yamagata T', 'Hosoya N', 'Saito T', 'Takahashi T', 'Hamada Y', 'Hirai H']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (GATA2 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA2 protein, human)', '0 (Gata2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Hes1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (NOTCH1 protein, human)', '0 (Notch1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factor HES-1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (proto-oncogene protein Spi-1)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '149348-15-2 (HES1 protein, human)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Erythrocytes/cytology', 'GATA2 Transcription Factor', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Granulocytes/*cytology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Phenotype', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/pharmacology', 'Receptor, Notch1', '*Receptors, Cell Surface', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Trans-Activators/pharmacology', 'Transcription Factor HES-1', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/11/24 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/11/24 10:00'],"['2001/11/24 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/24 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2001 Dec 1;98(12):3283-9. doi: 10.1182/blood.v98.12.3283.,,"['10.1182/blood.v98.12.3283 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)56778-5 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

A total of 226 patients were randomly assigned to sequential treatment with cytarabine and infusional DNR with or without intravenous CsA. Remitting patients received one course of consolidation chemotherapy that included DNR with or without CsA as assigned during induction. Addition of CsA significantly reduced the frequency of resistance to induction chemotherapy (31% versus 47%, P =.0077).

The effect of CsA on survival was greatest in patients with moderate or bright Pgp expression (median 12 months with CsA versus 4 months for controls) compared to patients with absent or low Pgp expression (median 6 months in both arms). The frequency of induction deaths was 15% with CsA and 18% in controls.

Allogeneic stem cell transplantation, though often curative, is associated with high nonrelapse mortality and long-term morbidity, particularly when cells from unrelated donors are used. Many physicians and patients opt for a trial of interferon-alpha (IFN)-based therapy first, reserving transplantation for patients with inadequate response or intolerance to IFN. Data were analyzed on 740 patients receiving unrelated donor transplants for chronic myelogenous leukemia in first chronic phase provided by the International Bone Marrow Transplant Registry and the National Marrow Donor Program to see whether IFN pretreatment compromised transplantation outcome. A total of 489 (66%) had received IFN prior to transplantation; 251 (34%) had not. Disease characteristics in the 2 groups were similar at diagnosis but at the time of transplantation, hematologic parameters and weight were lower in IFN patients and the interval between diagnosis and transplantation was longer. After adjustment for baseline covariates, no effect of IFN exposure was found on overall survival, leukemia-free survival, nonrelapse mortality, engraftment, relapse, or acute or chronic graft-versus-host disease. Evaluation of effects based on duration of therapy and time off IFN prior to transplantation was limited by missing data and confounding with IFN intolerance and disease responsiveness. In conclusion, no evidence was found for an independent adverse effect of IFN pretreatment on the outcome of subsequent unrelated donor transplantation.","['Lee, S J', 'Klein, J P', 'Anasetti, C', 'Antin, J H', 'Loberiza, F R', 'Bolwell, B J', 'LeMaistre, C F', 'Litzow, M R', 'Marks, D', 'Waller, E K', 'Matlack, M', 'Giralt, S', 'Horowitz, M M']","['Lee SJ', 'Klein JP', 'Anasetti C', 'Antin JH', 'Loberiza FR', 'Bolwell BJ', 'LeMaistre CF', 'Litzow MR', 'Marks D', 'Waller EK', 'Matlack M', 'Giralt S', 'Horowitz MM']","['Chronic Leukemia Working Committee of the International Bone Marrow Transplant Registry, Health Policy Institute, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI 53226, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '9008-11-1 (Interferons)']",IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antibodies, Viral/blood', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cytomegalovirus/immunology', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/epidemiology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Interferons/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recurrence', 'Registries', 'Survival Rate', 'Time Factors', '*Treatment Outcome']",2001/11/24 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/11/24 10:00'],"['2001/11/24 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/24 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2001 Dec 1;98(12):3205-11. doi: 10.1182/blood.v98.12.3205.,,"['10.1182/blood.v98.12.3205 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)56768-2 [pii]']",,,,,,"['CA75267-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24-CA76518/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,

It was hypothesized that the use of G-CSF to prime bone marrow (G-BM) would allow rapid engraftment without increased risk for GVHD compared with G-PBSC. Patients were randomized to receive G-BM or G-PBSCs for allogeneic stem cell transplantation. The study was designed (beta <.8) to detect a difference in the incidence of chronic GVHD of 33% (alpha <.05). The plan was to recruit 100 patients and to conduct an interim analysis when the 6-month follow-up point was reached for the first 50 patients. Fifty-seven consecutive patients were recruited (G-BM, n = 28; G-PBSC, n = 29). Patients in the G-PBSC group received 3-fold more CD34(+) and 9-fold more CD3(+) cells. Median times to neutrophil (G-BM, 16 days; G-PBSC, 14 days; P <.1) and platelet engraftment (G-BM, 14 days; G-PBSC, 12 days; P <.1) were similar. The use of G-PBSC was associated with steroid refractory acute GVHD (G-BM, 0%; G-PBSC, 32%; P <.001), chronic GVHD (G-BM, 22%; G-PBSC, 80%; P <.02), and prolonged requirement for immunosuppressive therapy (G-BM, 173 days; G-PBSC, 680 days; P <.009). Survival was similar for the 2 groups. Compared with G-PBSC, the use of G-BM resulted in comparable engraftment, reduced severity of acute GVHD, and less subsequent chronic GVHD.","['Morton, J', 'Hutchins, C', 'Durrant, S']","['Morton J', 'Hutchins C', 'Durrant S']","['Bone Marrow Transplant Unit, Royal Brisbane Hospital, Herston, Australia. james_morton@health.qld.gov.au']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antigens, CD34/analysis', 'Blood Platelets/physiology', '*Bone Marrow Cells', 'CD3 Complex/analysis', 'Cell Count', 'Chronic Disease', 'Graft Survival', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*prevention & control', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*administration & dosage', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cells/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/mortality/therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/mortality/therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutrophils/physiology', 'Recurrence', 'Survival Rate', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2001/11/24 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/11/24 10:00'],"['2001/11/24 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/24 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2001 Dec 1;98(12):3186-91. doi: 10.1182/blood.v98.12.3186.,,"['10.1182/blood.v98.12.3186 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)56766-9 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Identifying cellular partners that interact with Tax constitutes the first step toward elucidating the molecular basis of Tax-induced transformation. Here, we report a novel Tax-interacting protein, hTid-1. hTid-1, a human homolog of the Drosophila tumor suppressor protein Tid56, was initially characterized based on its interaction with the HPV-16 E7 oncoprotein [2]. hTid-1 and Tid56 are members of the DnaJ family [2,3], which contains a highly conserved signature J domain that regulates the activities of heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) by serving as cochaperone [4-6]. In this context, the molecular chaperone complex is involved in cellular signaling pathways linked to apoptosis, protein folding, and membrane translocation and in modulation of the activities of tumor suppressor proteins, including retinoblastoma, p53, and WT1[7-12]. We find that expression of hTid-1 inhibits the transformation phenotype of two human lung adenocarcinoma cell lines. We show that Tax interacts with hTid-1 via a central cysteine-rich domain of hTid-1 while a signature J domain of hTid-1 mediates its binding to Hsp70 in HEK cells. Importantly, Tax associates with the molecular chaperone complex containing both hTid-1 and Hsp70 and alters the cellular localization of hTid-1 and Hsp70. In the absence of Tax, expression of the hTid-1/Hsp70 molecular complex is targeted to perinuclear mitochondrial clusters. In the presence of Tax, hTid-1 and its associated Hsp70 are sequestered within a cytoplasmic ""hot spot"" structure, a subcellular distribution that is characteristic of Tax in HEK cells.","['Cheng, H', 'Cenciarelli, C', 'Shao, Z', 'Vidal, M', 'Parks, W P', 'Pagano, M', 'Cheng-Mayer, C']","['Cheng H', 'Cenciarelli C', 'Shao Z', 'Vidal M', 'Parks WP', 'Pagano M', 'Cheng-Mayer C']","['Departments of Pediatrics, New York University School of Medicine, New York, NY 10016, USA. hcheng@adarc.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Curr Biol,Current biology : CB,9107782,"['0 (DNAJA3 protein, human)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (HSP40 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Molecular Chaperones)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)']",IM,,"['Binding Sites', 'Cell Line', 'Gene Products, tax/genetics/*metabolism', 'HSP40 Heat-Shock Proteins', 'HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Heat-Shock Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Molecular Chaperones/genetics/metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', '*Zinc Fingers']",2001/11/24 10:00,2002/02/05 10:01,['2001/11/24 10:00'],"['2001/11/24 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/24 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Curr Biol. 2001 Nov 13;11(22):1771-5. doi: 10.1016/s0960-9822(01)00540-1.,,"['S0960-9822(01)00540-1 [pii]', '10.1016/s0960-9822(01)00540-1 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,
