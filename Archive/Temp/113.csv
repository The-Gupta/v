In addition, well conducted systematic reviews of the literature that have explored the effects of exercise before, during, or after anticancer therapy have consistently shown positive outcomes to patients treated for solid tumors. Consistent findings include an overall reduction in fatigue, depression, anxiety, and distress, paired with positive changes in fitness parameters such as aerobic capacity and overall muscle function (Speck et al. 2010; Jones et al. 2006; McNeely et al. 2006; Markes et al. 2006; Schmitz et al. 2005; Galvao and Newton 2005). However, a relative paucity of data exists in the area of exercise interventions for adult patients with hematological malignancies. This chapter reviews the current literature regarding the administration of exercise in adult patients diagnosed with hematological cancer. The few exercise intervention studies conducted in patients with hematological cancers suggest that it is feasible to administer exercise to most patients and that exercise should be considered as an intervention to alleviate treatment-related symptoms. Yet, efficacy along with the appropriate mode, intensity, and frequency of exercise training in different types of hematological cancers are yet to be established and require further research.","['Department of Exercise and Sport Science and Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, 25 C Fetzer Hall, Chapel Hill, North Carolina 27599-8700, USA. claudio@email.unc.edu']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Some preliminary indications of a protective role for physical activity for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, leukemia, multiple myeloma, and Hodgkin's lymphoma exist, but the level of epidemiologic evidence is still insufficient to make any definitive conclusions regarding the nature of these associations. Several plausible biologic mechanisms underlying the possible associations between physical activity and hematologic cancers have been proposed, including enhancement of immune function, reduction in obesity, improvement of antioxidant defense systems, impact on metabolic hormones, and anti-inflammatory effects. Future studies should improve the estimation of physical activity by using more reliable, valid, and comprehensive measurement tools, assessing all components of physical activity (type, intensity, and time period), and conducting intervention studies to evaluate the effect of physical activity on various biomarkers of cancer in order to provide further insight into plausible biologic mechanisms underlying the possible association between physical activity and hematologic cancers.","['Centre for Chronic Disease Prevention and Control, Public Health Agency of Canada, 785 Carling Avenue, Locator: 6807B, Ottawa, Ontario, K1A 0K9, Canada sai.yi.pan@phac-aspc.gc.ca']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Data on coffee and tea drinking during pregnancy from 337 case mothers and 697 control mothers were analyzed using unconditional multivariable logistic regression. A meta-analysis of our findings with those of previous studies was also conducted. RESULTS: There was little evidence of an overall association between maternal coffee consumption and risk of ALL: OR 0.89 (95% CI 0.61, 1.30), although there was some suggestion that higher levels of intake might increase the risk in children of non-smoking mothers: OR for 2+ cups/day = 1.44 (95% CI 0.85, 2.42); this was supported by our meta-analysis. Risk was also elevated among cases with chromosomal translocations. The overall OR for maternal tea consumption was 0.82 (95% CI 0.56, 1.18), although the OR for T-cell ALL was 0.21 (95% CI 0.08, 0.51). Among ALL cases with translocations, the ORs for tea consumption tended to be elevated: OR = 1.70 (95% CI 0.79-3.68) for 2+ cups/day. CONCLUSIONS: The observed increased risk associated with coffee and tea consumption may be confined to ALL with translocations. These associations should be explored further in large international consortia.","['Telethon Institute for Child Health Research, Centre for Child Health Research, The University of Western Australia, West Perth, Australia. lizm@ichr.uwa.edu.au']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several studies have shown that cases with TP53 mutations and TP53 mutations without del(17p13) may be adverse prognostic factors. We studied 173 well-characterized CLL patients by direct sequencing to detect TP53 mutations (exons 2-11). TP53 mutations were detected in 14.5% (25 of 173) of samples. Most patients with del(17p13) had TP53 mutations (72.2%). Mutations in the absence of del(17p13) were found in 8.3% in our cohort, which were higher than other countries. Compared with cases without TP53 alterations, TP53 mutations and deletions were both associated with advanced stages and unmutated immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable region status. Survival analysis showed that the occurrence of TP53 mutations and del(17p13) were associated with shorter overall survival (OS), treatment-free survival (TFS), and resistance to chemotherapy. TP53 mutations were the variables strongly associated with OS and TFS by multivariate Cox regression analysis. Moreover, we also found that cases with TP53 mutations in the absence of del(17p13) had a similar clinical and biological course and similar poor short OS as cases carrying del(17p13) in Chinese patients with CLL.","['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing, 210029, China.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On transvaginal ultrasonography, a vaginal tumor with an irregular wall was detected, and the internal echo showed a hypoechoic and echogenic pattern. Ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) suggested that the vaginal tumor was likely to be a hematoma or a hemorrhagic tumor arising from ITP. Incision and resection for a hematoma or a hemorrhagic tumor were carried out in response to genital bleeding, introital pain, and pathological diagnosis. Postoperative microscopic examination confirmed that the tumor was a vaginal NHL. The final diagnosis using the Ann Arbor staging system was high-stage (stage IV) NHL.

Epub 2010 Nov 28.,"The classical view of the molecular clock is based on interlocked transcriptional-translational feedback loops. Because a substantial fraction of the mammalian genome is expressed in a circadian manner, chromatin remodeling has been proposed to be crucial in clock function. Here we show that Lys4 (K4) trimethylation of histone H3 is rhythmic and follows the same profile as previously described H3 acetylation on circadian promoters. MLL1, a mammalian homolog of Drosophila trithorax, is an H3K4-specific methyltransferase implicated in transcriptional control. We demonstrate that MLL1 is essential for circadian transcription and cyclic H3K4 trimethylation. MLL1 is in a complex with CLOCK-BMAL1 and contributes to its rhythmic recruitment to circadian promoters and to H3 acetylation. Yet MLL1 fails to interact with CLOCKDelta19, providing an explanation for this mutation's dominant negative phenotype. Our results favor a scenario in which H3K4 trimethylation by MLL1 is required to establish a permissive chromatin state for circadian transcription.","['Unite 904 INSERM-Epigenetic Control and Neuronal Plasticity, Department of Pharmacology, School of Medicine, University of California, Irvine, Irvine, California, USA.']","['R01 GM081634/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 AG033888/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'R21-AG033888/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-GM081634/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",PMC6501791,['NIHMS887434'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the identity of the critical BH3-only proteins and the mechanism of their action following treatment by diverse apoptotic stimuli remain to be fully resolved. We therefore used RNAi to screen the entire Bcl-2 family for their involvement in three major apoptotic pathways in HeLa cells. We found that Bcl-xL and Mcl-1 are major inhibitors of apoptosis induced by TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and proteasome inhibition. Among the 10 BH3-only proteins, Bid and Noxa were found to be critically involved in TRAIL-induced apoptosis, in which Noxa participates by constitutively binding to Mcl-1. Bim and Noxa were found to be necessary for ER stress-induced apoptosis, in which Noxa assisted Bim function by sequestering Mcl-1 and binding to Bcl-xL. As a critical BH3-only protein, Noxa was strongly upregulated and became associated with both Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL during apoptosis induced by proteasome inhibition. In addition, we found that Noxa became 'Mcl-1 free' following treatment by ER stress and proteasome inhibition, but not after TRAIL treatment. These results defined the critical Bcl-2 network during apoptosis and suggested that Noxa participated in triggering mitochondrial dysfunction in multiple apoptotic pathways through distinct mechanisms.","['Eppley Institute for Research in Cancer and Allied Diseases, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE 68198, USA.']","['GM76237/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM076237-05/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM076237/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM076237-04S1/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'GM76237-04S1/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3074052,['NIHMS247020'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we analyzed the clinicopathologic and cytogenetic features of 30 cases of de novo acute myeloid leukemia with inv(3)/t(3;3). The median patient age was 53 years (range, 27-77 years). The platelet count was variable (range, 21-597 x 10(9)/l, median: 128 x 10(9)/l), and two (6.7%) patients presented with thrombocytosis (>450 x 10(9)/l). Morphologically, these neoplasms showed a spectrum of findings. Myelomonocytic differentiation was most common in 11 (37%) cases. Morphological evidence of dysplasia was observed in at least one lineage in 23 of 25 (92%) cases in which maturing elements could be assessed. In all, 5 (17%) patients had isolated inv(3) or t(3;3) and 25 (83%) patients had additional cytogenetic abnormalities, most often monosomy 7 (40%). Eleven (37%) patients had a complex karyotype (>/= 3 additional abnormalities). FLT3 gene mutation by internal tandem duplication was identified in 2 of 23 (9%) cases assessed. No clinical, pathological, or cytogenetic features independent of inv(3) or t(3;3) correlated with a worse outcome. However, patients treated with allogeneic stem cell transplantation (n=11) had a significantly better survival than did those treated with chemotherapy alone (n=17) (13.8 vs 8.0 months, P=0.041). We conclude that de novo acute myeloid leukemia associated with inv(3)/t(3;3) is an aggressive type of leukemia regardless of morphological or karyotypic findings, supporting the inclusion of this disease as a specific entity defined by inv(3)/t(3;3) in the WHO classification. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation seems to improve outcome in patients with this disease.","['Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Herein, the success stories of small molecule-targeted drugs, such as imatinib for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia and the tumor-specific antibody rituximab for the treatment of CD20-positive lymphoma, will be introduced. The introduction of imatinib and rituximab has changed the mortality rates associated with chronic myeloid leukemia and CD20-positive lymphoma, respectively. In particular, the therapeutic outcomes of imatinib treatment have been so good that clinical trials to assess the feasibility of treatment discontinuation after remission are ongoing. Methods for developing new anti-cancer agents have changed, and structure-based chemical compounds are now screened in silico. Second- and third-generation anti-cancer agents have already been successfully identified, and resistance mechanisms have been explained based on the interaction of these chemical structures with their target molecules. In the area of antibody development, the introduction of humanized antibody has been successful, and the use of antibody carriers has resulted in the development of potent second-line antibody drugs. The discovery of new target surface markers is also being reported, and trials for both chimeric and humanized antibodies against these molecules are ongoing. Through these efforts, disease mortality rates have begun to decline.

Epub 2010 Nov 26.,"PURPOSE: Increasing age has been an adverse risk factor in children with neuroblastoma (NB) since the 1970's, with a 12-month age-at-diagnosis cut-off for treatment stratification. Over the last 30 years, treatment intensity for children >12 months with advanced-stage disease has increased; to investigate if this strategy has improved outcome and/or reduced the prognostic influence of age, we analysed the International Neuroblastoma Risk Group (INRG) database. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data from 11,037 children with NB (1974-2002) from Australia, Europe, Japan, North America. Cox modelling of event-free survival (EFS) tested if the era and prognostic significance of age-of-diagnosis, adjusted for bone marrow (BM) metastases and MYCN status, effects on outcome had changed. RESULTS: Outcome improved over time: 3-year EFS 46% (1974-1989) and 71% (1997-2002). The risk for those >18 months against </=12 decreased: hazard ratio (HR); 4.61 and 3.94. For age 13-18 months, EFS increased from 42% to 77%. Outcome was worse if: >18 months (HR 4.47); BM metastases (HR 4.00); and MYCN amplified (HR 3.97). For 1997-2002, the EFS for >18 months with BM involvement and MYCN amplification was 18%, but 89% for 0-12 months with neither BM involvement nor MYCN amplification. CONCLUSIONS: There is clear evidence for improving outcomes for children with NB over calendar time. The adverse influence of increasing age-at-diagnosis has declined but it remains a powerful indicator of unfavourable prognosis. These results support the age-of-diagnosis cut-off of greater than 18 months as a risk criterion in the INRG classification system.","[""Children's Cancer and Leukaemia Group Data Centre, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK.""]","['U10 CA98413/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10-CA29139/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10-CA98413/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10-CA98543/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,['Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Here we identified T cell immunoglobulin mucin-3 (TIM-3) as a surface molecule expressed on LSCs in most types of AML except for acute promyelocytic leukemia, but not on normal hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). TIM-3(+) but not TIM-3(-) AML cells reconstituted human AML in immunodeficient mice, suggesting that the TIM-3(+) population contains most, if not all, of functional LSCs. We established an anti-human TIM-3 mouse IgG2a antibody having complement-dependent and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxic activities. This antibody did not harm reconstitution of normal human HSCs, but blocked engraftment of AML after xenotransplantation. Furthermore, when it is administered into mice grafted with human AML, this treatment dramatically diminished their leukemic burden and eliminated LSCs capable of reconstituting human AML in secondary recipients. These data suggest that TIM-3 is one of the promising targets to eradicate AML LSCs.","['Department of Medicine and Biosystemic Sciences, Kyushu University Graduate School of Medicine, Fukuoka, Japan.']",,,,,['Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

In the present study, we demonstrate that PG reduced cell viability in THP-1, Jurkat, and HL-60 leukemia cells and induced apoptosis in THP-1 cells. PG activated caspases 3, 8, and 9 and increased the levels of p53, Bax, Fas, and Fas ligand. PG activated mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), inhibited nuclear translocation of the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf-2) and induced intracellular glutathione (GSH) depletion. In addition, PG increased superoxide dismutase-1 expression and decreased intracellular levels of reactive oxygen species. Our data show for the first time that an early event of PG-induced apoptosis is MAPKs/Nrf-2-mediated GSH depletion and that PG induced apoptosis via multiple pathways in human leukemia.

The hazard ratio (HR) per 100 nanoGray/hour (nGy/h) was significantly increased for total malignancies and for several sites; however, contrary to expectations, an obvious and anticipated linear exposure-response relationship could not be identified. With the lowest exposure category (0-60 nGy/h) as reference, a statistically significantly increased HR for total malignancies was seen in all exposure categories, except in the highest category 96-366 nGy/h.

Immunohistochemical surrogates for the detection of genetic alterations involving the CCND1, PML, anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) and nucleophosmin (NPM1) genes are presented as examples for this approach. Because of their high specificity, rapidity, low costs and ease of performance, these assays have the potential for being extensively applied in developing countries. In some instances (e.g. detection of ALK protein) immunohistochemistry has fully replaced molecular studies for routine diagnosis in paraffin-embedded specimens.

Quantitative real-time and nested PCR guarantee highest sensitivities, but suitable markers for follow-up are available for approximately 60% of patients only: e.g. for those with reciprocal gene rearrangements or those with NPM1 mutations. On the other hand, for most AML patients, multiparameter flow cytometry (MFC) represents a good option for MRD monitoring. In virtually all AML patients, leukemia-associated immunophenotypes (LAIPs) are detectable with MFC. These can be targeted with high sensitivity ranging up to 10(-4) during the course of disease. Numerous studies demonstrated the prognostic power of the MRD levels determined by MFC at post-induction as well as post-consolidation time points in adults and children considered to be in hematologic remission of AML. The post-consolidation MRD status seems to have more prognostic power than post-induction levels. Thus, MFC can significantly contribute to risk assessment of patients with AML during and after treatment and allows clinicians to consider alternative strategies (e.g. allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation) earlier. Clinical studies need to focus on a standardization of these approaches to facilitate the translation of MFC-based MRD assessment into therapeutic decisions in patients with AML.","['MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Max-Lebsche-Platz 31, 81377 Munich, Germany. wolfgang.kern@mll-online.com']",,,,,['Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

MC heterogeneity is often organ-specific and is considered to be related to MC plasticity, disease-associated factors, and the maturation stage of the cells. The stem cell factor (SCF) receptor KIT (CD117) is expressed on all types of MC independent of maturation and activation-status. In systemic mastocytosis (SM), KIT is often expressed in MC in a mutated and constitutively activated form. In these patients, MC aberrantly display CD2 and CD25, diagnostic markers of neoplastic MC in all SM variants. In advanced SM, MC co-express substantial amounts of CD30, whereas CD2 expression on MC may be decreased compared to indolent SM. Other surface molecules, such as CD63 or CD203c, are overexpressed on neoplastic MC in SM, and are further upregulated upon cross-linking of the IgE receptor. Some of the cell surface antigens expressed on MC or their progenitors may serve as therapeutic targets in the future. These targets include CD25, CD30, CD33, CD44, and CD117/KIT. The current article provides an overview on cell surface antigens and target receptors expressed by MC in physiologic and reactive tissues, and in patients with SM, with special reference to phenotypic heterogeneity and clinical implications.","['Ludwig Boltzmann Cluster Oncology, Vienna, Austria. peter.valent@meduniwien.ac.at']",,,,,['Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Epub 2010 Oct 29.,"The basic hypothesis of surrogate marker profiles is that individual genetic lesions result in characteristic distortions of the cellular phenotype with some predictable consistency that can be exploited by sophisticated immunophenotyping. While cytogenetic and molecular aberrancies currently are accepted prognostic predictors in acute leukemias, single antigen expression and even antigenic profiles rarely impact on prognosis. However, increasingly, phenotypes are delineated which can serve as surrogates for underlying genetic aberrations of clinical importance. This development is of particular significance as antileukemic therapy becomes available that targets any component of the disturbed molecular pathways associated with these genetic lesions. This chapter will focus on established surrogate marker profiles, such as those for PML/RARalpha, AML1/ETO, FLT3-gene mutated acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), and BCR/ABL(POS) ALL. As the list of therapeutic targets grows, the role of surrogate antigen profiles will grow, as they can predict for the efficacy of targeted approaches in lieu of expensive, time-consuming and not always accessible genetic analyses.","['Montefiore Medical Center-North Division, Immunology Laboratory, Cancer Center, 600 East 233rd Street, Bronx, NY 10466, USA. epaietta@earthlink.net']",,,,,['Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Epub 2010 Oct 28.,"The generation of antisera directed against leukocyte differentiation antigens opened the possibility of studying minimal residual disease (MRD) in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). During the three decades that followed the pioneering studies in this field, great progress has been made in the development of a wide array of monoclonal antibodies and of flow cytometric techniques for rare event detection. This advance was accompanied by an increasingly greater understanding of the immunophenotypic features of leukemic and normal lymphoid cells, and of the antigenic differences that make MRD studies possible. In parallel, molecular methods for MRD detection were established. The systematic application of immunologic and molecular techniques to study MRD in clinical samples has demonstrated the clinical significance of MRD in patients, leading to the use of MRD to regulate treatment intensity in many contemporary protocols. In this article, we discuss methodologic issues related to the immunologic monitoring of MRD and the evidence supporting its clinical significance, and compare the advantages and limitations of this approach to those of molecular monitoring of MRD.","[""Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, 262 Danny Thomas Place, Memphis, TN 38105, USA.""]","['CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA060419/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA60419/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 CA060419/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA021765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA052259/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3006231,['NIHMS249344'],,['Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

We examined total cancer mortality as well as site-specific cancer mortality. We constructed a retrospective birth cohort by linking South Korean birth records to death records from 1995 to 2004. Parental socioeconomic position and birth characteristics were identified from the birth records. Parental education and occupation were examined as socioeconomic variables while sex, parental age, gestational age, birth weight, multiple birth, birth order, and the death of previous children were included as birth characteristics. Cancer deaths were identified from the death records. In total, 5711,337 births were analyzed, including 30,844,015 total person-years. The total number of deaths was 21,217, including 1102 children who died of cancer. Hazard ratios of cancer mortality according to parental socioeconomic position were calculated using a Cox proportional hazard analysis with adjustment for the birth characteristics. All socioeconomic measures except maternal occupation showed a significant inverse association with cancer mortality after adjusting for the birth characteristics. For paternal education, high school and middle school graduation or lower was associated with an increased hazard ratio of cancer mortality compared to university education or higher: 1.14 (1.00-1.29) and 1.29 (1.02-1.62), respectively. For maternal education, middle school graduation or lower was associated with a hazard ratio of 1.54 (1.21-1.95). For paternal occupation, manual work and economic inactivity were associated with increased hazard ratios as compared to non-manual work: 1.17 (1.02-1.34) and 1.34 (1.04-1.73), respectively. Inequalities were also found for leukemia and central nervous system tumors. The extent of the inequalities decreased after age 5, and only the 1-4-year-old group showed significant associations with parental socioeconomic position. We conclude that there is an inverse relationship between childhood cancer mortality and parental socioeconomic position in Korea.","['Department of Preventive Medicine, College of Medicine, Kangwon National University, Chunchon, Republic of Korea.']",,,,,['Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta) has recently been found to positively regulate the activity of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB). Here, we investigated the relationship between GSK-3beta inhibition and NF-kappaB in apoptosis of pediatric primary leukemia cells obtained from 39 newly diagnosed ALL children in China. METHODS: Bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMC) were isolated by density gradient centrifugation from the heparinized aspirates of children with ALL. We used immunofluorescence staining to detect nuclear GSK-3beta in these cells. After treatment with chemically distinct GSK-3beta inhibitors in vitro, NF-kappaB transcriptional activity was identified by means of western blotting and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). NF-kappaB-mediated apoptosis was detected by Annexin V-PE/7-AAD double-staining flow cytometry. The expression level of the survivin gene was detected by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RESULTS: GSK-3beta significantly accumulates in the nuclei of ALL cells than in the nuclei of control cells. Cell death induced by GSK-3beta inhibition in ALL cells was mediated by a downregulation of NF-kappaB p65 transcriptional activity. GSK-3beta inhibition significantly decreased the expression of the NF-kappaB target gene survivin. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that inhibition of GSK-3beta downregulates the NF-kappaB activation pathway, leading to suppression of the expression of an NF-kappaB-regulated gene and promotion of apoptosis in ALL cells in vitro. Furthermore, our findings suggest that GSK-3beta or NF-kappaB is a potential therapeutic target in the treatment of pediatric ALL.","[""Laboratory of Oncology, Affiliated Children's Hospital, Chongqing Medical University, No,136, Zhongshan 2nd Road, Yuzhong District, Chongqing 86 400014, China.""]",,PMC3002327,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The tests were carried out against leukemia (CCRF-CEM), colon (HT-29), lung (HTB-54), and breast (MCF-7) cancer cells. In order to assess the selectivity of the compounds under investigation the assays were also carried out on two non-tumoral lines - one mammary (184B5) and one bronchial epithelium (BEAS-2B) cell line. Assay-based antiproliferative activity studies revealed that seven derivatives (2a, 2c, 2e, 2f, 2g, 3a, and 3b) exhibited good activity against MCF-7 cells: for instance, 2c and 2f inhibited cell growth with nanomolar GI(5)(0) values. Compound 2f had a better antitumoral profile than vinorelbine and paclitaxel, two drugs that are used as first-line treatments in advanced, recurrent, and/or metastatic cancer. In the other cell lines the compounds showed moderate activity or were inactive - with the exception of 2a, which was also found to have antiproliferative activity. Modulation of the cell cycle and apoptotic effects of active compounds were further evaluated in MCF-7 cells. Of these, 6-bromo[1,2,5]selenadiazolo[3,4-b]pyridine (2a) was the most active, with an apoptogenic effect 3.9 times higher than that of camptothecin, which was used as a positive control. Compound 2a also provoked cell cycle arrest with a significant decrease in the G(0)/G(1) phase cell population and an increase in S and G(2)/M cells, thus suggesting mitotic arrest prior to metaphase.","['Departamento de Quimica Organica y Farmaceutica, University of Navarra, Pamplona, Spain.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As many promising targeted therapies affect kinase activity of specific enzymes involved in cancer transformation, H1 phosphorylation can serve as potential pharmacodynamic marker for drug activity within the cell. In this study we utilized a phosphoproteomic workflow to characterize histone H1 phosphorylation changes associated with two targeted therapies in the Kasumi-1 acute myeloid leukemia cell line. The phosphoproteomic workflow was first validated with standard casein phosphoproteins and then applied to the direct analysis of histone H1 from Kasumi-1 nuclear lysates. Ten H1 phosphorylation sites were identified on the H1 variants, H1.2, H1.3, H1.4, H1.5 and H1.x. LC MS profiling of intact H1s demonstrated global dephosphorylation of H1.5 associated with therapy by the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, flavopiridol and the Heat Shock Protein 90 inhibitor, 17-(Allylamino)-17-demethoxygeldanamycin. In contrast, independent treatments with a nucleotide analog, proteosome inhibitor and histone deacetylase inhibitor did not exhibit decreased H1.5 phosphorylation. The data presented herein demonstrate that potential of histones to assess the cellular response of reagents that have direct and indirect effects on kinase activity that alters histone phosphorylation. As such, this approach may be a highly informative marker for response to targeted therapies influencing histone phosphorylation.","['Department of Chemistry, The Ohio State University, Columbus OH, USA.']","['S10 RR023647/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'S10 RR023647-01/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'R56 CA107106/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'RR023647/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'CA101956/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA101956/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA107106-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA107106/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA107106/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3021470,['NIHMS262344'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A gene expression microarray analysis was performed, as well as gene expression and enzyme activity measurements of key enzymes in the activation of AraG. Cytotoxicity of AraG and cross-resistance to other compounds were evaluated using a standard cytotoxicity assay. RESULTS: Gene expression microarray analysis revealed that fetal hemoglobin genes and the multidrug resistance ABCB1 gene, encoding the drug efflux pump P-gp, were the most highly upregulated genes in the resistant cells, while genes traditionally associated with nucleoside analog resistance were not. Fetal hemoglobin and ABCB1 induction can be due to global DNA hypomethylation. This phenomenon was studied using AraG during a period of 4 weeks in MOLT-4 cells and the lung adenocarcinoma cell line A549, leading to up-regulation of hemoglobin gamma and ABCB1 as well as DNA hypomethylation. Inhibiting P-gp in the AraG-resistant MOLT-4 cells led to decreased proliferation, reduced hemoglobin expression, and highly induced ABCB1 expression. CONCLUSIONS: We show that AraG can cause hypomethylation of DNA and induce the expression of the fetal hemoglobin gamma gene and the ABCB1 gene. We speculate that the induction of ABCB1/P-gp may occur in order to help with excretion of hemoglobin degradation products that would otherwise be toxic to the cells, and we present data supporting our theory that P-gp may be linked to the induction of hemoglobin.","['Department of Medicine and Health, Linkoping University, Linkoping, Sweden. anna.fyrberg@liu.se']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we identified a heterozygous frameshift mutation (I373fsX91) in the carboxy-terminus of the TIS11D gene in leukemic cells from a patient with acute myeloid leukemia. Moreover, biallelic inactivation of the TIS11D gene resulting from a hemizygous frameshift mutation (G107fsX80) was identified in the Burkitt's lymphoma cell line DG75. In HeLa cells, overexpression of wild-type TIS11D protein (TIS11D(WT)) induced growth inhibition and an S phase checkpoint response, while the mutant protein (TIS11D(I373fsX91)) showed a diminished effect. Interestingly, this response was accompanied by p21 downregulation, which is frequently seen in the cellular response to ultraviolet irradiation.

However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying this therapy, and molecular markers useful to monitor the disease and the effect of the treatment are needed. Phosphoinositide-phospholipase C (PI-PLC) beta1 is involved in both genetic and epigenetic mechanisms of MDS progression to acute myeloid leukemia. Indeed, AZA as a single agent was able to induce PI-PLCbeta1 expression, therefore providing a promising new tool in the evaluation of response to demethylating therapies. In this study, we assessed the efficacy of the combination of AZA and VPA on inducing PI-PLCbeta1 expression in high-risk MDS patients. Furthermore, we observed an increase in Cyclin D3 expression, a downstream target of PI-PLCbeta1 signaling, therefore suggesting a potential combined activity of AZA and VPA in high-risk MDS in activating PI-PLCbeta1 signaling, thus affecting cell proliferation and differentiation. Taken together, our findings might open up new lines of investigations aiming at evaluating the role of the activation of PI-PLCbeta1 signaling in the epigenetic therapy, which may also lead to the identification of innovative targets for the epigenetic therapy of high-risk MDS.","['Department of Human Anatomical Sciences, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Resulting hybrid protein was shown to have a role in pre-leukemia establishment. To address its role for leukemic cell survival, we applied RNA interference to silence TEL/AML1 in leukemic cells. We designed and tested 11 different oligonucleotides targeting the TEL/AML1 fusion site. Using most efficient siRNAs, we achieved an average of 74-86% TEL/AML1 protein knockdown in REH and UOC-B6 leukemic cells, respectively. TEL/AML1 silencing neither decreased cell viability, nor induced apoptosis. On the contrary, it resulted in the modest but significant increase in the S phase fraction and in higher proliferation rate. Opposite effects on cell cycle distribution and proliferation were induced by AML1 silencing, thus, supporting our hypothesis that TEL/AML1 may block AML1-mediated promotion of G1/S progression through the cell cycle. In line with the lack of major effect on phenotype, we found no significant changes in clonogenic potential and global gene expression pattern upon TEL/AML1 depletion. Our data suggest that though TEL/AML1 is important for the (pre)leukemic clone development, it may be dispensable for leukemic cell survival and would not be a suitable target for gene-specific therapy.","['CLIP, Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, 2nd Faculty of Medicine, Charles University Prague and University Hospital Motol, Prague, Czech Republic. marketa.zaliova@lfmotol.cuni.cz']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2010 Nov 25.,"BACKGROUND: The prognostic value of cytogenetic findings in chronic myelomonocytic leukemia is unclear. Our purpose was to evaluate the independent prognostic impact of cytogenetic abnormalities in a large series of patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia included in the database of the Spanish Registry of Myelodysplastic Syndromes. DESIGN AND METHODS: We studied 414 patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia according to WHO criteria and with a successful conventional cytogenetic analysis at diagnosis. Different patient and disease characteristics were examined by univariate and multivariate methods to establish their relationship with overall survival and evolution to acute myeloid leukemia. RESULTS: Patients with abnormal karyotype (110 patients, 27%) had poorer overall survival (P=0.001) and higher risk of acute myeloid leukemia evolution (P=0.010). Based on outcome analysis, three cytogenetic risk categories were identified: low risk (normal karyotype or loss of Y chromosome as a single anomaly), high risk (presence of trisomy 8 or abnormalities of chromosome 7, or complex karyotype), and intermediate risk (all other abnormalities). Overall survival at five years for patients in the low, intermediate, and high risk cytogenetic categories was 35%, 26%, and 4%, respectively (P<0.001). Multivariate analysis confirmed that this new CMML-specific cytogenetic risk stratification was an independent prognostic variable for overall survival (P=0.001). Additionally, patients belonging to the high-risk cytogenetic category also had a higher risk of acute myeloid leukemia evolution on univariate (P=0.001) but not multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Cytogenetic findings have a strong prognostic impact in patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia.","['Hospital Universitario La Fe, Avenida Campanar, 21. 46009 Valencia, Spain.']",,PMC3046268,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2010 Nov 25.,"BACKGROUND: Challenge of MHC-mismatched murine bone marrow chimeras with recipient-type lymphocytes (recipient lymphocyte infusion) produces antileukemic responses in association with rejection of donor chimerism. In contrast, MHC-matched chimeras resist eradication of donor chimerism by recipient lymphocyte infusion. Here, we investigated lymphohematopoietic host-versus-graft reactivity and antileukemic responses in the MHC-matched setting, which is reminiscent of the majority of clinical transplants. DESIGN AND METHODS: We challenged C3H-->AKR radiation chimeras with AKR-type splenocytes (i.e. recipient lymphocyte infusion) and BW5147.3 leukemia cells. We studied the kinetics of chimerism using flowcytometry and the mechanisms involved in antileukemic effects using in vivo antibody-mediated depletion of CD8(+) T and NK cells, and intracellular cytokine staining. RESULTS: Whereas control chimeras showed progressive evolution towards high-level donor T-cell chimerism, recipient lymphocyte infusion chimeras showed a limited reduction of donor chimerism with delayed onset and long-term preservation of lower-level mixed chimerism. Recipient lymphocyte infusion chimeras nevertheless showed a significant survival benefit after leukemia challenge. In vivo antibody-mediated depletion experiments showed that both CD8(+) T cells and NK cells contribute to the antileukemic effect. Consistent with a role for NK cells, the proportion of IFN-gamma producing NK cells in recipient lymphocyte infusion chimeras was significantly higher than in control chimeras. CONCLUSIONS: In the MHC-matched setting, recipient lymphocyte infusion elicits lymphohematopoietic host-versus-graft reactivity that is limited but sufficient to provide an antileukemic effect, and this is dependent on CD8(+) T cells and NK cells. The data indicate that NK cells are activated as a bystander phenomenon during lymphohematopoietic T-cell alloreactivity and thus support a novel type of NK involvement in anti-tumor responses after post-transplant adoptive cell therapy.","['Laboratory of Experimental Transplantation, University of Leuven, Belgium.']",,PMC3046274,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2010 Nov 24.,"BACKGROUND: Tumour necrosis factor (TNF) is central to the pathophysiological process of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), whether as soluble cytokine or membrane-expressed pro-TNF (mTNF). OBJECTIVES: To determine whether neutrophils, which can express TNF, are activated in the blood of patients with RA compared with healthy controls. To investigate, by focusing on mTNF expression, if the functions of RA neutrophils change in response to therapeutic TNF inhibition. METHODS: TNF was measured by flow cytometry and qPCR in neutrophils from 20 patients with RA before and after the start of TNF inhibitor therapy. Apoptosis was measured by morphology, and western blotting of pro- and antiapoptotic proteins in cell lysates. Nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation was determined by western blotting of phosphorylated NF-kappaB (p65). RESULTS: Before treatment RA neutrophils exhibited increased TNF mRNA expression, elevated mTNF levels and NF-kappaB activity compared with controls. They also underwent delayed apoptosis as shown by altered expression of anti- and proapoptotic proteins, such as Mcl-1 and caspases. Neutrophil TNF expression returned to baseline levels during successful treatment with anti-TNF biological agents, and there was a close correlation between clinical disease improvement and changes in neutrophil function. CONCLUSIONS: Neutrophils express elevated levels of TNF in RA and the transcription factor, NF-kappaB, a target of TNF, is activated. This mechanism could lead to a self-sustained inflammatory process. These data point to an important role of neutrophils in the abnormal TNF signalling pathways activated in RA and provide new evidence that neutrophils actively contribute to altered cytokine signalling in inflammatory diseases.","['Biosciences Building,Crown Street,University of Liverpool,Liverpool L69 7ZB, UK.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Dasatinib and nilotinib, two newer drugs with higher potency than imatinib against BCR-ABL and activity against most imatinib-resistant BCR-ABL mutations, have each shown superior efficacy compared with imatinib for first-line treatment of chronic-phase CML in randomized phase 3 trials.

Compared with imatinib, dasatinib is associated with higher rates of pleural effusion and thrombocytopenia, but lower rates of edema, gastrointestinal AEs, musculoskeletal AEs, and rash. Nilotinib is associated with higher rates of dermatologic toxicity, headache, and biochemical abnormalities associated with hepatic and pancreatic toxicity compared with imatinib, but lower rates of edema, gastrointestinal AEs, muscle spasm, and neutropenia. Several studies have shown that poor adherence to imatinib detrimentally affects responses and should be considered in patients with a suboptimal response. The different dosing requirements of dasatinib (once daily with or without food) and nilotinib (twice daily with fasting) may be an additional factor in selecting frontline agents.

Eighteen patients (mean age, 6.9 yr; 11 ALL and seven AML) underwent high-dose cyclophosphamide treatment and total body irradiation as preparative conditioning for HSCT. QTD, QTcD, echocardiographic functional parameters, and cumulative anthracycline dose were evaluated. We compared these values between patients with and without cardiac complications. Among 18 patients, seven patients experienced cardiac complications (heart failure in four, arrhythmia in three). There were significant differences in QTD (43.7 ms in patients with cardiac complications vs. 30.2 ms in patients without the complications, p = 0.019) and QTcD (55.3 vs. 36.9 ms, p = 0.003) between the two groups. On the other hand, the cumulative dose of anthracycline and echocardiographic parameters were not significantly different between the two groups. Increases in QTD and QTcD during the pretreatment period may be risk factors for the development of cardiac complications during and after conditioning for pediatric HSCT.","['Department of Pediatrics, Shinshu University School of Medicine, Matsumoto Department of Pediatrics, Nagano National Hospital, Ueda, Japan. nmotoki@shinshu-u.ac.jp']",,,,,['(c) 2010 John Wiley & Sons A/S.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In a retrospective study, we compared allogeneic PBSCT (n = 30) with BMT (n = 110) in children with acute leukemia between January 2001 and September 2006. PROCEDURE: Median age for PBSCT was 9 years versus 8 years for BMT. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the demographic and medical variables. The unadjusted probabilities of disease-free survival were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The association of graft-source and time to each of the study endpoints was estimated by Cox's regression model and the occurrence of graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) was included as a time-dependent covariate. RESULTS: Time to neutrophil engraftment and platelet independence was faster after PBSCT than BMT (neutrophils 15.0 days vs. 17.0 days, P < 0.001; platelets, 21.0 days vs. 27.0 days, P = 0.034). The cumulative incidence of grades II-IV acute GvHD at 100 days was 10.4% (SE 5.6%) after PBSCT and 15.1% (SE 3.5%) after BMT (P = NS). The cumulative incidence of chronic GvHD was 13.8% (SE 6.3%) after PBSCT and 11.3% (SE 3.1%) after BMT (P = NS). One-year disease-free survival was 37.9% (SE 9.0%) for PBSCT recipients versus 65.1% (SE 4.6%) after BMT (P = 0.005) but this difference was not sustained in multivariate analysis. Thus, only disease risk and pre-transplant CMV seropositivity were significant predictors of disease-free survival. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that PBSCT for children produces faster engraftment without increased risk of acute or chronic GvHD.","['Center for Cell and Gene Therapy, Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas 77030, USA. yufengl@bcm.edu']",['P30 CA 125123/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: Twenty-one children with histologically proven LCH were identified. Of these, the case histories of 16 children who had been treated with pamidronate (PAM) for disease reactivation were analyzed in detail. The median post-PAM therapy follow-up period was 2.8 years (range: 0.9-9.3 years). The median age at commencement of PAM therapy was 9.4 years (range: 2.3-15.0 years). All children had one or more bone lesions but none had risk organ (RO) involvement. In the majority of the children, six courses of PAM were administered at a dose of 1.0 mg/kg/course at 4-week intervals. In 12 of the 16 children, all active lesions including lesions of the skin (n = 3) and soft tissues (n = 3) resolved. Of these children, eight children had no active disease for a median of 3.3 years post-PAM therapy (range: 1.8-9.3 years). Progression-free survival (PFS) was 56.3 +/- 12.4% at 3 years.

PROCEDURE: Data were examined from 16 PBCRs in Brazilian cities located in five geographical regions during the period from 1997 to 2004. Incidence rates were analyzed according to gender, age, and type of leukemia. The Wilcoxon test was performed to evaluate for gender-age based difference between by leukemia type. RESULTS: The median age-adjusted incidence rate (AAIR) of leukemia in children aged 0-14 years old was 53.3 per million. A different AAIR was found regarding ALL and myeloproliferative disorders (MPD) that ranged from 24.8 to 76.84 per 1,000,000 children. Manaus, although located in a poor area of Brazil, exhibited the highest AAIR (56.6 per million) of ALL. Goiania had the highest AAIR (24.5 per million) of MPD.

CONCLUSIONS: This population-based study of childhood leukemia demonstrates that substantial regional differences exist regarding the incidence of acute leukemia in Brazil, which warrants further ecological study.","['Coordenacao de Prevencao e Vigilancia, Instituto Nacional do Cancer, Rua dos Invalidos, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Genotypes 2 and 3 may cause diagnostic difficulties and their epidemiology is not well understood. In the present study the prevalence of B19V genotypes in patients with symptomatic infection in Poland was evaluated and the course of infection in patients infected with non-genotype 1 strains is described. Real-time PCR, able to detect all three genotypes of B19V was used to screen patient plasma samples. Sixty-nine, mainly acute-phase B19V DNA positive cases were identified in patients from hematological and obstetric/gynecological wards between 2004 and 2008. Thirty patients were studied in greater detail and genotyping was performed by analysis of the NS1/VP1u region. The majority of samples were genotype 1. However two (6.6%) strains were identified as genotype 2, associated with high viremia and identified in a kidney transplant recipient with anemia and a leukemia patient, following chemotherapy, with pancytopenia. A change of immunosuppression treatment in the former and treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin in latter, resulted in normalization of clinical parameters, and whilst viral loads fell, B19V DNA was still detectable. The kidney transplant recipient subsequently became pregnant with no clinical complications, although persistently infected with B19V genotype 2. This is the first description of symptomatic cases of genotype 2 B19V infection in Eastern Europe suggesting that acute infection, particularly among immunocompromised patients with these virus strains may be more prevalent than thought.","['Department of Immunohaematology, Institute of Haematology and Transfusion Medicine, Warsaw, Poland. pgrabarczyk@ihit.waw.pl']",,,,,"['(c) 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']","['GENBANK/FN827057', 'GENBANK/FN827058', 'GENBANK/FN827059', 'GENBANK/FN827060', 'GENBANK/FN827061', 'GENBANK/FN827062', 'GENBANK/FN827063', 'GENBANK/FN827064', 'GENBANK/FN827065', 'GENBANK/FN827066', 'GENBANK/FN827067', 'GENBANK/FN827068', 'GENBANK/FN827069', 'GENBANK/FN827070', 'GENBANK/FN827071', 'GENBANK/FN827072', 'GENBANK/FN827073', 'GENBANK/FN827074', 'GENBANK/FN827075', 'GENBANK/FN827076', 'GENBANK/FN827077', 'GENBANK/FN827078', 'GENBANK/FN827079', 'GENBANK/FN827080', 'GENBANK/FN827081', 'GENBANK/FN827082', 'GENBANK/FN827083', 'GENBANK/FN827084', 'GENBANK/FN827085', 'GENBANK/FN827086']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In various leukemias, only small subpopulations of cells can transfer disease upon transplantation into immunocompromised NOD/SCID mice, and markers that distinguish the leukemogenic cancer cells from the bulk populations of non-leukemogenic cells have been identified. However, the phenotype of LICs is heterogeneous: it is variable for the different types of acute myeloid leukemias; cells with different membrane phenotype can act as LICs in each B-acute lymphoid leukemia; LICs change during the evolution of chronic myeloid leukemia from the chronic to the acute phase. There is a general consensus that the identification and characterization of leukemic stem cells might lead to the identification of new therapeutic targets and, through this way, to more effective treatments by focusing therapy on the most malignant cells.","['Department of Hematology, Oncology and Molecular Medicine, Istituto Supeirore di Sanita, Viale Regina Elena 299, Rome, Italy. ugo.testa@iss.it']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Treatment results are unfavorable. High-dose chemotherapy and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) may improve patient outcome. For autologous HSCT, a critical review of the literature shows that most patients with nasal NK cell lymphoma in complete remission (CR) appear to do well without HSCT. However, patients with refractory diseases and untreated relapses have poor outcome with HSCT. Therefore, identification of patients with nasal NK cell lymphoma in CR who are at high risk of relapse may be necessary before autologous HSCT can be recommended. Patients with disseminated nasal NK cell lymphoma, non-nasal NK cell lymphoma and NK cell leukemia have poor outcome with autologous HSCT. Allogeneic HSCT may be beneficial to these patients. Most of the reported cases have been performed from HLA-identical sibling donors, and data on alternative HSC sources including matched unrelated donors and umbilical cord blood are very limited. Continuous efforts should be devoted to risk stratification for identifying high-risk individuals for HSCT, and defining the optimal conditioning regimen for NK cell lymphomas.","['Department of Medicine, Professorial Block, Queen Mary Hospital, University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam Road, Pokfulam, Hong Kong. ylkwong@hkucc.hku.hk']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we present a new nanoparticle system that capitalizes on a targeting pretreatment strategy, where a circulating fusion protein (FP) selectively prelabels the targeted cellular epitope, and a biotinylated iron oxide nanoparticle serves as a secondary label that binds to the FP on the target cell. This approach enables a single nanoparticle formulation to be used with any one of existing fusion proteins to bind a variety of target cells. We demonstrated this approach with two fusion proteins against two model cancer cell lines: lymphoma (Ramos) and leukemia (Jurkat), which showed 72.2% and 91.1% positive labeling, respectively. Notably, TEM analysis showed that a large nanoparticle population was endocytosed via attachment to the non-internalizing CD20 epitope.","['Department of Materials Science and Engineering, University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98195, USA.']","['R01 CA119408-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32CA138312/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA076287-12/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 EB006043-04/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA076287/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA138312-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01EB006043/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA134213/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA138312/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 EB006043/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA119408/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA134213-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA134213/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32GM065098/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 EB006043-03S1/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA076287/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA119408/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM065098/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3134371,['NIHMS302517'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Markov decision model compared 2 strategies: allo-HCT or chemotherapy in CR1. Patients who had intermediate- or unfavorable-risk AML had a longer life expectancy when they received allo-HCT in CR1 than patients treated with chemotherapy alone. Likewise, patients who had a suitable related donor who received allo-HCT in CR1 had a longer life expectancy. The life expectancy was shortened to a greater degree by adjustment for QOL in the allo-HCT group. Nevertheless, QOL-adjusted life expectancies in most of the subgroups remained longer in the allo-HCT group than in the chemotherapy group.

We have previously reported that the therapeutic antileukemic protein macromolecule Escherichia coli L-asparaginase is degraded by leukemic lysosomal cysteine proteases. In the present study, we successfully engineered L-asparaginase to resist proteolytic cleavage and at the same time improve activity. We employed a novel combination of mutant sampling using a genetic algorithm in tandem with flexibility studies using molecular dynamics to investigate the impact of lid-loop and mutations on drug activity. Applying these methods, we successfully predicted the more active L-asparaginase mutants N24T and N24A. For the latter, a unique hydrogen bond network contributes to higher activity. Furthermore, interface mutations controlling secondary glutaminase activity demonstrated the importance of this enzymatic activity for drug cytotoxicity. All selected mutants were expressed, purified, and tested for activity and for their ability to form the active tetrameric form. By introducing the N24A and N24A R195S mutations to the drug L-asparaginase, we are a step closer to individualized drug design.","[""Biomolecular Modelling Laboratory, Cancer Research UK London Research Institute, Lincoln's Inn Fields Laboratories, London, UK.""]",['14840/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The primary objective was to demonstrate that autografting improves the 5-year event-free survival (EFS) from 30% to 50%. There were 223 enrolled patients, 72% men and 28% women, 83% after first and 17% after second-line treatment. Binet stages were progressive A 13%, B 67%, C 20%; at randomization, 59% were in complete remission, and 41% in less than complete remission. Patients were randomized between autografting (n = 112) and observation (n = 111). Median EFS was 24.4 months (range, 16.7-32 months) in the observation group and 51.2 months (39.8-62.5 months) in the autografting group; the 5-year EFS was 24% and 42%, respectively (P < .001). Accordingly, the 5-year relapse incidence was 76% versus 54% (P < .001). Median time to relapse requiring therapy or death was 40 months (25-56 months) in the observation arm and 65 months (59-71 months) after autografting (P = .002). Cox modeling confirmed that autografting significantly improved EFS (hazard ratio 0.44, 95% confidence interval 0.30-0.65; P < .001). At 5 years, the probability of OS was 85.5% and 84.3% for autografting and observation, respectively (P = .77). In chronic lymphocytic leukemia, consolidating autografting reduces the risk of progression by more than 50% but has no effect on overall survival.","[""Hematology, Edouard Herriot Hospital, 5 Place d'Arsonval, Lyon Cedex 0369437, France. mauricette.michallet@chu-lyon.fr""]","['G0001160/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'MC_U137686856/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom']",,,,,,,,['EBMT Chronic Leukemia Working Party'],"['Divine A', 'de la Rue J', 'Westermann A', 'Van Biezen A', 'Cerna K', 'Lepretre S', 'Davies J', 'Pabst T', 'Maloisel F', 'Van Den Neste E', 'Brice P', 'Eghbali H', 'Tournilhac O', 'Cazin B', 'Berrebi A', 'Berthon C', 'Dumont J', 'Gobeler M', 'Glass B', 'Balleisen L', 'Patil K', 'Parker A', 'Morgan G', 'Bouabdallah K', 'Drake M', 'Johansson J', 'Wulf G', 'Blanc M', 'Orchard K', 'Metzner B', 'Wright J', 'Gonzalez H', 'Gaska T', 'Buzyn A', 'Rio B', 'Roth A', 'Dreyfus F', 'Bentz M', 'Wernli M', 'Culligan D', 'Messner B', 'Summerfield G', 'Pettitt A', 'Sirvent A', 'Glainer S', 'Marcus R', 'Blesing N', 'De Revel T', 'Sundstrom G', 'Gilleece M', 'Devereux S', 'Agrawal S', 'Kranzhofer N', 'Marrolleau J', 'Kelsey P', 'Al-Ismail S', 'Stable P', 'Stewart R', 'Hillman P', 'Stewart R', 'Liu Yin J', 'Pocock C', 'Ropner X', 'Lush R', 'Newton L', 'Bouheddou N', 'Echard M', 'Allard C', 'Cymbalista F', 'Albin N', 'Fenaux P', 'Peter N']","['Divine, A', 'de la Rue, J', 'Westermann, A', 'Van Biezen, A', 'Cerna, K', 'Lepretre, S', 'Davies, J', 'Pabst, T', 'Maloisel, F', 'Van Den Neste, E', 'Brice, P', 'Eghbali, H', 'Tournilhac, O', 'Cazin, B', 'Berrebi, A', 'Berthon, C', 'Dumont, J', 'Gobeler, M', 'Glass, B', 'Balleisen, L', 'Patil, K', 'Parker, A', 'Morgan, G', 'Bouabdallah, K', 'Drake, M', 'Johansson, J', 'Wulf, G', 'Blanc, M', 'Orchard, K', 'Metzner, B', 'Wright, J', 'Gonzalez, H', 'Gaska, T', 'Buzyn, A', 'Rio, B', 'Roth, A', 'Dreyfus, F', 'Bentz, M', 'Wernli, M', 'Culligan, D', 'Messner, B', 'Summerfield, G', 'Pettitt, A', 'Sirvent, A', 'Glainer, S', 'Marcus, R', 'Blesing, N', 'De Revel, T', 'Sundstrom, G', 'Gilleece, M', 'Devereux, S', 'Agrawal, S', 'Kranzhofer, N', 'Marrolleau, J', 'Kelsey, P', 'Al-Ismail, S', 'Stable, P', 'Stewart, R', 'Hillman, P', 'Stewart, R', 'Liu Yin, J', 'Pocock, C', 'Ropner, X', 'Lush, R', 'Newton, L', 'Bouheddou, N', 'Echard, M', 'Allard, C', 'Cymbalista, F', 'Albin, N', 'Fenaux, P', 'Peter, N']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among 865 BCP-ALL children treated on MRC ALL97, 52 (6%) had CRLF2-d, but it was more prevalent among Down syndrome patients (54%). P2RY8-CRLF2 (n = 43) was more frequent than IGH@-CRLF2 (n = 9). CRLF2-d was not associated with age, sex, or white cell count, but IGH@-CRLF2 patients were older than P2RY8-CRLF2 patients (median 8 vs 4 years, P = .0017). Patients with CRLF2-d were more likely to present with enlarged livers and spleens (38% vs 18%, P < .001). CRLF2-d was not seen in conjunction with established chromosomal translocations but 6 (12%) cases had high hyperdiploidy, and 5 (10%) had iAMP21. Univariate analysis suggested that CRLF2-d was associated with an inferior outcome: (event-free survival [EFS] hazard ratio 2.27 [95% confidence interval 1.48-3.47], P < .001; OS 3.69 [2.34-5.84], P < .001).

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The induction of cytotoxicity was evaluated in both primary B-CLL cell samples (n = 20) and in p53(wild-type) (EHEB, JVM-2) and p53(deleted/mutated) (MEC-2, BJAB) B leukemic cell lines. The role of Akt in modulating leukemic cell survival/apoptosis in response to Dasatinib or Dasatinib + Nutlin-3 was documented by functional experiments carried out using specific pharmacological inhibitors and by overexpression of membrane-targeted constitutively active form of Akt. RESULTS: The combination of Dasatinib + Nutlin-3 exhibited a synergistic cytotoxicity in the majority (19 out of 20) of B-CLL samples, including patients carrying 17p- (n = 4), and in both p53(wild-type) and p53(deleted/mutated) B leukemic cell lines. At the molecular level, Dasatinib significantly counteracted the Nutlin-3-mediated induction of the p53 transcriptional targets MDM2 and p21 observed in p53(wild-type) leukemic cells. Conversely, Nutlin-3 did not interfere with the ability of Dasatinib to decrease the phosphorylation levels of ERK1/2, p38/MAPK, and Akt in both p53(wild-type) and p53(deleted/mutated) B leukemic cell lines. A critical role of Akt downregulation in mediating the antileukemic activity of Dasatinib and Dasatinib + Nutlin-3 was demonstrated in experiments carried out by specifically modulating the Akt pathway. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that Dasatinib + Nutlin-3 might represent an innovative therapeutic combination for both p53(wild-type) and p53(deleted/mutated) B-CLL.","['Institute for Maternal and Child Health, IRCCS Burlo Garofolo, Trieste, Italy.']",,,,,['(c)2010 AACR.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2010 Nov 24.,"Gene expression within the context of eukaryotic chromatin is regulated by enzymes that catalyze histone lysine methylation. Histone lysine methyltransferases that have been identified to date possess the evolutionarily conserved SET or Dot1-like domains. We previously reported the identification of a new multi-subunit histone H3 lysine 4 methyltransferase lacking homology to the SET or Dot1 family of histone lysine methyltransferases. This enzymatic activity requires a complex that includes WRAD (WDR5, RbBP5, Ash2L, and DPY-30), a complex that is part of the MLL1 (mixed lineage leukemia protein-1) core complex but that also exists independently of MLL1 in the cell. Here, we report that the minimal complex required for WRAD enzymatic activity includes WDR5, RbBP5, and Ash2L and that DPY-30, although not required for enzymatic activity, increases the histone substrate specificity of the WRAD complex. We also show that WRAD requires zinc for catalytic activity, displays Michaelis-Menten kinetics, and is inhibited by S-adenosyl-homocysteine. In addition, we demonstrate that WRAD preferentially methylates lysine 4 of histone H3 within the context of the H3/H4 tetramer but does not methylate nucleosomal histone H3 on its own. In contrast, we find that MLL1 and WRAD are required for nucleosomal histone H3 methylation, and we provide evidence suggesting that each plays distinct structural and catalytic roles in the recognition and methylation of a nucleosome substrate. Our results indicate that WRAD is a new H3K4 methyltransferase with functions that include regulating the substrate and product specificities of the MLL1 core complex.","['Department of Biology, Syracuse University, Syracuse, New York 13244, USA.']","['R01 CA140522/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA140522/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3030342,,,,,,,,,,['J Biol Chem. 2011 May 20;286(20):18344'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This plant is rich in flavonoids, which are polyphenolic compounds widespread in plants, and that have diverse physiological effects. In a sub-acute toxicity assay it was found that an ethanolic extract of Cashew leaves elicited lymphopenia in rats. The extract was also found to be cytotoxic and to induce apoptosis in Jurkat (acute lymphoblastic leukemia) cells. The crude ethanolic extract was fractionated and resolved by HPLC. One of the four fractions obtained led to the isolation of the biflavonoid agasthisflavone. [(3)H]-thymidine incorporation assays and flow cytometry analysis showed that the isolated compound displayed a high anti-proliferative effect in Jurkat cells with an IC(50) of 2.4 mug/ml (4.45 muM). The effect of agathisflavone on the acute promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL60, Burkitt lymphoma Raji cells and Hep-2 laryngeal carcinoma cells was also tested. The two latter ones were only mildly affected by agathisflavone.

CCAAT/enhancer binding protein zeta (C/EBPzeta), a candidate TSG, has been found to be involved in cancers including AML. We detected the methylation status of C/EBPzeta promoter in 133 patients with AML using the methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MS-PCR) and examined C/EBPzeta transcript in 32 patients using real-time quantitative PCR. The abnormal methylation of C/EBPzeta gene promoter was found in 62 (46.6%) AML cases. No correlation was found between C/EBPzeta promoter hypermethylation and the age, sex, WBC counts, platelet counts and FAB subtypes of AML patients (P>0.05). The trend that the frequency of C/EBPzeta methylation increased as karyotype became more adverse was observed (R=0.167, P=0.075). There was a significant correlation between C/EBPzeta expression and C/EBPzeta methylation in AML patients (R=0.606, P=0.002). Our data suggest that the aberrant methylation of C/EBPzeta promoter may be involved in AML.","[""Department of Hematology, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, 8 Dianli Rd, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu 212002, PR China.""]",,,,,['Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Epub 2010 Nov 24.,"WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE: Imatinib is a specific BCR/ABL inhibitor, commonly used for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML), a hematological malignancy resulting from a chromosomal translocation that generates the BCR/ABL fusion protein. Recent studies showed that the imatinib has cytotoxic and apoptotic effects on many BCR/ABL-negative cancers. Numerous compounds with cytotoxic potential exert their functions by interfering with the DNA topoisomerase. In this study, we examined the effects of imatinib on tumour cell-killing in relation to DNA topoisomerase enzyme inhibition. METHODS: We determined the cytotoxicity by cell proliferation assay (XTT; tetrazolium hydroxide), using the human K562 CML cells, and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential by monitoring the changes in caspase-3 enzyme activity. Type I and II topoisomerase activities were measured by supercoiled plasmid relaxation and minicircle DNA decatenation assays respectively. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Imatinib-induced apoptosis and inhibited cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. We also found that the imatinib was effective in both type I and type II topoisomerase reactions to a varying degree between 94% and 7% for the concentration range of 1 mm-0.02 mm in a dose-dependent manner. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the inhibition of topoisomerases may be a significant factor in imatinib-induced apoptosis in CML.","['Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Faculty of Sciences, Izmir Institute of Technology, Izmir, Turkey.']",,,,,['(c) 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We conducted a study to determine whether these advances have improved the outcomes of transplantation. METHODS: We analyzed overall mortality, mortality not preceded by relapse, recurrent malignant conditions, and the frequency and severity of major complications of transplantation, including graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and hepatic, renal, pulmonary, and infectious complications, among 1418 patients who received their first allogeneic transplants at our center in Seattle in the period from 1993 through 1997 and among 1148 patients who received their first allogeneic transplants in the period from 2003 through 2007. Components of the Pretransplant Assessment of Mortality (PAM) score were used in regression models to adjust for the severity of illness at the time of transplantation. RESULTS: In the 2003-2007 period, as compared with the 1993-1997 period, we observed significant decreases in mortality not preceded by relapse, both at day 200 (by 60%) and overall (by 52%), the rate of relapse or progression of a malignant condition (by 21%), and overall mortality (by 41%), after adjustment for components of the PAM score. The results were similar when the analyses were limited to patients who received myeloablative conditioning therapy. We also found significant decreases in the risk of severe GVHD; disease caused by viral, bacterial, and fungal infections; and damage to the liver, kidneys, and lungs. CONCLUSIONS: We found a substantial reduction in the hazard of death related to allogeneic hematopoietic-cell transplantation, as well as increased long-term survival, over the past decade. Improved outcomes appear to be related to reductions in organ damage, infection, and severe acute GVHD.

Whereas most of the emphasis in the past has been placed on developing drugs that induce cell death based on mechanisms that do not discriminate between normal and tumor cells, recent strategies have emphasized targeting specific mechanisms that have gone awry in tumor cells. However, the identification of cancer-associated mutations in oncogenes and their amplification in tumors has suggested that inhibitors against such proteins might represent attractive substrates for targeted therapy. In the clinic, the success of imatinib (Gleevec(R), STI571) and trastuzumab (Herceptin(R)), both firsts of their kind, spurred further development of new, second-generation drugs that target kinases in cancer.

Epub 2011 Feb 26.,"Regulatory T cells (Treg) mediate amelioration of disease and immune homeostasis by inhibiting immune activation and maintaining peripheral immune tolerance. The suppressive mechanisms and clinical significance of Treg have not been completely elucidated in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Here, we demonstrated that CD127 in combination with CD4 and CD25 can identify FoxP3(+) Treg in peripheral blood (PB) and bone marrow (BM) using multicolor flow cytometry. We showed that the CD4(+) CD25(+) CD127(lo) Treg frequencies were significantly increased and their phenotypes were different in PB from newly diagnosed AML patients compared to those from healthy volunteers (HVs). Moreover, the Treg frequencies were significantly higher in BM than those from PB in the same patients. The Treg frequencies were reduced when patients achieved complete remission (CR) and were increased when patients relapsed. The Treg frequencies at diagnosis in PB and BM of patients who had achieved CR were lower than those of patients who had persistent leukemia or died, respectively. CD4(+) CD25(+) Treg were isolated by magnetic-activated cell sorting and tested for suppressive functions in coculture with allogeneic carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidylester-labeled CD4(+) CD25(-) responder cells. Suppression mediated by Treg was higher in AML patients compared to HVs. No significant differences were observed in the cytokines production of Treg, including interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), interleukin (IL)-4,IL-2 and IL-10, between patients with AML and HVs. Our study suggests that Treg may play a role in the pathogenesis of AML, and sequential measurements of Treg frequency may have clinical value in the evaluation of therapeutic effects and clinical outcome.","['Laboratory of Internal Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical College, Wenzhou 325000, China. shenghuizhang1@126.com']",,,,,['Copyright (c) 2010 UICC.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It includes the hypermethylated in cancer 1 (HIC1) gene placed telomerically to the p53 tumour suppressor gene. HIC1 encodes a transcriptional repressor, and its targets identified to date are genes involved in proliferation, tumour growth and angiogenesis. In addition, HIC1 functionally cooperates with p53 to suppress cancer development. Frequent allelic loss at position 17p13.1 in human cancers often points to mutations of the tumour suppressor p53. However, in a variety of cancer types, allelic loss of the short arm of chromosome 17 may hit regions distal to p53 and, interestingly, without leading to p53 mutations. Furthermore, the neighbouring region 17p13.3 often shows loss of heterozygosity or DNA hypermethylation in various types of solid tumours and leukaemias. In line with this concept, Wales et al. described a new potential tumour suppressor in this region and named it hypermethylated in cancer 1 (HIC1). Further, it was shown that in the majority of cases hypermethylation of this chromosomal region leads to epigenetic inactivation of HIC1. A role for HIC1 in tumour development is further supported by a mouse model, since various spontaneous, age- and gender-specific malignant tumours occur in heterozygous Hic1+/- knockout mice. Furthermore, exogenously delivered HIC1 leads to a significant decrease in clonogenic survival in cancer cell lines. This review highlights the role of HIC1 inactivation in solid tumours and particularly in leukaemia development.","['Experimental Oncology/Haematology Experimental Oncology/Haematology, MEM E829, Department of Clinical Research, University of Bern, Murtenstrasse 35, 3010 Bern, CH. m.jenal@nki.nl']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2010 Nov 23.,"Cellular energy metabolism correlates with cell fate, but the metabolic properties of chicken embryonic stem (chES) cells are poorly understood. Using a previously established chES cell model and electron microscopy (EM), we found that undifferentiated chES cells stored glycogen. Additionally, undifferentiated chES cells expressed lower levels of glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) and phosphofructokinase (PFK) mRNAs but higher levels of hexokinase 1 (HK1) and glycogen synthase (GYS) mRNAs compared with control primary chicken embryonic fibroblast (CEF) cells, suggesting that chES cells direct glucose flux towards the glycogenic pathway. Moreover, we demonstrated that undifferentiated chES cells block gluconeogenic outflow and impede the accumulation of glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) from this pathway, as evidenced by the barely detectable levels of pyruvate carboxylase (PCX) and mitochondrial phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PCK2) mRNAs. Additionally, cell death occurred in undifferentiated chES cells as shown by Hoechst 33342 and propidium iodide (PI) double staining, but it could be rescued by exogenous G6P. However, we found that differentiated chES cells decreased the glycogen reserve through the use of PAS staining. Moreover, differentiated chES cells expressed higher levels of GLUT1, HK1 and PFK mRNAs, while the level of GYS mRNA remained similar in control CEF cells. These data indicate that undifferentiated chES cells continue to synthesize glycogen from glucose at the expense of G6P, while differentiated chES cells have a decreased glycogen reserve, which suggests that the amount of glycogen is indicative of the chES cell state.","['State Key Laboratory of Agrobiotechnology, China Agricultural University, Beijing 100194, China.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The interaction between chemistry and biology not only provides new insight into the understanding of cellular activities, but also generates new lead compounds for the treatment of diseases. Transcription factors and kinases such as retinoic acid receptor-alpha (RARalpha), acute myeloid leukemia 1 (AML1), CAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (C/EBPalpha), c-myc, and c-abl play important roles in the differentiation of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. Abnormalities in these proteins may cause the dysregulation of hematopoiesis and even the occurrence of leukemia. Ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation represents a critical mechanism in regulating the cellular levels and functions of these proteins.

Chronic inflammation promotes tumorgenesis and metastasis, which suggests that anti-inflammation drugs could act as a tumor suppressor. It is known that the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) has been implicated in anti-inflammatory responses; however, the anti-tumor effects of PPARgamma have not been intensively investigated. In this study, we examined the effects of PPARgamma in cancer. We show that the activation of PPARgamma by its agonist rosiglitazone (RGZ) reduces cell proliferation rate in inflammatory and tumor-derived U937 cells. Treatment of RGZ suppresses the expression Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and decreases the production of TNF-alpha in LPS treated U937 cells. This suggests that NF-kappaB signaling may be involved in anti-tumor effect of RGZ. Our results demonstrate a role of PPARgamma in regulation of NF-kappaB signaling by modulating TLR4 expression and TNF-alpha production.","[""Hematological Department and Research Institute, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou 510630, Guangdong, People's Republic of China.""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2010 Nov 20.,"PURPOSE: The purpose of this Finnish total cohort survey was to assess and compare the self-reported health-related quality of life (HRQL) in childhood cancer survivors to that of matched controls, to analyse demographic and disease-related factors explaining survivors' HRQL, and to compare the results of two different HRQL instruments, 16D/17D and PedsQL. METHODS: Questionnaires were mailed to 384 childhood cancer survivors and their randomly selected gender-, age- and living place-matched controls. Eligible survivors (aged 11-18 years) had been treated for extracranial malignancies </=16 years of age, had survived >/=4 years after the diagnosis, and were currently free of cancer. RESULTS: Of them, 203 (52.9%) survivors and 266 (30.4%) controls replied. Survivors reported higher HRQL than their controls. Diagnostic group, additional non-cancer diagnosis, need of remedial education, and self-rated unhappiness correlated significantly with HRQL. The survivors of Wilms tumor, or neuroblastoma, had lower HRQL scores than the reference group (leukemia). The studied variables explained only 28% of the variation in HRQL scores among survivors. Instrument correlations were moderate (R = 0.40-0.65). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the diagnosis of Wilms tumor or neuroblastoma may carry substantial risks for lower HRQL. The available background variables, however, explained less than one-third of the variation in the HRQL scores. Thus, other factors than demographic or cancer-related seem to play a significant role as determinants of HRQL.","['Department of Nursing Science, University of Turku, Turku, Finland. susanna.mort@utu.fi']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In colorectal cancer, activating mutations in Wnt pathway components cause inappropriate activation of TCF4/beta-catenin-driven transcription. Despite the passage of a decade after the discovery of TCF4 and beta-catenin as the molecular effectors of the Wnt signal, few transcriptional activators essential and unique to the regulation of this transcription program have been found. Using proteomics, we identified the leukemia-associated Mllt10/Af10 and the methyltransferase Dot1l as Tcf4/beta-catenin interactors in mouse small intestinal crypts. Mllt10/Af10-Dot1l, essential for transcription elongation, are recruited to Wnt target genes in a beta-catenin-dependent manner, resulting in H3K79 methylation over their coding regions in vivo in proliferative crypts of mouse small intestine in colorectal cancer and Wnt-inducible HEK293T cells. Depletion of MLLT10/AF10 in colorectal cancer and Wnt-inducible HEK293T cells followed by expression array analysis identifies MLLT10/AF10 and DOT1L as essential activators to a large extent dedicated to Wnt target gene regulation. In contrast, previously published beta-catenin coactivators p300 and BRG1 displayed a more pleiotropic target gene expression profile controlling Wnt and other pathways. tcf4, mllt10/af10, and dot1l are co-expressed in Wnt-driven tissues in zebrafish and essential for Wnt-reporter activity. Intestinal differentiation defects in apc-mutant zebrafish can be rescued by depletion of Mllt10 and Dot1l, establishing these genes as activators downstream of Apc in Wnt target gene activation in vivo. Morpholino-depletion of mllt10/af10-dot1l in zebrafish results in defects in intestinal homeostasis and a significant reduction in the in vivo expression of direct Wnt target genes and in the number of proliferative intestinal epithelial cells. We conclude that Mllt10/Af10-Dot1l are essential, largely dedicated activators of Wnt-dependent transcription, critical for maintenance of intestinal proliferation and homeostasis. The methyltransferase DOT1L may present an attractive candidate for drug targeting in colorectal cancer.","['Hubrecht Institute and University Medical Centre Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands. t.mahmoudi@erasmusmc.nl']",,PMC2982801,,,,,,,,,,['PLoS Biol. 2017 Feb 7;15(2):e1002596.

PTK7 is upregulated in many common human cancers, including colon cancer, lung cancer, gastric cancer and acute myeloid leukemia. The reason for this up-regulation is not yet known. To explore the functional role of PTK7, the expression of PTK7 in HCT 116 cells was examined using small interference (siRNA)-mediated gene silencing. Following transfection, the siRNA successfully suppressed PTK7 mRNA and protein expression. Knocking down of PTK7 in HCT 116 cells inhibited cell proliferation compared to control groups and induced apoptosis. Furthermore, this apoptosis was characterized by decreased mitochondrial membrane potential and activation of caspase-9 and -10. Addition of a caspase-10 inhibitor totally blocked this apoptosis, suggesting that caspase-10 may play a critical role in PTK7-knockdown-induced apoptosis, downstream of mitochondria. These observations may indicate a role for PTK7 in cell proliferation and cell apoptosis and may provide a potential therapeutic pathway for the treatment of a variety of cancers.","['Department of Chemistry, Shands Cancer Center, UF Genetics Institute, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, United States of America.']","['R01 GM066137/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01GM066137/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2982840,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bone marrow-derived very small embryonic-like (VSEL) pluripotent stem cells represent a recruitable pool that may play an important role in organ repair after injury. We hypothesized that exposure to intermittent hypoxia (IH) can mobilize VSELs from the bone marrow (BM) to peripheral blood (PB) in mice and can activate distinct transcriptional programs. METHODS: adult mice were exposed to IH or normoxia for 48 hours. VSELs were sorted from BM and PB using flow cytometry. Plasma levels of stem cell chemokines, stromal cell derived factor-1 (SDF-1), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) were measured. Transcriptional profiling of VSELs was performed, and differentially expressed genes were mapped to enriched functional categories and genetic networks. RESULTS: exposure to IH elicited migration of VSELs from BM to PB and elevations in plasma levels of chemokines. More than 1100 unique genes were differentially expressed in VSELs in response to IH. Gene Ontology and network analysis revealed the activation of organ-specific developmental programs among these genes. CONCLUSIONS: exposure to IH mobilizes VSELs from the BM to PB and activates distinct transcriptional programs in VSELs that are enriched in developmental pathways, including central nervous system development and angiogenesis. Thus, VSELs may serve as a reserve mobile pool of pluripotent stem cells that can be recruited into PB and may play an important role in promoting end-organ repair during IH.","['Center for Lung Biology and UW Medicine Sleep Instiute, Department of Medicine, University of Washington, WA, USA.']","['R01 HL065270/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL086662/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL086662/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL065270/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2954693,,,,,,,,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Stem cells', 'intermittent hypoxia', 'sleep apnea']",,,,,,,,,,

It is considered that intravenous injection of such MVs or exosomes from patients would not cause severe not-self and toxic reactions. Previously, we found that macrophages take up liposome-entrapped RNA molecules, some of which remain undegraded in the cells. Here, we demonstrate that transfected RNA molecules in human monocytic leukemia THP-1 cells were shed from THP-1 macrophages as contents in MVs during incubation in serum-free medium, which shedding was shown by biochemical analyses such as quantitative reverse transcription (qRT)-PCR, expression of TSG101 (a membrane-associated exosomal protein), and immunoelectron microscopic study. More chemically modified RNA molecules (miR-143BPs) entrapped by MVs (MV-miR-143BPs) were secreted from THP-1 macrophages after miR-143BP transfection compared with the amount after transfection with nonmodified miR-143 transfection. Furthermore, we show that the THP-1 macrophages, which were transfected with the miR-143BP ex vivo, secreted MV-miR-143BPs in xenografted nude mice after intravenous injection, because miR-143 levels were significantly increased in the serum, tumor, and kidney of the host animals. These data suggest that some of the transfected miR-143BPs were secreted from THP-1 macrophages as MV-RNAs both in vitro and in vivo.","['United Graduate School of Drug Discovery and Medical Information Sciences, Gifu University, Gifu, Japan. yakao@gifu-u.ac.jp']",,PMC3034851,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Consistent retention of ABL SH3/SH2 autoinhibitory domains, however, suggests that these leukemogenic tyrosine kinase fusion proteins remain subject to regulation. We resolve this paradox, demonstrating that BCR-ABL1 kinase activity is regulated by RIN1, an ABL SH3/SH2 binding protein. BCR-ABL1 activity was increased by RIN1 overexpression and decreased by RIN1 silencing. Moreover, Rin1(-/-) bone marrow cells were not transformed by BCR-ABL1, ETV6-ABL1 or BCR-ABL1(T315I), a patient-derived drug-resistant mutant, as judged by growth factor independence. Rescue by ectopic RIN1 verified a cell autonomous mechanism of collaboration with BCR-ABL1 during transformation. Sensitivity to the ABL kinase inhibitor imatinib was increased by RIN1 silencing, consistent with RIN1 stabilization of an activated BCR-ABL1 conformation having reduced drug affinity. The dependence on activation by RIN1 to unleash full catalytic and cell transformation potential reveals a previously unknown vulnerability that could be exploited for treatment of leukemic cases driven by ABL translocations. The findings suggest that RIN1 targeting could be efficacious for imatinib-resistant disease and might complement ABL kinase inhibitors in first-line therapy.","['Department of Biological Chemistry, Molecular Biology Institute, David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, USA.']","['R01 CA136699/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NS046787/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'HHMI/Howard Hughes Medical Institute/United States', 'CA136699/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3049868,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the large MRD-based medium risk group (MRD-M; 50-60% of the patients) harbors many relapses. We analyzed MRD in 131 uniformly treated precursor-B-ALL patients and evaluated whether combined MRD and IKZF1 (Ikaros zinc finger-1) alteration status can improve risk stratification. We confirmed the strong prognostic significance of MRD classification, which was independent of IKZF1 alterations. Notably, 8 of the 11 relapsed cases in the large MRD-M group (n=81; 62%) harbored an IKZF1 alteration. Integration of both MRD and IKZF1 status resulted in a favorable outcome group (n=104; 5 relapses) and a poor outcome group (n=27; 19 relapses), and showed a stronger prognostic value than each of the established risk factors alone (hazard ratio (95%CI): 24.98 (8.29-75.31)). Importantly, whereas MRD and IKZF1 status alone identified only 46 and 54% of the relapses, respectively, their integrated use allowed prediction of 79% of all the relapses with 93% specificity. Because of the unprecedented sensitivity in upfront relapse prediction, the combined parameters have high potential for future risk stratification, particularly for patients originally classified as non-high risk, such as the large group of MRD-M patients.","['Department of Human Genetics, Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre, Radboud University Centre of Oncology and Nijmegen Centre for Molecular Life Sciences, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2010 Nov 19.,"LBH589 is a novel pan-histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor that has potent antitumor activity in multiple myeloma and other hematological malignancies. However, its impact on the immune system has not been defined. We here evaluated the effects of LBH589 on human myeloid dendritic cells (DCs) at clinically relevant concentrations. Exposure to LBH589 affected the surface molecule expression on immature and mature DCs, which was associated with DC maturation (CD83 downward arrow), antigen presentation (human leukocyte antigen-ABC downward arrow) and T-cell co-stimulation (CD40 downward arrow and CD86 upward arrow). LBH589 decreased both protein and polysaccharide antigen uptake capacities by DCs. Importantly, LBH589 impaired DC function to stimulate antigen-specific immune responses, resulting in the significant reduction of invariant natural killer T-cell (CD1d-restricted) and T-cell (major histocompatibility complex-restricted) activation in innate and adaptive immunity. LBH589 also significantly repressed the production of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-23 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha by Toll-like receptor (TLR)3 and TLR4-induced DC activation, indicating an important role of HDAC activity in immune regulation and inflammation. RelB, a component of the nuclear factor-kappa B signaling pathway, was the key component regulated by HDAC inhibition in DCs. Together, our preclinical study demonstrates that LBH589 significantly impairs the phenotype and function of DCs, indicating a need for monitoring the immune status in patients receiving HDAC inhibitor therapy. It also provides a rationale to evaluate LBH589 activity for the treatment of inflammation.","['Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.']","['P01-78378/PHS HHS/United States', 'P050-100707/PHS HHS/United States', 'P01 CA078378/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA155258/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA143748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA124929/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA100707/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3839585,['NIHMS224009'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A soluble human BAFF mutant (mBAFF), binding to BAFF receptors but failing to activate B-lymphocyte proliferation, may function as a competitive inhibitor of BAFF and may serve as a novel ligand for targeted therapy of BAFF receptor-positive malignancies. Pin2/TRF1-interacting protein X1 (PinX1), a nucleolar protein, potently inhibits telomerase activity and affects tumorigenicity. In this study, we generated novel recombinant proteins containing mBAFF, a polyarginine tract 9R and PinX1 (or its C/N terminal), to target lymphoma cells. The fusion proteins PinX1/C-G(4)S-9R-G(4)S-mBAFF and PinX1/C-9R-mBAFF specifically bind and internalize into BAFF receptor-positive cells, and subsequently induce growth inhibition and apoptosis. The selective cytotoxicity of the fusion proteins is a BAFF receptor-mediated process and depends on mBAFF, PinX1/C and 9R. Moreover, the fusion proteins specifically kill BAFF receptor-expressing Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) cells by inhibiting telomerase activity and the consequent shortening of telomeres. Therapeutic experiments using PinX1C-G(4)S-9R-G(4)S-mBAFF in severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice implanted with Raji cells showed significantly prolonged survival times, indicating the in vivo antitumor activity of the fusion protein. These results suggest the potential of PinX1/C-G(4)S-9R-G(4)S-mBAFF in targeted therapy of BL.","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, College of Basic Medical Sciences, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing, China.']",,PMC3049869,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Advances in understanding the molecular pathogenesis coupled with exciting developments in both drug design and development, targeting the initiating tyrosine kinase, have kept CML in the scientific limelight for more than a decade. Indeed, imatinib, a small-molecule inhibitor of the leukemia-initiating Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase, has quickly become the therapeutic standard for newly diagnosed chronic phase-CML (CP-CML) patients. Yet, nearly one-third of patients will still have an inferior response to imatinib, either failing to respond to primary therapy or demonstrating progression after an initial response. Significant efforts geared toward understanding the molecular mechanisms of imatinib resistance have yielded valuable insights into the cellular biology of drug trafficking, enzyme structure and function, and the rational design of novel small molecule enzyme inhibitors. Indeed, new classes of kinase inhibitors have recently been investigated in imatinib-resistant CML.

Given recent incorporation of molecular genetic findings and clinical features in the revised 2008 World Health Organization classification scheme of acute myeloid leukemia, we questioned if PEL still remains as a distinct subtype of acute myeloid leukemia. In this retrospective study, we identified 18 cases of acute leukemia with morphologic and immunophenotypic features of PEL. Following the current World Health Organization classification algorithm, these cases were classified as: 13 acute myeloid leukemia with myelodysplasia-related changes, 3 therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia, and 1 chronic myelogenous leukemia blast crisis, and one unclassifiable due to insufficient clinical information. All 16 cases with cytogenetic data harbored an extremely complex karyotype and the median overall survival of the 18 patients was 3 months (range, 1-7 months). This survival was significantly shorter than that of patients with acute erythroid leukemia, erythroid/myeloid subtype, or acute myeloid leukemia with myelodysplasia-related changes with erythroid predominance (P<0.001). PEL is characterized as a neoplastic erythroid hyperproliferation with maturation arrest. E-cadherin emerged as the most sensitive and specific marker for immature erythroblasts, and was helpful in distinguishing PEL from other erythroid proliferations. Our study showed that the criteria for acute myeloid leukemia in the 2008 World Health Organization system facilitate reclassification of PEL cases into other acute myeloid leukemia categories, mainly of acute myeloid leukemia with myelodysplasia-related changes.

The current recommendations for PCP prophylaxis are for trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) therapy on 3 consecutive days per week. Our hospital has been using twice weekly TMP/SMX for our pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) for a number of years. METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of all our pediatric ALL patients from November 1998 to November 2003. We looked specifically for chest radiograph findings, pathologic reports, bronchoalveolar lavages, or discharge diagnoses by the International Classification of Diseases, 9th revision code consistent with PCP. Those cases suspicious for PCP infection had their medical records reviewed in detail. RESULTS: Eighty-seven patients were treated with TMP/SMX prophylaxis during the study period for a total of 56,483 patient days with no proven cases of PCP. These results are similar to studies of either daily or thrice weekly TMP/SMX prophylaxis for pediatric ALL patients, and more recent studies also using twice weekly TMP/SMX prophylaxis. CONCLUSIONS: Twice weekly TMP/SMX seems to be a reasonable alternative for PCP prophylaxis for pediatric ALL patients. In review of other recent publications on pediatric patients, this recommendation can likely be extended to other pediatric malignancies as well. Further study is required to determine the appropriate length of prophylaxis and whether once weekly TMP/SMX prophylaxis or SMX alone at current or smaller doses could provide effective prophylaxis.","[""Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Children's Hospital and Research Center Oakland, Oakland, CA 94609, USA. aagrawal@mail.cho.org""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The only therapeutic approach which results in a definitive cure of patients with JMML is myeloablative chemo-therapy/radio-therapy, followed by allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation. Few cases of transformation of JMML in acute lymphoblastic leukemia have been reported. We describe a child with JMML diagnosed at the age of 4 months in whom complete remission was achieved with 13-cis retinoic acid and cytosine-arabinoside and was sustained for 7 years with no maintenance therapy. Ninety-eight months after the diagnosis of JMML was established, overt T-cell leukemia developed. Treatment with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)-directed chemotherapy induced complete restoration of normal hemopoiesis, but testicular involvement persisted. The patient died after transplantation with unrelated cord blood.

METHOD: In this cross-sectional study, from December 2008 to November 2009, all children with FN admitted to Dr Sheikh Pediatric Hospital were enrolled. For each patient, demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were recorded and they were followed up for occurrence of LTI. RESULTS: One hundred and twenty episodes of FN in 68 patients were analyzed. The most common underlying disease was acute lymphoblastic leukemia (53.3%), 9 (7.5%) died from an infection and 35 patients (29.1%) had a LTI. Five variables were identified as RFs for LTI, that is, body temperature >/=39 degrees C (P=0.000), presence of mucositis (P=0.000), abnormal chest x-ray (P=0.001), platelet count <20,000/mm (P=0.000), and absolute neutrophil count <100/mm (P=0.001). Risk of LTI was increasing according to number of RFs presented at the beginning of admission (from 2.8% in patients without RF to 100% in patients with 5 RF). Data mining analysis showed relationship between RFs with platelet count as the most important variable in the high-risk group for LTI. CONCLUSIONS: Evaluation of important RFs and judging the severity of patients' condition by studying the importance and relationship between RF at the time of admission can be a useful method for screening LTI in children with FN.","['Department of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Dr Sheikh Pediatric Hospital, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran. badieez@mums.ac.ir']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While this phenomenon is typically self-limiting and of no clinical significance, recognizing its existence is important given the expanding use of rituximab in both hematologic and nonhematologic disorders. This review discusses the incidence of LON and explores several hypotheses that have been proposed to explain its occurrence. RECENT FINDINGS: While the etiology of LON is uncertain and poorly understood, mechanisms that have been suggested include the production of antineutrophil antibodies following rituximab, the expansion of large granular lymphocyte (LGL) populations that may induce neutrophil apoptosis through Fas and Fas-ligand interactions, and aberrant B-cell reconstitution following rituximab leading to immune dyscrasias and the development of neutropenia. We explored an alternative hypothesis that LON following rituximab is caused by perturbations of granulocyte homeostasis, mediated by a complex interaction between B-cell recovery and the chemokine stromal-derived factor-1 (SDF-1). SUMMARY: While rituximab has been associated with both early and late neutropenia, LON occurring several weeks to several months after the administration of rituximab is a distinct biologic phenomenon that appears to be related to B-cell recovery. Though it occurs frequently, it is a self-limiting process and is rarely associated with significant clinical sequelae.","['Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2011 Feb 1.,"1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25D) is a powerful differentiation agent, which has potential for treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), but induces severe hypercalcemia at pharmacologically active doses. We have previously shown that carnosic acid (CA), the polyphenolic antioxidant from rosemary plant, markedly potentiates differentiation induced by low concentrations of 1,25D in human AML cell lines. Here, we demonstrated similar enhanced differentiation responses to the 1,25D/CA combination in primary leukemic cells derived from patients with AML, and determined the role of the Nrf2/antioxidant response element (Nrf2/ARE) pathway in these effects using U937 human monoblastic leukemia cells as the model. CA strongly transactivated the ARE-luciferase reporter gene, induced the ARE-responsive genes, NADP(H)-quinone oxidoreductase and the gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase heavy subunit, and elevated cellular glutathione levels. Interestingly, 1,25D potentiated the effects of CA on these activities. Stable transfection of wild-type (wt) Nrf2 resulted in the enhancement, while transfection of dominant-negative (dn) Nrf2 produced suppression of differentiation induced by the 1,25D/CA combination and, surprisingly, by 1,25D alone. These opposite effects were associated with a corresponding increase or decrease in vitamin D receptor and retinoid X receptor-alpha protein levels, and in vitamin D responsive element transactivation. Cells transfected with wtNrf2 and dnNrf2 also displayed opposing changes in the levels of the AP-1 family proteins (c-Jun and ATF2) and AP-1 transcriptional activity. Pretreatment with AP-1 decoy oligodeoxynucleotide markedly attenuated the differentiation in wtNrf2-transfected cells, suggesting that the pro-differentiation action of Nrf2 is mediated by functional AP-1. Our findings suggest that the Nrf2/ARE pathway plays an important part in the cooperative induction of myeloid leukemia cell differentiation by 1,25D and a plant polyphenol.","['Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Faculty of Health Sciences, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Petakh Tikva, Israel.']","['R01 CA044722/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA117942/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA-117942-3/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA-044722-20/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3047086,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2010 Dec 15.,"Together, circulating BAFF and dominant receptor BAFF-R homeostatically regulate the humoral immune system. Consistently aberrant BAFF-R expression in leukemic cells reveals an intimate connection of these cells' malignant physiology to the BAFF/BAFF-R axis and also provides an additional survival mechanism to the expressing cells. In this study, we used primary cells and cell lines to interrogate the mechanisms underlying aberrant BAFF-R expression in precursor B acute lymphoblastic leukemia (precursor B-ALL) and mature B chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Here we demonstrate the aberrant expression of BAFF-R in precursor B-ALL cell lines and reveal that these cells acquire BAFF-R expression through premature transcriptional activation of the BAFF-R promoter in coordination with regulatory transcription factor c-Rel. Investigations using primary CLL cells provide a crucial counterpoint through their paucity of BAFF-R relative to their benign mature B cell counterparts, which we establish as functionally significant in its depletion of the CLL cells' BAFF-binding capacity. Furthermore, BAFF-R downregulation in CLL patients is revealed here to be restricted to the malignant compartment and mediated post-transcriptionally in order to compensate for the consistently unchanged levels of transcription factor c-Rel and BAFF-R mRNA. Finally, we present evidence that CLL cells retain endogenous mechanisms of BAFF-R regulatory control despite active receptor dysregulation.","['Department of Immunology, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Rochester, MN, USA.']","['P01 CA062242/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA105258/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA105258/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA062242/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3047811,,,,,,['Cell Cycle. 2011 Jan 15;10(2):189-90.

This study investigated whether variants of 5-LO exist in human leukocytes. 5-LO mRNA isoforms that are consistent with alternative splicing were identified by RT-PCR in a cell line or cell type-specific pattern. All evaluated cells expressed mRNA containing all 14 exons of 5-LO with the expected splicing sites. Individual isoforms that retained intron 10 (alpha-10), lacked exon 13 (Delta-13), and lacked exons 10 and 13 (Delta-10,13) or that lacked the first 96 base pairs of exon 10 (Delta-p10) were identified. Immunoreactive bands coeluting with the cloned alpha-10 and Delta-13 isoforms were measured in primary neutrophils and in Raji cells. When expressed in HEK293 cells, alternative proteins were without catalytic activity. However, when coexpressed with the active full-length 5-LO, alternative isoforms significantly decreased the biosynthesis of 5-LO products by up to 44%, as assessed by reverse-phase HPLC analysis. Additionally, in stimulated neutrophils the full-length active 5-LO was detected by immunoblot in both nuclear and non-nuclear compartments, while the Delta-13 isoform was only detected in the nuclear fraction.

Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) cells resistant to the BCR-ABL inhibitor imatinib (IM-R cells) were found to overexpress SPARC mRNA. In this study, we show that imatinib triggers SPARC accumulation in a variety of tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)-resistant CML cell lines. SPARC silencing in IM-R cells restored imatinib sensitivity, whereas enforced SPARC expression in imatinib-sensitive cells promoted viability as well as protection against imatinib-mediated apoptosis. Notably, we found that the protective effect of SPARC required intracellular retention inside cells. Accordingly, SPARC was not secreted into the culture medium of IM-R cells. Increased SPARC expression was intimately linked to persistent activation of the Fyn/ERK kinase signaling axis. Pharmacologic inhibition of this pathway or siRNA-mediated knockdown of Fyn kinase resensitized IM-R cells to imatinib. In support of our findings, increased levels of SPARC mRNA were documented in blood cells from CML patients after 1 year of imatinib therapy compared with initial diagnosis. Taken together, our results highlight an important role for the Fyn/ERK signaling pathway in imatinib-resistant cells that is driven by accumulation of intracellular SPARC.","['Universite de Nice Sophia Antipolis, Nice, France.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we show that both cell lineages share increased expression of a cassette of 269 genes, most of which regulate endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi function, and they both induce expression of the transcription factors X-box binding protein 1 (Xbp1) and Mist1 during terminal differentiation. XBP1 is known to augment plasma cell function by establishing rough ER, and MIST1 regulates secretory vesicle trafficking in zymogenic cells. We examined morphology and function of plasma cells in wild-type and Mist1(-/-) mice and found subtle differences in ER structure but no overall defect in plasma cell function, suggesting that Mist1 may function redundantly in plasma cells. We next reasoned that MIST1 might be useful as a novel and reliable marker of plasma cells. We found that MIST1 specifically labeled normal plasma cells in mouse and human tissues, and, moreover, its expression was also characteristic of plasma cell differentiation in a cohort of 12 human plasma cell neoplasms. Overall, our results show that MIST1 is enriched upon plasma cell differentiation as a part of a genetic program facilitating secretory cell function and also that MIST1 is a novel marker of normal and neoplastic plasma cells in mouse and human tissues.","['Department of Pathology and Immunology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri 63110, USA.']","['R01 DK-079798-01/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK079798/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA-009547-23/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK079798-01A2/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK079798-02/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3055710,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We demonstrate that the promoter of ID4 is consistently methylated to various degrees in CLL cells, and increased promoter methylation in a univariable analysis correlates with shortened patient survival. However, ID4 mRNA and protein expression is uniformly silenced in CLL cells irrespective of the degree of promoter methylation. The crossing of ID4(+/-) mice with Emu-TCL1 mice triggers a more aggressive murine CLL as measured by lymphocyte count and inferior survival.

Molecular markers in combinations with cytogenetics have improved the risk stratification of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and informed decision-making. In parallel, several important advances in the transplant field, such as better supportive care, improved transplant technology, increased availability of alternative donors, and reduced-intensity conditioning have improved the safety as well as access of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) for a larger number of patients. In this review, the positioning of HCT in the management of patients with AML is evaluated in view of changing risk/benefit ratios associated with both conventional treatments and transplantation, and some of the controversies are addressed in light of emerging data. Increasing data demonstrate outcomes of alternative donor transplantation approaching HLA-identical sibling donors in high-risk AML supporting the inclusion of alternative donors in trials of prospective studies evaluating post remission strategies for high-risk AML. The use of reduced-intensity conditioning has expanded the eligibility of HCT to older patients with AML, and outcome data are encouraging.

Epub 2010 Nov 22.,"Beginning with imatinib a decade ago, therapy based on targeted inhibition of the BCR-ABL kinase has greatly improved the prognosis for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients. The recognition that some patients experience relapse due to resistance-conferring point mutations within BCR-ABL sparked the development of the second-generation ABL kinase inhibitors nilotinib and dasatinib. Collectively, these drugs target most resistant BCR-ABL mutants, with the exception of BCR-ABL(T315I). A third wave of advances is now cresting in the form of ABL kinase inhibitors whose target profile encompasses BCR-ABL(T315I). The leading third-generation clinical candidate for treatment-refractory CML, including patients with the T315I mutation, is ponatinib (AP24534), a pan-BCR-ABL inhibitor that has entered pivotal phase 2 testing. A second inhibitor with activity against the BCR-ABL(T315I) mutant, DCC-2036, is in phase 1 clinical evaluation. We provide an up-to-date synopsis of BCR-ABL signaling pathways, highlight new findings on mechanisms underlying BCR-ABL mutation acquisition and disease progression, discuss the use of nilotinib and dasatinib in a first-line capacity, and evaluate ponatinib, DCC-2036, and other ABL kinase inhibitors with activity against BCR-ABL(T315I) in the development pipeline.","['Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Oregon Health & Science University Knight Cancer Institute, Portland, Oregon, USA. oharet@ohsu.edu']",['R37 CA065823/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,['(c)2010 AACR.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2010 Nov 22.,"Aging is associated with the functional decline of cells, tissues, and organs. At the same time, age is the single most important prognostic factor in the development of most human cancers, including chronic myelogenous and acute lymphoblastic leukemias initiated by Bcr-Abl oncogenic translocations. Prevailing paradigms attribute the association between aging and cancers to the accumulation of oncogenic mutations over time, because the accrual of oncogenic events is thought to be the rate-limiting step in initiation and progression of cancers. Conversely, aging-associated functional decline caused by both cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous mechanisms is likely to reduce the fitness of stem and progenitor cell populations. This reduction in fitness should be conducive for increased selection of oncogenic mutations that can at least partially alleviate fitness defects, thereby promoting the initiation of cancers. We tested this hypothesis using mouse hematopoietic models. Our studies indicate that the dramatic decline in the fitness of aged B-lymphopoiesis coincides with altered receptor-associated kinase signaling. We further show that Bcr-Abl provides a much greater competitive advantage to old B-lymphoid progenitors compared with young progenitors, coinciding with restored kinase signaling pathways, and that this enhanced competitive advantage translates into increased promotion of Bcr-Abl-driven leukemias. Moreover, impairing IL-7-mediated signaling is sufficient to promote selection for Bcr-Abl-expressing B progenitors. These studies support an unappreciated causative link between aging and cancer: increased selection of oncogenic mutations as a result of age-dependent alterations of the fitness landscape.","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics and Pediatrics, School of Medicine, University of Colorado Denver, Aurora, CO 80045, USA.']","['R01-CA109657/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '2 P30-CA46934/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 AI007405/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'P20-CA103680/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P20 CA103680/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA046934/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32-AI07405/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA109657/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3003039,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2010 Nov 22.,"High hyperdiploid acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is one of the most common malignancies in children. It is characterized by gain of chromosomes, typically +X, +4, +6, +10, +14, +17, +18, and +21,+21; little is known about additional genetic aberrations. Approximately 20% of the patients relapse; therefore it is clinically important to identify risk-stratifying markers. We used SNP array analysis to investigate a consecutive series of 74 cases of high hyperdiploid ALL. We show that the characteristic chromosomal gains are even more frequent than previously believed, indicating that karyotyping mistakes are common, and that almost 80% of the cases display additional abnormalities detectable by SNP array analysis. Subclonality analysis strongly implied that the numerical aberrations were primary and arose before structural events, suggesting that step-wise evolution of the leukemic clone is common. An association between duplication of 1q and +5 was seen (P = 0.003). Other frequent abnormalities included whole-chromosome uniparental isodisomies (wUPIDs) 9 and 11, gain of 17q not associated with isochromosome formation, extra gain of part of 21q, deletions of ETS variant 6 (ETV6), cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (CKDN2A) and paired box 5 (PAX5), and PAN3 poly(A) specific ribonuclease subunit homolog (PAN3) microdeletions. Comparison of whole-chromosome and partial UPID9 suggested different pathogenetic outcomes, with the former not involving CDKN2A. Finally, two cases had partial deletions of AT rich interactive domain 5B (ARID5B), indicating that acquired as well as constitutional variants in this locus may be associated with pediatric ALL. Here we provide a comprehensive characterization of the genetic landscape of high hyperdiploid childhood ALL, including the heterogeneous pattern of secondary genetic events.","['Department of Clinical Genetics, University and Regional Laboratories, Skane University Hospital, Lund University, SE-221 85 Lund, Sweden. kajsa.paulsson@med.lu.se']",,PMC3003126,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report here a novel proteomics approach to selectively enrich and identify SUMO conjugates from human cells. We stably expressed different SUMO paralogs in HEK293 cells, each containing a His(6) tag and a strategically located tryptic cleavage site at the C terminus to facilitate the recovery and identification of SUMOylated peptides by affinity enrichment and mass spectrometry. Tryptic peptides with short SUMO remnants offer significant advantages in large scale SUMOylome experiments including the generation of paralog-specific fragment ions following CID and ETD activation, and the identification of modified peptides using conventional database search engines such as Mascot. We identified 205 unique protein substrates together with 17 precise SUMOylation sites present in 12 SUMO protein conjugates including three new sites (Lys-380, Lys-400, and Lys-497) on the protein promyelocytic leukemia. Label-free quantitative proteomics analyses on purified nuclear extracts from untreated and arsenic trioxide-treated cells revealed that all identified SUMOylated sites of promyelocytic leukemia were differentially SUMOylated upon stimulation.","['CNRS FRE3238, Institut Andre Lwoff, Villejuif, France.']",['Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada'],PMC3033685,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2010 Nov 20.,"The most common cause of cardiac side effects of pharmaco-therapy is acquired long QT syndrome, which is characterized by abnormal cardiac repolarization and most often caused by direct blockade of the cardiac potassium channel human ether a-go-go-related gene (hERG). However, little is known about therapeutic compounds that target ion channels other than hERG. We have discovered that arsenic trioxide (As(2)O(3)), a very potent antineoplastic compound for the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia, is proarrhythmic via two separate mechanisms: a well characterized inhibition of hERG/I(Kr) trafficking and a poorly understood increase of cardiac calcium currents. We have analyzed the latter mechanism in the present study using biochemical and electrophysiological methods. We find that oxidative inactivation of the lipid phosphatase PTEN by As(2)O(3) enhances cardiac calcium currents in the therapeutic concentration range via a PI3Kalpha-dependent increase in phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP(3)) production. In guinea pig ventricular myocytes, even a modest reduction in PTEN activity is sufficient to increase cellular PIP(3) levels. Under control conditions, PIP(3) levels are kept low by PTEN and do not affect calcium current amplitudes. Based on pharmacological experiments and intracellular infusion of PIP(3), we propose that in guinea pig ventricular myocytes, PIP(3) regulates calcium currents independently of the protein kinase Akt along a pathway that includes a secondary oxidation-sensitive target. Overall, our report describes a novel form of acquired long QT syndrome where the target modified by As(2)O(3) is an intracellular signaling cascade.","['Rammelkamp Center for Education and Research, MetroHealth Campus, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio 44109, USA.']","['R01 HL071789/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States', 'HL71789/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3024780,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous studies demonstrated that the phenoxyl radical of etoposide can be produced by action of myeloperoxidase (MPO), an enzyme found in developing myeloid progenitor cells, the likely origin for myeloid leukemias. We hypothesized, therefore, that one-electron oxidation of etoposide by MPO to its phenoxyl radical is important for converting this anticancer drug to genotoxic and carcinogenic species in human CD34(+) myeloid progenitor cells. In the present study, using electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, we provide conclusive evidence for MPO-dependent formation of etoposide phenoxyl radicals in growth factor-mobilized CD34(+) cells isolated from human umbilical cord blood and demonstrate that MPO-induced oxidation of etoposide is amplified in the presence of phenol. Formation of etoposide radicals resulted in the oxidation of endogenous thiols, thus providing evidence for etoposide-mediated MPO-catalyzed redox cycling that may play a role in enhanced etoposide genotoxicity. In separate studies, etoposide-induced DNA damage and MLL gene rearrangements were demonstrated to be dependent in part on MPO activity in CD34(+) cells. Together, our results are consistent with the idea that MPO-dependent oxidation of etoposide in human hematopoietic CD34(+) cells makes these cells especially prone to the induction of etoposide-related acute myeloid leukemia.","['Department of Environmental and Occupational Health, University of Pittsburgh Graduate School of Public Health, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA.']","['R01 CA090787/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA090787/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3061368,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2010 Nov 19.,"PURPOSE: Nitric oxide-donating acetylsalicylic acid (NO-ASA) has been shown to possess an antineoplastic effect in Wnt-/beta-catenin-active cancers. As chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells exhibit aberrantly active Wnt signaling, we investigated the effect of the para-isomer of NO-ASA on CLL cell survival in vitro and in a CLL-like xenograft mouse model. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Apoptosis in primary CLL cells was determined by flow cytometric annexin V-FITC (fluorescein isothiocyanate)/PI (propidium iodide) staining and immunoblotting of caspases, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), and antiapoptotic proteins. Interference of NO-ASA with Wnt/beta-catenin signaling was analyzed through immunoblots of different pathway members. Influence of caspase activation was investigated by pretreatment with a pan-caspase inhibitor. CLL-like JVM3 cells were subcutaneously inoculated into irradiated nude mice that were treated with 100 mg of para-NO-ASA/kg of body weight p.o. (by mouth) for 21 days. RESULTS: para-NO-ASA induced apoptosis in CLL cells with an LC(50) (lethal concentration) of 8.72 + 0.04 mumol/L, whereas healthy blood cells were not affected. Furthermore, the compound induced caspase 9, caspase 3, and PARP cleavage. In addition, cleavage of beta-catenin and downregulation of beta-catenin/lymphoid enhancer factor (Lef)-1 targets was observed. para-NO-ASA demonstrated strong antitumor efficacy in the xenograft mouse model with a tumor inhibtion rate of 83.4%. During therapy, no gross toxicity could be observed. CONCLUSIONS: para-NO-ASA selectively induces apoptosis in primary CLL cells and efficiently reduces tumor growth in a CLL-like xenograft model. As NO-ASA is orally available and is generally well tolerated, para-NO-ASA might be a promising new compound for CLL therapy.","['Department I of Internal Medicine, Center for Integrated Oncology, University at Cologne, Cologne, Germany.']",,,,,['(c)2010 AACR.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2010 Nov 19.,"Lunatic Fringe (Lfng) enhances Notch1 activation by Delta-like 4 (DL4) to promote Notch1-dependent T-lineage commitment of thymus-seeding progenitors. Subsequently, Notch1 and T-cell receptor-beta (TCRbeta)-containing pre-TCR complexes signal CD4/CD8 double-negative 3 (DN3) committed T-cell progenitors to survive, proliferate, and differentiate into CD4/CD8 double-positive (DP) alphabeta T-cell precursors. Few DP thymocytes develop without Notch1 or pre-TCR signals, whereas ectopic Notch1 activation causes T-cell leukemia. However, mechanisms of a Notch-pre-TCR collaboration during this ""beta-selection"" process are poorly understood. We genetically manipulated Lfng to attenuate or enhance Notch1 activation in DN3 thymocytes without inducing leukemogenesis. We show that Lfng temporally sustains DL-induced Notch1 signaling to prolong proliferative self-renewal of pre-DP thymocytes. Pre-TCR signaling greatly augmented Notch trophic functions to promote robust proliferation of pre-DP progenitors. In contrast, in the absence of DL/Notch signaling, pre-TCR-expressing progenitors rapidly atrophied and differentiated into DP thymocytes. Thus, Lfng prolongs Notch1 signaling to promote self-renewal more than differentiation during the early stages of beta-selection. Our data provide novel insights into the Notch-pre-TCR collaboration, and suggest that decreasing Lfng expression during the DN3-DP transition minimizes the potent leukemogenic potential of Notch1 signaling.","['Program in Developmental and Stem Cell Biology, Hospital for Sick Children Research Institute, 101 College Street, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['FRN11530/Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2010 Nov 19.,"An increasing body of data has demonstrated that the traditional concept of morphologic complete remission in acute myeloid leukemia, in which less than 5% myeloblasts is regarded as a sufficient response criterion, is not biologically sound. Fortunately, the quantitative reverse-transcribed polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method seems to be a promising alternative because of its high degree of preclinical standardization and extreme sensitivity on the background of an accurate day-to-day estimate of sample quality. Widespread implementation of this has, however, to some extent been hampered by the lack of knowledge of how and when to measure minimal residual disease levels and, even more importantly, how to react preemptively on a molecular relapse defined by a PCR reversal. Thus, only few prospective studies have been published to date to clinically validate this assay. Here, we discuss outstanding issues in the clinical implementation of RT-PCR for fusion transcripts, mutated and overexpressed genes in acute myeloid leukemia patients in complete remission, and propose a set of guidelines, which can be used when designing prospective trials aimed at validating the use of RT-PCR as well as for following these patients based on mathematical models for disease recurrence recently developed in our laboratory.","['Department of Haematology, Aarhus University Hospital, Denmark. phokland@ki.au.dk']",,,,,['(c) 2011 by The American Society of Hematology'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Finding such minimum gene subsets can greatly reduce the computational load and ""noise"" arising from irrelevant genes. The derived simple classification rules allow for accurate diagnosis without the need for any classifiers. This work can simplify gene expression tests by including only a very small number of genes rather than thousands or tens of thousands of genes, which can significantly bring down the cost for cancer testing. These studies also call for further investigations into possible biological relationship between these small number of genes and cancer development and treatment.

However, few data are currently available on this topic in other lymphoproliferative disorders, in particular in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to establish how many patients with CLL show a disappearance of CD20 antigen after salvage treatment with rituximab and its possible clinical significance. METHODS: We sequentially analyzed CD20 expression by flow cytometry in patients treated with rituximab in combination with other agents for relapsed/resistant disease. RESULTS: Eleven white patients with CLL (6 females, 5 males; median age, 71.6 years [range, 60-84 years]) were included in the study. Three of the 11 patients were not positive for CD20 due to complete response at baseline. Four of the remaining 8 patients (50%) lacked CD20 antigen on neoplastic cells after monoclonal antibody treatment. Two of them developed Richter's syndrome and died within 4 months. The phenomenon was transient in the other 2 patients, who were alive after a follow-up of 25 and 26 months, respectively, with CD20-positive recurrent disease. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, CD20 antigen disappearance in patients with CLL treated with rituximab-containing salvage regimens occurred in 4 of 8 (50%) tested patients, half of whom developed Richter's syndrome. [Note: Since the initial writing and submission, a third patient developed Richter's syndrome.] In 2 patients (50%), CD20 returned at progression.",,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2010 Excerpta Medica Inc.

In the present study, phylogenetic analysis on the env gene obtained from 64 tumor samples found in different regions in Japan was carried out in order to define the genetic background of BLV strains prevailing in the country. Most of the Japanese isolates were found to reside in the consensus cluster or genotype 1 of BLV strains (Rodriguez et al., 2009). Out of them, 21 isolates and 10 isolates exhibited the identical sequences, respectively. Only one isolate was classified into the different genotype related to the US isolates. Analysis on the deduced amino acids of gp51 demonstrated the sequence diversity in the neutralizing domain. These data may indicate that two major populations of BLV prevailed throughout Japan, whereas antigenic variants also exist. It was further proved that multiple invasion of the genetically different BLV strains have occurred in Japan.","['Laboratory of Microbiology and Immunology, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Health Sciences University of Hokkaido, Ishikari-Tobetsu, Hokkaido 061-0293, Japan.']",,,,,['Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Several studies have revealed strong positive associations between the numbers of tumor-infiltrating or circulating NKTs with improved disease outcome in patients with diverse types of CD1d-negative solid tumors. The mechanism by which NKTs mediate anti-tumor activity against CD1d-negative tumors has long remained enigmatic. Recent evidence indicates that NKTs can suppress tumor growth indirectly by targeting CD1d-positive elements of tumor-supportive stroma such as tumor-associated macrophages. This review summarizes the current knowledge about the mechanisms that regulate NKT-cell localization to the tumor site and their interaction with the tumor microenvironment. The discussed strategies for pharmacologic modulation and genetic engineering of NKTs may lead to development of effective and broadly applicable immunotherapies of cancer.","[""Texas Children's Cancer Center, Center for Cell & Gene Therapy, Departments of Pediatrics and Immunology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030, USA. lsmeteli@txccc.org""]","['CA 124782-03S2/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA124782/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA116548/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA126752/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA126752/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA116548/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3444285,['NIHMS402718'],,['Copyright (c) 2011.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients (2025) were categorised according to initial central nervous system (CNS) status: CNS-1 (CNS negative, n=1866), CNS-2 (<5 leucocytes/mm(3), CSF with blasts, n=50), CNS-3 (CNS positive, n=49), TLP+ (TLP with blasts, n=60). CNS-directed therapy consisted in intravenous (i.v.) methotrexate (5 g/sqm) in 4-10 courses, and intrathecal methotrexate injections (10-20), according to CNS status. Cranial irradiation was omitted in all patients. RESULTS: In the CNS1, TLP+, CNS2 and CNS3 group the 8-year EFS rate (SE%) was 69.7% (1.1%), 68.8% (6.2%), 71.3% (6.5%) and 68.3% (6.2%), respectively. The 8-year incidence of isolated CNS relapse (SE%) was 3.4% (0.4%), 1.7% (1.7%), 6.1% (3.5%) and 9.4% (4.5%), respectively, whereas the 8-year isolated or combined CNS relapse incidence was 7.6% (0.6%), 3.5% (2.4%), 10.2% (4.4%) and 11.7% (5.0%), respectively. Patients with CSF blasts had a higher rate of initial bad risk features. Multivariate analysis indicated that presence of blasts in the CSF had no prognostic value: (i) for EFS and OS; (ii) for isolated and isolated or combined CNS relapse; WBC count<25 x 10(9)/L and Medac E-coli asparaginase treatment were each related to a lower CNS relapse risk. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of initial CNS involvement has no prognostic significance in EORTC 58881. Intensification of CNS-directed chemotherapy, without CNS radiation, is an effective treatment of initial meningeal leukaemic involvement.","['Department of Pediatrics, CHU Nice, France. sirvent.n@chu-nice.fr']","['5U10 CA11488-18S2/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5U10 CA11488-40/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,['Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Spurred by the discovery of activating mutation of the JAK2 tyrosine kinase (JAK2 V617F mutation) in patients with Ph-negative MPNs several years ago, several JAK2 inhibitors were synthesized and are currently undergoing clinical trials in patients with PMF, PV and ET. Initial results from these studies have shown that these drugs can markedly reduce spleen size and alleviate constitutional symptoms, increase weight and improve exercise capacity in MF patients, thus improve quality of their life, which is significant clinical benefit. In ET and PV JAK2 inhibitor therapy may efficiently control blood cell count, as well as improve splenomegaly and control disease related symptoms. JAK2 inhibitors are a novel class of agents with promising results for treating patients with MF, PV and ET. In this article we will review the current evidence regarding the role of JAK2 mutations in the pathogenesis of Ph-negative MPNs and summarize results from the most recent clinical trials with JAK2 inhibitors in these disorders.

However, little is known about the reasons why CML patients frequently do not take their imatinib as prescribed. The current study explored CML patients' experience of taking, or not taking, imatinib therapy through in-depth interviews with twenty-one patients. Their adherence had been previously measured using a medication events monitoring device. The interviews were recorded, transcribed and analysed in accordance with established techniques. Patients revealed a variety of reasons for their nonadherence. Major themes that emerged from the data were the intentional and unintentional reasons for nonadherence. Furthermore, as a result of information received from health care professionals, several patients felt inappropriately reassured that their nonadherence would not have a detrimental effect on their clinical response. Factors that seemed to favour adherence were finding ways to deal with side effects and using prompts as reminders to take the medicine.

METHODS: Jurkat/DNR cells were cultured and identified. Human umbilical cord blood-derived stromal cells (UCBDSCs) and normal human bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) were isolated and cocultured with Jurkat/DNR cells. Jurkat/DNR cells were collected after 14 days of coculture and analyzed with regard to cell proliferation and differentiation abilities, apoptosis, drug sensitivity, and MRD1 multidrug resistance gene mRNA expression. RESULTS: UCBDSC-simulated HIM suppressed proliferation and promoted apoptosis, differentiation, and drug sensitivity of Jurkat/DNR cells more significantly than BMSC-simulated HIM. CONCLUSIONS: Both BMSCs and UCBDSCs reconstruct the leukemic HIM and reverse drug resistance in Jurkat/DNR cells. UCBDSCs reconstruct the leukemic HIM and reverse drug resistance more significantly than BMSCs.","['Department of Hematology, Xinqiao Hospital, Chongqing, China.']",,,,,['Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

The graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis consisted of cyclosporine plus a minidose of methotrexate. All patients achieved a neutrophil and platelet engraftment in a median 13.5 days and 17.5 days, respectively. The transplant-related mortality was 2 patients (16.7%). Grade II-IV acute GVHD and chronic extensive GVHD were noted in 4 (33.3%) and 1 patient (11.1%), respectively. Over a median follow-up duration of 376 days, 5 patients were alive without evidence of disease. The estimated nonrelapse mortality at 1 year was 28.4%. The estimated overall survival rate at 1 year was 58.3%, and the estimated event-free survival rate at 1 year was 41.7%.

Currently, little is known about the transcriptional regulation of CLEC5A. We identified CLEC5A as one of the most highly induced genes in a microarray gene profiling experiment of PU.1 restored myeloid PU.1-null cells. We further report that CLEC5A expression is significantly reduced in several myeloid differentiation models upon PU.1 inhibition during monocyte/macrophage or granulocyte differentiation. In addition, CLEC5A mRNA expression was significantly lower in primary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patient samples than in macrophages and granulocytes from healthy donors.

The aim of this study was to determine the mechanism of liver invasion by leukemic cells using the mouse model of transplantable myeloproliferative disease-like myeloid leukemia characterized by liver invasion. MATERIALS AND METHODS: CD45+ cells from the liver of mice transplanted with leukemic cells were sorted by magnetic separation. Gene expression alterations in CD45+ cells invading the liver were examined by polymerase chain reaction arrays and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (including polymerase chain reaction arrays) analysis of selected genes. RESULTS: Liver chemokine receptors (Ccr1, Ccr2, Ccr5, and others) were expressed in cells invading the liver. The expression level of Ccr1 was increased 149-fold in comparison with CD45+ cells derived from the livers of healthy mice. Expression levels of several genes responsible for proliferation and self-renewal were elevated dramatically, which is in accordance with a high concentration of leukemia stem cells in the livers of moribund animals. The nuclear factor-kappaB signaling pathway and several oncogenes are also activated in these leukemia cells. CONCLUSIONS: Overexpression of liver-specific cytokine receptors allowed the leukemic cells to invade the liver. The high concentration of leukemia stem cells in the liver suggests the cells of this leukemia are able to adapt to new extramedullar niches.

We showed here that conditional inactivation of Hes1, a well-characterized Notch target gene, in adult murine bone marrow (BM) cells severely impaired T cell development without affecting other Notch-dependent hematopoietic lineages such as marginal zone B cells. Competitive mixed BM chimeras, intrathymic transfer experiments, and in vitro culture of BM progenitors on Delta-like-expressing stromal cells further demonstrated that Hes1 is required for T cell lineage commitment, but dispensable for Notch-dependent thymocyte maturation through and beyond the beta selection checkpoint. Furthermore, our data strongly suggest that Hes1 is essential for the development and maintenance of Notch-induced T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Collectively, our studies identify Hes1 as a critical but context-dependent mediator of canonical Notch signaling in the hematopoietic system.","['Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne (EPFL), Swiss Institute for Experimental Cancer Research (ISREC), Station 19, 1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.']",,,,,['Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

However, the mechanism remains unknown. We identified promoters in Notch1 that drove the expression of Notch1 proteins in the absence of a ligand. Ikaros bound to both canonical and alternative Notch1 promoters and its loss increased permissive chromatin, facilitating recruitment of transcription regulators. At early stages of leukemogenesis, increased basal expression from the canonical and 5'-alternative promoters initiated a feedback loop, augmenting Notch1 signaling. Ikaros also repressed intragenic promoters for ligand-independent Notch1 proteins that are cryptic in wild-type cells, poised in preleukemic cells, and active in leukemic cells. Only ligand-independent Notch1 isoforms were required for Ikaros-mediated leukemogenesis. Notch1 alternative-promoter usage was observed during T cell development and T-ALL progression. Thus, a network of epigenetic and transcriptional regulators controls conventional and unconventional Notch signaling during normal development and leukemogenesis.","['Vascular Biology and Inflammation Department, Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Cardiovasculares (CNIC), Madrid 28029, Spain.']","['208259/European Research Council/International', 'R01 AI038342/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI038342-15/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-AI1380342/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3072037,['NIHMS254248'],,['Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2010 Nov 18.,"The world of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) research is awash with prognostic markers. However, very few of the current group play a clearly defined role in the pathology of this disease and even fewer represent a tractable therapeutic target. One such marker that fulfils both of these criteria is the integrin CD49d. This molecule been implicated in the capacity of CLL cells to migrate into lymphoid tissues and there is a CD49d blocking antibody, Natalizumab, currently in clinical trials. Here we carried out the largest multi-centre evaluation of CD49d as a prognostic marker in 652 primary CLL samples. We confirm that CD49d is predictive for time to first treatment (P<0.0001) and overall survival (P<0.0001) and increases the prognostic power of CD38, ZAP-70 and IGHV gene mutation status in concordant cases. Furthermore, CD49d retained independent prognostic significance in multivariate analysis. In contrast to previous studies, we showed no correlation between CD49d expression and in vitro resistance to fludarabine in liquid cultures (P=0.28) but CD49d(hi) cells were significantly more resistant than CD49d(lo) cells when assays were carried out on fibronectin-coated plates (P=0.03). Furthermore, we showed for the first time that the expression of CD49d is strongly associated with expression of the chemokine receptor CXCR4 suggesting a co-ordinated role for these molecules in the trafficking of CLL cells to the lymphoid tissues. Taken together, our data support the introduction of CD49d into routine immunophenotyping panels for CLL and indicate that the therapeutic targeting of this molecule may prove useful in this disease.","['Medical Research Council (MRC) Toxicology Unit, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK.']","['MC_U132670597/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'DH_/Department of Health/United Kingdom']",,,,['Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

METHODS: The clinical, pathologic and immunohistochemical findings (EliVision method) of 4 cases of blastic NK-cell lymphoma (previously diagnosed according to the 2001 WHO classification) were retrospectively analyzed and reclassified with a special reference to the 2008 WHO classification. RESULTS: The 4 cases of hematologic malignancy studied were characterized by the presence of medium-sized blastic lymphoma cells, CD56 expression, and absence of lineage-specific B-cell, T-cell and myeloid cell markers. According to the 2001 WHO classification, they fell into the category of blastic NK-cell lymphoma. Three of the cases presented with primary cutaneous lesions and expression of CD56, CD4 and CD123. They are likely derived from the plasmacytoid dendritic cells rather than NK cells. They were then, according to the 2008 WHO classification, reclassified as the blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm. The remaining case showed lymph node involvement, positive for CD56 and CD4, negative for CD123, and not accompanied with the cutaneous lesions. This case was provisionally classified as a ambiguous lineage leukemia-NK cell lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma. CONCLUSIONS: The so-called blastic NK-cell lymphomas in the 2001 WHO classification are rare and represent a heterogeneous group of lymphoproliferative disorders, with different clinical, pathologic and immunohistochemical features. It's suggested to have a precise category when applying the 2008 WHO classification to this kind of lesion.","['Department of Pathology, Beijing Friendship Hospital, Capital University of Medical Sciences, China.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most of 6 HVOD patients presented with pain in liver area, hepatomegaly on imaging, elevated aminotransferase and bilirubin (often >/= 35 micromol/L), hydroperitonia was common, one with pleural fluid, illegible hepatic veins. All the patients recovered after being treated with hepatoprotective, jaundice-relieving and supportive therapeutics, some patients were treated with low molecular weight heparin. The prognoses were good. CONCLUSION: HVOD was a serious complication of chemotherapy with 6-TG. Hepatoprotective and jaundice-relieving and low molecular weight heparin could improve the prognosis.","[""Department of Hematology, Children's Hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai 201102, China.""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We examined the promoter methylation status of SFRP1, 2, 4 and 5 in primary or relapsed AL patients, cell lines (HL60, NB4, Molt-4 and Jurkat) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy people with methylation-specific PCR (MSP). RESULTS: None of the normal mononuclear cells showed methylation of any SFRP genes. The frequencies of aberrant methylation among the samples were 33.9% (20/59) for SFRP1, 23.7% (14/59) for SFRP2, 6.8% (4/59) for SFRP4 and 10.2% (6/59) for SFRP5 in acute myelocytic leukemia (AML), and 39.3% (11/28) for SFRP1, 28.6% (8/28) for SFRP2, 25.0% (7/28) for SFRP4 and 32.1% (9/28) for SFRP5 in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Hypermethylation of SFRP1, 2, 5 genes were present in the 4 AL cell lines. SFRP4 was methylated in NB4, Molt-4 and Jurkat cell lines. However, methylation and unmethylation of SFRP4 were both detected in HL60. CONCLUSIONS: Hypermethylation of SFRP genes is a common event in the evolution of AL. Methylation of SFRP genes might serve as potential independent biomarkers for early detection of AL.","['Department of Hematology, Union Hospital, Fujian Medical University, Fujian Institute of Hematology, Fuzhou 350001, China.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2010 Nov 19.,"To analyze the effect of a splenectomy on pancytopenia after a peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients. Three CML patients diagnosed with splenomegaly in our department from 2002 to 2006 received a splenectomy after PBSCT. Patient 1, a 42-year-old male in chronic phase (CP), received an HLA-identical sibling allo-PBSCT. Patient 2, a 28-year-old female in aggressive phase (AP), received a PBSCT from her twin. Patient 3, a 26-year-old male in chronic phase (CP), received a PBSCT from an unrelated donor. The conditioning regimen included busulfan and cyclophosphamide (BU/CY2). Patients 1, 2, and 3 received splenectomies on days 168, 51, and 114, respectively. Bcr-abl transcripts were detected using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Chimerism was documented by PCR amplification of a variable number of tandem repeat (VNTR) polymorphrisms. Neither metrisone (2 mg/kg/day for 7 days), mycophenolic acid (MMF) (0.5 g twice daily for 1 month), high-dose gamma-globulin (0.4 g/kg/day for 5 days), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) therapy, nor erythropoietin (EPO) therapy had produced post-PBSCT hematopoiesis recovery. Patients 1 and 2 had 5% Ph-positive chromosomes while patient 3 exhibited graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). After receiving the splenectomy, all three had a rapid hematopoeitic recovery with no evidence of Ph-positive chromosomes, and patients 1 and 3 showed complete donor chimerism (CDC). Patient 1 developed chronic GVHD (cGVHD) on day 210 postsplenectomy that was treated successfully with prednisone. Patient 2 had acute GVHD on day 55 that was treated successfully with dexamethasone (10 mg), administered intravenously once a day for 3 days with good clinical response. To date, patients 1, 2, and 3 have survived postprocedure for 85, 49, and 25 months, respectively. Splenectomy is an effective option for the patients who have pancytopenia after PBSCT and the patients recovered a good graft function after splenectomy without procedure-related complication and with long-time survival. GVHD can develop in both allo-PBSCT and syngeneic PBSCT. A splenectomy after PBSCT may increase the risk of GVHD, enhance the effect of graft versus leukemia (GVL), promote CDC formation.","['Department of Hematology, Zhong Da Hospital, Southeast University, Nanjing, China.

We have previously found that HTLV-I p30 is a negative regulator of virus expression. RESULTS: In this study we show that p30 targets multiple cell cycle checkpoints resulting in a delayed entry into S phase. We found that p30 binds to cyclin E and CDK2 and prevents the formation of active cyclin E-CDK2 complexes. In turn, this decreases the phosphorylation levels of Rb and prevents the release of E2F and its transcriptional activation of genes required for G1/S transition. Our studies also show that HTLV-II p28 does not bind cyclin E and does not affect cell cycle progression. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to HTLV-I, the HTLV-II-related retrovirus is not oncogenic in humans. Here we report that the HTLV-I p30 delays cell cycle progression while its homologue, HTLV-II p28, does not, providing evidence for important differences between these two related retrovirus proteins.","['University of Kansas Medical Center, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Kansas City, KS 66160, USA.']",['AI058944/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],PMC3000403,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PFKFB2 (6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-biphosphatase-2), a kinase controlling glucose metabolism, was identified by us previously as a GC response gene in expression profiling analyses performed in children with ALL during initial systemic GC mono-therapy. Since deregulation of glucose metabolism has been implicated in apoptosis induction, this gene and its relatives, PFKFB1, 3, and 4, were further analyzed. METHODS: Gene expression analyses of isolated lymphoblasts were performed on Affymetrix HGU133 Plus 2.0 microarrays. GCRMA normalized microarray data were analyzed using R-Bioconductor packages version 2.5. Functional gene analyses of PFKFB2-15A and -15B isoforms were performed by conditional gene over-expression experiments in the GC-sensitive T-ALL model CCRF-CEM. RESULTS: Expression analyses in additional ALL children, non-leukemic individuals and leukemic cell lines confirmed frequent PFKFB2 induction by GC in most systems sensitive to GC-induced apoptosis, particularly T-ALL cells. The 3 other family members, in contrast, were either absent or only weakly expressed (PFKFB1 and 4) or not induced by GC (PFKFB3). Conditional PFKFB2 over-expression in the CCRF-CEM T-ALL in vitro model revealed that its 2 splice variants (PFKFB2-15A and PFKFB2-15B) had no detectable effect on cell survival. Moreover, neither PFKFB2 splice variant significantly affected sensitivity to, or kinetics of, GC-induced apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that, at least in the model system investigated, PFKFB2 is not an essential upstream regulator of the anti-leukemic effects of GC.","['Division Molecular Pathophysiology, Biocenter, Medical University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.']",['W 1101/FWF_/Austrian Science Fund FWF/Austria'],PMC3002928,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The human chemokine receptor CRAM (also known as HCR or CCRL2) is the most recently identified member of this atypical group. CRAM is expressed on B cells in a maturation-stage dependent manner and absent on T cells. We have recently shown that it competitively binds CCL19. CCL19 and its signalling receptor CCR7 are critical components involved in cell recruitment to secondary lymphoid organs and in maturation. B cell Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (B-CLL) is a low-grade lymphoma characterized by proliferative centres (or pseudofollicles). Proliferative centres develop due to abnormal cellular localisation and they are involved in the development of malignant cells. CCR7 is highly expressed on B cells from CLL patients and mediates migration towards its ligands CCL19 and CCL21, while CRAM expression and potential interferences with CCR7 are yet to be characterized. RESULTS: In this study, we show that B cells from patients with B-CLL present highly variable degrees of CRAM expression in contrast to more consistently high levels of CCR7. We investigated the hypothesis that, similar to the atypical receptor DARC, CRAM can modulate chemokine availability and/or efficacy, resulting in the regulation of cellular activation. We found that a high level of CRAM expression was detrimental to efficient chemotaxis with CCL19. MAP-kinase phosphorylation and intracellular calcium release induced by CCL19 were also altered by CRAM expression. In addition, we demonstrate that CRAM-induced regulation of CCL19 signalling is maintained over time. CONCLUSIONS: We postulate that CRAM is a factor involved in the fine tuning/control of CCR7/CCL19 mediated responses. This regulation could be critical to the pivotal role of CCL19 induced formation of proliferation centres supporting the T/B cells encounter as well as disease progression in B-CLL.","['University Clinic of Freiburg, Department of Hematology and Oncology, Hugstetterstr, 55, 79106, Freiburg, Germany.']",,PMC2998479,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This protein is structurally organized into a tripartite motif (TRIM) at its N-terminus, a nuclear localization signal (NLS) at its central region and a C-terminus that varies between alternatively spliced isoforms. Most PML splice variants target the nucleus where they define sub-nuclear compartments termed PML nuclear bodies (PML NBs). However, PML variants that lack the NLS are also expressed, suggesting the existence of PML isoforms with cytoplasmic functions. In the present study we expressed PML isoforms with a mutated NLS in U2OS cells to identify potential cytoplasmic compartments targeted by this protein. RESULTS: Expression of NLS mutated PML isoforms in U2OS cells revealed that PML I targets early endosomes, PML II targets the inner nuclear membrane (partially due to an extra NLS at its C-terminus), and PML III, IV and V target late endosomes/lysosomes. Clustering of PML at all of these subcellular locations depended on a functional TRIM domain. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the capacity of PML to form macromolecular protein assemblies at several different subcellular sites. Further, it emphasizes a role of the variable C-terminus in subcellular target selection and a general role of the N-terminal TRIM domain in promoting protein clustering.","['Department of Biomedicine, University of Bergen, Jonas Lies Vei 91, 5009 Bergen, Norway.']",,PMC2998510,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is associated with the regulation of proliferation, differentiation and survival of erythroid, myeloid and lymphoid cells, but decreases during the terminal differentiation to mature blood cells. The cellular level of c-Myb is controlled by not only transcriptional regulation but also ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis. We recently reported that mouse c-Myb protein is controlled by ubiquitin-dependent degradation by SCF-Fbw7 E3 ligase via glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3)-mediated phosphorylation of Thr-572 in a Cdc4 phosphodegron (CPD)-dependent manner. However, this critical threonine residue is not conserved in human c-Myb. In this study, we investigated whether GSK3 is involved in the regulatory mechanism for human c-Myb expression. RESULTS: Human c-Myb was degraded by ubiquitin-dependent degradation via SCF-Fbw7. Human Fbw7 ubiquitylated not only human c-Myb but also mouse c-Myb, whereas mouse Fbw7 ubiquitylated mouse c-Myb but not human c-Myb. Human Fbw7 mutants with mutations of arginine residues important for recognition of the CPD still ubiquitylated human c-Myb. These data strongly suggest that human Fbw7 ubiquitylates human c-Myb in a CPD-independent manner. Mutations of the putative GSK3 phosphorylation sites in human c-Myb did not affect the Fbw7-dependent ubiquitylation of human c-Myb. Neither chemical inhibitors nor a siRNA for GSK3beta affected the stability of human c-Myb. However, depletion of GSK3beta upregulated the transcription of human c-Myb, resulting in transcriptional suppression of gamma-globin, one of the c-Myb target genes. CONCLUSIONS: The present observations suggest that human Fbw7 ubiquitylates human c-Myb in a CPD-independent manner, whereas mouse Fbw7 ubiquitylates human c-Myb in a CPD-dependent manner. Moreover, GSK3 negatively regulates the transcriptional expression of human c-Myb but does not promote Fbw7-dependent degradation of human c-Myb protein. Inactivation of GSK3 as well as mutations of Fbw7 may be causes of the enhanced c-Myb expression observed in leukemia cells. We conclude that expression levels of human and mouse c-Myb are regulated via different mechanisms.","['Department of Biochemistry 1, Hamamatsu University School of Medicine, Hamamatsu, Japan. kitamasa@hama-med.ac.jp.']",,PMC3001421,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2010 Nov 23.,"BACKGROUND: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a hematologic disorder in dogs, but studies on prognostic factors and clinical outcome are lacking. In people, several prognostic factors have been identified and currently are used to manage patients and determine therapy. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to determine if the immunophenotype of neoplastic cells predicts survival in canine CLL. DESIGN: Retrospective study. ANIMALS: Forty-three dogs with CLL. PROCEDURES: Records of dogs with a final diagnosis of CLL were reviewed. For each included dog, a CBC, blood smear for microscopic reevaluation, and immunophenotyping data had to be available. Data on signalment, history, clinical findings, therapy, follow-up, as well as date and cause of death were retrieved. RESULTS: Seventeen dogs had B-CLL (CD21+), 19 had T-CLL (CD3+ CD8+), and 7 had atypical CLL (3 CD3- CD8+, 2 CD3+ CD4- CD8-, 1 CD3+ CD4+ CD8+, and 1 CD3+ CD21+). Among the variables considered, only immunophenotype was associated with survival. Dogs with T-CLL had approximately 3-fold and 19-fold higher probability of surviving than dogs with B-CLL and atypical CLL, respectively. Old dogs with B-CLL survived significantly longer than did young dogs, and anemic dogs with T-CLL survived a significantly shorter time than dogs without anemia. CONCLUSIONS: Although preliminary, results suggested that immunophenotype is useful to predict survival in dogs with CLL. Young age and anemia are associated with shorter survival in dogs with B-CLL and T-CLL, respectively.","['Dipartimento di Patologia Animale, Igiene e Sanita Pubblica Veterinaria, Universita degli Studi di Milano, Milan, Italy. stefano.comazzi@unimi.it']",,,,,['Copyright (c) 2010 by the American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2010 Nov 23.,"Given that aggressive DNA damaging chemotherapy shows suboptimal efficacy in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), alternative therapeutic approaches are needed. Tumour necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) is able to induce tumour-specific apoptosis. However, apoptosis might be inhibited by elevated levels of X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP). Use of XIAP-inhibiting compounds might sensitize primary CLL cells towards TRAIL-mediated apoptosis. A novel small molecule, compound A (CA), an inhibitor of XIAP, was used in combination with TRAIL to induce apoptosis in primary CLL cells (n = 48). XIAP was significantly more highly expressed in primary CLL cells (n = 28) compared to healthy B cells (n = 16) (P = 0.02). Our data obtained by specific knock-down of XIAP by siRNA identified XIAP as the key factor conferring resistance to TRAIL in CLL. Combined treatment with CA/TRAIL significantly increased apoptosis compared to untreated (P = 8.5 x 10(-)(1)(0)), solely CA (P = 4.1 x 10(-)(1)(2)) or TRAIL treated (P = 4.8 x 10(-)(1)(0)) CLL cells. CA rendered 40 of 48 (83.3%) primary CLL samples susceptible to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis. In particular, cells derived from patients with poor prognosis CLL (ZAP-70(+) , IGHV unmutated, 17p-) were highly responsive to this drug combination. Our highly-effective XIAP inhibitor CA, in concert with TRAIL, shows potential for the treatment of CLL cases with poor prognosis and therefore warrants further clinical investigation.","['Department I of Internal Medicine, University of Cologne, Germany.

HTLV-1 is spread by cell-to-cell transmission via the gp46-197 region, from Asp197 to Leu216, in the envelope protein gp46. A correlation exists between the prevalence and titer of the antibody recognizing the gp46-197 region (anti-gp46-197 antibody) and the severity of ATLL. In the present study, immunohistochemical staining was performed on samples of paraffin embedded lymph nodes of three different histological types of ATLL (anaplastic large cell type, n = 10; pleomorphic type, n = 10; and Hodgkin's-like type, n = 10) from 30 cases and 10 cases of HTLV-associated lymphadenitis. Of the three ATLL subtypes, gp46 expression was highest in the anaplastic large cell type, followed by the pleomorphic type and Hodgkin's-like type (mean: 53.4%, 34.9% and 16.0%, respectively; P= 0.0003). In HTLV-1 associated lymphadenitis cases, gp46 positive cells were rarely seen (4.0%). These results suggest that gp46-197 immunohistochemical staining can be a useful histological indicator for prediction of the aggressiveness of ATLL and prognosis for ATLL patients.","['Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, Kurume University, Kurume, Japan. jkiyasu@med.kyushu-u.ac.jp']",,,,,"['(c) 2010 The Authors.

Epub 2010 Nov 22.,"Our previous study demonstrated that annexin A2 (ANX2) on cell surface could function as a mediator and stimulate tissue factor (TF) expression of monocytes by anti-beta(2)-glycoprotein I/beta(2)-glycoprotein I complex (anti-beta(2)GPI/beta(2)GPI). However, ANX2 is not a transmembrane protein and lacks the intracellular signal transduction pathway. Growing evidence suggests that Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4) might act as an 'adaptor' for intracellular signal transduction in anti-beta(2)GPI/beta(2)GPI-induced TF expressing cells. In the current study, we investigated the roles of TLR-4 and its related molecules, myeloid differentiation protein 2 (MD-2) and myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88), in anti-beta(2)GPI/beta(2)GPI-induced TF expressing human monocytic-derived THP-1 (human acute monocytic leukaemia) cells. The relationship of TLR-4 and ANX2 in this process was also explored. Along with TF, expression of TLR-4, MD-2 and MyD88 in THP-1 cells increased significantly when treated by anti-beta(2)GPI (10 microg/ml)/beta(2)GPI (100 microg/ml) complex. The addition of paclitaxel, which competes with the MD-2 ligand, could inhibit the effects of anti-beta(2)GPI/beta(2)GPI on TLR-4, MD-2, MyD88 and TF expression. Both ANX2 and TLR-4 in THP-1 cell lysates could bind to beta(2)GPI that had been conjugated to a column (beta(2)GPI-Affi-Gel). Furthermore, TLR-4, MD-2, MyD88 and TF expression was remarkably diminished in THP-1 cells infected with ANX2-specific RNA interference (RNAi) lentivirus (LV-RNAi-ANX2), in spite of treatment with a similar concentration of anti-beta(2)GPI/beta(2)GPI complex. These results indicate that TLR-4 and its signal transduction pathway contribute to anti-beta(2)GPI/beta(2)GPI-induced TF expression in THP-1 cells, and the effects of TLR-4 with ANX2 are tightly co-operative.","['Department of Clinical Laboratory and Hematology, Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, China. hongzhou@ujs.edu.cn']",,PMC3043309,,,"['(c) 2010 The Authors.

GWB are indentified as discrete cytoplasmic domains that are involved in mRNA processing via the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway. Key components of GWB include the proteins GW182, Ago2, RNA-associated protein 55 (RAP55) and Ge-1/Hedls.

Autoantibodies to mitochondrial antigen-pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (M2), branched-chain 2-oxo-acid dehydrogenase complex and 2-oxo glutarate dehydrogenase complex (3E-BPO), gp210, sp100, promyelocytic leukaemia cell antigen (PML) and liver kidney microsomal-1 antigen (LKM-1) were detected by a line immunoassay and antibodies to GWB (GW182, RAP55, Ge-1, GW2, GW3) and glutamate receptor interacting protein (GRIP)-associated protein-1 (GRASP-1), by an addressable laser bead immunoassay (ALBIA). The most common GWB autoantigen targets were: RAP55-28%, GW182-12%, GW2-2% and antibodies to GRASP-1-17%. By comparison, the frequency of reactivity to established PBC autoantigens was: gp210, 27%; sp100, 27% and PML, 17%.

MLN8237 is a novel Aurora A kinase inhibitor under investigation in multiple phase I and II studies. Here we report that MLN8237 possessed equipotent activity against Ba/F3 cells and primary CML cells expressing unmutated and mutated forms of breakpoint cluster region-Abelson kinase (BCR-ABL). Notably, this agent retained high activity against the T315I and E255K BCR-ABL mutations, which confer the greatest degree of resistance to standard therapy. MLN8237 treatment disrupted cell cycle kinetics, induced apoptosis, caused a dose-dependent reduction in the expression of the large inhibitor of apoptosis protein Apollon, and produced a morphological phenotype consistent with Aurora A kinase inhibition. In contrast to other Aurora kinase inhibitors, MLN8237 did not significantly affect BCR-ABL activity. Moreover, inhibition of Aurora A with MLN8237 significantly increased the in vitro and in vivo efficacy of nilotinib. Targeted knockdown of Apollon sensitized CML cells to nilotinib-induced apoptosis, indicating that this is an important factor underlying MLN8237's ability to increase the efficacy of nilotinib. Our collective data demonstrate that this combination strategy represents a novel therapeutic approach for refractory CML that has the potential to suppress the emergence of T315I mutated CML clones.","['Department of Medicine, Cancer Therapy and Research Center at The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, San Antonio, TX 78245, USA.']",,PMC4394217,,,"['(c) 2011 The Authors Journal of Cellular and Molecular Medicine (c) 2011', 'Foundation for Cellular and Molecular Medicine/Blackwell Publishing Ltd.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The myeloablative standard transplantation protocol was adapted to include transfusion of gene-modified donor T cells after HSCT. Donor T cells were transduced with the replication-deficient retrovirus SFCMM-3, which expresses herpes simplex thymidine kinase (HSV-Tk) and a truncated version of low-affinity nerve growth factor receptor (DeltaLNGFR) for selection and characterization of transduced cells. Transduced T cells were detectable in all patients during follow-up for up to 5 years after transfusion. Proteomic screening for development of acute graft-versus-host disease (aGvHD) was applied to five of the seven patients with AML. No positivity for the aGvHD grade II-specific proteomic pattern was observed. Only one patient developed aGvHD grade I. To date, three of the patients with AML relapsed; one responded to three escalating transfusions of lymphocytes from the original donor and is in complete remission. Two were retransplanted with non-T cell-depleted peripheral blood stem cells from their original donors and died after retransplantation of septic complications or relapse, respectively. In one patient with CML, loss of bcr-abl gene expression was observed after an expansion of transduced cells.

This study investigated the potential therapeutic effect of STAT5 decoy oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN) using leukemia K562 cells as a model. Our results showed that transfection of 21-mer-long STAT5 decoy ODN into K562 cells effectively inhibited cell proliferation and induced cell apoptosis. Further, STAT5 decoy ODN downregulated STAT5 targets bcl-xL, cyclinD1, and c-myc at both mRNA and protein levels in a sequence-specific manner. Collectively, these data demonstrate the therapeutic effect of blocking the STAT5 signal pathway by cis-element decoy for cancer characterized by constitutive STAT5 activation. Thus, our study provides support for STAT5 as a potential target downstream of BCR-ABL for CML treatment and helps establish the concept of targeting STAT5 by decoy ODN as a novel therapy approach for imatinib-resistant CML.","['Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medical Diagnostics, Department of Clinical Hematology, Ministry of Education, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China.']",,PMC3031259,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, the disease is frequently associated with poor-risk features, such as unfavorable cytogenetic abnormalities, antecedent hematologic disorders and expression of the multidrug resistant P-glycoprotein, which are associated with chemoresistant disease. Therefore, is it not only important to develop newer treatment modalities, but also to develop and validate prognostic models to help select the patients who are likely to benefit from and be suitable for intensive therapy, and reproducibly risk-stratify (based on disease biology) a relatively uniform group of older patients onto trials, so that the clinical significance of new therapeutic agents can be evaluated.","['Division of Medical Oncology and Hematology, University Health Network-Princess Margaret Hospital, 610 University Avenue, Toronto, Ontario, Canada. karen.yee@uhn.on.ca']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Purine nucleoside analogs (cladribine and pentostatin) are generally used for front-line treatment. Other active agents include interferon, rituximab and, although rarely, splenectomy. In the series published by Zinzani et al. in Cancer, the authors conclude that initial treatment for hairy cell leukemia should be maximized since these patients generally enjoy the highest complete response rates and the longest remission durations, and subsequent lines of therapy have lower response rates and more frequent relapses. However, evolving immunohistochemical and molecular diagnostic techniques, as well as criteria for evaluating response to therapy and clinical trials investigating chemoimmunotherapy, may result in clinicians re-evaluating how patients are treated in the front-line and when treatment should be initiated for relapsed patients.","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Scripps Clinic, 10666 N Torrey Pines Road, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA.']",,,,,,,['Cancer. 2010 Oct 15;116(20):4788-92.

Epub 2010 Nov 20.,"IMPORTANCE OF THE FIELD: Retinoids are currently used in the clinic for the treatment of skin diseases and acute promielocytic leukemia and are known to contribute to early development and organogenesis in embryo and throughout life. Most of these activities are primarily due to the binding of the retinoid to the retinoic acid receptors (RARs, subtypes alpha, beta and gamma). Ligand modulates, via allosteric conformational changes, the ability of RARs to interact with different sets of co-regulators. Structure-based insights on the ligand-binding domain of the ligand-bound RARs have clearly linked retinoid function to co-activator (CoA) recruitment for agonists, CoA dissociation for antagonists and corepressor stabilization for inverse agonists. AREAS COVERED IN THIS REVIEW: To help understand ligand-modulated RAR action as a consequence of its interaction with different sets of co-regulators, we present the chemical engineering of subsets of retinoid chemotypes (rexinoids, i.e., the ligands of the retinoid X receptors, alpha, beta and gamma, with impact in the treatment of cancer and metabolic diseases, are not covered) that display the whole range of ligand functions, including subtype- and isotype-selectivities. WHAT THE READER WILL GAIN: An understanding of the correlation of retinoid ligand structure and function. Structural insights into ligand action and retinoid chemotypes. Potential for clinical application of retinoid receptor modulators. TAKE HOME MESSAGE: Potential pharmacological/therapeutic applications of these chemical tools extend beyond cancer prevention and therapy to the treatment of autoimmune and neurodegenerative diseases.","['Departamento de Quimica Organica, Facultad de Quimica, Universidade de Vigo, 36310 Vigo, Spain.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Compared with rituximab, new mAbs have enhanced antitumor activity resulting from increased complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and/or antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and increased Fc binding affinity for the low-affinity variants of the FcgammaRIIIa receptor (CD16) on immune effector cells. The second-generation mAbs, which include ofatumumab, veltuzumab, and ocrelizumab, are humanized or fully human to reduce immunogenicity, but with an unmodified Fc region. Ofatumumab is a fully human anti-CD20 IgG1 mAb in clinical development for hematological malignancies and autoimmune diseases. Ofatumumab specifically recognizes an epitope encompassing both the small and large extracellular loops of CD20 molecule, and is more effective than rituximab at CDC induction and killing target cells. Veltuzumab (IMMU-106, hA20) is a humanized anti-CD20 mAb with complementarity-determining regions similar to rituximab. This antibody has enhanced binding avidities and a stronger effect on CDC compared with rituximab. Ocrelizumab is a humanized mAb with the potential for enhanced efficacy in lymphoid malignancies compared with rituximab due to increased binding affinity for the low-affinity variants of the FcgammaRIIIa receptor. The third-generation mAbs are also humanized mAbs, but in addition they have an engineered Fc to increase their binding affinity for the FcgammaRIIIa receptor. The third-generation mAbs include AME-133v, PRO131921 and GA-101. AME-133v (LY2469298) is a type I, humanized IgG1 mAb with enhanced affinity for FcgammaRIIIa receptor and an enhanced ADCC activity compared with rituximab. PRO131921 is a humanized anti-CD20 mAb engineered to have improved binding to FcgammaRIIIa and better ADCC compared with rituximab. GA-101 (RO5072759) is a fully humanized, type II, IgG1 mAb derived from humanization of the parental B-Ly1 mouse antibody and subsequent glycoengineering using GlycoMab(R) technology. GA-101 was designed for enhanced ADCC and superior direct cell-killing properties, in comparison with currently available type I antibodies. TRU-015 is a small modular immunopharmaceutical (SMIP) derived from key domains of an anti-CD20 antibody. TRU-015 represents a novel biological compound that retains Fc-mediated effector functions and is smaller than mAbs. In this article we review data on new anti-CD20 mAbs that are potentially useful in the treatment of lymphoid malignancies.","['Department of Hematology, Medical University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland. robaktad@csk.umed.lodz.pl']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

IL-6 and brain neurotransmitter serotonin are involved in the mechanism of depression. The aim of this work was to investigat the role of protein gp130 in the regulation of expression of genes, coding the key enzyme of serotonin synthesis--tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (TPH2), 5-HT-transporter, 5-HT(1A)- and 5-HT(2A)-receptors of serotonin. The study was carried out on adult mouse males of AKR and congenic AKR.CBA-D13Mit76 strains, created by transfer of the fragment of chromosome 13 containing the gene coding gp130 protein from CBA/Lac strain to the genome of AKR/J strain. Decreased expression of 5-HT(1A) - 5-HT(2A)-receptor genes in hippocampus midbrain and TPH2 gene in midbrain in AKR.CBA-D13Mit76 mice compared with AKR mice were shown. Activation of nonspecific immunity by bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration did not affect the genes expression in AKR mice, but increased 5-HT(2A)-receptor expression in midbrain and decreased 5-HT(1A)-receptor expression in cortex in AKR.CBA-D13Mit76 mice. The results indicate: 1) the participation of gp130 in the regulation of TPH2, 5-HT(1A)- and 5-HT(2A)-receptor genes and 2) association of this protein in the genetically determined sensitivity to LPS.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

And, a 43-year-old woman diagnosed cervical spinal granulocytic sarcoma with no evidence of bone marrow or other hematological involvement is described. The tumor was totally removed by microsurgery. The histopathological examination was consistent with granulocytic sarcoma. Granulocytic sarcoma should be considered in the differential diagnosis of an epidural mass in patients with or without acute leukemia, because early diagnosis followed by appropriate combined chemotherapy and radiation may obviate surgical intervention and eventually prevent leukemic transformation.","['Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology, Hacettepe University Medical School, Ankara, Turkey. dr.songul1978@yahoo.com']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2010 Nov 18.,"Evolution of apoptosis resistance in both lymphoma and leukemia cells is well documented, and induction of apoptosis in malignant cells is a major goal of cancer therapy. Up-regulation of anti-apoptotic signals is one of the mechanisms whereby resistance to apoptosis emerges. We have previously described the fusion proteins CD40.FasL and CTLA-4.FasL, which are formed from two functional membrane proteins and induce apoptosis of activated T cells. The present study explores the potential use of CD40.FasL and CTLA-4.FasL for the killing of malignant cells of lymphatic origin. Using malignant B and T cell lines that differ in surface expression of costimulatory molecules, we found that CTLA-4.FasL induces effective apoptosis of cells expressing CD95 and activates caspases 3, 8, and 9. Only B7-expressing B cells responded to CTLA-4.FasL with rapid abrogation of cFLIP expression. CD40.FasL effectively killed only the T cells that express high levels of CD40L in addition to CD95. In these cells, CD40.FasL significantly diminished cFLIP expression. Importantly, each of the fusion proteins is more potent than its respective components parts, alone or in combination. Thus, the proteins with their two functional ends deliver a pro-apoptotic signal and, in parallel, inhibit an anti-apoptotic signal, thus optimizing the wanted, death-inducing effect. Therefore, these proteins emerge as promising agents to be used for targeted and specific tumor cell killing.","['Nephrology and Hypertension Services, Hadassah-Hebrew University Medical Center, Jerusalem 91120, Israel.']",,PMC2993309,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The cases included all pediatric bilateral bone marrow biopsies performed at our hospital spanning the years of 1992 to 2008. Agreement of FISH and classical cytogenetic results between the 2 sides was assessed. Of a total of 166 bilateral cases, 2 cases showed disagreement (1.2%), both from patients with solid tumors. One case was a rhabdomyosarcoma, in which FISH only was performed; the second was a neuroblastoma in which FISH and cytogenetics were performed (both FISH and classical cytogenetic results disagreed). The remainder of the cases showed complete agreement between the 2 sides (total 98.8%).

HoxA10 is overexpressed in a poor prognosis subset of human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and in vivo overexpression of HoxA10 in murine bone marrow induces myeloid leukemia. HoxA10 contributes to myeloid progenitor expansion and differentiation block, but few target genes have been identified that explain the influence of HoxA10 on these processes. The current study identifies the gene encoding transforming growth factor beta2 (TGFbeta2) as a HoxA10 target gene. We found that HoxA10 activated TGFbeta2 transcription by interacting with tandem cis elements in the promoter. We also determined that HoxA10 overexpression in myeloid progenitor cells increased Tgfbeta2 production by the cells. Tgfbeta2 stimulates proliferation of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. Therefore, these studies identified autocrine stimulation of myeloid progenitors by Tgfbeta2 as one mechanism by which HoxA10 expands this population. Because HoxA proteins had not been previously known to influence expression of pro-proliferative cytokines, this has implications for understanding molecular mechanisms involved in progenitor expansion and the pathobiology of AML.","['Feinberg School of Medicine and Robert H.

At necropsy, haemangiomas and some other nodular tumours were also found in the internal organs. In addition, diffuse enlargement of the liver and spleen appeared in some birds. Histopathologically, haemangiomas were typically cavernous haemangiomas and haemangioendothelioma. In the diffusely swollen liver and spleen, multifocal or widespread marrow tumour cells filled with ball-like acidophilic particles in cytosol were observed, which are the characteristic pathological changes of avian myelocytomatosis. The nodular tumour cells formed by muscle bundles were of variable size, irregular shape, poorly differentiated and malaligned. Immunohistochemistry for vimentin, cytokeratin, actin (smooth muscle) and actin (sarcomeric) and Masson's staining confirmed the different cell lineage of the nodular tumour, thus leading to the diagnosis of leiomyosarcoma. The seroprevalence of avian leukosis subgroup J (ALV-J) antibodies was 13.46% (7/52), while ALV-A/B and reticuloendotheliosis virus (REV) antibodies were not detectable. The DF-1 cells inoculated by virus extracted from liver samples from 24 infected chickens were cultured and the group-specific antigen (GSA) was identified by ELISA. All samples were positive for ALV, which was further identified as ALV-J by immunofluorescence assay (IFA). PCR analysis revealed that three isolates of ALV-J proviral sequence were close to the HPRS-103 prototype strain and other Chinese field strains isolated in recent years, while one isolate (DP01) had a lower homology with them. This is the first report that ALV-J infection caused the simultaneous occurrence of haemangiomas, leiomyosarcoma and myeloma in a commercial layer flock.","['College of Animal Science and Veterinary Medicine, Shandong Agricultural University, Taian 271018, China.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2010 Nov 16.,"OBJECTIVE: Leukemia-initiating cells can retrospectively be defined by tumorigenicity in immunodeficient mice and be characterized by surface markers. The latter still being discussed for acute myeloid leukemia (AML), nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient (NOD/SCID) mice were used to evaluate long-time reconstitution and expansion of AML subpopulations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Bone marrow cells from patients with AML were separated according to CD34 expression, aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity, and divisional kinetics in comparison to cord blood-derived CD34(+) hematopoietic stem cells, evaluating survival and expansion in NOD/SCID mice. The AML long-term surviving capacity of subpopulations recovered from NOD/SCID mice was confirmed by ex vivo survival. RESULTS: AML mononuclear cells were detected in bone marrow and spleen of NOD/SCID mice 12 weeks after transplantation. The majority of recovered cells were CD34(+) and significantly more CD34(+) cells were recovered after application of ALDH(bright) (high ALDH activity), CD34(+), or slowly dividing (PKH(bright)) than after ALDH(dim), CD34(-), or fast dividing (PKH(dim)) cell application. CD123(+), CD63(+), and CD44v7(+) cells were also more abundant after the transfer of ALDH(bright) or CD34(+) AML mononuclear cells. In the spleen, large AML cell clusters were only recovered after ALDH(bright), CD34(+), or PKH(bright) cell transfer. Importantly, in secondary long-term in vitro cultures, quite exclusively CD34(+) AML mononuclear cells survived and expanded. CONCLUSIONS: Separation of ALDH(bright), CD34(+), or PKH(bright) cells enriches for AML long-term surviving capacity, which reside in the CD34(+) subpopulation, as rather exclusively CD34(+) cells survived and expanded in vivo and ex vivo. Long-term survival capacity may be supported by CD44v7 expression.","['Department of Internal Medicine V, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.']",,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2011 ISEH - Society for Hematology and Stem Cells.

Epub 2010 Nov 16.,"The PBX1 homeodomain (PBX-HD) cooperatively binds DNA with Hox transcription factors and helps to regulate gene expression during vertebrate development. Allostery plays an important role in these interactions. DNA binding on one surface of PBX-HD enhances interactions with Hox proteins at a different interface. In addition, DNA binding causes a 15-residue extension at the C-terminus of PBX-HD to undergo a disorder-to-helix transition, although this region does not directly contact the DNA. Deletion of the C-terminal extension reduces both the DNA affinity of PBX-HD and the cooperativity of forming the DNA/Hox/PBX-HD ternary complex. To better understand the mechanism underlying these allosteric interactions, we used NMR relaxation dispersion dynamics experiments to characterize millisecond-timescale motions in PBX-HD over a range of temperatures. The data show that the C-terminal extension folds to form a fourth alpha-helix to a level of 5-10%, even in the absence of binding partners. This suggests that PBX-HD transiently preorganizes prior to binding DNA, reminiscent of the ""conformational selection"" model of molecular recognition. Folding of the C-terminal extension in the unbound protein is accompanied by structural rearrangements in both the DNA binding site and the Hox binding site, suggesting a possible role for these dynamics in the allosteric mechanism of PBX-HD.","['Department of Chemistry, McGill University, 801 Sherbrooke Street West, Montreal, Quebec, Canada H3A 2K6.']",,,,,['Copyright A(c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, we performed a prospective, sequential analysis using RT-qPCR monitoring of BCR-ABL gene rearrangements in blood samples from 91 CML patients in chronic phase (CP) who achieved complete cytogenetic remission (CCyR) and major molecular remission (MMR) throughout imatinib treatment. METHODS: The absolute level of BCR-ABL transcript from peripheral blood was serially measured every 4 to 12 weeks by RT-qPCR. Only level variations > 0.5%, according to the international scale, was considered positive. Sequential cytogenetic analysis was also performed in bone marrow samples from all patients using standard protocols. RESULTS: Based on sequential analysis of BCR-ABL transcripts, the 91 patients were divided into three categories: (A) 57 (62.6%) had no variation on sequential analysis; (B) 30 (32.9%) had a single positive variation result obtained in a single sample; and (C) 4 (4.39%) had variations of BCR-ABL transcripts in at least two consecutive samples. Of the 34 patients who had elevated levels of transcripts (group B and C), 19 (55.8%) had a < 1% of BCR-ABL/BCR ratio, 13 (38.2%) patients had a 1% to 10% increase and 2 patients had a >10% increase of RT-qPCR. The last two patients had lost a CCyR, and none of them showed mutations in the ABL gene. Transient cytogenetic alterations in Ph-negative cells were observed in five (5.5%) patients, and none of whom lost CCyR. CONCLUSIONS: Despite an increase levels of BCR-ABL/BCR ratio variations by RT-qPCR, the majority of CML patients with MMR remained in CCyR. Thus, such single variations should neither be considered predictive of subsequent failure and nor an indication for altering imatinib dose or switching to second generation therapy. Changing of imatinib on the basis of BCR-ABL/BCR% sustained increase and mutational studies is a prudent approach for preserving other therapeutic options in imatinib-resistant patients.","['Department of Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil. isbendit@usp.br.']",,PMC2995483,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The liposomes bound in a rapid and saturable manner to the human Burkitt lymphoma Daudi B-cell line and exhibited significantly higher cytotoxicity in vitro and in vivo compared with similar untargeted liposomes. The CD22-targeted liposome bound to B cells isolated from lymphoma patients and although binding was proportional to CD22 expression on the cell surface, low levels of expression on chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells were sufficient to effect cell neutralization.

Epub 2010 Nov 18.,"We have shown previously that PI3K/Akt pathway is active after cell differentiation in HL60 cells. In the present study, we have investigated whether additional molecules, such as protein kinase C (PKC), are involved in the regulation, not only of telomerase, but also of leukemia cell differentiation. We show that PKC activates telomerase and is, itself, activated following VD3- or ATRA-induced differentiation of HL60 cells, as was observed for PI3K/Akt. To clarify the significance of PI3K/Akt and PKC pathway activation in leukemia cell differentiation, we examined the active proteins in either the downstream or upstream regulation of these pathways. In conjunction with the activation of Akt or PKC, mTOR and S6K were phosphorylated and the protein expression levels of Rictor were increased, compared with Raptor, following cell differentiation. Silencing by Rictor siRNA resulted in the attenuation of Akt phosphorylation on Ser473 and PKCalpha/betaII phosphorylation, as well as the inhibition of Rictor itself, suggesting that Rictor is an upstream regulator of both Akt and PKC. In addition, in cells induced to differentiate by ATRA or VD3, Nitroblue-tetrazolium (NBT) reduction and esterase activity, were blocked either by LY294002, a PI3K inhibitor, or by BIM, a PKC inhibitor, without affecting cell surface markers such as CD11b or CD14. Intriguingly, the silencing of Rictor by its siRNA also suppressed the reducing ability of NBT following VD3-induced cell differentiation. Taken together, our results show that Rictor associated with mTOR (mTORC2) regulates the activity of both Akt and PKC that are involved in cell functions such as NBT reduction and esterase activity induced by leukemia cell differentiation.","[""Department of Hematology, Medical Research Institute, Tokyo Women's Medical University, Tokyo, Japan. yamadao@lab.twmu.ac.jp""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Specific mutations in p12 have been described that affect early stages of infection, rendering the virus replication-defective. Such mutants showed normal generation of genomic DNA but no formation of circular forms, which are markers of nuclear entry by the viral DNA. This suggested that p12 may function in early stages of infection but the precise mechanism of p12 action is not known. To address the function and follow the intracellular localization of the wt p12 protein, we generated tagged p12 proteins in the context of a replication-competent virus, which allowed for the detection of p12 at early stages of infection by immunofluorescence. p12 was found to be distributed to discrete puncta, indicative of macromolecular complexes. These complexes were localized to the cytoplasm early after infection, and thereafter accumulated adjacent to mitotic chromosomes. This chromosomal accumulation was impaired for p12 proteins with a mutation that rendered the virus integration-defective. Immunofluorescence demonstrated that intracellular p12 complexes co-localized with capsid, a known constituent of the MLV pre-integration complex (PIC), and immunofluorescence combined with fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) revealed co-localization of the p12 proteins with the incoming reverse transcribed viral DNA. Interactions of p12 with the capsid and with the viral DNA were also demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation. These results imply that p12 proteins are components of the MLV PIC. Furthermore, a large excess of wt PICs did not rescue the defect in integration of PICs derived from mutant p12 particles, demonstrating that p12 exerts its function as part of this complex. Altogether, these results imply that p12 proteins are constituent of the MLV PIC and function in directing the PIC from the cytoplasm towards integration.","['Department of Cell Research and Immunology, The George S Wise Faculty of Life Sciences, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.']",,PMC2978732,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We aimed to measure the proportion, quality and relevance of oncology-related articles, and to relate this output to their associated disease burden. By incorporating the impact factor(IF) and Eigenfactor(EF) into our analysis we also assessed the relationship between these indices and the output under study. METHODS: All publications in 2007 were retrieved for the 26 most common cancers. The top 20 journals ranked by IF and EF in general medicine and oncology, and the presence of each malignancy within these titles was analysed. Journals publishing most prolifically on each cancer were identified and their impact assessed. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: 63260 (PubMed) and 126845 (WoS) entries were generated, respectively. 26 neoplasms accounted for 25% of total output from the top medical publications. 5 cancers dominated the first quartile of output in the top oncology journals; breast, prostate, lung, and intestinal cancer, and leukaemia. Journals associated with these cancers were associated with much higher IFs and EFs than those journals associated with the other cancer types under study, although these measures were not equivalent across all sub-specialties. In addition, yield on each cancer was related to its disease burden as measured by its incidence and prevalence. CONCLUSIONS: Oncology enjoys disproportionate representation in the more prestigious medical journals. 5 cancers dominate yield, although this attention is justified given their associated disease burden. The commonly used IF and the recently introduced EF do not correlate in the assessment of the preeminent oncology journals, nor at the level of individual malignancies; there is a need to delineate between proxy measures of quality and the relevance of output when assessing its merit. These results raise significant questions regarding the best method of assessment of research and scientific output in the field of oncology.","['Department of Surgery, Clinical Science Institute, National University of Ireland Galway, Galway, Ireland. ronanglynn@doctors.org.uk']",,PMC2976696,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2010 Nov 18.,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small RNAs that control gene expression, and are involved in the regulation of fundamental biological processes including development, cell differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis. miRNAs regulate gene expression in normal hematopoiesis, and aberrant miRNA expression might contribute to leukomogenesis. Specifically, miR-21 is abundantly expressed in various tumors including leukemia and lymphoma, and is functionally involved in oncogenic processes. We investigated a role for miR-21 in Sezary Syndrome (SS), a cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) with CD4+ tumor cells (Sezary cells) present in the skin, lymph nodes, and peripheral blood. It was shown previously that SS is characterized by constitutively activated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling. In this study we show by chromatin immunoprecipitation that miR-21 is a direct STAT3 target in Sezary cells. Stimulation of Sezary cells or healthy CD4+ T cells with the common-gamma chain cytokine IL-21 results in a strong activation of STAT3, and subsequent upregulation of miR-21 expression. Both pri- and mature miR-21 expression are increased in Sezary cells when compared with CD4+ T cells from healthy donors. Silencing of miR-21 in Sezary cells results in increased apoptosis, suggesting a functional role for miR-21 in the leukomogenic process. Consequently, miR-21 might represent a therapeutic target for the treatment of SS.","['Department of Dermatology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.

Epub 2010 Aug 26.,"In this paper, we describe the use of iTRAQ (isobaric Tags for Relative and Absolute Quantitation) tags for comparison of protein expression levels between multiple samples. These tags label all peptides in a protein digest before labeled samples are pooled, fractionated and analyzed using mass spectrometry (MS). As the tags are isobaric, the intensity of each peak is the sum of the intensity of this peptide from all samples, providing a moderate enhancement in sensitivity. On peptide fragmentation, amino-acid sequence ions also show this summed intensity, providing a sensitivity enhancement. However, the distinct distribution of isotopes in the tags is such that, on further fragmentation, a tag-specific reporter ion is released. The relative intensities of these ions represent the relative amount of peptide in the analytes. Integration of the relative quantification data for the peptides allows relative quantification of the protein. This protocol discusses the rationale behind design, optimization and performance of experiments, comparing protein samples using iTRAQ chemistries combined with strong cation exchange chromatographic fractionation and MS.","['Stem Cell & Leukaemia Proteomics Laboratory, School of Cancer and Enabling Sciences, Faculty of Medical and Human Sciences, University of Manchester, Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, Wolfson Molecular Imaging Centre, Manchester, UK. r.unwin@manchester.ac.uk']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While it is known that BCR-ABL initiates the disease and that secondary molecular and genetic abnormalities likely contribute to progression of the disease to blast crisis, details regarding the mechanism(s) of blast phase progression are lacking. Two recent reports identify Musashi 2 (Msi2) as a key regulator in the progression of CML from the chronic phase to blast crisis. These reports demonstrated that the cell fate determination protein, Numb, was downregulated in blast crisis CML and that exogenous expression of Numb inhibited leukemogenesis. Correspondingly, Msi2 was shown to be upregulated in blast crisis CML and to negatively regulate expression of Numb. Exogenous expression of Msi2 enhanced the formation of an aggressive immature leukemia induced by BCR-ABL. High expression of Msi2 was also found in leukemic cells of AML patients and elevated Msi2 expression was shown to associate with poor prognosis in both AML and CML. These reports together highlight the apparent role of the Musashi-Numb pathway in regulating the formation of aggressive myeloid leukemia, and thus provide a potential molecular mechanism for the transition of chronic phase CML to the deadly blast crisis. Importantly, this work suggests this pathway may provide targets for future therapies that are desperately needed for aggressive forms of myeloid leukemia.","['Department of Molecular Oncology, Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL, USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2010 Nov 15.,"Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) is a disease characterized by dysregulated cell proliferation associated with impaired cell differentiation, and current treatment regimens rarely save the patient. Thus, new mechanism-based approaches are needed to improve prognosis of this disease. We have investigated in preclinical studies the potential anti-leukemia use of the plant-derived polyphenol Silibinin (SIL) in combination with 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25D). Although most of the leukemic blasts ex vivo responded by differentiation to treatment with this combination, the reasons for the absence of SIL-1,25D synergy in some cases were unclear. Here we report that failure of SIL to enhance the action of 1,25D is likely due to the SIL-induced increase in the activity of differentiation-antagonizing cell components, such as ERK5. This kinase is under the control of Cot1/Tlp2, and inhibition of Cot1 activity by a specific pharmacological inhibitor 4-(3-chloro-4-fluorophenylamino)-6-(pyridin-3-yl-methylamino-3-cyano-[1-7]-naphth yridine, or by Cot1 siRNA, increases the differentiation by SIL/1,25D combinations. Conversely, over-expression of a Cot1 construct increases the cellular levels of P-ERK5, and SIL/1,25D-induced differentiation and cell cycle arrest are diminished. It appears that reduction in ERK5 activity by inhibition of Cot1 allows SIL to augment the expression of 1,25D-induced differentiation promoting factors and cell cycle regulators such as p27 (Kip1) , which leads to cell cycle arrest. This study shows that in some cell contexts SIL/1,25D can promote expression of both differentiation-promoting and differentiation-inhibiting genes, and that the latter can be neutralized by a highly specific pharmacological inhibitor, suggesting a potential for supplementing treatment of AML with this combination of agents.","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, New Jersey Medical School, University of Medicine and Dentistry New Jersey, Newark, USA.']","['R01-CA-117942-3/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA044722/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA117942/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA44722/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA044722-21/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3048050,,,,,,['Cell Cycle. 2010 Dec 1;9(23):4612-3.

Although complete hematologic responses (CHR) were achieved, we replaced imatinib with hydroxycarbamide (HU) because of the renal dysfunction possibly due to imatinib. However, since the blood count was poorly controlled with HU, treatment with dasatinib, one of the second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors, was started at the accelerated phase (AP) in June 2009. Dasatinib was given in a daily dose of 20 mg, intending dose escalation after confirmation of its safety. White blood cells and platelets decreased rapidly, and after 18 days, CHR was achieved. Thereafter, daily dasatinib was reduced twice per week because of the cytopenia. However, the patient has continued CHR without developing AP for more than six months.

Epub 2010 Nov 17.,"A novel gammaretrovirus, xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus (XMRV), has been identified in patients with prostate cancer and in patients with chronic fatigue syndromes. Standard Mus musculus laboratory mice lack a functional XPR1 receptor for XMRV and are therefore not a suitable model for the virus. In contrast, Gairdner's shrew-mice (Mus pahari) do express functional XPR1. To determine whether Mus pahari could serve as a model for XMRV, primary Mus pahari fibroblasts and mice were infected with cell-free XMRV. Infection of cells in vitro resulted in XMRV Gag expression and the production of XMRV virions. After intraperitoneal injection of XMRV into Mus pahari mice, XMRV proviral DNA could be detected in spleen, blood, and brain. Intravenous administration of a green fluorescent protein (GFP) vector pseudotyped with XMRV produced GFP(+) CD4(+) T cells and CD19(+) B cells. Mice mounted adaptive immune responses against XMRV, as evidenced by the production of neutralizing and Env- and Gag-specific antibodies. Prominent G-to-A hypermutations were also found in viral genomes isolated from the spleen, suggesting intracellular restriction of XMRV infection by APOBEC3 in vivo. These data demonstrate infection of Mus pahari by XMRV, potential cell tropism of the virus, and immunological and intracellular restriction of virus infection in vivo. These data support the use of Mus pahari as a model for XMRV pathogenesis and as a platform for vaccine and drug development against this potential human pathogen.","['Department of Molecular Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Guggenheim 18-11c, 200 First Street, SW, Rochester, MN 55905, USA.']","['R56 AI074363-01A1/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R56AI074363/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R56 AI074363/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 AI093186/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA91956-080013/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3020513,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2010 Nov 17.,"Glucocorticoid (GC) steroid hormones induce apoptosis in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Autoup-regulation of human GC receptor (hGR) levels is associated with sensitivity to GC-mediated apoptosis. Among the major hGR promoters expressed in 697 pre-B-ALL cells (1A, 1B, 1C, and 1D), only promoters 1C and 1D are selectively activated by the hormone. Promoter 1B is unresponsive, and promoter 1A is down-regulated by dexamethasone (Dex) in 697 cells, whereas they are both up-regulated in CEM-C7 T-ALL cells. Autoup-regulation of promoter 1C and 1D in 697 cells requires sequences containing GC response units (GRUs) (1C GRU, -2915/-2956; 1D GRU, -4525/-4559) that were identified previously in CEM-C7 cells. These GRUs potentially bind GR, c-myeloblastosis (c-Myb), and E-twenty six (Ets) proteins; 697 cells express high levels of c-Myb protein, as well as the E-twenty six family protein members, PU.1 and Spi-B. Dex treatment in 697 cells elevates the expression of c-Myb and decreases levels of both Spi-B and PU.1. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed the specific recruitment of GR, c-Myb, and cAMP response element-binding protein binding protein to the 1C and 1D GRUs upon Dex treatment, correlating to observed autoup-regulated activity in these two promoters. These data suggest a hormone activated, lineage-specific mechanism to control the autoup-regulation of hGR gene expression in 697 pre-B-ALL cells via steroid-mediated changes in GR coregulator expression. These findings may be helpful in understanding the mechanism that determines the sensitivity of B-ALL leukemia cells to hormone-induced apoptosis.","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center, 1901 Perdido Street, New Orleans, LA 70112, USA.']","['R01 CA116042/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA116042/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3033051,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: BMSCs from children with acute leukemia-were isolated by human lymphocyte separation medium. BMSCs (adherent) and leukemia cells (suspended) were cultured in vitro. This study included four groups: leukemia cells alone (control), leukemia cells+BMSCs, leukemia cells+BMSCs supernatant and leukemia cells+BMSCs+VLA-4 antibody. The apoptosis rate of leukemia cells in the four groups was determined by Annexin -FITC double-labeled flow cytometry. The expression of survivin and bcl-2 genes in leukemia cells was ascertained by RT-PCR. RESULTS: The apoptosis rate of leukemia cells in the leukemia cells+BMSCs and the leukemia cells+BMSCs supernatant groups was lower than that in the control group (P<0.05). Compared with the leukemia cells+BMSCs and the leukemia cells+BMSCs supernatant groups, the apoptosis rate of leukemia cells in the VLA-4 antibody group increased significantly (P<0.05). In the VLA-4 antibody group, the apoptosis rate of leukemia cells increased with prolonged culture time. There were significant differences in the apoptosis rate between 12 hrs and 24 hrs after VLA-4 antibody treatment (P<0.01). The expression of survivin and bcl-2 genes in leukemia cells from the VLA-4 antibody groups was reduced compared with that from the leukemia cells+BMSCs and the leukemia cells+BMSCs supernatant groups (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: BMSCs play protective roles on leukemia cells.

In this study we investigate the potential and mechanism of using rapamycin to restore the sensitivity of GC-resistant T-ALL cells to dexamethasone (Dex) treatment. METHODS: Cell proliferation was detected by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)- 2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis was used to analyze apoptosis and cell cycles. Western blot analysis was performed to test the expression of the downstream effector proteins of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), the cell cycle regulatory proteins, and apoptosis associated proteins. RESULTS: 10 nM rapamycin markedly increased GC sensitivity in GC-resistant T-ALL cells and this effect was mediated, at least in part, by inhibition of mTOR signaling pathway. Cell cycle arrest was associated with modulation of G1-S phase regulators. Both rapamycin and Dex can induce up-regulation of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors of p21 and p27 and co-treatment of rapamycin with Dex resulted in a synergistic induction of their expressions. Rapamycin did not obviously affect the expression of cyclin A, whereas Dex induced cyclin A expression. Rapamycin prevented Dex-induced expression of cyclin A. Rapamycin had a stronger inhibition of cyclin D1 expression than Dex. Rapamycin enhanced GC-induced apoptosis and this was not achieved by modulation of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) expression, but synergistically up-regulation of pro-apoptotic proteins like caspase-3, Bax, and Bim, and down-regulation of anti-apoptotic protein of Mcl-1. CONCLUSION: Our data suggests that rapamycin can effectively reverse GC resistance in T-ALL and this effect is achieved by inducing cell cycles arrested at G0/G1 phase and activating the intrinsic apoptotic program. Therefore, combination of mTOR inhibitor rapamycin with GC containing protocol might be an attracting new therapeutic approach for GC resistant T-ALL patients.","['Department of Pediatrics, West China Second University Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.']",,PMC2998469,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2010 Nov 18.,"Defects in the DNA damage response pathway [e.g. del(17p)] are associated with drug-resistant B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). We previously demonstrated that over-expression of DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) correlates with chemo-resistance and that inhibition of DNA-PK sensitizes CLL cells to chemotherapeutics. Here, we investigated expression of DNA-PK and other proteins that impact on drug resistance, and evaluated the effects of a DNA-PK inhibitor (NU7441) on mitoxantrone-induced cytotoxicity in CLL cells. NU7441 sensitized cells from 42/49 CLL samples to mitoxantrone, with sensitization ranging from 2- to 200-fold Co-culture of CLL cells in conditioned stromal medium increased chemoresistance but did not reduce sensitization by NU7441. Mitoxantrone treatment induced gammaH2AX foci and NU7441 increased their longevity (24 h). NU7441 prevented mitoxantrone-induced autophosphorylation of the DNA-PK catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) at Ser 2056, confirming that DNA-PK participates in repair of mitoxantrone-induced DNA damage. del(17p) cases were more resistant to mitoxantrone than del(13q) cases, but were resensitized (7-16 fold) by co-incubation with NU7441. Expression of DNA-PKcs, Ku80, P-glycoprotein and topoisomerase IIbeta were significantly higher in del(17p) cases. PRKDC mRNA levels correlated with DNA-PKcs protein expression, which predicted shorter survival. These data confirm the potential of DNA-PK as a therapeutic target in poor prognosis CLL.","['Newcastle Cancer Centre at the NorthernInstitute for Cancer Research, Medical School, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK.']",,,,,['(c) 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the current WHO classification, they are categorized as extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type and aggressive NK-cell leukemia. NK-cell malignancies show a geographical predilection for Asian and South American populations and are rare in the west. Pathologically, NK-cell lymphomas show a polymorphic neoplastic infiltrate with angioinvasion and angiodestruction. The lymphoma cells are CD2(+), cytoplasmic CD3epsilon(+) and CD56(+), with germline T-cell receptor gene. There is an almost invariable clonal episomal infection with Epstein-Barr virus. Clinically, NK-cell lymphomas can be classified into nasal, non-nasal and aggressive lymphoma/leukemia subtypes. Most nasal NK-cell lymphomas present with stage I/II disease. The early use of radiotherapy, either alone or concomitantly/sequentially with chemotherapy, is the most important factor in achieving successful treatment. Many stage I/II patients receiving radiotherapy alone fail systemically, so the use of chemotherapy is also considered necessary. Chemotherapy is indicated for stage III/IV nasal NK-cell lymphoma, and the non-nasal and aggressive subtypes. Recent regimens that incorporate the use of L-asparaginase have resulted in substantial improvements in outcome in high-risk, refractory or relapsed patients. High-dose chemotherapy and hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation with autologous or allogeneic hematopoietic stem cells may be beneficial to selected patients. Prognostication of patients with clinical prognostic models and presentation circulating Epstein-Barr DNA load may be useful in the stratification of patients for various treatment modalities.","['Shinshu University School of Medicine, Matsumoto, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite being synthesized approximately 40 years ago it has only recently been employed with success at low doses in the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). This drug has hypomethylating activity and, possibly, exerts its action by reinducing expression of genes silenced by the hypermethylation of CpG islands in their promoters. Azacitidine is administered prevalently subcutaneously (75 mg/m(2)/day for 7 days every 28 days) as the pharmacokinetics and pharmacoavailability are almost equivalent to the intravenous route. It was the first agent demonstrated to delay acute myeloblastic leukemia transformation and to prolong survival for patients with higher risk MDS, and it was approved in 2004 by the US FDA for treatment of all MDS risk categories. Azacitidine allows transfusion independence in more than 40% of treated MDS patients, and has opened a new era in the treatment of MDS and the use of 'epigenetic drugs'. To correctly use this agent and obtain hematological improvements that lead to a prolonged overall survival of MDS patients, hematologists have to modify their perspective and their usual expectations from a chemotherapy-like regimen. Azacitidine may also be administered quite safely to elderly patients presenting comorbidities and it is well tolerated in an out-patient regimen.

Epub 2011 Jan 5.,"The Hox family are master transcriptional regulators of developmental processes, including hematopoiesis. The Hox regulators, caudal homeobox factors (Cdx1-4), and Meis1, along with several individual Hox proteins, are implicated in stem cell expansion during embryonic development, with gene dosage playing a significant role in the overall function of the integrated Hox network. To investigate the role of this network in normal and aberrant, early hematopoiesis, we employed an in vitro embryonic stem cell differentiation system, which recapitulates mouse developmental hematopoiesis. Expression profiles of Hox, Pbx1, and Meis1 genes were quantified at distinct stages during the hematopoietic differentiation process and compared with the effects of expressing the leukemic oncogene Tel/PDGFRbeta. During normal differentiation the Hoxa cluster, Pbx1 and Meis1 predominated, with a marked reduction in the majority of Hox genes (27/39) and Meis1 occurring during hematopoietic commitment. Only the posterior Hoxa cluster genes (a9, a10, a11, and a13) maintained or increased expression at the hematopoietic colony stage. Cdx4, Meis1, and a subset of Hox genes, including a7 and a9, were differentially expressed after short-term oncogenic (Tel/PDGFRbeta) induction. Whereas Hoxa4-10, b1, b2, b4, and b9 were upregulated during oncogenic driven myelomonocytic differentiation. Heterodimers between Hoxa7/Hoxa9, Meis1, and Pbx have previously been implicated in regulating target genes involved in hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) expansion and leukemic progression. These results provide direct evidence that transcriptional flux through the Hox network occurs at very early stages during hematopoietic differentiation and validates embryonic stem cell models for gaining insights into the genetic regulation of normal and malignant hematopoiesis.","[""Paul O'Gorman Leukaemia Research Centre, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom.""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In a country with limited resources like Sudan, such expensive therapy is not available. Alternative approaches are needed to help these children. The tyrosine kinase inhibitor-imatinib-might be an answer to this problem. The objective of this study is to determine the pattern of children with CML, their hematological response to imatinib, and tolerance and side effects to this drug. All patients with confirmed BCR-ABL by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were included in this study. The relevant data were collected and the patients were started on imatinib. Response to treatment was assessed clinically and hematologically only. Cytogenetics and molecular studies are not available. The average age of the 31 patient evaluated was 8.7 years, 2 patients were less than 1 year, and 5 patients, ie, 16%, were 2 years old or less. Chloroma was observed in 6 (19%) patients. The average of the white blood cell (WBC) count was 206.6 x 10(9)/L and the platelet count average was 523 x 10(9)/L. Two (6.5%) of the 31 patients presented as acute myeloid leukemia (AML). All patients had hematological remission within 2 months. Twenty-three (74%) had a sustained remission over an average follow-up period of 26 months (2-67 months). Six (19%) patients died with AML or sepsis. Side effects to imatinib were infrequent, observed in 4 out of 29 (13.7%) patients, and mild. One patient only needed dose modification. No resistance was observed during this period. CML patients present at an earlier age than in other parts of the world. Imatinib is safe and effective in treating pediatric CML where stem cell transplant in not available. Further cytogenetics are important to monitor response and proper management.","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Khartoum, Khartoum, Sudan. alkhatibmohammed@hotmail.com']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Organ systems typically involved are the bone marrow, skin, liver and gastrointestinal tract. In most adult patients, the systemic form of mastocytosis (SM) is diagnosed, which includes an indolent subvariant, an aggressive subvariant and a leukemic subvariant, also termed MC leukemia. Whereas in pediatric mastocytosis, which is usually confined to the skin, a number of different KIT mutations and other defects may be detected, the KIT mutation D816V is detectable in most (adult) patients with SM. In a subset of these patients, additional oncogenic factors may lead to enhanced survival and growth of MCs and, thus, to advanced SM. Other factors may lead to MC activation, with consecutive anaphylactic reactions that can be severe or even fatal. Treatment of SM usually focuses on symptom relief by histamine receptor antagonists and other supportive therapy. However, in aggressive and leukemic variants, cytoreductive and targeted drugs must be applied. Unfortunately, the prognosis in these patients remains poor, even when treated with novel KIT-targeting agents, polychemotherapy or stem cell transplantation.

It adds metabolic and functional information to conventional anatomical imaging, mainly assessed by CT. Especially for the detection of early response to treatment and prognostic considerations, this type of information seems better suited than anatomical information. Consequently, the ability of FDG PET to predict the outcome in patients with stem cell transplantation (SCT) for lymphoma has been tested in several studies. Results in patients with autologous SCT have been promising, and pretransplant FDG PET is likely to become routine in this group of patients. The evaluated study investigates, for the first time, the predictive value of pretransplant FDG PET in allogeneic SCT, as well as the utility of FDG PET for the follow-up of these patients. All 80 patients included in the prospective study had reduced-intensity conditioning. In contrast to FDG PET before autologous SCT, there was no correlation at all between pretransplant FDG PET results and the outcome after allogeneic SCT. This reflects the fact that other or additional reasons, especially the graft-versus-leukemia effect, are substantial for the outcome of allogeneic SCT in comparison with autologous SCT. Follow-up with FDG PET after reduced-intensity allogeneic SCT was significantly more sensitive than CT to detect disease progression or relapse, and was useful in guiding treatment in the situation of disease relapse.","['Medical University of Vienna, Wahringer Gurtel 18-20, A-1090 Vienna, Austria. kurt.kletter@meduniwien.ac.at']",,,,,,,['Blood. 2010 Apr 8;115(14):2763-8.

The major focus was hematological malignancies, not only LLM, but also myeloproliferative disorders and myelodysplastic syndromes. The target audience was hematologists, oncologists and those involved in stem cell transplantation. The congress was held over 2 and a half days and attended by more than 350 participants from 25 different countries. The scientific program was shaped by 12 distinguished international speakers, who co-chaired and designed the sessions. The majority of the hematologists are caring for malignant patients and the Congress was a great opportunity for participants to get the latest update before the American Society of Clinical Oncology and American Society of Hematology 2009 official meeting.

However, emergence of resistance to IM became a major therapeutic challenge. Bosutinib (SKI-606), a 7-alkoxy-3-quinolinecarbonitrile, functions as a dual inhibitor of SRC and ABL kinases, and preclinical studies demonstrated a high antiproliferative activity in human and murine CML cell lines. In ongoing Phase I/II clinical trials, bosutinib yielded promising results revealing high clinical efficacy, good tolerability and reduced toxicity in IM-resistant or -intolerant CML patients. In this article, we provide an overview on the mechanism of action, and the preclinical and currently available clinical data for bosutinib. Owing to its favorable toxicity profile and its high antileukemic activity, bosutinib is a promising novel treatment option for patients with CML. A recently initiated, randomized open-label Phase III clinical study will clarify its role in first-line therapy of Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic-phase CML.","['Klinik fur Hamatologie und Onkologie mit der Sektion Pneumologie, Universitares Cancer Center Hamburg (UCCH), Universitats-Klinikum Hamburg-Eppendorf, Martinistrasse 52, Hamburg, Germany. g.keller@uke.uni-hamburg.de']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Laromustine is metabolized to yield 90CE and methylisocyanate, the former rapidly produces an alkylating, chloroethylating species, similar to the chloroethylating species generated by carmustine. However, several features distinguish laromustine from carmustine and possibly account for their biological differences in vitro and in vivo. The chloroethylating species responsible for laromustine's alkylator effect is relatively specific for guanine and forms a crosslink after incorporation into DNA. Laromustine has significant activity in both older patients with previously untreated acute myeloid leukemia or high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome, including those with very poor-risk disease, and in patients with relapsed disease. Further clinical studies are required with laromustine to evaluate its place as an anticancer agent in other hematological malignancies.","['Institute for Drug Development, Cancer Therapy and Research Center at the UT Health Science Center, University of Texas, San Antonio, TX 78229, USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unprecedented clinical activity in CML led to rapid approval and established first-line therapy with imatinib mesylate as the standard of care in most patients. However, the occurrence of imatinib resistance or intolerance has sparked the development of newer drugs with increased activity or specificity.

The clinical management and prognosis of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) has substantially changed after the introduction of targeted therapies, such as imatinib and the second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors nilotinib and dasatinib. Although exact characterization of CML pathogenetics has been performed by showing the causal pathogenetic relevance of the reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22 for CML development, the disease still exhibits a marked clinical and biological heterogenicity. Thus, prognostic scores for a more exact disease classification, as well as for prediction of response to tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy are warranted, especially because scores established within the interferon era have lost their prognostic value when applied to patients treated with imatinib. Gene-expression profiling has been proven to represent a powerful tool for early identification of nonresponders to cancer therapy. Several profiling studies in CML have been reported thus far. However, the available data are inconsistent, which is mainly due to technical reasons, such as the use of various different chips, different biostatistical algorithms for data analysis and, most importantly, the use of various different cellular sources (i.e., mononuclear cells from peripheral blood, whole bone marrow cells or selected bone marrow-derived stem/progenitor cells). This review will summarize the recent literature on gene-expression profiling for CML classification and response prediction.","['Tyrolean Cancer Research Institute and Department of Internal Medicine V, Haematology and Oncology, Medical University Innsbruck, Anichstrasse 35, Innsbruck, Austria.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The results of conventional treatment are considered unsatisfactory in aggressive forms, with subsets of patients having short life expectancies. Relying on wide experimental evidence and more feeble clinical data, some research groups have used autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in the most disabling autoimmune diseases with the aim of resetting the patient's immune system. Immunoablative conditioning regimens are preferred over their myeloablative counterparts, and some form of in vivo and/or ex vivo T-cell depletion is generally adopted. Despite 15 years' experience, published controlled clinical trials are still lacking, with the evidence so far available coming from pilot studies and registry surveys. In multiple sclerosis, clinical improvement, or at least lasting disease stabilization, can be achieved in the majority of the patients; nevertheless, the worst results are observed in patients with progressive disease, where no benefit can be expected from conventional therapy. Concerning rheumatologic diseases, wide experience has been acquired in systemic sclerosis, with long-term improvements in cutaneous disease being frequently reported, although visceral involvement remains unchanged at best. Autografting has proved to be barely effective in rheumatoid arthritis and quite toxic in juvenile idiopathic arthritis, whereas it leads to clinical remission and the reversal of visceral impairment in the majority of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. A promising indication is Crohn's disease, in which long-term endoscopic remission is frequently observed. Growing experience with autologous HCST in autoimmune diseases has progressively reduced concerns about transplant-related mortality and secondary myelodysplasia/leukemia. Therefore, a sustained complete remission seems to be within the reach of autografting in some autoimmune diseases; in others, the indications, risks and benefits of autografting need to be better defined. Consequently, the search for new drugs should also be encouraged.","['Bone Marrow Transplantation Center-Hematology I, Fondazione Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Mangiagalli e Regina Elena, University of Milan, Via Francesco Sforza 35, Milan, Italy.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In particular, it has activity against several emerging pathogens, such as the Zygomycetes, which are resistant to many currently available antifungals, making it an attractive agent for use in both prophylactic and therapeutic situations. Studies demonstrating the prophylactic utility of posaconazole in neutropenic patients with acute myelogenous leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome, and in patients with graft-versus-host disease following allogeneic stem cell transplantation has led to the approval of the drug in the USA. These data have been reviewed elsewhere in detail. Published data on posaconazole as primary antifungal therapy are very limited, although there is a considerable amount of experience with the drug in the salvage setting following failure of or intolerance to other antifungal agents.

Chronic myeloid leukemia was the first malignancy to be linked to a clear genetic anomaly, the Philadelphia chromosome and, at present, it is probably the best understood of all human malignancies. Studies of the disease pathology revealed that the molecular consequence of the Philadelphia translocation is a BCR-ABL chimeric gene, which encodes a constitutively active tyrosine kinase with wholesale range of biological activities. Animal models have validated the direct role of the BCR-ABL protein in malignant transformation and subsequent research confirmed that its enhanced tyrosine kinase activity is essential and sufficient for the leukemogenesis. The very existence of a single genetic abnormality, presented in essentially all patients with the disease, made it an effective target for molecularly designed therapeutic approaches for the disease. The advent of tyrosine kinase inhibitors, designed specifically to inhibit the tyrosine kinase activity of the BCR-ABL oncoprotein, represents one of the major innovations in cancer therapy and may serve as a model for, how discoveries of disease pathogenesis may be translated into the development of successful targeted therapies in cancer medicine.","['Department of Hematology, Kuwait Cancer Control Center, Shuwaikh, Kuwait. annaadria@yahoo.com']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Clofarabine acts by inhibiting ribonucleotide reductase and DNA polymerase, thereby depleting the amount of intracellular deoxynucleoside triphosphates available for DNA replication. Compared with its precursors, clofarabine has an increased resistance to deamination and phosphorolysis, hence better stability, as well as higher affinity to deoxycytidine kinase (dCyd), the rate-limiting step in nucleoside phosphorylation. In 1993, the first Phase I study was initiated in patients with hematologic and solid malignancies. Since then, clofarabine has demonstrated single-agent antitumor activity in pediatric and adult acute leukemia. Owing to its unique properties of biochemical modulation when used in combination with other established antileukemic drugs, mainly cytarabine, combination regimens containing clofarabine are being evaluated. A review of the English literature was performed that included original articles and related reviews from the MEDLINE (PubMed) database and from abstracts based on the publication of meeting materials. This article describes the development, pharmacology and clinical activity of clofarabine, as well as its emerging role in the treatment of acute leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome and solid tumors.","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Blvd., Houston, TX 77030, USA. hadyghanem@hotmail.com']",['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Until recently, patients with myelodysplastic syndrome have been managed supportively with blood product transfusions and growth factors, until they succumb to infections, bleeding complications or transformation to acute leukemia. The discovery that epigenetic factors play an important role in cancer, and specifically in myelodysplastic syndrome, has led to the recent approval of several new therapies that will make a significant impact on this disease. Epigenetics refers to a number of biochemical modifications to chromatin that do not alter the primary DNA sequence, but play an important role in genomic regulation at the level of gene transcription. Epigenetic factors can be passed on from a cell to its progeny and can mimic traditional genetic lesions that are implicated in cancer. Unlike genetic abnormalities, however, epigenetic changes, such as DNA methylation or histone deacetylation, can be manipulated pharmacologically. Recently developed hypomethylating agents and histone deacetylase inhibitors have shown significant biological and clinical activity in myelodysplastic syndrome. These drugs have been well-tolerated by patients and have been shown to alter the course of this disease. In order to use these drugs optimally, however, we need to better understand the role of these epigenetic changes: how they contribute to the disease process, how we can use them to better select patients and how we can use combinations to target them more effectively.","['Department of Leukemia, University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Blvd., Houston, TX 77030, USA. tkadia@mdanderson.org']","['5P01 CA 108631/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA100632/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K12 CA088084/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K12 CA 088084/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA108631/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3833719,['NIHMS87787'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Activating mutations in the FLT3 receptor can be detected in approximately 30% of acute myeloid leukemias (AMLs) and are associated with a distinctly poor clinical outcome for patients. There are now several classes of FLT3 inhibitors in development with varying degrees of potency and selectivity for the target, including several in late-phase clinical trials in combination with chemotherapy. Major clinical responses in AML patients receiving single-agent FLT3 inhibitors have been rare, although transient peripheral blood blast reduction is common. Given such biological suggestion and preclinical activity, FLT3 inhibitors hold promise in improving the outcome of patients with mutant FLT3 AML.

CD33 and CD19 in combination are present on acute leukemiablasts with mixed lineage phenotype, but not on normal human hematopoietic cells. For comparison, two bispecific scFvs (bsscFvs), ds19-ds16 and 33-ds16, with monovalent binding to CD19 and CD33, respectively, were also studied. The sctb 33-ds16-ds19 specifically interacted with all 3 antigens. On the antigen double-positive cell line BV-173, the sctb bound with 2-fold greater avidity than bsscFv ds19-ds16 (KD = 21 vs. 42 nM) and with 1.4-fold greater avidity than bsscFv 33-ds16 (KD = 29 nM). All 3 fusion proteins had similar affinity for CD16 and sufficient thermic stability in human serum.

An improved understanding of susceptibility factors and the biological processes in which they act may lead to the development of t-AML prevention strategies. RESULTS: In this work we applied an integrated genomics strategy in inbred strains of mice to find novel factors that might contribute to susceptibility. We found that the pre-exposure transcriptional state of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells predicts susceptibility status. More than 900 genes were differentially expressed between susceptible and resistant strains and were highly enriched in the apoptotic program, but it remained unclear which genes, if any, contribute directly to t-AML susceptibility. To address this issue, we integrated gene expression data with genetic information, including single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and DNA copy number variants (CNVs), to identify genetic networks underlying t-AML susceptibility. The 30 t-AML susceptibility networks we found are robust: they were validated in independent, previously published expression data, and different analytical methods converge on them. Further, the networks are enriched in genes involved in cell cycle and DNA repair (pathways not discovered in traditional differential expression analysis), suggesting that these processes contribute to t-AML susceptibility. Within these networks, the putative regulators (e.g., Parp2, Casp9, Polr1b) are the most likely to have a non-redundant role in the pathogenesis of t-AML. While identifying these networks, we found that current CNVR and SNP-based haplotype maps in mice represented distinct sources of genetic variation contributing to expression variation, implying that mapping studies utilizing either source alone will have reduced sensitivity. CONCLUSION: The identification and prioritization of genes and networks not previously implicated in t-AML generates novel hypotheses on the biology and treatment of this disease that will be the focus of future research.","['Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Oncology, Stem Cell Biology Section, Washington University, St Louis, MO, USA.']",['T32 HG000045/HG/NHGRI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC3018144,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The expression levels of the above mentioned genes and their correlation with the BCL11B gene were analyzed in patients with T-ALL using the TaqMan and SYBR Green I real-time polymerase chain reaction technique. RESULTS: Expression levels of BCL11B, BCL2L1, and CREBBP mRNA in T-ALL patients were significantly higher than those from healthy controls (P<0.05). In T-ALL patients, the BCL11B expression level was negatively correlated with the BCL2L1 expression level (rs=-0.700; P<0.05), and positively correlated with the SPP1 expression level (rs=0.683; P<0.05). In healthy controls, the BCL11B expression level did not correlate with the TNFSF10, BCL2L1, SPP1, or CREBBP expression levels. CONCLUSIONS: Over-expression of BCL11B might play a role in anti-apoptosis in T-ALL cells through up-regulation of its downstream genes BCL2L1 and CREBBP.","['Institute of Hematology, Medical College, Jinan University, and Department of Hematology, Guangdong General Hospital, Guangzhou, 510632, PR China.']",,PMC2992472,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2010 Nov 16.,"Purple acid phosphatases (PAPs) are a group of metallohydrolases that contain a dinuclear Fe(III)M(II) center (M(II) = Fe, Mn, Zn) in the active site and are able to catalyze the hydrolysis of a variety of phosphoric acid esters. The dinuclear complex [(H(2)O)Fe(III)(mu-OH)Zn(II)(L-H)](ClO(4))(2) (2) with the ligand 2-[N-bis(2-pyridylmethyl)aminomethyl]-4-methyl-6-[N'-(2-pyridylmethyl)(2-hydroxyb enzyl) aminomethyl]phenol (H(2)L-H) has recently been prepared and is found to closely mimic the coordination environment of the Fe(III)Zn(II) active site found in red kidney bean PAP (Neves et al. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2007, 129, 7486). The biomimetic shows significant catalytic activity in hydrolytic reactions. By using a variety of structural, spectroscopic, and computational techniques the electronic structure of the Fe(III) center of this biomimetic complex was determined. In the solid state the electronic ground state reflects the rhombically distorted Fe(III)N(2)O(4) octahedron with a dominant tetragonal compression aligned along the mu-OH-Fe-O(phenolate) direction. To probe the role of the Fe-O(phenolate) bond, the phenolate moiety was modified to contain electron-donating or -withdrawing groups (-CH(3), -H, -Br, -NO(2)) in the 5-position. The effects of the substituents on the electronic properties of the biomimetic complexes were studied with a range of experimental and computational techniques. This study establishes benchmarks against accurate crystallographic structural information using spectroscopic techniques that are not restricted to single crystals. Kinetic studies on the hydrolysis reaction revealed that the phosphodiesterase activity increases in the order -NO(2) <--Br <--H <--CH(3) when 2,4-bis(dinitrophenyl)phosphate (2,4-bdnpp) was used as substrate, and a linear free energy relationship is found when log(k(cat)/k(0)) is plotted against the Hammett parameter sigma. However, nuclease activity measurements in the cleavage of double stranded DNA showed that the complexes containing the electron-withdrawing -NO(2) and electron-donating -CH(3) groups are the most active while the cytotoxic activity of the biomimetics on leukemia and lung tumoral cells is highest for complexes with electron-donating groups.","['Departamento de Quimica, Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina, Florianopolis, South Carolina 88040-900, Brazil.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this analysis was to investigate whether professional pest treatments in or around the home before birth or during childhood increased the risk of childhood ALL. Data from 388 cases and 870 frequency-matched controls were analyzed using unconditional logistic regression, adjusting for study matching variables and potential confounders, to calculate odds ratios (ORs). A meta-analysis of our findings with the published findings of previous studies was also conducted. The ORs for any professional pest control treatments were 1.19 (95% CI 0.83, 1.69) in the year before pregnancy, 1.30 (95% CI 0.86, 1.97) during pregnancy and 1.24 (95% CI 0.93, 1.65) for those done after the child's birth. The ORs for exposure after birth were highest when it occurred between the ages of two and three years. ORs were elevated for termite treatments before birth. ORs were higher for pre-B than T cell ALL and for t(12;21) (ETV6-Runx-1) than other cytogenetic sub-types. The pooled OR from a meta-analysis of our study with three previous studies of professional pest control treatments during pregnancy was 1.37 (95% CI 1.00, 1.88). Our results, and those of our meta-analysis, provide some evidence of a modestly increased risk of ALL for professional pest control treatments done during the index pregnancy and possibly in the child's early years.

The in vitro cytotoxicity of perifosine, bortezomib and lenalidomide against 6 cell lines derived from hematological malignancies was investigated using trypan blue staining, flow cytometry-based detection of activated caspases, Annexin V assays, immunohistochemistry studies (KI-67 and caspase-3 staining) and the immature-myeloid-information (IMI) technique. Perifosine and bortezomib induced concentration- and time-dependent cytotoxicity in all cell lines tested. Perifosine together with bortezomib largely exerted additive or synergistic effects with combination indices ranging from 1.13 to 0.22 for combined efficacies of 25% to 75% after 24-hour incubation. Lenalidomide-triggered cytotoxicity was low in all cell lines tested with any assay (less than 10% compared to the negative control). Finally, perifosine, but not bortezomib or lenalidomide, significantly increased the number of cells detected in the IMI channel. Perifosine and bortezomib- but not lenalidomide- trigger substantial cytotoxicity by caspase activation and mainly act additively or synergistically. The IMI technique might be a useful tool for studying cytotoxicity of agents like perifosine that interact mainly with the cellular membrane.","['Medizinische Klinik III, Hamatologie, Onkologie und Transfusionsmedizin, Charite Campus Benjamin Franklin, Hindenburgdamm 30, 12200 Berlin, Germany. martin.schmidt-hieber@charite.de']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Data sources included: incident total, leukemia, prostate, breast, colorectal, lung, kidney, and bladder cancers (1996-2005, SC Central Cancer Registry); demographic and groundwater use (1990 US Census); and groundwater uranium concentrations (n = 4,600, from existing federal and state databases). Kriging was used to predict average uranium concentrations within tracts. The relationship between uranium and standardized cancer incidence ratios was modeled among tracts with substantial groundwater use via linear or semiparametric regression, with and without stratification by the proportion of African Americans in each area. RESULTS: A total of 134,685 cancer cases were evaluated. Tracts with >/=50% groundwater use and uranium concentrations in the upper quartile had increased risks for colorectal, breast, kidney, prostate, and total cancer compared to referent tracts. Some of these relationships were more likely to be observed among tracts populated primarily by African Americans. CONCLUSION: SC regions with elevated groundwater uranium and more groundwater use may have an increased incidence of certain cancers, although additional research is needed since the design precluded adjustment for race or other predictive factors at the individual level.","['College of Public Health, Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Paul D.

Mitoxantrone therapy-related acute leukemia (TRAL) has recently become the focus of interest. METHODS: A case report of fatal TRAL following mitoxantrone therapy is presented with a discussion on the differential diagnosis and risk factors. The interdisciplinary development of diagnostic and therapeutic algorithms is presented from a haematological and neurological point of view. RESULTS: We describe the case of a 34-year-old MS patient who developed TRAL following mitoxantrone therapy (cumulative dose 45 mg/m(2) body surface). The patient died from endocarditis. TRAL is a rare but potentially fatal complication of mitoxantrone therapy with a wide variation of reported incidence. Thus far, no specific risk factors relating for example to preceding therapy and treatment regimens have been identified. Frequent laboratory controls and early bone marrow aspiration are mandatory for suspected TRAL as the condition is potentially curable. CONCLUSIONS: TRAL needs to be considered in the risk-benefit assessment of mitoxantrone therapy, however, the exact incidence and risk factors (e.g. dosage, treatment regimen) are still unclear. The risks are controllable under close surveillance and early diagnosis is important for prognosis. Future investigations need to concentrate on identification of potential risk factors.","['Neurologische Klinik, St.-Josef-Hospital, Klinikum der Ruhr-Universitat Bochum, Gudrunstrasse 56, 44791, Bochum.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,Mitoxantron-assoziierte akute Leukamie bei Multipler Sklerose.

Although the majority of HTLV-1-infected individuals remain asymptomatic carriers (AC) during their lifetime, 2-5% will develop either ATL or HAM/TSP, but never both. To better understand the gene expression changes in HTLV-1-associated diseases, we examined the mRNA profiles of CD4+ T cells isolated from 7 ATL, 12 HAM/TSP, 11 AC and 8 non-infected controls. Using genomic approaches followed by bioinformatic analysis, we identified gene expression pattern characteristic of HTLV-1 infected individuals and particular disease states. Of particular interest, the suppressor of cytokine signaling 1--SOCS1--was upregulated in HAM/TSP and AC patients but not in ATL. Moreover, SOCS1 was positively correlated with the expression of HTLV-1 mRNA in HAM/TSP patient samples. In primary PBMCs transfected with a HTLV-1 proviral clone and in HTLV-1-transformed MT-2 cells, HTLV-1 replication correlated with induction of SOCS1 and inhibition of IFN-alpha/beta and IFN-stimulated gene expression. Targeting SOCS1 with siRNA restored type I IFN production and reduced HTLV-1 replication in MT-2 cells. Conversely, exogenous expression of SOCS1 resulted in enhanced HTLV-1 mRNA synthesis. In addition to inhibiting signaling downstream of the IFN receptor, SOCS1 inhibited IFN-beta production by targeting IRF3 for ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. These observations identify a novel SOCS1 driven mechanism of evasion of the type I IFN antiviral response against HTLV-1.","['Molecular Oncology Group, Lady Davis Institute for Medical Research, Jewish General Hospital, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",['Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada'],PMC2973829,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its effect on oocyte maturation and how to exert the function remained to be elucidated. METHODS: Immature mice superovulated with human menopausal gonadotropin and germinal vesicle (GV) oocytes were obtained from ovary 48 hours after. GV oocytes were cultured in tissue culture medium 199 with 0, 100, 500 and 1,000 U/ml LIF. Cumulus expansion and in vitro maturation (IVM) rate were assessed after culture. For reverse transcriptase PCR, total RNA from GV and metaphase II (MII) oocytes were extracted by Trizol reagent. The quantity and quality of RNA were determined by spectrophotometry and electrophoresis, respectively. Reverse transcription was performed by Super Script III reverse transcriptase with 1 microg of total RNA followed by DNase I treatment and heat inactivation. Expression of gp130 was determined by RT-PCR. RESULTS: Our results showed that cumulus expansion was improved with 1,000 U/ml in culture medium compared to others. GV breakdown and MII rate in groups with LIF were higher than control group and were dose-dependent. In 1,000 U/ml, LIF rate of MII was significantly higher than control group (P less than 0.05).

Here we report, for the first time, expression of ROR1 gene in both tumor tissues and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from patients with renal cancer (RC). METHODS: In the current study, the expression of ROR1 gene was semi-quantitatively measured in PBMC and tumor tissues from 16 RC patients as well as PBMC from 22 healthy individuals relative to the expression of the housekeeping gene phosphoglucomutase 1 by RT-PCR. RESULTS: Our results showed that ROR1 was expressed at gene level in 81.3 percent of renal tumor tissues (13 out of 16) whereas it was expressed in 94 percent of PBMC from RC patients (15 out of 16). A weak expression of ROR1 was observed in PBMC of 4 out of 22 healthy individual. A significant expression of ROR1 was observed in PBMC from RC patients when compared to that in PBMC from normal healthy individuals (P less than 0.001). The expression of ROR1 in PBMC may reflect a shedding of tumor cells into blood stream. CONCLUSION: We conclude that detection of a high level of ROR1 expression in blood cells might assist in early detection of renal malignancies, providing taking into consideration the clinical symptoms of the disease.","['Dept. of Antigen and Antibody Engineering, Monoclonal Antibody Research Center, Avicenna Research Institute, ACECR, Tehran, Iran.', 'Dept. of Antigen and Antibody Engineering, Monoclonal Antibody Research Center, Avicenna Research Institute, ACECR, Tehran, Iran.', 'Immune and Gene Therapy Lab., CCK, Dept. of Oncology-Pathology, Karolinska University Hospital Solna, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Urology and Nephrology Research Center and Shahid Labbafinejad Hospital, Tehran, Iran.', 'Monoclonal Antibody Research Center, Avicenna Research Institute, ACECR, Tehran, Iran.', 'Dept. of Biology, Faculty of Sciences, Islamic Azad University, Science and Research Campus, Tehran, Iran.']",,PMC3904057,,,,,,,,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['ROR1', 'Ectopic expression', 'Renal cancer']",,,,,,,,,,

We show that knockdown of miR-126 results in increased c-Myb levels and promotes erythropoiesis at the expense of thrombopoiesis in vivo. We further provide evidence that specification of thrombocyte versus erythrocyte cell lineages is altered by the concerted activities of the microRNAs (miRNAs) miR-126 and miR-150. Both miRNAs are required but not sufficient individually to precisely regulate the cell fate decision between erythroid and megakaryocytic lineages during definitive hematopoiesis in vivo.

However, the complexity of these diseases in terms of both clonal structure and mutation repertoire makes it unlikely that JAK inhibitor therapy will replicate what has been achieved with imatinib in chronic myeloid leukemia. Consistent with this view, JAK inhibitor therapy in myelofibrosis has not yet produced complete or partial remissions. However, most patients treated with a JAK2 (TG101348) or JAK1/2 (INCB018424) inhibitor experienced substantial improvement in constitutional symptoms and reduction in spleen size; the mechanism of action for INCB018424 includes anti-JAK1-mediated downregulation of proinflammatory cytokines. These observations complicate the choice of primary end points in clinical trials that would be robust enough to support regulatory approval. TG101348 and INCB018424 are the vanguard of JAK inhibitor therapy in myelofibrosis, but newer JAK inhibitors might have a broader spectrum of activity; preliminary results with CYT387 suggest responses in both anemia and splenomegaly. Outstanding issues regarding these drugs include identification of the optimal dosing strategy, their role (if any) in the treatment of polycythemia vera or essential thrombocythemia, and the potential for combining them with other therapeutic agents.","['Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905, USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The number of HSPCs in the circulation can be markedly increased in response to a number of stimuli, including hematopoietic growth factors, myeloablative agents and environmental stresses such as infection. The ability to 'mobilize' HSPCs from the bone marrow to the blood has been exploited clinically to obtain HSPCs for stem cell transplantation and, more recently, to stimulate therapeutic angiogenesis at sites of tissue ischemia. Moreover, there is recent interest in the use of mobilizing agents to sensitize leukemia and other hematopoietic malignancies to cytotoxic agents. Key to optimizing clinical mobilizing regimens is an understanding of the fundamental mechanisms of HSPC mobilization. In this review, we discuss recent advances in our understanding of the mechanisms by which granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), the prototypical mobilizing agent, induces HSPC mobilization.","['Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, MO 63110, USA.']",['R01 HL060772/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Compared with wild-type IDH2, mutation of IDH2 was associated with higher platelet counts, intermediate-risk or normal karyotype and isolated +8, but was inversely correlated with expression of HLA-DR, CD34, CD15, CD7 and CD56, and was mutually exclusive with WT1 mutation and chromosomal translocations involving core-binding factors. All these correlations became stronger when IDH1 and IDH2 mutations were considered together. Multivariate analysis revealed IDH2 mutation as an independent favorable prognostic factor. IDH2(-)/FLT3-ITD(+) genotype conferred especially negative impact on survival. Compared with IDH2 R140 mutation, IDH2 R172 mutation was associated with younger age, lower white blood cell count and lactate dehydrogenase level, and was mutually exclusive with NPM1 mutation. Serial analyses of IDH2 mutations at both diagnosis and relapse in 121 patients confirmed high stability of IDH2 mutations.

In this study, we investigated the underlying molecular mechanisms governing this effect. Although significant differences in the expression or turnover of CXCR4 were not observed between ZAP-70(+) and ZAP-70(-) cell samples, CXCL12 induced greater intracellular Ca(2+) flux and stronger and more prolonged phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase (MEK) in the ZAP-70(+) CLL cells. The CXCL12-induced phosphorylation of ERK and MEK in ZAP-70(+) CLL cells was blocked by sorafenib, a small molecule inhibitor of RAF. Furthermore, ZAP-70(+) CLL cells were more sensitive than ZAP-70(-) CLL cells to the cytotoxic effects of sorafenib in vitro at concentrations that can readily be achieved in vivo. The data suggest that ZAP-70(+) CLL cells may be more responsive to survival factors, like CXCL12, that are elaborated by the leukemia microenvironment, and this sensitivity could be exploited for the development of new treatments for patients with this disease.

Epub 2010 Nov 15.,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the prognostic significance of expression levels of a single microRNA, miR-181a, in the context of established molecular markers in cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia (CN-AML), and to gain insight into the leukemogenic role of miR-181a. PATIENTS AND METHODS: miR-181a expression was measured in pretreatment marrow using Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center version 3.0 arrays in 187 younger (<60 years) adults with CN-AML. Presence of other molecular prognosticators was assessed centrally. A gene-expression profile associated with miR-181a expression was derived using microarrays and evaluated by Gene-Ontology analysis. RESULTS: Higher miR-181a expression associated with a higher complete remission (CR) rate (P=.04), longer overall survival (OS; P=.01) and a trend for longer disease-free survival (DFS; P=.09). The impact of miR-181a was most striking in poor molecular risk patients with FLT3-internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD) and/or NPM1 wild-type, where higher miR-181a expression associated with a higher CR rate (P=.009), and longer DFS (P<.001) and OS (P<.001). In multivariable analyses, higher miR-181a expression was significantly associated with better outcome, both in the whole patient cohort and in patients with FLT3-ITD and/or NPM1 wild-type. These results were also validated in an independent set of older (>/=60 years) patients with CN-AML. A miR-181a-associated gene-expression profile was characterized by enrichment of genes usually involved in innate immunity. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, we provide the first evidence that the expression of a single microRNA, miR-181a, is associated with clinical outcome of patients with CN-AML and may refine their molecular risk classification. Targeted treatments that increase endogenous levels of miR-181a might represent novel therapeutic strategies.","['The Ohio State University, Comprehensive Cancer Center, Biomedical Research Tower, 460 W 12th Ave, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.']","['U10 CA033601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24 CA114725/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA101140/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA77658/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA31946/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA140158/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA33601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA140158/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA16058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA101140/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA077658/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA031946/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA129657/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA129657/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA114725/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3018359,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Skin biopsy specimens were obtained from the foot arch and analyzed by light microscopy, immunofluorescence microscopy, and electron microscopy. SETTING: Oslo University Hospital-Gaustad, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-one patients had primary EM, 17 patients had secondary EM, and 1 patient had erythromelalgic syndrome. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Evidence of microvascular abnormalities in skin biopsy specimens. RESULTS: Light microscopy showed evidence of capillary proliferation in 10 of 31 patients with primary EM and in 1 of 17 patients with secondary EM. The biopsy specimen from the patient with erythromelalgic syndrome showed numerous capillary nests with endothelial cell defects and a slight perivascular inflammatory reaction. Among the 17 secondary EM cases, sparse perivascular lymphocyte infiltrations were observed in the biopsy specimens from 2 patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia and 1 patient with diabetes mellitus. Eleven patients also had signs of vasculopathy based on findings of immunodeposits of C3 and fibrin. Six of 30 patients with primary EM showed endothelial abnormalities on electron microscopy. All 3 investigations showed unremarkable biopsy results in 16 cases. CONCLUSIONS: Histopathologic analysis is not useful as a routine diagnostic tool in EM because no morphological changes are specific to EM. The capillary proliferation and vasculopathy are assumed to be a consequence of intermittent skin hypoxia (vascular hypothesis of pathogenesis). Whether the proliferation is a consequence of EM or a pathogenic factor in the development of the disease is uncertain.","['Department of Dermatology, Oslo University Hospital-Gaustad, Norway. o-kalga@online.no']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we demonstrate that miR-21 targets and down-regulates the core mismatch repair (MMR) recognition protein complex, human mutS homolog 2 (hMSH2) and 6 (hMSH6). Colorectal tumors that express a high level of miR-21 display reduced hMSH2 protein expression. Cells that overproduce miR-21 exhibit significantly reduced 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-induced G2/M damage arrest and apoptosis that is characteristic of defects in the core MMR component. Moreover, xenograft studies demonstrate that miR-21 overexpression dramatically reduces the therapeutic efficacy of 5-FU. These studies suggest that the down-regulation of the MMR mutator gene associated with miR-21 overexpression may be an important clinical indicator of therapeutic efficacy in colorectal cancer.","['Departments of Molecular Virology, Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.']","['U01 CA152758/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM080176/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'CA152758/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM080176/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'CA067007/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK069370/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA067007/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3000294,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2010 Nov 15.,"TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) shows promise as a cancer treatment, but acquired tumor resistance to TRAIL is a roadblock. Here we investigated whether nimbolide, a limonoid, could sensitize human colon cancer cells to TRAIL. As indicated by assays that measure esterase activity, sub-G(1) fractions, mitochondrial activity, and activation of caspases, nimbolide potentiated the effect of TRAIL. This limonoid also enhanced expression of death receptors (DRs) DR5 and DR4 in cancer cells. Gene silencing of the receptors reduced the effect of limonoid on TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Using pharmacological inhibitors, we found that activation of ERK and p38 MAPK was required for DR up-regulation by nimbolide. Gene silencing of ERK abolished the enhancement of TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Moreover, our studies indicate that the limonoid induced reactive oxygen species production, which was required for ERK activation, up-regulation of DRs, and sensitization to TRAIL; these effects were mimicked by H(2)O(2). In addition, nimbolide down-regulated cell survival proteins, including I-FLICE, cIAP-1, cIAP-2, Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, survivin, and X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein, and up-regulated the pro-apoptotic proteins p53 and Bax. Interestingly, p53 and Bax up-regulation by nimbolide was required for sensitization to TRAIL but not for DR up-regulation. Overall, our results indicate that nimbolide can sensitize colon cancer cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis through three distinct mechanisms: reactive oxygen species- and ERK-mediated up-regulation of DR5 and DR4, down-regulation of cell survival proteins, and up-regulation of p53 and Bax.","['Cytokine Research Laboratory, Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.']","['P01 CA124787/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-124787-01A2/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3020720,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"['Gupta SC, Reuter S, Phromnoi K, Park B, Hema PS, Nair M, Aggarwal BB.

Epub 2010 Nov 24.,"Imatinib is the standard of care for patients with advanced metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST), and is also approved for adjuvant treatment in patients at substantial risk of relapse. Studies have shown that maximizing benefit from imatinib depends on long-term administration at recommended doses. Pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic factors, adherence, and drug-drug interactions can affect exposure to imatinib and impact clinical outcomes. This article reviews the relevance of these factors to imatinib's clinical activity and response in the context of what has been demonstrated in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), and in light of new data correlating imatinib exposure to response in patients with GIST. Because of the wide inter-patient variability in drug exposure with imatinib in both CML and GIST, blood level testing (BLT) may play a role in investigating instances of suboptimal response, unusually severe toxicities, drug-drug interactions, and suspected non-adherence. Published clinical data in CML and in GIST were considered, including data from a PK substudy of the B2222 trial correlating imatinib blood levels with clinical responses in patients with GIST. Imatinib trough plasma levels < 1100 ng/mL were associated with lower rates of objective response and faster development of progressive disease in patients with GIST. These findings have been supported by other analyses correlating free imatinib (unbound) levels with response. These results suggest a future application for imatinib BLT in predicting and optimizing therapeutic response. Nevertheless, early estimates of threshold imatinib blood levels must be confirmed prospectively in future studies and elaborated for different patient subgroups.","['Department of Medical Oncology, Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA 19111, USA.

Epub 2010 Nov 27.,"Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is one of the most common haematological malignancies and is increasing in frequency due to an ageing population. Whilst remission will be achieved in up to 80% of those receiving intensive chemotherapy, the main variables precluding cure are the treatment-related mortality and relapse rates. Decisions on intensification, de-escalation and allografting rely on the ability to divide an apparently homogeneous group according to risk. A wide range of clinical, cytogenetic and molecular variables may be used to inform this task. Cytogenetic and molecular characterisation has already identified subgroups, such as acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) with t(15;17)/PML-RARA and AML with FLT3 mutation for which targeted therapies are available, and further molecularly defined groups who may be potential candidates for this approach are likely to be identified in the future. This review examines the range of established clinical and diagnostic parameters that should be used in assessing prognosis for a patient with AML and looks ahead to an expanding repertoire of potential variables that are currently under evaluation.","[""Department of Haematology, St. Bartholomew's Hospital, London, UK.""]",,,,,['Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), gelatin zymography assay and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were used to test the secretions, activities and mRNA expressions of MMP-1, MMP-2 and MMP-9. In the study of the regulatory mechanism of AKBA and ATO on MMPs, AKBA and ATO were cocultured with the cell models. ELISA was used to test the secretions of TNF-alpha and interleukin-1beta (IL-beta) and Western blot was used to test the phosphorylation levels of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) and p38 mitogen-activated proteinkinase (p38MAPK). RESULTS: Compound of AKBA and ATO inhibited MMP-1, MMP-2 and MMP-9 mRNA expressions, secretions and activities respectively in HSFbs and THP-1 cells in inflammatory state (P<0.05, P<0.01). Also compound of AKBA and ATO inhibited secretions of TNF-alpha and IL-1beta in THP-1 cells and cell coculture system (P<0.01). It also decreased the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK in HSFbs and THP-1 cells (P<0.05, P<0.01). CONCLUSION: The combined use of AKBA and ATO which in line with the rule of activating blood and resolving putridity inhibits fibroblasts and inflammatory cells in producing MMPs in inflammatory state through inhibiting the release of inflammatory factors and MAPK cascade pathway.","['Beijing Institute of Chinese Medicine, Beijing Hospital of Chinese Medicine, Capital Medical University, Beijing 100010, China.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The G/G genotype of the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs1617640 in the erythropoietin (EPO) promoter has been shown to be associated with decreased EPO expression. We examined the association of rs1617640 genotype with MDS. METHODS: We genotyped the EPO rS1617640 SNP in 189 patients with MDS, 257 with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), 106 with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, 97 with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, 353 with chronic myeloid leukemia, and 95 healthy controls. RESULTS: The G/G genotype was significantly more common in MDS patients (47/187; 25.1%) than in controls (6/95; 6.3%) or in patients with other leukemias (101/813; 12.4%) (all P < 0.001). Individuals with the G/G genotype were more likely than those with other genotypes to have MDS (odd ratio = 4.98; 95% CI = 2.04-12.13). Clinical and follow up data were available for 112 MDS patients and 186 AML patients. There was no correlation between EPO promoter genotype and response to therapy or overall survival in MDS or AML. In the MDS group, the GG genotype was significantly associated with shorter complete remission duration, as compared with the TT genotype (P = 0.03). Time to neutrophils recovery after therapy was significantly longer in MDS patients with the G/G genotype (P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest a strong association between the rs1617640 G/G genotype and MDS. Further studies are warranted to investigate the utility of screening for this marker in individuals exposed to environmental toxins or chemotherapy.","['Department of Hematology/Oncology, Quest Diagnostics Nichols Institute, San Juan Capistrano, CA, USA.']",,PMC2992491,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: We performed an exploratory study on 30 cases of MDS, myeloproliferative neoplasia (MPN) or evolving acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (% bone marrow blasts </= 30%, range 0-30%, median, 8%) by aCGH, using a genome-wide bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) microarray. The sample data were compared to corresponding cytogenetics, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and clinical-pathological findings. Previously unidentified imbalances, in particular those considered submicroscopic aberrations (< 10 Mb), were confirmed by FISH analysis. CNAs identified by aCGH were concordant with the cytogenetic/FISH results in 25/30 (83%) of the samples tested. aCGH revealed new CNAs in 14/30 (47%) patients, including 28 submicroscopic or hidden aberrations verified by FISH studies. Cryptic 344-kb RUNX1 deletions were found in three patients at time of AML transformation. Other hidden CNAs involved 3q26.2/EVI1, 5q22/APC, 5q32/TCERG1,12p13.1/EMP1, 12q21.3/KITLG, and 17q11.2/NF1. Gains of CCND2/12p13.32 were detected in two patients. aCGH failed to detect a balanced translocation (n = 1) and low-level clonality (n = 4) in five karyotypically aberrant samples, revealing clinically important assay limitations. CONCLUSIONS: The detection of previously known and unknown genomic alterations suggests that aCGH has considerable promise for identification of both recurring microscopic and submicroscopic genomic imbalances that contribute to myeloid disease pathogenesis and progression. These findings suggest that development of higher-resolution microarray platforms could improve karyotyping in clinical practice.","['Signature Genomics, Spokane, WA, USA. shaffer@signaturegenomics.com.']",,PMC3000833,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2010 Nov 15.,"Prognostic impact of peripheral blood white blood cell count (WBC) at the diagnosis of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) was evaluated in a population-based consecutive series of 2666 children aged 1-15 treated for ALL between 1992 and 2008 in the five Nordic countries (Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden). Ten-year event-free (pEFS(10 y)) survival and overall (pOS(10 y)) survival were 0.75 +/- 0.01 and 0.85 +/- 0.01, respectively. Although treatment intensity was determined by WBC, non-remission and relapsed patients still had significantly higher WBC than those in remission for B-cell precursor (BCP) (median WBC: 24.8 vs. 14.0 vs. 8.3 x 10(9) /L, P < 0.001), but not for T-lineage (T-ALL) (median WBC: 127.8 vs. 113.0 vs. 86.8 x 10(9) /L, P = 0.22). pEFS was inversely related to WBC for BCP (P < 0.001), but not for T-ALL. WBC was not associated with risk of event for BCP or T-ALL for patients with minimal residual disease at the end of induction (MRD(d29) ) <10(-3). In contrast, for MRD(d29) >/= 10(-3) and <5% leukaemic blasts in bone marrow at day 29, the pEFS(5 y) for WBC < 100.0 (N = 152) vs. >/= 100.0 (N = 19) was 0.76 vs. 0.50 (P = 0.001). That was the case both for BCP (pEFS(5 y) 0.76 vs. 0.58) and for T-ALL (pEFS(5 y) 0.71 vs. 0.38). Whether the inferior EFS for the subset of patients with high WBC and slow initial response to treatment reflects rare or overlooked cytogenetic aberrations as well as the factors that determine WBC levels at diagnosis awaits exploration.","['Centre for Paediatric Oncology and Haematology, University Childrens Hospital, Vilnius, Lithuania.']",,,,,['(c) 2010 John Wiley & Sons A/S.'],,,,['Nordic Society of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology (NOPHO)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2010 Nov 15.,"Constitutive activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling has been observed in up to 70% of acute myeloid leukemia. Class I(A) PI3K consists of a catalytic subunit (p110alpha, p110beta, p110delta) and an adapter subunit (p85alpha, p55alpha, p50alpha, p85beta, p55gamma). The p85alpha adapter subunit stabilizes the catalytic p110 subunit and recruits p110 to the plasma membrane. In addition, p85alpha inhibits the basal activity of p110alpha and can negatively regulate signal transduction, as shown for insulin and GM-CSF receptor signaling. Here, we describe that the expression of p85alpha is posttranscriptionally regulated in several human and murine leukemia cell lines and in a Hodgkin lymphoma cell line (CO) by translational repression. A detailed analysis of CO cells revealed that both wild type and a mutated p85alpha mRNA are detectable at similar ratios in the nucleus and polysomes. However, while the mutated p85alpha protein is expressed in CO cells, translation of the wild type p85alpha mRNA is completely inhibited.

Epub 2010 Nov 15.,"Epigenetic changes play a role in the pathogenesis of myeloid malignancies, and hypomethylating agents have shown efficacy in these diseases. We studied the apoptotic effect, genome-wide methylation, and gene expression profiles in HL60 cells following 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (decitabine; DAC) treatment, using microarray technologies. Decitabine treatment resulted in a decrease in global DNA methylation, corresponding to 4876 probeset IDs with significantly reduced methylation levels, while the expression of 2583 IDs was modified. The integrated analysis identified 160 genes demethylated and up-regulated by decitabine, mainly including development and differentiation pathway genes. Gene targets of Polycomb group protein regulation were overrepresented in this group. Apoptosis was induced by decitabine, and apoptosis-specific PCR arrays more precisely indicated decitabine-induced up-regulation of 13 apoptosis-related genes, in particular DAP-kinase 1 and BCL2L10. Correspondingly, in primary patient samples, BCL2L10 was hypermethylated in 45% of AML, 43% of therapy-related myeloid neoplasms, 12% of MDS, and in none of the controls. In conclusion, decitabine induces global demethylation and gene expression, in particular of Polycomb target genes involved in development and differentiation pathways. The apoptotic gene BCL2L10 is a frequent target for aberrant promoter methylation in patients with acute leukemia, de novo and therapy-related.","[""Istituto di Ematologia, Universita' Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Rome, Italy.""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: With the use of serial paraffin or vibratome sections of more than 20 mum thickness infiltrated with eosin fluorescence dye the images of arterial and venous walls of different calibres, capillaries, and venous sinuses were morphologically revealed. RESULTS: Venous sinuses were frequently found to create mutually communicating branches and their lining projected into the lumen protruding cells with distinct spherically or ovally shaped nuclei, positioned on the brightly fluorescent and fragmented lamina basalis. The presence of lymphocytes was distinct in periarteriolar lymphoid sheath (PALS) and lymphatic follicles. Lining cells of the red pulp veins sporadically contained marked eosinophilic granules. CONCLUSION: The method of LSCM allowed: 1. to reveal two-dimensional and sharp image of the human spleen structures, 2. to investigate the vertical course of venous structures in the tissue, 3. to obtain serial optic sections in z axis to their maximum spatial projections. These data will also serve for the creation of three-dimensional images of vessel network in the human spleen in the future studies.","['Department of Histology and Embryology, Faculty of Medicine, Comenius University, Brutislava, Slovakia. paulina.galfiova@fmed.uniba.sk']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2010 Nov 15.,"A number of clever recombinant methodologies have been developed that recapitulate the valencies of IgG's (bivalent) and IgA's (tetravalent). Although higher synthetic valencies have been achieved by conjugation of either monoclonal antibodies or single-chain antibodies to nanoparticles and liposomes, a method for the preparation of recombinant antibodies with valencies similar to IgM's (decavalent) but considerably less than what is generally found after antibody particle conjugation has yet to be devised. Recently, we have developed a methodology for the design of bivalent Chemically Self-Assembled Antibody Nanorings (CSANs). We now report the crystal structure of the nanoring subunit composed of the E. coli DHFR dimer and a methotrexate dimerizer (MTX2-C9) containing a visible nine methylene linker and a protocol for the preparation of CSANs from this subunit with valencies similar to IgM's, ranging from 8-10 single chain antibodies (scFvs). The multivalent CSANs were reversibly assembled from a fusion protein dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR)-DHFR-antiCD3 scFv containing a single glycine linker between the two DHFR scaffolding proteins. We also demonstrate that, similar to the parental bivalent anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody (mAB), anti-CD3 CSANs selectively bind to CD3+ leukemia cells and undergo rapid internalization through a caveolin-independent pathway that requires cholesterol, actin polymerization, and protein tyrosine kinase activation. While treatment with the monoclonal antibody leads to T-cell activation and nearly complete loss (i.e., 90%) of the surface displayed T-cell receptor (TCR), only 25-30% of the TCR down regulate and no significant T-cell proliferation is observed after treatment of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with anti-CD3 CSANs. Consistent with the proliferation findings, 15-25% less CD25 (IL-2 receptor) was found on the surface of PBMCs treated with either the polyvalent or bivalent anti-CD3 CSANs, respectively, than on PBMCs treated with the parental mAB. Comparative experiments with F(ab')2 derived from the mAB confirm that the activation of the T-cells by the mAB is dependent on the Fc domain, and thus interactions of the PBMC T-cells with accessory cells, such as macrophages. Taken together, our results demonstrate that anti-CD3 CSANs with valencies ranging from 2 to 8 could be employed for radionuclide, drug, or potentially oligonucleotide delivery to T-cells without, as has been observed for other antibody conjugated nanoparticles, the deleterious effects of activation observed for mAB. Further the CSAN construct may be adapted for the preparation of other multivalent scFvs.","['Department of Chemistry, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455, USA.']","['R01 CA125360/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32CA138312/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA125360/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA125360-01A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA120116/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA120116-01A2/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA138312/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA120116/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3342400,['NIHMS252501'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2011 Feb 26.,"Target-specific acute myeloid leukemia (AML) immunotherapy requires selective cell-surface antigens on AML blast cells. CD64 is a promising candidate antigen because it is abundantly expressed on monocytoid differentiated AML subtypes. In previous studies, a chemically linked full-length anti-CD64 immunotoxin based on ricin A showed promising results in several animal models, but further development has been hindered by its substantial, dose-limiting off-target effects. We recently constructed the recombinant immunotoxin H22(scFv)-ETA', comprising a truncated Pseudomonas exotoxin A (PE) and a humanized scFv antibody against CD64. This molecule was shown to kill CD64(+) AML-derived tumor cell lines and primary patient-derived AML cells specifically, both in vitro and ex vivo. Here we describe the in vivo efficiency of H22(scFv)-ETA' in the U937/SCID mouse xenograft model for human AML, by providing immunohistochemical evidence for the elimination of human CD64(+) tumor cells in mouse organs. H22(scFv)-ETA' showed potent antitumor activity against myeloid tumor cells and significantly prolonged the overall survival of AML xenograft animals. In conclusion, H22(scFv)-ETA' is efficacious against AML with monocytoid differentiation in vitro and in animal models in vivo, providing the basis for a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of AML patients.","['Department of Experimental Medicine and Immunotherapy, Institute of Applied Medical Engineering, Helmholtz-Institute for Biomedical Engineering, University Hospital RWTH Aachen, Aachen, Germany. tur@hia.rwth-aachen.de']",,,,,['Copyright (c) 2010 UICC.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The leukemogenesis model for CBFL posits that one, or more, gene mutations inducing increased cell proliferation and/or inhibition of apoptosis cooperate with CBF mutations for leukemia development. One of the most common mutations associated with CBF mutations involves the KIT receptor. A high expression of KIT is a hallmark of a high proportion of CBFL. Previous studies indicate that microRNA (MIR) 222/221 targets the 3' untranslated region of the KIT messenger RNA and our observation that AML1 can bind the MIR-222/221 promoter, we hypothesized that MIR-222/221 represents the link between CBF and KIT. Here, we show that MIR-222/221 expression is upregulated after myeloid differentiation of normal bone marrow AC133(+) stem progenitor cells. CBFL blasts with either t(8;21) or inv(16) CBF rearrangements with high expression levels of KIT (CD117) display a significantly lower level of MIR-222/221 expression than non-CBFL blasts. Consistently, we found that the t(8;21) AML1-MTG8 fusion protein binds the MIR-222/221 promoter and induces transcriptional repression of a MIR-222/221-LUC reporter. Because of the highly conserved sequence homology, we demonstrated concomitant MIR-222/221 down-regulation and KIT up-regulation in the 32D/WT1 mouse cell model carrying the AML1-MTG16 fusion protein. This study provides the first hint that CBFL-associated fusion proteins may lead to up-regulation of the KIT receptor by down-regulating MIR-222/221, thus explaining the concomitant occurrence of CBF genetic rearrangements and overexpression of wild type or mutant KIT in AML.","['Dipartimento di Biologia e Genetica per le Scienze Mediche, Facolta di Medicina, Universita degli Studi di Milano, Milan, Italy.']",,PMC2978910,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2010 Nov 15.,"Accumulating evidence indicates that many human cancers are organized as a cellular hierarchy initiated and maintained by self-renewing cancer stem cells. This cancer stem cell model has been most conclusively established for human acute myeloid leukemia (AML), although controversies still exist regarding the identity of human AML stem cells (leukemia stem cell (LSC)). A major implication of this model is that, in order to eradicate the cancer and cure the patient, the cancer stem cells must be eliminated. Monoclonal antibodies have emerged as effective targeted therapies for the treatment of a number of human malignancies and, given their target antigen specificity and generally minimal toxicity, are well positioned as cancer stem cell-targeting therapies. One strategy for the development of monoclonal antibodies targeting human AML stem cells involves first identifying cell surface antigens preferentially expressed on AML LSC compared with normal hematopoietic stem cells. In recent years, a number of such antigens have been identified, including CD123, CD44, CLL-1, CD96, CD47, CD32, and CD25. Moreover, monoclonal antibodies targeting CD44, CD123, and CD47 have demonstrated efficacy against AML LSC in xenotransplantation models. Hopefully, these antibodies will ultimately prove to be effective in the treatment of human AML.","['Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Cancer Center, and Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Palo Alto, CA 94305, USA. rmajeti@stanford.edu']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, B1 displayed stronger antitumor effects than amonafide in HL60 cells. We further examined whether B1 overcomes the resistance conferred by Bcl-2, as overcoming the resistance conferred by Bcl-2 represents an attractive therapeutic strategy against cancer. Our viability assay showed that B1 overcomes the resistance conferred by Bcl-2 in human promyelocytic leukemia HL60 cells. Various apoptosis assessment assays showed that B1 overcomes the resistance conferred by Bcl-2 in HL60 cells by inducing apoptosis. Noticeably, we elucidated the marked downregulation of 14-3-3sigma protein by B1, indicating that B1 overcomes the resistance conferred by Bcl-2 in HL60 cells via 14-3-3sigma. The analysis of chromatin immunoprecipitation assay indicated that MBD2 was associated with the methylated 14-3-3sigma promoter-associated CpG island and thus interfered with transcriptional activity of the methylated promoter. Furthermore, knockdown of MBD2, using siRNA transfection, inhibited B1-induced apoptosis and overcame the resistance conferred by Bcl-2. Accordingly, these data showed the involvement of MBD2 in B1-induced apoptosis and overcoming the resistance conferred by Bcl-2, which suggested that MBD2 might guide the development of future anticancer agents.","['State Key Laboratory of Bioreactor Engineering & Shanghai Key Laboratory of Chemical Biology, School of Pharmacy, East China University of Science and Technology, 268, 130 Meilong Road, Shanghai 200237, PR China.']",,,,,['(c)2010 AACR.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Through its LIM domains, LMO2 is thought to function as the scaffold for a DNA-binding transcription regulator complex, including the basic helix-loop-helix proteins SCL/TAL1 and E47, the zinc finger protein GATA-1, and LIM-domain interacting protein LDB1. To understand the role of LMO2 in the formation of this complex and ultimately to dissect its function in normal and aberrant hematopoiesis, we solved the crystal structure of LMO2 in complex with the LID domain of LDB1 at 2.4 A resolution. We observe a largely unstructured LMO2 kept in register by the LID binding both LIM domains. Comparison of independently determined crystal structures of LMO2 reveals large movements around a conserved hinge between the LIM domains. We demonstrate that such conformational flexibility is necessary for binding of LMO2 to its partner protein SCL/TAL1 in vitro and for the function of this complex in vivo. These results, together with molecular docking and analysis of evolutionarily conserved residues, yield the first structural model of the DNA-binding complex containing LMO2, LDB1, SCL/TAL1, and GATA-1.","['Division of Structural Biology, Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HTLV-1 is transmitted to T cells through the virological synapse and by extracellular viral assemblies. Here, we uncovered an additional mechanism of virus transmission that is regulated by the HTLV-1-encoded p8 protein. We found that the p8 protein, known to anergize T cells, is also able to increase T-cell contact through lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 clustering. In addition, p8 augments the number and length of cellular conduits among T cells and is transferred to neighboring T cells through these conduits. p8, by establishing a T-cell network, enhances the envelope-dependent transmission of HTLV-1. Thus, the ability of p8 to simultaneously anergize and cluster T cells, together with its induction of cellular conduits, secures virus propagation while avoiding the host's immune surveillance. This work identifies p8 as a viral target for the development of therapeutic strategies that may limit the expansion of infected cells in HTLV-1 carriers and decrease HTLV-1-associated morbidity.","['Animal Models Retroviral Vaccine Section, Vaccine Branch, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']","['HHSN261200800001C/RC/CCR NIH HHS/United States', 'HHSN261200800001E/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HHMI/Howard Hughes Medical Institute/United States', 'ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2996430,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tumour suppressor protein p53 integrates intracellular data in stress responses, receiving signals and translating these into differential gene expression. Interpretation of the data integrated on p53 may therefore reveal the response to therapy in cancer. Proteomics offers more specific data - closer to ""the real action"" - than the hitherto more frequently used gene expression profiling. Integrated data analysis may reveal pathways disrupted at several regulatory levels. Ultimately, integrated data analysis may also contribute to finding key underlying cancer genes. We here proposes a Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR)-based data integration strategy, which allows simultaneous analysis of proteomic data, gene expression data and classical clinical parameters. PLSR collapses multidimensional data into fewer relevant dimensions for data interpretation. PLSR can also aid identification of functionally important modules by also performing comparison to databases on known biological interactions. Further, PLSR allows meaningful visualization of complex datasets, aiding interpretation of the underlying biology. Extracting the true biological causal mechanisms from heterogeneous patient populations is the key to discovery of new therapeutic options in cancer.","['Institute of Medicine, Haukeland Hospital, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway.']",,,,,['Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

This study examined the effect of NCTD on tumor cells by using a model of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate plus ionomycin (PMAI)-activated leukemia Jurkat T cells. The results showed that NCTD significantly inhibited the viability of cells with and without PMAI treatment. NCTD induced cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase, down-regulated the expression of calcineurin and, by itself or in combination with Cyclosporine A, reduced calcineurin phosphatase activity.

Regarding major cytokine and chemokine secretion profile, NCTD attenuates PMAI-augmented production of IL-2, but slightly increases or has no effect on TNF-alpha and IL-8. By blockade of various MAPK, NCTD regulates PMAI-augmented IL-2 production through activation of P38 and ERK1/2, in accordance with the aforementioned MAPK expression. In conclusion, NCTD inhibited IL-2 production in PMAI-activated human leukemia Jurkat T cells through activation of P38 and ERK1/2, suggesting that NCTD might have the potential of being used as a chemopreventive agent to inhibit tumor progression in the future.","['Department of Research and Education, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.']",,,,,['Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Epub 2010 Nov 12.,"4-Methylimidazole (4-MEI) is found in a wide array of food products. The National Toxicology Program (NTP) recently conducted a two-year feeding cancer bioassay of 4-MEI in B6C3F(1) mice and F344/N rats. In rats, NTP found ""equivocal evidence of carcinogenic activity"" in females based on increased incidences of mononuclear cell leukemia and ""no evidence of carcinogenic activity"" in males. However, dose-related, statistically significant decreases in multiple tumors were observed in both male and female rats exposed to 4-MEI in the NTP bioassay. For example, 4-MEI was associated with a 25-fold decrease in the incidence of mammary tumors among high dose females. NTP noted briefly that the decreases in certain tumors, including mammary tumors, were greater than could be attributed to body weight alone. The present paper provides a more detailed evaluation of the evidence that 4-MEI exhibits tumor preventive activity in the rat based upon the results of the NTP bioassay. Reduced body weight offers a partial explanation for the reduction in tumors, but does not appear to be the primary cause of the decreased tumor incidences, indicating that 4-MEI itself may possess an ability to prevent tumor formation.","['Murray and Associates, San Jose, CA 95138, USA. jmurray2@sbcglobal.net']",,,,,['Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Epub 2010 Nov 12.,"Imatinib mesylate is currently the standard therapy for chronic myelogenous leukemia patients. Despite the remarkable results achieved with imatinib, the emergence of resistance to this drug has become a significant problem. Actually, two other second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors have been used for resistant/intolerant patients to imatinib. With the availability of oral tyrosine kinase inhibitors for the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia, questions relating to adherence to prescribed therapy have become an important issue. It has been demonstrated that the effectiveness of the treatment with imatinib requires high compliance to the prescribed dose of the drug for an indefinite period of time, whereas reduced adherence to therapy has been associated with delay in achieving cytogenetic or molecular response and/or possible development of resistance. The aim of this review is to discuss the importance of adherence, and the possible tools that we have to measure it, to improve our knowledge on possible underlying causes of non-adherence and the impact of non-adherence on hospitalization risk and healthcare cost through a systematic review of the data published to date.","['Department of Cellular Biotechnology and Hematology, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy. breccia@bce.uniroma1.it']",,,,,['Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

However, graft versus leukemia (GVL) effects in ALL are generally weak and the mechanisms of this weakness are unknown. These studies tested the hypothesis that ALL cells that have survived conventional chemotherapy in vivo acquire relative resistance to the allogeneic GVL effect. C57BL/6 mice were injected with murine pre-B ALL lines driven by human mutations and then were treated with combination chemotherapy. ALL cells surviving therapy were analysed in vitro and in vivo for acquisition of resistance to chemotherapy, radiation, cytolytic T cells, NK cells, LAK cells and cytokines. In vivo drug treatment did lead to leukemia population with more rapid proliferation and also decreased sensitivity to vincristine, doxorubicin and radiation. However, drug treatment did not produce ALL populations that were less sensitive to GVL effects in vitro or in vivo.","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Rochester, Medical Center, Rochester, NY 14642, USA.']","['R01 CA106289-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1R01CA10628/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3050996,['NIHMS253175'],,['Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Epub 2010 Nov 11.,"BACKGROUND: Pandemic 2009 influenza A/H1N1 (H1N1v) is resistant to adamantanes, leaving neuraminidase inhibitors as the only therapeutic option. Other mutations are considered to be associated with virulence and clinical severity. However, out of the surveillance programs, few studies analyze the presence of resistance/virulent H1N1v variants in certain clinical circumstances. OBJECTIVES: To define the frequency and role of resistance and virulence mutations in a specific clinical circumstance-in patients with persistent infection by H1N1v. STUDY DESIGN: Observational study of patients with persistent H1N1v infection admitted to our hospital. RESULTS: NAI-resistance mutations were detected in 14.3% of cases with persistent infection (2/14), and in none of the non-persistent controls (0/15). These cases were initially infected with susceptible variants that acquired resistance at different time-points after therapy with oseltamivir (OTV). The first case (case 2) was an HIV-positive patient who rapidly acquired resistance 9 days after diagnosis (6 days on OTV) and whose infection resolved after standard OTV therapy. The second case (case 3) was a patient with chronic lymphocytic leukemia [corrected] and the longest viral persistence (59 days). The resistance mutation was detected in the specimen taken on day 37 after diagnosis (30 days on OTV). Once the resistance mutation was identified, OTV was substituted by zanamivir and the infection resolved. In addition to mutations encoding resistance, variants associated with virulence were also sought. The D225G mutation was not found in any case, whereas the D225E variant was identified in three persistent cases but also in two non-persistent ones. In one patient, the D225E substitution coincided with the H275 resistant mutation. CONCLUSIONS: NAI-resistance mutations were detected, at rather different paces, in non-severe immunosuppressed cases with persistent infection by influenza A/H1N1v.","['Servicio de Microbiologia Clinica y Enfermedades Infecciosas, Hospital General Universitario Gregorio Maranon, Madrid, Spain; CIBER Enfermedades Respiratorias (CIBERES), Spain.']",,,,,['Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Epub 2010 Nov 11.,"PURPOSE: To start total body irradiation (TBI) treatments, physical parameters are measured for a magna field irradiation. METHODS AND MATERIALS: 6 MV photon beam from Clinac 600 CD linear accelerator (Varian, USA) with fully opened collimator at 45 degrees and gantry at 270 degrees provided a diamond shaped magna field with diagonal dimension 224 cm at 4.0 m source skin distance (SSD). The flatness of the radiation field was measured in the presence of locally designed acrylic beam spoiler and beam flatness filter. Central Axis Depth dose data (CADD), tissue maximum ratios and entrance dose pattern are measured using large phantoms. Methods for clinical dose estimation using semi-conductor diodes and TLD were standardized. RESULTS: PVC beam flattener at the shielding tray position and the presence of acrylic beam spoiler in the radiation field provided a flatness of 100.15% +/- 0.44% compared to open beam flatness 101.6 +/- 1.5%. A reduction of 2% in percentage depth dose was observed at 10 cm depth in the presence of 15 mm acrylic beam spoiler. However, no changes are observed in the TMRs with presence of beam spoiler. The measured ionization ratios clearly showed change of beam quality with the introduction of beam spoiler. The presence of 15 mm beam spoiler ensured entrance dose 100% at skin and remaining unchanged within 1% upto a depth of 10 mm. Phantom measurements show good agreement between calculated and measured doses. CONCLUSIONS: The paper recommends use of modified CADD parameters for treatment planning, if calibration of output is carried out in the presence of beam spoiler.","['Medical Physics Unit, Oman. ravichandranrama@rediffmail.com']",,,,,['Copyright (c) 2010.

Epub 2010 Nov 11.,"It is now well accepted that taxol exhibits cytotoxicity and antitumor activity in many human tumors through microtubule stabilization and induction of G2/M cell cycle arrest with final extensive cell apoptosis. Since many anti-cancer agents exert their cytotoxic effects through reactive oxygen species (ROS), we were interested to evaluate whether oxidative stress is involved in taxol-induced cytotoxicity among human leukemia K562 cells. Our results showed that induction of apoptosis was associated with generation of ROS and glutathione (GSH) depletion. The increase in ROS production and apoptosis were both suppressed by antioxidant N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC). Moreover, taxol caused an increase in c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 activities, two of the well known mediators of the stress activation pathways. Attenuation of JNK expression in the presence of NAC might indicate the modulation of the level of JNK activity by ROS. Furthermore, our data indicated that Bcl-2alpha was down-regulated in taxol-treated cells and its expression was modulated by ROS and JNK activity. The activities of caspase-9 and -3 were also increased upon treatment with taxol; however, pre-treatment of cells with NAC or JNK inhibitor (SP600125) impeded taxol-mediated caspase activation and apoptosis in K562 cells, suggesting that JNK acts upstream of the caspases. Taken together, these results indicate that taxol induces apoptosis in chronic myelogenous leukemia cells by inducing intracellular oxidative stress and JNK activation pathway.","['Institute of Biochemistry and Biophysics, PO Box 13145-1384, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran.']",,,,,['Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier GmbH.

GTPase regulator associated with focal adhesion kinase (GRAF), a putative tumor suppressor gene, was revealed with mutations and promoter methylation in AML and myelodysplastic syndrome. In this study, we investigated the methylation status of GRAF promoter in Chinese AML patients. Aberrant methylation of GRAF promoter was detected in 66.7% (88/132) of the cases analyzed. The methylation of GRAF gene could be detected in all FAB subtypes and in all cytogenetic risk groups. There were no significant differences in clinical features, FAB subtypes and cytogenetic risk groups between patients with and without GRAF methylation. GRAF transcript was significantly lower in AML group compared to controls (3.30 vs 56.06, P<0.001). Both patients with methylated GRAF gene and those without methylated GRAF gene had significantly lower GRAF transcript than controls (P<0.001). Furthermore, GRAF transcript was significantly lower in patients with methylated GRAF than those without methylated GRAF (1.64 vs 6.42, P=0.005). These findings suggest that the hypermethylation of GRAF promoter might be one of early events in the development of AML.","[""Department of Hematology, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, China.""]",,,,,['Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Recent findings of selective human cancer cell-killing activity in non-insecticidal Bt isolates resulted in a new category of Bt parasporal protein called parasporin. However, little is known about the receptor molecules that bind parasporins and the mechanism of anti-cancer activity. A Malaysian Bt isolate, designated Bt18 produces parasporal protein that exhibit preferential cytotoxic activity for human leukaemic T cells (CEM-SS) but is non-cytotoxic to normal T cells or other cancer cell lines such as human cervical cancer (HeLa), human breast cancer (MCF-7) and colon cancer (HT-29) suggesting properties similar to parasporin. In this study we aim to identify the binding protein for Bt18 in human leukaemic T cells. METHODS: Bt18 parasporal protein was separated using Mono Q anion exchange column attached to a HPLC system and antibody was raised against the purified 68-kDa parasporal protein. Receptor binding assay was used to detect the binding protein for Bt18 parasporal protein in CEM-SS cells and the identified protein was sent for N-terminal sequencing. NCBI protein BLAST was used to analyse the protein sequence. Double immunofluorescence staining techniques was applied to localise Bt18 and binding protein on CEM-SS cell. RESULTS: Anion exchange separation of Bt18 parasporal protein yielded a 68-kDa parasporal protein with specific cytotoxic activity. Polyclonal IgG (anti-Bt18) for the 68-kDa parasporal protein was successfully raised and purified. Receptor binding assay showed that Bt18 parasporal protein bound to a 36-kDa protein from the CEM-SS cells lysate. N-terminal amino acid sequence of the 36-kDa protein was GKVKVGVNGFGRIGG. NCBI protein BLAST revealed that the binding protein was Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). Double immunofluorescence staining showed co-localisation of Bt18 and GAPDH on the plasma membrane of the CEM-SS cells. CONCLUSIONS: GAPDH has been well known as a glycolytic enzyme, but recently GAPDH was discovered to have roles in apoptosis and carcinogenesis. Pre-incubation of anti-GAPDH antibody with CEM-SS cells decreases binding of Bt18 to the susceptible cells. Based on a qualitative analysis of the immunoblot and immunofluorescence results, GAPDH was identified as a binding protein on the plasma membrane of CEM-SS cells for Bt18 parasporal protein.","['Department of Pharmacy, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, International Medical University, No 126 Jalan 19/155B Bukit Jalil, Kuala Lumpur, 57000 Malaysia.']",,PMC2996362,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The family of leukocytes is comprised of lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, basophils, and neutrophils. Any infection or acute stress may increase or decrease the number of leukocytes. An increased percentage of neutrophils may be caused by an acute infection, while an increased percentage of lymphocytes can be caused by a chronic bacterial infection. It is important to realize an abnormal variation in the leukocytes. The five types of leukocytes can be distinguished by their cytoplasmic granules, staining properties of the granules, size of cell, the proportion of the nuclear to the cytoplasmic material, and the type of nucleolar lobes. The number of lobes increased when leukemia, chronic nephritis, liver disease, cancer, sepsis, and vitamin B12 or folate deficiency occurred. Clinical neutrophil hypersegmentation has been widely used as an indicator of B12 or folate deficiency.Biomedical technologists can currently recognize abnormal leukocytes using human eyes. However, the quality and efficiency of diagnosis may be compromised due to the limitations of the biomedical technologists' eyesight, strength, and medical knowledge. Therefore, the development of an automatic leukocyte recognition system is feasible and necessary. It is essential to extract the leukocyte region from a blood smear image in order to develop an automatic leukocyte recognition system. The number of lobes increased when leukemia, chronic nephritis, liver disease, cancer, sepsis, and vitamin B12 or folate deficiency occurred. Clinical neutrophil hypersegmentation has been widely used as an indicator of B12 or folate deficiency. RESULTS: The purpose of this paper is to contribute an automatic leukocyte nuclei image segmentation method for such recognition technology. The other goal of this paper is to develop the method of counting the number of lobes in a cell nucleus. The experimental results demonstrated impressive segmentation accuracy. CONCLUSIONS: Insensitive to the variance of images, the LNS (Leukocyte Nuclei Segmentation) method functioned well to isolate the leukocyte nuclei from a blood smear image with much better UR (Under Segmentation Rate), ER (Overall Error Rate), and RDE (Relative Distance Error). The presented LC (Lobe Counting) method is capable of splitting leukocyte nuclei into lobes. The experimental results illuminated that both methods can give expressive performances. In addition, three advanced image processing techniques were proposed as weighted Sobel operator, GDW (Gradient Direction Weight), and GBPD (Genetic-based Parameter Detector).","['Department of Management Information Systems, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung, ROC, Taiwan.']",,PMC3224570,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2010 Nov 13.,"IMPORTANCE OF THE FIELD: Although the introduction of imatinib revolutionized the management of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), some patients exhibit resistance or intolerance to the drug. Nilotinib induces high and rapid rates of cytogenetic and molecular responses. With recent approval for newly diagnosed patients with chronic phase CML, the current algorithm for treatment will probably be transformed. AREAS COVERED IN THIS REVIEW: This review will describe evaluations of nilotinib in all phases of CML from 1995 to the present. Early preclinical data and Phase I, Phase II and Phase III evaluations will demonstrate the role of nilotinib in newly diagnosed CML, as well as in imatinib-resistant or imatinib-intolerant disease. WHAT THE READER WILL GAIN: Mutations in the BCR-ABL kinase domain are responsible for the majority of resistance to imatinib. In comparison with imatinib, nilotinib displays increased selectivity and potency at inhibiting proliferation of BCR-ABL expressing cells. Although several mutations, including T315I, remain resistant to nilotinib, activity in all phases of CML has been reported. TAKE HOME MESSAGE: Nilotinib induces high and rapid rates of cytogenetic and molecular response, with less progression to advanced forms of disease compared with imatinib. Considering that the rapid achievement of these clinical milestones has been associated with positive long-term outcomes, nilotinib as initial therapy in patients with CML in chronic phase represents the future in CML treatment. Longer follow-up is necessary to recognize survival advantages.","['The University of Texas, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Department of Leukemia, Houston, 77030, USA.']",['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is particularly true for costly orphan drugs because access depends primarily on co-payments, reimbursement policies and prices. The objective of this article is to identify differences in the availability of orphan drugs and in patient access to them in 11 pharmaceutical markets: Australia, Canada, England, France, Germany, Hungary, the Netherlands, Poland, Slovakia, Switzerland and the US. METHODS: Four rare diseases were selected for analysis: pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), Fabry disease (FD), hereditary angioedema (HAE) and chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML). Indicators for availability were defined as (i) the indications for which orphan drugs had been authorized in the treatment of these diseases; (ii) the application date; and (iii) the date upon which these drugs received market authorization in each country. Indicators of patient access were defined as (i) the outcomes of technology appraisals; (ii) the extent of coverage provided by healthcare payers; and (iii) the price of the drugs in each country. For PAH we analysed bosentan, iloprost, sildenafil, treprostinil (intravenous and inhaled) as well as sitaxentan and ambrisentan; for FD we analysed agalsidase alfa and agalsidase beta; for HAE we analysed icatibant, ecallantide and two complement C1s inhibitors; for CML we analysed imatinib, dasatinib and nilotinib. RESULTS: Most drugs included in this study had received market authorization in all countries, but the range of indications for which they had been authorized differed by country. The broadest range of indications was found in Australia, and the largest variations in indications were found for PAH drugs. Authorization process speed (the time between application and market authorization) was fastest in the US, with an average of 362 days, followed by the EU (394 days). The highest prices for the included drugs were found in Germany and the US, and the lowest in Canada, Australia and England. Although the prices of all of the included drugs were high compared with those of most non-orphan drugs, most of the insurance plans in our country sample provided coverage for authorized drugs after a certain threshold. CONCLUSIONS: Availability of and access to orphan drugs play a key role in determining whether patients will receive adequate and efficient treatment. Although the present study showed some variations between countries in selected indicators of availability and access to orphan drugs, virtually all of the drugs in question were available and accessible in our sample. However, substantial co-payments in the US and Canada represent important barriers to patient access, especially in the case of expensive treatments such as those analysed in this study. Market exclusivity is a strong instrument for fostering orphan drug development and drug availability. However, despite the positive effect of this instrument, the conditions under which market exclusivity is granted should be reconsidered in cases where the costs of developing an orphan drug have already been amortized through the use of the drug's active ingredient for the treatment of a common indication.","['German Research Center for Environmental Health, Munich, Germany. rudolf.blankart@wiso.uni-hamburg.de']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines (EBV-LCLs) with either of 2 well known polymorphic variations of C609T and C465T were selected from our archives of EBV-LCL clones and studied the induction of p53 expression after DNA damage. Irradiation of cells with C609T/C609T polymorphism (NQO1 *2*2) did not affect the induction of p53 expression. However, irradiation of cells with C465T/WT polymorphism (NQO1 *1*3) resulted in attenuation of p53 and p21 induction. Our results suggest that increased risk of infant leukemia development in patients with NQO1 *1*3 polymorphism is partially dependent on the inhibition of p53 pathway, though further studies are needed to fully understand the pathological role of C465T variant in the development of childhood leukemia.","['Department of Pediatrics and Developmental Biology, Graduate School of Medicine, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, 1-5-45 Yushima, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 113-8519, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SCN is also a premalignant condition; a significant proportion of patients develop myelodysplastic syndrome or leukemia (MDS/L). Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the only curative treatment for SCN. PROCEDURE: Since 2004, eight HSCT have been performed in seven patients at our center. The indications were transformation to MDS/L (n = 2), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor (CSF3R) mutation(s) (n = 2), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) resistance (n = 2), and at the patient's own request (n = 1). RESULTS: The mean age at transplantation was 13 years (2.8-28 years) (mean follow-up 32 months, range 21-60). Three patients harbored ELANE mutations, three HAX1 mutations, and in one patient no causative mutation was identified. Two of the ELANE mutations were novel mutations. Three patients initially received myeloablative conditioning and four had reduced intensity conditioning (RIC). Three grafts were from HLA-identical siblings, three from matched unrelated donors and two were cord blood units. Engraftment occurred in all patients. Two of seven (29%) patients died; both had MDS/L and both were among the three that underwent myeloablative conditioning. One patient has chronic GVHD 2 years post-transplant. CONCLUSIONS: The role of HSCT should be explored further in patients with SCN. In particular, the influence of the conditioning regime needs to be evaluated in a larger cohort of patients.","[""Childhood Cancer Research Unit, Department of Women's and Children's Health, Karolinska University Hospital, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.""]",,,,,"['(c) 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) routinely receive blood transfusions during therapy, although few studies to date have quantified transfusion-related iron burden in these patients. This study quantifies the transfused blood volume and resultant iron load in a large cohort of pediatric patients with ALL, and evaluates risk factors that may impact transfusion volume. METHODS: This single institution retrospective study evaluated 107 patients who completed therapy for ALL between July 1995 and March 2007. Age, weight, and hemoglobin at presentation, ALL risk category, leukemia cell type, and volume of blood transfusions were collected from medical records. RESULTS: Patients received an average of 115 ml/kg of blood (77 mg/kg iron) during treatment. There was a significant association between the volume of packed red blood cells and ALL risk category. Patients with standard-risk disease received 90 ml/kg (60 mg/kg iron), patients with high-risk disease 196 ml/kg (131 mg/kg iron) and patients with T-cell disease 114 ml/kg (76 mg/kg iron). There was no correlation between age or hemoglobin at presentation with amount of blood received. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with ALL often receive a substantial amount of iron during therapy, with patients with high-risk disease receiving the greatest load. As iron overload has an overlapping toxicity profile with chemotherapy and is treatable, screening for increased iron burden and iron-related morbidities should be considered during long-term follow-up of patients with ALL, particularly in those with high-risk ALL.","[""Pediatric Hematology/Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Steven and Alexandra Cohen Children's Medical Center of New York, New Hyde Park, New York, USA.""]",,,,,"['(c) 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When administered with a pharmacokinetically (PK)-directed dosing schedule, flavopiridol exhibited striking activity in patients with refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia. This study aimed to evaluate pharmacogenetic factors associated with inter-individual variability in pharmacokinetics and outcomes associated with flavopiridol therapy. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Thirty-five patients who received single-agent flavopiridol via the PK-directed schedule were genotyped for 189 polymorphisms in genes encoding 56 drug metabolizing enzymes and transporters. Genotypes were evaluated in univariate and multivariate analyses as covariates in a population PK model. Transport of flavopiridol and its glucuronide metabolite was evaluated in uptake assays in HEK-293 and MDCK-II cells transiently transfected with SLCO1B1. Polymorphisms in ABCC2, ABCG2, UGT1A1, UGT1A9, and SLCO1B1 were found to significantly correlate with flavopiridol PK in univariate analysis. Transport assay results indicated both flavopiridol and flavopiridol-glucuronide are substrates of the SLCO1B1/OATP1B1 transporter. Covariates incorporated into the final population PK model included bilirubin, SLCO1B1 rs11045819 and ABCC2 rs8187710. Associations were also observed between genotype and response. To validate these findings, a second set of data with 51 patients was evaluated, and overall trends for associations between PK and PGx were found to be consistent. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Polymorphisms in transport genes were found to be associated with flavopiridol disposition and outcomes. Observed clinical associations with SLCO1B1 were functionally validated indicating for the first time its relevance as a transporter of flavopiridol and its glucuronide metabolite.

Using targeted approaches against components of the superoxide-producing NADPH-oxidases, including NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX2), NOX4 and the common p22(phox) subunit of NOX1-4, myeloid cells were found to display reduced cell growth and spontaneous migration. Consistent with a role of NOXs as regulators of membrane proximal signaling events in nonphagocytic cells, NOX2 and NOX4 were not involved in the excess production of intracellular reactive oxygen species and did not significantly increase oxygen consumption. All NOX family members are controlled in part through levels of the rate-limiting substrate NADPH, which was found to be significantly elevated in TKO-transformed cells. Also, reduced phosphorylation of the actin filament crosslinking protein myristoylated alanine-rich C-kinase substrate (MARCKS) in response to suppression of p22(phox) hints at a novel effector of NOX signaling. MARCKS was also found to be required for increased migration. Overall, these data suggest a model whereby NOX links metabolic NADPH production to cellular events that directly contribute to transformation.","[""Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.""]","['5R01CA129501-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA125541/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA066996/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA129501/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5R01CA134660-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5P01CA66996-12/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA134660/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5R01CA125541-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC4078661,['NIHMS239558'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In our study, we used mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomic approaches to characterize de novo AML. Fifty-four samples (mononuclear cells from bone marrow or peripheral blood mononuclear cells collected and frozen before treatment) from two independent cohorts of newly diagnosed AML patients were analyzed. We showed that the protein signature of leukemic cells defined two clusters that displayed significant variation for overall and disease-free survival (P=0.001 and 0.0004, respectively). This proteomic classification refines the cytogenetic classes. AML patients with intermediate and unfavorable cytogenetic classifications could be subdivided according to their protein profiles into subgroups with significantly different survival rates. Among the proteins expressed by leukemic cells, we isolated a 10,800-Da marker that retained the highest discriminative value between living and deceased patients. The 10,800-Da marker was identified by MS peptide sequencing as S100A8 (also designated MRP8 or calgranulin A). Western blot analysis confirmed its expression mainly in AML patients with the worst prognosis, arguing for a selective deregulation associated with poor prognosis. These results suggest that the expression of S100A8 in leukemic cells is a predictor of low survival.","['Department of Clinical Onco-Hematology and University Joseph Fourier, Grenoble, France.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We recently reported the increased presence of PKR phosphorylated on Thr451 (p-T451 PKR) in clinical samples from myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients and acute leukemia cell lines. Whereas p-T451 PKR in low-risk patient samples or PTEN-positive acute leukemia cell lines was mostly cytoplasmic, in high-risk patient samples and acute leukemia cell lines deficient in PTEN, p-T451 PKR was mainly nuclear. As nuclear activity of PKR has not been previously characterized, we examined the status of nuclear PKR in acute leukemia cell lines. Using antibodies to N-terminus, C-terminus and the kinase domain in conjunction with a proteomics approach, we found that PKR exists in diverse molecular weight forms in the nucleus. Analysis of PKR transcripts by reverse transcriptase-PCR, and PKR-derived peptides by MS/MS revealed that these forms were the result of post-translational modifications (PTMs). Biochemical analysis demonstrated that nuclear PKR is an active kinase that can respond to stress. Given the association of PKR with PTEN and the Fanconi complex, these results indicate that PKR likely has other previously unrecognized roles in nuclear signaling that may contribute to leukemic development.","['Department of Human Anatomical Sciences, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Subgroup analyses were performed according to risk stratification on the basis of white blood cell count and cytogenetics, and according to age stratification. In analyses without QOL adjustments, allogeneic HSCT in first remission was superior in the whole population (48.3 vs 32.6%) and in all subgroups.

Asparaginase sensitivity was assessed as the drug concentration necessary to inhibit 50% of growth (inhibitory concentration (IC)(50)). In CEU lines, we tested 2,390,203 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotypes at the individual SNP (P<0.001) and gene level (P<0.05), and identified 329 SNPs representing 94 genes that were associated with asparaginase IC(50).

Both shRNA-mediated knockdown of Lmo2 expression and pharmacological inhibition of BCL-2 function in E2A-HLF immortalized cells severely compromised their viability. These data suggest that both Lmo2 and Bcl-2 are required for the action of E2A-HLF in leukemogenesis.,"['Molecular Haematology and Cancer Biology Unit, Institute of Child Health, University College London, London, UK.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2010 Nov 12.,"Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) results from the expression of the BCR/ABL oncogene in a primitive hematopoietic cell. However, BCR/ABL-activated signaling mechanisms are dependent on the cellular context in which it is expressed, and mechanisms underlying primitive human hematopoietic cell transformation by BCR-ABL are not well understood. Our previous studies have shown that BCR/ABL-Y177 has an essential role in Ras activation and human hematopoietic progenitor transformation in CML. The adapter protein growth factor receptor-binding protein-2 (Grb2) can bind phosphorylated BCR/ABL-Y177, induce Grb2-SoS complex formation and activate Ras signaling. We investigated the role of Grb2 in CML progenitor transformation by cotransducing human CD34+ cells with lentivirus vectors expressing short hairpin RNA to Grb2 and retrovirus vectors expressing BCR/ABL. We show that Grb2 knockdown significantly inhibits proliferation and survival of BCR-ABL-expressing CD34+ cells, but not control CD34+ cells. Grb2 knockdown reduced mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activity in BCR-ABL-expressing hematopoietic cells. We conclude that inhibition of Grb2 expression demonstrates an important role in BCR-ABL-mediated MAPK activation and transformation of primary human hematopoietic cells.These results support further investigation of downstream effectors of Grb2-mediated signals and targeting of Grb2 interactions in the treatment of CML.","['Division of Hematopoietic Stem Cell and Leukemia Research, Department of Hematology and Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, CA 91010, USA.']","['R01 HL077847-01A1/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL077847/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL77847/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA095684/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA095684-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA095684/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3036781,['NIHMS237285'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In acute myeloid leukemia, MK has been shown to be prognostically worse than an otherwise complex karyotype. The current study examines whether the same holds true for myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). A total of 127 MDS patients (median age 70 years) with a complex karyotype were considered; 106 (83%) met the above-stipulated criteria for MK and 21 (17%) had a complex karyotype without monosomies. Survival was significantly inferior in patients with MK compared with those with a complex karyotype without monosomies (P=0.01; HR 1.9, 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 1.1-3.3). Multivariable analysis identified MK (P=0.002), advanced age (P=0.0004) and bone marrow blast percentage (0.04) as independent risk factors for survival. There was no difference in survival among MK patients further substratified by the presence or absence of monosomy 7 and/or monosomy 5. Although not statistically significant, leukemia-free survival was also worse with MK compared with complex karyotype without monosomies (P=0.09; HR 2.7, 95% CI 0.8-9.0). MK in MDS identifies a prognostically worse subgroup of patients with a complex karyotype, regardless of whether monosomy 7 or 5 is part of the MK component.","['Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905, USA.']",,,,,,,,['Leukemia. 2011 Jul;25(7):1207-9.

HiDAC consolidations resulted in a high rate of neutropenic fever, the lack of an appreciable benefit from EAFU, and rare IFI. Most likely because of the low incidence of IFI, use of fluconazole or another antifungal is not warranted in this setting.","['Department of Medicine, Medical College of Georgia, Augusta, USA.']",,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2010 S.

This investigation analyzes risk factors predicting admission to the intensive care unit in patients with acute myeloid leukemia eligible for induction chemotherapy, the outcome of these patients, and prognostic factors predicting their survival. DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 406 consecutive patients with de novo acute myeloid leukemia (15-89 years) were analyzed retrospectively. Markers recorded at the time of diagnosis included karyotype, fibrinogen, C-reactive protein, and Charlson comorbidity index. In patients requiring critical care, the value of the Simplified Acute Physiology Score II, the need for mechanical ventilation, and vasopressor support were recorded at the time of intensive care unit admission. The independent prognostic relevance of the parameters was tested by multivariate analysis. RESULTS: Sixty-two patients (15.3%) required intensive care, primarily due to respiratory failure (50.0%) or life-threatening bleeding (22.6%). Independent risk factors predicting intensive care unit admission were lower fibrinogen concentration, the presence of an infection, and comorbidity. The survival rate was 45%, with the Simplified Acute Physiology Score II being the only independent prognostic parameter (P<0.05). Survival was inferior in intensive care patients compared to patients not admitted to an intensive care unit. However, no difference between intensive care and non-intensive care patients was found concerning continuous complete remission at 6 years or survival at 6 years in patients who survived the first 30 days after diagnosis (non-intensive care patients: 28%; intensive care patients: 20%, P>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Ongoing infections, low fibrinogen and comorbidity are predictive for intensive care unit admission in acute myeloid leukemia. Although admission was a risk factor for survival, continuous complete remission and survival of patients alive at day 30 were similar in patients who were admitted or not admitted to an intensive care unit.","['Division of Hematology & Hemostaseology, Department of Internal Medicine I, Medical University of Vienna, Waehringer Guertel 18-20, 1090 Vienna, Austria.']",,PMC3031690,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study aimed to characterize the relationship of this refractoriness with glucose availability in the environment. DESIGN AND METHODS: K562 or primary chronic myeloid leukemia cells were cultured at 0.1% O(2), different cell densities and glucose concentrations. The stem and progenitor cell potential of these cultures at different times of incubation in relation to BCR/Abl(protein) expression and sensitivity to imatinib-mesylate was explored by transferring cells to growth-permissive secondary cultures in normoxia, according to the Culture-Repopulating Ability assay methodology. RESULTS: Hypoxia-resistant cells maintained BCR/Abl(protein) expression until glucose was no longer available in primary hypoxic cultures, where glucose availability appeared to regulate cell number and the balance between the enrichment of cells with kinetic properties typical of stem or progenitor cells. Cells surviving merely hypoxic conditions were, upon transfer to secondary cultures, immediately available for numerical expansion due to the maintained BCR/Abl(protein) expression, and were consequently sensitive to imatinib-mesylate. Instead, BCR/Abl(protein)-negative cells selected in primary cultures under oxygen/glucose shortage underwent a delayed numerical expansion in secondary cultures, which was completely refractory to imatinib-mesylate. Cells with the latter properties were also found in primary chronic myeloid leukemia explants. CONCLUSIONS: Glucose shortage in hypoxia was shown to represent the condition selecting BCR/Abl(protein)-negative cells refractory to imatinib-mesylate from either chronic myeloid leukemia lines or patients. These cells, exhibiting stem cell properties in vitro, are metabolically suited to home to stem cell niches in vivo and so may represent the chronic myeloid leukemia cell subset responsible for minimal residual disease.","['Dipartimento di Patologia e Oncologia Sperimentali, Universita degli Studi di Firenze and Istituto Toscano Tumori, Viale G.B.

SETTING: Hospital in Huntsville, AL, in November 2007.Patient description: 21-year-old black woman admitted to the hospital for fever in the setting of pancytopenia. CASE SUMMARY: The patient had been diagnosed with acute promyelocytic leukemia 5 months before admission and continued on ATRA throughout induction and two consolidation therapies. Voriconazole was started in view of persistent fever and pancytopenia despite adequate broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy. On day 15 of voriconazole therapy, the patient complained of blurred vision, farsightedness, and dry skin with pruritus and was subsequently diagnosed with pseudotumor cerebri secondary to ATRA toxicity. All symptoms of pseudotumor cerebri resolved after discontinuation of ATRA. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Not applicable. RESULTS: The development of pseudotumor cerebri after initiation of voriconazole may have been secondary to the inhibition of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes. The interaction may have led to changes in ATRA serum concentrations, thus contributing to the observed adverse drug reaction. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first case report of pseudotumor cerebri in an adult patient secondary to metabolic inhibition of ATRA by voriconazole. This case illustrates the importance of monitoring for drug interactions when using medications metabolized via the CYP enzyme pathway.","['Department of Pharmacy, Huntsville Hospital, Huntsville, AL, USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Dysfunction of two specific sensory modalities, vision and proprioception, characterizes the phenotype of the rare, autosomal-recessive disorder posterior column ataxia and retinitis pigmentosa (PCARP). Using targeted DNA capture and high-throughput sequencing, we analyzed the entire 4.2 Mb candidate sequence on chromosome 1q32 to find the gene mutated in PCARP in a single family. Employing comprehensive bioinformatic analysis and filtering, we identified a single-nucleotide coding variant in the feline leukemia virus subgroup C cellular receptor 1 (FLVCR1), a gene encoding a heme-transporter protein. Sanger sequencing confirmed the FLVCR1 mutation in this family and identified different homozygous missense mutations located within the protein's transmembrane channel segment in two other unrelated families with PCARP. To determine whether the selective pathologic features of PCARP correlated with FLVCR1 expression, we examined wild-type mouse Flvcr1 mRNA levels in the posterior column of the spinal cord and the retina via quantitative real-time reverse-transcriptase PCR. The Flvcr1 mRNA levels were most abundant in the retina, followed by the posterior column of the spinal cord and other brain regions. These results suggest that aberrant FLVCR1 causes a selective degeneration of a subpopulation of neurons in the retina and the posterior columns of the spinal cord via dysregulation of heme or iron homeostasis. This finding broadens the molecular basis of sensory neural signaling to include common mechanisms that involve proprioception and vision.","['Department of Pediatrics, New York Presbyterian Hospital, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, 10065, USA.']",['Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],PMC2978959,,,"['Copyright (c) 2010 The American Society of Human Genetics.

Relapsed disease is frequently refractory to chemotherapy and exhibits multiple drug resistance. Therefore, it is important to identify the mechanism by which cancer cells develop resistance. In this study, we used microRNA (miRNA) microarray and qRT-PCR approaches to investigate the expression of miRNAs in three leukaemia cell lines with different degrees of resistance to doxorubicin (DOX) compared with their parent cell line, K562. The expression of miR-331-5p and miR-27a was inversely correlated with the expression of a drug-resistant factor, P-glycoprotein (P-gp), in leukaemia cell lines with gradually increasing resistance. The development of drug resistance is regulated by the expression of the P-gp. Transfection of the K562 and, a human promyelocytic cell line (HL) HL60 DOX-resistant cells with miR-331-5p and miR-27a, separately or in combination, resulted in the increased sensitivity of cells to DOX, suggesting that correction of altered expression of miRNAs may be used for therapeutic strategies to overcome leukaemia cell resistance. Importantly, miR-331-5p and miR-27a were also expressed at lower levels in a panel of relapse patients compared with primary patients at diagnosis, further illustrating that leukaemia relapse might be a consequence of deregulation of miR-331-5p and miR-27a.","['Key Laboratory of Gene Engineering of the Ministry of Education, State Key Laboratory for Biocontrol, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.']",,PMC4394226,,,"['(c) 2011 The Authors Journal of Cellular and Molecular Medicine (c) 2011', 'Foundation for Cellular and Molecular Medicine/Blackwell Publishing Ltd.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tumour necrosis factor related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) is a promising therapeutic agent in many different types of tumours, but AML cells are relatively insensitive to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Here we show that TRAIL-induced apoptosis in AML cells is predominantly mediated by death receptor 4 (DR4) and not DR5. Therefore, we constructed a variant of TRAIL (rhTRAIL-C3) that is a strong inducer of DR4-mediated apoptosis. TRAIL-C3 demonstrated much stronger pro-apoptotic activity than wild-type (WT) TRAIL in a panel of AML cell lines as well as in primary AML blasts. The higher pro-apoptotic potential was further enhanced when the TRAIL mutant was used in combination with BMS-345541, a selective inhibitor of inhibitor-kappaB kinases. It illustrates that combination of this TRAIL variant with chemotherapeutics or other targeted agents can kill AML with high efficacy. This may represent a major advantage over the currently used therapies that have serious toxic side effects. The high efficacy of rhTRAIL-C3 containing therapies may enable the use of lower drug doses to reduce the toxic side effects and improve patient outcome. Our findings suggest that the rational design of TRAIL variants that target DR4 potentiate the death-inducing activity of TRAIL and offer a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of AML.","['Department of Biochemistry and the National Centre for Biomedical Engineering Science, National University of Ireland, Galway, Ireland.']",,PMC4394230,,,"['(c) 2011 The Authors Journal of Cellular and Molecular Medicine (c) 2011', 'Foundation for Cellular and Molecular Medicine/Blackwell Publishing Ltd.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The challenge is to amplify immune responses to combat tumour escape mechanisms. Infection and inflammation may have a role in prostate carcinogenesis, including the newly discovered xenotropic murine leukaemia virus (XMRV). These inflammatory states damage defence mechanisms and induce a high proliferative state favouring further mutation and impaired immune surveillance. With this knowledge we are able to explore the use of immunotherapy to rejuvenate the immune system in combating CaP. Recently Sipuleucel-T, an immunotherapeutic agent for metastatic androgen independent CaP, has resulted in improved survival and might be the first immunotherapeutic agent to obtain approval for CaP treatment. This short review will focus on the growing body of evidence suggesting an immunity-based link between CaP and inflammation and infection.","['Department of Surgery, University of Melbourne, Austin Hospital, Urology Unit, Australia.']",,,,,['(c) 2010 THE AUTHORS; BJU INTERNATIONAL (c) 2010 BJU INTERNATIONAL.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We also show that amplified expression of JAK3 pathway genes in B-lineage ALL is associated with steroid resistance and relapse. Our findings further demonstrate that several different diagnostic classes of B-lineage lymphoid malignancies exhibit upregulated expression of JAK3 pathway genes, which are associated with an overexpression of genes for JAK3-stimulatory cytokines with concomitant deficiency of JAK3-inhibitory signaling molecules. Thus, despite the rare occurrence of activating JAK3 mutations, JAK3 appears to be constitutively active and represents a viable molecular target in the treatment of a broad range of B-lineage lymphoid malignancies, including B-lineage ALL.","[""Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Children's Center for Cancer and Blood Diseases, University of Southern California, Keck School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA 90027-0367, USA. fmuckun@chla.usc.edu""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In leukemia it is one of the two fused genes, along with ETV6, in a recurrent translocation frequently observed in infant AML. PROCEDURE: Here we investigate the role of epigenetic inactivation of the HLXB9 gene in leukemia. Quantitative DNA methylation analysis was performed using the COBRA assay, and qRT-PCR was used to assess the effects of methylation on expression in hematological cell lines and primary ALL samples. RESULTS: Hypermethylation of the HLXB9 gene was found to be a frequent event in childhood ALL, occurring in 33% of cases. However, it was rarely or never observed in other types of leukemia, including AML, CML, and CLL, with the exception of adult ALL, in which 39% of cases were hypermethylated. Furthermore, hypermethylation of HLXB9 results in loss of expression in hematological cell lines and primary ALL samples. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that HLXB9 may have a dual role in childhood leukemia, as an oncogene in infant AML but as a tumor suppressor in childhood ALL.","['Crucible Laboratory, Institute for Ageing and Health, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK.']",['Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council/United Kingdom'],,,,"['(c) 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A total of 340 APL patients admitted to the Department of Hematology from January 1988 to December 2009 were enrolled in this study. All patients received all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and/or arsenic trioxide (ATO) with anthracycline-based induction therapy. After three courses of consolidation chemotherapy, 279 patients received 2 years of maintenance therapy. Survival analyses were carried out using the Kaplan-Meier method and the Cox regression model. In total, 288 achieved CR with the CR rate of 84.7%, and 50 patients died during induction therapy. Univariate analysis identified the following three risk factors for hemorrhagic mortality: fibrinogen level (<1.0 g/l) (P = 0.0007), initial peripheral WBC count(>4 x 10(9)/l) (P = 0.0001), as well as the presence of coagulopathy(P < 0.0001). With a median follow-up of 49 (6-255) months, the estimated 5-year overall survival (OS) and relapse-free survival (RFS) were (89.0 +/- 2.4)% and (83.7 +/- 2.6)%, respectively. Cox regression analysis of the 290 patients showed initial WBC count, years of diagnosis, and the status of PML-RARalpha in remission seemed to be independent prognostic indicators for OS and RFS (P = 0.03, P < 0.01 and P = 0.0001, respectively).

Epub 2010 Nov 11.,"PURPOSE: 4'-Thio-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine (4'-thio-ara-C), which has shown a broad spectrum of antitumor activity against human tumor systems in mice and is undergoing clinical trials, was evaluated for cross-resistance to seven clinical agents in order to identify potentially useful guides for patient selection for further clinical trials of 4'-thio-ara-C and possible noncross-resistant drug combinations with 4'-thio-ara-C. METHODS: A drug resistance profile for 4'-thio-ara-C, which was administered intraperitoneally daily for nine consecutive days, was obtained using seven drug-resistant P388 and L1210 leukemias that were implanted intraperitoneally in mice. RESULTS: Multidrug-resistant P388 leukemias (leukemias resistant to doxorubicin, etoposide, or paclitaxel) exhibited no cross-resistance to 4'-thio-ara-C. Leukemias resistant to camptothecin, cisplatin, and 5-fluorouracil were also not cross-resistant to 4'-thio-ara-C. Only the leukemia resistant to 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine was cross-resistant to 4'-thio-ara-C. CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest that (1) it may be important to exclude or to monitor with extra care patients who have previously been treated with 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine and (2) the lack of cross-resistance seen with 4'-thio-ara-C may contribute to therapeutic synergism when 4'-thio-ara-C is combined with other agents.","['Cancer Therapeutics and Immunology Department, Southern Research Institute, Birmingham, AL 35255-5305, USA. waud@southernresearch.org']","['P01 CA034200/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA124952/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01-CA34200/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3128691,['NIHMS262557'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2010 Nov 8.,"PURPOSE: To retrospectively analyze patient characteristics, treatment, and treatment outcome of pediatric patients with hematologic diseases treated with total body irradiation (TBI) between 1978 and 2006. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 32 pediatric patients were referred to the Department of Radiation-Oncology at the University of Zurich for TBI. Records of regular follow-up of 28 patients were available for review. Patient characteristics as well as treatment outcome regarding local control and overall survival were assessed. A total of 18 patients suffered from acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), 5 from acute and 2 from chronic myelogenous leukemia, 1 from non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and 2 from anaplastic anemia. The cohort consisted of 15 patients referred after first remission and 13 patients with relapsed leukemia. Mean follow-up was 34 months (2-196 months) with 15 patients alive at the time of last follow-up. Eight patients died of recurrent disease, 1 of graft vs. host reaction, 2 of sepsis, and 2 patients died of a secondary malignancy. RESULTS: The 5-year overall survival rate (OS) was 60%. Overall survival was significantly inferior in patients treated after relapse compared to those treated for newly diagnosed leukemia (24% versus 74%; p=0.004). At the time of last follow-up, 11 patients survived for more than 36 months following TBI. Late effects (RTOG >/= 3) were pneumonitis in 1 patient, chronic bronchitis in 1 patient, cardiomyopathy in 2 patients, severe cataractogenesis in 1 patient (48 months after TBI with 10 Gy in a single dose) and secondary malignancies in 2 patients (36 and 190 months after TBI). Growth disturbances were observed in all patients treated prepubertally. In 2 patients with identical twins treated at ages 2 and 7, a loss of 8% in final height of the treated twin was observed. CONCLUSION: As severe late sequelae after TBI, we observed 2 secondary malignancies in 11 patients who survived in excess of 36 months. However, long-term morbidity is moderate following treatment with the fractionated TBI at the low-dose rate that was generally used here. Conditioning for bone marrow transplantation without radiation is an attractive option, but is not sufficiently effective to completely replace TBI for the most common pediatric indications.","['Department of Radiation-Oncology - University Hospital, Zurich, Switzerland. claudia.linsenmeier@usz.ch']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After upscaling of the methodology, serum-free retroviral gibbon-ape leukemia virus (GALV) pseudotype PG13/LN vector supernatant produced under strict good manufacturing practice (GMP) conditions was used in the first clinical gene-marking trial in Germany. In this study, we analyzed the titer and transduction efficiency of this serum-free clinical-grade retroviral supernatant 10 years after production to evaluate the long-term stability. Long-term storage and transport on dry ice resulted in modestly decreased titers and levels of transduction efficiency in CD34+ cells ranging from 38.4 to 49.1%. We conclude that the stability of retroviral vectors in serum-free medium allows extended storage and distribution of approved clinical-grade retroviral vector stocks to distant sites in multicenter clinical trials.","['Department of Translational Oncology, National Center for Tumor Diseases (NCT) and German Cancer Research Center, Im Neuenheimer Feld 350, Heidelberg, Germany.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2011 Jan 1.,"Damage-associated molecular pattern molecules (DAMPs) are cellularly derived molecules that can initiate and perpetuate immune responses following trauma, ischemia and other types of tissue damage in the absence of pathogenic infection. High mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) is a prototypical DAMP and is associated with the hallmarks of cancer. Recently we found that HMGB1 release after chemotherapy treatment is a critical regulator of autophagy and a potential drug target for therapeutic interventions in leukemia. Overexpression of HMGB1 by gene transfection rendered leukemia cells resistant to cell death; whereas depletion or inhibition of HMGB1 and autophagy by RNA interference or pharmacological inhibitors increased the sensitivity of leukemia cells to chemotherapeutic drugs. HMGB1 release sustains autophagy as assessed by microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3) lipidation, redistribution of LC3 into cytoplasmic puncta, degradation of p62 and accumulation of autophagosomes and autolysosomes. Moreover, these data suggest a role for HMGB1 in the regulation of autophagy through the PI3KC3-MEKERK: pathway, supporting the notion that HMGB1-induced autophagy promotes tumor resistance to chemotherapy.","['Department of Pediatrics, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, China.']",,PMC3039734,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2010 Nov 10.,"Phosphatidylserine (PS) is an essential constituent of biological membranes and plays critical roles in apoptosis and cell signaling. Because no information was available on transcriptional mechanisms that regulate PS biosynthesis in mammalian cells, we investigated the regulation of expression of the mouse PS synthase-1 (Pss1) gene. The Pss1 core promoter was characterized in vitro and in vivo through gel shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. Transcription factor-binding sites, such as a GC-box cluster that binds Sp1/Sp3/Sp4 and N-Myc, and a degenerate E-box motif that interacts with Tal1 and E47, were identified. Pss1 transactivation was higher in brain of neonatal mice than in other tissues, consistent with brain being a major site of expression of Pss1 mRNA and PSS1 activity. Enzymatic assays revealed that PSS1 activity is enriched in primary cortical astrocytes compared with primary cortical neurons. Site-directed mutagenesis of binding sites within the Pss1 promoter demonstrated that Sp and N-Myc synergistically activate Pss1 expression in astrocytes. Chromatin immunoprecipitation indicated that Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4 interact with a common DNA binding site on the promoter. Reduction in levels of Sp1, Sp3, or N-Myc proteins by RNA interference decreased promoter activity. In addition, disruption of Sp/DNA binding with mithramycin significantly reduced Pss1 expression and PSS1 enzymatic activity, underscoring the essential contribution of Sp factors in regulating PSS1 activity. These studies provide the first analysis of mechanisms that regulate expression of a mammalian Pss gene in brain.","['Department of Medicine, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta T6G 2S2, Canada.']",['Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada'],PMC3020713,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We also show that B-cell CLL/lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), B-cell lymphoma extra large (Bcl-X(L)), and myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1) are constitutively less abundant in mtDNA-depleted cells, that the inhibition of Bcl-2 and Bcl-X(L) can sensitize the parental cell line to staurosporine-induced apoptosis, and that overexpression of Bcl-2 or Bcl-X(L) can prevent the activation of caspase-3 in rho(0)143B cells treated with staurosporine. Moreover, the inactivation of cathepsin B with CA074-Me significantly reduced cytochrome c release, caspase-3 activation, PARP-1 cleavage, and DNA fragmentation in mtDNA-depleted cells, whereas the pan-caspase inhibitor failed to completely prevent PARP-1 cleavage and DNA fragmentation in these cells, suggesting that caspase-independent mechanisms are responsible for cell death even if caspases are activated. Finally, we show that cathepsin B is released in the cytosol of rho(0) cells in response to staurosporine, suggesting that the absence of mitochondrial activity leads to a facilitated permeabilization of lysosomal membranes in response to staurosporine.","['Laboratory of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Faculty of Sciences, University of Namur, 61 rue de Bruxelles, Namur, Belgium.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The girls underwent HSCT at 10.2 +/- 4.0 years of age (median +/- SD).The first evaluation was performed at 15.1 +/- 1.9 years of age, 3.8 +/- 3.4 years after HSCT. Bone mineral density increased significantly from -2.7 +/- 1.1 (Z-score) to -2.3 +/- 1.2 during HT administration for 5.7 +/- 2.5 years. Twenty-four of 28 patients (86%) showed a good response to HT. The levels of urinary N-telopeptides of type 1 collagen and serum osteocalcin were high at the first evaluation in 76% and 53% of patients and at the last in 76% and 18%, respectively, thereafter. CONCLUSION(S): Significant effects on bone metabolism resulting from HSCT were observed; however, HT increased bone mineral density of the hypogonadal patients.","['Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Osaka Medical Center and Research Institute for Maternal and Child Health, Osaka, Japan.']",,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2011 American Society for Reproductive Medicine.

The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)-Raptor signaling pathway is known to act downstream of AKT. Here we show that the mTOR effectors, 4EBP1, p70S6K and rpS6, are highly activated in cultured and primary FLT3-mutated acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells. Introduction of FLT3-ITD expressing constitutively activated FLT3 kinase further activates mTOR and its downstream effectors in BaF3 cells. We also found that mTOR signaling contributes to tumor cell survival, as demonstrated by pharmacologic inhibition of PI3K/AKT/mTOR, or total silencing of the mTOR gene. Furthermore, inhibition of FLT3 kinase results in downregulation of mTOR signaling associated with decreased survival of FLT3-mutated AML cells. These findings suggest that mTOR signaling operates downstream of activated FLT3 kinase thus contributing to tumor cell survival, and may represent a promising therapeutic target for AML patients with mutated-FLT3.","['Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Blvd, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.']",,PMC2993677,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Compared with Western patients with CLL, only 52.0% of cases showed the typical immunophenotypic profile. IgG-bearing (15.4%) and clearly CD20-expressing (71.4%) cases were frequently observed. Most cases harbored a mutated immunoglobulin heavy-chain (VH) gene (88.5%) and commonly used a VH3 family member (61.5%) other than VH3-21. During the median follow-up period of 64 months, 20 cases (71.4%) showed an indolent clinical course without any treatment, and six cases (21.4%) were accompanied by other malignancies.

Epub 2010 Nov 10.,"BACKGROUND: The genetic alterations responsible for an adverse outcome in most patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are unknown. METHODS: Using massively parallel DNA sequencing, we identified a somatic mutation in DNMT3A, encoding a DNA methyltransferase, in the genome of cells from a patient with AML with a normal karyotype. We sequenced the exons of DNMT3A in 280 additional patients with de novo AML to define recurring mutations. RESULTS: A total of 62 of 281 patients (22.1%) had mutations in DNMT3A that were predicted to affect translation. We identified 18 different missense mutations, the most common of which was predicted to affect amino acid R882 (in 37 patients). We also identified six frameshift, six nonsense, and three splice-site mutations and a 1.5-Mbp deletion encompassing DNMT3A. These mutations were highly enriched in the group of patients with an intermediate-risk cytogenetic profile (56 of 166 patients, or 33.7%) but were absent in all 79 patients with a favorable-risk cytogenetic profile (P<0.001 for both comparisons). The median overall survival among patients with DNMT3A mutations was significantly shorter than that among patients without such mutations (12.3 months vs. 41.1 months, P<0.001). DNMT3A mutations were associated with adverse outcomes among patients with an intermediate-risk cytogenetic profile or FLT3 mutations, regardless of age, and were independently associated with a poor outcome in Cox proportional-hazards analysis. CONCLUSIONS: DNMT3A mutations are highly recurrent in patients with de novo AML with an intermediate-risk cytogenetic profile and are independently associated with a poor outcome.

Epub 2010 Nov 10.,"BACKGROUND: Children with cancer have an increased susceptibility to influenza infection. The objective of this study was to assess the immunogenicity of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 vaccine in children with cancer. METHODS: Children were recruited from the Royal Marsden Hospital, England, during November 2009. The vaccination schedule consisted of 2 doses of an AS03(B)-adjuvanted vaccine given at days 0 and 21. Serological analysis was performed on blood samples obtained at day 0 and day 42. The primary immunological end point was the seroconversion rate, which was defined as the proportion of subjects with an individual 4-fold increase in hemagglutination inhibition titer and a postvaccination hemagglutination inhibition titer >/=1:32. RESULTS: Fifty-four children with a median age of 6.3 years (range, 1.4-16.6 years) were vaccinated and had samples taken for serological analysis. Twenty-four (44.4%) of 54 children demonstrated seroconversion. Seroconversion rates were 33.3% (9 of 27) among children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, 36.4% (4 of 11) among those with lymphoma or other leukemias, 66.7% (6 of 9) among those with brain tumors, and 71.4% (5 of 7) among those with other solid tumors. Seroconversion occurred in 4 (28.6%) of 14 children receiving acute lymphoblastic leukemia maintenance therapy. Univariate analysis showed significantly higher responses among children with solid tumors, compared with those with hematological malignancies (11 [68.8%] of 16 vs 13 [34.2%] of 38; P = .03), and among those not receiving treatment, compared with those receiving treatment (7 [87.5%] of 8 vs 17 [37.0%] of 46; P = .02). Multivariable analysis showed that age, cancer type, and lymphopenia did not influence seroconversion rates. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that this AS03(B)-adjuvanted pandemic (H1N1) 2009 vaccine can induce limited but useful protective immune responses in children with cancer.","[""Dept of Child Health, St George's, University of London, London, England. jbate@sgul.ac.uk""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The animals (n = 60/strain) were irradiated with (5)(6)Fe(26+) (1 GeV) to total doses of 0, 0.5, 2 and 3 Gray (Gy) at an average dose rate of 1 Gy/min and euthanised on days 4 and 30 thereafter; blood, spleen, and bone marrow were collected for flow cytometry analyses. Cells expressing the following molecules were quantified: Cluster of differentiation (CD) 4, CD8, CD25, CD34, CD71, B220 (isoform of CD45 on B cells), NK1.1 (marker on natural killer or NK cells, C57B mice), panNK (marker on NK cells, CBA mice), and Sca1 (stem cell antigen 1). RESULTS: Exposure to radiation resulted in different distribution patterns in lymphocyte populations and leukocytes expressing activation and progenitor markers in the two mouse strains. Significant main effects were dependent upon strain, as well as radiation dose, body compartment, and time of assessment. Especially striking differences were noted on day 4 after 3 Gy irradiation, including in the CD4:CD8 ratio [blood, C57 (2.83 +/- 0.25) vs. CBA (6.19 +/- 0.24); spleen, C57 (2.29 +/- 0.12) vs. CBA (4.98 +/- 0.22)], %CD25(+) mononuclear cells in bone marrow [C57 (5.62 +/- 1.19) vs. CBA (12.45 +/- 0.93)] and %CD34(+)Sca1(+) cells in bone marrow [CD45(1) degrees gate, C57 (2.72 +/- 0.74) vs. CBA (21.44 +/- 0.73)]. CONCLUSION: The results show that genetic background, as well as radiation dose and time post-exposure, had a profound impact on lymphocyte populations, as well as other leukocytes, after exposure to iron ion radiation.","['Department of Radiation Medicine, Radiation Research Laboratories, Divisions of Microbiology & Biochemistry, Loma Linda University and Medical Center, Loma Linda, California 92354, USA. dgridley@dominion.llumc.edu']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2010 Nov 10.,"PURPOSE: To investigate the effect of ubiquitin-like with plant homeodomain (PHD) and ring finger domains 1 (UHRF1) overexpression on radiosensitivity to X-rays in human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cell survival was determined by colony formation assay; cell cycle distribution was measured by flow cytometry; apoptosis was evaluated by DNA fragmentation assay and Annexin V apoptosis detection kit; protein expression was analysed by Western blot assay; chromosome aberrations (centric rings and dicentrics) were assayed by conventional chromosome analysis. RESULTS: A significant decrease of radiosensitivity to X-rays was observed in MDA-MB-231 cells transfected with a full-length of human UHRF1 cDNA (MDA-MB-231/UHRF1) compared to the control cells (MDA-MB-231/parental and MDA-MB-231/pcDNA3 [mammalian expression vector]), and the similar results were observed in MDA-MB-468 cells. In contrast, a decreased expression of UHRF1 by a specific UHRF1-small interfering RNA (siRNA) significantly enhanced cell radiosensitivity. The UHRF1-mediated radioresistance was correlated with a G2(Ra)/M arrest, a decreased induction of apoptosis, a down-regulation of the pro-apoptotic protein anti-B cell lymphoma/leukemia 2 (bcl-2) associated X protein (Bax) and a up-regulation of the DNA damage repair proteins Lupus Ku autoantigen protein p70 (Ku-70) and Lupus Ku autoantigen protein p80 (Ku-80). Furthermore, chromosomal aberrations (centric rings and dicentrics) by X-rays were less in MDA-MB-231/UHRF1 than in MDA-MB-231/parental and MDA-MB-231/pcDNA3 control cells. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggested that UHRF1 may be a new target in the radiotherapy of breast cancer via affecting apoptosis and DNA damage repair.","['School of Radiation Medicine and Public Health, Medical College of Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu, P.

MS shows a risk association with Human leukocyte antigens (HLA)-DRA single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs3135388, which is a proxy marker for DRB1*1501. We examined the relevance of rs3135388 in childhood ALL risk along with two other HLA-DRA SNPs in two case-control groups: 114 cases and 388 controls from South Wales (UK) and 100 Mexican Mestizo cases and 253 controls. We first confirmed the correlation between rs3135388 and DRB1*1501 in HLA-typed reference cell lines. We noted a female-specific risk association in childhood ALL (pooled odds ratio (OR) = 2.6, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.5-4.5, Mantel-Haenszel P = 0.0009) similar to the stronger association of DRB1*1501 in females with MS. Examination of an HLA-C 5' flanking region SNP rs9264942, known to correlate with HLA-C expression, showed a protective association in girls (OR = 0.4, 95% CI = 0.2-0.7, Mantel-Haenszel P = 0.0003) similar to the protective HLA-Cw*05 association in MS. In a reference cell line panel, HLA-Cw5 homozygous samples (n = 8) were also homozygous for the minor allele of the SNP. Likewise, the male-specific protective association of interferon-gamma (IFNG) SNP rs2069727 in MS was replicated with the same sex specificity in childhood ALL (OR = 0.6, 95% CI = 0.4-1.0, Mantel-Haenszel P = 0.03). Two other SNPs in superkiller viralicidic activity 2-like and tenascin XB that are markers for systemic lupus erythematosus susceptibility showed female-specific associations but due to linkage disequilibrium with HLA-DRB1*15. Our observations supported the epidemiologic link between MS and childhood ALL and added the sex effect to this connection. It appears that only girls born to mothers with MS may have an increased risk of ALL. Investigating the mechanism of these sex-specific associations may help understand the pathogenesis of MS and ALL.","['Genomic Immunoepidemiology Laboratory, HUMIGEN LLC, The Institute for Genetic Immunology, Hamilton, NJ 08690-3303, USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we evaluated the dosage effects of HDAC inhibitors suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) and valproic acid (VPA) in a series of human leukaemia cell lines. We investigated, what concentration of SAHA and VPA can optimally induce apoptosis, growth inhibition or stress-induced premature senescence. We have found that SAHA inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis in concentration 1000x lower than VPA. The senescence phenotype was preferentially induced by lower dosage of HDACi and required longer incubation time (5 days) while apoptosis was induced by higher dosage and appeared already after 24h. The optimal doses for the induction of cell death are 2,5-5 muM of SAHA and 2,5-5 mM of VPA. These doses of HDACi induce both apoptosis and senescence of studied leukemia cell lines.","['Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, U Nemocnice 1,128 20 Prague 2, Czech Republic.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, the proteome alterations associated with the development of acquired resistance to cyclin-depedent kinases inhibitor bohemine, a promising anti-cancer drug, were analyzed with the primary aim of identifying potential targets of resistance within the cell that could pave a way to selective elimination of specific resistant cell types. A model of parental susceptible CEM T-lymphoblastic leukemia cells and its resistant counterpart CEM-BOH was used and advanced 2-D liquid chromatography was applied to fractionate cellular proteins. Differentially expressed identified proteins were further verified using immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry. Our study has revealed that Rho GDP-dissociation inhibitor 2, Y-box binding protein 1, and the HSP70/90 organizing protein have a critical role to play in resistance to cyclin-depedent kinases inhibitor. The results indicated not only that quantitative protein changes play an important role in drug-resistance, but also that there are various other parameters such as truncation, post-translational modification(s), and subcellular localization of selected proteins. Furthermore, these proteins were validated for their roles in drug resistance using different cell lines resistant to diverse representatives of anti-cancer drugs such as vincristine and daunorubicin.","['Institute of Animal Physiology and Genetics AS CR, vvi, Libechov, Czech Republic.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Resveratrol possesses anticancer activity, and studies have indicated that it induces programmed cell death (PCD) in human leukemia HL-60 cells. In this study, the anticancer activity of these stilbenoids was determined in HL-60 cells. Ara-1 had the highest efficacy in inducing PCD in HL-60 cells, with an approximately 4-fold lower EC50 than resveratrol. Ara-1 treatment caused mitochondrial membrane damage, activation of caspases, and nuclear translocation of apoptosis-inducing factor, resulting in chromosome degradation and cell death. Therefore, Ara-1 induces PCD in HL-60 cells through caspase-dependent and caspase-independent pathways. Ara-1 demonstrates its efficacy as an anticancer agent by inducing caspase-independent cell death, which is an alternative death pathway of cancer cells with mutations in key apoptotic genes.

It represents 25% of all childhood cancers and approximately 75% of all cases of childhood leukaemia. A sharp peak of ALL incidence is observed at 2-5 years of age. Objective was to see the bone marrow remission pattern at the end of induction therapy in paediatric ALL patients in our setup. It was a Descriptive case series and conducted at Paediatric Oncology Department, Children Hospital complex Multan from December, 2005 to December, 2008. METHODS: Thirty-eight paediatric ALL patients were included in the study. Diagnosis was based on history, examination, blast cells count on peripheral blood film and bone marrow biopsy and immunophenotyping on peripheral blood/bone marrow aspirate. According to UK ALL 2003 protocol all patients were given 4-drug induction therapy, i.e., vincristine, prednisolone/dexamethasone, L-aspiragenase and daunomycin. Bone marrow biopsy was repeated at day 28 of induction therapy and remission pattern was seen. RESULTS: Out of 38 Patients, 26 (68%) were males. Age range was between 2-12 years (Mean 5.4 years). Bone Marrow Biopsy was done in 38 (100%) and Immunophenotyping in 34 (89%) patients. At day 28 of induction therapy, 28 (74%) patients went into complete remission (< 5% blast cells in bone marrow), 2 (5%) into partial remission (5-25% blast cells in bone marrow) and 1 (3%) was not in remission (> 25% blast cells in the bone marrow). Seven (18%) patient died due to febrile neutropenia and sepsis during the course of induction therapy. CONCLUSION: ALL in children is curable with effective chemotherapy. Remission can be achieved in most of these patients after induction therapy. However outcome can be improved with effective control of infections.","['Department of Paediatric Oncology, Children Hospital Complex, Multan, Pakistan. dr.zalirana@gmail.com']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The pathogenesis of MTX-NT has mainly been associated with cerebral folate homeostasis, but the specific mechanism leading to the development of this complication is mostly unknown and is likely to be multifactorial. Most of studies aimed to determine putative genetic determinants of this syndrome have been focused on the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). However, there are other functional polymorphisms that have also been identified in enzymes and transporters related to MTX and folate homeostasis. In this context, we carried out an extensive genetic analysis through the screening of 21 SNPs in 11 relevant genes in a five-year-old girl with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who developed MTX-NT. The analysis revealed the presence of numerous genetic variants that may have accounted for the neurotoxicity observed. We discuss the putative role of MTX pharmacogenetics in the pathogenesis of MTX-NT.","['Department of Pediatric Hematology, University Hospital Infanta Cristina, Badajoz, Spain.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Given that the sources of the grafts were mostly unrelated donors (n = 226; 95.8%), only the results of unrelated UCBT were included for all statistics. The most frequent primary disease was acute leukemia (n = 167). In total, 91.7% of recipients were seropositive for cytomegalovirus (CMV). The median doses of nucleated cells and CD34+ cells were 4.84 x 10(7)/kg and 2.00 x 10(5)/kg, respectively. The median times to neutrophil (>0.5 x 10(9)/L) and platelet recovery (>20 x 10(9)/L) were 18 and 45 days, respectively. Grade 2-4 acute graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) and chronic GVHD developed in 41.1 and 36.1% of cases, respectively. Forty-five patients developed CMV disease. The 5-year overall and event-free survival were 47.5 and 36.9%, respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed that adverse factors for survival of the whole cohort were total body irradiation-based conditioning (P = 0.007), salvage transplant (P = 0.001), failure to achieve early complete chimerism (P < 0.0005), and CMV disease (P = 0.001). The outcomes of the single- and double-unit UCBT (n = 64) were similar, while double-unit recipients were heavier (P < 0.0005) and older (P < 0.0005). We conclude that double-unit UCBT is a reasonable option for older or heavier children and that the thorough surveillance of CMV infection and the development of an effective CMV therapeutic strategy may be especially important for Korean children, whose CMV seroprevalence exceeds 90%.","['Department of Pediatrics, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea.']",,,,,"['(c) 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2010 Dec 9.,"HTLV-I-associated adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) and human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I)-negative peripheral T-cell lymphomas carry poor prognosis mainly because of acquired resistance to chemotherapy. We have shown that this disease is responsive to the combination of zidovudine and interferon-alpha. However, long-term maintenance therapy with this combination is associated with side effects affecting patient quality of life and hence more tolerated alternatives are needed. In this submission, we explored the effect of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex-1 (mTORC1) inhibitor everolimus (RAD001) on ATL and HTLV-negative malignant T-cell lines. We demonstrate that, at clinically achievable concentrations, long-term treatment with everolimus resulted in a dramatic inhibitory effect on the growth of HTLV-I-positive and -negative malignant T-cells, while normal resting or activated T-lymphocytes were resistant. Everolimus specifically induced oncoprotein Tax degradation and senescence in ATL cells and cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in HTLV-I-negative malignant T-cells. Everolimus-mediated apoptosis was also associated with an upregulation of p53 upregulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA-alpha) proteins, an increase in Bax proteins and downregulation of Bcl-x(L) proteins in all tested HTLV-I-positive and -negative malignant cell lines. These results support a therapeutic role for everolimus, particularly as long-term maintenance therapy in patients with ATL and other HTLV-I-negative peripheral T-cell lymphomas.","['Department of Biology, American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon. nd03@aub.edu.lb']",,,,,['Copyright (c) 2010 UICC.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HTLV-I is endemic in southwestern Japan, the Caribbean and sub-Saharan Africa, whereas HTLV-II is more prevalent in intravenous drug addicts, and in American indian populations, endemically. HTLV-I is mainly responsible for adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) and HTLV-I-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP), however, HTLVII is not clearly associated with a known clinical disease. Both viruses may be transmitted by sexual contact, parenteral route, whole blood transfusion and breast-feeding. In most of the countries [USA, Canada, South America, Caribbean, Japan, Taiwan and some Europe countries (France, UK, Ireland, Sweden, Denmark, The Netherlands, Portugal, Romania, Greece)] routine screening of anti-HTLV-I/II in blood donors is mandatory, however, there is no such practice in Turkey since seroepidemiologic data on HTLVI/II infections is insufficient. In this study, the seroprevalence of HTLV-I/II in healthy blood donors admitted to the blood bank of Ege University Medical Faculty Hospital, Izmir (located at Aegean region), was investigated to support data on the decision making process on routine screening of anti-HTLV-I/II in blood centers. Serum samples from 10.000 healthy blood donors (mean age: 32.6 years; 87.8% were male), who succeeded the donor history questionnaire, were included to the study, and HTLV-I/II antibodies were screened by a commercial enzyme immunoassay (ELISA) (Murex HTLVI-II, Murex Diagnostics, UK) method. Serum samples which were yielded reactive and borderline results were retested by ELISA, and repeated reactive/borderline results were then confirmed by HTLV-I/II confirmation test (INNO-LIA HTLV-I/II, Innogenetics, Belgium). Seven samples yielded reactive/borderline reactive results by both ELISA lots, however, all of them were found negative by confirmatory test. According to our data HTLV-I/II infections are not endemic in Izmir region, and anti-HTLV-I/II screening of blood donors is not required in our blood center currently. Nevertheless, screening HIV which is very rare in prevalence among the donor population, is mandatory for blood donors in our country. Thus, even its prevalence is very low, much more comprehensive and multi-centered studies are necessary for making the decision of integrating HTLV-I/II in routine blood bank screening tests in Turkey.","['Ege Universitesi Tip Fakultesi, Mikrobiyoloji ve Klinik Mikrobiyoloji Anabilim Dali, Izmir, Turkiye. ruchan.sertoz@ege.edu.tr']",,,,,,,,,,,,,Izmir bolgesinde saglikli kan vericilerinde anti-HTLV-I/II seroprevalansinin arastirilmasi,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2010 Nov 10.,"This study examined the effect of IL-10 on immunoglobulin-like transcript (ILT4) expression of human monocytic leukemic cell line THP-1, especially the role of the ILT4 promoter activity. ILT4 promoter area was amplified by PCR, and was cloned into the eukaryotic expressing vector pGL3-Basic. The pGL3-ILTP obtained was tested by double endonuclease digestion and sequencing. Then, the recombinant plasmid was transfected into THP-1 cells by using lipofectamine. After culture with IL-10 for 12 h, the mRNA extracted from THP-1 cells was detected by RT-PCR and the protein was detected by FACS. The dual-luciferase reporter assay system was employed to detect the activity of ILT4 promoter with or without IL-10. The results showed that the activity of pGL3-ILTP was significantly increased and was more than ten times that of pGL3-Basic cells. After culture with IL-10 for 12 h, the expression of ILT4 protein and its mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) were increased. Moreover, the mRNA was remarkably higher than that of the control group. Dual-luciferase reporter assay revealed that ILT4 promoter was much more activated after being treated with IL-10. We were led to conclude that pGL3-ILTP containing ILT4 promoter was constructed successfully. The expression of ILT4 could be up-regulated by IL-10 both at the transcriptional and translational level. Furthermore, ILT4 promoter could be much more active after addition of IL-10. This study suggests that IL-10 up-regulates ILT4 expression on monocytes via increasing ILT4 gene promoter activity, which may have implication for inducing transplantation tolerance in clinical practice.","['Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China. ysxiaoli@yahoo.com.cn']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: Fifty-five patients were admitted a total of 66 times to the ICU during the study period. The mortality rate of this group was 23% compared with an overall ICU mortality rate of 5%. 11/15 patients who died had an underlying haematological malignancy. Twenty-eight percent of children with organism-identified sepsis died. CONCLUSIONS: While mortality rates for paediatric oncology patients admitted to a ICU have improved, they are still substantial.

METHODS: Data from the population-based Australian Paediatric Cancer Registry were used to describe relative survival outcomes using the period method for 11,903 children diagnosed with cancer between 1983 and 2006 and prevalent at any time between 1997 and 2006. RESULTS: The overall relative survival was 90.4% after 1 year, 79.5% after 5 years and 74.7% after 20 years. Where information onstage at diagnosis was available (lymphomas, neuroblastoma, renal tumours and rhabdomyosarcomas), survival was significantly poorer for more-advanced stage. Survival was lower among infants compared with other children for those diagnosed with leukaemia, tumours of the central nervous system and renal tumours but higher for neuroblastoma. Recent improvements in overall childhood cancer survival over time are mainly because of improvements among leukaemia patients. CONCLUSION: The high and improving survival prognosis for children diagnosed with cancer in Australia is consistent with various international estimates. However, a 5-year survival estimate of 79% still means that many children who are diagnosed with cancer will die within 5 years, whereas others have long-term health morbidities and complications associated with their treatments. It is hoped that continued developments in treatment protocols will result in further improvements in survival.","['[1] Viertel Centre for Research in Cancer Control, Cancer Council Queensland, 553 Gregory Terrace, GPO Box 201 Spring Hill, Fortitude Valley QLD 4006, Australia. peterbaade@cancerqld.org.au']",,PMC2994235,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2010 Oct 29.,"Genotoxic stress induces cell cycle arrest and DNA repair which may enable tumor cells to survive radiation therapy. Here, we defined the role of Ca(2+) signaling in the cell cycle control and survival of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cells subjected to ionizing radiation (IR). To this end, K562 erythroid leukemia cells were irradiated (0-10 Gy). Tumor survival was analyzed by clonogenic survival assay and cell cycle progression via flow cytometry. Plasma membrane cation conductance was assessed by patch-clamp whole-cell recording and the cytosolic free Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) was measured by fura-2 Ca(2+) imaging. Nuclear activity of Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) was defined by Western blotting. In addition, the effect of IR (5 Gy) on the cation conductance of primary CML cells was determined. The results indicated that IR (10 Gy) induced a G(2)/M cell cycle arrest of K562 cells within 24 h post-irradiation (p.i.) and decreased the clonogenic survival to 0.5 % of that of the control cells. In K562 cells, G(2)/M cell cycle arrest was preceded by activation of TRPV5/6-like nonselective cation channels in the plasma membrane 1-5 h p.i., resulting in an elevated Ca(2+) entry as evident from fura-2 Ca(2+) imaging. Similarly, IR stimulated a Ca(2+)-permeable nonselective cation conductance in primary CML cells within 2-4 h p.i.. Ca(2+) entry, into K562 cells was paralleled by an IR-induced activation of nuclear CaMKII. The IR-stimulated accumulation in G(2) phase was delayed upon buffering [Ca(2+)](i) with the Ca(2+) chelator BAPTA-AM or inhibiting CaMKII with KN93 (1 nM). In addition, KN93 decreased the clonogenic survival of irradiated cells but not of control cells. In conclusion, the data suggest that IR-stimulated cation channel activation, Ca(2+) entry and CaMKII activity participate in control of cell cycle progression and survival of irradiated CML cells.","['Department of Physiology, University of Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.']",,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2010 S.

Epub 2010 Nov 9.,"Adoptive transfer (AT) of T cells forced to express tumor-reactive T-cell receptor (TCR) genes is an attractive strategy to direct autologous T-cell immunity against tumor-associated antigens. However, clinical effectiveness has been hampered by limited in vivo persistence. We investigated whether the use of major histocompatibility complex-mismatched T cells would prolong the in vivo persistence of tumor-reactive TCR gene expressing T cells by continuous antigen-driven proliferation via the endogenous potentially alloreactive receptor. Donor-derived CD8(+) T cells engineered to express a TCR against a leukemia-associated antigen mediated strong graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effects with reduced graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) severity when given early after transplantation. AT later after transplantation resulted in a complete loss of GVL. Loss of function was associated with reduced expansion of TCR-transduced T cells as assessed by CDR3 spectratyping analysis and PD-1 up-regulation on T cells in leukemia-bearing recipients. PD-L1 blockade in allogeneic transplant recipients largely restored the GVL efficacy without triggering GVHD, whereas no significant antileukemia effects of PD-L1 blockade were observed in syngeneic controls. These data suggest a clinical approach in which the AT of gene-modified allogeneic T cells early after transplantation can provide a potent GVL effect without GVHD, whereas later AT is effective only with concurrent PD-L1 blockade.","['Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology and Blood Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.']","['P01 AI056299/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA065493/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA72669/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01AI 056299/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL056067/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA072669/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA142106/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3035065,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2010 Nov 9.,"Targeted drug delivery offers an opportunity for the development of safer and more effective therapies for the treatment of cancer. In this study, we sought to identify short, cell-internalizing peptide ligands that could serve as directive agents for specific drug delivery in hematologic malignancies. By screening of human leukemia cells with a combinatorial phage display peptide library, we isolated a peptide motif, sequence Phe-Phe/Tyr-Any-Leu-Arg-Ser (F(F)/(Y)XLRS), which bound to different leukemia cell lines and to patient-derived bone marrow samples. The motif was internalized through a receptor-mediated pathway, and we next identified the corresponding receptor as the transmembrane glycoprotein neuropilin-1 (NRP-1). Moreover, we observed a potent anti-leukemia cell effect when the targeting motif was synthesized in tandem to the pro-apoptotic sequence (D)(KLAKLAK)(2). Finally, our results confirmed increased expression of NRP-1 in representative human leukemia and lymphoma cell lines and in a panel of bone marrow specimens obtained from patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia or acute myelogenous leukemia compared with normal bone marrow. These results indicate that NRP-1 could potentially be used as a target for ligand-directed therapy in human leukemias and lymphomas and that the prototype CGFYWLRSC-GG-(D)(KLAKLAK)(2) is a promising drug candidate in this setting.","['David H.

Polymorphic peptides presented in HLA molecules, the so-called minor histocompatibility antigens (MiHA), play a crucial role in antitumor immunity as targets for alloreactive donor T cells. Identification of multiple MiHAs is essential to understand and manipulate the development of clinical responses after allo-SCT. In this study, CD8+ T-cell clones were isolated from leukemia patients who entered complete remission after allo-SCT, and MiHA-specific T-cell clones were efficiently selected for analysis of recognition of a panel of EBV-transformed B cells positive for the HLA restriction elements of the selected T-cell clones. One million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) were determined in the panel cell lines and investigated for matching with the T-cell recognition data by whole genome association scanning (WGAs). Significant association with 12 genomic regions was found, and detailed analysis of genes located within these genomic regions revealed SNP disparities encoding polymorphic peptides in 10 cases. Differential recognition of patient-type, but not donor-type, peptides validated the identification of these MiHAs. Using tetramers, distinct populations of MiHA-specific CD8+ T cells were detected, demonstrating that our WGAs strategy allows high-throughput discovery of relevant targets in antitumor immunity after allo-SCT.","['Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, the Netherlands. c.a.m.van_bergen@lumc.nl']",,,,,['Copyright (c) 2010 AACR.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CLL cells resistant to DNA damage-induced apoptosis display deregulation of a specific set of genes. METHODS: Microarray hybridization (Human GeneChip, Affymetrix), immunofluorescent in situ labeling coupled with video-microscopy recording/analyses, chromatin-immunoprecipitation (ChIP), polymerase chain reactions (PCR), real-time quantitative PCR (RT-QPCR) and bisulfite genome sequencing were the main methods applied. Statistical analyses were performed by applying GCRMA and SAM analysis (microarray data) and Student's t-test or Mann & Whitney's U-test. RESULTS: Herein we show that, remarkably, in a resistant male CLL cells the vast majority of genes were down-regulated compared with sensitive cells, whereas this was not the case in cells derived from females. This gene down-regulation was found to be associated with an overall gain of heterochromatin as evidenced by immunofluorescent labeling of heterochromatin protein 1alpha (HP-1), trimethylated histone 3 lysine 9 (3metH3K9), and 5-methylcytidine (5metC). Notably, 17 genes were found to be commonly deregulated in resistant male and female cell samples. Among these, RELB was identified as a discriminatory candidate gene repressed in the male and upregulated in the female resistant cells. CONCLUSION: The molecular defects in the silencing of RELB involve an increase in H3K9- but not CpG-island methylation in the promoter regions. Increase in acetyl-H3 in resistant female but not male CLL samples as well as a decrease of total cellular level of RelB after an inhibition of histone deacetylase (HDAC) by trichostatin A (TSA), further emphasize the role of epigenetic modifications which could discriminate two CLL subsets. Together, these results highlighted the epigenetic RELB silencing as a new marker of the progressive disease in males.","['Institut de Radiobiologie Cellulaire et Moleculaire, France.']",,PMC2994775,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its common occurrence in dogs suggests predisposing factors favor its development in this species. These factors could represent a constellation of heritable characteristics that promote transformation events and/or facilitate the establishment of a microenvironment that is conducive for survival of malignant blood vessel-forming cells. The hypothesis for this study was that characteristic molecular features distinguish hemangiosarcoma from non-malignant endothelial cells, and that such features are informative for the etiology of this disease. METHODS: We first investigated mutations of VHL and Ras family genes that might drive hemangiosarcoma by sequencing tumor DNA and mRNA (cDNA). Protein expression was examined using immunostaining. Next, we evaluated genome-wide gene expression profiling using the Affymetrix Canine 2.0 platform as a global approach to test the hypothesis. Data were evaluated using routine bioinformatics and validation was done using quantitative real time RT-PCR. RESULTS: Each of 10 tumor and four non-tumor samples analyzed had wild type sequences for these genes. At the genome wide level, hemangiosarcoma cells clustered separately from non-malignant endothelial cells based on a robust signature that included genes involved in inflammation, angiogenesis, adhesion, invasion, metabolism, cell cycle, signaling, and patterning. This signature did not simply reflect a cancer-associated angiogenic phenotype, as it also distinguished hemangiosarcoma from non-endothelial, moderately to highly angiogenic bone marrow-derived tumors (lymphoma, leukemia, osteosarcoma). CONCLUSIONS: The data show that inflammation and angiogenesis are important processes in the pathogenesis of vascular tumors, but a definitive ontogeny of the cells that give rise to these tumors remains to be established. The data do not yet distinguish whether functional or ontogenetic plasticity creates this phenotype, although they suggest that cells which give rise to hemangiosarcoma modulate their microenvironment to promote tumor growth and survival. We propose that the frequent occurrence of canine hemangiosarcoma in defined dog breeds, as well as its similarity to homologous tumors in humans, offers unique models to solve the dilemma of stem cell plasticity and whether angiogenic endothelial cells and hematopoietic cells originate from a single cell or from distinct progenitor cells.","['Integrated Department of Immunology, University of Colorado, Denver, School of Medicine, Denver, CO, USA.']","['P30 CA046934/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA077598/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 AI007405/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 RR018719/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2994824,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By breaking down ECM, MMPs may remove physical barriers, thus allowing cells to migrate and potentially invade other tissues. Recent evidence, however, shows that the proteolytic activities of MMPs also affect several fundamental physiological processes. Primary human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells often show constitutive release of several MMPs and chemokines, and there seems to be a crosstalk between the MMP system and the chemokine network. Firstly, the nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) system represents a common regulator at the transcriptional level both for MMPs (e.g. MMP-1 and MMP-9) and for the constitutive release of several chemokines (CCL2-4/CXCL1/8) by primary human AML cells. Secondly, the crosstalk at the molecular level probably includes MMP-mediated structural alteration and activation of constitutively released chemokines involved in AML cell migration (e.g. CXCL12) and stimulation of bone marrow angiogenesis (e.g. CXCL8). Thirdly, at a functional level the two systems interact because the chemokine network plays a role in similar physiological processes as the MMPs, including AML cell proliferation and migration and local regulation of angiogenesis. Both the chemokine system and MMPs are currently being evaluated as targets in anti-angiogenesis/cancer therapy and may also have potential therapeutic implications in AML. This review introduces the different members of the MMP family and describes their interactions with the chemokine network and the possible involvement of MMPs together with chemokines in leukemogenesis and chemosensitivity in AML.","['Department of Medicine, Haukeland University Hospital, N-5021 Bergen, Norway. mmakh@med.uib.no']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All four are clonal diseases of the haematopoietic stem or precursor cell, they are of a chronic nature and potentially aggravate to myelofibrosis or transform into acute leukaemia. Several strategies are pursued in the treatment of MPN. On the one hand, targeted therapies such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors (imatinib, dasatinib, nilotinib) and JAK2-inhibitors are adopted in MPN as well as rather unspecific treatment with interferon-alpha and with the newer group of immunomodulatory drugs (IMIDs). On the other hand, cellular immunotherapeutical options as allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) are exerted in patients with MPN. Evidence resulting from graft-versus-leukaemia (GvL) effect was the key to develop more specific immunotherapies for patients with haematologic malignancies. In this context, CML is a model for immunotherapeutic approaches, and therefore, vaccination trials using peptides derived from leukaemia-associated antigens (LAAs) to stimulate specific T cells are currently under investigation. But also in BCR-ABL-negative MPNs, antigens have been identified and immunomodulatory treatment strategies have been performed.

Although efforts to map the genetic lesions to single genes resulted in the discovery of defects in the TET2 and CBL genes, most of the target genes comprised in the chromosomal lesions still remain to be identified. In this review, the different genetic defects found in MPN and their relationships to each other and to disease pathogenesis are critically evaluated. At present, most of the evidence points to a random acquisition of phenotypic and non phenotypic mutations contributing to clonal heterogeneity in MPN. The origin of genetic instability in context of hereditary factors and the common JAK2 haplotype predisposing for the disease are discussed. Furthermore, we address how the choice of therapeutic approaches could be influenced by the genetic complexity.","['Center for Molecular Medicine, Austrian Academy of Sciences, Vienna, Austria.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Apart from its diagnostic importance in CML patients BCR-ABL1 it is a potent oncogene. The natural evolution of CML is to progress into accelerated phase and blast crisis after a rather indolent chronic phase. Clinical experience shows that long term remissions can be achieved at a high rate at least in chronic phase by specific inhibition of BCR-ABL1. This underlines the importance of BCR-ABL1 at this stage of the disease. However, in accelerated phase and blast crisis the effect of these substances is of inferior importance as relapses are the rule rather than the exception. Treatment failure in advanced disease is frequent in patients without detectable resistance mechanisms such as BCR-ABL1-mutations, which suggests that the previously BCR-ABL1 dependent pathways probably become autonomous. Such pathways include signal transduction as well as DNA damage surveillance and repair. Especially the latter appear to be crucial for disease progression by causing genetic instability, accumulation of mutations and additional chromosomal alterations leading to the loss of tumor suppressors. How is BCR-ABL1 organized on the genetic level, is there a genetic precursor lesion as discussed for Philadelphia-negative myeloproliferative diseases, what is its role in pathogenesis and progression of CML and what is its role in the CML-stem cell?

Although the stem cell hypothesis may apply to all neoplasms, leukemia-initiating cells have so far only been characterized in some detail in advanced acute (AML) and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). An intriguing observation is that although expressing various targets, LSC often remain unresponsive against most drugs, presumably because of 'intrinsic' resistance. Moreover, LSC represent heterogeneous populations of cells, grow in separate subclones, and acquire numerous defects, which points to substantial genetic instability and stem cell plasticity. The situation is complicated by the fact that stem cell evolution is a step-wise process with variable latency periods, so that many LSC-derived subclones remain small (undetectable) at diagnosis, but later, during therapy, may expand to a dominant clone and clinically overt relapsing disease. Finally the interaction between LSC and the microenvironment may contribute to stem cell function and LSC resistance.

Recently, the description of the gain-of-function mutation of JAK2 (JAK2V617F) has been identified in classical Philadelphia (Ph)-negative MPN, thus providing a rational target for novel innovative treatment strategies. In addition, molecular characterization of atypical Ph-negative MPN (e.g. the KITD816V mutation in mastocytosis and PDGF-receptor rearrangements in hypereosinophilic syndromes/chronic eosinophilic leukemia) complement the molecular knowledge of this heterogeneous disease family. Currently, clinical studies testing various JAK2-inhibitors in PV, ET as well as in primary and secondary myelofibrosis (MF) are under way. Interestingly, first data indicate that despite marked clinical activity in terms of spleen size reduction and improvement of constitutional symptoms, these inhibitors might not sufficiently reduce disease burden. Thus, alternative and well established treatment strategies, such as inhibition of thrombocyte aggregation by low dose aspirin, cytotoxics (e.g. hydroxyurea), immuno- and stroma-modifying therapy with interferon, tyrosine kinase inhibitors and, in selected cases, allogeneic stem cell transplantation are still important treatment options for patients suffering from MPN, which will be discussed in detail in this review.","['Internal Medicine V, Hematology and Oncology, Tyrolean Cancer Research Center, Innsbruck Medical University, Austria. dominik.wolf@i-med.ac.at']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2010 Nov 9.,"OBJECTIVE: To compare healthcare resource utilization, costs, and treatment adherence associated with dasatinib versus nilotinib treatment as second-line therapies in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients. METHODS: Two large retrospective claims databases (01/1999-06/2009) were combined to identify CML patients (ICD-9 code 205.1x) who received one or more prescriptions of dasatinib or nilotinib. Studied patients had continuous enrollment >/= 1 month prior to and after the index date, defined as the first prescription for dasatinib or nilotinib. Patients were followed for up to 6 months from the index date to the earliest of the termination of healthcare plan enrollment or end of data availability. Patients with bone marrow or stem cell transplant during the study period were excluded. Poisson regression models were used to compare healthcare resource utilization between the two groups. Results were reported as incidence rate ratios (IRR). Healthcare cost differences were estimated for each cost component using generalized linear models or two-part models. Treatment adherence was measured by the proportion of days covered (PDC) and compared using generalized linear models. Multivariate regressions were used to control for potential confounding factors. RESULTS: A total of 521 CML patients receiving second-line tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) (452 dasatinib and 69 nilotinib) were studied. During the study period, dasatinib patients were estimated to have more than twice as many inpatient days (IRR = 2.44; p < 0.001) and nearly double the number of inpatient admissions (IRR = 1.99; p = 0.047) compared to nilotinib patients. Over the follow-up period, dasatinib patients incurred $8828 more in total medical service costs (p < 0.001); cost differences were mainly driven by an adjusted inpatient cost difference of $8520 (p = 0.003). Dasatinib patients were less adherent, with a PDC value approximately 13% lower compared to nilotinib patients (p = 0.009). CONCLUSIONS: Among CML patients treated with second-line TKIs, nilotinib patients were more adherent and experienced lower healthcare resource utilization, resulting in medical service cost savings compared to dasatinib patients.","['Analysis Group, Inc., Boston, Massachusetts, USA. ewu@analysisgroup.com']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its hematologic and cytogenetic effects have been evaluated in a series of clinical trials. The aim of this study was to report hematologic and cytogenetic response in CML patients during the treatment with imatinib mesylate. METHODS: A total of 21 patients were treated and observed from July 2006 to December 2008. The median time from CML diagnosis was no more than 12 months, so all the patients received previous treatment with hydroxyurea for which the median time was 3 months. The patients received imatinib mesylate in an effective oral dose of 400 to 800 mg daily, which was followed with peripheral blood counts, bone marrow examination, and cytogenetic studies at 6, 12, 18 and 24 months. RESULTS: Complete hematologic responses were reported for 19 (90.48%) of 21 patients studied. Among 19 patients who had a response, 16 (86%) did so within 3 months. The best cytogenetic response rate at any time during the study treatment with imatinib mesylate, among 14 patients in which cytogenetic response evaluated was: complete cytogenetic response in 7 (50%) patients, partial cytogenetic response in 6 (42.9%) patients and minor cytogenetic response in 1 (7.1%) patient. No patients had progressed to accelerated or blastic phase. The most frequent adverse effects that seemed to be related to treatment with imatinib mesylate were edema and musculoskeletal pain; overall, most were mild. Only one patient discontinued treatment because of hematologic toxic effects. CONCLUSION: The results obtained in this study confirm that imatinib mesylate induces a complete hematological and cytogenetic response in a high percentage of patients with chronic-phase CML.","['Clinical Center Nis, Clinic of Haematology and Clinical Immunology, Nis, Serbia. icojbasic@gmail.com']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The plant kingdom is a relatively underexploited cache of novel drugs, and crude extracts of plants are known for their synergistic activity. The present study assessed the anti-proliferative activity of the medicinal plant Centrosema pubescens Benth. Centrosema pubescens dichloromethane extract (CPDE) inhibited the proliferation of HL-60 (promyelocytic acute leukaemia) cells with an IC(5)(0) value of 5 mug/ml. Further studies also showed that CPDE induces growth arrest at the G1 phase and specifically down-regulates the expressions of cyclin E and CDK2 and up-regulates p27(CKI) levels. These events apparently lead to the induction of apoptosis, which was demonstrated qualitatively by a DNA fragmentation assay and propidium iodide staining. Quantitative assessment of the effective arrest of the cell cycle and of apoptosis was confirmed by flow cytometry. CPDE exhibited negligible cytotoxicity even at the highest dose tested (100 mug/ml) in both normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells and in an in vitro model (HL-60). Our results strongly suggest that CPDE arrests the cell cycle at the G1 phase and triggers apoptosis by caspase activation.","['Centre for Biotechnology, Anna University, Chennai, India.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We analyzed the function of components of a complex containing master regulators of hematopoiesis (GATA-1 and Scl/TAL1) and the non-DNA binding components ETO2, the LIM domain protein LMO2, and the chromatin looping factor LDB1. Surprisingly, we discovered that ETO2 and LMO2 regulate distinct target-gene ensembles in erythroid cells. ETO2 commonly repressed GATA-1 function via suppressing histone H3 acetylation, although it also regulated methylation of histone H3 at lysine 27 at select loci. Prior studies defined multiple modes by which GATA-1 regulates target genes with or without the coregulator Friend of GATA-1 (FOG-1). LMO2 selectively repressed genes that GATA-1 represses in a FOG-1-independent manner. As LMO2 controls hematopoiesis, its dysregulation is leukemogenic, and its influence on GATA factor function is unknown, this mechanistic link has important biological and pathophysiological implications. The demonstration that ETO2 and LMO2 exert qualitatively distinct functions at endogenous loci illustrates how components of complexes containing master developmental regulators can impart the capacity to regulate unique cohorts of target genes, thereby diversifying complex function.","['Wisconsin Institutes for Medical Research, University of Wisconsin Carbone Cancer Center, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, WI 53705, USA.']","['DK68634/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK050107/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK50107/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK068634/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 DK050107/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R56 DK068634/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2996669,,,,['GEO/GSE24359'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To comprehensively study the relationship between genetic variation within the 4.5 Mb major histocompatibility complex genomic region and precursor B-cell (BCP) ALL risk, we analyzed 1075 observed and 8176 imputed single nucleotide polymorphisms and their related haplotypes in 824 BCP-ALL cases and 4737 controls. Using these genotypes we also imputed both common and rare alleles at class I (HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C) and class II (HLA-DRB1, HLA-DQA1, and HLA-DQB1) HLA loci. Overall, we found no statistically significant association between variants and BCP-ALL risk.

It has been hypothesized that gain of the MYC protooncogene is of central importance in trisomy 8, but the experimental data to support this are limited and controversial. In a mouse model of promyelocytic leukemia in which the MRP8 promoter drives expression of the PML-RARA fusion gene in myeloid cells, a Myc allele is gained in approximately two-thirds of cases as a result of trisomy for mouse chromosome 15. We used this model to test the idea that MYC underlies acquisition of trisomy in AML. We used a retroviral vector to drive expression of wild-type, hypermorphic, or hypomorphic MYC in bone marrow that expressed the PML-RARA transgene. MYC retroviruses cooperated in myeloid leukemogenesis and suppressed gain of chromosome 15. When the PML-RARA transgene was expressed in a Myc haploinsufficient background, we observed selection for increased copies of the wild-type Myc allele concomitant with leukemic transformation. In addition, we found that human myeloid leukemias with trisomy 8 have increased MYC. These data show that gain of MYC can contribute to the pathogenic effect of the most common trisomy of human AML.","['Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center and Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA 94143, USA.']","['R01 CA095274/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA95274/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA072614/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA095274-07/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 CA084221/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA84221/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2989761,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Such a trend has never been substantiated in the Arab world. OBJECTIVE: Examine the frequency, types, modes, and reasons of CAM use among pediatric leukemia patients in Lebanon. METHODS: A cross-sectional design was utilized to survey (by phone) the caregivers of all pediatric leukemia patients on the rosters of the 2 largest cancer treatment facilities in Lebanon for years 2005-2009. A total of 125 parents out of 175 (71.4%) completed the questionnaire, which included 3 sections: socio-demographic characteristics, clinical information and CAM use details. Data analysis employed univariate descriptive statistics, t-test, and chi(2) RESULTS: Overall, 15.2% of respondents reported using one or more CAM therapies for their child (95% confidence interval: 8.9% to 22.0%). The main CAM therapies used included dietary supplements, prayer/spiritual healing, and unconventional cultural practices (ingesting bone ashes). CAM therapies were used for strengthening immunity (42.1%) and improving the chance of cure (21%). Pediatric users of CAM were 2 years older than nonusers and had been diagnosed with leukemia for a longer period of time (4.76 +/- 3.24 vs 3.49 +/- 2.38, P<.05). The percentage of males among CAM users was higher than that among nonusers (89.5% vs 56.6%, P<.05). CONCLUSION: Increasing awareness of both caretakers and physicians of pediatric leukemia patients on the effects and risks of CAM therapies is essential should rational, safe, and evidence-based utilization of CAM therapies be achieved.","['American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon.']",,,,,['(c) The Author(s) 2011'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2010 Dec 22.,"The Philadelphia chromosome-negative (Ph-) chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms include the three well-known clinical entities polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET), and primary myelofibrosis (PMF). Over time, patients with ET and PV may develop myelofibrosis (MF), and all three entities carry a risk of transformation into acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In a population-based survey during 1983-1999, we studied a total of 358 patients who were diagnosed with ET and PV in the city of Gothenburg, Sweden. At the time of diagnosis, evaluable bone marrow biopsy material was available from 280 of these patients. The current work was aimed at investigating the impact of peripheral blood counts, spleen size, and bone marrow biopsy findings at diagnosis on long-term survival and the risk of development of AML or MF in this well-defined unselected population. The variables evaluated were venous blood hemoglobin concentration, packed cell volume, white blood cell count, platelet count, and splenic enlargement; as to bone marrow biopsies, interest was focused on reticulin content, focal or generalized collagen formation, bone marrow cellularity, and megakaryocyte profile number. Over the median observation time of 15 yr, the patients with ET did not demonstrate any significant difference as to survival compared to the normal Swedish population (hazard ratio, 1.23; 95% confidence interval, 0.97-1.51; p= 0.089). The patients with PV, on the other hand, had a significantly shorter survival compared to general population (hazard ratio, 1.66; 95% confidence interval, 1.38-1.99; p< 0.001). A lower hemoglobin concentration at diagnosis of ET predicted poorer survival (p =0.0281), whereas patients with PV with splenic enlargement at diagnosis had a shorter survival (p =0.037). In the patients with ET, the risk of transformation to either MF or AML was significantly associated with low hemoglobin concentration and high white cell count at diagnosis (p =0.0037 and 0.0306, respectively). An increased reticulin content and hypercellularity in the bone marrow at diagnosis were also independent risk factors (p =0.0359 and 0.0103, respectively). The risk of transformation in patients with PV was significantly associated with splenic enlargement and increase in bone marrow reticulin content (p =0.0028 and 0.0164, respectively).","['Hematology and Coagulation Section, Department of Medicine, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Goteborg, Sweden.']",,,,,['(c) 2010 John Wiley & Sons A/S.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pediatric patients may develop lymphomas and acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), especially of the T-lineage. The prognosis of the malignancies is impaired by the immunodeficiency and the susceptibility to ionising radiation and chemotherapeutics. CASE REPORT: Here, we first report on a patient with AT and pre B-cell ALL. The therapy was administered according to the medium risk arm of the ALL-BFM 2000 study protocol of the German Society of Pediatric Oncology and Hematology. Doses primarily of all alkylating agents, anthracyclins and methotrexate were individually reduced. During reinduction, the patient suffered from a candida pneumonia and sepsis aggravated by a parainfectious encephalitis. Over 1 year after the end of the maintenance therapy the patient is still in complete first remission. CONCLUSION: A general recommendation for dose modification in these patients group cannot be made due to the low number of patients suffering from AT and leukaemia. Central registration of these rare patients will potentially facilitate to develop effective chemotherapeutic strategies with tolerable toxicity.","['Klinikum Dortmund gGmbH, Klinik fur Kinder- und Jugendmedizin, Beurhausstrasse 40, Dortmund, Germany. bastian.brummel@klinikumdo.de']",,,,,['(c) Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart .

The underlying molecular mechanisms that link cigarette smoke to cardiovascular disease remain unclear. The present study was designed to examine the effects of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)-soluble smoke particles (DSPs) on human aortic smooth muscle cell (HASMC) cultures, and to explore the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) signal mechanisms involved. Serum-starved HASMCs were treated with DSPs for up to 48 h. DSPs promoted cell proliferation in a concentration-dependent manner from 0.05 to 0.2 mul/ml. Activation of ERK1/2 and NF-kappaB was seen after exposure to DSPs. This occurred in parallel with the increase in cell population, bromodeoxyuridine incorporation, and cyclinD1/cyclin-dependent kinase 4 expression. Blocking phosphorylation of ERK1/2 by MAPK inhibitors U0126 and PD98059, and inhibiting activation of NF-kappaB by IkappaB (IkappaB) kinase inhibitors wedelolactone or IMD-0354, abolished the DSP effects. However, either a p38 inhibitor (SB203580) or an inhibitor of lipopolysaccharide (polymyxin B), or nicotinic receptor blockers (mecamylamine and alpha-bungarotoxin), did not inhibit a DSP-induced increase in the cell population. DSPs increased the expression of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 and the release of interleukin-6 in HASMCs, both of which were inhibited by ERK1/2 or NF-kappaB pathway inhibitors. Furthermore, cell apoptosis and necrosis were found in serum-starved HASMCs. DSPs decreased cell death and increased B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 expression. Blocking phosphorylation of ERK1/2 or NF-kappaB attenuated DSP-induced cell death inhibition. Cigarette smoke particles stimulate HASMC proliferation and inhibit cell death. The intracellular signal mechanisms behind this involve activation of ERK1/2 and NF-kappaB pathways.","['Division of Experimental Vascular Research, Institute of Clinical Science in Lund, Lund University, Lund, Sweden. qche0001@glo.regionh.dk']",,PMC5763733,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is one of the leukemia-associated antigens (LAA) identified in patients with myeloid leukemias. WE AIMED: at studying the frequency of expression of RHAMM/CD168 in Egyptian patients with CML, both in chronic phase and accelerated/blastic phase, as a potential target structure for cellular immunotherapies, and to compare it with available western records. PATIENTS AND METHODS: RHAMM expression was tested by RT-PCR in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 60 CML patients divided into 2 groups, group A: 44 chronic phase CML patients, group B: 16 accelerated/ blastic phase patients as well as 15 healthy volunteers. OUR RESULTS: Demonstrated that 14/44 (31.8%) of chronic CML patients showed positive RHAMM expression in contrast to 15/16 ( 93.7%) in the accelerated/blastic phase patients. Moreover within the chronic phase patients the RHAMM positive patients had a significantly higher level of bcr-abl/abl ratio. This highlighted the contribution of RHAMM expression with CML disease progression. CONCLUSION: Our work demonstrated a similar proportion of RHAMM expression in both Egyptian and western CML patients. This may pave the way for subsequent studies suggesting the concomitant use of RHAMM R3 peptide vaccination with conventional CML therapy especially in accelerated phase, in order to achieve complete molecular remission for our patient.","['The Department of Clinical & Chemical Pathology, Cairo University, Egypt. goudamed@hotmail.com']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We analyzed the registry data from 3559 patients with acute leukemia, CML and myelodysplastic syndrome who received T-cell replete unrelated BMT through the Japan Marrow Donor Program. Adjusted effects of cell dose were evaluated for various outcomes separately according to disease stages and children or adults. Acute GVHD and nonrelapse mortality were not affected by cell dose. Among children, a cell dose lower than 3.0 x 10(8)/kg was associated with lower engraftment rates in advanced-stage diseases. Among adults, a cell dose of 3.4 x 10(8)/kg or higher was associated with lower relapse rates and better survival rates only in early-stage diseases, whereas cell dose below 2.3 x 10(8)/kg was associated with lower engraftment rates in advanced-stage diseases. In conclusion, effects of cell dose may differ among disease stages. A cell dose of 3.4 x 10(8)/kg or higher is recommended only for adults with early-stage diseases. With the number of patients available for analysis in this study, we could not show any significant benefits associated with 4.6 x 10(8)/kg or higher in children.","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan. yinamoto@js3.so-net.ne.jp']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2010 Nov 8.,"The PML protein is best known for its role as a tumor suppressor for acute promyelocytic leukemia. Both PML and the key Wnt signaling regulator AXIN regulate p53-dependent apoptosis in response to DNA damage. However, how the two major tumor suppressors coordinate with each other is unknown, and the molecular components orchestrating the PML-induced apoptosis remain enigmatic. Here we show that AXIN interacts with PML in vivo, and further that AXIN, PML and p53 form a ternary complex. Exposure to genotoxic signals including UV and doxorubicin induces AXIN to enter into the nucleus where it colocalizes with PML in the nuclear bodies. Domain-mapping experiments revealed that the C-terminal region (aa 597-832) of AXIN is responsible for its interaction with PML. AXIN fails to activate p53 in PML(-/-) cells, and conversely, PML is unable to activate p53 in AXIN-null SNU475 cells. Consistently, knockdown with respective siRNAs revealed that AXIN and PML depend on each other to elevate p53-Ser-46 phosphorylation and to induce apoptosis after treatment with genotoxins. Moreover, we found that dominant-negative mutants of PML blocked AXIN-induced p53 activation, and that AXIN promotes PML sumoylation, a modification necessary for PML functions. Our finding has thus provided a new avenue for understanding the mechanism by which PML activates p53 and exerts its role as a tumor suppressor.","['Key Laboratory of Ministry of Education for Cell Biology and Tumor Cell Engineering, Fujian Laboratory for Cancer Biology, School of Life Sciences, Xiamen University, Fujian, China.']",,,,,['(c) 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2010 Nov 8.,"The most common translocation in childhood T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) involves the LMO2 locus, resulting in ectopic expression of the LMO2 gene in human thymocytes. The LMO2 gene was also activated in patients with X-linked Severe Combined Immune Deficiency treated with gene therapy because of retroviral insertion in the LMO2 locus. The LMO2 insertions predisposed these children to T-ALL, yet how LMO2 contributes to T cell transformation remains unclear. The LIM (Lin 11, Isl-1, Mec-3) domain containing LMO2 protein regulates erythropoiesis as part of a large transcriptional complex consisting of LMO2, TAL1, E47, GATA1 and LDB1 that recognizes bipartite E-box-GATA1 sites on target genes. Similarly, a TAL1/E47/LMO2/LDB1 complex is observed in human T-ALL and Tal1 and Lmo2 expression in mice results in disease acceleration. To address the mechanism(s) of Tal1/Lmo2 synergy in leukemia, we generated Lmo2 transgenic mice and mated them with mice that express wild-type Tal1 or a DNA-binding mutant of TAL1.

The gene encoding TET2 resides at chromosome 4q24, in a region showing recurrent microdeletions and copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity (CN-LOH) in patients with diverse myeloid malignancies. Somatic TET2 mutations are frequently observed in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), MDS/MPN overlap syndromes including chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML), acute myeloid leukaemias (AML) and secondary AML (sAML). We show here that TET2 mutations associated with myeloid malignancies compromise catalytic activity. Bone marrow samples from patients with TET2 mutations displayed uniformly low levels of 5hmC in genomic DNA compared to bone marrow samples from healthy controls. Moreover, small hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated depletion of Tet2 in mouse haematopoietic precursors skewed their differentiation towards monocyte/macrophage lineages in culture. There was no significant difference in DNA methylation between bone marrow samples from patients with high 5hmC versus healthy controls, but samples from patients with low 5hmC showed hypomethylation relative to controls at the majority of differentially methylated CpG sites. Our results demonstrate that Tet2 is important for normal myelopoiesis, and suggest that disruption of TET2 enzymatic activity favours myeloid tumorigenesis. Measurement of 5hmC levels in myeloid malignancies may prove valuable as a diagnostic and prognostic tool, to tailor therapies and assess responses to anticancer drugs.","[""Department of Pathology, Harvard Medical School, Immune Disease Institute and Program in Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Children's Hospital Boston, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA.""]","['1 UL1 RR 025758-02/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'K08 HL089150/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI044432/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HD065812/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'K24 HL077522/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'RC1 DA028422-01/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI044432-13/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL098522/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA042471-21/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI044432-12/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HG004069/HG/NHGRI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA042471-20/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA042471/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 RR025758/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI44432/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'RC1 DA028422/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HG4069/HG/NHGRI NIH HHS/United States', 'RC1 DA028422-02/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3003755,['NIHMS247005'],,,['GEO/GSE25706'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Prospective, interventional cohort study. SETTING: The medical intensive care unit of a tertiary, academic medical center. STUDY SUBJECTS: Patients with severe sepsis or septic shock consecutively treated in a medical intensive care unit. INTERVENTIONS: Daily auditing and weekly feedback, and sepsis response team activation. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: During a 33-month study period, from January 2007 through September 2009, we performed daily screening of patients for severe sepsis or septic shock. Study periods were divided into baseline (screening only), daily auditing with weekly feedback, and sepsis response team activation. Comparisons among the three periods were made by using univariate and multiple logistic regression analyses. Compliance with the overall sepsis resuscitation bundle and its individual elements and hospital mortality were used as outcome measures. A total of 984 episodes of severe sepsis and septic shock were identified during the study periods, severe sepsis in 52 (5.3%) and septic shock in 932 (94.7%). The compliance rate with all elements of the sepsis resuscitation bundle increased from 12.7% at baseline to 37.7% and 53.7% during the weekly feedback and sepsis response team activation periods, respectively (p < .001). Overall hospital mortality rate was 30.3%, 28.3%, and 22.0% during baseline, weekly feedback, and sepsis response team periods, respectively (p = .029). Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that the sepsis response team was associated with reduced risk of hospital death (odds ratio, 0.657; 95% confidence interval, 0.456-0.945; p = .023) whereas hepatic cirrhosis, hepatic failure, leukemia, multiple myeloma, transfer from the same hospital ward, do-not-resuscitate status at the recognition of severe sepsis/septic shock, and lactate level were associated with increased risk of death. CONCLUSIONS: In septic shock, the activation of the sepsis response team in combination with weekly feedback increases the compliance with the process of care and reduces hospital mortality rate.","['Hospital Pharmacy Services, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.']",['1 UL 1RR024150-01*/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,['Crit Care Med. 2011 Feb;39(2):394-6.

The aim of the present study was to determine patterns of tropism exhibited by pseudotyped lentiviral vectors in the rat substantia nigra, in order to evaluate their utility for gene transfer in experimental models of Parkinson's disease. Isogenic lentiviral vector particles encoding a GFP reporter were pseudotyped with envelope glycoproteins derived from vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), Mokola virus (MV), lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), or Moloney murine leukemia virus (MuLV). Adult male Lewis rats received unilateral stereotactic infusions of vector into the substantia nigra; three weeks later, patterns of viral transduction were determined by immunohistological detection of GFP. Different pseudotypes gave rise to transgene expression in restricted and distinct cellular populations. VSV and MV pseudotypes transduced midbrain neurons, including a subset of nigral dopaminergic neurons. In contrast, LCMV- and MuLV-pseudotyped lentivirus produced transgene expression exclusively in astrocytes; the restricted transduction of astroglial cells was not explained by the cellular distribution of receptors previously shown to mediate entry of LCMV or MuLV. These data suggest that pseudotyped lentiviral vectors will be useful for experimental gene transfer to the rat substantia nigra. In particular, the availability of neuronal and astrocytic-targeting vectors will allow dissociation of cell autonomous and cell non-autonomous functions of key gene products in vivo.","['Pittsburgh Institute for Neurodegenerative Diseases, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA 15260, USA.']","['I01 BX000548/BX/BLRD VA/United States', 'P01 NS059806/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 NS059806-02/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', '1P01NS059806/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3038546,['NIHMS251587'],,['Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2010 Nov 5.,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs that regulate target gene expression through translation repression or messenger RNA degradation. MiR-15a and 16-1 form a cluster at the chromosomal region 13q14, which is frequently deleted or down-regulated in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Arsenic trioxide (As(2)O(3), ATO) has been successfully applied to treat acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Its combination with other drugs presented therapeutic activities in hematologic and solid tumors. Here we investigated the potential synergy between miR-15a/16-1 and ATO on Bcr-Abl positive leukemic K562 cells. In this study, we found that combination of miR-15a/16-1 and ATO synergistically induced growth inhibition and apoptosis in K562 cells. The apoptosis, at least in part, through regulating mitochondrial function including the release of cytochrome c and loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential, also activation of caspase-3 and degradation of poly-adenosine diphosphate-ribose polymerase. However, the expression of Bcr-Abl was not affected by ATO and/or miR-15a/16-1. Moreover, apoptotic synergy between miR-15a/16-1 and ATO was observed in Bcr-Abl negative leukemic cell lines and primary leukemic cells. Taken together, these findings suggested that the combined regiment of miR-15a/16-1 and ATO might be a potential therapeutic remedy for the treatment of leukemia.","['Laboratory of Internal Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical College, Wenzhou, Zhejiang 325000, China.']",,,,,['Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Gain-of-function mutations in Shp2 indicate that it may serve as an oncogene in several types of human leukemia. Paradoxically, however, some catalytically dominant-negative mutations of Shp2 have also been identified in leukemia and neuroblastomas. In this study, we show that Shp2 suppresses transformation induced by PyMT, the major polyoma viral oncoprotein known to act through binding and activation of pp60(c-src). Over-expression of a catalytically inactive Shp2 mutant in NIH3T3 cells significantly enhanced PyMT-induced transformation. Conversely, re-introduction of Shp2 into Shp2-deficient cells strongly inhibited PyMT-induced transformation and tumorigenesis. Short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated Shp2 knockdown potentiated PyMT-induced transformation. Finally, we present evidence that the transformation-suppressive effects of Shp2 are mediated at least partially through the inhibition of signal transducers and activators of transcription 3.","['Laboratory of Vascular Biology, Institute of Molecular Medicine, Peking University, Beijing 100871, China. yingyang76@gmail.com']","['R01 CA092520/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA092520-10/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA-092520/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3008596,['NIHMS244803'],,['Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Together with the quantification of telomerase activity (TA), measuring telomere length (TL) and expression of the genes that govern telomere protection and elongation are useful for assessing telomere homeostasis. RESULTS: By these means we demonstrate that TL, hTERT, and TA are in the order acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) > T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) > B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) > T-ALL > AML, and B-ALL > AML > T-ALL. AML0 and AML3 display the lowest amounts of hTERT transcripts, and ALL and AML cells with cytogenetic abnormalities possess the shortest telomeres. hTERT expression includes phenotype-specific RNA maturation and correlates with TA but not with TL. A wide ratio of TA to hTERT expression between leukemia subtypes suggests phenotype-specific hTERT post-transcriptional deregulations.

Epub 2010 Nov 4.,"OBJECTIVE: The 67-kDa laminin receptor (LR) is a nonintegrin receptor for laminin, a major component of the extracellular matrix. To elucidate the role of LR in leukemia cells, we studied the relationship between the phenotype of leukemia cells and LR expression. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The relationship between clinical features of acute myeloid leukemia and expression of LR was examined. LR was overexpressed or suppressed by the introduction of complementary DNA or small interfering RNA for LR in a human leukemia cell line to test the effect of LR on the phenotype of leukemia. Expression of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptors (GM-CSFR) was also tested in leukemia cells, including clinical samples. RESULTS: Expression of LR was significantly related to elevation of white blood cell count, lactate dehydrogenase, and survival among acute myeloid leukemia patients. Forced expression of LR enhanced proliferation, cell-cycle progression, and antiapoptosis of leukemia cells associated with phosphorylation of a transcription factor, signal transducer and activator of transcription 5, in the absence of stimulation by laminin. On the other hand, suppression of LR expression had the opposite effects. The number of GM-CSFR increased in leukemia cells overexpressing LR, and there was a significant relationship between the expression of LR and GM-CSFR in acute myeloid leukemia samples. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that LR expression influenced the characteristics of leukemia cells toward an aggressive phenotype and increased the number of GM-CSFR. These changes might be partly related to enhanced GM-CSF signaling.","['Hematology and Molecular Medicine Unit, Atomic Bomb Disease Institute, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, 1-12-4 Sakamoto, Nagasaki, Japan.']",,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2011 ISEH - Society for Hematology and Stem Cells.

In the present study the growth inhibitory effect of propionyloxy derivative of 11-keto-beta-boswellic acid (PKBA; a semisynthetic analogue of 11-keto-beta-boswellic acid) on HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells is being reported for the first time. In the preliminary studies, in vitro cytotoxicity of PKBA was investigated against eight human cancer cell lines viz., IMR-32, SF-295 (both neuroblastoma), PC-3 (prostate), Colo-205 (colon), MCF-7 (breast), OVCAR-5 (ovary), HL-60, Molt-4 (both leukemia) and their respective IC(50) values were found to be 5.95, 7.11, 15.2, 14.5, 15, 15.9, 8.7 & 9.5mug/ml, respectively. For determining the mechanism of cell death in HL-60 cells, PKBA was subjected to different mechanistic studies. DNA relaxation assay of PKBA revealed inhibition of both topoisomerases I & II. The fragmentation analysis of DNA revealed typical ladders indicating the cytotoxic effect to be mediated by induction of apoptosis. The morphologic studies of PKBA showed the presence of true apoptotic bodies. Apoptosis was confirmed further by flow-cytometric detection of sub-G(1) peaks and enhanced annexin-V-FITC binding of the cells. The activation of apoptotic cascade by PKBA in HL-60 cells was found to be associated with the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, release of cytochrome c, activation of initiator and executioner caspases and cleavage of poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP). In vivo studies of PKBA revealed anti-tumoral activity against both ascitic and solid murine tumor models. These studies thus demonstrate PKBA to induce apoptosis in HL-60 cells due to the inhibition of topoisomerases I and II.","['Pharmacology Division, Indian Institute of Integrative Medicine, Canal Road, Jammu tawi, Jammu and Kashmir, India.']",,,,,['Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

METHODS: 128 cases of T-LBL/ALL were analyzed for the clinical features, morphology, immunophenotype and TCR gene rearrangement using routine eosin and haematoxylin stain, immunohistochemistry and polymerase chain reaction combining with the clinical findings. RESULTS: In 128 cases of T-LBL/ALL, there were 94 male and 34 female. The ratio of male/female was 2.8:1. The age of patients ranged from 4 to 88 years, with an average of 27 years and a median of 22 years. Lymph nodes and extranodal areas were involved in 58/128 and 27/128 cases of T-LBL/ALL, respectively. The other 43 cases had involvement of both nodal and extranodal areas. Cervical node and mediastinum were involved in 74 cases and 43 cases, respectively. Diffuse growth pattern of tumor cells was predominant. Nodular growth pattern was seen only in a few cases. Most cases composed of small to medium-sized lymphoblasts, and other 7 cases showed a composition of large lymphoblasts. Tumor cells expressed TdT in 121/128 (94.5%) cases, CD34 in 48/98 (49.0%) cases, CD3 in 78/108 (72.2%) cases, CD7 in 104/108 (96.3%) cases, CD43 in 56/63 (88.9%) cases, CD79a in 5/70 (7.1%) cases, CD10 in 25/76 (32.9%) cases, CD99 in 58/60 (96.7%) cases and Pax-5 in 4/91(4.4%) cases. All of the cases were negative for MPO. A follow up data, ranging from 1 to 53 months, was obtained in 51/128 (39.8%) patients. The over all survival rate was 68.6% and the median survival time was 12 months. Under a similar condition of carrying a positive staining result on CD3 in tumor cells, there was a statistically significant difference between patients in the group of over 30 of age and that with the age ranging from 11 to 30. Patients associating with a CD10 positive staining of tumor cells showed also a shorter survival period. In addition, there were 4 out of 5 cases showing the presence of TCR gene rearrangement. CONCLUSIONS: T-LBL/ALL are aggressive in behavior, associating mainly with enlarged cervical lymph nodes and masses in the mediastinum, occurring predominantly in children and young adults. Although small to medium-sized tumor cells with diffuse pattern were found in most cases, however, large-sized tumor cells and nodular pattern could also be obtained in a few cases. Immunohistochemistry staining particularly adoption of CD7, Pax-5, TdT, CD34 and Ki-67 stainings in combination are helpful of making a diagnosis for T-LBL/ALL. Analysis of TCR gene rearrangement will be helpful for the diagnosis of a few difficult cases.","['Department of Pathology, Beijing Friendship Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing 100050, China.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Histochemical (for PAS and GMS) and immunohistochemical (for MUC5B) studies were carried out. Fungal culture results were available in 13 of the 21 cases. RESULTS: The age of the patients ranged from 12 to 72 years (median = 48 years). The male-to-female ratio was 17:4. Eight cases (38.1%) were complicated by invasive fungal sinusitis, with orbital involvement in 6 cases and brain involvement in 1 case. The primary tumors in such cases included leukemia (n = 7) and nasopharyngeal carcinoma (n = 1). The fungi belonged to Zygomycete in 5 cases and Aspergillus in 3 cases. These patients had history of chemotherapy/radiotherapy or antibiotics usage. The remaining 13 cases of fungal infection often affected necrotic tumor tissue in nasal cavity, paranasal sinuses, pharynx, larynx and palate. The fungi involved were Aspergillus (n = 6) and Candida (n = 4). Seven of such patients had received radiotherapy. Fungal culture was positive in 9 cases. Fourteen patients had follow-up information available and six of them died of the disease. CONCLUSIONS: Malignant tumors occurring in head and neck region can be complicated by fungal infection. Invasive fungal sinusitis (due to Zygomycetes and Aspergillus) often occurs in patients with leukemia, tends to involve orbit and is associated with poor prognosis. On the other hand, Aspergillus and Candida are the commonest fungi found in the necrotic tumor tissue. Pathologic examination remains the hallmark in confirming the diagnosis and fungal typing.","['Department of Pathology, Beijing Tongren Hospital, Capital Medical University, China.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we evaluated the quantitative defects of newly produced B and T lymphocytes. METHODS: The output of B and T lymphocytes from the production and maturation sites was analyzed in chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients and healthy controls by quantifying kappa-deleting recombination excision circles (KRECs) and T-cell receptor excision circles (TRECs) by a Real-Time PCR assay that simultaneously detects both targets. T-lymphocyte subsets were analyzed by six-color flow cytometric analysis. Data comparison was performed by two-sided Mann-Whitney test. RESULTS: KRECs level was reduced in untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients studied at the very early stage of the disease, whereas the release of TRECs+ cells was preserved. Furthermore, the observed increase of CD4+ lymphocytes could be ascribed to the accumulation of CD4+ cells with effector memory phenotype. CONCLUSIONS: The decreased number of newly produced B lymphocytes in these patients is likely related to a homeostatic mechanism by which the immune system balances the abnormal B-cell expansion. This feature may precede the profound defect of humoral immunity characterizing the later stages of the disease.","['Department of Hematology, Spedali Civili, Piazzale Spedali Civili 1, 25123, Brescia, Italy.']",,PMC2991330,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The neurovirulence of this virus has been genetically mapped to the surface expressed subunit (SU) of the env gene. However, CasBrE SU synthesized in the absence of the transmembrane subunit (TM) does not retain ecotropic receptor binding activity, indicating that folding of the receptor binding domain (RBD) requires this domain. Using a neural stem cell (NSC) based viral trans complementation approach to examine whether misfolded CasBrE SU retained neurovirulence, we observed CasBrE SU interaction with the ""non-neurovirulent"" amphotropic helper virus, 4070A which restored functional activity of CasBrE SU. RESULTS: Herein, we show that infection of NSCs expressing CasBrE SU with 4070A (CasES+4070A-NSCs) resulted in the redistribution of CasBrE SU from a strictly secreted product to include retention on the plasma membrane. Cell surface cross-linking analysis suggested that CasBrE SU membrane localization was due to interactions with 4070A Env. Viral particles produced from CasES+4070A-NSCS contained both CasBrE and 4070A gp70 Env proteins. These particles displayed ecotropic receptor-mediated infection, but were still 100-fold less efficient than CasE+4070A-NSC virus. Infectious center analysis showed CasBrE SU ecotropic transduction efficiencies approaching those of NSCs expressing full length CasBrE Env (CasE; SU+TM). In addition, CasBrE SU-4070A Env interactions resulted in robust ecotropic superinfection interference indicating near native intracellular SU interaction with its receptor, mCAT-1. CONCLUSIONS: In this report we provided evidence that 4070A Env and CasBrE SU physically interact within NSCs leading to CasBrE SU retention on the plasma membrane, incorporation into viral particles, restoration of mCAT-1 binding, and capacity for initiation of TM-mediated fusion events. Thus, heterotropic Env-SU interactions facilitates CasBrE SU folding events that restore Env activity. These findings are consistent with the idea that one protein conformation acts as a folding scaffold or nucleus for a second protein of similar primary structure, a process reminiscent of prion formation. The implication is that template-based protein folding may represent an inherent feature of neuropathogenic proteins that extends to retroviral Envs.","['Department of Integrative Medical Sciences, Northeastern Ohio Universities College of Medicine, 4209 State Route 44, Rootstown, Ohio 44272, USA.']","['R01 NS037614/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NS037614-10/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'NS37614/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2998453,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This debate considers the additional precautionary intervention needed to manage this risk, when it exceeds the protection afforded by the exposure guidelines as recommended by the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection. METHODS: The Bradford-Hill Criteria are guidelines for evaluating the scientific evidence that low frequency magnetic fields cause childhood leukaemia. The criteria are used for assessing the strength of scientific evidence and here have been applied to considering the strength of evidence that exposures to extremely low frequency magnetic fields may increase the risk of childhood leukaemia. The applicability of precaution is considered using the risk management framework outlined in a European Commission (EC) communication on the Precautionary Principle. That communication advises that measures should be proportionate, non-discriminatory, consistent with similar measures already taken, based on an examination of the benefits and costs of action and inaction, and subject to review in the light of new scientific findings. RESULTS: The main evidence for a risk is an epidemiological association observed in several studies and meta-analyses; however, the number of highly exposed children is small and the association could be due to a combination of selection bias, confounding and chance. Corroborating experimental evidence is limited insofar as there is no clear indication of harm at the field levels implicated; however, the aetiology of childhood leukaemia is poorly understood. Taking a precautionary approach suggests that low-cost intervention to reduce exposure is appropriate. This assumes that if the risk is real, its impact is likely to be small. It also recognises the consequential cost of any major intervention. The recommendation is controversial in that other interpretations of the data are possible, and low-cost intervention may not fully alleviate the risk. CONCLUSIONS: The debate shows how the EC risk management framework can be used to apply the Precautionary Principle to small and uncertain public health risks. However, despite the need for evidence-based policy making, many of the decisions remain value driven and therefore subjective.","['Health Protection Agency, Chilton, Didcot, Oxfordshire OX110RQ, UK. myron.maslanyj@hpa.org.uk']",,PMC3091578,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2010 Nov 5.,"BACKGROUND: Detection of absolute and relative lymphocytosis in otherwise asymptomatic elderly patients is very common in the primary care setting and frequently results in referral for screening of lymphoproliferative disorders. Since many B-cell chronic lymphoproliferative disorders (B-CLPD) are indeed asymptomatic at diagnosis in most patients with lymphocytosis, no sign of such a disorder is usually detected. Currently, specific guidelines for screening of patients with lymphocytosis are lacking. We investigated the practicability and clinical value of a single colour CD19 count performed by a primary care laboratory in order to improve the diagnostic follow-up of patients with lymphocytosis in a primary care laboratory. METHODS: The capability of detecting monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis and B-CLPD by CD19, was first confirmed in patient samples with known B-CLPD. Next, in a previously defined geographic area, a CD19 count was performed on all samples for patients aged >/=40 years with relative or absolute lymphocytosis but without neutropenia. Clinical follow-up, with a median of 4 years, was performed using both a survey among the requesting general practitioners and by analysis of the records of the referral hospitals within the borders of the defined area. RESULTS: A total of 520 cases with asymptomatic lymphocytosis were identified. In all cases, the CD19 count was performed; 207 (40%) showed increased values and 313 (60%) showed normal values. An increase in CD19 proved highly sensitive for detection of B-CLPD (98%, 95% CI; 94%-100%) with a high positive predictive value (57%, 95% CI; 50%-63%). The area under curve, the receiver-operating characteristic curve of the CD19 count (0.93, 95% CI; 0.91-0.96), was significantly higher compared to the absolute lymphocyte count (0.86, 95% CI; 0.83-0.89), especially in patients with moderate lymphocytosis. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that the CD19 count, performed by a primary care laboratory, is feasible and a promising tool for initial screening of lymphocytosis to discriminate B-CLPD from benign causes of lymphocytosis.","['Primary Care Laboratory, SALTRO, Utrecht, The Netherlands. g.d.teraa@amc.uva.nl']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2010 Nov 5.,"Wilms tumor is the most common renal tumor of childhood. However, other epithelial, mesenchymal, and neuroectodermal neoplasms may also arise in the kidney during childhood, several of which show specific age distributions; in the 1st year of life, mesoblastic nephroma and rhabdoid tumor are more common, whereas renal cell carcinoma, primitive neuroectodermal tumor, and anaplastic Wilms tumors are relatively more frequent in older children and adolescents. The aim of this study is to describe the spectrum of renal tumors in children aged 10-16 years using data from 1492 patients registered in the UK Wilms Tumour 3 Trial (1991-2001) and International Society of Paediatric Oncology Wilms Tumour Trial 2001 (2002-2008) clinical trials of renal tumors in childhood. There were 67 (4.6%) tumors in children aged 10-16 years: 50 Wilms tumors (74.6%), 10 (14.9%) renal cell carcinomas, 3 (4.5%) renal medullary carcinomas, 2 (3%) primitive neuroectodermal tumors, 1 clear cell sarcoma of kidney, and 1 desmoplastic small round cell tumor. Fourteen percent of the Wilms tumors in this age group had diffuse anaplasia. Among the 10 renal cell carcinomas, 4 were associated with t(Xp-11.2), 3 were of papillary type II, 1 was papillary type I, 1 was clear cell type, and 1 was unclassified. Five-year overall survival for Wilms tumor was 63% (43% for anaplastic tumors), significantly lower than reported overall survival for all pediatric Wilms tumors. Only 40% of patients with renal cell carcinoma survived, and all patients with other tumors died.","['Department Paediatric Oncology, The Institute of Cancer Research, London, UK. sergey.popov@icr.ac.uk']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Lysis of NK sensitived target cells could be mediated independently of antigen stimulation, and unlike cytotoxic T-lymphocytes, they do not require peptide presentation by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. NK cell cytotoxic activity is controlled by considerable number of cell surface Killer cell Immunoglobulin like Receptors (KIRs), which can exist in both inhibitory and activating isoforms. The inhibitory KIRs are mostly specific for HLA class I ligands and I HLA class like molecules, while the specificity of activating receptors is regarded to lectine-like superfamily. The role of NK cells in allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT): NK cells are the first lymphocyte subset that reconstitute the peripheral blood following allogeneic HSCT By selecting donors mismatched for relevant HLA ligands in the context of recipients KIR genotype, multiple roles for alloreactive donor NK cells have been demonstrated, in diminishing Graft vs. Host Disease (GvHD) through selective killing of recipient dendritic cells, prevention of graft rejection by killing recipient T cells and participation in Graft vs. Leukaemia (GvL) effect through destruction of residual host tumor cells. CONCLUSION: Investigation of KIRs heterogenity play an important role in the field of HSCT, because it is useful for the early diagnosis of post transplant complications and can serve as a predictive risk factor for GvHD development.","['Klinicki centar Vojvodine, Zavod za transfuziju krvi Vojvodine, Novi Sad. ssvu@eunet.rs']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Current chemotherapy protocols not only target the malignant cell, but are also highly toxic to normal hematopoietic cells as well. Leukemia patients thus experience prolonged times of neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia, which increase the risk for secondary complications like infections and bleeding. Twenty years ago leukemia patients were considered the ideal candidates to benefit from accelerated recovery of cytopenias by treatment with recombinant cytokines. Moreover, based on in vitro data, it was hypothesized that myeloid growth factors may sensitize AML cells to cytotoxic agents. Numerous clinical trials have documented the biologic activity of granulocyte and granulocyte-macrophage growth factors to accelerate neutrophil recovery after chemotherapy. However, there is high-level evidence that these myeloid growth factors neither reduce the incidence of severe infections nor improve the outcome of AML patients. Evidence from ALL trials is mixed with some studies suggesting a reduction of severe infections by myeloid growth factors whereas others report no effect. Most studies of acute leukemia patients suggested that myeloid growth factors are safe to use, however, a negative impact on event-free survival was found in one trial and an increased risk for secondary AML was reported in pediatric ALL patients. Thrombopoietins have not led so far to a significant increase in platelet numbers in leukemia patients. Chemokine receptor antagonists are now being evaluated in clinical trials for synergistic effects with chemotherapy and will be discussed briefly. Cytokine development mirrors the great advances that have been achieved in the understanding of regulatory mechanisms in hematopoiesis. As this understanding grows, new drugs and new applications will emerge.","['Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology, and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany. heuser.michael@mh-hannover.de']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This chapter focuses on cyclic and congenital neutropenia, two very interesting and rare hematological conditions causing severe chronic neutropenia. Both disorders respond well to treatment with the myeloid growth factor, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). This chapter describes the basic features of these diseases and addresses several current clinical issues regarding their diagnosis and management. Cyclic neutropenia is a rare, inherited autosomal dominant disorder due to mutations in the gene for neutrophil elastase (ELA-2 or ELANE). Usually these patients have regular oscillation of blood neutrophil counts with periods of severe neutropenia occurring every 21 days. During these periods, they have painful mouth ulcers, fevers, and bacterial infections. The most severe consequences are gangrene, bacteremia, and septic shock. Cyclic neutropenia patients respond well to treatment with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) given by subcutaneous injections on a daily or alternate-day basis. Severe congenital neutropenia is also a rare hematological disease, but it is probably more common than cyclic neutropenia. Blood neutrophils are extremely low on a continuing basis; the levels may be <0.2 x 10(9)/L, and the risk of severe bacterial infections is even greater than in cyclic neutropenia. The majority of cases are due to autosomal dominant inheritance of mutations in the ELA-2 or ELANE gene. Less commonly, mutations in HAX-1, G6PC3, and other genes cause this disorder. Treatment with G-CSF is usually effective, but the dose of G-CSF required to normalize blood neutrophils varies greatly. Ten to thirty percent of severe congenital neutropenia patients evolve to develop acute myeloid leukemia, necessitating careful clinical monitoring.","['Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98195, USA. dcdale@u.washington.edu']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An observational prospective multicentre cohort study was conducted over 2 years at two teaching hospitals. Patients with acute leukaemia or undergoing stem cell transplantation were included during neutropenia episodes. Rectal swabs were obtained at hospital admission and weekly thereafter until discharge or death. ESBL-EC colonized episodes were compared with non-colonized episodes. ESBL-EC strains were studied by PCR and isoelectric focusing, and molecular typing was performed by pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Among 217 episodes of neutropenia, the prevalence of ESBL-EC faecal carriage was 29% (14% at hospital admission). Multivariate analysis identified previous antibiotics as the only independent risk factor for ESBL-EC faecal colonization (OR 5.38; 95% CI 2.79-10.39). Analysis of ESBL-EC isolates revealed a polyclonal distribution with CTX-M predominance (81.3%). E. coli bacteraemia was mainly caused by non-ESBL producing strains and its rate was similar in both groups (13% vs. 11%). We found no association between ESBL-EC carriage and an increased risk of ESBL-EC bacteremia or a negative influence on other clinical outcomes, including length of hospitalisation, early and overall mortality rates. ESBL-EC faecal colonization is frequent in NCP but difficult to identify by epidemiological or clinical features on presentation. Prior antibiotic therapy is the major associated risk factor. In this setting colonization does not appear to have a significant clinical relevance. Thus, routine testing for ESBL-EC faecal carriage does not seem to be beneficial.","['Hematology Department, Hospital Duran i Reynals, l Hospitalet de Llobregat, Barcelona, Spain.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The current study examined the value of low-dose pomalidomide alone. The main eligibility criterion was transfusion-dependency or hemoglobin <10 gm per 100 ml. Anemia response was assessed by International Working Group criteria. Pomalidomide (0.5 mg/day) was given to 58 patients (median age 68 years); 46 (79%) were transfusion-dependent and 42 were JAK2V617F positive. Anemia response was documented only in the presence of JAK2V617F (24 vs 0%; P=0.03) but was not further affected by mutant allele burden (P=0.39); 9 of the 10 anemia responders became transfusion independent. Anemia response in JAK2V617F-positive patients was predicted by the presence of pomalidomide-induced basophilia in the first month of therapy (38 vs 6%; P=0.02) or absence of marked splenomegaly (38 vs 11%; P=0.05). A total of 14 (58%) of 24 patients with a platelet count of </= 100 x 10(9) cells/l experienced a >50% increment in platelet count. There were no spleen responses. Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia/neutropenia occurred in 2%/0% of patients. Low-dose pomalidomide is effective in the treatment of anemia associated with JAK2V617F-positive MF; response is predicted by early drug-induced basophilia.","['Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905, USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The majority of the cases belong to extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type (ENKTL) in the current WHO classification scheme. Gene-expression profiling (GEP) of 21 ENKTL and NK-cell lymphoma/leukemia patients, 17 NK- and T-cell lines and 5 indolent NK-cell large-granular-lymphocytic proliferation was performed and compared with 125 peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) patients previously studied. The molecular classifier derived for ENKTL patients was comprised of 84 transcripts with the majority of them contributed by the neoplastic NK cells. The classifier also identified a set of gammadelta-PTCLs both in the ENKTL cases as well as in cases initially classified as PTCL-not otherwise specified. These gammadelta-PTCLs expressed transcripts associated with the T-cell receptor (TCR)/CD3 complex, suggesting T cell rather than NK-cell lineage. They were very similar to NK-cell tumors by GEP, but were distinct from cytotoxic (alphabeta)-PTCL and hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma, indicating derivation from an ontogenically and functionally distinct subset of gammadelta T cells. They showed distinct expression of Vgamma9, Vdelta2 transcripts and were positive for TCRgamma, but negative for TCRbeta by immunohistochemistry. Targeted inhibition of two oncogenic pathways (AURKA and NOTCH-1) by small-molecular inhibitors induced significant growth arrest in NK-cell lines, thus providing a rationale for clinical trials of these inhibitors in NK-cell malignancies.","['Department of Pathology and Microbiology, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE 68198-3135, USA.']","['5U01/CA114778/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA36727/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P20 RR016469/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'P50CA136411-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,['International Peripheral T-cell Lymphoma Project'],,,['Leukemia. 2011 Aug;25(8):1377'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Altered DNA methylation of genes has shown promise as a source of novel prognostic makers in a number of cancers. Here we have studied the potential utility of a panel of methylation markers (CD38, HOXA4 and BTG4) in 118 CLL patients. Each of the three loci assessed exhibited frequent methylation, as determined by COBRA analysis, and individually correlated with either good (CD38, BTG4 methylation) or poor (HOXA4 methylation) prognosis. Using a combined approach to produce an overall methylation score, we found that methylation score was significantly associated with time to first treatment in CLL patients. Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that methylation score was the strongest predictor of time to first treatment, and was independent of IGHV gene mutational status and CD38 expression. This study provides proof of principle that a panel of methylation markers can be used for additional risk stratification of CLL patients.","['Crucible Laboratory, Institute for Ageing and Health, Newcastle University, UK.']",,PMC3092678,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We evaluated the efficacy of lenalidomide as front-line therapy for older AML patients. In this phase 2 study, patients 60 years of age or older with untreated AML received high-dose (HD) lenalidomide at 50 mg daily for up to 2 28-day cycles. If patients achieved a complete remission (CR)/CR with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi) or did not progress after 2 cycles of HD lenalidomide, they received low-dose lenalidomide (10 mg daily) until disease progression, an unacceptable adverse event, or completion of 12 cycles. Thirty-three AML patients (median age, 71 years) were enrolled with intermediate (55%), unfavorable (39%), or unknown (6%) cytogenetic risk. Overall CR/CRi rate was 30%, and 53% in patients completing HD lenalidomide. The CR/CRi rate was significantly higher in patients presenting with a low (< 1000/muL) circulating blast count (50%, P = .01). The median time to CR/CRi was 30 days, and duration of CR/CRi was 10 months (range, 1- >/= 17 months). The most common grades >/= 3 toxicities were thrombocytopenia, anemia, infection, and neutropenia.

Functional studies of these human oncogenes have shown that most of them were not able to transform a haematologic progenitor when acting alone and that cooperation with other oncogenic events was required.

To investigate the importance of MIP-1alpha in recruitment of microglia to the brain, we treated rats with MIP-1alpha antibodies before and after PVC-211 MuLV infection. This caused a delay in the development of paralysis which was associated with a decrease in activated microglia without affecting virus expression. To determine the source of activated microglia, rats were splenectomized 4 days after virus infection. Splenectomized rats showed a delay in disease development that was associated with decreased numbers of activated microglia without affecting virus expression. Together, these results suggest that MIP-1alpha is directly involved in the neurodegeneration induced in rats by PVC-211 MuLV by recruiting macrophages/microglia from the periphery into regions of the brain that eventually become diseased.","['Laboratory of Cancer Prevention, National Cancer Institute-Frederick, Frederick, MD 21702, USA.']",['ZIA BC005657-20/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],PMC3053016,['NIHMS246153'],,['Published by Elsevier Inc.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The construction of single-chain MHC class I molecules in which the peptide, beta(2)-microglobulin, and MHC heavy chain are all joined together via flexible linkers increases peptide-MHC stability. We have expressed two T cell epitopes that may be useful in leukemia treatment as single-chain MHC class I molecules, aiming to develop a system for the expansion of antigen-specific CD8(+) T cells in vitro. Disulfide trap versions of these single-chain MHC molecules were also created to improve anchoring of the peptides in the MHC molecule. Unexpectedly, we observed that soluble disulfide trap single-chain molecules expressed in eukaryotic cells were prone to homodimerization, depending on the binding affinity of the peptide epitope. The dimers were remarkably stable and efficiently recognized by conformation-specific antibodies, suggesting that they consisted of largely correctly folded molecules. However, dimerization was not observed when the disulfide trap molecules were expressed as full-length, transmembrane-anchored molecules. Our results further emphasize the importance of peptide binding affinity for the efficient folding of MHC class I molecules.","['Department of Immunology, Wright-Fleming Institute, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom.']","['18440/ARC_/Arthritis Research UK/United Kingdom', '18440/VAC_/Versus Arthritis/United Kingdom', 'BB/F020732/1/BB_/Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council/United', 'Kingdom']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, transplant candidates, recipients and donors living in endemic regions frequently report previous episodes of malaria. This fact could represent an important risk for immunosuppressed recipients that could develop severe malaria cases. We report a case of hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) in which the donor had a history of previous malaria, and close monitoring was performed before and after procedure by parasitological and molecular tests. The donor presented Plasmodium vivax in thick blood smears one month after transplant and was treated according to Brazilian Health Ministry guidelines. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was able to detect malaria infection in the donor one week earlier than thick blood film. Even without positive results, the recipient was pre-emptively treated with chloroquine in order to prevent the disease. We highlight the importance of monitoring recipients and donors in transplant procedures with the aim of reducing the risk of malaria transmission.","['Malaria Research Center, Superintendence of Endemic Diseases Control, Health Secretariat of Sao Paulo State, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) can simultaneously detect copy number changes of multiple loci in one simple PCR reaction, making it an attractive alternative to FISH. To enhance the clinical robustness and further harness MLPA technology for routine laboratory operations, we have developed and validated a protocol for comprehensive, automatic data analysis and interpretation. A training set of 50 normal samples was used to establish reference ranges for each individual probe, for the calling of statistically significant copy number changes. The maximum normal ranges of 2 and 3 standard deviations (SD) are distributed between 0.82 and 1.18 (Mean +/- 2SD, 95% CI, P = 0.05), and between 0.73 and 1.27 (Mean +/- 3SD, 99% CI, P = 0.01), respectively. We found an excellent correlation between MLPA and FISH with 93.6% concordance (P<0.0001) from a testing cohort of 100 clinically suspected CLL cases. MLPA analyses done on 94/100 patients showed sensitivity and specificity of 94.2% and 92.9%, respectively. MLPA detected additional copy number gains on 18q21.1 and chromosome 19, and novel micro-deletions at 19q13.43 and 19p13.2 loci in six samples. Three FISH-failed samples were tested positive by MLPA, while three 13q- cases with a low percentage of leukemia cells (7%, 12% and 19%) were not detected by MLPA. The improved CLL MLPA represents a high-throughput, accurate, cost-effective and user-friendly platform that can be used as a first-line screening test in a clinical laboratory.","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Quest Diagnostics Nichols Institute, San Juan Capistrano, California, United States of America.']",,PMC2963645,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous studies revealed that five SNPs in IL-15, rs10519612, rs10519613, rs35964658, rs17007695 and rs17015014, were significantly associated with childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) treatment response. In adult ALL, the expression of IL-15 was also correlated with the immunophenotypes of ALL. Therefore, we hypothesize that SNPs of IL-15 might also be associated with adult ALL. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We genotyped the above five SNPs of IL-15 gene by PCR-RFLP assays in adult ALL case-control studies. The current study included 121 adult ALL patients and 263 healthy controls. IL-15 genotypes and haplotypes were determined and the associations with the risk of ALL were analyzed by logistic regression. SNPs rs10519612 and rs17007695 were significantly associated with ALL (P = 0.013 and P = 0.001). We observed a 2-fold and 2.4-fold excess risk of developing ALL for the rs10519612 CC and rs17007695 TC genotype carriers compared with non-carriers, respectively. Haplotype analysis revealed that haplotypes ACAC, CAGT and CCAT were significantly associated with adult B-ALL, while haplotype CCAT conferred susceptibility to T-ALL. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that IL-15 gene polymorphisms are significantly associated with ALL in adult Chinese population.","['Laboratory of Cellular and Molecular Tumor Immunology, Cyrus Tang Hematology Center, Department of Hematology, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Soochow University, Suzhou, China.']",,PMC2963612,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the presence of zVAD-fmk, a broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor, Fas engagement can also trigger an alternative, non-apoptotic caspase-independent form of cell death, which is initiated by RIP1. Controversy exists as to the ability of caspase-10 to mediate cell death in response to FasL (CD95L or CD178). Herein, the role of caspase-10 in FasL-induced cell death has been re-evaluated. METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The present study shows that FasL-induced cell death was completely impaired in caspase-8- and caspase-10-doubly deficient (I9-2e) Jurkat leukaemia T-cell lines. Over-expressing of either caspase-8 or caspase-10 in I9-2e cells triggered cell death and restored sensitivity to FasL, further arguing for a role of both initiator caspases in Fas apoptotic signalling. In the presence of zVAD-fmk, FasL triggered an alternative form of cell death similarly in wild-type (A3) and in caspase-8-deficient Jurkat cells expressing endogenous caspase-10 (clone I9-2d). Cell death initiated by Fas stimulation in the presence of zVAD-fmk was abrogated in I9-2e cells as well as in HeLa cells, which did not express endogenous caspase-10, indicating that caspase-10 somewhat participates in this alternative form of cell death. Noteworthy, ectopic expression of caspase-10 in I9-2e and HeLa cells restored the ability of FasL to trigger cell death in the presence of zVAD-fmk. As a matter of fact, FasL-triggered caspase-10 processing still occurred in the presence of zVAD-fmk. CONCLUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE: Altogether, these data provide genetic evidence for the involvement of initiator caspase-10 in FasL-induced cell death and indicate that zVAD-fmk does not abrogate caspase-10 processing and cytotoxicity in Fas signalling. Our study also questions the existence of an alternative caspase-independent cell death pathway in Fas signalling.","['U858 INSERM (Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale), Departement Cancer, Equipe 14, Toulouse, France.']",,PMC2964310,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These mutations result in constitutive activation of FLT3, and FLT3 inhibitors are currently undergoing trials in AML patients selected on FLT3 molecular status. However, the transient and partial responses observed suggest that FLT3 mutational status alone does not provide complete information on FLT3 biological activity at the individual patient level. Examination of variation in cellular responsiveness to signaling modulation may be more informative. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Using single cell network profiling (SCNP), cells were treated with extracellular modulators and their functional responses were quantified by multiparametric flow cytometry. Intracellular signaling responses were compared between healthy bone marrow myeloblasts (BMMb) and AML leukemic blasts characterized as FLT3 wild type (FLT3-WT) or FLT3-ITD. Compared to healthy BMMb, FLT3-WT leukemic blasts demonstrated a wide range of signaling responses to FLT3 ligand (FLT3L), including elevated and sustained PI3K and Ras/Raf/Erk signaling. Distinct signaling and apoptosis profiles were observed in FLT3-WT and FLT3-ITD AML samples, with more uniform signaling observed in FLT3-ITD AML samples. Specifically, increased basal p-Stat5 levels, decreased FLT3L induced activation of the PI3K and Ras/Raf/Erk pathways, decreased IL-27 induced activation of the Jak/Stat pathway, and heightened apoptotic responses to agents inducing DNA damage were observed in FLT3-ITD AML samples. Preliminary analysis correlating these findings with clinical outcomes suggests that classification of patient samples based on signaling profiles may more accurately reflect FLT3 signaling deregulation and provide additional information for disease characterization and management. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These studies show the feasibility of SCNP to assess modulated intracellular signaling pathways and characterize the biology of individual AML samples in the context of genetic alterations.","['Nodality, Inc, South San Francisco, California, United States of America.']",,PMC2965086,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Abrogation or loss of the ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) protein, a DNA damage signaling regulator, increases the incidence of chromosome translocations. However, how ATM protects cells from chromosome translocations is still unclear. Chromosome translocations involving the MLL gene on 11q23 are the most frequent chromosome abnormalities in secondary leukemias associated with chemotherapy employing etoposide, a topoisomerase II poison. Here we show that ATM deficiency results in the excessive binding of the DNA recombination protein RAD51 at the translocation breakpoint hotspot of 11q23 chromosome translocation after etoposide exposure. Binding of Replication protein A (RPA) and the chromatin remodeler INO80, which facilitate RAD51 loading on damaged DNA, to the hotspot were also increased by ATM deficiency. Thus, in addition to activating DNA damage signaling, ATM may avert chromosome translocations by preventing excessive loading of recombinational repair proteins onto translocation breakpoint hotspots.","['Department of Cellular Biology, RIRBM, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima, Japan.']",,PMC2965082,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

No adverse reaction occurred following the infusion of mismatched units and engraftment of the suboptimal-dose matched unit occurred rapidly, with no molecular evidence of engraftment of mismatched cords. Early molecular remission of ALL was demonstrated using a novel PCR for a mitochondrial DNA mutation in the leukaemic clone. The cell dose of the matched cord was well below that recommended to engraft a 70 kg recipient.

METHODS: This study took place in the Pharmacology Research Laboratory at Guangxi Medical University, China, between March and May 2007. Two hundred and forty rats were randomly divided into I/R group, sham-operated group, high-, medium-, and low-dose of YLS polysaccharide groups, and nimodipine (Nim) group. The animals were intragastrically administered with drugs for 7 days. An operation was performed to induce an MCAO model in the rats. Reperfusion was started after 2 hours of MCAO. The influences of YLS polysaccharide on the neurological score, the brain water content, the infarct volume, the activities of super oxide dismutase (SOD) and nitric oxide synthase (NOS), the contents of malondialdehyde (MDA) and nitric oxide (NO), the expressions of B-cell lymphoma/leukemia-2 (Bcl-2) and Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax) in brain tissue were investigated; the morphological changes of rat cerebral cortical neurons were observed. RESULTS: Compared with the I/R group, YLS polysaccharide reduced the neurological score, the brain water content, the infract volume, MDA and NO contents, the NOS activity, and the expression of Bax, and increased SOD activity, and the expression of Bcl-2 in the brain tissue, and neuronal edema was reduced. CONCLUSION: The YLS polysaccharide has a protective effect on cerebral ischemia/ reperfusion injury; the mechanism may be related to attenuating free radicals, and increasing the Bcl-2/Bax ratio.","['Department of Pharmacology Guangxi Medical University, Nanning, China.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2010 Nov 3.,"Bone marrow mesenchymal cells (MSCs) can protect leukemic cells from chemotherapy, thus increasing their survival rate. We studied the potential molecular mechanisms underlying this effect in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells. Coculture of ALL cells with MSCs induced on the lymphoblast plasma membrane the expression of a signaling complex formed by hERG1 (human ether-a-go-go-related gene 1) channels, the beta(1)-integrin subunit, and the chemokine receptor CXC chemokine receptor-4. The assembly of such a protein complex activated both the extracellular signal-related kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) and the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt prosurvival signaling pathways. At the same time, ALL cells became markedly resistant to chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. hERG1 channel function appeared to be important for both the initiation of prosurvival signals and the development of drug resistance, because specific channel blockers decreased the protective effect of MSCs. NOD/SCID mice engrafted with ALL cells and treated with channel blockers showed reduced leukemic infiltration and had higher survival rates. Moreover, hERG1 blockade enhanced the therapeutic effect produced by corticosteroids. Our findings provide a rationale for clinical testing of hERG1 blockers in the context of antileukemic therapy for patients with ALL.","['Department of Experimental Pathology and Oncology, University of Firenze, Firenze, Italy.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2010 Nov 3.,"Vitamin D insufficiency is common globally and low levels are linked to higher cancer incidence. Although vitamin D insufficiency is related to inferior prognosis in some cancers, no data exist for chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL). We evaluated the relationship of 25(OH)D serum levels with time-to-treatment (TTT) and overall survival (OS) in newly diagnosed CLL patients participating in a prospective cohort study (discovery cohort) and a separate cohort of previously untreated patients participating in an observational study (confirmation cohort). Of 390 CLL patients in the discovery cohort, 119 (30.5%) were 25(OH)D insufficient. After a median follow-up of 3 years, TTT (hazard ratio[HR] = 1.66; P = .005) and OS (HR = 2.39; P = .01) were shorter for 25(OH)D-insufficient patients. In the validation cohort, 61 of 153 patients (39.9%) were 25(OH)D insufficient. After a median follow-up of 9.9 years, TTT (HR = 1.59; P = .05) and OS (HR 1.63; P = .06) were again shorter for 25(OH)D-insufficient patients. On pooled multivariable analysis of patients in both cohorts adjusting for age, sex, Rai stage, CD38 status, ZAP-70 status, immunoglobulin heavy chain variable (IGHV) gene mutation status, CD49d status, and cytogenetic abnormalities assessed by interphase fluorescent in situ hybridization testing, 25(OH)D insufficiency remained an independent predictor of TTT (HR = 1.47; P = .008), although the association with OS was not significant (HR = 1.47; P = .07). Vitamin D insufficiency is associated with inferior TTT and OS in CLL patients. Whether normalizing vitamin D levels in deficient CLL patients would improve outcome merits clinical testing.","['Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic, 200 First Street SW, Rochester, MN 55905, USA.']","['K23 CA113408/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA097274/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA97274/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 113408/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3056589,,,,,,['Blood. 2011 Feb 3;117(5):1439-40.

Epub 2010 Nov 3.,"BACKGROUND: The Meis1 protein represents an important cofactor for Hox and Pbx1 and is implicated in human and murine leukemias. Though much is known about the role of meis1 in leukemogenesis, its function in normal hematopoiesis remains largely unclear. Here we characterized the role of the proto-oncogene, meis1, during zebrafish primitive and definitive hematopoiesis. DESIGN AND METHODS: Zebrafish embryos were stained with o-dianisidine to detect hemoglobin-containing cells and Sudan black to quantify neutrophils. The numbers of other cells (scl-, gata1- and alas2-positive cells) were also quantified by measuring the corresponding stained areas of the embryos. We used anti-Meis1 antibody and whole mount immunohistochemistry to determine the pattern of expression of Meis1 during zebrafish development and then analyzed the functional role of Meis1 by knocking-down the meis1 gene. RESULTS: Using antisense morpholino oligomers to interrupt meis1 expression we found that, although primitive macrophage development could occur unhampered, posterior erythroid differentiation required meis1, and its absence resulted in a severe decrease in the number of mature erythrocytes. Furthermore a picture emerged that meis1 exerts important effects on later stages of erythrocyte maturation and that these effects are independent of gata1, but under the control of scl. In addition, meis1 morpholino knock-down led to dramatic single arteriovenous tube formation. We also found that knock-down of pbx1 resulted in a phenotype that was strikingly similar to that of meis1 knock-down zebrafish. CONCLUSIONS: These results imply that meis1, jointly with pbx1, regulates primitive hematopoiesis as well as vascular development.","['Department of Haematology, University of Cambridge, Long Road, Cambridge CB2 0PT, UK.']","['RG/09/012/28096/BHF_/British Heart Foundation/United Kingdom', '077037/Z/05/Z/WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', '082597/Z/07/Z/WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', '077047/Z/05/Z/WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom']",PMC3031685,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We treated a 26-year-old female who presented with an osteochondral defect of the talus after necrosis. ALL had previously been diagnosed in 1994 and the patients had been treated with chemotherapy included corticosteroid. She was thereafter diagnosed to have bilateral osteonecrosis of the talus in 1996, and thus had been treated with weight-bearing restriction using a patellar tendon bearing brace. She felt pain in her right ankle in 2006. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed an osteochondral defect in the lateral aspect of the talus and normal bone marrow signal in the right ankle. We performed arthroscopic treatment by means of a bone marrow stimulation technique. At second-look arthroscopy, the aspect of the talus was completely covered by fibrocartilage like tissue. This procedure is therefore considered to be one option for the treatment of an osteochondral defect of the talus after necrosis in young patients.","['Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Fukuoka University School of Medicine, 7-45-1 Nanakuma, Jonan-ku, Fukuoka 814-0180, Japan. ichiroy@cis.fukuoka-u.ac.jp']",,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2009 European Foot and Ankle Society.

Epub 2010 Nov 1.,"Reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) extends the curative potential of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) to patients with hematologic malignancies unable to withstand myeloablative conditioning. We prospectively analyzed the outcomes of 123 patients (median age, 57 years; range, 23-70 years) with hematologic malignancies treated with a uniform RIC regimen of cyclophosphamide, fludarabine, and total-body irradiation (200 cGy) with or without antithymocyte globulin followed by related donor allogeneic HCT at the University of Minnesota between 2002 and 2008. The cohort included 45 patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), 27 with aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), 8 with indolent NHL, 10 with Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), 10 with myeloma, and 23 with acute lymphocytic leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia, other leukemias, or myeloproliferative disorders. The probability of 4-year overall survival was 73% for patients with indolent NHL, 58% for those with aggressive NHL, 67% for those with HL, 30% for those with AML/MDS, and only 10% for those with myeloma. Corresponding outcomes for relapse in these patients were 0%, 32%, 50%, 33%, and 38%, and those for progression-free survival were 73%, 45%, 27%, 27%, and 10%. The incidence of treatment-related mortality was 14% at day +100 and 22% at 1 year. The incidence of grade II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease was 38% at day +100, and that of chronic graft-versus-host disease was 50% at 2 years. Multivariate analysis revealed superior overall survival and progression-free survival in patients with both indolent and aggressive NHL compared with those with AML/MDS, HL, or myeloma. Worse 1-year treatment-related mortality was observed in patients with a Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation Comorbidity Index score >/= 3 and in cytomegalovirus-seropositive recipients. These results suggest that (1) RIC conditioning was well tolerated by an older, heavily pretreated population; (2) patients with indolent and aggressive NHL respond well to RIC conditioning, highlighting the importance of the graft-versus-lymphoma effect; and (3) additional peri-transplantation manipulations are needed to improve outcomes for patients with AML/MDS or myeloma receiving RIC conditioning before HCT.","['Blood and Marrow Transplant Program, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA. ewarlick@umn.edu']",['P01 CA065493/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC4082980,['NIHMS606203'],,"['2011 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.

The manufacturer's searches for clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness data were appropriate and included all relevant studies. The submission's evidence came from a single, unpublished, well-conducted randomised controlled trial (RCT) comparing rituximab in combination with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide (R-FC) with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide (FC) alone for the first-line treatment of CLL. There was a statistically significant increase in progression-free survival (PFS) with R-FC compared with FC alone {median 39.8 months vs 32.2 months; hazard ratio [HR] 0.56 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.43 to 0.72]}. However, the initial significant treatment benefit for R-FC compared with FC for overall survival was not maintained at a slightly longer follow-up time [median 25.4 months; adjusted HR 0.72 (95% CI 0.48 to 1.09)]. Response rates, numbers of patients with event-free survival and duration of response all favoured treatment with R-FC. Additional evidence from a mixed-treatment comparison model indicated R-FC to be significantly superior to chlorambucil alone for both PFS and overall and complete response rates. The incidence of grade 3 or 4 adverse events was higher in the R-FC arm (77%) than in the FC arm (62%). Dose modifications were also more frequent in this arm, but this did not lead to differences in treatment discontinuation. Roche used a three-state Markov model (PFS, progressed and death) to model the cost-effectiveness of R-FC compared with FC and chlorambucil alone. The model used a cycle length of 1 month and a lifetime time horizon. The approach taken to modelling was reasonable and the sources and justification of estimates were generally sound. The base-case analysis produced an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 13,189 pounds per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) for R-FC versus FC, and 6422 pounds per QALY for the comparison of R-FC versus chlorambucil, suggesting that R-FC is cost-effective at normal willingness-to-pay thresholds. One-way sensitivity analyses produced a range of ICERs from 10,249 pounds to 22,661 pounds per QALY for R-FC versus FC, and 5612 pounds and 6921 pounds per QALY for R-FC versus chlorambucil. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis results matched the deterministic results very closely. However, the sensitivity analysis did not fully investigate the uncertainty associated with differential values across arms or with the structural assumptions of the model, and utility values were not drawn from an empirical study. The NICE guidance issued as a result of the STA states that: Rituximab in combination with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide (R-FC) is recommended as an option for the first-line treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia in people for whom fludarabine in combination with cyclophosphamide (FC) is considered appropriate. Rituximab in combination with chemotherapy agents other than fludarabine and cyclophosphamide is not recommended for the first-line treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia.","['Peninsula Technology Assessment Group (PenTAG), Exeter, UK. caroline.main@pms.ac.uk']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Evidence was available in the form of one open-label, ongoing, unpublished randomised controlled trial (RCT), REACH (Rituximab in the Study of Relapsed Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia), conducted by the manufacturer, which compared rituximab with a fludarabine and cyclophosphamide combination (R-FC) to fludarabine and cyclophosphamide (FC) only. REACH was scheduled to run for 8 years; however, the data provided were immature, with a median observation time at the time of data analysis of 2.1 years. REACH provided evidence of prolonged progression free survival with R-FC compared to FC (10 months, investigators' data), but no evidence of an overall survival benefit with R-FC. Patients refractory to fludarabine and with prior rituximab exposure were excluded from REACH and no controlled studies were identified by the ERG for these patient groups. The ERG had concerns about the structure of the economic model submitted by the manufacturer, which did not allow improvement in quality of life from treatment while in a progressed state. The manufacturer's model further assumed a divergence in cumulative deaths between the R-FC and FC treatment arms from the outset, which did not accord with observed data from REACH. When the survival advantage was removed, the manufacturer's base-case incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) changed from 15,593 pounds to between 40,000 pounds and 42,000 pounds per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). With no survival advantage, the ICER became sensitive to changes in utility. There was no good empirical evidence on the utility of CLL patients in different states. Allowing for the possibility of a survival advantage with rituximab (although not supported by current evidence), the ERG performed further modelling, which found that rituximab would be cost-effective at 20,000 pounds/QALY (30,000 pounds/QALY) if a reduction in survival advantage relative to the manufacturer's base case of 40% (80%) was assumed. The guidance issued by NICE in July 2010 as a result of the STA recommends rituximab with FC for people with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, except when the condition is refractory to fludarabine or where there has been previous treatment with rituximab.","['Unit of Public Health, Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK. j.dretzke@bham.ac.uk']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHOD: K562 cells in culture medium in vitro were given different concentrations of PON (10-50 micromol x L(-1)) for 24, 48 and 72 h. The inhibitory rate of the cells was measured by MTT assay, cell apoptotic rates were detected by flow cytometry (FCM) using Annexin V staining after K562 cells were treated with different concentrations of PON for 72 hours, and cell morphology was observed by Wright-Giemsa staining. Western blot was used to detect caspase-3 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) expression, and the protein levels in mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways (MAPKs, p-P38, p-ERK and p-JNK) as well as p-AKT and p-P85 in PI3K/AKT signaling pathways were also detected. RESULT: PON (over 30 micromol x L(-1)) could inhibit the growth of K562 cells in both time- and dose-dependent manner. FCM analysis revealed that apoptotic cells were gradually increased in a dose-dependent manner after treatment for 72 hours, and that marked morphological changes of cell apoptosis such as condensation of chromatin was clearly observed by Wright-Giemsa staining after treatment by 50 micromol x L(-1) PON. Western blot showed cleavage of the caspase-3 zymogen protein (32 kD), with the appearance of its 17 kD subunit, and a cleaved 89 kD fragment of 116 kD PARP was also found. Furthermore, Western blotting also showed that expression of p-AKT and p-P85 in PI3K/AKT signaling pathways was downregulated dramatically whereas the expression of p-P38 as well as p-ERK and p-JNK remained unchanged after the cells were treated by PON for 48 h. CONCLUSION: The results demonstrate that PON exhibits in vitro anti-leukemia effect by induction of apoptosis in K562 cells, and that PON induced apoptosis in K562 cells mainly related to activation of caspase-3 as well as inactivation of PI3K/AKT signaling pathway via down regulation of the expression of p-AKT and p-P85 protein levels. These results provide strong laboratory evidence for further anti-leukemia trials of PON.","['Hematological Department & Institute, Third Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou 510630, China.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2010 Nov 3.,"Vandetanib is an orally active small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) with activity against several pathways implicated in malignancy including the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor pathway, the epidermal growth factor receptor pathway, the platelet derived growth factor receptor beta pathway, and REarranged during Transfection pathway. To determine if vandetanib-mediated inhibition of receptor tyrosine kinases is a potential therapeutic strategy for pediatric acute leukemia, these studies aimed to characterize the activity of vandetanib against acute leukemia in vitro. Treatment of leukemia cell lines with vandetanib resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in proliferation and survival. Vandetanib's anti-leukemic activity appeared mediated by multiple mechanisms including accumulation in G1 phase at lower concentrations and apoptosis at higher concentrations. Alterations in cell surface markers also occurred with vandetanib treatment, suggesting induction of differentiation. In combination with DNA damaging agents (etoposide and doxorubicin) vandetanib demonstrated synergistic induction of cell death. However in combination with the anti-metabolite methotrexate, vandetanib had an antagonistic effect on cell death. Although several targets of vandetanib are expressed on acute leukemia cell lines, expression of vandetanib targets did not predict vandetanib sensitivity and alone are therefore not likely candidate biomarkers in patients with acute leukemia. Interactions between vandetanib and standard chemotherapy agents in vitro may help guide choice of combination regimens for further evaluation in the clinical setting for patients with relapsed/refractory acute leukemia. Taken together, these preclinical data support clinical evaluation of vandetanib, in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy, for pediatric leukemia.","['Department of Pediatrics, Section of Hematology, Oncology, and Bone Marrow Transplantation, University of Colorado Denver, 13123 East 16th Avenue B-115, Aurora, CO 80045, USA.

Epub 2010 Nov 3.,"Clinical tumor remissions after adoptive T-cell therapy are frequently not durable due to limited survival and homing of transfused tumor-reactive T cells, what can be mainly attributed to the long-term culture necessary for in vitro expansion. Here, we introduce an approach allowing the reliable in vitro generation of leukemia-reactive cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) from naive CD8+ T cells of healthy donors, leading to high cell numbers within a relatively short culture period. The protocol includes the stimulation of purified CD45RA+ CD8+ T cells with primary acute myeloid leukemia blasts of patient origin in HLA-class I-matched allogeneic mixed lymphocyte-leukemia cultures. The procedure allowed the isolation of a large diversity of HLA-A/-B/-C-restricted leukemia-reactive CTL clones and oligoclonal lines. CTLs showed reactivity to either leukemia blasts exclusively, or to leukemia blasts as well as patient-derived B lymphoblastoid-cell lines (LCLs). In contrast, LCLs of donor origin were not lysed. This reactivity pattern suggested that CTLs recognized leukemia-associated antigens or hematopoietic minor histocompatibility antigens. Consistent with this hypothesis, most CTLs did not react with patient-derived fibroblasts. The efficiency of the protocol could be further increased by addition of interleukin-21 during primary in vitro stimulation. Most importantly, leukemia-reactive CTLs retained the expression of early T-cell differentiation markers CD27, CD28, CD62L and CD127 for several weeks during culture. The effective in vitro expansion of leukemia-reactive CD8+ CTLs from naive CD45RA+ precursors of healthy donors can accelerate the molecular definition of candidate leukemia antigens and might be of potential use for the development of adoptive CTL therapy in leukemia.","['Department of Medicine III, Hematology and Oncology, University Medical Center of the Johannes Gutenberg-University Mainz, Langenbeckstrasse 1, Mainz, Germany.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Imatinib copy drugs are currently available in some countries; however, the safety and efficacy of these compounds have not been widely assessed. We present a patient who received the copy drug imatinib-COPER, lost hematologic response while on therapy, and was subsequently treated with branded Glivec. This report, and other published cases, suggests that imatinib copy drugs may not be equivalent to branded Glivec in pharmacology, safety, and efficacy. The case was a 42-year-old Moroccan male with CML. Initial therapy with hydroxyurea alone followed by hydroxyurea in combination with interferon-a resulted in durable complete hematologic remission (CHR). Due to adverse effects, the patient was switched to imatinib-COPER at 400 mg/day. Despite compliance with therapy, he lost his CHR after 2 years and presented with aplasia requiring a blood transfusion. Administration of Glivec in combination with hydroxyurea resulted in re-achievement of complete hematologic remission that was stable at last follow-up. Data from large-scale trials demonstrating high and durable responses and favorable safety have resulted in Glivec being considered as standard frontline therapy for patients with CML. Such trials have not been conducted for imatinib copy drugs. In the absence of clinical trial data, information from individual cases is critical to assessing the utility of copy drugs. This report suggests that initial treatment with an imatinib copy drug may compromise efficacy.","['Clinique Belvedere, Casablanca, Morocco.']",,PMC2968768,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SETTING: A tertiary care hospital in Karachi, Pakistan. STUDY DESIGN: This is a retrospective study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Children diagnosed with ALL were evaluated over a period of 17 years (January 1, 1989 to December 31, 2006). Data was collected by reviewing the medical records of the patients and the prognostic factors analyzed by us include age, gender, white blood cell count, central nervous system and mediastinal involvement at presentation, morphology and immunophenotype of the blast cells, and response to induction therapy. RESULTS: There were 46 patients diagnosed during the study period and on regular follow-up. Forty five (97.8%) of these were in complete remission after 28 days of induction therapy. Thirty patients (65.2%) were alive and doing well at the time of study. Of these 30 patients, 26 (86.6%) remained relapse free while only four (13.3%) had relapsed. The remaining 16 patients (34.7%) did not survive including 11 (68.7%) who had a relapse. Only significant variables in terms of prognosis were age and ALL phenotype with a P value 0.04 and 0.03 respectively. CONCLUSION: We found that ALL is a frequent childhood hematological malignancy in our setting and is more prevalent in males and children less than ten years of age. Age and leukemia phenotype emerged as the important prognostic factors in pediatric ALL in our patients.","['Royal Darwin Hospital, Casuarina, Australia.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated the presence of infections in Iranian Holstein cattle and determined changes in hematological values for infected animals. METHODOLOGY: Nested PCR was used on blood samples from 143 animals Holstein cattle to detect proviral BIV and BLV gag sequences. Flow cytometric analysis was performed using monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against CD4, CD8, and CD21 bovine T lymphocyte subsets. RESULTS: Proviral BIV and BLV gag sequences were detected in 20.3% and 17% of the animals, respectively. BIV-BLV confection was also detected in 4.2% of the study population but this was not statistically significant. Flow cytometric analysis showed that both BIV-infected cows and non-infected ones had CD4/CD8 ratios of 2.45 and 1.43, respectively, and this difference was significant. BLV infected and non-infected animals had no significant differences in their CD4/CD8 ratio. In comparison to non-infected cattle, those with both BIV and BLV had a significant decrease in their CD4/CD8 ratios (1.5 % vs. 2.3; P = 0.01). CONCLUSION: This is the first report of BIV and BLV infections in Iran. We found no evidence that infection with one agent predisposed an animal to infection with the other. BIV infection may have a role in decreasing T CD8 counts, but this may depend on the genetics of the cattle and virus strains involved.","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran. nikbakht@ut.ac.ir']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2010 Oct 28.,"LMO2 (LIM domain only 2), also known as rhombotin-2, is a transcriptional regulator that is essential for normal haematopoietic development. In malignant haematopoiesis, its ectopic expression in T cells is involved in the pathogenesis of leukaemia. LMO2 contains four zinc-finger domains and binds to the ubiquitous nuclear adaptor protein Ldb1 via the LIM-interaction domain (LID). Together, they act as scaffolding proteins and bridge important haematopoietic transcription factors such as SCL/Tal1, E2A and GATA-1. Solving the structure of the LMO2:Ldb1-LID complex would therefore be a first step towards understanding how haematopoietic specific protein complexes form and would also provide an attractive target for drug development in anticancer therapy, especially for T-cell leukaemia. Here, the expression, purification, crystallization and data collection of a fusion protein consisting of the two LIM domains of LMO2 linked to the LID domain of Ldb1 via a flexible linker is reported. The crystals belonged to space group C2, with unit-cell parameters a = 179.9, b = 51.5, c = 114.7 A, beta = 90.1 degrees , and contained five molecules in the asymmetric unit. Multiple-wavelength anomalous dispersion (MAD) data have been collected at the zinc X-ray absorption edge to a resolution of 2.8 A and the data were used to solve the structure of the LMO2:Ldb1-LID complex. Refinement and analysis of the electron-density map is in progress.","['Division of Structural Biology, The Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics, University of Oxford, Roosevelt Drive, Oxford OX3 7BN, England.']",['G0500367/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom'],PMC3001649,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, we compared gene expression profiles (GEPs; Affymetrix HGU133 + 2.0) of 26 t(9;11)(p22;q23) patients with 42 other MLL-rearranged AML patients to identify differentially expressed genes. IGSF4, a cell-cell adhesion molecule, was found to be highly expressed in t(9;11)(p22;q23) patients, which was confirmed by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and Western blot. IGSF4 expression within t(9;11)(p22;q23) patients was 4.9 times greater in French-American-British morphology classification (FAB)-M5 versus other FAB-types (P = .001). Methylation status investigation showed that high IGSF4-expressing t(9;11)(p22;q23) patients with FAB-M5 have no promoter hypermethylation, whereas all other cases do. Cell-line incubation with demethylating agent decitabine resulted in promoter demethylation and increased expression of IGSF4. Down-regulation of IGSF4 by siRNA did not affect proliferation or drug sensitivity. In a cohort of 79 MLL-rearranged AML cases, we show significant better overall survival for cases with high IGSF4 expression (5-year overall survival 0.70 vs 0.37, P = .03) In conclusion, we identified IGSF4 overexpression to be discriminative for t(9;11)(p22;q23) patients with FAB-M5, regulated partially by promoter methylation and resulting in survival benefit.","[""Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Erasmus MC/Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2010 Nov 2.,"The rules governing natural killer (NK)-cell education in the allogeneic environment created by unrelated hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT) are still largely elusive, especially in an unrelated donor setting. NK-cell inhibitory receptors for self-human leukocyte antigen (HLA) play a central role in the acquisition or maintenance of NK-cell functional competence. Therefore, the responsiveness of different NK-cell subsets was assessed as a function of their expression or absence of expression of self-HLA-specific inhibitory receptors, in a large cohort (n = 60) of unrelated HSCT recipients. A fully effective NK-cell education process was achieved within the first year after allogeneic HSCT and lasted for at least 3 years thereafter. In addition, HLA-mismatched HSCT led to a stable education pattern that was determined by the donor's HLA ligands. These data suggest that the NK cell's education partner could be of hematopoietic rather than extrahematopoietic origin. This donor-ligand-driven NK-cell education model would suggest a sustained graft-versus-leukemia effect after HLA-mismatched HSCT.","['Inserm, Paris, France.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2010 Nov 2.,"Expression of microRNAs, a new class of noncoding RNAs that hybridize to target messenger RNA and regulate their translation into proteins, has been recently demonstrated to be altered in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Distinctive patterns of increased expression and/or silencing of multiple microRNAs (microRNA signatures) have been associated with specific cytogenetic and molecular subsets of AML. Changes in the expression of several microRNAs altered in AML have been shown to have functional relevance in leukemogenesis, with some microRNAs acting as oncogenes and others as tumor suppressors. Both microRNA signatures and a single microRNA (ie, miR-181a) have been shown to supply prognostic information complementing that gained from cytogenetics, gene mutations, and altered gene expression. Moreover, it has been demonstrated experimentally that antileukemic effects can be achieved by modulating microRNA expression by pharmacologic agents and/or increasing low endogenous levels of microRNAs with tumor suppressor function by synthetic microRNA oligonucleotides, or down-regulating high endogenous levels of leukemogenic microRNAs by antisense oligonucleotides (antagomirs). Therefore, it is reasonable to predict the development of novel microRNA-based therapeutic approaches in AML. We review herein results of current studies analyzing changes of microRNA expression in AML and discuss their potential biologic, diagnostic, and prognostic relevance.","['Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, 460 West 12th Avenue, Columbus, OH 43210, USA. guido.marcucci@osumc.edu']","['U10 CA101140/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA140158/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA102031/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA16058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA102031/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA101140/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3056468,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2010 Nov 2.,"Mutation at the R132 residue of isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1), frequently found in gliomas and acute myelogenous leukemia, creates a neoenzyme that produces 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) from alpha-ketoglutarate (alpha-KG). We sought to therapeutically exploit this neoreaction in mutant IDH1 cells that require alpha-KG derived from glutamine. Glutamine is converted to glutamate by glutaminase and further metabolized to alpha-KG. Therefore, we inhibited glutaminase with siRNA or the small molecule inhibitor bis-2-(5-phenylacetamido-1,2,4-thiadiazol-2-yl)ethyl sulfide (BPTES) and found slowed growth of glioblastoma cells expressing mutant IDH1 compared with those expressing wild-type IDH1. Growth suppression of mutant IDH1 cells by BPTES was rescued by adding exogenous alpha-KG.

Epub 2010 Nov 2.,"Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients treated with imatinib develop frequent resistance generally due to a point mutation. Recently, large rearrangements of abl sequence have also been described. In this study, we focused on the complete deletion of exon 7. We screened for bcr-abl(delexon7) in 63 resistant patients by high-resolution melting (HRM) analysis and direct sequencing. Moreover, we analyzed expression of abl(delexon7) and bcr-abl(delexon7) in 17 CML patients at diagnosis, 32 patients at resistance, and 20 negative controls by quantitative PCR or fragment length analysis. bcr-abl(delexon7) was detected on 34 (54%) among 63 resistant patients by HRM, showing an increase in the sensitivity of screening, because only 3.2% could be detected by direct sequencing. This deletion was not associated with a point mutation (P = 0.3362). In addition, abl(delexon7) was found in all tested samples with the same pattern of expression, suggesting an alternative splicing mechanism. In the bcr-abl component, there was no statistical difference between CML patients at diagnosis and resistant patients (P = 0.2815) as regarding bcr-abl(delexon7) proportion, thus arguing against involvement of deletion in resistance. Moreover, among two patients harboring bcr-abl(delexon7) at diagnosis, one experienced a complete disappearance of this transcript, and the other decreased >75% at resistance. In conclusion, bcr-abl(delexon7) is frequently observed in CML patients when using sensitive techniques. It seems to be the result of an alternative splicing mechanism and to be independent from the occurrence of resistance.","['Department of Clinical Cytology and Cytogenetics, Nimes University Hospital, Nimes, France.']",,,,,['(c)2010 AACR.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the mechanisms by which DAC induces antiproliferation via these processes and how they are interconnected remain unclear. In this study, we found that a clinically relevant concentration of DAC triggered erythroid and megakaryocytic differentiation in the human chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) K-562 and MEG-01 cell lines, respectively. In addition, cells showed a marked increase in cell size in both cell lines and a more adhesive cell profile for MEG-01. Furthermore, DAC treatment induced cellular senescence and autophagy as shown by beta-galactosidase staining and by autophagosome formation, respectively. After prolonged DAC treatment, phosphatidyl serine exposure, nuclear morphology analysis, and caspase cleavage revealed an activation of mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis in CML cells. This activation was accompanied by a decrease of anti-apoptotic proteins and an increase of calpain activity. Finally, we showed that combinatory treatment of relatively resistant CML with DAC and either conventional apoptotic inducers or with an histone deacetylase inhibitor increased synergistically apoptosis. We therefore conclude that induction of differentiation, senescence, and autophagy in CML are a key in cell sensitization and DAC-induced apoptosis.","['Laboratoire de Biologie Moleculaire et Cellulaire du Cancer, Hopital Kirchberg, 9 rue Edward Steichen, Luxembourg, Luxembourg.']",,,,,['Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

It is a highly heterogeneous disease, and can be divided roughly into indolent and progressive stages based on classic clinical markers. Immunoglobin heavy chain variable region (IgVH) mutational status was found to be associated with patient survival outcome, and biomarkers linked to the IgVH status has been a focus in the CLL prognosis research field. However, biomarkers highly correlated with IgVH mutational status which can accurately predict the survival outcome are yet to be discovered. RESULTS: In this paper, we investigate the use of gene co-expression network analysis to identify potential biomarkers for CLL. Specifically we focused on the co-expression network involving ZAP70, a well characterized biomarker for CLL. We selected 23 microarray datasets corresponding to multiple types of cancer from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and used the frequent network mining algorithm CODENSE to identify highly connected gene co-expression networks spanning the entire genome, then evaluated the genes in the co-expression network in which ZAP70 is involved. We then applied a set of feature selection methods to further select genes which are capable of predicting IgVH mutation status from the ZAP70 co-expression network. CONCLUSIONS: We have identified a set of genes that are potential CLL prognostic biomarkers IL2RB, CD8A, CD247, LAG3 and KLRK1, which can predict CLL patient IgVH mutational status with high accuracies. Their prognostic capabilities were cross-validated by applying these biomarker candidates to classify patients into different outcome groups using a CLL microarray datasets with clinical information.","['Department of Biomedical Informatics, The Ohio State University, OH, USA. jie.zhang@osumc.edu']","['R01 CA141090/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '2P01CA081534-07A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1R01CA134232-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1R01CA141090-0109/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2967746,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Numerous techniques exist that can be used to develop networks of co-expressed or otherwise related genes and clinical features. Such techniques can also be used to create formalized knowledge collections based upon the information incumbent to ontologies and domain literature. However, reports of integrative approaches that bridge such networks to create systems-level models of disease or wellness are notably lacking in the contemporary literature. RESULTS: In response to the preceding gap in knowledge and practice, we report upon a prototypical series of experiments that utilize multi-modal approaches to network induction. These experiments are intended to elicit meaningful and significant biomarker-phenotype complexes spanning multiple levels of granularity. This work has been performed in the experimental context of a large-scale clinical and basic science data repository maintained by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) funded Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Research Consortium. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that it is computationally tractable to link orthogonal networks of genes, clinical features, and conceptual knowledge to create multi-dimensional models of interrelated biomarkers and phenotypes. Further, our results indicate that such systems-level models contain interrelated bio-molecular and clinical markers capable of supporting hypothesis discovery and testing. Based on such findings, we propose a conceptual model intended to inform the cross-linkage of the results of such methods. This model has as its aim the identification of novel and knowledge-anchored biomarker-phenotype complexes.","['Department of Biomedical Informatics, The Ohio State University, 3190 Graves Hall, 333 West 10th Avenue, 43210, Columbus, Ohio, USA. philip.payne@osumc.edu']","['1R01CA134232-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '2 P01CA081534-07A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2967744,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The task requires an integrated analysis of genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data and gene expression data, raising a new computational challenge due to the tremendous size of data. RESULTS: We develop a method to identify eQTLs. The method represents eQTLs as information flux between genetic variants and transcripts. We use information theory to simultaneously interrogate SNP and gene expression data, resulting in a Transcriptional Information Map (TIM) which captures the network of transcriptional information that links genetic variations, gene expression and regulatory mechanisms. These maps are able to identify both cis- and trans- regulating eQTLs. The application on a dataset of leukemia patients identifies eQTLs in the regions of the GART, PCP4, DSCAM, and RIPK4 genes that regulate ADAMTS1, a known leukemia correlate.

BLV provirus remains integrated in cellular genomes, even in the absence of detectable BLV antibodies. Therefore, to understand the mechanism of BLV-induced leukemogenesis and carry out the selection of BLV-infected animals, a detailed evaluation of changes in proviral load throughout the course of disease in BLV-infected cattle is required. The aim of this study was to develop a new quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method using Coordination of Common Motifs (CoCoMo) primers to measure the proviral load of known and novel BLV variants in clinical animals. RESULTS: Degenerate primers were designed from 52 individual BLV long terminal repeat (LTR) sequences identified from 356 BLV sequences in GenBank using the CoCoMo algorithm, which has been developed specifically for the detection of multiple virus species. Among 72 primer sets from 49 candidate primers, the most specific primer set was selected for detection of BLV LTR by melting curve analysis after real-time PCR amplification. An internal BLV TaqMan probe was used to enhance the specificity and sensitivity of the assay, and a parallel amplification of a single-copy host gene (the bovine leukocyte antigen DRA gene) was used to normalize genomic DNA. The assay is highly specific, sensitive, quantitative and reproducible, and was able to detect BLV in a number of samples that were negative using the previously developed nested PCR assay. The assay was also highly effective in detecting BLV in cattle from a range of international locations. Finally, this assay enabled us to demonstrate that proviral load correlates not only with BLV infection capacity as assessed by syncytium formation, but also with BLV disease progression. CONCLUSIONS: Using our newly developed BLV-CoCoMo-qPCR assay, we were able to detect a wide range of mutated BLV viruses. CoCoMo algorithm may be a useful tool to design degenerate primers for quantification of proviral load for other retroviruses including HTLV and human immunodeficiency virus type 1.","['Viral Infectious Diseases Unit, RIKEN, 2-1 Hirosawa, Wako, Saitama 351-0198, Japan.']",,PMC2988707,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2010 Nov 2.,"Evading immune surveillance is one of the common hallmarks of cancer. Herein we describe two major evasion mechanisms in lymphoma, focusing on regulatory T (Treg) cells and C-C chemokine receptor 4 (CCR4) expressed on these cells. First, the tumor cells themselves function as Treg cells, characterized by expression of CCR4, contributing to tumor survival by downregulating host immunity. Second, CCR4 ligands are produced by tumor cells, which attract other CCR4(+) Treg cells to the vicinity of the tumor. CCR4(+) adult T-cell leukemia//lymphoma is an example of the former phenomenon, and Hodgkin lymphoma of the latter, for which an almost identical immunopathogenesis has been reported in many types of cancer. Awareness of the importance of CCR4 allows the rational design of more effective cancer treatments. Accordingly, we have developed a defucosylated anti-CCR4 mAb, the first therapeutic agent targeting CCR4 to be used clinically for cancer. The therapeutic anti-CCR4 mAb represents a promising treatment method for patients with CCR4(+) neoplasms by directly killing the cancer cells, but could also be used as a novel treatment strategy for many types of CCR4(-) cancers to overcome the suppressive effect of CCR4(+) Treg cells.","['Department of Medical Oncology and Immunology, Nagoya City University Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Mizuho-ku, Nagoya, Japan.']",,,,,['(c) 2010 Japanese Cancer Association.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

According to experimental data on NOD-SCID mice, leukemic stem cells are characterized by a CD34+/CD38- surface profile and account for 1 in 10(3) to 1 in 10(6) of the total amount of leukemic cells. The available knowledge about leukemic stem cells (LSC) has arisen the question as to whether some targeting of LSC is achieved by current treatments; the answer is dubitative at best, with the possible exception of arsenic trioxide in promyelocytic leukemia. On the other side, the unsatisfactory results in the treatment of many hematological neoplasms has prompted many research groups to find out whether direct targeting of LSC, possibly in its niche, would result in an improvement in cure rates. This approach implies the identification of LSC specific markers, clearly distinct from their normal counterpart in order to spare normal hematopoietic stem cells. Adhesion/surface antigens, metabolic pathways involved in LSC survival and renewal, telomerase, commonly mutated genes and epigenetic phenomena have been investigated as candidate targets for newer therapeutic strategies. So far, most of the possibly effective agents have been studied in experimental models only. FLT-3 inhibitors account for a notable exception since they have resulted effective in vivo in AML with mutated, but not over expressed, FLT-3. A main task for the future is to find out whether some common LSC specific markers would be identifiable in a substantial proportion of AML cases, or whether each AML case shows a unique fingerprint of markers. In the latter event, targeting of LSC could result in an arduous task.","['Hematology 1-CTMO, fondazione IRCCS Ca Granda Ospedale Maggiore Paliclinico, Milan, Italy.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We describe 2 patients, 1 with acute myeloid leukaemia in remission and the other with CML in accelerated phase, in whom severe intracranial thrombotic complications unexpectedly developed: blindness in the former and brain stem damage with deep unconsciousness in the latter. During already ongoing cytostatic treatment both of them recovered dramatically, which seemed to have a temporal relationship to the reduction of their platelet counts.

Lymphoma/leukemia classification has led the way in the number of antibodies used in IHC algorithmic diagnostic approaches to distinguish more than 40 diseases. As the era of genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and targeted pathway therapeutics unfolds-and as infusion of federal funds to programs such as Accelerating Clinical Trials of Novel Oncologic PathWays (ACTNOW) requires that correlative biomarker assays be performed in Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA)-certified IHC laboratories-we face changes and challenges for the future. OBJECTIVE: To discuss the laboratory, pertinent daily diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic uses of IHC, and future directions and challenges. DATA SOURCES: Recent literature review and ongoing current activities in our laboratory and institution. CONCLUSIONS: Meticulous attention at the microscope by expert subspecialty pathologists using ancillary methods is important in making correct diagnoses. Awareness of the literature and interactions with our research colleagues, including clinical, basic, and translational scientists, continue to expand our insights into and understanding of complex diseases; this will ultimately provide prognostic information to assist in appropriate clinical management of our patients and development of new targeted or combination therapies.

Inhibition of telomerase activity is a powerful strategy for cancer therapy; however, the potential molecular signals following telomerase suppression are still not clear. Promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) is an essential component of PML nuclear bodies and a tumor suppressor in bladder cancer. In this study, using mutant human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) or shRNA to inhibit telomerase activity, we found telomerase suppression increased the expression of PML and resulted in its translocation to the nucleus in bladder cancer T24 cells. Additionally, we found that p53 was recruited into nucleus and colocalized with PML after telomerase suppression. Subsequently, there was a decrease in cell growth in vitro and in vivo and an increase in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Furthermore, we showed here that PML is indispensable for p53 nuclear translocation and p21 induction after telomerase inhibition. Therefore, our data indicate that suppression of telomerase could activate the PML-dependent p53 signaling pathway and inhibit bladder cancer cell growth, and also provide new insight into the potential crosstalk between PML and hTERT in bladder cancer cells.","[""Department of Urology, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an 710061, Shaanxi, PR China.""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The unique presentation of bilateral proptosis and bilateral temporal swelling in AML is being reported. CASE REPORT: A 6-year-old girl presented with low-grade fever, progressively increasing bitemporal swelling and bilateral proptosis. Contrast Enhanced Computed Tomographic (CECT) images revealed enhancing infiltrates occupying the lateral orbital wall, causing proptosis. The infiltrate extended toward the bilateral temporal fossae beneath the temporalis muscle and extradurally beneath the frontal and temporal bones. A high total leucocytic count with immature and deformed cells and, Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology (FNAC) from the temporal swelling, the bone marrow aspirate and biopsy showing leukemic blast cells confirmed the diagnosis of AML. Chemotherapy brought about remission of the disease. CONCLUSIONS: To the best of the authors' knowledge, simultaneous presence of both bilateral proptosis and bitemporal swellings have not been previously reported in AML.

Clinical features of headache, altered consciousness, focal neurological deficit, and seizures developing during or immediately after treatment with L-asparaginase should alert the treating physician to the possibility of CSVT. Immediate imaging of the brain should be done using CT and MRI and the veins should be visualized noninvasively by CT and MR venography.

Venous infarcts with and without hemorrhage were seen on CT in one patient and the empty delta sign was seen after contrast injection; however, the early changes were missed by CT. MRI detected dural sinus thrombosis relatively earlier in another patient, while the CT findings were equivocal; in this patient, contrast-enhanced MRI showed the empty delta sign and MR venography confirmed absent flow in the superior sagittal sinus, which was diagnostic of sinus thrombosis.

Current approaches in Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) research focus on identifying new molecular targets to improve outcome for patients with a dismal prognosis. In this light phosphoproteomics seems to hold great promise for the identification of proteins suitable for targeted therapy. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We employed Reverse Phase Protein Microarrays to identify aberrantly activated proteins in 118 pediatric B-cell precursor (BCP)-ALL patients. Signal transduction pathways were assayed for activation/expression status of 92 key signalling proteins. We observed an increased activation/expression of several pathways involved in cell proliferation in poor clinical prognosis patients. MLL-rearranged tumours revealed BCL-2 hyperphosphorylation through AMPK activation, which indicates that AMPK could provide a functional role in inhibiting apoptosis in MLL-rearranged patients, and could be considered as a new potential therapeutic target. Second, in patients with poor clinical response to prednisone we observed the up-modulation of LCK activity with respect to patients with good response. This tyrosine-kinase can be down-modulated with clinically used inhibitors, thus modulating LCK activity could be considered for further studies as a new additional therapy for prednisone-resistant patients. Further we also found an association between high levels of CYCLIN E and relapse incidence. Moreover, CYCLIN E is more expressed in early relapsed patients, who usually show an unfavourable prognosis. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We conclude that functional protein pathway activation mapping revealed specific deranged signalling networks in BCP-ALL that could be potentially modulated to produce a better clinical outcome for patients resistant to standard-of-care therapies.","['Oncohematology Laboratory, Department of Pediatrics, University of Padova, Padova, Italy. benedetta.accordi@unipd.it']",,PMC2958847,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Defects in the orderly pattern of hematopoietic cell division and differentiation can lead to leukemia, myeloproliferative disorders, or marrow failure; however, the factors that control this pattern are incompletely understood. Geminin is an unstable regulatory protein that regulates the extent of DNA replication and is thought to coordinate cell division with cell differentiation. Here, we set out to determine the function of Geminin in hematopoiesis by deleting the Geminin gene (Gmnn) from mouse bone marrow cells. This severely perturbed the pattern of blood cell production in all 3 hematopoietic lineages (erythrocyte, megakaryocyte, and leukocyte). Red cell production was virtually abolished, while megakaryocyte production was greatly enhanced. Leukocyte production transiently decreased and then recovered. Stem and progenitor cell numbers were preserved, and Gmnn(-/-) HSCs successfully reconstituted hematopoiesis in irradiated mice. CD34(+) Gmnn(-/-) leukocyte precursors displayed DNA overreplication and formed extremely small granulocyte and monocyte colonies in methylcellulose. While cultured Gmnn(-/-) mega-karyocyte-erythrocyte precursors did not form erythroid colonies, they did form greater than normal numbers of megakaryocyte colonies. Gmnn(-/-) megakaryocytes and erythroblasts had normal DNA content. These data led us to postulate that Geminin regulates the relative production of erythrocytes and megakaryocytes from megakaryocyte-erythrocyte precursors by a replication-independent mechanism.","['Feinberg Cardiovascular Research Institute, Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, Illinois, USA.']",,PMC2993593,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The median survival of patients with the Grade IV glioma, glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), is shorter than 15 months and the current first-line therapies for this devastating disease have only a palliative effect. The cancer stem cell hypothesis has recently attracted a great deal of attention, owing to the promise of a novel cellular target for the treatment of tumors including GBM. Recent studies have demonstrated that existence of cancer stem cells in brain tumors (BTSC) accounts, at least in part, for the intractability of malignant glioma. From the therapeutic standpoint, characterization of the mechanism for tumor initiation and maintenance of the ""stem-like state"" of BTSC is crucial. However, multiple heterogeneous subtypes of cancer stem cells have recently been identified from malignant glioma, making the idea of cancer stem cell complicated. In addition, in some cancer types (e.g. melanoma), a considerable proportion of tumor cells may possess the stem cell property, indicating cancer stem cells may not be a rare cell population in tumors, at least in some organs. Based on the extensive genetic and epigenetic characterization of tumor growth mechanisms, various molecularly-targeted therapies have already been applied for patients, demonstrating a varying degree of success in cancer treatment. A significant improvement in patient prognosis was achieved in several cancer types including leukemia and breast cancer. It is no doubt that continuous effort is required to bring hope for patients with malignant glioma. In this study, we summarize the recent findings and approaches in the cancer stem cell field, mainly focusing on malignant glioma stem cells, and also describe potential future directions in this area.","['Department of Neurological Surgery, The Ohio State University, Ohio, USA.

Epub 2010 Nov 1.,"To characterize mechanisms of CTL inhibition within an ocular tumor microenvironment, tumor-specific CTLs were transferred into mice with tumors developing within the anterior chamber of the eye or skin. Ocular tumors were resistant to CTL transfer therapy whereas skin tumors were sensitive. CTLs infiltrated ocular tumors at higher CTL/tumor ratios than in skin tumors and demonstrated comparable ex vivo effector function to CTLs within skin tumors indicating that ocular tumor progression was not due to decreased CTL accumulation or inhibited CTL function within the eye. CD11b(+)Gr-1(+)F4/80(-) cells predominated within ocular tumors, whereas skin tumors were primarily infiltrated by CD11b(+)Gr-1(-)F4/80(+) macrophages (Ms), suggesting that myeloid derived suppressor cells may contribute to ocular tumor growth. However, CD11b(+) myeloid cells isolated from either tumor site suppressed CTL activity in vitro via NO production. Paradoxically, the regression of skin tumors by CTL transfer therapy required NO production by intratumoral Ms indicating that NO-producing intratumoral myeloid cells did not suppress the effector phase of CTL. Upon CTL transfer, tumoricidal concentrations of NO were only produced by skin tumor-associated Ms though ocular tumor-associated Ms demonstrated comparable expression of inducible NO synthase protein suggesting that NO synthase enzymatic activity was compromised within the eye. Correspondingly, in vitro-activated Ms limited tumor growth when co-injected with tumor cells in the skin but not in the eye. In conclusion, the decreased capacity of Ms to produce NO within the ocular microenvironment limits CTL tumoricidal activity allowing ocular tumors to progress.","['Graduate Program in Immunology, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA 15213, USA.']","['R01 EY018355-04/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States', 'K23064396/PHS HHS/United States', 'P30-EY08098/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 EY018355/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 EY008098/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3152256,['NIHMS310584'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2010 Nov 1.,"Regulators of apoptosis in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) have been extensively studied and are considered excellent therapeutic targets. Apoptosis repressor with caspase recruitment domain (ARC), an antiapoptotic protein originally found to be involved in apoptosis of cardiac cells, was recently demonstrated to be overexpressed in several solid tumors. To assess its importance in AML, we profiled ARC expression in 511 newly diagnosed AML patients using a validated robust reverse-phase protein array and correlated ARC levels with clinical outcomes. ARC was variably expressed in samples from patients with AML. ARC level was not associated with cytogenetic groups or with FLT-3 mutation status. However, patients with low or medium ARC protein levels had significantly better outcomes than those with high ARC levels: longer overall survival (median, 53.9 or 61.6 vs 38.9 weeks, P = .0015) and longer remission duration (median, 97.6 or 44.7 vs 31.1 weeks, P = .0007). Multivariate analysis indicated that ARC was a statistically significant independent predictor of survival in AML (P = .00013). Inhibition of ARC promoted apoptosis and sensitized cytosine arabinoside-induced apoptosis in OCI-AML3 cells. These results suggest that ARC expression levels are highly prognostic in AML and that ARC is a potential therapeutic target in AML.","['Section of Molecular Hematology and Therapy, Department of Leukemia, University of Texas M.

Epub 2010 Nov 1.,"The Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway is critical for cell growth and differentiation during embryogenesis and early development. While it is mostly quiescent in adults, inappropriate reactivation of the Hh pathway has been shown to be involved in the development of cancer. A number of tumor types rely on overexpression of Hh ligands to activate the pathway in a paracrine manner from the tumor to the surrounding stroma. Alternatively, Hh ligands may act on cancer stem cells in some hematopoietic cancers, such as chronic myelogenous leukemia. However, the role of the Hh pathway is best established in tumors, such as basal cell carcinoma and medulloblastoma, where the pathway is activated via mutations. Understanding the contribution of Hh signaling in these various tumor types will be critical to the development and use of agents targeting this pathway in the clinic. We review here the activity of clinical inhibitors of the Hh pathway, including GDC-0449, a small molecule inhibitor of Smoothened (SMO).","['Genentech Inc, 1 DNA Way, South San Francisco, CA 94080, USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a nonrandomized, off-label, pilot, phase I/II study of alemtuzumab monotherapy in patients with MDS who were judged likely to respond to IST based on the following criteria: HLA-DR15-negative patients whose age plus the number of months of RBC transfusion dependence (RCTD) was less than 58; and HLA-DR15-positive patients whose age plus RCTD was less than 72. In total, 121 patients with MDS were screened, of whom 32 met eligibility criteria to receive alemtuzumab 10 mg/d intravenously for 10 days. Primary end points were hematologic responses at 3, 6, and 12 months after alemtuzumab. RESULTS: Seventeen (77%) of 22 evaluable intermediate-1 patients and four (57%) of seven evaluable intermediate-2 patients responded to treatment with a median time to response of 3 months. Four of seven evaluable responders with cytogenetic abnormalities before treatment had normal cytogenetics by 1 year after treatment. Five (56%) of nine responding patients evaluable at 12 months had normal blood counts, and seven (78%) of nine patients were transfusion independent. CONCLUSION: Alemtuzumab is safe and active in MDS and may be an attractive alternative to ATG in selected patients likely to respond to IST.","['Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, Bldg 10 CRC 4-5230, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA. sloande@nhlbi.nih.gov']",['Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],PMC3020689,,,,['ClinicalTrials.gov/NCT00217594'],,['J Clin Oncol. 2011 Dec 20;29(36):4841-2; author reply 4842.

Epub 2010 Nov 1.,"Resistance of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) to tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate (IM) is most often due to point mutations in the Bcr-Abl fusion gene. T315I mutation (resulting in substitution of Ile for a Thr residue at the ""gatekeeper"" position 315) raises particular concern, because it also provides resistance to second-generation kinase inhibitors already approved for clinical use (nilotinib and dasatinib). Much effort is therefore focused on alternative molecular-based strategies. Previous studies proved that binding to 14-3-3 scaffolding proteins leads to cytoplasmic compartmentalization and suppression of proapoptotic and antiproliferative signals associated with Bcr-Abl protein kinase, hence contributing to leukemic clone expansion. Here we investigated the effect of 14-3-3 inhibition disruption on hematopoietic cells expressing the IM-sensitive wild type Bcr-Abl and the IM-resistant T315I mutation. Using a virtual screening protocol and docking simulations, we identified a nonpeptidic inhibitor of 14-3-3, named BV02, that exhibits a remarkable cytotoxicity against both cell types. c-Abl release from 14-3-3sigma, promoting its relocation to nuclear compartment (where it triggers transcription of p73-dependent proapoptotic genes) and to mitochondrial membranes (where it induces the loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential) combined with c-Abl enhanced association with caspase 9 (a critical step of sequential caspase activation further contributing to c-Abl pro-apoptotic function) has a prominent role in the effect of BV02 on Bcr-Abl-expressing cells. In conclusion, BV02 may be considered as a treatment option for CML and, in particular, for more advanced phases of the disease that developed IM resistance as a consequence of Bcr-Abl point mutations.","['Dipartimento di Ematologia e Scienze Oncologiche Lorenzo e Ariosto Seragnoli, Policlinico S.

Understanding the opposite effects of mTOR activation on HSCs versus leukemia-initiating cells could improve antileukemia therapies. We found that the depletion of Pten-deficient HSCs was not caused by oxidative stress and could not be blocked by N-acetyl-cysteine. Instead, Pten deletion induced, and rapamycin attenuated, the expression of p16(Ink4a) and p53 in HSCs, and p19(Arf) and p53 in other hematopoietic cells. p53 suppressed leukemogenesis and promoted HSC depletion after Pten deletion. p16(Ink4a) also promoted HSC depletion but had a limited role suppressing leukemogenesis. p19(Arf) strongly suppressed leukemogenesis but did not deplete HSCs. Secondary mutations attenuated this tumor suppressor response in some leukemias that arose after Pten deletion. mTOR activation therefore depletes HSCs by a tumor suppressor response that is attenuated by secondary mutations in leukemogenic clones.","['Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Center for Stem Cell Biology, Life Sciences Institute, and Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA.']","['HHMI/Howard Hughes Medical Institute/United States', 'P30 CA046592/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA46592/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2995996,['HHMIMS252262'],,['Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2010 Oct 29.,"The important role of insulin-like growth factor binding protein 7 (IGFBP7) as a tumor suppressor in solid tumors has been revealed in several studies. Interestingly, in a recent study IGFBP7 was also shown to be aberrantly expressed in acute leukemia. Moreover, in acute T-lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), high IGFBP7 expression predicts primary therapy resistance. In order to elucidate the mechanisms underlying aberrant IGFBP7 expression, we used pyrosequencing technology to investigate the DNA methylation of IGFBP7 in 109 T-ALL patient samples. Aberrant methylation was shown and hypomethylation was associated with an early immunophenotype and co-expression of the stem cell markers CD117 (P < 0.001) and CD34 (P < 0.001). In concordance, gene expression profiles of 86 T-ALL patients revealed upregulation of stem cell markers (CD34 and CD133) as well as genes associated with poor outcome and pathogenesis of leukemia (MN1, BAALC, FLT3) in the high IGFBP7 expression group. In conclusion, aberrant IGFBP7 expression is regulated by DNA methylation in acute leukemia. Hypomethylation of the gene is likely to characterize an immature and a more malignant subtype of the disease.","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Campus Benjamin Franklin, Charite, University Hospital Berlin, Berlin, Germany.']",,,,,['(c) 2010 Japanese Cancer Association.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2010 Oct 12.,"BPR0C261 is a synthetic small molecule compound cytotoxic against human cancer cells and active prolonging the lifespan of leukemia mice. In the present study, we further investigated the mechanisms of its anticancer action and found that BPR0C261 inhibited microtubule polymerization through interacting with the colchicine binding sites on tubulins, disrupted microtubule arrangement and caused cell cycle arrest at G(2)/M phase in cancer cells. BPR0C261 also inhibited the clonogenic growths of cancer cells and showed cytotoxicity against human cervical cancer cells of multidrug-resistant phenotype. In addition, BPR0C261 concentration-dependently inhibited the proliferation and migration of HUVECs and disrupted the endothelial capillary-like tube formations in HUVEC and rat aorta ring cultures. Given orally, BPR0C261 inhibited angiogenesis in s.c. implanted Matrigel plugs in mice. Notably, its IC(50) values against the endothelial cell growths were approximately 10-fold lower than those against the cancer cells. It was found orally absorbable in mice and showed a good oral bioavailability (43%) in dogs. BPR0C261 permeated through the human intestinal Caco-2 cell monolayer, suggesting oral availability in humans. Orally absorbed BPR0C261 distributed readily into the s.c. xenografted tumors in nude mice in which the tumor tissue levels of BPR0C261 were found oral dose-dependent. BPR0C261 showed in vivo activities against human colorectal, gastric, and nasopharyngeal tumors in nude mice. Most interestingly, the combination of BPR0C261 plus cisplatin synergistically prolonged the lifespans of mice inoculated with murine leukemia cells. Thus, BPR0C261 is a novel orally active tubulin-binding antitumor agent with antimitotic, apoptosis-inducing, and vasculature disrupting activities.","['Division of Biotechnology and Pharmaceutical Research, National Health Research Institutes, Zhunan, Taiwan.']",,,,,['(c) 2010 Japanese Cancer Association.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This paper addresses the question of whether it can be used as an S-phase marker, when the non-chromatin-bound form of the protein is removed by pepsin treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cytofluorometric measurements were carried out after immunofluorescence staining of PCNA and counterstaining of DNA. S-phase fraction was determined with the help of windows on PCNA versus DNA scattergrams, or mathematically from DNA histograms. RESULTS: S-phase fractions obtained using the two methods correlated well, but did not always agree, exact discrepancies depending on the mathematical model used for histogram analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Determination of S-phase fractions with the help of PCNA immunofluorescence staining is possible, and probably more reliable than calculation of S-fractions from DNA histograms. It thus offers an alternative to assays involving BrdU labelling in vivo.","['Department of Medical Radiobiology, Faculty of Medicine, University Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany. zoelzer@zsf.jcu.cz']",,PMC6496114,,,['(c) 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to investigate the role of USP22 and the association with its potential targets in colorectal cancer (CRC). METHODS: We evaluated the implication of USP22 and the candidate targets, such as B-cell-specific murine leukemia virus integration site-1 (BMI-1), cellular homolog of avian myelocytomatosis virus oncogene (c-Myc), cyclin D2, inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4 (p16INK4a), and an alternate reading frame product of the CDKN2A locus (p14ARF), in matched samples comprising carcinoma and adjacent non-cancerous mucosa from 82 patients with CRC using quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and immunostaining analyses. RESULTS: The USP22 mRNA expression in the CRC tissues was significantly higher than those in the non-cancerous mucosa tissues (P < 0.0001). Increased mRNA expression of USP22 was associated with advanced American Joint Committee on Cancer stage (P = 0.033) and high likelihood of therapy failure after radical resection (P < 0.0001). The Cox regression analysis revealed that the USP22 mRNA expression level was a significant factor for predicting prognosis (P < 0.0001). The statistical correlation analysis in mRNA levels showed that USP22 was strongly correlated with BMI-1 (r = 0.790, P < 0.0001), c-Myc (r = 0.528, P < 0.0001), and cyclin D2 (r = 0.657, P < 0.0001), but not p16INK4a (r = 0.103, P = 0.358) or p14ARF (r = -0.039, P = 0.731). CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that activation of USP22 correlates with CRC progression and therapy failure. Additionally, the oncogenic role of USP22 in the progression of CRC can be mechanistically linked with BMI-1, c-Myc, and cyclin D2, but not with p16INK4a and p14ARF.","['Department of Colorectal Surgery, the Affiliated Tumor Hospital, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.']",,,,,"['(c) 2010 Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology Foundation and Blackwell', 'Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, adjuvant use of recombinant human granulocyte-colony stimulating factor may also increase the risk of t-MNs. There is clinical and biological overlap between t-MNs and high-risk de novo myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukaemia suggesting similar mechanisms of leukaemogenesis. Human studies and animal models point to a prominent role of genetic susceptibilty in the pathogenesis of t-MNs. Common genetic variants have been identified that modulate t-MN risk, and t-MNs have been observed in some cancer predisposition syndromes. In either case, establishing a leukaemic phenotype requires acquisition of somatic mutations - most likely induced by the cytotoxic treatment. Knowledge of the specific nature of the initiating exposure has allowed the identification of crucial pathogenetic mechanisms and for these to be modelled in vitro and in vivo. Prognosis of patients with t-MNs is dismal and at present, the only curative approach for the majority of these individuals is haematopoietic stem cell transplantation, which is characterized by high transplant-related mortality rates. Novel transplantation strategies using reduced intensity conditioning regimens as well as novel drugs - demethylating agents and targeted therapies - await clinical testing and may improve outcome. Ultimately, individual assessment of genetic risk factors may translate into tailored therapies and establish a strategy for reducing t-MN incidences without jeopardizing therapeutic success rates for the primary disorders.","['Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Haematology, Medical University of Graz, Graz, Austria. heinz.sill@medunigraz.at']",,PMC3042191,,,"['(c) 2011 The Authors.

METHODS: 54 cases, consisting of 40 patients with acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) and 14 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) were included to the study, where further 34 healthy subjects were also recruited. Body mass index (BMI), triceps skin-fold thickness (TST), mid-arm circumference (MAC) and biochemistry tests were used for the assessment tools of malnutrition. RESULTS: When classified according to BMI, prevalence of malnutrition was 18.5% in all cases, 18% in newly-diagnosed cases, 20% in patients with remission and 16% without remission, and 5.8% in control group. No statistically significant difference was found between groups (p=0.47). Prevalence of malnutrition according to TST and MAC was not different in patient and control group (p=0.048), (p=0.37). Patients with malnutrition according to BMI had also significant malnutrition according to TST and MAC measurements (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence of malnutrition was seen at higher percentage in adult acute leukemia cases, which was increased during the course of treatment, and TST measurement was better in establishing malnutrition.","['Department of Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, Yuzuncu Yil University, Van, Turkey.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epidemiology studies strongly indicate that an increase in HTLV-1 virus load is an important factor during the onset of ATL. Therefore, inhibition of the growth/transmission of HTLV-1 infected cells is a promising strategy in preventing the disease. In our previous study, we revealed that arsenic trioxide (As2O3), a drug used to treat acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), exerts an inhibitory effect on syncytium formation between HTLV-1 infected cells and HeLa cells via suppression of HTLV-1 envelope protein gp46 expression at low concentrations. In this study, we analyze the mechanism of action of As2O3 using a proteomics approach. Our results suggest that down-regulation of gp46 might be related to As2O3-induced oxidation of the 71-kDa heat shock cognate protein (HSC70) and the 78-kDa glucose-regulated protein (BiP/GRP78). We postulate that AS2O3 exerts an inhibitory effect on HTLV-1 virus transmission via down-regulation of gp46-production, which might be caused by oxidative modification of various proteins such as chaperones.","['Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Proteomics, National Institute of Biomedical Innovation, Osaka, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are important mediators in apoptosis induced by various stimuli, including chemopreventive agents. The phosphotransferase c-JUN N-terminal kinase (JNK) has been shown to regulate apoptosis. In this study, we found that DADS-induced apoptosis in human leukemia HL-60 cells is mediated by ROS-activated JNK. The DADS-treated HL-60 cells showed a dose- and time-dependent decrease in cell viability and proliferation. Agarose gel electrophoresis of cells treated with 10.0 or 20.0 mg/L DADS for 24 h showed a characteristic ladder pattern in their DNA. Levels of DADS-induced ROS, as measured by 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) fluorescence, also showed dose- and time-dependent increases in HL-60 cells. Activity of JNK was induced by DADS in a dose-dependent manner; HL-60 cells exposed to 10.0 mg/L DADS for 8 h showed maximum levels of phosphorylated JNK, which decreased when exposed for additional 4h. In contrast, Sp600125, a specific inhibitor of JNK, blocked apoptosis of HL-60 cells exposed to DADS. N-Acetylcysteine (NAC), a known antioxidant, also decreased ROS generation, effectively blocked apoptosis, and decreased DADS-induced phosphorylated JNK levels. These results suggest that JNK is involved in DADS-induced ROS-mediated apoptosis in HL-60 cells.","['Cancer Research Institute, University of South China, Hengyang City, Hunan Province, China.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

No toxicities were observed in mice treated with Q39 at dose levels that 168 mg/kg. LD50 value was 257.8 mg/kg (95% confidence interval = 231.1-287.5 mg/kg), which was 3.3-fold higher than that of TPZ. For the plasma pharmacokinetic assessment, a balb/c nude mice bearing K562 leukemia cell xenografted model was introduced and dosed with Q39 intravenous (i.v.)(1.0 mg/kg). Rapid resolution liquid chromatography coupled with tanderm mass spectrometry quantitative detection method (RRLC-MS/MS) was used to quantitatively determine plasma concentration. The RRLC-MS/MS method was validated within the concentration range 25-2000 ng/mL, and the calibration curves were linear with correlation coefficients of > 0.999. Following intravenous administration to nude mice (1.0 mg/kg), plasma concentrations declined rapidly from 1063.3 microg/mL at 10 min to 81.5 microg/mL at 3h.

In 52 cats with chronic gingivostomatitis and 50 healthy age-matched control cats, the presence of FCV ribonucleic acid (RNA), and FHV deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (polymerase chain reaction [PCR] from oropharyngeal swabs), and B. henselae DNA (PCR from oropharyngeal swabs and blood), as well as FeLV antigen (serum), and antibodies against FCV, B. henselae, and FIV (serum) were examined. FCV RNA was significantly more common in cats with chronic gingivostomatitis (53.8%, p < 0.001) than in controls (14.0%); a significant difference was also found in the prevalence of antibodies to FCV between the cats with chronic gingivostomatitis (78.8%, p = 0.023) and controls (58.0%). Of the other infectious agents investigated, there was no significant difference in the prevalence between the cats with chronic gingivostomatitis and the controls.

The participants of this study were 90 mothers of children with leukaemia. The results revealed that the satisfaction level of the basic needs and role strain were the predictors of the depressive symptoms.

The targeted inactivation of oncogenes can be associated with tumor regression through the phenomenon of oncogene addiction. One of the most common oncogenic events in human cancer is the activation of the MYC oncogene. The inactivation of MYC may be a general and effective therapy for human cancer. Indeed, it has been experimentally shown that the inactivation of MYC can result in dramatic and sustained tumor regression in lymphoma, leukemia, osteosarcoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, squamous carcinoma, and pancreatic carcinoma through a multitude of mechanisms, including proliferative arrest, terminal differentiation, cellular senescence, induction of apoptosis, and the shutdown of angiogenesis. Cell-autonomous and cell-dependent mechanisms have both been implicated, and recent results suggest a critical role for autocrine factors, including thrombospondin-1 and TGF-beta. Hence, targeting the inactivation of MYC appears to elicit oncogene addiction and, thereby, tumor regression through both tumor cell-intrinsic and host-dependent mechanisms.","['Division of Oncology, Departments of Medicine and Pathology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.']","['R01 CA105102-06/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U56 CA112973/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA034233/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA114747-050002/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA089305/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA105102/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA089305-10/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA034233-260034/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA114747/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2965623,['NIHMS231739'],,,,,,,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['MYC', 'oncogene addiction', 'tumorigenesis']",,,,,,,,,,

This Neurogenesis occurs only in discrete regions of the adult brain: the subventricular zone (SVZ) and the subgranular zone (SGZ). In these areas, there are neural stem cells (NSCs), multipotent and selfrenewing, which are regulated by a number of molecules and signaling pathways that control their cell fate choices, survival and proliferation rates. It was believed that growth and morphogenic factors were the unique mediators that controlled NSCs in vivo. Recently, chemokines and cytokines have been identified as important regulators of NSCs functions. Some of the most studied immunological effectors are leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), and the chemokines MCP-1 and SDF-1. These substances exert a considerable regulation on proliferation, cell-fate choices, migration and survival of NSCs. Hence, the immune system is emerging as an important regulator of neurogenic niches in the adult brain, but further studies are necessary to fully establish the biological meaning of these neural effects.","['Neuroscience Laboratory, Psychology School, University of Colima, Colima, Mexico 28040.']","['K08 NS055851/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'K08 NS055851-01/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NS070024/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2964894,['NIHMS175214'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was nominated to the National Toxicology Program for study due to concern for adverse health effects associated with its chronic use as a dietary supplement by athletes (prior to the banning of its over the counter sales). In order to evaluate its subchronic and chronic toxicity, male and female F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice were administered androstenedione (98% pure) by gavage for 2 weeks, 3 months, or 2 years. Genetic toxicology studies were conducted in Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli, rat bone marrow cells, and mouse peripheral blood erythrocytes. 2-WEEK STUDY IN RATS: groups of five male and five female rats were administered 0, 1, 5, 10, 20, or 50 mg androstenedione/kg body weight in a 0.5% aqueous methylcellulose solution by gavage, 5 days per week for 12 days. All rats survived to the end of the study, and the mean body weights of dosed groups were similar to those of the vehicle control groups. The development of cytoplasmic vacuoles within centrilobular hepatocytes in male rats was the only treatment-related effect observed. 2-WEEK STUDY IN MICE: groups of five male and five female mice were administered 0, 1, 5, 10, 20, or 50 mg androstenedione/kg body weight in a 0.5% aqueous methylcellulose solution by gavage, 5 days per week for 12 days. One vehicle control female, one 20 mg/kg female, and one 50 mg/kg female died early due to gavage accidents. There were no significant chemical-related histopathological or mean body weight changes. 3-MONTH STUDY IN RATS: groups of 10 male and 10 female core study rats were administered 0, 1, 5, 10, 20, or 50 mg androstenedione/kg body weight in a 0.5% aqueous methylcellulose solution by gavage, 5 days per week for 14 weeks; additional groups of 10 male and 10 female clinical pathology study rats received the same doses for 23 days. All rats survived to the end of the study. The mean body weights of the 20 mg/kg female group was significantly greater than those of the vehicle control group and there was significant increased weight gain in the 1, 20, and 50 mg/kg female groups. Female thymus weights were significantly increased in the 20 and 50 mg/kg groups, which may be related to the increase in mean body weight. The numbers of sperm per mg cauda epididymis in the 10, 20, and 50 mg/kg male groups and the total number of sperm per cauda epididymis in 50 mg/kg males were significantly less than those of the vehicle controls. No treatment-related histological lesions were observed in males or females. 3-MONTH STUDY IN MICE: groups of 10 male and 10 female mice were administered 0, 1, 5, 10, 20, or 50 mg androstenedione/kg body weight in a 0.5% aqueous methylcellulose solution by gavage, 5 days per week for 14 weeks. Except for one 10 mg/kg female that died early due to a dosing accident, all mice survived to the end of the study. The mean body weights of dosed groups were similar to those of the vehicle control groups. The number of spermatids per mg testis and the total number of spermatids per testis in 20 mg/kg males were significantly greater than those of the vehicle controls. Sperm motility in 50 mg/kg males was significantly lower than that in the vehicle controls. The incidences of x-zone atrophy of the adrenal cortex, an androgen-sensitive endpoint, were significantly increased in females administered 5 mg/kg or greater. There were also significant decreases in the incidences of x-zone cytoplasmic vacuolization in 20 and 50 mg/kg females. The incidences of bone marrow hyperplasia were significantly increased in 5 and 50 mg/kg males. 2-YEAR STUDY IN RATS: groups of 50 male and 50 female rats were administered 0, 10, 20, or 50 mg androstenedione/kg body weight in a 0.5% aqueous methylcellulose solution by gavage, 5 days per week for at least 104 weeks. Survival of 10 mg/kg males was significantly greater than that of the vehicle controls. The mean body weights of 20 and 50 mg/kg females were greater than those of the vehicle controls after weeks 17 and 9, respectively. The incidences of mononuclear cell leukemia were significantly increased in 20 and 50 mg/kg females and significantly decreased in 20 and 50 mg/kg males. Incidences of alveolar/bronchiolar adenoma and alveolar/bronchiolar adenoma or carcinoma (combined) were significantly increased in 20 mg/kg males. The incidence of testicular interstitial cell adenoma (including bilateral) was significantly decreased in 50 mg/kg males. In females, the incidences of mammary gland fibroadenoma were significantly decreased in the 20 and 50 mg/kg groups, the incidences of mammary gland hyperplasia were significantly decreased in all dosed groups, and the incidences of mammary gland cyst were significantly decreased in the 10 and 50 mg/kg groups. In the liver of males, the incidences of basophilic focus in all dosed groups, the incidence of clear cell focus in the 20 mg/kg group, and the incidence of eosinophilic focus in the 50 mg/kg group were significantly increased. The incidences of pancreatic islet hyperplasia and atrophy of the exocrine pancreas were significantly increased in 50 mg/kg females. 2-YEAR STUDY IN MICE: groups of 50 male and 50 female mice were administered 0, 2 (females only), 10, 20 (males only), or 50 mg androstenedione/kg body weight in a 0.5% aqueous methylcellulose solution by gavage, 5 days per week for at least 104 weeks. Survival of dosed groups was similar to that of the vehicle control groups. Mean body weights of 10 and 50 mg/kg females were generally less than those of the vehicle controls after weeks 81 and 17, respectively. The incidences of hepatocellular adenoma in males and females were significantly increased in the 50 mg/kg groups. In females, the incidences of hepatocellular carcinoma were significantly increased in all dosed groups. Incidences of hepatocellular adenoma or carcinoma (combined) in males and females were significantly increased in the 50 mg/kg groups. Incidences of hepatoblastoma were marginally increased in dosed males. Incidences of multiple hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas were significantly increased in 10 and 50 mg/kg males, and there was an increased incidence of multiple hepatocellular adenomas in 50 mg/kg females. The incidence of eosinophilic focus was significantly increased in 50 mg/kg males, and the incidences of mixed cell focus and cytoplasmic vacuolization were significantly increased in 50 mg/kg females. There was a marginally increased incidence of pancreatic islet adenoma in 50 mg/kg males and in 10 and 50 mg/kg females, with an earlier day of first incidence in males. The incidences of clitoral gland hyperplasia and clitoral gland duct dilatation were significantly increased in 10 and 50 mg/kg females. The incidence of glomerular metaplasia of the kidney was significantly increased in 50 mg/kg females, and the incidences of cytoplasmic alteration of the submandibular salivary gland were significantly increased in all dosed female groups. The increased incidences of cytoplasmic alteration of the submandibular salivary gland and glomerular metaplasia of the kidney in female mice indicated a masculinizing effect from androstenedione treatment. In 50 mg/kg females, the incidence of malignant lymphoma was significantly decreased. GENETIC TOXICOLOGY: androstenedione was not mutagenic in either of two independent bacterial mutation assays conducted with and without exogenous metabolic activation. No significant increases in the frequencies of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes, indicators of chromosomal damage, were observed in bone marrow of male rats administered androstenedione by gavage once daily for 3 consecutive days. Results of a peripheral blood erythrocyte micronucleus test in mice, in which androstenedione was administered by gavage for 3 months, were negative in males but judged to be equivocal in females due to a small increase (twofold over background) in micronucleated normochromatic erythrocytes observed at the highest dose administered (50 mg/kg). CONCLUSIONS: under the conditions of these 2-year gavage studies, there was equivocal evidence of carcinogenic activity of androstenedione in male F344/N rats based on increased incidences of alveolar/bronchiolar adenoma and alveolar/bronchiolar adenoma or carcinoma (combined). There was equivocal evidence of carcinogenic activity of androstenedione in female F344/N rats based on increased incidences of mononuclear cell leukemia. There was clear evidence of carcinogenic activity of androstenedione in male B6C3F1 mice based on increased incidences of multiple hepatocellular adenoma and hepatocellular carcinoma and increased incidence of hepatoblastoma. There was clear evidence of carcinogenic activity of androstenedione in female B6C3F1 mice based on increased incidences of hepatocellular adenoma and hepatocellular carcinoma. Increased incidences of pancreatic islet adenoma in male and female mice were also considered chemical related. Androstenedione administration caused increased incidences in nonneoplastic lesions of the liver in male and female rats and mice; pancreatic islets and exocrine pancreas of female rats; and clitoral gland, kidney, and submandibular salivary gland of female mice. Decreases in the incidences of testicular interstitial cell adenoma in male rats, mammary gland fibroadenoma, cysts, and hyperplasia in female rats, and malignant lymphoma in female mice were considered related to androstenedione administration.

In people with asthma, a fraction of CD4(+) T cells express the CX3CL1 receptor, CX3CR1, and CX3CL1 expression is increased in airway smooth muscle, lung endothelium and epithelium upon allergen challenge. Here we found that untreated CX3CR1-deficient mice or wild-type (WT) mice treated with CX3CR1-blocking reagents show reduced lung disease upon allergen sensitization and challenge. Transfer of WT CD4(+) T cells into CX3CR1-deficient mice restored the cardinal features of asthma, and CX3CR1-blocking reagents prevented airway inflammation in CX3CR1-deficient recipients injected with WT T(H)2 cells. We found that CX3CR1 signaling promoted T(H)2 survival in the inflamed lungs, and injection of B cell leukemia/lymphoma-2 protein (BCl-2)-transduced CX3CR1-deficient T(H)2 cells into CX3CR1-deficient mice restored asthma. CX3CR1-induced survival was also observed for T(H)1 cells upon airway inflammation but not under homeostatic conditions or upon peripheral inflammation. Therefore, CX3CR1 and CX3CL1 may represent attractive therapeutic targets in asthma.","['University of Nice-Sophia Antipolis, U924, Valbonne, France.']",,,,,,,,"['Nat Rev Immunol. 2010 Dec;10(12):810.

Epub 2010 Oct 30.,"Protein engineering has led to a significantly improved understanding of the biophysical properties of proteins and, importantly, of the molecular mechanisms of disease. Moreover, it has enabled scientists to modify the molecular characteristics of peptides and proteins, leading to improved pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of protein therapeutics. Consequently, biopharmaceuticals, such as monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), interferons/cytokines or vaccines, contribute increasingly to clinical practice. Some of these new treatments have dramatically changed the outcome of specific diseases. However, treatment options remain limited in many conditions, particularly in malignant disease, despite a much-improved understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying cancer. With the successful pre-clinical development of therapeutic biomolecules, the most significant barrier prior to implementation into clinical practice is proof of concept in humans. This is in part addressed by clinical trials that evaluate the toxicology, dose response and efficacy of the molecules. This observational study summarises the current state of biopharmaceuticals in clinical trials and provides a particular focus on oncology trials. It identifies those cancer types that are most likely to benefit from the efforts made in pre-clinical protein science and establishes evidence that engineered proteins and peptides are set to play a growing role in clinical practice. This study was based on the 95,254 trials registered on the National Institute of Health Clinical Trials Database by 31 August 2010. Of these, 25,525 trials assigned to cancer conditions, including leukaemia and lymphoma, were further analysed, with a particular focus on the 3653 interventional trials that were based on biological interventions. The inclusion criterion for the analysis was registration on the Clinical Trials Database by the above date. No other trials were included. Biopharmaceuticals were the more prevalent intervention in cancer trials (14%) compared with trials in non-cancer conditions (6%). Further subgroup analysis based on the 20 cancer subtypes with the highest mortality revealed that biological therapeutics comprise 43% in malignant melanoma trials and more than 20% in five other cancer types. Two-thirds of all monoclonal antibody are registered in cancer trials (1033, 4.6% of all cancer trials). The subgroup analysis demonstrated a predominance of lymphoma and leukaemia trials for antibody interventions, with 204 and 163 trials registered, respectively. In non-cancer conditions only 503 (0.9%) trials investigate monoclonal antibody interventions. A retrospective longitudinal analysis of the trials demonstrated that monoclonal antibody trials are increasingly frequently registered in non-cancer as well as cancer conditions. However, biopharmaceutical trials continue to be registered more frequently only in non-cancer conditions, but have come to a plateau in cancers. This study is limited by analysis of data from one database only. While the NIH Clinical Trials Database used is the most comprehensive and internationally recognised of its kind, it is possible that the results may have been modified if other databases were also included. Protein engineering has paved the way for biopharmaceutical clinical interventions. A cross-sectional analysis of trials registered on the NIH Clinical Trial Database shows that biological interventions are increasingly entered into clinical trials. While oncological diseases used to lead this effort, biotherapeutic trials in non-cancer conditions have now become more frequent in comparison. Monoclonal antibodies, however, are still mainly investigated in oncological conditions. Haemato-oncological diseases are most frequently investigated for mAb interventions, although they are not among the eight most common causes of cancer mortality.

Epub 2010 Oct 29.,"Telomere maintenance by either telomerase activity or the recombination-mediated alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) mechanism is a hallmark of cancer. Tumors that use ALT as their telomere maintenance mechanism are characterized by long telomeres of great heterogeneity in length and by specific nuclear structures of co-localized promyelocytic leukemia protein and telomere DNA, called ALT-associated promyelocytic leukemia bodies (APBs). Recent advances have revealed a direct role for APBs in telomere recombination in ALT-positive cells. In this study, we investigated the possibility that APBs could occur before the long 'alternatively' lengthened telomeres arise, particularly in low-grade tumors. We measured APBs, telomere length, and telomerase activity in 64 astrocytomas inclusive of grade 1-4 tumors. Almost all grade 1-3 tumors (93%) were APB-positive using published criteria. Grade 2-3 APB-positive tumors also had long telomeres and were confirmed as ALT positive. However, grade 1 tumors lacked long telomeres and were therefore classified as ALT negative, but positive for telomere-associated promyelocytic leukemia bodies (TPB). This is the first report of a TPB-positive but ALT-negative tumor, and suggests that low-grade tumors have the foundation for recombinational telomere repair, as in ALT. Further work is warranted to characterize the TPB-positive phenotype in other early malignancies, as well as to determine whether TPBs predispose to telomere maintenance by ALT.","['Department of Pathology, Dunedin School of Medicine, PO Box 913, University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand.']",['Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom'],PMC2993310,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2010 Oct 29.,"BAK is a key protein mediating mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization; however, its behavior in the membrane is poorly understood. Here, we characterize the conformational changes in BAK and MCL-1 using detergents to mimic the membrane environment and study their interaction by in vitro pulldown experiments, size exclusion chromatography, titration calorimetry, and NMR spectroscopy. The nonionic detergent IGEPAL has little impact on the structure of MCL-1 but induces a conformational change in BAK, whereby its BH3 region is able to engage the hydrophobic groove of MCL-1. Although the zwitterionic detergent CHAPS induces only minor conformational changes in both proteins, it is still able to initiate heterodimerization. The complex of MCL-1 and BAK can be disrupted by a BID-BH3 peptide, which acts through binding to MCL-1, but a mutant peptide, BAK-BH3-L78A, with low affinity for MCL-1 failed to dissociate the complex. The mutation L78A in BAK prevented binding to MCL-1, thus demonstrating the essential role of the BH3 region of BAK in its regulation by MCL-1. Our results validate the current models for the activation of BAK and highlight the potential value of small molecule inhibitors that target MCL-1 directly.","['Department of Biochemistry, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec H3G 0B1, Canada.']",['MOP-81277/Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada'],PMC3003418,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: GSI treatment induced morphologic erythroid differentiation and promoted hemoglobin production. GSI treatment suppressed short-term growth and colony formation, while treatment with GSI-XXI promoted the growth of AA cells. The degree of differentiation induced by each GSI roughly correlated with the reduction in HES1 mRNA expression. CONCLUSION: GSIs have potential uses in differentiation induction therapy for erythroid leukemia in the future. Before clinical use, in vitro sensitivity tests should be performed because the effects of GSIs are diverse depending upon the combination of leukemia cells and GSIs.","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Bunkyo-Ku, Tokyo, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The effects of amphiphilic dihydropyridine derivative K-2-11 were tested on MDR1-expressing mouse lymphoma cells and their parental control. The effects of K-2-11 with and without doxorubicin were studied by determination of cell viability, cell proliferation and production of reactive oxygen species. RESULTS: K-2-11 caused complete reversal of multidrug resistance of the MDR cells, being much more efficient than the positive control verapamil. Accordingly, the cytotoxic effects of doxorubicin were enhanced by K-2-11, both in the MDR and in parental cell line, while K-2-11 alone did not affect cell viability. K-2-11 also acted as an antioxidant, reducing the cellular generation of reactive oxygen species.

Here we show that 5-FU triggers apoptosis in Jurkat cells in a dose-dependent manner. Death responses were only moderately attenuated in the presence of a general caspase inhibitor. However, flow cytometric analysis showed activation of caspase 3 and a slight increase in ROS generation in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, we observed 5-FU induced PARP cleavage and notably, reduced expression of antiapoptotic MCL-1L associated with the appearance of proapoptotic MCL-1S.

Epub 2010 Oct 30.,"BACKGROUND: Global variations in the frequency of the major sub-types of lymphoma have been reported. However, studies on different sub-types of adult malignant lymphoma had never been conducted in Mashhad, Iran. In this paper, we aimed to identify the major sub-types of malignant lymphoma in our area and compare the distribution with other published studies. METHODS: During a retrospective study we evaluate 391 adult patients with lymphoid malignancy from ""Omid Hospital"" - a cancer research center and an outpatient hematologic clinic in Mashhad - were evaluated from 2000 to 2009. Patients were reclassified using the World Health Organization (WHO) classification. RESULTS: The frequency of non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL) was 92% (n=359) and Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) was 8% (n=32). The most frequent NHL sub-type using WHO classification was diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and the second most common NHL was chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL). The most common sub-type of HL was mixed cellularity. In this study the frequency of primary extranodal NHL in our study was 11.5%, which slightly less common than other eastern countries. CONCLUSION: Our findings add to the body of knowledge concerning geographic variations in the descriptive epidemiology of the major lymphoma sub-types. Such observations are extremely important since they potentially point to underling etiological variations.","['Hematology-Oncology Department, Mashhad University of Medical Science, Mashhad, Iran. mozahebz@mums.ac.ir']",,,,,['Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Epub 2010 Oct 29.,"Signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs) were first identified as key signaling molecules in response to cytokines. Constitutive STAT activation also has been widely implicated in oncogenesis. We analyzed STAT5-associated proteins in a leukemic T cell line LSTRA, which exhibits constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of STAT5. A cellular protein was found to specifically interact with STAT5 in LSTRA cells by co-immunoprecipitation. Sequencing analysis and subsequent immunoblotting confirmed the identity of this STAT5-associated protein as the E2 component of mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC-E2). Consistent with this interaction, both subcellular fractionation and immunofluorescence microscopy revealed mitochondrial localization of STAT5 in LSTRA cells. Mitochondrial localization of tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT5 also occurred in cytokine-stimulated cells. A time course experiment further demonstrated the transient kinetics of STAT5 mitochondrial translocation after cytokine stimulation. In contrast, cytokine-induced STAT1 and STAT3 activation did not result in their translocation into mitochondria. Furthermore, we showed that mitochondrial STAT5 bound to the D-loop regulatory region of mitochondrial DNA in vitro. It suggests a potential role of STAT5 in regulating the mitochondrial genome. Proliferative metabolism toward aerobic glycolysis is well known in cancer cells as the Warburg effect and is also observed in cytokine-stimulated cells. Our novel findings of cytokine-induced STAT5 translocation into mitochondria and its link to oncogenesis provide important insights into the underlying mechanisms of this characteristic metabolic shift.","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Chicago Medical School, Rosalind Franklin University of Medicine and Science, North Chicago, IL 60064, USA.']","['CA107210/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA107210-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA107210-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA107210-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA107210/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA107210-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA107210-01A2/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA107210-06/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3032423,['NIHMS249321'],,['Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2010 Oct 30.,"A significant drop in the prevalence of feline leukaemia virus (FeLV) antigenaemic cats and antigen-associated lymphomas has been observed after the introduction of FeLV vaccination and antigen-testing with removal of persistently antigenaemic cats. However, recent reports have indicated that regressively infected cats may contain FeLV provirus DNA and that lymphoma development may be associated with the presence of provirus alone. In the present study, we investigated the presence of FeLV antigen and provirus DNA in 50 lymphomas by immunohistochemistry and semi-nested polymerase chain reaction, respectively. Interestingly, almost 80% of T-cell lymphomas and 60% of B-cell lymphomas contained provirus DNA while only 21% of T-cell lymphomas and 11% of B-cell lymphomas expressed FeLV antigen. In conclusion, our results support previous hypotheses that vaccination and removal of persistently antigenaemic cats have led to a drop in FeLV antigen-expressing lymphomas. However, FeLV provirus DNA is still present in a high percentage of feline lymphomas.","['Department of Veterinary Pathology, Freie Universitat Berlin, Robert-von-Ostertag-Str 15, 14163 Berlin, Germany. weiss.alexander@vetmed.fu-berlin.de']",,,,,['Copyright (c) 2010 ISFM and AAFP.

Epub 2010 Oct 29.,"PURPOSE: To investigate the dosimetric feasibility of linear accelerator-based intensity-modulated total marrow irradiation (IM-TMI) in patients with hematologic malignancies. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Linear accelerator-based IM-TMI treatment planning was performed for 9 patients using the Eclipse treatment planning system. The planning target volume (PTV) consisted of all the bones in the body from the head to the mid-femur, except for the forearms and hands. Organs at risk (OAR) to be spared included the lungs, heart, liver, kidneys, brain, eyes, oral cavity, and bowel and were contoured by a physician on the axial computed tomography images. The three-isocenter technique previously developed by our group was used for treatment planning. We developed and used a common dose-volume objective method to reduce the planning time and planner subjectivity in the treatment planning process. RESULTS: A 95% PTV coverage with the 99% of the prescribed dose of 12 Gy was achieved for all nine patients. The average dose reduction in OAR ranged from 19% for the lungs to 68% for the lenses. The common dose-volume objective method decreased the planning time by an average of 35% and reduced the inter- and intra- planner subjectivity. CONCLUSION: The results from the present study suggest that the linear accelerator-based IM-TMI technique is clinically feasible. We have demonstrated that linear accelerator-based IM-TMI plans with good PTV coverage and improved OAR sparing can be obtained within a clinically reasonable time using the common dose-volume objective method proposed in the present study.","['Center for Molecular Biology of Oral Diseases, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637, USA.']",,,,,['Copyright (c) 2011.

In the present study we provide evidence that CDDO-Im exerts in vitro a potent inhibitory effect on erythroid cell proliferation and survival and a stimulatory action on megakaryocytic differentiation. The effect of CDDO-Im on erythroid and megakaryocytic differentiation was evaluated both on normal hemopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) induced to selective erythroid (E) or megakaryocytic (Mk) differentiation and on erythroleukemic cell lines HEL and TF1. The inhibitory effect of CDDO-Im on erythroid cell survival and proliferation is mainly related to a reduced GATA-1 expression. This conclusion is supported by the observation that GATA-1 overexpressing TF1 cells are partially protected from the inhibitory effect of CDDO-Im on cell proliferation and survival.

Epub 2010 Oct 29.,"Embryo implantation is the group of processes by which the developing blastocyst adheres to, and embeds into, the receptive endometrium. Changes in the expression of molecules on the cell surface have been seen in the conversion of the endometrial surface from a non-receptive to a receptive state. Cell adhesion molecules like integrins, or soluble factors such as Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) have been identified to play an important role during the implantation period. Studies have suggested that low-dose aspirin (<100 mg/d) treatment can improve implantation rate, ovarian responsiveness, and pregnant rates in IVF patients. The mechanism of this increased implantation rate is unclear, and in this study we hypothesised that the expression of integrin beta3 or LIF may be altered, during implantation window, by treatment with low-dose aspirin. Female mice were treated with 0.9 mg/ml aspirin daily for 15 days and then were mated. The protein or mRNA levels of LIF and integrin beta3 in the endmetrium were determined on the day 4 post-coitus using immuno-fluorescence and RT-PCR. We found the expression of LIF or integrin beta3 was significantly increased in the endometrium of mice that were treated with low dose of aspirin by immuno-fluorescence. In addition, the mRNA level of LIF or integrin beta3 on the endometrium of aspirin treated mice was also significantly increased compared to untreated mice. We conclude that low dose aspirin alters the expression of endometrial LIF and integrin beta3 and that these changes may increase endometrial receptivity.","[""Wuxi Maternity and Children's Hospital, Affiliated Nanjing Medical University, China.""]",,,,,['Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The screening cascade employs cellular phenotypic assays based on mitotic index and nuclear p53 protein accumulation. This permitted us to classify compounds into transcriptional, cell cycle, and mitotic inhibitor groups. We describe the characterization of the transcriptional inhibitor class in terms of kinase inhibition profile, cellular mode of action, and selectivity for transformed cells. A structural selectivity rationale was used to optimize potency and biopharmaceutical properties and led to the development of a transcriptional inhibitor, 3,4-dimethyl-5-[2-(4-piperazin-1-yl-phenylamino)-pyrimidin-4-yl]-3H-thiazol-2-one , with anticancer activity in animal models.","['Cyclacel Limited, Dundee DD15JJ, Scotland, UK.']",['11431/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom'],,,,['Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

However, direct evidence of the involvement of this mechanism in cancer has been gathered only recently.

An autonomous lipid-dependent signaling system, independently regulated from its plasma membrane counterpart, acts in the nucleus and modulates cell cycle progression and differentiation.We and others focused on PLCbeta1, which is the most extensively investigated PLC isoform in the nuclear compartment. PLCbeta1 is a key player in the regulation of nuclear inositol lipid signaling, and, as discussed above, its function could also be involved in nuclear structure because it hydrolyses PtdIns(4,5)P2, a well accepted regulator of chromatin remodelling. The evidence, in a number of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes, that the mono-allelic deletion of PLCbeta1 is associated with an increased risk of developing acute myeloid leukemia paves the way for an entirely new field of investigation. Indeed the genetic defect evidenced, in addition to being a useful prognostic tool, also suggests that altered expression of this enzyme could have a role in the pathogenesis of this disease, by causing an imbalance between proliferation and apoptosis. The epigenetics of PLCbeta1 expression in MDS has been reviewed as well.","['Cellular Signalling Laboratory, Department of Human Anatomical Sciences, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition to these two classes of mutations, a relevant role for angiogenesis in the pathophysiology of AML has been recently proposed. The recognition that the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway is a key regulator of angiogenesis has led to the development of several VEGF-targeted approaches. These include neutralizing antibodies, VEGF traps or selective tyrosine kinase inhibitors for VEGFRs. Other drugs that indirectly affect VEGF pathway, such as statins or arsenic trioxide, also have been shown to possess antiangiogenic activity in leukemias. The benefits of these VEGF targeted agents and their current stage of development as novel anti-antiangiogenic therapies in AML are discussed in this review.","['Unidad de Investigacion, Hospital Universitario Reina Sofia, Instituto Maimonides de Investigacion Biomedica de Cordoba, IMIBIC, Spain.']",,,,,['Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The present study investigated the toxicity of zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles toward prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. Cytotoxicity of ZnO to mammalian cells was studied using human myeloblastic leukemia cells (HL60) and normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Antibacterial activity of ZnO was also tested against the Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, as well as the Gram-positive bacterium Staphylococcus aureus, and the effect was more pronounced with the Gram-positive than the Gram-negative bacteria. ZnO nanoparticles exhibited a preferential ability to kill cancerous HL60 cells as compared with normal PBMCs. The nanoparticles enhanced ultrasound-induced lipid peroxidation in the liposomal membrane. The work suggested two mechanisms underlying the toxicity of ZnO: (i) involvement of the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and (ii) induction of apoptosis. The work also revealed potential utility of ZnO nanoparticles in the treatment of cancer, for their selective toxicity to cancer cells. FROM THE CLINICAL EDITOR: The toxicity of zinc oxide to bacteria was related to the generation of reactive oxygen species and to the induction of apoptosis.

Epub 2010 Oct 27.,"CLL is not associated with EBV. CLL cells separated from blood express CR2, the complement receptor that serves also as EBV receptor. Thus CLL cells can be infected in vitro with the virus, however, in contrast to normal B lymphocytes, only rare CLL clones yield transformed lines. This is due to a restricted EBV encoded protein expression in the CLL cells, they express EBNAs, the virus encoded proteins that are localized in the nucleus, but not the cell membrane associated LMP-1, that is also pivotal for the virus induced transformation of B lymphocytes. This expression pattern seems to be unique to a defined B cell maturation window that is represented by the CLL cells. We named this restricted viral expression as Type IIb. Such B lymphocytes have been encountered in lymphoid tissues of infectious mononucleosis (IM) and in post transplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD). Moreover, they were shown in tissues of EBV infected ""humanized"" mice. The EBV encoded protein expression pattern may serve as a marker for the B cell differentiation stage from which CLL clones can develop.","['Department of Microbiology, Tumor and Cell Biology, Karolinska Institute, Nobelsv. 16, Stockholm, Sweden.

Here, we focus on changes that, as compared to the 2001 edition, were introduced into the 2008 WHO classification of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and related precursor neoplasms. The category of AML with recurrent genetic abnormalities was expanded to account for 60% of AML by adding three distinct entities, i.e., AML with t(6,9), inv(3), or t(1;22), and two provisional entities, i.e., AML with mutated NPM1 or CEBPA. These changes have greatly modified the approaches to diagnosis and prognostic stratification of AML patients. To emphasize the need of various parameters for diagnosis, including myelodysplasia (MD)-related cytogenetic abnormalities, history of myelodysplasia or myelodysplasia/myeloproliferative neoplasm, and multilineage dysplasia, the category of ""AML with multilineage dysplasia"" was re-named AML with MD-related changes.

Mutated JAK2 (V617F) has the ability to activate downstream signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)-mediated transcription in the absence of the ligand erythropoietin. The autoinhibitory activity of JAK2 is disrupted by the presence of the V617F mutation. Somatic mutation in JAK2 (V617F) gene has been reported in myeloid disorders. This study reports the prevalence of JAK2V617F using amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS)-polymerase chain reaction in 246 Egyptian patients with different myeloid disorders and studied the relationship between the JAK2V617F mutation and parameters in peripheral blood. The mutation was detected among 88 patients (35.8%) with different myeloid disorders. JAK2V617F was found among 81.4% of polycythemia vera (PV), 50% of essential thrombocythemia, 46.1% of primary myelofibrosis (PMF), 33.3% of philadelphia (Ph)-negative chronic myeloid leukemia, 33.3% of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)/myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN), and 50% of refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts associated with marked thrombocytosis (RARS-T) patients. Hemoglobin and white blood cells were significantly higher in the mutated group of MPN including PV, essential thrombocythemia, and PMF, whereas platelet counts were higher among the mutated PV, PMF, RARS-T, and MDS/MPN group.

The objective of this study was to determine whether the 23-bp and 12-bp insertion/deletion polymorphism within the PRNP gene leads to significant differences in the blood lymphocyte profile and to investigate changes in the composition of these cells in cattle naturally infected with Bovine Leukemia Virus. An analysis of the effect of the bovine PRNP gene polymorphism on the blood lymphocyte profile revealed considerable differences between animals with the 23-bp indel genotypes, and small and statistically non-significant differences between those with the 12-bp indel genotypes. 23-bp del/del homozygotes had a significantly lower percentage of T lymphocytes with the phenotypes CD2 (P < 0.01), CD8 (P < 0.01) and WC1-N2 (P < 0.05), and a higher ratio of CD4 to CD8 T lymphocytes, compared to animals with the 23-bp ins/ins genotype. The obtained results indicate that the 23-bp indel polymorphism, in contrast to the 12-bp indel polymorphism, has a significant effect on changes in the blood lymphocyte profile. The size of blood lymphocyte subpopulations was also found to change under the influence of enzootic bovine leukosis. The direction of those changes in EBL-positive animals is consistent with that observed in 23-bp del/del homozygotes, which may testify to the adverse effect of this genotype on immunological efficiency.","['Department of Animal Genetics, University of Warmia and Mazury in Olsztyn Oczapowskiego 5, 10-719 Olsztyn, Poland. ewagen@uwm.edu.pl']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Development of the abundant neoplastic vasculature results from an imbalance between pro- and antiangiogenic regulatory mechanisms. The investigation was focused on expression of the main regulatory angiogeneic factors in different phases of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and on influence of leukemic cells on the human umbilical vein endothelial cells proliferation. The groups of 29 patients with CML and of 14 healthy controls were enrolled to the study. The expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), basic fibroblast growth factor, interleukin-8, angiopoetin-1, platelet factor-4, extracellular matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) -2 and -9 as well as tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases was determined in peripheral blood and bone marrow mononuclear cells with the use of quantitative real-time PCR method and additionally the concentration of VEGF with the flow cytofluorometry. We evaluated the phosphorylation of endothelial mitogen activated protein kinase in human umbilical vein endothelial cells after incubation in CML cells conditioned media, applying Western blot technique. We determined an influence of the leukemic cells on the endothelial cells proliferation with the colorimetric metabolic MTT test. We showed, that in peripheral blood and bone marrow mononuclear cells in CML patients most of the studied factors were increased at the time of CML diagnosis and became lower in remission. In newly diagnosed CML patients an expression of VEGF, MMP-2 and MMP-9 was particularly elevated. In remission, the levels of VEGF and metalloproteinases, specifically MMP-9, were decreased. If failed to achieve remission, the patients presented the elevated expression of most of the investigated angiogenic factors. In the acceleration or blast crisis phase angiopoetin, VEGF and MMP-2 levels were particularly high. We noticed the markedly enhanced human umbilical vein endothelium proliferation after an incubation in CML cells conditioned media, both in the test of mitogen activated protein kinase phosphorylation in endothelial cells and in the metabolic test for the proliferation intensity of endothelium. The differences of an angiogeneic potential found between clinical phases of CML, and the ability of leukemic cells to stimulate endothelial proliferation, point at the significance of neovascularisation in CML pathogenesis. Further studies are necessary to delineate the possibility of the use of angiogenic inhibitors in the treatment of this malignancy.","['Katedra i Klinika Hematologii, Collegium Medicum, Uniwersytetu Jagiellonskiego, Krakow. alkk@mp.pl']",,,,,,,,,,,,,Angiogeneza a stadium zaawansowania przewleklej bialaczki szpikowej.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The ethylacetate (EtOAc) layer of the extract has shown an inhibitory effect on beta-hexo release from RBL-2H3 cells at the antigen antibody binding stage. The water (H(2)O) fraction (EFW) of the chloroform (CHCl(3)) extract from the EtOAc layer also inhibited beta-hexo release at the same stage in a dose-dependent manner. With column chromatography preparation, proton and carbon nuclear magnetic resonance ((1)H and (1)(3)C NMR) spectra, electron ionization mass spectrometer (EI-MS) spectra, and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis, the active component was determined to be 5-(hydroxymethyl)furfural (5-HMF). Thus, the 5-HMF showed an inhibitory effect on beta-hexo release at the antigen-antibody binding stage and the antibody-receptor binding stage. Furthermore, 5-HMF suppressed [Ca(2)+] I influx in the IgE-sensitized BSA-stimulated RBL-2H3 cells.

The current analyses present clinical parameters and outcomes of adolescents treated in pediatric NHL-BFM trials. Patients were stratified by histological subtype: lymphoblastic lymphoma (LBL); mature B-NHL, including Burkitt's lymphoma/leukemia (BL/B-AL), diffuse B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL-CB) and mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (PMLBL); and anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL). Between October 1986 and December 2007, 2915 patients were registered, including 378 (13%) adolescents (15-18 years) with BL/B-AL (n=101), ALCL (n=74), DLBCL-CB (n=55), T-LBL (n=45), PMLBL (n=24), pB-LBL (n=13) and rare or not-specified NHL subtypes (n=66). The 5-year event-free survival (EFS) was 79+/-2% for adolescents compared with 85+/-1% for patients aged <15 years (P=0.014). EFS was 83+/-7% for adolescents with T-LBL, 82+/-4% with BL/B-AL, 85+/-5% with DLBCL-CB, 57+/-10% with PMLBL and 70+/-6% with ALCL.

Adolescents with NHL treated according to pediatric NHL-BFM protocols had an EFS of 79+/-2%, which is marginally inferior to that of children. In adolescents with T-LBL and DLBCL-CB, female sex was associated with a worse prognosis.","['NHL-BFM Study Center, Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Justus Liebig University, Giessen, Germany. birgit.burkhardt@paediat.med.uni-giessen.de']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2010 Oct 29.,"The adapter protein Slp65 and Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk) are key components of the precursor-B (pre-B) cell receptor (pre-BCR) signaling pathway. Slp65-deficient mice spontaneously develop pre-B-cell leukemia, expressing high levels of the pre-BCR on their cell surface. As leukemic Slp65-deficient pre-B cells express the recombination activating genes (Rag)1 and Rag2, and manifest ongoing immunoglobulin (Ig) light-chain rearrangement, it has been hypothesized that deregulated recombinase activity contributes to malignant transformation. In this report, we investigated whether Rag-induced DNA damage is involved in oncogenic transformation of Slp65-deficient B cells. We employed Btk/Slp65 double-deficient mice carrying an autoreactive 3-83mudelta BCR transgene. When developing B cells in their bone marrow express this BCR, the V(D)J recombination machinery will be activated, allowing for secondary Ig light-chain gene rearrangements to occur. This phenomenon, called receptor editing, will rescue autoreactive B cells from apoptosis. We observed that 3-83mudelta transgenic Btk/Slp65 double-deficient mice developed B-cell leukemias expressing both the 3-83mudelta BCR and the pre-BCR components lambda5/VpreB. Importantly, such leukemias were found at similar frequencies in mice concomitantly deficient for Rag1 or the non-homologous end-joining factor DNA-PKcs. We therefore conclude that malignant transformation of Btk/Slp65 double-deficient pre-B cells is independent of deregulated V(D)J recombination activity.","['Department of Pulmonary Medicine, Erasmus MC Rotterdam, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we affinity purified the AF4-MLL and AF4 protein complexes to elucidate their function. We observed that the AF4 complex consists of 11 binding partners and exhibits positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb)-mediated activation of promoter-arrested RNA polymerase (pol) II in conjunction with several chromatin-modifying activities. In contrast, the AF4-MLL complex consists of at least 16 constituents including P-TEFb kinase, H3K4(me3) and H3K79(me3) histone methyltransferases (HMT), a protein arginine N-methyltransferase and a histone acetyltransferase. These findings suggest that the AF4-MLL protein disturbs the fine-tuned activation cycle of promoter-arrested RNA Pol II and causes altered histone methylation signatures. Thus, we propose that these two processes are key to trigger cellular reprogramming that leads to the onset of acute leukemia.","['Institute of Pharmaceutical Biology/ZAFES, Goethe-University of Frankfurt, Biocenter, Frankfurt/Main, Germany.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Genetic lesions in PHF6 found in AMLs are frameshift and nonsense mutations distributed through the gene or point mutations involving the second plant homeodomain (PHD)-like domain of the protein. As in the case of T-ALL, where PHF6 alterations are found almost exclusively in males, mutations in PHF6 were seven times more prevalent in males than in females with AML.

Epub 2010 Oct 28.,"After the discovery of NPM1-mutated acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in 2005 and its subsequent inclusion as a provisional entity in the 2008 World Health Organization classification of myeloid neoplasms, several controversial issues remained to be clarified. It was unclear whether the NPM1 mutation was a primary genetic lesion and whether additional chromosomal aberrations and multilineage dysplasia had any impact on the biologic and prognostic features of NPM1-mutated AML. Moreover, it was uncertain how to classify AML patients who were double-mutated for NPM1 and CEBPA. Recent studies have shown that: (1) the NPM1 mutant perturbs hemopoiesis in experimental models; (2) leukemic stem cells from NPM1-mutated AML patients carry the mutation; and (3) the NPM1 mutation is usually mutually exclusive of biallelic CEPBA mutations. Moreover, the biologic and clinical features of NPM1-mutated AML do not seem to be significantly influenced by concomitant chromosomal aberrations or multilineage dysplasia. Altogether, these pieces of evidence point to NPM1-mutated AML as a founder genetic event that defines a distinct leukemia entity accounting for approximately one-third of all AML.","['Institute of Hematology, University of Perugia, Ospedale S.

Epub 2010 Oct 28.,"We assessed the predictive factors for outcome and response in 123 patients with chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase treated with second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) after imatinib failure. Better event-free survival rates with second-generation TKI therapy were associated with a previous cytogenetic response to imatinib (P < .001) and a performance status of 0 (P = .001). Patients with 0, 1, or 2 adverse factors had 2-year event-free survival rates of 78%, 49%, and 20% (P < .001), respectively; 2-year overall survival rates of 95%, 85%, and 40%, (P = .002), respectively; and a 12-month probability of achieving a major cytogenetic response of 64%, 36%, and 20% (P = .007), respectively. In conclusion, patients with poor performance status and no previous cytogenetic response to imatinib therapy have a low likelihood of responding to second-generation TKI with poor event-free survival and therefore should be offered additional treatment options. This scoring system could serve to advise patients of their prognosis and treatment options, as well as to evaluate the benefit of newer alternate options.","['Department of Leukemia, University of Texas M.

However, it is unknown whether this enzyme is expressed or plays any role in malignant hematological diseases. In this study, we found strong and highly selective CYP2J2 expression in five human-derived malignant hematological cell lines and in leukemia cells from peripheral blood and bone marrow in 36 of 42 patients (86%) with malignant hematologic diseases. Furthermore, increased levels of EETs were detected in urine and blood samples from these patients. Addition of exogenous EET or CYP2J2 overexpression in cultured human-derived malignant hematologic cell lines markedly accelerated proliferation and attenuated apoptosis. Addition of the selective CYP2J2 inhibitor compound 26 (C26; 1-[4-(vinyl) phenyl]-4-[4-(diphenyl-hydroxymethyl)-piperidinyl]-butanone hydrochloride) inhibited cell proliferation and increased apoptosis, an effect that was significantly reversed by EET. CYP2J2 overexpression and exogenous EET activated AMP-activated protein kinase, c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt signaling pathways, and increased epidermal growth factor receptor phosphorylation levels. CYP2J2 overexpression also enhanced malignant xenograft growth, which was efficiently inhibited by oral administration of C26 in Tie2-CYP2J2 transgenic mice and in severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) xenograft mice. Together, these results suggest that CYP2J2 plays a key role in the pathogenesis of human hematologic malignant diseases. Selective inhibition of CYP2J2 may be a promising therapeutic strategy for these conditions.","[""Department of Internal Medicine and Gene Therapy Center, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, People's Republic of China.""]","['Z01 ES025034/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States', 'Z01-ES025034/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3033713,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Aptamers are small oligonucleotides that can specifically bind to a wide range of target molecules and offer some advantages over antibodies as therapeutic agents. Here, we report the rational engineering of aptamer TD05 into multimeric forms reactive with the BCR that may be useful in biomedical applications. Systematic truncation of TD05 coupled with modification with locked nucleic acids (LNA) increased conformational stability and nuclease resistance. Trimeric and tetrameric versions with optimized polyethyleneglycol (PEG) linker lengths exhibited high avidity at physiological temperatures both in vitro and in vivo. Competition and protease studies showed that the multimeric, optimized aptamer bound to membrane-associated human mIgM, but not with soluble IgM in plasma, allowing the possibility of targeting leukemias and lymphomas in vivo.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We have investigated the affect of subcutaneous omacetaxine (OMA, or homo-harringtonine) cycles on unmutated and T315I-mutated BCR-ABL transcripts in a series of 8 TKI-resistant chronic-phase CML patients and we have addressed the question of whether the administration of OMA could resensitize patients to TKIs. Patients were regularly monitored for total disease burden and for BCR-ABLT315I transcripts using a new quantitative sensitive technique (sensitivity threshold, 0.05%), for up to 27 cycles of OMA. RESULTS: Overall, patients demonstrated hematologic, cytogenetic, or molecular improvement. An initial rapid decline and a sustained disappearance of T315I-mutated transcripts were observed in 50% of patients, after a median of 10.5 cycles (range, 3-27 cycles) of OMA. As the unmutated leukemic burden reduction was modest, 2 patients were submitted to nilotinib after 9 months of sustained BCR-ABLT315I transcripts negativity on OMA and mutated transcripts remained undetectable after a median follow-up of 12 months on nilotinib challenge. CONCLUSION: We suggest that OMA (ie, a non-targeted therapy) might provide a better disease control allowing the disappearance of the mutated clone probably elicited by the clone deselection after TKI release, and/or a preferential activity of OMA on the T315I-mutated cells through unknown mechanisms. These observations suggest that OMA could allow a safe TKI rechallenge in patients with resistant chronic-phase CML.","['Hematology Department, E.

New prognostic factors have been characterized that help identify patients at high risk of rapid disease progression, refractoriness to treatment, and short overall survival (OS). These advances have led to a significant paradigm shift in the management of CLL. Novel therapeutic strategies, including combinations of monoclonal antibodies with conventional chemotherapy, have dramatically improved response rates, remission duration, and recently, OS. However, these benefits do not appear to extend to certain patient subsets, especially those with unfavorable clinical or cytogenetic risk factors. The majority of patients with CLL will invariably relapse following first-line therapy and can acquire high-risk genetic abnormalities. Repeated treatment leads to eventual therapeutic refractoriness and shortened survival compared with age-matched healthy individuals. Several novel agents and strategies, including next-generation anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies, the alkylating agent bendamustine, the immunomodulatory agent lenalidomide, the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor flavopiridol, and small-molecule Bcl2 inhibitors, are currently under clinical investigation as novel agents that will hopefully improve treatment outcomes for CLL. Though allogeneic stem cell transplantation offers curative potential, it also presents clinical challenges in terms of patient appropriateness, donor availability, and timing. The merits and challenges of incorporating these treatment modalities into the treatment algorithm for patients with CLL, as discussed by a panel of experts in CLL, are outlined in this article.","['University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA. wwierda@mdanderson.org']",['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fludarabine-refractory patients have a particularly poor prognosis. The addition of the CD20 monoclonal antibody (MoAb) rituximab to chemotherapy in CLL has improved outcomes, particularly in early lines of therapy; however, the efficacy of rituximab monotherapy in CLL is limited, potentially in part because of reduced cell lysis via complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) in this setting. Rituximab CDC is dependent on CD20 expression; CLL cells underexpress CD20. Ofatumumab is a human MoAb that targets an epitope encompassing the membrane-proximal small-loop on the CD20 molecule, which differs from the binding location of rituximab. In vitro studies with ofatumumab have demonstrated that it is significantly more effective than rituximab at corresponding dose levels at lysing CLL cells and B-cell lines, especially those with low CD20 copy numbers. In patients with CLL refractory to both fludarabine and alemtuzumab or refractory to fludarabine with bulky lymphadenopathy and, therefore, less suitable for treatment with the CD52 MoAb alemtuzumab, results from the planned interim analysis showed an encouraging response rate with ofatumumab (Independent Endpoint Review Committee evaluated) and survival parameters, which seemed to be higher than those reported from a historical assessment of other salvage therapies in a corresponding group of patients. Ofatumumab was also well tolerated; the most common adverse events were transient grade 1 or 2 infusion reactions and infections. Ongoing trials will help confirm the role of ofatumumab in CLL, in addition to the effect of this agent in combination with chemotherapies and other MoAbs.","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA. sobrien@mdanderson.org']",['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is well known that FcgammaRs serve as a critical link between the humoral and cellular branches of the immune system and play an important role in many conditions, including infection, cancer, and autoimmune diseases. Recent studies suggest that FcgammaR polymorphisms influence efficacy and side effects of monoclonal antibody-based immunotherapy, which might provide a useful prognostic marker for treatment in the future.

Epub 2010 Oct 27.,"The myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are characterized by cytopenias and acute myeloid leukemia risk. Most MDS patients eventually require transfusion of red blood cells for anemia, placing them at risk of iron overload (IOL). In beta-thalassemia major, transfusional IOL leads to organ dysfunction and death, however, with iron chelation therapy survival improved to near normal and organ function was improved. In lower risk MDS, several non-randomized studies suggest an adverse effect of IOL on survival, and that lowering iron minimizes this impact and may improve organ function. While guidelines for MDS generally recommend chelation in selected lower risk patients, data are emerging suggesting IOL may impact adversely on the outcome of higher risk MDS and stem cell transplantation (SCT) and that lowering iron may be beneficial in these patients. Trials to determine whether these effects are truly from lowering iron are currently enrolling. Chelation is costly and potentially toxic, and in MDS should be initiated after weighing potential risks and benefits for each patient until more definitive data are available. In this paper, data on the impact of IOL in MDS and SCT, possible mechanisms of iron toxicity such as oxidative stress, and the impact of lowering iron on organ function and survival are reviewed.","[""Division of Hematology, St. Paul's Hospital, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada. hleitch@providencehematology.com""]",,,,,['Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Epub 2010 Oct 26.,"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), an incurable disease of the elderly, stands out as unique among the malignancies derived from mature B lymphocytes. The histology, immunophenotype, immunoglobulin variable region (IgV) gene somatic hypermutation status, and the pattern of genetic alterations of the tumor cells are markedly distinct from that of any other B-cell tumor. Most notably, CLL cases can have somatically mutated as well as unmutated IgV genes which largely correlate with a favorable and unfavorable clinical prognosis, respectively. Moreover, recent evidence suggests that 6% of the normal elderly population develops a monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL) that appears as the precursor to CLL in 1-2% of cases. Over the last decade, global gene expression profile analysis was instrumental in defining CLL as a malignancy originating from the oncogenic transformation of a common cellular precursor that resembles an antigen-experienced B cell. These findings were complemented by the realization that all CLL, independent of their IgV gene somatic mutation status, express B-cell receptors (BCRs) that show evidence of antigen-experience. Indeed, the BCRs of CLL cases among different individuals can be similar to the extent that one was able to define subsets of stereotyped receptors based on the homology in the antigen-binding regions. Together, these observations strongly support the notion that antigen plays a critical role in CLL pathogenesis. This role is complemented by genetic alterations that, analogous to most cancer types, represent the initiating pathogenetic event. In fact, CLL cases display recurrent genetic aberrations including trisomy 12 and monoallelic or biallelic deletion/inactivation of chromosomal regions 17p, 11q and 13q14. However, virtually all CLL cases lack balanced reciprocal chromosomal translocations, the genetic hallmark of germinal center (GC)-derived lymphomas. The most frequent genetic aberration in CLL, deletion of chromosomal region 13q14, was recently shown to have a specific role in CLL pathogenesis. This region encodes a tumor suppressor locus comprising a microRNA cluster embedded in a long sterile RNA gene, whose deletion in the mouse leads to lymphoproliferative syndromes recapitulating the human CLL-associated spectrum, including MBL, CLL and B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL).

Epub 2010 Oct 26.,"The recombination activating gene (RAG) is a lymphoid-specific endonuclease involved in the V(D)J recombination. It has long been proposed that mis-targeting of RAG proteins is one of the factors contributing to lymphoid chromosomal translocation bearing authentic recombination signal sequences (RSSs) in immunoglobulin (Ig) and T cell receptor (TCR) gene loci or cryptic RSSs (cRSSs). However, it is unclear whether primary sequence-dependent targeting mistake involved in the chromosomal translocation bearing no Ig/TCR gene loci is mediated by RAG proteins. Using an extrachromosomal recombination assay, we found RAG-dependent recombination in the regions dense in breakpoints within TEL and AML1 gene loci related to acute lymphoid leukemia-associated t(12;21)(p13;q22) chromosomal translocation. Sequence analyses revealed several heptamer-like sequences located in the vicinity of RAG-dependent recombination sites. By chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and ligation-mediated PCR (LM-PCR) assays, we have shown that RAG proteins bind to and cleave the TEL translocation region dense in breakpoints. These results suggest that mis-targeting of RAG proteins to cRSSs within TEL and AML1 translocation regions might be responsible for the t(12;21)(p13;q22) chromosomal translocation not bearing Ig/TCR regions.","['Department of Infection Biology, Graduate School of Comprehensive Human Sciences, University of Tsukuba, Tennodai, Tsukuba, Japan.']",,,,,['Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

To understand the characteristics of tsAM5NE cells, we first examined the responsiveness of the cells to ligands of the GDNF (glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor) family. tsAM5NE cells proliferated at the permissive temperature of 33 degrees C in response to either GDNF or neurturin, but not artemin or persephin. At the non-permissive temperature of 39 degrees C, GDNF or neurturin caused tsAM5NE cells to differentiate into neuron-like cells; however, the differentiated cells died in a time-dependent manner. Interestingly, LIF (leukaemia inhibitory factor) did not affect the GDNF-mediated cell proliferation at 33 degrees C, but promoted the survival and differentiation of GDNF-treated cells at 39 degrees C. In the presence of GDNF plus LIF, the morphological change induced by the temperature shift was associated with up-regulated expression of neuronal markers, indicating that the cells had indeed undergone neuronal differentiation. Thus, we demonstrated that tsAM5NE cells had the capacity to terminally differentiate into neuron-like cells in response to GDNF plus LIF when the oncogene was inactivated by the temperature shift. Thus, this cell line provides a useful model system for studying the mechanisms regulating neuronal differentiation.","['Department of Analytical Neurobiology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Meijo University, Tempaku, Nagoya 4688503, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2010 Oct 26.,"Natural occurring compounds are considered an important source of antitumoral agents. In the present study, the cytotoxic potential of three pentacyclic triterpenes isolated from Chuquiraga erinacea (Asteraceae), against the human leukemic cell lines NB4 and K562 was assessed. Heliantriol B2 (HB2) showed the highest cytotoxic activity after 24 h treatment showing IC(50) values of 1.98 +/- 0.12 microm and 3.52 +/- 0.14 microm for NB4 and K562 cells, respectively. This activity was higher than that of the reference compound dequalinium (DQA). Apoptosis and necrosis induced by HB2 in both NB4 and K562 cell lines were analysed by Annexin V/PI labeling. Mitochondrial alterations including reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and mitochondrial transmembrane potential (DeltaPsim) were also tested. The results demonstrated that HB2 induced cell death by apoptosis and necrosis and showed enhanced cytotoxic effects in combination with DQA. Besides, HB2 induced ROS overproduction in NB4 cells and a slight decrease of DeltaPsim. Consequently, our findings prompt further studies on the HB2 mechanism of action and its selectivity to tumor cells in order to assess the potential of HB2 as an agent for cancer treatment.","['Departamento de Bioquimica y Biologia Molecular, Facultad de Medicina, Campus Universitario, Universidad de Alcala, 28871 Alcala de Henares, Madrid, Spain. svela@uns.edu.ar']",,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Retrospective analysis of clinical data from 53 consecutive children who received UDT from November 2002 to December 2007 in our center. RESULTS: The median recipient age was 8.4 years (range 1.5-21). With a median follow-up of 36 months (range 18-80), the probability of 3-year overall survival (OS) was 71.5%. Treatment-related mortality (TRM) was 19.0%, and 9.5% died after post-transplant leukemia relapse. Incidence of grades I-II, III-IV acute and chronic graft versus host disease (GVHD) was 63%, 29%, and 46%. There was significant difference in OS between patients older or younger than 10 years (50.0% vs. 84.8%, P = 0.003), patients with different underlying diseases (ALL, AML, CML, and non-malignant disease: 36.4%, 80.0%, 61.5%, and 100%, P = 0.001) and patients receiving either HLA 0-1 versus 2-3 loci high-resolution mismatched UDT (83.3% vs. 53.3%, P = 0.034). The OS was not affected by the stem cell source (peripheral stem cell 70.3%, bone marrow 87.5% vs. cord blood 62.5%, P = 0.542) or the severity of acute GVHD (grade 0-II 77.8% vs. grade III-IV 60.0%, P = 0.140). CONCLUSIONS: The important prognostic factors for OS after UDT were the degree of HLA match, the age of patient and the type of underlying disease. Patients < 10-year with non-malignant disease receiving 0-1 locus high-resolution mismatched UDT had the most favorable outcomes.","[""Department of Hematology/Oncology, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China. chenjingscmc@hotmail.com""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As little is known about their dietary or nutrient intake that may affect their long-term bone health, we examined nutrient intake in long-term survivors of childhood ALL. PROCEDURE: Survivors (n = 164) of childhood ALL who had completed treatment for at least 5 years and were in continuous remission, completed a 110-item food questionnaire that reflected dietary intake over the previous year. The analyzed cohort comprised 34 females and 38 males younger than 19 years and 45 females and 47 males at least 19 years. Reported nutrient intake and food selection were compared with age-specific Recommended Dietary Allowance and USDA Pyramid Food Guide. Body mass index was compared to the general US population, adjusted for age, gender, Tanner stage and race. RESULTS: Less than 30% of participants met recommended dietary intakes for vitamin D, calcium, potassium, or magnesium regardless of age. Mean daily caloric intake was 2,204 kcal (51% from carbohydrates) for younger and 2,160 kcal (49% from carbohydrates) for older participants. Energy intake from sweets was 70% higher than recommended.

Although mutation types A, B, and D represent the majority of cases, rare mutation variants of the NPM1 gene in individual patients do occur. In this study, we have evaluated a novel, DNA-based real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR) for the detection of three of the most commonly occurring mutations and for six rare patient-specific mutation types, which represent 28% of all of the NPM1 mutations in our group of 25 CN-AML patients. Furthermore, the prognostic relevance of NPM1-based monitoring of minimal residual disease (MRD) in peripheral blood (PB), bone marrow (BM), and in specific cell subsets (CD34(+), CD34(-), CD34(dim)) of BM were evaluated. In 80% of the evaluable patients, a molecular relapse preceded a hematological relapse. Moreover, in this subset of patients, the molecular relapse occurred at a median of 97 days before the hematological relapse. Our compartment analysis showed a strong correlation between BM and PB (r = 0.907, P < 0.001) as well as a high copy number of mutated NPM1 in CD34(+) BM cells. In conclusion, we have demonstrated applicability of our presented RQ-PCR method for a large percentage of mutated NPM1 patients with CN-AML as well as the usefulness for long-term follow-up monitoring of MRD and the prediction of hematological relapse.","['Department of Internal Medicine-Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Brno and Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.']",,,,,"['(c) 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using microRNA microarrays, we characterized the microRNA gene expression of 27 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with normal cytogenetics, focusing on the microRNAs differentially expressed between the M1 and M5 French-American-British (FAB) subtypes. An accurate delineation of these two AML entities was observed based on the expression of 12 microRNAs. We hypothesized that these microRNAs may potentially be involved in the differentiation block of M1 blasts and consequently monocytic differentiation. Using publically available mRNA data and microRNA target prediction software, we identified several key myeloid factors that may be targeted by our candidate microRNAs. The expression changes of the candidate microRNAs during monocytic differentiation of AML cell lines treated with Vitamin D and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate were examined. All six candidate microRNAs were significantly down-regulated over the time course by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction suggesting a link between these microRNAs and monocytic differentiation. To further characterize these microRNAs, we confirmed by luciferase assays that these microRNA target several key myeloid factors such as MAFB, IRF8, and KLF4 identifying a possible mechanism for the control of differentiation by these microRNAs.","[""Blood, Stem Cells and Cancer Research, St Vincent Centre for Applied Medical Research, St Vincent's Hospital and St Vincent's Clinical School, University of New South Wales, Darlinghurst, NSW, Australia.""]",,,,,"['(c) 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thymiplatin significantly induced an apoptotic response, which was found to be associated with the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and with caspase activation. The activity was shown to be independent of Fas-associated protein with death domain (FADD), but dependent on Bcl-2 expression. As a consequence, for thymiplatin a mitochondrial mode of action could be assigned. Moreover, the compound showed activity in cells resistant to common drugs, such as daunorubicin and vincristin, and showed synergistic effects with doxorubicin, vincristin, cytarabin, and daunorubicin.","[""Children's Hospital of the City of Cologne, Amsterdamerstr. 59, 507335 Cologne, Germany.""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2010 Oct 28.,"Our studies indicated that Tanshinone IIA (TanIIA), which is widely applied in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases with a rare occurrence of side effects, could promote APL cell differentiation and apoptosis. We found TanIIA induced the differentiation of NB4 and MR2 cells with elevated C/EBPbeta and CHOP. When C/EBPbeta was overexpressed in NB4 cells, the level of CD11b in the transfected cells was significantly elevated. When we used CHOP siRNA to suppress CHOP expression in NB4 cells and then treated these cells with a high concentration of TanIIA, the differentiation and apoptosis of these cells were both significantly increased. These data demonstrate that C/EBPbeta is critical for APL cell differentiation and apoptosis induced by TanIIA, and that CHOP acts as a negative regulator of C/EBPbeta activity. Our study suggested that TanIIA is a promising drug for treating newly diagnosed and ATRA-resistant APL, and a high concentration of TanIIA associated with inhibition of CHOP, maybe a potentially promising therapy strategy.","['Department of Hematology, West China Medical School, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610041, Sichuan, China.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Results showed that, compared with the CC group, glandular development advanced, the serum estradiol levels decreased significantly, and the glandular area and endometrial LIF and OPN expression were significantly higher in acupuncture group. There were no significant differences in serum progesterone levels, endometrial thickness, and stromal area between groups.

Epub 2010 Oct 19.,"Multiple myeloma (MM) is the second most commonly diagnosed hematological malignancy, characterized by a monoclonal proliferation of malignant cells in the bone marrow. Despite recent advances in treatment strategies, MM remains incurable and new therapeutical targets are needed. Recently forodesine, a purine nucleoside phosphorylase inhibitor, was found to induce apoptosis in leukemic cells of chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients by increasing the dGTP levels. We therefore tested whether forodesine was able to inhibit proliferation and/or induce apoptosis in both murine and human MM cells through a similar pathway. We found that after 48 hours of treatment with forodesine there was a slight dGTP increase in 5T33MM and RPMI-8226 MM cells associated with partial inhibition of proliferation and a limited induction of apoptosis. When investigating the pathways leading to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, we observed an upregulation of p27, caspase 3, and BIM. We can conclude that forodesine has some effects on MM cells but not as impressive as the known effects in leukemic cells. Forodesine might be however potentiating towards other established cytotoxic drugs in MM.","['Department of Hematology and Immunology, Myeloma Center Brussels, Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB), Laarbeeklaan 103, 1090 Brussels, Belgium.']",,PMC2963119,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For 95 of the patients, sufficient RNA was available before and after in vivo treatment to assess treatment-induced gene expression changes in ALL cells. After treatment, the median ADRB2 mRNA expression was ninefold lower in leukemia cells of patients who ultimately relapsed as compared with patients who remained in continuous complete remission (CCR). Polymorphisms in the ADRB2 promoter were significantly linked to methotrexate (MTX)-induced upregulation in ADRB2 gene expression in ALL cells. Moreover, the ADRB2 promoter haplotype was significantly related to early treatment response in 245 children with ALL who received uniform treatment.

To evaluate the relationship between steady-state trough plasma IM concentration (IM-C(min)) and clinical response in CML patients, we integrated data from six independent Japanese studies. Among 254 CML patients, the mean IM-C(min) was 1,010.5 ng/ml. Importantly, IM-C(min) was significantly higher in patients who achieved a major molecular response (MMR) than in those who did not (P = 0.002). Multivariate analysis showed that an MMR was associated with both age (odds ratio (OR) = 0.97 (0.958-0.995); P = 0.0153) and with IM-C(min) (OR = 1.0008 (1.0003-1.0015); P = 0.0044). Given that patients with IM-C(min) values >1,002 ng/ml had a higher probability of achieving an MMR in our large cohort (P = 0.0120), the data suggest that monitoring of IM levels in plasma may improve the efficacy of IM therapy for CML patients.","['Department of Hematology, Nephrology, and Rheumatology, Akita University Graduate School of Medicine, Akita, Japan. naotot@doc.med.akita-u.ac.jp']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2010 Oct 27.,"The molecular mechanisms regulating self-renewal of leukemia stem cells remain poorly understood. Here we report the generation of 2 closely related leukemias created through the retroviral overexpression of Meis1 and Hoxa9. Despite their apparent common origin, these clonal leukemias exhibit enormous differences in stem cell frequency (from 1 in 1.4, FLA2; to 1 in 347, FLB1), suggesting that one of these leukemias undergoes nearly unlimited self-renewal divisions. Using next-generation RNA-sequencing, we characterized the transcriptomes of these phenotypically similar, but biologically distinct, leukemias, identifying hundreds of differentially expressed genes and a large number of structural differences (eg, alternative splicing and promoter usage). Focusing on ligand-receptor pairs, we observed high expression levels of Sdf1-Cxcr4; Jagged2-Notch2/1; Osm-Gp130; Scf-cKit; and Bmp15-Tgfb1/2. Interestingly, the integrin beta 2-like gene (Itgb2l) is both highly expressed and differentially expressed between our 2 leukemias ( approximately 14-fold higher in FLA2 than FLB1). In addition, gene ontology analysis indicated G-protein-coupled receptor had a much higher proportion of differential expression (22%) compared with other classes ( approximately 5%), suggesting a potential role regulating subtle changes in cellular behavior. These results provide the first comprehensive transcriptome analysis of a leukemia stem cell and document an unexpected level of transcriptome variation between phenotypically similar leukemic cells.","['Institute for Research in Immunology and Cancer, University of Montreal, Montreal, Canada.']",['Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2010 Oct 27.,"Rfv3 is an autosomal dominant gene that influences the recovery of resistant mice from Friend retrovirus (FV) infection by limiting viremia and promoting a more potent neutralizing antibody response. We previously reported that Rfv3 is encoded by Apobec3, an innate retrovirus restriction factor. However, it was recently suggested that the Rfv3 susceptible phenotype of high viremia at 28 days postinfection (dpi) was more dominantly controlled by the B-cell-activating factor receptor (BAFF-R), a gene that is linked to but located outside the genetically mapped region containing Rfv3. Although one prototypical Rfv3 susceptible mouse strain, A/WySn, indeed contains a dysfunctional BAFF-R, two other Rfv3 susceptible strains, BALB/c and A.BY, express functional BAFF-R genes, determined on the basis of genotyping and B-cell immunophenotyping. Furthermore, transcomplementation studies in (C57BL/6 [B6] x BALB/c)F(1) and (B6 x A.BY)F(1) mice revealed that the B6 Apobec3 gene significantly influences recovery from FV viremia, cellular infection, and disease at 28 dpi. Finally, the Rfv3 phenotypes of prototypic B6, A.BY, A/WySn, and BALB/c mouse strains correlate with reported Apobec3 mRNA expression levels. Overall, these findings argue against the generality of BAFF-R polymorphisms as a dominant mechanism to explain the Rfv3 recovery phenotype and further strengthen the evidence that Apobec3 encodes Rfv3.","['Division of Infectious Diseases, University of Colorado Denver, Mail Stop B-168, 12700 E. 19th Avenue, Aurora, CO 80045, USA. mario.santiago@ucdenver.edu']","['R01 AI090795/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R56 AI084123/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 A065329/PHS HHS/United States', 'R01 AI090795-01/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R56 AI084123-01/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R56 AI-0841230/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3014173,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: LDL from healthy volunteers was obtained by density-gradient ultracentrifugation and was oxidized by incubation with Cu2+ and ox-LDL was identified.Macrophages were induced from THP-1 cell by phorbol ester (PMA). Models of foam cells were built by incubating macrophages with oxLDL. The effect of lovastatin and rosiglitazone on ABCA1 protein expression in THP-1 cell line derived macrophage were detected by western blot. Foam cells were divided into 9 groups: control, ApoA-I, lovastatin, rosiglitazone lovastatin+ApoA-I, rosiglitazone+ApoA-I, ABCA1 monoclonal antibody pretreatment+ApoA-I, ABCA1 monoclonal antibody pretreatment+lovastatin+ApoA-I, ABCA1 monoclonal antibody pretreatment+rosiglitazone+ApoA-I. The concentration of intracellular CHO in each group was detected by using cholesterol kit. RESULTS: As compared with control group, there are no big differences of CHO concentration within the cell of group lovastatin, rosiglitazone, and each ABCA1 monoclonal antibody pretreatment group (P>0.05), but the CHO concentration within the cells of group ApoA-I, lovastatin+ApoA-I, rosiglitazone+ApoA-I decreased obviously as compared with the control (P<0.05), and CHO concentration in group rosiglitazone+ApoA-I have a further decrease than the former two groups (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: CHO concentration can be decreased in foam cells by cooperation of ABCA1 and ApoA-I mediate cholesterol efflux. Rosiglitazone can enhance this procedure in THP-1 macrophages derived foam cells which means that they can promote ABCA1 mediated cholesterol reverse transportation through improve ABCA1 protein expression.","['Department of Cardiology, Affiliated Hospital of North Sichuan Medical College, Sichuan Nanchong 637000, China. doctor_lz@163.com']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Except for transplant-related organ toxicities, renal insufficiencies which emerge earlier significantly limit patients' long survival. To analyze risk factors for acute kidney injury (AKI), we conducted a retrospective cohort study of 96 patients undergoing HSCT. METHODS: During the first 100 days after allo-HSCT, all patients were evaluated for renal function by measuring serum creatinine clearance and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) with a classification below: Grade 0 (<25%, decline in creatinine clearance), Grade 1 (>/=25% decline in creatinine clearance but <2-fold increase in serum creatinine), Grade 2 (>/=2-fold rise in serum creatinine but no need for dialysis), and Grade 3 (>/=2-fold rise in serum creatinine and need for dialysis). Cox regression model was used to calculate the hazard ratios (HRs) of demographic data, clinical variables, and risk factors for AKI. RESULTS: Twenty-eight (29.2%) patients occurred Grades 1-3 renal dysfunction (Grade 1, 14 patients; Grade 2, 12 patients; Grade 3, 2 patients), and ratios of early kidney injury increased in high-risk malignancy group (HR = 2.945, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.293-6.421), patients treated with myeloablative conditioning regimen (HR=2.463, 95% CI=1.757-4.320), and patients with acute GVHD (HR=3.553, 95% CI=1.809-6.978), sepsis (HR=3.215, 95% CI=1.189-6.333 ), or hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) (HR=3.487, 95% CI=1.392-6.524). Whereas, HLA histocompatibility showed no striking increased risk for acute renal injury (HR=1.684, 95% CI=0.648-4.378). The survival rate was lower in patients with severe nephrotoxicity (21.4%) than in patients without nephrotoxicity (70.6%) (P=0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Nephrotoxicity is the primary risk factor for AKI, severely impacting on survival. Sorts of risk factors mentioned will be useful for evaluation for kidney function of patients undergoing allo-HSCT.","['Department of Hematology and Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, Zhongda Hospital, Southeast University School of Medicine, Nanjing, Jiangsu 210009, PR China.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have recently observed that GC resistance in T-ALL cell lines is associated with a proliferative metabolism and reduced expression of MLL. In this study we have further explored the relationship between MLL status and GC sensitivity. RESULTS: Negative correlation of MLL expression with GC resistance in 15 T-ALL cell lines was confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR. The absence of MLL-rearrangements suggested that this relationship represented expression of wild-type MLL. Analysis of MLL expression patterns revealed a negative relationship with cellular metabolism, proliferation and anti-apoptotic transcriptional networks. In silico analysis of published data demonstrated that reduced levels of MLL mRNA are associated with relapse and prednisolone resistance in T-ALL patients and adverse clinical outcome in children with MLL-rearranged ALL. RNAi knockdown of MLL expression in T-ALL cell lines significantly increased resistance to dexamethasone and gamma irradiation indicating an important role for wild-type MLL in the control of cellular apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: The data suggests that reduced expression of wild-type MLL can contribute to GC resistance in ALL patients both with and without MLL-translocations.","[""Division of Children's Leukaemia and Cancer Research, Telethon Institute for Child Health Research, University of Western Australia Centre for Child Health Research, Perth, Australia.""]",,PMC2987983,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We evaluated the frequency of NPM1 mutations in childhood AML, their relation to clinical and cytogenetic features and the presence of common FLT3 and RAS mutations. RESULTS: NPM1 mutations were found in 8% of cases. They involved the typical type 'A' mutation and one novel mutation characterized by two individual base pair substitutions, which resulted in 2 amino acid changes (W290) and (S293) in the NPM protein. FLT3/ITD mutations were observed in 12% of the cases and in one NPM1-mutated case bearing also t(8;21) (q22;q22). No common RAS mutations were identified. CONCLUSIONS: A relatively consistent NPM1 mutation rate was observed, but with variations in types of mutations.

Most patients have mutations in the SBDS gene. We previously reported that SBDS-deficient cells overexpress Fas, undergo accelerated spontaneous and Fas-mediated apoptosis and grow slowly. However the mechanism of how SBDS regulates apoptosis remains unknown. Several studies have shown that reactive oxygen species (ROS) regulate cell growth and spontaneous and Fas-mediated cell death. Therefore, we hypothesized that SBDS-deficiency disrupts ROS regulation and subsequently increases sensitivity to Fas stimulation and reduced cell growth. PROCEDURE: SBDS was knocked down in HeLa cervical cancer cells and TF-1 myeloid cells using short hairpin RNA. ROS levels were evaluated by oxidation of 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate. Apoptosis and cell growth were evaluated with and without antioxidants by annexin V/propidium iodide and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assays, respectively. RESULTS: We found that shRNA mediated SBDS-knockdown resulted in a significant increase in ROS levels compared to control cells. Fas stimulation further increased ROS levels in the SBDS-knockdown HeLa cells more than in the controls. Importantly, balancing ROS levels by antioxidants rescued SBDS-deficient cells from spontaneous and Fas-mediated apoptosis and reduced cell growth. CONCLUSIONS: ROS levels are increased in SBDS-deficient cells, which leads to increased apoptosis and decreased cell growth. Increased baseline and Fas-mediated ROS levels in SBDS-deficient cells can enhance the sensitivity to Fas stimulation. By balancing ROS levels, antioxidants can improve cell growth and survival in SBDS-deficient cells.","['Cell Biology Program, Research Institute, The Hospital for Sick Children, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['HPA161281/Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Infection with malarial parasite is a possibility in regions that are endemic for malaria. Over-diagnosis and over-treatment of malaria is increasingly being recognized as a serious concern in malaria endemic regions. Aim was to determine the incidence of malarial infection in episodes of FN in children receiving chemotherapy for malignant disorders. METHODS: Children, with malignant disorders, on chemotherapy, who fulfilled the definition of FN were enrolled prospectively. Standard microscopy, quantitative buffy coat, and antigen detection (OptiMAL) were performed in each episode of FN. RESULTS: One hundred episodes of FN involving 82 children were investigated. The age ranged from 2 to 13 years (mean: 5.8 +/- 2.8). Eighty-one episodes were in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, 15 in acute myeloid leukemia, and remaining 4 in other malignancies. Evidence for malaria was not found in any case by any of the three methods. CONCLUSIONS: Malaria was not found to be a causative agent for FN in children with various malignant disorders, in a region with low endemicity for malaria. Presumptive administration of antimalarials in children with FN is unjustified. Pediatric oncologists constantly face the challenge of managing febrile illnesses in immunocompromised patients. Those practicing in malaria endemic regions can effectively exploit diagnostic tools for malaria for a rational decision.","['Hematology-Oncology Unit, Department of Pediatrics, Advanced Pediatrics Centre, Chandigarh, India. deepakritu@yahoo.com']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Differentiating between leukemia and transient myeloproliferative disorder (TMD) in phenotypically normal infants is sometimes difficult. The clinical features and molecular analyses for the fusion transcripts of mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) gene rearrangement in infant leukemia have not been well documented in the Chinese population. PROCEDURE: Forty-five consecutive infants diagnosed with leukemia between 1995 and 2007 in a tertiary medical center in Taiwan were studied. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) was diagnosed in 23 infants, acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in 21 (including TMD in 4), and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) in 1. RESULTS: The median white count at diagnosis was higher in ALL than in AML (154.4 x 10(9)/l vs. 58.3 x 10(9)/l, P = 0.05). Chromosome 11q23/MLL abnormalities were present in 77% of ALL and 31% of AML. The 5-year event-free survival (EFS) in infant ALL and AML showed no difference (18% vs. 12%, respectively). The only independent predictor of an adverse prognosis among infants diagnosed with ALL was high presenting white count >/= 100 x 10(9)/l (P = 0.05). However, no factor was associated with an adverse outcome for infants with AML. CONCLUSIONS: The molecular assessments and prognostic factors of infant leukemia in Taiwan mirror those in developed Western countries.

Epub 2010 Oct 26.,"BACKGROUND: Mounting evidence points to the efficacy of donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) and immunisation with tumour-pulsed dendritic cells (DC) in generating graft vs leukaemia reactions after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT). We assessed the efficacy of DLI and DC in generating potent graft vs neuroblastoma tumour (GVT) reactions following allogeneic BMT. METHODS: Mice bearing congenic (H2K(a)) Neuro-2a tumours were grafted with allogeneic (H2K(b)) T-cell-depleted bone marrow cells. Tumour-pulsed donor DC (DC(Neuro2a)) were inoculated (on day +7) in conjunction with donor (H2K(b)) and haploidentical (H2K(a/b)) lymphocytes. RESULTS: Murine Neuro-2a cells elicit immune reactions as efficient as B lymphoma in major histocompatibility complex antigen-disparate mice. Lymphopenia induced by conditioning facilitates GVT, and transition to adaptive immunity is enhanced by simultaneous infusion of and DC(Neuro2a) and lymphocytes devoid of graft vs host (GVH) activity (H2K(a/b)). In variance, the efficacy of DC-mediated immunomodulation was diminished by severe graft vs host disease (GVHD), showing mechanistic dissociation and antagonising potential to GVT. CONCLUSIONS: The GVHD is not a prerequisite to induce GVT reactivity after allogeneic BMT, but is rather detrimental to induction of anti-tumour immunity by DC-mediated immunomodulation. Simultaneous inoculation of tumour-pulsed donor DC and DLI synergise in stimulation of potent GVT reactions to the extent of eradication of established NB tumours.","[""Department of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Schneider Children's Medical Center of Israel, Petach Tikva 49202, Israel.""]",,PMC2990575,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is involved in the regulation of different cytokines and growth factors and plays an important role in the diagnosis and treatment of myeloproliferative neoplasms (Smith et al., 2008). Translocations involving the JAK2 locus are uncommon with just a few cases described in the literature, and they usually lead to a fusion protein with JAK2 (Patnaik et al., 2010). Chromosome 9p24 abnormalities have been described in myeloid and lymphoid neoplasms including chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), acute megakaryoblastic leukemia, CD10+ B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, T-cell ALL and chronic myeloproliferative disorders (CMD) (Smith et al., 2008; Lacronique et al., 1997). Although the breakpoints of each translocation are known, characterization of the partner gene has not been done in many of the cases reported due to insufficient sample or other factors. In the present study we review all translocations involving JAK2 that have been reported in the literature.","['Clinical Cytogenetics Program, University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, TX.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2010 Oct 26.,"The discovery of new uses for older, clinically approved drugs is one way to expedite drug development for cancer. Thiocolchicoside, a semisynthetic colchicoside from the plant Gloriosa superba, is a muscle relaxant and used to treat rheumatologic and orthopedic disorders because of its analgesic and anti-inflammatory mechanisms. Given that activation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB plays a major role in inflammation and tumorigenesis, we postulated that thiocolchicoside would inhibit NF-kappaB and exhibit anticancer effects through the modulation of NF-kappaB-regulated proteins. We show that thiocolchicoside inhibited proliferation of leukemia, myeloma, squamous cell carcinoma, breast, colon, and kidney cancer cells. Formation of tumor colonies was also suppressed by thiocolchicoside. The colchicoside induced apoptosis, as indicated by caspase-3 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage, and suppressed the expression of cell survival [e.g., Bcl-2, X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP), MCL-1, bcl-xL, cIAP-1, cIAP-2, and cFLIP] proteins. Cell proliferation biomarkers such as c-MYC and phosphorylation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase and glycogen synthase kinase 3beta were also blocked by thiocolchicoside. Because most cell survival and proliferation gene products are regulated by NF-kappaB, we studied the effect of thiocolchicoside on this transcription factor and found that thiocolchicoside inhibited NF-kappaB activation, degradation of inhibitory kappaBalpha (IkappaBalpha), IkappaBalpha ubiquitination, and phosphorylation, abolished the activation of IkappaBalpha kinase, and suppressed p65 nuclear translocation. This effect of thiocolchicoside on the NF-kappaB pathway led to inhibition of NF-kappaB reporter activity and cyclooxygenase-2 promoter activity. Our results indicate that thiocolchicoside exhibits anticancer activity through inhibition of NF-kappaB and NF-kappaB-regulated gene products, which provides novel insight into a half-century old drug.","['Cytokine Research Laboratory, Department of Experimental Therapeutics, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']","['P01 CA124787/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA124787-01A2/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-16 672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-124787-01A2/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3142676,['NIHMS307535'],,['(c)2010 AACR.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2010 Oct 25.,"NK cells play an important role in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT) and in cross talk with dendritic cells (DCs) to induce primary T cell response against infection. Therefore, we hypothesized that blood DCs should augment NK cell function and reduce the risk of leukemia relapse after HCT. To test this hypothesis, we conducted laboratory and clinical studies in parallel. We found that although, phenotypically, NK cells could induce DC maturation and DCs could in turn increase activating marker expression on NK cells, paradoxically, both BDCA1(+) myeloid DCs and BDCA4(+) plasmacytoid DCs suppressed the function of NK cells. Patients who received an HLA-haploidentical graft containing a larger number of BDCA1(+) DCs or BDCA4(+) DCs had a higher risk of leukemia relapse and poorer survival. Further experiments indicated that the potent inhibition on NK cell cytokine production and cytotoxicity was mediated in part through the secretion of IL-10 by BDCA1(+) DCs and IL-6 by BDCA4(+) DCs. These results have significant implications for future HCT strategies.","[""Division of Bone Marrow Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee 38105-2794, USA.""]","['P30 CA021765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA021765-24/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA-21765-24/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3047596,['NIHMS249299'],,"['Copyright (c) 2011 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2010 Oct 25.,"OBJECTIVE: Multiple myeloma (MM) cells are extremely resistant to drug-induced apoptosis due to both intrinsic- and bone marrow (BM) microenvironment-dependent drug resistance particularly supported by bone cells. Growing evidence suggest that the osteoclast inhibitor zoledronic acid (ZOL) exerts both indirect and direct anti-tumoral effects, including an in vitro proapoptotic effect on MM cells, although this property has not yet been clearly observed in MM patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, we attempt to better define the cytotoxic effect of ZOL on MM cells in order to identify novel drug combinations able to potentiate its proapoptotic effect. RESULTS: Our data shows that ZOL at concentrations ranging from 10 to 100 muM was able to induce MM cell apoptosis overcoming the prosurvival effect of both stromal cells and osteoclasts and independent of the intrinsic bortezomib resistance of MM cells. Interestingly, we found that the capacity of ZOL to induce apoptosis in bortezomib-resistant cells was associated with a downregulation of the proapoptotic molecule myeloid cell leukemia-1. A transcriptional analysis by microarray was also performed to identify genes specifically modulated by ZOL in bortezomib-resistant MM cells. Finally, we show an additive effect of arsenic trioxide on apoptosis when used in combination with ZOL. CONCLUSIONS: Our in vitro data suggest that the use of ZOL at appropriate doses could be explored clinically in bortezomib-resistant MM patients and combined with arsenic trioxide to increase its proapoptotic effect.","['Hematology and BMT Center, University of Parma, Parma, Italy.']",,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2011 ISEH - Society for Hematology and Stem Cells.

DESIGN: Descriptive, retrospective cohort study. METHOD: Data were collected from the Netherlands Stem Cell Transplantation Registry TYPHON. Details of all transplant patients were reported to TYPHON by the individual transplantation centres. In this overview we describe the changes in transplantation-related mortality, relapse rates and survival in the periods 1 January 1980-31 December 1992 and 1 January 1980-31 December 2002. RESULTS: The number of autologous stem cell transplantations increased almost five-fold in the period 1993-2002. Since 1993 the main indications for transplantation were multiple myeloma (MM) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), as well as acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), which was the main indication in the period before 1993. In the period before 1993 most relapses were observed in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) and MM, which resulted in low survival rates. After 1993 no great differences in relapse or survival rates were observed between the different disorders. The survival rates for patients with ALL improved during the last research period, especially among younger patients (< 45 years). CONCLUSION: The number of autologous stem cell transplantations has increased considerably since 1993, especially in patients with MM and NHL.","['Universitair Medisch Centrum Groningen, afd.

Epub 2010 Oct 26.,"BACKGROUND: Anemia is an early indicator of many diseases, yet blood donors with low hematocrit (Hct) often receive inadequate information about its medical importance. We sought to understand the types of information that are and should be provided to these donors. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Two companion studies were performed. The first investigated blood center practices for care of donors with low Hct including deferral length, information provided, and cutoff values used when referring donors for medical attention. The second was a randomized prospective pilot study comparing behavior of deferred donors receiving an ""older"" pamphlet providing a list of iron-rich foods or a ""newer"" pamphlet providing descriptions of common causes of anemia and advice for seeking medical attention. RESULTS: More than 70% of centers defer donors for 1 day. Only 6% defer donors for more than 2 weeks. Most centers provide written and/or verbal information about low Hct. Only 35% have a cutoff value defining significant anemia that requires additional medical attention. In the study of donors with low Hct, significant disease was identified within 3 months after deferral in 2 of 104 subjects: metastatic lung cancer and acute lymphocytic leukemia. Only donors receiving the newer pamphlet reported that it ""definitely improved"" their ability to speak with their doctor about anemia. CONCLUSIONS: The diagnosis of anemia in blood donors may be an indicator of significant undiagnosed disease. There are wide variations in how centers care for and educate donors with anemia. Donors with anemia should be provided improved and consistent educational information.","['Puget Sound Blood Center, Seattle, Washington, USA.']",['R01 HL105809/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC3608117,['NIHMS449899'],,['(c) 2010 American Association of Blood Banks.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Inter-individual variation in imatinib pharmacokinetics is extensive, and influences drug safety and efficacy. Hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 has been implicated in imatinib N-demethylation, but the clearance of imatinib decreases during prolonged therapy. CYP3A phenotype correlates with imatinib clearance at the commencement of therapy, but not at steady state. The present study evaluated the possibility that multiple CYPs may contribute to imatinib oxidation in liver. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Imatinib biotransformation in human liver microsomes (n= 20) and by cDNA-expressed CYPs was determined by LC-MS. Relationships between imatinib N-demethylation and other drug metabolizing CYPs were assessed. KEY RESULTS: N-desmethylimatinib formation was correlated with microsomal oxidation of the CYP3A4 substrates testosterone (rho= 0.60; P < 0.01) and midazolam (rho= 0.46; P < 0.05), and the CYP2C8 substrate paclitaxel (rho= 0.58; P < 0.01). cDNA-derived CYPs 2C8, 3A4, 3A5 and 3A7 supported imatinib N-demethylation, but 10 other CYPs were inactive; in kinetic studies, CYP2C8 was a high-affinity enzyme with a catalytic efficiency approximately 15-fold greater than those of CYPs 3A4 and 3A5. The CYP3A inhibitors ketoconazole and troleandomycin, and the CYP2C8 inhibitors quercetin and paclitaxel decreased imatinib oxidation. From molecular modelling, the imatinib structure could be superimposed on a pharmacophore for CYP2C8 substrates. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: CYP2C8 and CYPs 3A contribute to imatinib N-demethylation in human liver. The involvement of CYP2C8 may account in part for the wide inter-patient variation in imatinib pharmacokinetics observed in clinical practice.","['Pharmacogenomics and Drug Development Group, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Sydney, NSW, Australia.']",,PMC2998687,,,"['(c) 2010 The Authors.

However, the effect of LL-37 against malignant skin cancer has not been reported. OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether the human cathelicidin LL-37 is involved in the carcinogenesis of various skin tumours. METHODS: Human cationic antimicrobial protein-18 (hCAP-18)/LL-37 production in several cell lines including HaCaT, a chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML) cell line and various melanoma cell lines was examined using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Immunohistochemical analysis of melanoma, nonmelanoma skin cancer and precancerous and benign skin lesions was performed. After adding LL-37 to a melanoma cell line, tumour cell proliferation, migration and invasion were investigated. RESULTS: Human malignant melanoma cell lines overexpressed hCAP-18/LL-37 mRNA and peptide compared with HaCaT and CML cell lines. Immunohistochemistry showed that the peptide was strongly expressed in malignant melanoma and moderately expressed in squamous cell carcinoma, whereas basal cell carcinoma, precancerous lesions and seborrhoeic keratosis showed no or weak expression. LL-37 also stimulated melanoma cell proliferation, migration and invasion in vitro. CONCLUSIONS: Cathelicidin LL-37 was primarily expressed in human malignant skin cancer. LL-37 promoted melanoma cell proliferation, migration and invasion in vitro. We report that an increase in the level of LL-37 is associated with malignant skin tumours such as malignant melanoma. These results highlight the importance of LL-37 in the malignant tendency of skin tumours.","['Department of Dermatology, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, 62 Youido-dong, Youngdeunpo-gu, Seoul 15-713, Korea.']",,,,,['(c) 2010 The Authors.

Axl basal transcriptional activity is driven by Sp1/Sp3, and overexpression of MZF-1 (myeloid zinc-finger 1) induces Axl transcription and gene expression. Furthermore, Axl expression is epigenetically controlled by CpG hypermethylation; however, little is known about inducible Axl gene expression and Axl regulation in haematopoetic malignancies. RESULTS: In the present study, we studied Axl transcriptional regulation under PMA-stimulated conditions in leukaemia cells. Luciferase analysis with sequential 5'-deletion constructs revealed that the -660/-580 region of the Axl promoter is indispensable for induced promoter activity under PMA stimulation. This region includes AP-1 (activator protein 1)/CREB [CRE (cAMP-response-element)-binding protein] motifs, five times partially overlapping TGCGTG repeats and multiple GT repeats. Mutational, supershift and ChIP (chromatin immunoprecipitation) analysis determined that AP-1 family members bind to AP-1 motifs and to the 5 x TGCGTG overlapping repeats, thus transactivating Axl promoter activity. Furthermore, specific inhibitors of PKC (protein kinase C), ERK1/2 (extracellular-signal-regulated kinase 1/2) and p38 reduced Axl expression. Additionally, mithramycin treatment abolished constitutive and PMA-induced Axl expression. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together the results of the present study suggest that PMA-induced Axl gene expression in leukaemia cells is mediated by AP-1 motifs and 5 x TGCGTG repeats within the promoter region -660/-580, and through the PKC/ERK1/2/AP-1 or PKC/p-38/AP-1 signalling axis.","['Department of Experimental Surgery Mannheim/Molecular Oncology of Solid Tumors, DKFZ and University of Heidelberg, Mannheim 68167, Germany.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2010 Oct 26.,"As the phenotype of a given single-gene mutation in mice is modulated by the genetic background of the inbred strain, embryonic stem (ES) cells derived from various inbred mouse strains are required to produce gene-targeted mice without the need for backcrossing and for detailed analysis of gene function in vivo. Here, we performed a comparative investigation of the effects of three culture conditions, LIF + KSR/ES medium described previously, High LIF + KSR/ES medium and iSTEM + LIF medium containing three inhibitors of glycogen synthase kinase 3, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase, and fibroblast growth factor receptor signaling (3i), on the establishment of germline-competent ES cells derived from strains BALB/c and NZB mice. The results indicated that LIF + KSR/ES medium was permissive for the derivation of ES cells from NZB mice, which contribute to the somatic lineage in vivo, but not to the germline lineage. In contrast, ES cells that contribute to the makeup of chimeric mice were not propagated from blastocysts of BALB/c mice. Both germline and somatic competency were improved by increased LIF concentration in cultures of BALB/c ES cells, although we failed to establish germline-competent NZB ES cells using the same concentration of LIF. Unexpectedly, iSTEM + LIF medium containing 3i showed a negative effect on the derivation of NZB ES cells with normal chromosome numbers, but not on the maintenance of previously established ES cells. Our findings suggest that the stability of pluripotency in the inner cell mass isolated from blastocyst embryos may differ according to the genetic background of inbred mouse strains, and that although the concentration of LIF is a determinant for authentic pluripotency, including germline and somatic competency in BALB/c ES cells, additional factor(s) are required for commitment to germline lineage independent of somatic lineage in NZB ES cells.","['Laboratory Animal Resource Center, University of Tsukuba , Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2010 Dec 8.,"Within the immune system there is an exquisite ability to discriminate between ""self"" and ""non-self"" that is orchestrated by antigen-specific T lymphocytes. Genomic plasticity enables differentiation of naive CD4+ T lymphocytes into either regulatory cells (Treg) that express the transcription factor Foxp3 and actively prevent autoimmune self-destruction or effector cells (Teff) that attack and destroy their cognate target. An example of such plasticity is our recent discovery that leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) supports Treg maturation in contrast to IL-6, which drives development of the pathogenic Th17 effector phenotype. This has revealed a LIF/IL6 axis in T cell development which can be exploited for modulation using targeted cytokine delivery. Here we demonstrate that LIF-loaded nanoparticles (NPs) directed to CD4+ T cells (i) oppose IL6-driven Th17 development; (ii) prolong survival of vascularized heart grafts in mice; and (iii) expand FOXP3+ CD4+ T cell numbers in a non-human primate model in vitro. In contrast, IL-6 loaded nanoparticles directed to CD4+ T cells increase Th17 development. Notably, nanoparticle-mediated delivery was demonstrated to be critical: unloaded nanoparticles and soluble LIF or IL-6 controls failed to recapitulate the efficacy of cytokine-loaded nanoparticles in induction and/or expansion of Foxp3+ cells or Th17 cells. Thus, this targeted nanoparticle approach is able to harness endogenous immune-regulatory pathways, providing a powerful new method to modulating T cell developmental plasticity in immune-mediated disease indications.","['Department of Biomedical Engineering, Yale University, Malone Engineering Center, New Haven, Connecticut 06511, USA.']","['U19 AI082713-02/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'U19 AI082713-01/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'U19 AI082713-03/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'U19 AI082713/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'FSH001/Department of Health/United Kingdom', 'P01 AI041521/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3040098,['NIHMS257559'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unlike 4-HPR and other retinoids, 4-oxo-4-HPR inhibits tubulin polymerization, leading to multipolar spindle formation and mitotic arrest. Here we investigated whether 4-oxo-4-HPR, like 4-HPR, triggered cell death also via reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and whether its antimicrotubule activity was related to a ROS-dependent mechanism in ovarian (A2780), breast (T47D), cervical (HeLa) and neuroblastoma (SK-N-BE) cancer cell lines. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We provided evidence that 4-oxo-4-HPR, besides acting as an antimicrotubule agent, induced apoptosis through a signaling cascade starting from ROS generation and involving endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response, Jun N-terminal Kinase (JNK) activation, and upregulation of the proapoptotic PLAcental Bone morphogenetic protein (PLAB). Through time-course analysis and inhibition of the ROS-related signaling pathway (upstream by vitamin C and downstream by PLAB silencing), we demonstrated that the antimitotic activity of 4-oxo-4-HPR was independent from the oxidative stress induced by the retinoid. In fact, ROS generation occurred earlier than mitotic arrest (within 30 minutes and 2 hours, respectively) and abrogation of the ROS-related signaling pathway did not prevent the 4-oxo-4-HPR-induced mitotic arrest. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These data indicate that 4-oxo-4-HPR anticancer activity is due to at least two independent mechanisms and provide an explanation of the ability of 4-oxo-4-HPR to be more potent than the parent drug and to be effective also in 4-HPR-resistant cell lines. In addition, the double mechanism of action could allow 4-oxo-4-HPR to efficiently target tumour and to eventually counteract the development of drug resistance.","['Department of Experimental Oncology and Molecular Medicine, Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori, Milan, Italy. paola.tiberio@istitutotumori.mi.it']",,PMC2954786,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There are only a few reports of other processes identified with SLL/CLL. The aim of this study was to review the fine needle aspiration (FNA) and touch prep (TP) diagnoses of SLL/CLL in order to identify any coincident entities. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed all FNA and TP cytology cases between January 2005 and May 2009 with a diagnosis of SLL/CLL to determine the presence of any coincident process. RESULTS: We identified 29 cases, including 23 FNAs and six TPs, from 23 patients. Ancillary studies were utilized in 97% of the cases, including flow cytometry (FC, 79%), immunohistochemistry (IHC, 55%), fluorescent in situ hybridization studies (24%) and special stains (7%). Coincident entities were identified in nine cases (31%) and included seven (28%) neoplastic entities (Hodgkin lymphoma [HL], adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, seminoma) and two (7%) non-neoplastic entities (infection and immunoglobulin containing cells). Six cases (21%) suspicious for large cell transformation were also identified. CONCLUSION: In our review of SLL/CLL, coincident entities were present in 31% of the cases and included a spectrum of non-neoplastic and neoplastic processes. FC was the most frequently utilized ancillary test, but IHC provided important information by excluding a mantle cell lymphoma or confirming a coincident process. Thus, cytomorphologic evaluation in these patients is important due to the high risk of a coincident process that may not be apparent by FC alone and may require clinical management.","['Department of Pathology, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA.']",,PMC2955352,,,,,,,,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'SLL/CLL', 'cytopathology', 'small lymphocytic lymphoma']",,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We constructed and expressed fusion protein of C5a and maltose binding protein. Efficacy of specific C5a neutralization was tested using the fusion protein as vaccine in three different arthritis mouse models: collagen induced arthritis (CIA), chronic relapsing CIA and collagen antibody induced arthritis (CAIA). Levels of anti-C5a antibodies and anti-collagen type II were measured by ELISA. C5a neutralization assay was done using a rat basophilic leukemia cell-line transfected with the human C5aR. Complement activity was determined using a hemolytic assay and joint morphology was assessed by histology. RESULTS: Vaccination of mice with MBP-C5a led to significant reduction of arthritis incidence and severity but not anti-collagen antibody synthesis. Histology of the MBP-C5a and control (MBP or PBS) vaccinated mice paws confirmed the vaccination effect. Sera from the vaccinated mice developed C5a-specific neutralizing antibodies, however C5 activation and formation of the membrane attack complex by C5b were not significantly altered. CONCLUSIONS: Exploitation of host immune response to generate sustained C5a neutralizing antibodies without significantly compromising C5/C5b activity is a useful strategy for developing an effective vaccine for antibody mediated and C5a dependent inflammatory diseases. Further developing of such a therapeutic vaccine would be more optimal and cost effective to attenuate inflammation without affecting host immunity.","['Medical Inflammation Research, Department of Experimental Medicine, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.

Bepotastine besilate significantly inhibited SP-induced degranulation of RBL-2H3 cells and NO synthesis in HMVECs. Bepotastine besilate significantly inhibited expression of adhesion molecules in HMVESs, while it failed to suppress SP-induced upregulation of the adhesion molecules in HMVECs. Therefore, bepotastine besilate is assumed to act favorably on SP-induced basophil degranulation and NO synthesis in HMVECs.","['Course of Integrated Medicine, Department of Dermatology, Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka University, 2-2 Yamadaoka, Suita-Shi, Osaka 565-0871, Japan.']",,PMC2958303,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Novel anti-CD20 mAbs with more potent cytotoxic activity have recently been engineered, but so far most have only been tested in vitro with natural killer (NK) cells from healthy donors. Because it is still unclear whether these optimized cytotoxic mAbs will improve NK-cell killing of tumor cells in CLL patients, we characterized the relevant phenotypic and functional features of NK cells from CLL patients in detail. Expression of inhibitory and activating NK-cell receptors and of Fc gamma receptor IIIA (FcgammaRIIIA) is well preserved in CD16(+)CD56(dim) cytotoxic NK cells from these patients, independently of disease progression. These cells are fully functional following cytokine stimulation. In addition, the FcgammaRIIIA-optimized LFB-R603 anti-CD20 mAb mediates 100 times greater antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity by NK cells from CLL patients and healthy donors than rituximab. Enhanced degranulation against autologous B-CLL cells is observed at lower concentrations of LFB-R603 than rituximab, regardless of CLL prognostic factors. These findings strongly justify further clinical development of anti-CD20 mAbs optimized for FcgammaR engagement in CLL patients.","[""INSERM, UMR-S 945, AP-HP, Hopital Pitie-Salpetriere, Service d'Hematologie Biologique, Paris, France. magali.legarff@psl.aphp.fr""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This review presents advances in diagnosis and therapy of LGL syndrome. RECENT FINDINGS: Due to the lack of a single unique genetic or phenotypic feature and clinicopathological overlap between reactive and neoplastic entities, accurate LGL syndrome diagnosis should be based on the combination of morphologic, immunophenotypic, and molecular studies as well as clinical features. For diagnosis and monitoring of LGL proliferations, it is essential to perform flow cytometric blood and/or bone marrow analysis using a panel of monoclonal antibodies to conventional and novel T-cell and NK-cell antigens such as NK-cell receptors and T-cell receptor beta-chain variable region families together with TCR gene rearrangement studies. Treatment of symptomatic cytopenias in patients with indolent LGL leukemia is still based on immunosuppressive therapy. Treatment with purine analogs and alemtuzumab may be considered as an alternative option. SUMMARY: Progress in understanding the pathogenetic mechanisms of these entities, especially resistance of clonal LGLs to apoptosis, due to constitutive activation of survival signaling pathways, has its impact on identification of potential molecular therapeutic targets.","['aDepartment of Pathomorphology, Institute of Hematology and Transfusion Medicine, Poland bDepartment of Pathomorphology, Institute of Rheumatology, Warsaw, Poland.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we investigated KU812 leukemia cells that express the fetal gamma-globin and adult beta-globin genes, as a system for screening and discovery of novel HbF inducers. KU812 cells were analyzed in the presence or absence of fetal bovine serum and then expression levels of the globin genes, cell surface markers and transcription factors were quantified by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). For comparison, primary erythroid cells were grown in a two-phase liquid culture system. After drug inductions for 48-72 h, globin mRNA and HbF levels were quantified by RT-qPCR and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, respectively. Erythroid markers and transcription factors expression levels in KU812 cells were comparable to days 7-14 erythroid cells. We also tested several drugs including butyrate, trichostatin A, scriptaid, suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid and hydroxyurea, which induced gamma-globin in KU812 cells; however, some agents also induced beta-globin. A novel agent STI-571 was studied in the system, which non-selectively induced the globin genes. Additional studies showed comparable globin gene response patterns in KU812 and primary erythroid cells after treatments with the various drug inducers. Mechanisms of drug-mediated gamma-globin induction in KU812 cells require signaling through the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway similar to that previously demonstrated in primary erythroid cells. These data suggest that KU812 cells serve as a good screening system to identify potential HbF inducers for the treatment of beta-hemoglobinopathies.","['Department of Neurology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX 75390, USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although low levels of soluble HLA molecules (sHLA) are normally released into the blood, many types of tumor cells release larger amounts of these sHLA molecules, presumably to counter immune surveillance by T cells. Here we demonstrate that these sHLA molecules are still bound with their authentic peptide repertoires, similar to those of the membranal HLA molecules (mHLA). Therefore, a single immunoaffinity purification of the plasma sHLA molecules, starting with a few milliliters of patients' blood, allows for identification of very large sHLA peptidomes by mass spectrometry, forming a foundation for development of a simple and universal blood-based cancer diagnosis. The new methodology was validated using plasma and tumor cells of multiple-myeloma and leukemia patients, plasma of healthy controls, and with cultured cancer cells. The analyses identified thousands of sHLA peptides, including some cancer-related peptides, present among the sHLA peptidomes of the cancer patients.

Epub 2010 Oct 25.,"All retroviral genomic RNAs contain a cis-acting packaging signal by which dimeric genomes are selectively packaged into nascent virions. However, it is not understood how Gag (the viral structural protein) interacts with these signals to package the genome with high selectivity. We probed the structure of murine leukemia virus RNA inside virus particles using SHAPE, a high-throughput RNA structure analysis technology. These experiments showed that NC (the nucleic acid binding domain derived from Gag) binds within the virus to the sequence UCUG-UR-UCUG. Recombinant Gag and NC proteins bound to this same RNA sequence in dimeric RNA in vitro; in all cases, interactions were strongest with the first U and final G in each UCUG element. The RNA structural context is critical: High-affinity binding requires base-paired regions flanking this motif, and two UCUG-UR-UCUG motifs are specifically exposed in the viral RNA dimer. Mutating the guanosine residues in these two motifs--only four nucleotides per genomic RNA--reduced packaging 100-fold, comparable to the level of nonspecific packaging. These results thus explain the selective packaging of dimeric RNA. This paradigm has implications for RNA recognition in general, illustrating how local context and RNA structure can create information-rich recognition signals from simple single-stranded sequence elements in large RNAs.","['Department of Chemistry, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC 27599-3290, USA.']","['R01 GM064803/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States', 'GM064803/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'N01CO12400/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-CO-12400/CO/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2984214,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2010 Oct 25.,"Expression of BCR-ABL oncoprotein in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) promotes neoplastic transformation of hematopoietic stem cells through modulation of diverse pathways. CML is a multistep disease, which evolves as a chronic phase and progresses to blast crisis. This progression has been associated with the appearance and accumulation of new cytogenetic anomalies and mutations. The mechanisms underlying the genomic instability promoted by BCR-ABL remain obscure. Through comparative analysis of different DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair mechanisms as a function of the BCR-ABL status in human megakaryocytic and CML cell lines, we found that BCR-ABL upregulates error-prone DSB repair pathways [single-strand annealing (SSA) and non-homologous end joining] rather than the high-fidelity mechanism of homologous recombination. Intriguingly, expression analysis of DSB repair pathway choice determining factors revealed increased levels of the protein CtIP in BCR-ABL-positive cells, particularly in response to irradiation. Moreover, treatment with the BCR-ABL kinase inhibitor, Imatinib Mesylate, abolished CtIP accumulation. When we silenced CtIP expression in cells with functional BCR-ABL, SSA enhancement by BCR-ABL was completely abrogated. Importantly, we also provide evidence that BCR-ABL stimulates DSB end resection, which is mediated by CtIP. Briefly, BCR-ABL promotes mutagenic DSB repair with the DSB end-processing protein CtIP acting as the key mediator downstream of BCR-ABL.","['Instituto de Biofisica Carlos Chagas Filho, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, Centro de Ciencias da Saude, Brazil. daniela.salles@inca.gov.br']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2010 Oct 25.,"Adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) is a T-cell malignancy associated with human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1). Mutations of tumor suppressor genes have been described in ATL. Although Tax, a product of HTLV-1, is associated with cellular genetic aberrations, the mechanisms of such association are not fully clear. Activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) is involved in somatic DNA alterations of the immunoglobulin gene for amplification of immune diversity. However, inappropriate expression of AID acts as a genomic mutator that contributes to tumorigenesis. To gain insight into the molecular mechanism underlying the emergence of somatic mutations in various genes during leukemogenesis, we examined the expression of AID. HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines and ATL cells expressed high levels of AID compared with uninfected T-cell lines and normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Immunohistochemistry showed AID-positive ATL cells in lymph nodes and skin lesions. Infection of a human T-cell line and normal PBMCs with HTLV-1 induced AID expression. Tax transcriptionally activated AID gene through both the nuclear factor-kappaB subunit p50 and cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate response element-binding protein signaling pathways. p50, which lacks a transactivation domain, interacted with the transcriptional coactivator Bcl-3 in HTLV-1-infected T cells. Thus, activation of p50/Bcl-3 complexes in T cells in response to Tax might explain the constitutive expression of AID in HTLV-1-infected T cells. The constitutive expression of AID in ATL cells can be speculated to result from mutations induced by the Tax-activated AID and/or other Tax-associated mutagenic mechanisms during the pre-leukemic stage, which cause functional modification within the AID promoter or in any of its cellular regulatory activator proteins.","['Department of Microbiology and Oncology, University of the Ryukyus, Nishihara, Okinawa, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of the present study was to characterize the antiproliferative effects of three synthetic solanidine analogs (1-3) on HL-60 human leukemia cells. The three compounds exerted similar cytostatic effects (IC(50) values: 1.27-2.94 muM after a 72-h exposure) and the most effective (2) was selected for further investigations. Incubation with compound 2 resulted in a marked chromatin condensation followed by a gradual increase in cell membrane permeability detected by Hoechst dye 33258-propidium iodide double staining. A flow cytometric analysis revealed a marked decrease in the G1 phase and substantial increases in the S and G2/M phases after 24-h incubation, while after 48 h the proportion of cells in the subG1 phase was increased significantly with a concomitant decrease in cells in the G1 and G2/M phases. Compound 2 at 6.0 muM significantly decreased the activity of ribonucleotide reductase and proved to be a potent antioxidant in the lipid peroxidation and DPPH assays (IC(50) values: 2.0 and 13.1 muM, respectively). The antiproliferative effect of the test compound on the non-cancerous human lung fibroblast cell line (MRC-5) was significantly weaker than that on the leukemia cells.

Due to the detailed documentation of their oncogenomic and transcriptional alterations via recent advances in molecular medicine, LL cell lines may be fitted to parent tumors with a degree of precision unattainable in other cancers. We have surveyed the corpus of published LL cell lines and found 637 examples that meet minimum standards of authentication and characterization. Alarmingly, the rate of establishment of new LL cell lines has plummeted over the last decade. Although the main hematopoietic developmental cell types are represented by cell lines, some LL categories stubbornly resist establishment in vitro. The advent of engineering techniques for immortalizing primary human cells that maintain differentiation means the time is ripe for renewed search for in vitro models from un(der)represented hematologic entities. Given their manifold applications in biomedicine, there is little doubt that LL-derived cell lines will continue to play a vital part well into the next half-century as well.","['DSMZ-German Collection of Microorganisms & Cell Cultures, Department of Human and Animal Cell Cultures, Braunschweig, Germany. hdr@dsmz.de']",,,,,['(c) 2010 The Authors.

Epub 2010 Oct 25.,"Vinblastine is a widely used anticancer drug with undesired side effects. Its conjugation with carrier molecules could be an efficient strategy to reduce these side effects. Besides this, the conjugate could exhibit increased efficiency against resistant cells, e.g., due to the altered internalization pathway. Oligoarginines, as cell-penetrating peptides, can transport covalently attached compounds into different kinds of cells and enhance the efficiency of those compounds. We report here the coupling of vinblastine through its carboxyl group at position 16 with the N-terminal amino function of L-Trp methyl ester. After hydrolysis of the ester group, 17-desacetylvinblastineTrp was conjugated to the N-terminal amino group of oligoarginine via the C-terminal carboxyl group of the Trp moiety in solution. The antitumor effect of conjugates was studied on sensitive and resistant human leukemia (HL-60) cells in vitro. Our data suggest that all conjugates investigated possess an antiproliferative effect against the studied cells. However, the effect was dependent on the number of Arg residues in the conjugates: Arg(8) > Arg(6) >> Arg(4). The conjugate with Arg(8) exhibited similar efficicacy as compared with free 17-desacetylvinblastineTrp. The in vitro studies also showed that the tubulin binding ability of vinblastine was essentially preserved even in the octaarginine conjugate. We also observed that two isomers were formed during conjugation. These isomers showed different levels of activity against tubulin polymerization in vitro and in vivo. The 17-desacetylvinblastineTrp-Arg(8)-1 isomer conjugate possessed high selectivity against the mitotic spindles. HRMS and NMR data suggest that 17-desacetylvinblastineTrp-Arg(8)-1 and 17-desacetylvinblastineTrp-Arg(8)-2 are epimers at the tryptophan alpha carbon atom.","['Eotvos Lorand University, Budapest, Hungary.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The most common tumors diagnosed during pregnancy are breast and cervix cancer, Hodgkin lymphoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, leukemias, and malignant melanoma. The aim of therapy in pregnancy is to give optimal treatment to the mother without harm to the fetus. In the first trimester, organogenesis continues, so chemotherapy should not be given because of increasing risk of spontaneous abortion, fetal malformation, and mortality. We evaluated mostly seen tumors during pregnancy and assessed treatment type and outcome of pregnancy after chemotherapy in our population. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 27 patients who have been treated during pregnancy or after the delivery because of several malignancies. RESULTS: The tumors associated with pregnancy were breast cancer, hematologic malignancies,gynecologic malignancies, sarcomas, and others. The chemotherapy regimens were given in 17 of 27 patients in the second or third trimester of pregnancy. Four of the patients were diagnosed with cervical cancer, hemangiopericytoma, chronic myeloid leukemia,and breast cancer during the first trimester, so their pregnancies were ended by therapeutic abortion. Although 1 of the 3 fetuses who were exposed to chemotherapy in utero at the second or third trimester was born prematurely and low birth weight was diagnosed in the other 2 fetuses, fetal malformation was not seen in any of them. There were 7 normal and 9 cesarean deliveries. Twenty-three healthy babies survived from 27 pregnancies, of whom 17 babies were exposed to chemotherapeutic agents. CONCLUSIONS: We reported herein 27 patients with malignancies diagnosed during pregnancy; 17 patients received chemotherapy during the gestational period without any fetal or maternal abnormalities. Because of the low incidence of malignancy during pregnancy, our report is noteworthy.","['Department of Medical Oncology, Dr Lutfi KNrdar Kartal Education and Research Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey. basakoven@yahoo.com']",,,,,,,,,['Anatolian Medical Oncology Society Group'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVE: The main objective of the present study was to identify the cancer-related genes and gene pathways in the endometrium of healthy and cancer patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty endometrial tissues from healthy and type I EC patients were subjected to total RNA isolation. The RNA samples with good integrity number were hybridized to a new version of Affymetrix Human Genome GeneChip 1.0 ST array. We analyzed the results using the GeneSpring 9.0 GX and the Pathway Studio 6.1 software. For validation assay, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to analyze 4 selected genes in normal and EC tissue. RESULTS: Of the 28,869 genes profiled, we identified 621 differentially expressed genes (2-fold) in the normal tissue and the tumor. Among these genes, 146 were up-regulated and 476 were down-regulated in the tumor as compared with the normal tissue (P < 0.001). Up-regulated genes included the v-erb-a erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 3 (ErbB3), ErbB4, E74-like factor 3 (ELF3), and chemokine ligand 17 (CXCL17). The down-regulated genes included signal transducer and activator transcription 5B (STAT5b), transforming growth factor A receptor III (TGFA3), caveolin 1 (CAV1), and protein kinase C alpha (PKCA). The gene set enrichment analysis showed 10 significant gene sets with related genes (P < 0.05). The quantitative polymerase chain reaction of 4 selected genes using similar RNA confirmed the microarray results (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Identification of molecular pathways with their genes related to type I EC contribute to the understanding of pathophysiology of this cancer, probably leading to identifying potential biomarkers of the cancer.","['Department of Physiology, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Between January 2002 and June 2008, a total of 3024 cases with BM smears, imprints and sections conducted simultaneously were recruited. There were 1667 males and 1357 females with a median age of 55 years old (range: 7 to 92). The cellularity on imprint and smear was evaluated with the standard cellularity on BM section. With the integrative diagnosis (including all examinations and clinical outcomes) as the standard, the diagnostic accuracy of hematological diseases were compared between BM imprint, smear and section groups. Another 79 cases of lymphoma and 114 cases of plasma cell myeloma (PCM) were selected for a correlation analysis of tumor cell infiltration patterns. RESULTS: BM imprint contained hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic regions and cells retained integrated structure. The cellularity evaluation by imprint was superior to smear overall. In BM imprint group, the diagnostic accuracy for hypersplenism (n = 130), metastatic carcinoma (n = 67), refractory anemia with excess blasts, myeloproliferative neoplasm (n = 174), and PCM (n = 94) were better than smear group (96.9% vs 80.7%, 91.0% vs 76.1%, 92.6% vs 81.5%, 92.5% vs 76.4%, and 97.8% vs 92.6% respectively, all P < 0.05); And the diagnostic accuracy for megaloblastic anemia (n = 69), acute myeloid leukemia (n = 104), refractory cytopenia with unilineage dysplasia (n = 15), refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia (n = 22), and lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (n = 12) were higher than biopsy section group (100% vs 84.0%, 91.3% vs 74.0%, 86.7% vs 60.0%, 90. 9% vs 72.7%, and 66.6% vs 50.0% respectively, all P < 0.05); And the diagnostic accuracy for myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm (n = 26) was higher than smear group (76.3%, P < 0.05) and biopsy section group (78.2%, P < 0.05). Excellent correlations existed between BM imprint and section of the patients with lymphoma or with PCM (r = 0.90, r = 0.78, both P < 0.05).

Epub 2010 Oct 23.,"INTRODUCTION: Invasive fungal infections (IFI) remain a clinical concern in hematological patients with prolonged neutropenia because they are a major cause of morbidity and mortality. In a recent randomized trial, prophylaxis with posaconazole was associated with fewer IFI and related deaths relative to a fluconazole or itraconazole (Flu/Itra) control group (p < 0.001). In the current study, a cost effectiveness analysis was conducted to estimate the economic value of posaconazole as an alternative to Flu/Itra when used to prevent IFI in this patient population. METHODS: A decision analysis model was developed using clinical and economic data from randomized comparative trials, the economic literature, and from expert opinion. The data were then used to estimate the incremental cost per life year saved with oral posaconazole prophylaxis relative to Flu/Itra from the Canadian provincial health care system perspective. The base case results were then tested with a sensitivity analysis which evaluated extremes in the incidence of IFI as well as variations in their cost of management. RESULTS: Prophylaxis with posaconazole provides increased efficacy and an overall cost savings of approximately $Can4,259 per patient. Despite variations in the base case parameters, the sensitivity analysis suggested stability in the primary findings. Posaconazole was associated with an overall cost savings (range = $Can1,765 to $Can4,505) in all of the scenarios evaluated. Optimal cost effectiveness was obtained because the drug was able to avoid the more resource intensive Aspergillus infections. CONCLUSIONS: Prophylaxis with posaconazole in cancer patients with prolonged neutropenia is not only cost effective but also cost saving. The economic benefits were due to the drug's ability to reduce the incidence of high cost fungal infections, particularly Aspergillus species.","['Princess Margaret Hospital, Toronto, ON, Canada. gdranit@ca.inter.net']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2010 Oct 25.,"Hox genes encode DNA-binding proteins that are deployed in overlapping domains along various body axes during embryonic development. This sequential activation of Hox genes in temporal and spatial mode, the Hox code, is critical for the proper positioning of segmented structures along those axes, which include the vertebrate, limbs and, also digestive and reproductive tracts. It remains unknown how Hox genes are regulated to determine the identity of hematopoietic stem cells and their derivatives, which migrate and express most Hox genes. The key questions are whether the hematopoietic system has an axis, how epigenetic mechanisms restrict expression of Hox genes to specific cell types and what role Hox genes play in leukemic transformation? Taking in account these questions, we propose a combinatorial axial model of hematopoietic Hox code to predict the positional identity of the hematopoietic cells. This model will provide new insight into epigenetic therapy in leukemia.","['Institute for Marine Biosystem and Neurosciences, Department of Hydrobiology, College of Fisheries and Life Sciences, Shanghai Ocean University, Lingang New City, Shanghai, PR China.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2010 Oct 25.,"SUMOylation governs numerous cellular processes and is essential to most eukaryotic life. Despite increasing recognition of the importance of this process, an extremely limited number of small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) protein ligases (E3s) have been identified. Here we show that at least some members of the functionally diverse tripartite motif (TRIM) superfamily are SUMO E3s. These TRIM proteins bind both the SUMO-conjugating enzyme Ubc9 and substrates and strongly enhance transfer of SUMOs from Ubc9 to these substrates. Among the substrates of TRIM SUMO E3s are the tumor suppressor p53 and its principal antagonist Mdm2. The E3 activity depends on the TRIM motif, suggesting it to be the first widespread SUMO E3 motif. Given the large number of TRIM proteins, our results may greatly expand the identified SUMO E3s. Furthermore, TRIM E3 activity may be an important contributor to SUMOylation specificity and the versatile functions of TRIM proteins.","['Department of Cancer Biology and Abramson Family Cancer Research Institute, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA 19096, USA.']","['GM060911/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM060911-07/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM060911-06A2/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM060911/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA088868-09/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA088868/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA088868/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3103664,['NIHMS293187'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2010 Oct 25.,"The paired box domain of PAX5 was reported to fuse with the sequence of promyelocytic leukemia (PML) to produce PAX5-PML chimeric protein in two patients with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. In the present studies, we found, by gel shift assays, that PAX5-PML bound to a panel of PAX5-consensus sequence acts as a homodimer with reduction of its DNA-binding affinities in comparison with wild-type PAX5. In transient transfection assays using 293T and HeLa cells, and retrovirus transduction of murine hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells together with quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis, PAX5-PML inhibited wild-type PAX5 target gene transcriptional activity. Studies comparing PAX5-PML with PAX5-PML(DeltaCC) demonstrated that the coiled-coil (CC) protein interaction domain located within the PML moiety was required for PAX5-PML homodimer complex formation and partial transcriptional repression of genes controlled by PAX5. Fluorescent microscopic examination of transiently expressed YFP-tagged proteins in HeLa and 293T cells demonstrated that YFP-PAX5-PML and YFP-PAX5-PML(DeltaCC) exhibited a diffuse granular pattern within the nucleus, similar to PAX5 but not PML. By fluorescent recovery after photobleach (FRAP), we have shown that PAX5-PML fusion protein has reduced intranuclear mobility compared with wild-type PAX5. Furthermore, the dimerization domain (CC) of PML was responsible for the reduced intranuclear mobility of PAX5-PML.

Epub 2010 Oct 25.,"Myeloproliferation with prominent eosinophilia is associated with rearrangements of PDGFR-A or -B. The most common rearrangement is FIP1L1-PDGFRA (FP). The majority of patients with PDGFR-rearranged myeloproliferation respond to treatment with imatinib. In contrast to BCR-ABL-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia, only few cases of imatinib resistance and mutations of the FP kinase domain have been described so far. We hypothesized that the number of critical residues mediating imatinib resistance in FP in contrast to BCR-ABL might be limited. We performed an established systematic and comprehensive in vitro resistance screen to determine the pattern and frequency of possible TKI resistance mutations in FP. We identified 27 different FP kinase domain mutations including 25 novel variants, which attenuated response to imatinib, nilotinib or sorafenib. However, the majority of these exchanges did not confer complete inhibitor resistance. At clinically achievable drug concentrations, FP/T674I predominated with imatinib, whereas with nilotinib and sorafenib, FP/D842V and the compound mutation T674I+T874I became prevalent. Our results suggest that the PDGFR kinase domain contains a limited number of residues where exchanges critically interfere with binding of and inhibition by available PDGFR kinase inhibitors at achievable concentrations, which might explain the low frequency of imatinib resistance in this patient population. In addition, these findings would help to select the appropriate second-line drug in cases of imatinib-resistant disease and may be translated to other neoplasms driven by activated forms of PDGFR-A or -B.","['III.

However, the specific mechanisms of T cell transformation downstream of TLX1 remain to be elucidated. Here we show that transgenic expression of human TLX1 in mice induces T-ALL with frequent deletions and mutations in Bcl11b (encoding B cell leukemia/lymphoma-11B) and identify the presence of recurrent mutations and deletions in BCL11B in 16% of human T-ALLs. Most notably, mouse TLX1 tumors were typically aneuploid and showed a marked defect in the activation of the mitotic checkpoint. Mechanistically, TLX1 directly downregulates the expression of CHEK1 (encoding CHK1 checkpoint homolog) and additional mitotic control genes and induces loss of the mitotic checkpoint in nontransformed preleukemic thymocytes. These results identify a previously unrecognized mechanism contributing to chromosomal missegregation and aneuploidy active at the earliest stages of tumor development in the pathogenesis of cancer.","['Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA.']","['R01 CA120196-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA129382/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA120196/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA021765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA129382/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA120196/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24 CA114737/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA129382-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2974790,['NIHMS238550'],,,,,['Nat Med. 2010 Nov;16(11):1185-6.

Epub 2010 Oct 24.,"Protein kinase pathways play pivotal roles in cell signaling and biology. The phosphoproteome is a reflection of protein kinase pathway activation and therefore there is considerable interest in its quantification as a means to assess the wiring of signaling networks. Although different approaches for quantitative phosphoproteomics have been described, there is no data on how accurate these are for each quantified phosphorylated site. We report a liquid chromatography-MS approach to objectively assess data quality in high-content comparison of phosphoproteomes in which samples to be compared are mixed at different proportions. The experimental data is then used to derive a linear regression function that allows calculating correlation values, linearity, and accuracy. We applied the technique to investigate phosphorylation in P31/Fuj and Kasumi-1, two leukemia cells lines showing strikingly different sensitivities to scr and PI3K inhibitors. We found that phosphopeptides quantified with accuracy were not always quantified with precision because of low ion statistics contributing to variability. Thus our approach was complementary to standard methods for calculating the precision of replicate measurements based on the coefficient of variation and provided additional information on data quality for each quantified phosphopeptide. We quantified > 2250 phosphorylation sites across cell lines with different levels of sensitivity to kinase inhibitors, of which 1847 showed an accuracy variation of < 30% (with an overall mean of 22%). Hundreds of phosphorylation sites on proteins with diverse function (including kinases, transcription, and translation factors) showed significantly distinct intensities across sensitive and resistant cells lines, indicating that kinase pathways are differentially regulated in cancer cells of distinct sensitivity to signaling inhibitors.","[""Analytical Signalling Group, Centre for Cell Signalling, Institute of Cancer, Bart's and the London Medical School, Queen Mary University of London, UK.""]","['G0800914/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'BB_/Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council/United Kingdom']",PMC3013456,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2010 Oct 22.,"Homoharringtonine (HHT) is a plant alkaloid that inhibits the elongation phase of translation that is currently in clinical trials. Because the intrinsically short-lived antiapoptotic protein myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1) has been reported to support the survival of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells, we hypothesized that inhibition of protein synthesis by HHT would decrease Mcl-1 expression and induce apoptosis in CLL. In primary CLL cells, HHT induced significant apoptosis independent of the prognostic characteristics of the patients. This was associated with inhibition of translation and decreased Mcl-1 levels in CLL cells. Mcl-1 reduction was evident as early as 2 hours and continued to decrease in the next 6-8 hours, whereas cell death started in 2 hours and continued to increase for 24 hours. Reduction of the Mcl-1 level was due to translation inhibition and proteasome degradation rather than to transcription inhibition or caspase cleavage. HHT and the transcription inhibitor SNS-032 induced synergistic cell killing. Although stromal cells induced Mcl-1 expression and protected CLL cells from the toxicity of fludarabine, this induction was reversed by HHT, which overcame stromal cell-mediated protection. Thus, these results provide a rationale for clinical development of HHT in CLL as single agent or in combinations.","['Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas M D Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']","['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA100632/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA81534/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA081534/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA100632/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA16672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3037741,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2010 Oct 22.,"BACKGROUND: In 2009 the declaration by the World Health Organization of a global pandemic of influenza-H1N1 virus led to a vaccination campaign to ensure protection for immunocompromised patients. The goal of this study was to determine the efficacy of the 2009 H1N1 vaccine in patients with hematologic malignancies. DESIGN AND METHODS: We evaluated humoral and cellular immune responses to 2009 H1N1 vaccine in 97 adults with hematologic malignancies and compared these responses with those in 25 adult controls. Patients received two injections of vaccine 21 days apart and the controls received one dose. Antibody titers were measured using a hemagglutination-inhibition assay on days 0, 21 and 49 after injection of the first dose. Cellular immune responses to H1N1 were determined on days 0 and 49. RESULTS: By day 21 post-vaccination, protective antibody titers of 1:32 or more were seen in 100% of controls compared to 39% of patients with B-cell malignancies (P<0.001), 46% of allogeneic stem cell transplant recipients (P<0.001) and 85% of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (P=0.086). After a second dose, seroprotection rates increased to 68%, (P=0.008), 73%, (P=0.031), and 95% (P=0.5) in patients with B-cell malignancies, after allogeneic stem cell transplantation and with chronic myeloid leukemia, respectively. On the other hand, T-cell responses to H1N1 vaccine were not significantly different between patients and controls. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate the efficacy of H1N1 vaccine in most patients with hematologic malignancies and support the recommendation for the administration of two doses of vaccine in immunocompromised patients. These results may contribute towards the development of evidence-based guidelines for influenza vaccination in such patients in the future.","['Department of Haematology, Imperial College, Hammersmith Campus, 4th Floor Commonwealth Building, Du Cane Road, London W12 0NN, UK.']",,PMC3031700,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN AND METHODS: Patients with myelodysplastic syndrome and known bone marrow histology (n=721) who underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation were classified according to the degree of bone marrow fibrosis into those without fibrosis (n=483), those with mild or moderate fibrosis (n=199) and those with severe fibrosis (n=39) and analyzed regarding engraftment, treatment-related mortality, relapse and survival. RESULTS: The degree of fibrosis was not associated with disease status or abnormal cytogenetics. The cumulative incidence of engraftment achieved at day +30 in non-fibrotic patients was 93% and was significantly lower in those with mild or moderate fibrosis (89%) and severe fibrosis (75%) (P=0.009). Neutrophil engraftment occurred later in patients with mild or moderate fibrosis and severe fibrosis than in patients without fibrosis (median 17 versus 20 versus 16 days, respectively; P=0.002). The cumulative incidence of relapse at 3 years was significantly higher in patients with severe fibrosis than in those with a lesser degree of fibrosis or no fibrosis (47% versus 28% versus 27%, respectively; P=0.04), resulting in comparable 3-year disease-free survival rates in patients without fibrosis and in those with mild or moderate fibrosis (42% versus 38%, respectively) but a lower disease-free survival rate in those with severe fibrosis (18%; P=0.002). Severe fibrosis remained an independent factor for reduced survival (hazard ratio, 1.9; P=0.006).

Epub 2010 Oct 22.,"BACKGROUND: The prognosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in the elderly is poor. The GRAALL-SA1 phase II, randomized trial compared the efficacy and toxicity of pegylated liposomal doxorubicin versus continuous-infusion doxorubicin in patients 55 years or older with Philadelphia chromosome-negative acute lymphoblastic leukemia. DESIGN AND METHODS: Sixty patients received either continuous-infusion doxorubicin (12 mg/m(2)/day) and continuous-infusion vincristine (0.4 mg/day) on days 1-4 or pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (40 mg/m(2)) and standard vincristine (2 mg) on day 1, accompanied by dexamethasone, followed at day 28 by a second cycle, reinforced by cyclophosphamide. End-points were safety, outcome and prognostic factors. RESULTS: Myelosuppression was reduced in the pegylated liposomal doxorubicin arm with shorter severe neutropenia (P=0.05), shorter severe thrombocytopenia (P=0.03), and fewer red blood cell transfusions (P=0.04). Grade 3/4 infections and Gram-negative bacteremia were reduced in the pegylated liposomal doxorubicin arm (P=0.04 and P=0.02, respectively). There was a trend towards fewer cardiac events among the patients who received pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (1/29 versus 6/31). The complete remission rate was 82% and, with a median follow-up of 4 years, median event-free survival and overall survival were 9 and 10 months, respectively. Despite the better tolerance of pegylated liposomal doxorubicin, no differences in survival were observed between the two arms, due to trends towards more induction refractoriness (17 versus 3%, P=0.10) and a higher cumulative incidence of relapse (52% versus 32% at 2 years, P=0.20) in the pegylated liposomal doxorubicin arm. CONCLUSIONS: With the drug schedules used in this study, pegylated liposomal doxorubicin did not improve the outcome of elderly patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia despite reduced toxicities.","['Maladies du sang, CHU INSERM U892, 4 rue Larrey, 49000 Angers, France. mahunault@chu-angers.fr']",,PMC3031692,,,,['ClinicalTrials.gov/NCT00600977'],,,['Group for Research on Adult Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (GRAALL)'],"['Cailleres', 'Da Silva', 'Vaida', 'Royer', 'Dubus', 'Capiod', 'Marolleau', 'Francois', 'Hunault', 'Ifrah', 'Moles', 'Guardiola', 'Marie', 'Genevieve', 'Baranger', 'Chassevent', 'Blanchet', 'Boulat', 'Derre', 'Brion', 'Deconninck', 'Garnache', 'Larosa', 'Ottou', 'Ferrand', 'Leguay', 'Pigneux', 'Milpied', 'Perry', 'Lacombe', 'Tabrizi', 'Lippert', 'Guerin', 'Foucaud', 'Reman', 'Lepesant', 'Salaun', 'Plessis', 'Nguib', 'Leporrier', 'Audhuy', 'Raby', 'Bauly', 'Moskochenko', 'Garban', 'Bulabois', 'Gressin', 'Rolland', 'Jacob', 'Lefebvre', 'Leroux', 'Callanan', 'Cahn', 'Turlure', 'Bordessoule', 'Chaury', 'Trimoreau', 'Gachard', 'Le Nicolini', 'Tavernier', 'Thiebaut', 'Thomas', 'Lhertier', 'Girard', 'Wattel', 'Tigaud', 'Hayette', 'Michallet', 'Lafage-Pochitaloff', 'Fegueux', 'Quittet', 'Grosjean', 'Taib', 'Taviaux', 'Dupont', 'Rossi', 'Arkam', 'Ojeda', 'Uribe', 'Iglarz', 'Drenou', 'Jeandidier', 'Isaac', 'Witz', 'Ranta', 'Bologna', 'Lesesve', 'Witz', 'Gregoire', 'Bene', 'Chevallier', 'Delaunay', 'Moreau', 'Harousseau', 'Saulquin', 'Garand', 'Talmant', 'Avet-Loiseau', 'Gratecos', 'Legros', 'Sirvent', 'Touitou', 'Ticchioni', 'Raynaud', 'Legrand', 'Rio', 'Marjanovic', 'Vekhoff', 'Lacombe', 'Perot', 'Ramond', 'Viguie', 'Tang', 'Marie', 'Buzyn', 'Couderc', 'Asnafi', 'Valensi', 'Radford-Weiss', 'Macintyre', 'Varet', 'Dhedin', 'Aliammar', 'Merle-Beral', 'Nguyen-Khac', 'Davi', 'Leblond', 'Vernant', 'Raffoux', 'Treilhou', 'Maarek', 'Daniel', 'Soulier', 'Cayuela', 'Miclea', 'de Labarthe', 'Dombret', 'Himberlin', 'Baury', 'Daliphard', 'Luquet', 'Cornillet-Lefebvre', 'Delmer', 'Escoffre-Barbe', 'Lamy', 'Picouleau', 'Roussel', 'Henry', 'Ly Sunnaram', 'Fest', 'Bilger', 'Fohrer', 'Lioure', 'Ame', 'Eischen', 'Leymarie', 'Gervais', 'Herbrecht', 'Huguet', 'Recher', 'Daniel', 'Kuhlein', 'Dastugue', 'Damas', 'Delabesse', 'Attal', 'Choquet', 'Rousselot', 'Taksin', 'Pousset', 'Terre', 'Castaigne', 'Delannoy', 'Tacal', 'Rack']","['Cailleres', 'Da Silva', 'Vaida', 'Royer', 'Dubus', 'Capiod', 'Marolleau', 'Francois', 'Hunault', 'Ifrah', 'Moles', 'Guardiola', 'Marie', 'Genevieve', 'Baranger', 'Chassevent', 'Blanchet', 'Boulat', 'Derre', 'Brion', 'Deconninck', 'Garnache', 'Larosa', 'Ottou', 'Ferrand', 'Leguay', 'Pigneux', 'Milpied', 'Perry', 'Lacombe', 'Tabrizi', 'Lippert', 'Guerin', 'Foucaud', 'Reman', 'Lepesant', 'Salaun', 'Plessis', 'Nguib', 'Leporrier', 'Audhuy', 'Raby', 'Bauly', 'Moskochenko', 'Garban', 'Bulabois', 'Gressin', 'Rolland', 'Jacob', 'Lefebvre', 'Leroux', 'Callanan', 'Cahn', 'Turlure', 'Bordessoule', 'Chaury', 'Trimoreau', 'Gachard', 'Le Nicolini', 'Tavernier', 'Thiebaut', 'Thomas', 'Lhertier', 'Girard', 'Wattel', 'Tigaud', 'Hayette', 'Michallet', 'Lafage-Pochitaloff', 'Fegueux', 'Quittet', 'Grosjean', 'Taib', 'Taviaux', 'Dupont', 'Rossi', 'Arkam', 'Ojeda', 'Uribe', 'Iglarz', 'Drenou', 'Jeandidier', 'Isaac', 'Witz', 'Ranta', 'Bologna', 'Lesesve', 'Witz', 'Gregoire', 'Bene', 'Chevallier', 'Delaunay', 'Moreau', 'Harousseau', 'Saulquin', 'Garand', 'Talmant', 'Avet-Loiseau', 'Gratecos', 'Legros', 'Sirvent', 'Touitou', 'Ticchioni', 'Raynaud', 'Legrand', 'Rio', 'Marjanovic', 'Vekhoff', 'Lacombe', 'Perot', 'Ramond', 'Viguie', 'Tang', 'Marie', 'Buzyn', 'Couderc', 'Asnafi', 'Valensi', 'Radford-Weiss', 'Macintyre', 'Varet', 'Dhedin', 'Aliammar', 'Merle-Beral', 'Nguyen-Khac', 'Davi', 'Leblond', 'Vernant', 'Raffoux', 'Treilhou', 'Maarek', 'Daniel', 'Soulier', 'Cayuela', 'Miclea', 'de Labarthe', 'Dombret', 'Himberlin', 'Baury', 'Daliphard', 'Luquet', 'Cornillet-Lefebvre', 'Delmer', 'Escoffre-Barbe', 'Lamy', 'Picouleau', 'Roussel', 'Henry', 'Ly Sunnaram', 'Fest', 'Bilger', 'Fohrer', 'Lioure', 'Ame', 'Eischen', 'Leymarie', 'Gervais', 'Herbrecht', 'Huguet', 'Recher', 'Daniel', 'Kuhlein', 'Dastugue', 'Damas', 'Delabesse', 'Attal', 'Choquet', 'Rousselot', 'Taksin', 'Pousset', 'Terre', 'Castaigne', 'Delannoy', 'Tacal', 'Rack']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2010 Oct 22.,"BACKGROUND: Optimal lymphocyte parameters and thresholds for the diagnosis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia have been proposed by The National Cancer Institute sponsored Working Group and recently updated by the International Workshop on chronic lymphocytic leukemia. However, it is not clear how these criteria apply to patient management in daily clinical practice and whether the lymphocyte thresholds recommended truly predict clinical outcome in early chronic lymphocytic leukemia. DESIGN AND METHODS: For the purpose of this study, an observational database of the GIMEMA (Gruppo Italiano Malattie Ematologiche dell'Adulto) which included 1,158 patients with newly diagnosed Binet stage A chronic lymphocytic leukemia who were observed at different primary hematology centers during the period 1991-2000, was used. RESULTS: Among 818 consecutive chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients with Rai stage 0 (i.e. no palpable lymphadenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly) who had flow cytometry evaluations at the time of diagnosis and were included in a GIMEMA database, both absolute lymphocyte count and B-cell count were of a similar value in predicting time to first treatment as continuous variables (P<0.0001). Receiver operating characteristic analysis identified an absolute lymphocyte count of 11.5x10(9)/L and an absolute B-cell count of 10.0x10(9)/L as the best thresholds capable of identifying patients who will require treatment from those with stable disease. However, in a Cox's multivariate analysis only the B-cell count retained its discriminating power (P<0.0001) and the estimated rate of progression to chronic lymphocytic leukemia requiring treatment among subjects with a B-cell count less than 10.0x10(9)/L was approximately 2.3% per year (95% CI 2.1-2.5%) while it was 2-fold higher for patients with a B-cell count of 10.0x10(9)/L or over (i.e. 5.2% per year; 95% CI 4.9-5.5%). Finally, in this community-based patient cohort, the B-cell threshold defined by investigators at the Mayo Clinic (i.e. 11.0x10(9)/L) allowed patients to be divided into two subsets with a higher and lower likelihood of treatment (P<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Our results, based on a retrospective patients' cohort, provide a clear justification to retain the B-cell count as the reference gold standard of chronic lymphocytic leukemia diagnosis and imply that a count of 10x10(9)/L B cells is the best lymphocyte threshold to predict time to first treatment. The use of clinical outcome to distinguish chronic lymphocytic leukemia from other premalignant conditions, such as monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis, is a pragmatic approach meeting the patients' need to minimize the psychological discomfort of receiving a diagnosis of leukemia when the risk of adverse clinical consequences is low.","['Department Oncology-Hematology, Azienda Ospedaliera Pugliese-Ciaccio Viale Pio X, 88100 Catanzaro, Italy. smolica@libero.it']",,PMC3031696,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2010 Oct 22.,"BACKGROUND: Pediatric acute myeloid leukemia is a heterogeneous disease characterized by non-random genetic aberrations related to outcome. The genetic subtype is currently detected by different diagnostic procedures which differ in success rate and/or specificity. DESIGN AND METHODS: We examined the potential of gene expression profiles to classify pediatric acute myeloid leukemia. Gene expression microarray data of 237 children with acute myeloid leukemia were collected and a double-loop cross validation approach was used to generate a subtype-predictive gene expression profile in the discovery cohort (n=157) which was then tested for its true predictive value in the independent validation cohort (n=80). The classifier consisted of 75 probe sets, representing the top 15 discriminating probe sets for MLL-rearranged, t(8;21)(q22;q22), inv(16)(p13q22), t(15;17)(q21;q22) and t(7;12)(q36;p13)-positive acute myeloid leukemia. RESULTS: These cytogenetic subtypes represent approximately 40% of cases of pediatric acute myeloid leukemia and were predicted with 92% and 99% accuracy in the discovery and independent validation cohort, respectively. However, for NPM1, CEBPA, MLL(-PTD), FLT3(-ITD), KIT, PTPN11 and N/K-RAS gene expression signatures had limited predictive value. This may be caused by a limited frequency of these mutations and by underlying cytogenetics. This latter is exemplified by the fact that different gene expression signatures were discovered for FLT3-ITD in patients with normal cytogenetics and in those with t(15;17)(q21;q22)-positive acute myeloid leukemia, which pointed to HOXB-upregulation being specific for FLT3-ITD(+) cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, gene expression profiling correctly predicted the most prevalent cytogenetic subtypes of pediatric acute myeloid leukemia with high accuracy. In clinical practice, this gene expression signature may replace multiple diagnostic tests for approximately 40% of pediatric acute myeloid leukemia cases whereas only for the remaining cases (predicted as 'acute myeloid leukemia-other') are additional tests indicated. Moreover, the discriminative genes reveal new insights into the biology of acute myeloid leukemia subtypes that warrants follow-up as potential targets for new therapies.","[""Erasmus MC-Sophia Children's Hospital, Department of Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, Room Sp2456, PO Box 2060, 3000 CB Rotterdam, Netherlands.""]",,PMC3031689,,,,,,['Expert Rev Anticancer Ther. 2011 Mar;11(3):355-7.

Epub 2010 Oct 22.,"BACKGROUND: As rare myelomas, i.e. the IgD, IgE, IgM and non-secretory forms, constitute only a small proportion of any study, relatively little is known about their prognosis in the era of peripheral stem cell transplantation. DESIGN AND METHODS: We used the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation Myeloma Database to compare the outcome following autologous transplantation of over 20,000 patients with common myelomas (IgG, IgA and light chain myeloma) with the outcome of patients with rare myelomas: 379 IgD, 13 IgE, 72 IgM and 976 non-secretory cases. RESULTS: The study confirms the multiple adverse prognostic factors seen in IgD myeloma. Somewhat surprisingly, patients with IgD and non-secretory myeloma both had higher complete remission rates before and after transplantation than patients with common myelomas. However, while the overall survival of patients with non-secretory myeloma was similar to that of the patients with common myelomas, the survival of patients with IgD myeloma was significantly worse (although better than survival rates reported for non-transplanted patients); this was due to higher transplant-related mortality and relapse/progression rates. The post-transplantation survival of patients with IgE or IgM myeloma appears to be very poor. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides data on the biological features of rare myelomas. The overall survival of patients with IgD, IgE or IgM myeloma is poor following autologous transplantation but substantially better than that reported for patients who were not transplanted.","['Haematology Department, Belfast City Hospital, Lisburn Road, Belfast BT9 7AD, UK. curlymorris_cliff@yahoo.com']",['MC_G0802523/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom'],PMC2995572,,,,,,,['Myeloma Subcommittee of Chronic Leukaemia Working Party of EBMT'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2010 Oct 22.,"BACKGROUND: Epidemiological data on myeloid malignancies are very rare in the literature due to a lack of registration by cancer registries until 2000. The Registry of Hematologic Malignancies of the Cote d'Or Department in France has, however, steadfastly registered data on cases occurring in the Department since 1980, resulting, to date, in a database of over 5,000 cases classified according to the ICD-O-3 classification, following the most recent World Health Organization classification criteria. DESIGN AND METHODS: Twenty-five years of data on myeloid malignancies, including acute myeloid leukemia, myeloproliferative neoplasms, myelodysplastic syndromes and myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative syndromes were analyzed. World population standardized incidence rates were calculated as were as observed and relative survival. RESULTS: Incidence rates per 100,000 inhabitants/year were 2.5 for acute myeloid leukemia, 1.3 for myelodysplastic syndromes, 3.2 for myeloproliferative neoplasms and 0.6 for myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative syndromes. It was found that the incidence rate of myelodysplastic syndromes increased significantly over the period. The median overall survival is 8.9 months for patients with acute myeloid leukemia, 33.8 months for patients with myelodysplastic syndromes, 91.7 months for those with myeloproliferative neoplasms and 26.6 months for patients with myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative syndromes. Observed and relative 20-year survival rates are, respectively, 12% and 13% in acute myeloid leukemia, 2% and 6% in myelodysplastic syndromes and 20% and 34% in myeloproliferative neoplasms. CONCLUSIONS: These population-based data on myeloid malignancies are the first data collected over such a long period and provide interesting information for clinicians and public health authorities, particularly given the paucity of other long-term, population-based data from cancer registries.","[""Registre des Hemopathies Malignes de Cote d'Or, EA 4184, Faculte de Medecine, Dijon Cedex, France.

Epub 2010 Oct 22.,"BACKGROUND: Despite the excellent responses to imatinib therapy observed in patients with chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia, approximately 25% of patients display primary resistance or suboptimal response. The OCT-1 activity in mononuclear cells reflects the efficiency of active influx of imatinib. OCT-1 activity in mononuclear cells is highly variable between patients and significantly correlates with a patient's molecular response to imatinib treatment and overall survival. The present study examined whether cell lineage and BCR-ABL expression influenced OCT-1 activity. DESIGN AND METHODS: The OCT-1 activity and OCT-1 mRNA expression was assessed in pure populations of neutrophils, monocytes and lymphocytes recovered from chronic myeloid leukemia patients at diagnosis, in cytogenetic remission and normal individuals. The role of BCR-ABL on OCT-1 activity and differentiation was examined in a cell line model of ectopic BCR-ABL expression. RESULTS: The OCT-1 activity and OCT-1 mRNA expression was highest in the neutrophil population and lowest in lymphocytes (P<0.05). This was observed for patients at diagnosis, in cytogenetic remission and normal individuals. Interestingly, neutrophil OCT-1 activity was not significantly different between patients at diagnosis, in remission and normal donors. This was also observed for monocytes and lymphocytes. Furthermore, OCT-1 activity in mononuclear cells was significantly correlated with the OCT-1 activity in neutrophils (P=0.001). In a cell line model in which BCR-ABL was ectopically expressed, we found no evidence that BCR-ABL directly affected OCT-1 expression and function. However, BCR-ABL stimulated granulocyte differentiation which, in turn, led to significantly increased OCT-1 activity (P=0.024). CONCLUSIONS: These studies suggest that the predictive OCT-1 activity in patient mononuclear cells is strongly related to cell lineage, particularly the presence of neutrophils in the peripheral blood. Furthermore, BCR-ABL expression is unlikely to directly influence OCT-1 activity but may have an indirect role by enhancing granulocyte differentiation.","['Department of Haematology, SA Pathology (RAH Campus), Frome Road, Adelaide.

Epub 2010 Oct 22.,"Autologous transplantation of peripheral blood (PB) hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) is a widely used strategy for reconstitution of blood cells following high-dose chemotherapy for hematologic malignancies such as multiple myeloma (MM), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), among others. Stem cells for transplantation are usually obtained from PB after treatment with chemotherapy with or without cytokine, usually granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), or after treatment with cytokine alone. The use of autologous peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs) for transplantation is associated with the risk of contamination of the graft with tumor cells; whether this impacts response rates, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) is still debatable. This review summarizes the controversy surrounding tumor cell mobilization (TCM), the complexity of detection of minimal residual diseases, the available diagnostic tools, differences in TCM with available mobilization regimens, and the potential effect of TCM on clinical outcome. Collectively, these data suggest that new treatment paradigms to manage hematologic malignancies, such as MM, NHL, and AML, are needed and should focus on increasing the chemosensitivity of the tumor and eliminating residual disease.","['Division of Oncology, Siteman Cancer Center, Washington, University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri 63101, USA. jdipersi@im.wustl.edu']",,,,,['2011.

Among various oligolysine-based lipid derivatives differing in lysine residue number and lipid moiety, trilysinoyl oleylamide (TLO)-based liposomes (TLOL) showed the highest delivery efficiency combined with minimal cytotoxicity. Delivery of siRNA using TLOL silenced target genes both in vitro and in vivo. In green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing tumor tissue, a significant reduction of fluorescence was observed after intratumoral administration of siGFP using TLOL compared with control siGL2. Intravenous administration of siMcl1 employing pegylated TLOL (pTLOL) reduced the expression of human Mcl1 protein in KB-xenografted tumor tissue. Despite the reduction in target protein Mcl1 expression following such systemic delivery, tumor growth was only slightly reduced compared to a siGL2-treated control group. To potentiate the anticancer activity of siMcl1, the anticancer drug suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) was additionally encapsulated in pTLOL. After intravenous administration of siMcl1 using SAHA-loaded pTLOL (pSTLOL), a significant reduction in tumor growth was observed compared to that seen in animals treated with free SAHA or siGL2 complexed with pSTLOL. The results indicate that pTLOL could be further developed as a systemic delivery system for synergistic anticancer siRNA and a drug.","['School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Korea University, Anam-dong, Seungbuk-gu, Seoul, South Korea.']",,,,,['Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Given the large number of genes recorded in microarray experiments, gene expression data are generally displayed on a low dimensional plot, based on linear methods. However, microarray data show nonlinearity, due to high-order terms of interaction between genes, so alternative approaches, such as kernel methods, may be more appropriate. We introduce a technique that combines kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) and Biplot to visualize gene expression profiles. Our approach relies on the singular value decomposition of the input matrix and incorporates an additional step that involves KPCA. The main properties of our method are the extraction of nonlinear features and the preservation of the input variables (genes) in the output display. We apply this algorithm to colon tumor, leukemia and lymphoma datasets.

METHODS: To investigate its relevance in the context of a stem cell transplant (SCT), we examined its influence in chronic myeloid leukaemia, a disease with well-established prognostic factors. Data were collected on 626 patients who received a first myeloablative allogeneic SCT between 1981 and 2006. Star sign was determined for each patient. RESULTS: Univariate analyses comparing all 12 individual star signs showed considerable variation of 5-year probabilities of survival, 63% for Arians, to 45% for Aquarians, but without significance (P=.65). However, it was possible to pool together star signs likely to provide dichotomous results. Thus, grouping together Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Leo, Scorpio, and Capricorn (group A; n=317) versus others (group B; n=309) resulted in a highly significant difference (58% vs 48%; P=.007). When adjusted for known prognostic factors in a multivariate analysis, group B was associated with an increased risk of mortality when compared with group A (relative risk [RR], 1.37; P=.005). CONCLUSION: In this study, we show that, providing adequate care is taken, a significant relationship between patient star sign and survival post SCT for CML can be observed. This is, however, a completely erroneous result, and is based on the pooling together of observations to artificially create a statistically significant result. Statistical analyses should thus be carried out on a priori hypotheses and not to find a meaningful or significant result.","['Department of Medicine, Centre for Haematology, Imperial College/Hammersmith Hospital, London, UK. rszydio@imperial.ac.uk']",,,,,['Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Thus, WT1 may constitute a target for therapies such as those mediated by adoptive-specific T lymphocytes. Serological and cellular immune responses have been elicited by WT1 in patients with leukemia. Specific CD8+ T cells able to recognize this antigen can be selected by streptamers and then infused into leukemia patients. Potentially, these T cells could lyse leukemic blasts expressing WT1. The only good manufacturing practice-certified technology is streptamers, which are available for antigen-specific T-cell sorting. Immunocompromised patients may have their antigen-specific immune responses restored through the transfer of adoptive T cells specific for this LAA.","['Department of Internal Medicine III, University Clinic Rostock, Rostock, Germany.']",,,,,['Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Antigen-targeted immunotherapies represent novel treatments for CLL patients. Earlier, we screened the mRNA expression of several tumor associated antigens (TAAs), observing the presence of RHAMM/CD168, fibromodulin, syntaxin, and NY-Ren60 in 55%-90% of CLL patients. RHAMM/CD168, fibromodulin, PRAME, and MPP11 were expressed in CLL patients but not in healthy volunteers. Quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction revealed higher RHAMM expression in high-risk CLL patients as well as in advanced stages of the disease. CLL cases with higher RHAMM expressions showed significantly shorter median treatment-free survivals. Among patients with mutated IgVH genes, an analysis of RHAMM expression enabled us to distinguish a subgroup of patients with a favorable prognosis. In lymph nodes, RHAMM staining correlated with a higher Ki-67 index and CD40L expression. Functionally, stimulation with CD40L enhanced RHAMM expression in CLL. Because of the exquisite tissue expression of RHAMM and its high expression frequency in CLL patients, we further characterized RHAMM-specific CD8+ T cells in these patients. CD8+ T cells primed with the RHAMM-derived epitope R3, which is restricted by human leukocyte antigen (HLA)A2, lysed RHAMM+ CLL cells. Therefore, we initiated a Phase I clinical trial of R3 peptide vaccination. Four patients exhibited reduced white blood cell counts during the vaccination process. In 5/6 patients, R3-specific CD8+ T cells were detected with the corresponding peptide/HLA-A2 tetrameric complex; these populations were verified functionally in 4/5 patients using ELISpot assays. In conclusion, RHAMM expression seems to be of prognostic value, and may reflect the proliferative capacity of CLL cells; it may therefore represent an interesting target for immunotherapy. Peptide vaccination in CLL patients was safe eliciting specific CD8+ T-cell responses against the tumor antigen RHAMM.","['Clinical Immunology Department, Medical University of Lublin, Lublin, Poland.']",,,,,['Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

At present, it is not a usual condition for lung transplant (LT), accounting for <1% of all indications in the international registry. We sought, to describe the clinical features and outcomes of patients undergoing LT for BO after ABMT in our group. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We undertook a cross-sectional study of patients with an indication for LT due to BO after ABMT from the beginning of our program. We recorded the type of transplant, patient age, clinical course, functional outcome, and survival. RESULTS: Among 313 LT, 13 cases (4.2%) were due to BO, including 3 after ABMT (0.96%). ABMT was indicated after bone marrow aplasia in 2 cases and acute myeloid leukemia in the other patient. The patients were 2 men (both 35 years old) and 1 woman, aged 25 years. All subjects received double elective LT at 24, 20, and 9 years post ABMT. At the time of LT, all displayed severe obstructive ventilatory defects with a forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1)<30% and partial respiratory insufficiency. The initial immunosuppression was cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil, and steroids in all cases. Two of the subjects required changes in the immunosuppressive regimen: 1 due to chronic graft rejection with subsequent functional recovery and the other due to hematologic and neurologic toxicity. After 96, 37, and 9 months, all the patients were alive with baseline dyspnea of functional class 0 and a FEV1 of about 68%. CONCLUSION: LT is an effective therapy in terms of lung function and survival for patients with respiratory failure secondary to the development of BO after ABMT.","['Department of Pneumology, Lung Transplant Unit, Reina Sofia University Hospital, Cordoba, Spain. javierredel@msn.com']",,,,,['Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2010 Oct 20.,"AIM OF THE STUDY: Non-response (NR) to treatment of childhood relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) is an end-point of protocol therapy. Subsequent management has not yet been standardised. This study analyses different approaches after NR to aid optimising future strategies. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Ninety-three children with NR to treatment according to ALL relapse-protocols of the Berlin/Frankfurt/Muenster (BFM) Study Group (03/1990-2006/1999) were retrospectively assigned to a curative (C: intensive polychemotherapies, stem cell transplantation (SCT); n=51), palliative (P: 1-2 antineoplastic agents; n=23) or supportive (S: no antineoplastic therapy; n=19) treatment approach. RESULTS: Median survival after diagnosis of NR were 121 (C), 89 (P) and 42 (S) days, respectively (p<0.001). In cohort C, a complete remission (2ndCR) was obtained in 16/51 patients, among these 13 only after SCT, and nine children achieved partial remission. Ten of the 51 patients died from treatment-related complications, 39/51 from disease progression. Today, two patients are still in continuous CR after SCT. Adverse prognostic factors were overrepresented in the non-curative cohorts. Time-point of relapse and treatment after NR were independent predictors of survival duration. Most patients without antineoplastic treatment died at home, the majority of the others in the hospital. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment after NR has been heterogeneous and customised. Therapies with curative intent are capable of inducing 2ndCR but associated with high treatment-related morbidity, -mortality and minimal survival. NR patients may, therefore, be ideal candidates for controlled phase I/II trials, thus offering them a chance to benefit from new drugs and promoting drug development for cohorts with better prognosis.","['Department of Paediatric Oncology/Hematology, Charite Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany. arend.stackelberg@charite.de']",,,,,['Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Epub 2010 Oct 20.,"Loss of function mutations in CCAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha (CEBPA) have been identified in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and bi-allelic (double) CEBPA mutations are associated with improved prognosis in cases of cytogenetically normal-AML. In a subset of AML patients lacking CEBPA mutations, core promotor methylation of CEBPA has been described and is associated with a gene expression profile similar to the mutated cases including the expression of T cell associated genes such as CD7. However, the overall incidence and pattern of CEBPA mutations and core promoter methylation has not been thoroughly explored in a larger subset of AML with expression of CD7. Here we describe a simple and clinically deployable CEBPA promoter methylation test and the results of combined testing for CEBPA mutations and promoter methylation in 102 cases of AML, including 43 CD7+ cases. Overall, there were 5 methylated cases, 6 cases with double mutations, and 3 cases with single mutations. Significantly, 10 of 43 CD7+ cases (23%) had either methylated or double-mutated CEBPA. The CD7+ subset included all 5 methylated cases and 5 of the 6 cases with double mutations. All 3 cases with single mutations were CD7-. No case exhibited both hypermethylation and mutations. We find that promoter methylation accounts for half of those CD7+ cases with CEBPA dysregulating abnormalities. Furthermore, methylated cases and those with bi-allelic CEBPA mutations have similar phenotypic features including expression of CD7 and lack of co-incident NPM1 mutations. Our study suggests that methylation testing may be as important as mutation testing for identifying AML cases with CEBPA dysregulation and may be indicated in the routine prognostic workup of AML.","['ARUP Institute for Clinical and Experimental Pathology, ARUP Laboratories, Salt Lake City, UT, USA.']",['5R21DE017136/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States'],,,,['Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

It is largely unknown how the leukemic blasts proliferate and differentiate in fetal tissues. We report the histopathological findings of an autopsy case of a stillbirth with transient abnormal myelopoiesis. Blood vessels in almost all organs were filled with immature leukemic cells, most of which expressed megakaryocyte antigen CD42b. In contrast, leukemic cells infiltrating the tissues, including the pericardium, expressed myeloperoxidase. These findings indicate that leukemic progenitors in transient abnormal myelopoiesis can differentiate along both megakaryocytic and myeloid lineages, which may be influenced by microenvironmental factors.

Some patients may have a related donor with whom they are mismatched at 1 antigen/allele. It is not known whether such a match is preferable to a matched unrelated donor (MUD). We evaluated the outcomes (survival, relapse, nonrelapse mortality [NRM]) of all 28 patients with a single HLA antigen/allele mismatch identified through high-resolution HLA typing at HLA-A, -B, -C, -DRB1, and -DQB1, and all 318 patients with myeloid malignancies who received transplants from a 10/10 MUD treated during the same period of time at a single institution. Overall, outcomes for patients treated from a 1-antigen/allele mismatch related donor were significantly worse than from a MUD, primarily because of increased NRM. Overall survival (OS) rates at 3 years for 1-antigen/allele mismatched related donor and MUD transplant recipients were 19% and 45% (P = .007), and NRM rates were 40% and 26% (P = .05), respectively. Patients with class I mismatches appeared to have poorer OS than did patients with class II mismatches. A higher incidence of graft rejection was identified in the mismatched related donor group (P = .02). These results indicate that transplant outcomes are better with a MUD than with a 1 antigen/allele-mismatched related donor.","['Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC4112359,['NIHMS601820'],,"['Copyright (c) 2011 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

These oncogenic functions of Stat5 have been elegantly reproduced in mouse models. Aberrant Stat5 activity induces also mitochondrial dysfunction and reactive oxygen species leading to DNA damage. Although DNA damage can stimulate tumorigenesis, it can also prevent it. Stat5 can inhibit tumor progression like in the liver and it is a tumor suppressor in fibroblasts. Stat5 proteins are able to regulate cell differentiation and senescence activating the tumor suppressors SOCS1, p53 and PML. Understanding the context dependent regulation of tumorigenesis through Stat5 function will be central to understand proliferation, survival, differentiation or senescence of cancer cells.","['Departement de Biochimie, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec H3C 3J7, Canada. g.ferbeyre@umontreal.ca']",,,,,['Copyright A(c) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

NMR studies of the KIX-L628A mutant suggest that L628 plays a crucial role in conformational transitions at the MLL binding site, necessary for high affinity interactions with MLL.

Ethical standards also must be high so that participation is voluntary and informed. However, this can be difficult to achieve in trials with complex designs and in those which are closely embedded in clinical practice. Optimal recruitment requires a balance of both ethical and accrual considerations. In the context of a trial of stratified treatments for children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (UKALL2003) we examined how recruitment looked to an observer and how it felt to the parents, to identify how doctors' communication could promote or inhibit optimal recruitment. METHODS: We audio-recorded, transcribed and analysed routine doctor-patient consultations (n = 20) and interviews between researchers and parents (n = 30 parents) across six UK treatment centres. Analysis was informed by the constant comparative method. For consultation transcripts, analysis focussed on how doctors presented the trial. We compared this with analysis of the interview transcripts which focussed on parents' perceptions and understanding of the trial. RESULTS: Parents and doctors discussed the trial in most consultations, even those that did not involve a decision about randomisation. Doctors used language allying them both with the trial and with the parent, indicating that they were both an 'investigator' and a 'clinician'. They presented the trial both as an empirical study with a scientific imperative and also as offering personalisation of treatment for the child. Parents appeared to understand that trial involvement was voluntary, that it was different from routine care and that they could withdraw from the trial at any time. Some were confused about the significance of the MRD test and the personalisation of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Doctors communicated in ways that generally promoted optimal recruitment, indicating that trials can be embedded into clinical practice. However, parents were unclear about some details of the trial's rationale, suggesting that recruitment to trials with complicated designs, such as those involving stratified treatments, might need enhanced explanation.","['University of Manchester, Education & Research Centre, University Hospital of South Manchester, Southmoor Road, Manchester M23 9LT, UK. lucie.byrne-davis@manchester.ac.uk']","['G0800792/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'C19412/A6913/CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom']",PMC2972295,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition to serving as a model for normal cell differentiation, disturbances in this process results in immunodeficiencies and malignancies, such as leukemia and lymphoma, making the subject of high relevance for modern medicine. Although the process of B lymphopoiesis has been under intense investigation, recent methodological developments within the area of cell sorting, genome-wide expression, and DNA-binding analysis has allowed for a rapid development of the understanding of B-lymphocyte differentiation. This has suggested that the path to B-lymphoid cell fate may be initiated by lineage priming reflected in the expression of lymphoid associated genes already in multipotent hematopoietic progenitors. Upon differentiation, the gene expression profile is changed to involve an increasing number of B-lineage-restricted genes linked to loss of alternative developmental potentials and B-lineage commitment. This review focuses on the molecular regulation of early B-lymphoid development and aims to provide an up to date summary of the current status of the research area.","['Experimental Hematopoiesis Unit, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Faculty of Health Sciences, Linkoping University, Linkoping, Sweden.']",,,,,['(c) 2010 John Wiley & Sons A/S.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization (arrayCGH) in 49 intermediate-risk AML and RT-PCR-based screening in 532 AML cases allowed the detection of ins(21;8)/ins(8;21) in three cases; arrayCGH and subsequent RT-PCR revealed an approximately 0.5 Mb sized inserted fragment generating the 5'RUNX1/3'RUNX1T1 fusion gene in one case with a submicroscopic ins(21;8)(q22;q22q22) whereas the other two cases were identified by banding analysis and RT-PCR, respectively.

Deregulated Notch signalling has been implicated in many diseases, but the clearest example of a pathogenic role is found in T-cell lymphoblastic leukaemia/lymphoma (T-LL), in which the majority of human and murine tumours have acquired mutations that lead to aberrant increases in Notch1 signalling. Remarkably, it appears that the selective pressure for Notch mutations is virtually unique among cancers to T-LL, presumably reflecting a special context-dependent role for Notch in normal T-cell progenitors. Nevertheless, there are some recent reports suggesting that Notch signalling has subtle, yet important roles in other forms of haematological malignancy as well. Here, we review the role of Notch signalling in various blood cancers, focusing on T-LL with an eye towards targeted therapeutics.","[""Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA 02115, USA. jaster@rics.bwh.harvard.edu""]","['P01CA 119070/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA092433/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA092433/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA119070-01A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI047833/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA119070-050001/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA119070-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01AI047833/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA119070/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2996483,['NIHMS239630'],,"['Copyright (c) 2010 Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.

A variety of methods to uncover insertion sites have been described. This chapter details SplinkTA-PCR and SplinkBlunt-PCR, modified from splinkerette-PCR, for mapping chromosomally the insertion sites of a murine leukemia virus that causes leukemia in the BXH-2 strain of mice.

We compared the cost and effectiveness of RIST with those of stem cell transplantation using a conventional myeloablative regimen (CST). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty consecutive patients who underwent transplantation for myeloid malignancy were included. Life years and medical costs during the entire treatment course for up to 2 years after transplantation were evaluated, and cost-effectiveness was assessed from the payer's perspective. MAIN RESULTS: Of these 50 cases, 35 were treated with CST and 15 were treated with RIST. The mean survival time was 1.5 years in CST and 1.2 years in RIST, while the mean total cost per patient within the first 2 years was $29,630 for CST and $29,466 for RIST, with no significant difference. The duration of total hospitalization was shorter in RIST than in CST; then, the cost for hospitalization represented a lower proportion of the total cost in RIST (49% of total cost) than in CST (63%). In contrast, the cost related to the conditioning regimen was significantly higher in RIST than in CST. CONCLUSIONS: This result suggests that the increased cost of the conditioning regimen offsets the reduced cost of hospitalization in RIST. Although some differences were observed in the details of the cost, the total cost and mean survival were comparable between CST and RIST, and this result was confirmed by a probabilistic sensitivity analysis.","['Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Kagawa University, 1750-1 Ikenobe, Miki-cho, Kita-gun, Kagawa, 761-0793, Japan. oima@med.kagawa-u.ac.jp']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Dysregulation of BCL6 and PRDM1 has been associated with lymphomagenesis. Here, we show for the first time that direct cell-cell contact between follicular dendritic cells (FDC) and B-lymphocytes, by influencing the expression of a set of microRNAs (miRNAs), regulates the expression of BCL6 and PRDM1. We identify that, on cell adhesion to FDC, FDC induces upregulation of PRDM1 expression through downregulation of miR-9 and let-7 families and induces downregulation of BCL-6 through upregulation of miR-30 family in B-lymphocytes and lymphoma cells. We further demonstrate that the miR-30 family directly controls BCL-6 expression and miR-9-1 and let-7a directly control PRDM-1 expression through targeting their 3'UTR, mediating the FDC effect. Our studies define a novel regulatory mechanism in which the FDC, through induction of miRNAs in B-lymphocytes, orchestrates the regulation of transcription factors, promotes germinal center B-cell survival and differentiation. Dysregulation of miRNAs may interfere with B-cell survival and maturation, thus representing a novel molecular mechanism, as well as a potential therapeutic target in B-cell lymphomas.","['Department of Malignant Hematology, H Lee Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL 33613, USA.']","['R01 CA114504-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA114504/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA077859/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA137123/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA076292/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA137123/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA137123-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3083119,['NIHMS286008'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A handful of compounds are currently in clinical development in primary myelofibrosis or post-polycythemia vera (PV)/essential thrombocythemia (ET) myelofibrosis. To date, clinical benefit has been demonstrated in terms of reduction of splenomegaly, improvement in constitutional symptoms, and control of leukocytosis. Some of the drugs have also been evaluated in PV and ET, with demonstrated activity against erythrocytosis, thrombocytosis, pruritus, and splenomegaly. However, drug effect on bone marrow fibrosis or JAK2 allele burden has been modest so far. Regardless, it is important to keep in mind that current anti-JAK2 treatment trials constitute only the beginning of many upcoming similar clinical trials, and that it is premature to make generalizations or any form of comparative conclusions regarding drug activity or toxicity.","['Leukemia Program, Harvard Medical School, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02115, USA.

In order to corroborate that the biological activity for selenium compounds depends on the chemical form, a broad structural variety is presented. These structures include selenocyanates, diselenides, selenoalkyl functional moieties and eight newly synthesized symmetrically substituted dithioselenites and selenylureas. Eleven of the derivatives tested showed high levels of superoxide generation in vitro via oxidation of reduced glutathione (GSH) and nine of them were more catalytic than the reference compound, diselenodipropionic acid. Eighteen of the library compounds inhibited cell growth more than or similar to reference chemotherapeutic drugs in PC-3 and eleven were more potent cytotoxic agents than etoposide in the MCF-7 cell line. Considering both parameters (superoxide generation and cell cytotoxicity) compounds B1, C6 and C9 displayed the best therapeutic profiles. Considering that many diselenide compounds can generate superoxide (O(2)(-)) in vitro via oxidation of GSH and other thiols, the analogue B1, that contains a diselenide moiety, was selected for a preliminary mechanistic investigation, which revealed that B1 has apoptogenic effects similar to camptothecin mediated by reactive oxygen species (ROS) in lymphocytic leukemia cells (CCRF-CEM) and affected the MCF-7 cell-cycle in G(2)/M and S-phases.","['Department of Organic and Pharmaceutical Chemistry, University of Navarra, Irunlarrea, 1, E-31008 Pamplona, Spain.']",,PMC6259179,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

About 50% of patients with AML have no cytogenetic aberrations, presenting normal karyotype, and are categorized in the intermediate risk group. In this group detection of FLT3 mutations move a patient from the intermediate to the adverse risk group. MATERIAL/METHODS: Bone marrow from 80 AML patients was cultured to obtain chromosome slides and then karyotype. Simultaneously DNA was isolated from bone marrow and PCR reaction was conducted to test the FLT3 mutation status (ITD and D835). For statistical analysis Chi squared test was used. RESULTS: From the group of 80 AML patients seven were classified as a favorable risk group and FLT3/ITD was found only in one of these patients (14.28%), and FLT3/D835 in another one (14.28%). Fifteen patients showed a complex karyotype with more than three aberrations or with any aberration known as a poor prognosis. Among the adverse group FLT3/ITD was detected in three patients (20%) and D835 mutation in two other patients (13.33%). Among 58 patients with normal karyotype in GTG banding FLT3/ITD occurred in six cases (10.34%) and D835 mutation in two cases (3.45%). No significant difference was found among these three risk groups regarding presence or absence of FLT3/ITD and FLT/D835. DISCUSSION: Molecular characterization of mutations in several genes, such as FLT3, NPM1, MLL, CEBPA, in acute myeloid leukemia, especially in normal karyotype cases, could be another factor after cytogenetic analysis to stratify AML patients into different prognostic categories.","['Department of Medical Diagnostics, Medical University, Poznan. ewamaly@gmail.com']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has been shown that the infusion of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor-mobilized donor peripheral blood stem cells (G-PBSCs) can enhance graft-versus-leukemia effects and speed hematopoietic recovery. Fifty-eight AML patients aged 60-88 years were randomly assigned to receive induction chemotherapy with cytarabine and mitoxantrone (control group; n = 28) or it plus human leukocyte antigen-mismatched G-PBSCs (G-PBSC group; n = 30). Patients who achieved complete remission received another 2 cycles of postremission therapy with intermediate-dose cytarabine or it plus G-PBSCs. The complete remission rate was significantly higher in the G-PBSC group than in the control group (80.0% vs 42.8%; P = .006). The median recovery times of neutrophils and platelets were 11 days and 14.5 days, respectively, in the G-PBSC group and 16 days and 20 days, respectively, in the control group after chemotherapy. The 2-year probability of disease-free survival was significantly higher in the G-PBSC group than in the control group (38.9% vs 10.0%; P = .01). No graft-versus-host disease was observed in any patient. Persistent donor microchimerism was successfully detected in all of the 4 female patients. These results indicate that G-PBSCs in combination with conventional chemotherapy may provide a promising treatment method for AML in elderly patients.","['Department of Hematology and Transplantation, Affiliated Hospital of Academy of Military Medical Sciences, Beijing, China.']",,,,,,,,['Blood. 2011 Jan 20;117(3):746-8.

Epub 2010 Oct 21.,"Last year marked 30 years of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation as a curative treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Initially studies used stem cells from identical twins but techniques rapidly developed to use cells first from HLA-identical siblings and later unrelated donors. During the 1990s CML became the most frequent indication for allogeneic transplantation worldwide. This, together with the relative biologic homogeneity of CML in chronic phase, its responsiveness to graft-versus-leukemia effect and the ability to monitor low level residual disease placed CML at the forefront of research into different strategies of stem cell transplantation. The introduction of BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase inhibitors during the last decade resulted in long-term disease control in the majority of patients with CML. In those who fail to respond and/or develop intolerance to these agents, transplantation remains an effective therapeutic solution. The combination of tyrosine kinase inhibitors with transplantation is an exciting new strategy and it provides inspiration for similar approaches in other malignancies.","['Department of Haematology, Imperial College at Hammersmith Hospital, London, UK. jiri.pavlu@imperial.nhs.uk']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SUMMARY: Recent advances in the treatment of CLL have dramatically changed the therapeutic landscape for both patients and health care professionals. The majority of conventional first-line therapies are noncurative and are only used to treat disease that is symptomatic or progressive and include chlorambucil, monotherapy with purine analogues, and combination chemotherapy. Immunotherapeutic agents such as rituximab and alemtuzumab may be indicated in select patient populations. However, because clinical trials have found that overall survival does not depend on the initial therapy, selection of first-line therapy should be based on patient-specific factors and the patient's goals for therapy with respect to response, survival, and symptom palliation. Progression-free survival time and time to treatment are critical endpoints for CLL treatment. An increasingly important endpoint is minimal residual disease (MRD), as it is considered to be the major cause of relapse in CLL. Finally, comparison of toxicities between different therapies is critical in CLL, as it is in other disease states. Several new agents are currently being evaluated for use in CLL, including alvocidib, oblimersen, and lumiliximab. CONCLUSION: Chemotherapy remains the mainstay of treatment for the majority of patients with CLL. The introduction of rituximab, alemtuzumab, and bendamustine has improved the current outlook for patients with CLL. As overall survival does not appear to depend on the initial therapy, treatment should be selected based on patient-specific factors and goals. Challenges in CLL include determining when to initiate therapy, eradicating MRD, and managing therapeutic resistance.","['Oncology Pharmacy Residency, Johns Hopkins Hospital, 600 North Wolfe Street/Carnegie 180, Baltimore, MD 21287, USA. ahatfie2@jhmi.edu']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2010 Oct 21.,"Several recent articles have reported the presence of a gammaretrovirus, termed ""XMRV"" (xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus) in prostate cancers (PCa). If confirmed, this could have enormous implications for the detection, prevention, and treatment of PCa. However, other articles report failure to detect XMRV in PCa. We tested nearly 800 PCa samples, using a combination of real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry (IHC). The PCR reactions were simultaneously monitored for amplification of a single-copy human gene, to confirm the quality of the sample DNA and its suitability for PCR. Controls showed that the PCR assay could detect the XMRV in a single infected cell, even in the presence of a 10,000-fold excess of uninfected human cells. The IHC used 2 rabbit polyclonal antisera, each prepared against a purified murine leukemia virus (MLV) protein. Both antisera always stained XMRV-infected or -transfected cells, but never stained control cells. No evidence for XMRV in PCa was obtained in these experiments. We discuss possible explanations for the discrepancies in the results from different laboratories. It is possible that XMRV is not actually circulating in the human population; even if it is, the data do not seem to support a causal role for this virus in PCa.","['HIV Drug Resistance Program, National Cancer Institute, Frederick, MD 21702, USA.']","['P50 CA058236/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'ZIA BC011325-01/Intramural NIH HHS/United States', 'P50CA58236/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3005136,['NIHMS247617'],,['(c)2010 AACR.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2010 Oct 21.,"Some murine-endogenous retroviruses, making up approximately 10 % of the mouse genome, are induced during the course of experimental sepsis in which lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a pathogenic component of gram-negative bacteria, often plays a critical role. In this study, we investigated whether LPS stress induces the production of murine leukemia virus type-endogenous retrovirus (MuLV-ERV) virions in primary lymphoid cells. LPS treatment of cells (single-cell suspensions and sorted B- and T-cells) isolated from seven lymphoid organs of C57BL/6J mice resulted in a differential increase in the production of MuLV-ERV virions in most cells examined. Interestingly, among the 34 unique MuLV-ERV U3 sequences cloned from the viral genomic RNAs, the nuclear respiratory factor 1 (transcription factor) element was present only in the 20 U3 sequences that were derived from the LPS-induced MuLV-ERV U3 bands. Using the U3 sequences as a probe, 55 putative MuLV-ERV loci were mapped onto the C57BL/6J mouse genome and 15 of them retained full coding potential. Furthermore, one full-length recombinant MuLV-ERV originating from a locus on chromosome 13 was determined to be responsive to LPS stress. The findings from this study suggest that LPS stress differentially activates MuLV-ERV virion production in lymphoid organs in a cell type- and MuLV-ERV-specific manner. Further investigation is needed to define the role of MuLV-ERVs in the LPS signalling pathway(s) in general, as well as in the pathogenesis of sepsis.","['Burn Research, Shriners Hospitals for Children Northern California and Department of Surgery, University of California, Davis, Sacramento, CA 95817, USA.']",['R01 GM071360/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],PMC3081078,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2010 Oct 19.,"BACKGROUND: Imatinib treatment significantly improves survival in patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML), but little is known about whether treatment can safely be discontinued in the long term. We aimed to assess whether imatinib can be discontinued without occurrence of molecular relapse in patients in complete molecular remission (CMR) while on imatinib. METHODS: In our prospective, multicentre, non-randomised Stop Imatinib (STIM) study, imatinib treatment (of >2 years duration) was discontinued in patients with CML who were aged 18 years and older and in CMR (>5-log reduction in BCR-ABL and ABL levels and undetectable transcripts on quantitative RT-PCR). Patients who had undergone immunomodulatory treatment (apart from interferon alpha), treatment for other malignancies, or allogeneic haemopoietic stem-cell transplantation were not included. Patients were enrolled at 19 participating institutions in France. In this interim analysis, rate of relapse was assessed by use of RT-PCR for patients with at least 12 months of follow-up. Imatinib was reintroduced in patients who had molecular relapse. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00478985. FINDINGS: 100 patients were enrolled between July 9, 2007, and Dec 17, 2009. Median follow-up was 17 months (range 1-30), and 69 patients had at least 12 months follow-up (median 24 months, range 13-30). 42 (61%) of these 69 patients relapsed (40 before 6 months, one patient at month 7, and one at month 19). At 12 months, the probability of persistent CMR for these 69 patients was 41% (95% CI 29-52). All patients who relapsed responded to reintroduction of imatinib: 16 of the 42 patients who relapsed showed decreases in their BCR-ABL levels, and 26 achieved CMR that was sustained after imatinib rechallenge. INTERPRETATION: Imatinib can be safely discontinued in patients with a CMR of at least 2 years duration. Imatinib discontinuation in this setting yields promising results for molecular relapse-free survival, raising the possibility that, at least in some patients, CML might be cured with tyrosine kinase inhibitors.","[""Laboratoire d'Hematologie et Service des Maladies du Sang, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France. francois-xavier.mahon@umr5540.u-bordeaux2.fr""]",,,,,['Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Epub 2010 Oct 1.,"The present study demonstrates photoinduced generation of superoxide radical anion and singlet oxygen upon UVA irradiation of ethyl 1,4-dihydro-8-nitro-4-oxoquinoline-3-carboxylate (DNQC), and its cytotoxic/phototoxic effects on murine leukemia L1210 cells. The formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was investigated by EPR spectroscopy using in situ spin trapping technique and 4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-piperidine (TMP) for singlet oxygen ((1)O(2)) detection. The EPR spectra monitored upon photoexcitation of aerated solutions of DNQC in dimethylsulfoxide evidenced the efficient activation of molecular oxygen via Types I and II mechanisms. The cytotoxic/phototoxic effects of DNQC, analysis of cell cycle, induction of apoptosis/necrosis, DNA damage and molecular mechanism of apoptotic death of L1210 cells in dark and in the presence of UVA irradiation were compared. DNQC induced a different cytotoxic/phototoxic effect, which was concentration- and time-dependent. The four highest tested concentrations of non-photoactivated and photoactivated DNQC induced immediate cytotoxic/phototoxic effect after 24h cultivation of L1210 cells. This effect decreased with the time of treatment. The irradiation increased the sensitivity of leukemia cell line on DNQC, but the cell sensitivity decreased with time of processing.

Epub 2010 Oct 20.,"T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is an aggressive hematologic tumor resulting from the malignant transformation of immature T-cell progenitors. Originally associated with a dismal prognosis, the outcome of T-ALL patients has improved remarkably over the last two decades as a result of the introduction of intensified chemotherapy protocols. However, these treatments are associated with significant acute and long-term toxicities, and the treatment of patients presenting with primary resistant disease or those relapsing after a transient response remains challenging. T-ALL is a genetically heterogeneous disease in which numerous chromosomal and genetic alterations cooperate to promote the aberrant proliferation and survival of leukemic lymphoblasts. However, the identification of activating mutations in the NOTCH1 gene in over 50% of T-ALL cases has come to define aberrant NOTCH signaling as a central player in this disease. Therefore, the NOTCH pathway represents an important potential therapeutic target. In this review, we will update our current understanding of the molecular basis of T-ALL, with a particular focus on the role of the NOTCH1 oncogene and the development of anti-NOTCH1 targeted therapies for the treatment of this disease.","['Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University, NY, USA.']","['R01 CA120196/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA120196-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA129382/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA129382-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3033461,['NIHMS242181'],,['Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Epub 2010 Oct 22.,"IMPORTANCE OF THE FIELD: Cytarabine is a polar nucleoside drug used for the treatment of myeloid leukemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The drug has a short plasma half-life, low stability and limited bioavailability. Overdosing of patients with continuous infusions may lead to side effects. Thus, various prodrug strategies and delivery systems have been explored extensively to enhance the half-life, stability and delivery of cytarabine. Among the recent cytarabine prodrugs, amino acid conjugate ValCytarabine and fatty acid derivative CP-4055 (in Phase III trials) have been investigated for the treatment of leukemia and solid tumors, respectively. Alternatively, delivery systems of cytarabine have emerged for the treatment of different cancers. The liposomal-cytarabine formulation (DepoCyt(R), Pacira Pharmaceuticals Inc., New Jersey, USA) has been approved for the treatment of lymphomatous meningitis. AREAS COVERED IN THIS REVIEW: Various prodrug strategies evaluated for cytarabine are discussed. Then, the review summarizes the drug delivery systems that have been used for more effective cancer therapy. WHAT THE READER WILL GAIN: This review provides in-depth discussion of the prodrug strategy and delivery systems of cytarabine derivatives for the treatment of cancer. The design of cytarabine prodrugs and delivery systems provides insights for designing the next generation of more effective anticancer agents with enhanced delivery and stability. TAKE HOME MESSAGE: Strategies on designing cytarabine prodrug and delivery formulations showed great promise in developing effective anticancer agents with better therapeutic profile. Similar studies with other anticancer nucleosides can be an alternative approach to gaining access to more effective anticancer agents.","['University of Rhode Island, College of Pharmacy, Department of Biomedical and Pharmaceutical Sciences, 41 Lower College Road, Kingston, RI 02881, USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast, sporadic CEBPA-associated AML is defined as AML in which a CEBPA pathogenic variant(s) is identified in leukemic cells but not in the non-leukemic cells. In the majority of individuals, the age of onset of familial AML appears to be earlier than sporadic AML; disease onset has been reported in persons as young as age 1.8 years and up to age 50 years. The prognosis of CEBPA-associated familial AML appears to be favorable compared with sporadic CEBPA-associated AML. Individuals with CEBPA-associated familial AML who have been cured of their initial disease may be at greater risk of developing additional independent leukemic episodes, in addition to the risk of relapse from preexisting clones. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis of CEBPA-associated familial AML is established by identification of a heterozygous germline CEBPA pathogenic variant in a specimen that contains only non-leukemic cells from an individual and/or family with AML. MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: Treatment usually includes cytarabine/anthracycline-based induction and cytarabine-based consolidation chemotherapy. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) from a volunteer unrelated donor or appropriately screened family member should be reserved for individuals failing to achieve remission following standard induction therapy or for disease recurrence. Whenever possible, persons with AML should be treated as part of a clinical trial protocol. Surveillance: Similar to that for other forms of AML; because of the increased risk of late leukemia recurrence in persons with familial AML, lifelong surveillance is recommended. Asymptomatic individuals should have a CBC every six to 12 months and bone marrow examination for CBC abnormalities. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Use of sib or related donors for HSCT without prior assessment of the germline CEBPA pathogenic variant in the donor. GENETIC COUNSELING: Predisposition to CEBPA-associated familial AML is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Most individuals diagnosed with CEBPA-associated familial AML have had an affected parent who shares the germline pathogenic variant. Germline CEBPA pathogenic variants exhibit complete or near-complete penetrance for the development of AML in families reported to date. Each child of an affected individual has a 50% chance of inheriting the germline pathogenic variant. Prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk is possible if the germline CEBPA pathogenic variant in the family is known.",,['HHSN276201400262U/NLM NIH HHS/United States'],,,,"['Copyright (c) 1993-2022, University of Washington, Seattle.

We report a chronic-phase CML patient undergoing IM treatment, who showed the overt existence of the T315I mutation after 15 months. We retrospectively analyzed the distribution of the T315I mutation using the invader assay and direct DNA sequencing among FACSAria-sorted populations from bone marrow cells: total mononuclear cells (TMC), hematopoietic stem cells (HSC)/Thy-1(+), HSC/Thy-1(-), common myeloid progenitors (CMP), granulocyte macrophage progenitors (GMP), and megakaryocyte erythroid progenitors (MEP), at 0, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after IM treatment.

Epub 2010 Oct 21.,"Bufalin, a naturally occurring small-molecule compound from Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) Chansu showed inhibitory effects against human prostate, hepatocellular, endometrial and ovarian cancer cells, and leukemia cells. However, whether or not bufalin has inhibitory activity against the proliferation of human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells is unclear. The aim of this study is to study the effects of bufalin on the proliferation of NSCLC and its molecular mechanisms of action. The cancer cell proliferation was measured by MTT assay. The apoptosis and cell cycle distribution were analyzed by flow cytometry. The protein expressions and phosphorylation in the cancer cells were detected by Western blot analysis. In the present study, we have demonstrated that bufalin suppressed the proliferation of human NSCLC A549 cell line in time- and dose-dependent manners. Bufalin induced the apoptosis and cell cycle arrest by affecting the protein expressions of Bcl-2/Bax, cytochrome c, caspase-3, PARP, p53, p21WAF1, cyclinD1, and COX-2 in A549 cells. In addition, bufalin reduced the protein levels of receptor expressions and/or phosphorylation of VEGFR1, VEGFR2, EGFR and/or c-Met in A549 cells. Furthermore, bufalin inhibited the protein expressions and phosphorylation of Akt, NF-kappaB, p44/42 MAPK (ERK1/2) and p38 MAPK in A549 cells. Our results suggest that bufalin inhibits the human lung cancer cell proliferation via VEGFR1/VEGFR2/EGFR/c-Met-Akt/p44/42/p38-NF-kappaB signaling pathways; bufalin may have a wide therapeutic and/or adjuvant therapeutic application in the treatment of human NSCLC.","['Laboratory of Molecular Pharmacology, School of Pharmacy, Yantai University, No. 30, Qing Quan Lu, Lai Shan Qu, 264005, Yantai, Shandong Province, China.']",,PMC2995143,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To test safety and immunogenicity of a vaccine composed of WT1-, Pr3-, and MUC1-derived Class I-restricted peptides and the pan HLA-DR T helper cell epitope (PADRE) or MUC1-helper epitopes in combination with CpG7909 and MontanideISA51, four patients with AML and five with MM were repetitively vaccinated. No clinical responses were observed. Neither pre-existing nor naive WT1-/Pr3-/MUC1-specific CD8+ T cells expanded in vivo by vaccination. In contrast, a significant decline in vaccine-specific CD8+ T cells was observed. An increase in PADRE-specific CD4+ T helper cells was observed after vaccination but these appeared unable to produce IL2, and CD4+ T cells with a regulatory phenotype increased. Taken into considerations that multiple clinical trials with identical antigens but different adjuvants induced vaccine-specific T cell responses, our data caution that a vaccination with leukemia-associated antigens can be detrimental when combined with MontanideISA51 and CpG7909. Reflecting the time-consuming efforts of clinical trials and the fact that 1/3 of ongoing peptide vaccination trails use CpG and/or Montanide, our data need to be taken into consideration.","['Department of Hematology, University Medical Center Utrecht, Lundlaan 6, Utrecht, The Netherlands. j.h.e.kuball@umcutrecht.nl']","['CA33084/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA18029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA018029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA033084/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA033084-29/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA018029-36/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA033084/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3024516,['NIHMS260351'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The results were obtained when the biotinylated-reverse primer bound to streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and hydrolysed the substrate. This novel readout system was approximately 1000-fold more sensitive than the conventional agarose gel electrophoresis.

Epub 2010 Oct 21.,"After more than 1500 gene therapy clinical trials in the past two decades, the overall conclusion is that for gene therapy (GT) to be successful, the vector systems must still be improved in terms of delivery, expression and safety. The recent development of more efficient and stable vector systems has created great expectations for the future of GT. Impressive results were obtained in three primary immunodeficiencies and other inherited diseases such as congenital blindness, adrenoleukodystrophy or junctional epidermolysis bullosa. However, the development of leukemia in five children included in the GT clinical trials for X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency and the silencing of the therapeutic gene in the chronic granulomatous disease clearly showed the importance of improving safety and efficiency. In this review, we focus on the main strategies available to achieve physiological or tissue-specific expression of therapeutic transgenes and discuss the importance of controlling transgene expression to improve safety. We propose that tissue-specific and/or physiological viral vectors offer the best balance between efficiency and safety and will be the tools of choice for future clinical trials in GT of inherited diseases.","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Temple University School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA, USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to investigate the incidence and characteristics of treatment-related myelodysplasia and acute myeloid leukemia (t-MDS/AML) after treatment with fludarabine in combination for lymphoproliferative disorders and identify risk factors for its development. In all, 176 patients treated with fludarabine combination were followed for a median of 41 months (range 6-125 months). In all, 19 cases of t-MDS/AML have been identified for an overall rate of 10.8%. Median overall survival post-t-MDS/AML diagnosis was 11 months. Patients developing t-MDS/AML included 11/54 with follicular lymphoma (FL) (crude rate 20.4%), 5/82 with CLL (6.1%) and 3/24 with Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia or marginal zone lymphoma (12.5%). Most patients had other cytotoxic treatments (median 4, range 0-7) but three with FL had fludarabine combination as their only line of treatment. Of the eleven patients (6.3%) who received mitoxantrone with their first fludarabine combination, four (36.4%) developed t-MDS/AML (P=0.007). There was a trend toward prior cytotoxic therapy increasing the risk for t-MDS/AML (P=0.067). Fludarabine combination chemotherapy is associated with a moderate risk of t-MDS/AML particularly when combined with mitoxantrone. This complication should be considered when evaluating the potential benefit of this treatment in lymphoproliferative disorders.","['Department of Haematology and Medical Oncology, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, St Andrews Place, East Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. dennis.carney@petermac.org']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2010 Oct 4.,"Nanog is a stem cell transcription factor required for self-renewal and for maintaining pluripotency, and Nanog itself is regulated at least in part by leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF)--a pluripotent cytokine of the IL6 family. MARCH-7 is an E-3 ligase linked to regulation of the LIF-receptor in T lymphocytes and T cells from mice that lack expression of MARCH-7 are hyper-responsive to activation signals and show a five-fold increase in LIF activity. Here we ask, does MARCH-7 influence the expression profile of Nanog during the synchronized entry of T cells into the cell cycle? We discovered that lack of MARCH-7 was permissive for Nanog expression at both transcript and protein levels during G(1)/S: moreover, addition of exogenous LIF to the MARCH-7 null cells caused a further 13-fold induction of Nanog; other measured transcripts including TGFbeta, p53 and STAT3 were relatively unchanged. Since lack of MARCH-7 altered responsiveness to activation signals we sought evidence for pre-existing regulatory miR's that might correlate with MARCH-7 gene dose using head-to-head comparisons between MARCH-7 null, heterozygous and wt spleen cells. 34 miRs were found including miR-346 that is known to target LIF transcripts and miR-346 is one of 16 miRs differentially expressed between hESCs and induced hiPSCs. Of the 34 miRs, 12 were known to be temporally regulated in embryonic nerve cells. In summary, in the absence of MARCH-7 a new signaling pathway is unmasked that involves Nanog expression in the T cell lineage. This is the first demonstration that T cells retain responsiveness to a LIF/Nanog axis and that this axis is linked to MARCH-7.","['Department of Surgery, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.']","['P01CA56036/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01CA76259/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01CA81534/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3055204,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2010 Oct 20.,"Cytogenetic alterations, such as amplifications, deletions, or translocations, contribute to myeloid malignancies. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as critical regulators of hematopoiesis, and their aberrant expression has been associated with leukemia. Genomic regions containing sequence alterations and fragile sites in cancers are enriched with miRNAs; however, the relevant miRNAs within these regions have not been evaluated on a global basis. Here, we investigated miRNAs relevant to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) by (1) mapping miRNAs within leukemia-associated genomic alterations in human AML cell lines by high-resolution genome arrays and (2) evaluating absolute expression of these miRNAs by massively parallel small RNA sequencing. Seventy-seven percent (542 of 706) of miRNAs mapped to leukemia-associated copy-number alterations in the cell lines; however, only 18% (99 of 542) of these miRNAs are expressed above background levels. As evidence that this subset of miRNAs is relevant to leukemia, we show that loss of 2 miRNAs identified in our analysis, miR-145 and miR-146a, results in leukemia in a mouse model. Small RNA sequencing identified 28 putative novel miRNAs, 18 of which map to leukemia-associated copy-number alterations. This detailed genomic and small RNA analysis points to a subset of miRNAs that may play a role in myeloid malignancies.","['British Columbia Cancer Agency Research Centre, Vancouver, BC, Canada.']",['MOP 89 976/Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Defective Rho regulation causes nervous system dysfunctions including mental retardation and Alzheimer's disease. Rac1, a member of the Rho family, regulates dendritic spines and excitatory synapses, but relatively little is known about how synaptic Rac1 is negatively regulated. Breakpoint cluster region (BCR) is a Rac GTPase-activating protein known to form a fusion protein with the c-Abl tyrosine kinase in Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia. Despite the fact that BCR mRNAs are abundantly expressed in the brain, the neural functions of BCR protein have remained obscure. We report here that BCR and its close relative active BCR-related (ABR) localize at excitatory synapses and directly interact with PSD-95, an abundant postsynaptic scaffolding protein. Mice deficient for BCR or ABR show enhanced basal Rac1 activity but only a small increase in spine density. Importantly, mice lacking BCR or ABR exhibit a marked decrease in the maintenance, but not induction, of long-term potentiation, and show impaired spatial and object recognition memory. These results suggest that BCR and ABR have novel roles in the regulation of synaptic Rac1 signaling, synaptic plasticity, and learning and memory, and that excessive Rac1 activity negatively affects synaptic and cognitive functions.","['National Creative Research Initiative Center for Synaptogenesis and Department of Biological Sciences, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon 305-701, Korea.']","['R01 HL071945/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL071945/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'BB/G003963/1/Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council/United', 'Kingdom', 'P01 HL060231/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL060231/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC5076888,['NIHMS821077'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2010 Oct 20.,"Vaccinia virus (VacV) enters mammalian cells, replicates extranuclearly, and produces virions that move to the cell surface along microtubules, fuse with the plasma membrane, and move from infected cells toward apposing cells on actin-filled membranous protrusions or actin tails. To form actin tails, cell-associated enveloped virions (CEV) require Abl and Src family tyrosine kinases. Furthermore, release of CEV from the cell requires Abl but not Src family tyrosine kinases and is blocked by imatinib mesylate (STI-571; Gleevec), an Abl family kinase inhibitor used to treat chronic myelogenous leukemia in humans. Here we demonstrate that the Poxviridae family members monkeypox virus (MPX) and variola virus (VarV) use conserved mechanisms for actin motility and extracellular enveloped virion (EEV) release. Furthermore, we show that imatinib mesylate is effective in a mouse model of infection with VacV, whether delivered prophylactically or postinfection, and restricts spread of virions from the site of inoculation. While inhibitors of both Src and Abl family kinases, such as dasatinib (BMS-354825; Sprycel), are effective in limiting dissemination of VacV, VarV, and MPX in vitro, members of this class of drugs appear to have immunosuppressive effects in vivo that preclude their use as anti-infectives. Together, these data suggest a possible utility for imatinib mesylate in treating smallpox or MPX infections or complications associated with vaccination.","['Microbiology and Molecular Genetics Graduate Program, Emory University School of Medicine, 615 Michael Street, Whitehead Research Building 155, Atlanta, Georgia 30322, USA.']",,PMC3014172,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2010 Oct 20.,"Chromosomal translocations targeting the mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) gene result in MLL fusion proteins that are found in aggressive human acute leukemias. Disruption of MLL by such translocations leads to overexpression of Hox genes, resulting in a blockage of hematopoietic differentiation that ultimately leads to leukemia. Menin, which directly binds MLL, has been identified as an essential oncogenic co-factor required for the leukemogenic activity of MLL fusion proteins. Here, we characterize the molecular basis of the MLL-menin interaction. Using (13)C-detected NMR experiments, we have mapped the residues within the intrinsically unstructured fragment of MLL that are required for binding to menin. Interestingly, we found that MLL interacts with menin with a nanomolar affinity (K(d) approximately 10 nM) through two motifs, MBM1 and MBM2 (menin binding motifs 1 and 2). These motifs are located within the N-terminal 43-amino acid fragment of MLL, and the MBM1 represents a high affinity binding motif. Using alanine scanning mutagenesis of MBM1, we found that the hydrophobic residues Phe(9), Pro(10), and Pro(13) are most critical for binding. Furthermore, based on exchange-transferred nuclear Overhauser effect measurements, we established that MBM1 binds to menin in an extended conformation. In a series of competition experiments we showed that a peptide corresponding to MBM1 efficiently dissociates the menin-MLL complex. Altogether, our work establishes the molecular basis of the menin interaction with MLL and MLL fusion proteins and provides the necessary foundation for development of small molecule inhibitors targeting this interaction in leukemias with MLL translocations.","['Department of Pathology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109, USA. jolantag@umich.edu']",,PMC3003368,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Amino acids were connected to the tetracycle through linkers with lengths of n=2 and 3 atoms using ester (series I), amide (series II), and secondary amine (series III) functions. DNA binding was evaluated by thermal denaturation and fluorescence measurements. Lysine and arginine substituted derivatives with n=3 provided the highest DNA binding. Arginine derivative 32 (n=2, series II) and glycine derivative 34 (n=2, series III) displayed high topoisomerase II inhibition. Incrementing the length of the N-6 side chain from two to three methylene units provided a significant increase in DNA affinity but a substantial loss in topoisomerase II inhibition. The most cytotoxic compounds toward HL60 leukemia cells were 19, 33, and 34 displaying micromolar IC(50) values. When tested with the topoisomerase II-mutated HL60/MX2 cell line, little variation of IC(50) values was found, suggesting that topoisomerase II might not be the main target of these compounds and that additional targets could be involved.","[""EA CMF 4478, Universite Lille Nord de France-Universite Lille 1, Bat C3(2), Cite Scientifique, 59655 Villeneuve d'Ascq Cedex, France.""]",,,,,['Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Our goal was to evaluate if protein fractions from cacao seeds show antitumor activity on lymphoma murine L5178Y model. The antioxidant activity of these fractions was also evaluated with the aim of finding a correlation with the antitumor activity. METHODS: Differential extraction of proteins from unfermented and semi-fermented-dry cacao seeds was performed and characterized by SDS-PAGE and FPLC size-exclusion chromatography. Antitumor activity was evaluated against murine lymphoma L5178Y in BALB/c mice (6 x 104 cells i.p.), with a treatment oral dose of 25 mg/kg/day of each protein fraction, over a period of 15 days. Antioxidant activity was evaluated by the ABTS+ and ORAC-FL assays. RESULTS: Albumin, globulin and glutelin fractions from both cacao seed type were obtained by differential solubility extraction. Glutelins were the predominant fraction. In the albumin fraction, polypeptides of 42.3 and 8.5 kDa were found in native conditions, presumably in the form of two peptide chains of 21.5 kDa each one. The globulin fraction presented polypeptides of 86 and 57 kDa in unfermented cacao seed that produced the specific-cacao aroma precursors, and after fermentation the polypeptides were of 45 and 39 kDa. The glutelin fraction presented proteins >200 kDa and globulins components <100 KDa in lesser proportion. Regarding the semifermented-dry cacao seed, it was observed that the albumin fraction showed antitumoral activity, since it caused significant decreases (p < 0.05) in the ascetic fluid volume and packed cell volume, inhibiting cell growth in 59.98 +/- 13.6% at 60% of the population; while the greatest antioxidant capacity due to free radical scavenging capacity was showed by the albumin and glutelin fraction in both methods assayed. CONCLUSION: This study is the first report on the biological activity of semifermented-dry cacao protein fractions with their identification, supporting the traditional use of the plant.

Epub 2010 Oct 19.,"Before the advent of tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy, the evaluation of hematologic and cytogenetic responses was sufficient to gauge treatment efficacy in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia. However, with more potent TKI therapies, the majority of patients achieve complete cytogenetic response. Furthermore, deeper molecular responses are now commonly achieved, necessitating a reliance on molecular monitoring to assess residual leukemic disease. The prognostic significance between molecular responses and duration of complete cytogenetic response, progression-free survival, and event-free survival is described herein. A discussion of the concept of complete molecular response is also provided, and the potential for imatinib treatment discontinuation is evaluated.

Epub 2010 Oct 19.,"BACKGROUND: Higher-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are similar pathobiologically to acute myeloid leukemia (AML), particularly in older adults. AML therapies thus may have activity in MDS. In the current study, phase 2 study data of arsenic trioxide (ATO) and gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO) in CD33-positive patients with MDS and secondary AML (sAML) were presented. METHODS: Between June 2004 and February 2006, 30 patients with higher-risk MDS or sAML received ATO (at a dose of 0.25 mg/kg intravenously for 5 days during Week 1, then twice weekly during Weeks 2-12) and GO (at a dose of 3 mg/m(2) on Day 8) for 1 or 2 cycles of 12 weeks each. The primary endpoint was response as per MDS or AML International Working Group (IWG) criteria. Adverse events were collected throughout treatment. Patients were followed for a minimum of 3 years for survival. RESULTS: The median patient age was 69 years. A total of 18 patients had MDS, 12 had sAML, and 19 had been previously treated. Seventeen patients (57%) completed >/=1 cycle, and 7 patients (23%) completed 2 cycles. IWG responses occurred in 9 patients (30%) according to IWG MDS criteria (including 2 of 7 patients who failed hypomethylating agents) and 3 of 12 AML patients (25%) according to IWG AML criteria. Grade 3/4 (according to National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria [version 3.0]) thrombocytopenia occurred in 47% of patients, neutropenia in 63%, and anemia in 37% of patients. The median overall survival was 9.7 months (28.6 months in responders and 7.6 months in nonresponders; P <.001). Patients who completed 2 cycles of therapy spent a median of 13 days in the hospital. CONCLUSIONS: Combination therapy with ATO and GO was found to have acceptable response rates and toxicity, and may be a viable treatment option to standard induction therapy, particularly for patients who fail therapy with hypomethylating agents.","['Leukemia Program, Department of Hematologic Oncology and Blood Disorders, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio 44195, USA. sekerem@ccf.org']",['U54RR19397-03/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States'],,,,['Copyright (c) 2010 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Induction consisted of idarubicin 12 mg/m(2) a day on days 1-3, cytarabine 1.5 g/m(2) intravenously continuously daily on days 1-4 (days 1-3 if age >/=60 years), and tipifarnib, with the first cohort (n = 6) receiving 200 mg orally twice a day and all others receiving 300 mg twice a day for 21 days every 28 days. Consolidation consisted of 5 courses of idarubicin 8 mg/m(2) a day on days 1-2, cytarabine 0.75 g/m(2) a day on days 1-3, and tipifarnib 300 mg twice a day for 14 days every 4-6 weeks. Maintenance with tipifarnib 300 mg twice a day for 21 days every 4-6 weeks was continued for 6 months. RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 33 months, 61 patients achieved complete remission (CR) (64%), and 9 achieved complete remission with incomplete platelet recovery (CRp) (9%). The median duration of CR was not reached. Median overall survival was 17 months. The most common grade 3 adverse events were gastrointestinal toxicities, liver dysfunction, and skin rash. Compared with historical IA, IA and tipifarnib showed a better CR duration (P = .04) and a trend toward a higher CR rate in patients with chromosome 5/7 abnormalities. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of IA and tipifarnib is safe and active.

Erythropoietic-stimulating agents have been used for treatment of imatinib-induced anemia. There are no data on long-term safety of erythropoietic-stimulating agents in CML patients. METHODS: The records of chronic phase CML patients who received treatment with imatinib were reviewed for use of erythropoietic-stimulating agents and occurrence of thrombotic events. Data on cytogenetic response and survival were analyzed by use of erythropoietic-stimulating agent. RESULTS: A total of 608 patients were included, and 217 patients received erythropoietic-stimulating agents. There were 30 thrombotic episodes. Patients who received erythropoietic-stimulating agents had a higher rate of thrombosis (8.5% vs 2.6%, P = .0025). There was no difference in cytogenetic response rate and survival by use of erythropoietic-stimulating agent. Development of grade 3-4 anemia occurred in 62 (10%) patients and was associated with significantly worse response and survival in patients in late chronic phase. By multivariate analysis, use of erythropoietic-stimulating agents was not a risk factor for event-free survival. CONCLUSIONS: In our cohort of chronic phase CML patients, use of erythropoietic-stimulating agents did not impact survival or cytogenetic response rate, but was associated with a higher thrombosis rate.

In addition to chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), CD200 is expressed in other B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders, including hairy cell leukemia. In addition, neoplastic cells in classical Hodgkin lymphoma are immunoreactive for CD200. CD200 was previously reported to be expressed in acute myeloid leukemia, and we find that it is also expressed in B-lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma. We conclude that CD200 may be a useful immunophenotypic marker in the evaluation of B cell-derived neoplasms.

This provides a rationale for the development of small molecule inhibitors that selectively target p110delta as a treatment approach for patients with B-cell malignancies. We thus identified 5-fluoro-3-phenyl-2-[(S)-1-(9H-purin-6-ylamino)-propyl]-3H-quinazolin-4-one (CAL-101), a highly selective and potent p110delta small molecule inhibitor (half-maximal effective concentration [EC(50)] = 8nM). Using tumor cell lines and primary patient samples representing multiple B-cell malignancies, we have demonstrated that constitutive phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase pathway activation is p110delta-dependent. CAL-101 blocked constitutive phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase signaling, resulting in decreased phosphorylation of Akt and other downstream effectors, an increase in poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase and caspase cleavage and an induction of apoptosis. These effects have been observed across a broad range of immature and mature B-cell malignancies, thereby providing a rationale for the ongoing clinical evaluation of CAL-101.","['Calistoga Pharmaceuticals Inc, Seattle, WA, USA. blannutti@calistogapharma.com']",['P50 CA140158/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC3694505,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2010 Oct 19.,"Specific interactions of transcription factors (TFs) with their targets are crucial for specifying gene expression programs during cell differentiation. How specificity is maintained despite limited selectivity of individual TF-DNA interactions is not fully understood. RUNX1 TF is among the most frequently mutated genes in human leukemia and an important regulator of megakaryopoiesis. We used megakaryocytic cell lines to characterize the network of RUNX1 targets and cooperating TFs in differentiating megakaryocytes and demonstrated how dynamic partnerships between RUNX1 and cooperating TFs facilitated regulatory plasticity and specificity during this process. After differentiation onset, RUNX1 directly activated a large number of genes through interaction with preexisting and de novo binding sites. Recruitment of RUNX1 to de novo occupied sites occurred at H3K4me1-marked preprogrammed enhancers. A significant number of these de novo bound sites lacked RUNX motif but were occupied by AP-1 TFs. Reciprocally, AP-1 TFs were up-regulated by RUNX1 after 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate induction and recruited to RUNX1-occupied sites lacking AP-1 motifs. At other differentiation stages, additional combinatorial interactions occurred between RUNX1 and its coregulators, GATA1 and ETS. The findings suggest that in differentiating megakaryocytic cell lines, RUNX1 cooperates with GATA1, AP-1, and ETS to orchestrate cell-specific transcription programs through dynamic TF partnerships.","['Department of Molecular Genetics, The Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type gamma (PTPRG) is a tumor suppressor gene and a myeloid cell marker expressed by CD34(+) cells. Downregulation of PTPRG increases colony formation in the PTPRG-positive megakaryocytic cell lines MEG-01 and LAMA-84 but has no effect in the PTPRG-negative cell lines K562 and KYO-1. Its overexpression has an oncosuppressive effect in all these cell lines and is associated with myeloid differentiation and inhibition of BCR/ABL-dependent signaling. The intracellular domain of PTPRG directly interacts with BCR/ABL and CRKL, but not with signal transducers and activators of transcription 5. PTPRG is downregulated at the mRNA and protein levels in leukocytes of CML patients in both peripheral blood and bone marrow, including CD34(+) cells, and is reexpressed following molecular remission of disease. Reexpression was associated with a loss of methylation of a CpG island of PTPRG promoter occurring in 55% of the patients analyzed. In K562 cell line, the DNA hypomethylating agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine induced PTPRG expression and caused an inhibition of colony formation, partially reverted by downregulation of PTPRG expression. These findings establish, for the first time, PTPRG as a tumor suppressor gene involved in the pathogenesis of CML, suggesting its use as a potential diagnostic and therapeutic target.","['Department of Pathology and Diagnostics, University of Verona, Verona, Italy.']",,,,,['(c)2010 AACR.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2010 Oct 19.,"Signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (Stat3) is activated by cytokines and growth factors in lung cancers and regulates expression of genes implicated in cell growth, survival, and transformation. Previously, we found that mice with a deletion of the G protein-coupled receptor, family C, group 5, member a (Gprc5a) gene develop lung tumors, indicating that Gprc5a is a tumor suppressor. Herein, we show that epithelial cells from Gprc5a knockout mouse lung (Gprc5a(-/-) cells) survive better in vitro in medium deprived of exogenous growth factors and form more colonies in semisolid medium than their counterparts from wild-type mice (Gprc5a(+/+) cells). Stat3 tyrosine 705 phosphorylation and expression of several Stat3-regulated antiapoptotic genes were higher in Gprc5a(-/-) than in Gprc5a(+/+) cells. Both cell types secreted leukemia inhibitory factor (Lif); however, whereas Stat3 activation was persistent in Gprc5a(-/-) cells, it was transient in Gprc5a(+/+) cells. Lung adenocarcinoma cells isolated from Gprc5a(-/-) mice also exhibited autocrine Lif-mediated Stat3 activation. The level of Socs3, the endogenous Stat3 inhibitory protein, was higher in Gprc5a(+/+) than in Gprc5a(-/-) cells, and expression of the tumor suppressor stabilized Socs3. Inhibition of Stat3 signaling in Gprc5a(-/-) normal and cancer cells by the Janus-activated kinase 2 inhibitor AG490 or by a dominant negative Stat3(Y705F) increased starvation-induced apoptosis and inhibited colony formation. These results show that persistent Stat3 activation is important for the survival and transformation of Gprc5a(-/-) lung cells and suggest that the tumor suppressive effects of Gprc5a are mediated, at least in part, by inhibition of Stat3 signaling through Socs3 stabilization.","['Department of Thoracic/Head and Neck Medical Oncology, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.']","['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA16672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2970717,['NIHMS233783'],,['(c)2010 AACR.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using an in vitro dye-reduction assay, we determined the level of glycolytic metabolism in 26 BM samples taken from 23 adult patients with newly diagnosed (n=19) or relapsed (n=4) AML, and AML blasts stratified into two distinct cohorts of moderate (<70%) or high (>80%) levels of glycolytic metabolism. All samples taken at relapse were moderately glycolytic. However, nine of the 19 samples taken at diagnosis were highly glycolytic, and 10 were moderately glycolytic. Three patients had paired samples taken at diagnosis and relapse, and the glycolytic metabolism of these samples did not alter between the two time-points. The level of glycolytic metabolism did not correlate with the percentage of marrow blasts, patient age, or CG/molecular risk group. Highly glycolytic AML blasts were more resistant to apoptosis induced by ATRA and/or ATO in vitro, suggesting potential resistance to induction chemotherapy, as has been observed in solid tumors. Despite this, high levels of glycolytic metabolism at diagnosis were predictive of a significantly improved duration of CR1 and OS following AML remission induction chemotherapy. In conclusion, we found that the extent of myeloblast glycolysis may be an effective and easily applied method to determine the pretreatment prognosis of AML.","['Malaghan Institute of Medical Research, Wellington, New Zealand.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Peripheral blood DNAs were genotyped for 79 single nucleotide polymorphism markers involved in the pathways of apoptosis, angiogenesis, myeloid cell growth, xenobiotic metabolism, WT1 signaling, IFN signaling, and others in CML patients who were included in discovery (n = 229, Canada) and validation cohorts (n = 187, Korea). RESULTS: We found several genotypes associated with complete cytogenetic response: IFNG (rs1861494, rs2069705), FASL (rs763110), FAS (rs2234767, rs2234978), VEGFR2 (rs1531289), and WT1 (rs2234590); with major molecular response: IFNG (rs1861494, rs2069705), BIRC5 (rs9904341), FAS (rs2234978), and ABCG2 (rs2231142); with loss of response: IFNG (rs2069705), IFNGR2 (rs9808753), BIRC5 (rs9904341), and ORM (rs3182041); and with treatment failure: IFNG (rs2069705), JAK3 (rs3212713), and ORM (rs3182041). External validation for the above significant genotypes confirmed that the IFNG genotype (rs2069705) was predictive of complete cytogenetic response (hazard ratio, 2.17; P < 0.001) and major molecular response (hazard ratio, 1.96; P = 0.0001) in validation cohorts of Korean ethnicity. CONCLUSIONS: The IFNG genotype was predictive for response to imatinib therapy, suggesting potential involvement of the IFN-gamma signaling pathway in the mechanism of action of imatinib in CML.","['Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia Group, Department of Hematology/Medical Oncology, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea. drkiim@medimail.co.kr']",,,,,['(c)2010 AACR.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2010 Oct 19.,"Epigenetics refers to stable alterations in gene expression with no underlying modifications in the genetic sequence and is best exemplified by differentiation, in which multiple cell types diverge physiologically despite a common genetic code. Interest in this area of science has grown over the past decades, especially since it was found to play a major role in physiologic phenomena such as embryogenesis, imprinting, and X chromosome inactivation, and in disease states such as cancer. The latter had been previously thought of as a disease with an exclusive genetic etiology. However, recent data have demonstrated that the complexity of human carcinogenesis cannot be accounted for by genetic alterations alone, but also involves epigenetic changes in processes such as DNA methylation, histone modifications, and microRNA expression. In turn, these molecular alterations lead to permanent changes in the expression of genes that regulate the neoplastic phenotype, such as cellular growth and invasiveness. Targeting epigenetic modifiers has been referred to as epigenetic therapy. The success of this approach in hematopoietic malignancies validates the importance of epigenetic alterations in cancer, not only at the therapeutic level but also with regard to prevention, diagnosis, risk stratification, and prognosis.","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.

Childhood and in utero exposure to moderate and high levels of ionizing radiation, such as those experienced during the atomic bombings of Japan, or from radiotherapy, is an established cause of leukaemia and solid cancer. There is no evidence of increase in solid cancers (excluding thyroid cancer) or leukaemia in the children from Chernobyl, and no evident link between worker's exposure to radiation and leukaemia in their offspring or with the presence of leukaemia clusters around nuclear power plants. It has also not been possible to demonstrate the evidence of radiation hereditary effects in human populations. In accordance with international guidance, Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission recommends optimisation of protection strategies to reduce doses to children. The development of credible radiological/nuclear event scenarios would assist in identifying probable sources of radioactivity and pathways of exposure for children. Such scenarios should then be used to identify protection strategies appropriate for children.","['Radiation and Health Sciences Division, Directorate of Environmental and Radiation Protection and Assessment, Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission, Ottawa, ON, Canada.

Epub 2010 Nov 12.,"Lymphocytes are central to the progression of autoimmune disease, transplant rejection, leukemia, lymphoma and lymphocyte-resident viral diseases such as HIV/AIDs. Strategies to target drug treatments to lymphocytes, therefore, represent an opportunity to enhance therapeutic outcomes in disease states where many current treatment regimes are incompletely effective and promote significant toxicities. Here we demonstrate that highly lipophilic drug candidates that preferentially access the intestinal lymphatics after oral administration show significantly enhanced access to lymphocytes leading to improved immunomodulatory activity. When coadministered with such drugs, lipids enhance lymphocyte targeting via a three tiered action: promotion of drug absorption from the gastrointestinal tract, enhancement of lymphatic drug transport and stimulation of lymphocyte recruitment into the lymphatics. This strategy has been exemplified using a highly lipophilic immunosuppressant (JWH015) where coadministration with selected lipids led to significant increases in lymphatic transport, lymphocyte targeting and IL-4 and IL-10 expression in CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes after ex vivo mitogen stimulation. In contrast, administration of a 2.5-fold higher dose of JWH015 in a formulation that did not stimulate lymph transport had no effect on antiinflammatory cytokine levels, in spite of equivalent drug exposure in the blood. The current data suggest that complementary drug design and delivery strategies that combine highly lipophilic, lymphotropic drug candidates with lymph-directing formulations provide enhanced selectivity, potency and therapeutic potential for drug candidates with lymphocyte associated targets.","['Drug Delivery, Disposition and Dynamics, Monash Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Monash University, 381 Royal Parade, Parkville, Victoria, Australia.']",,,,,,,,,,,,['Mol Pharm. 2011 Dec 5;8(6):2484'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2010 Oct 18.,"BACKGROUND: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in first relapse is associated with a poor outcome even when treated with intermediate- to high-dose cytarabine (IHDAraC). Gemtuzumab ozogamycin (GO) used as a single agent has clinical activity in relapsed and refractory AML. Various combination regimens of GO have been developed, but few data are available regarding their efficacy compared with IHDAraC-based regimens. METHODS: The authors performed a retrospective analysis of response and survival in 90 AML patients in first relapse treated with either IHDAraC (n = 56) or IHDAraC + GO (n = 34). Patient characteristics of the two groups were comparable. RESULTS: Median follow-up was 37 months. Compared with IHDAraC, IHDAraC + GO induction was associated with a better response rate (68% vs 45%, P = .04), a better overall survival (median, 35 months vs 6 months, P = .001), and a better event-free survival (24 months vs 6 months, P = .002). This effect was limited to patients with low-risk and intermediate-risk cytogenetics. In multivariate analysis, age, cytogenetic risk, first complete remission duration, and the use of IHDAraC + GO were independently associated with better results. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that the addition of GO to IHDAraC is associated with a better efficacy for patients in first relapse of AML with low- or intermediate-risk cytogenetics.

Women under age 85 years participating in the California Teachers Study with no history of hematopoietic cancer were followed from 1995 through 2007. A total of 516 of 114,131 women eligible for OC use analysis and 402 of 54,758 postmenopausal women eligible for MHT use analysis developed B-cell NHL. Multivariable adjusted and age stratified Cox proportional hazards models were fit to estimate relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Ever versus never OC use was marginally associated with lower B-cell NHL risk, particularly among women first using OCs before age 25 years (RR=0.72, 95% CI=0.51-0.99); yet, no duration-response effect was observed. No association was observed for ever versus never MHT use among postmenopausal women (RR=1.05, 95% CI=0.83-1.33) overall or by formulation (estrogen alone, ET, or estrogen plus progestin, EPT). Among women with no MHT use, having bilateral oophorectomy plus hysterectomy was associated with greater B-cell NHL risk than having natural menopause (RR=3.15, 95% CI=1.62-6.13). Bilateral oophorectomy plus hysterectomy was not associated with risk among women who used ET or EPT. These results indicate that exogenous hormone use does not strongly influence B-cell NHL risk.","['Department of Population Sciences, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope, Duarte, CA 91010, USA. yalu@coh.org']","['U55/CCR921930-02/PHS HHS/United States', 'N01-PC-35139/PC/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA077398-09/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N02 PC015105/PC/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K05 CA136967/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA077398/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA77398/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01PC35139/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-PC-35136/PC/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01PC35136/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K05 CA136967-01A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3258672,['NIHMS252388'],,['Copyright (c) 2010 UICC.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2010 Dec 17.,"In low and middle income countries (LMIC), high-quality disease registration is difficult to achieve in the setting of inadequate healthcare infrastructure and political or economical instability. In this article, we explore the potential of geographic information systems (GIS) to add value to the understanding of childhood cancer patterns in the West Bank, despite a variety of obstacles to disease registration. All incidence cases of childhood cancers (under the age 15) from 1998 to 2007 were collected from the West Bank Cancer Registry. Temporal, spatial and space-time analyses were performed using the SatScan software developed by Martin Kulldorff and the National Cancer Institute (NCI). The analyses were categorized into the following groups: all childhood cancer, leukemias, acute lymphocytic leukemia, lymphomas, brain and central nervous system (CNS) cancers and remaining cancers (excluding leukemia, lymphoma and CNS tumors). The temporal analysis revealed that cancer registration was more complete from 1998 to 2000 (p=0.0162), and that leukemia registration was severely deficient from 2003 to 2005 (p=0.0012). The spatial analysis showed a concentration of cancer in metropolitan districts where referral hospitals are based. Under registration was detected in the northern districts of Jenin and Tulkarm (RR=0.59, p=0.0059), more prominent from 2002 to 2005 (RR=0.33, p=0.0006). The analysis for high rates found a cluster of lymphoma in town of Dura and its surrounding agricultural villages (RR=4.10, p=0.0023). Our study reveals that the application of GIS tools to registry data in LMIC can help to identify geographical patterns in cancer registration and healthcare accessibility, generating priorities for future health research and policy in resource-limited areas.","['School of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, CA 94115, USA.']",,,,,['Copyright (c) 2010 UICC.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We examined if family characteristics, particularly maternal and paternal age and number of older siblings, were risk factors for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this population-based nationwide matched case-control study, patients 0-14 years of age with ALL diagnosed 1991-2006 and registered in the Swiss Childhood Cancer Registry were linked with their census records of 1990 and 2000. Eight controls per case were selected from the census. The association between family characteristics and ALL was analyzed by conditional logistic regressions. We found that increasing maternal age was associated with incidence of ALL in the offspring (OR per 5-year increase in maternal age 1.18, 95% CI 1.05-1.31; p = 0.004), remaining stable (trend OR 1.14, 95% CI 0.99-1.31; p = 0.060) after adjustment for other risk factors. The association with paternal age was weaker (OR per 5-year increase 1.14, 95% CI 1.01-1.28, p = 0.032) and disappeared after adjustments. Number of older siblings was not associated with risk of ALL in the overall group of children aged 0-14 years at diagnosis. However, we found a negative trend between number of older siblings and ALL diagnosed at age 0-4 years (OR per sibling 0.85, 95% CI 0.68-1.06; p = 0.141) and a positive trend for ALL diagnosed at age 5-9 (OR 1.34, 95% CI 1.05-1.72; p = 0.019), with some evidence for an effect modification (p-value for interaction = 0.040). CONCLUSIONS: As in other studies, increasing maternal, but not paternal age was associated with risk of ALL. We found only a weak association with the number of older siblings, suggesting a delay in disease manifestation rather than a decrease in incidence.","['Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.']",,PMC2949397,,,,,,,"['Swiss Pediatric Oncology Group (SPOG)', 'Swiss National Cohort (SNC)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For stable reversal of ""classical"" MDR by short hairpin RNA (shRNA) aiming directly at the target sequence (3491-3509, 1539-1557, and 3103-3121 nucleotide) of MDR1 mRNA. PGC silencer-U6-neo-GFP-shRNA/MDR1 called PGY1-1, PGY1-2, and PGY1-3 were constructed and transfected into K562/A02 cells by lipofectamine 2000. After transfected and incubated with or without MNP (Fe(3)O(4)) for 48 hours, the transcription of MDR1 mRNA and the expression of P-gp were detected by quantitative real-time PCR and Western-blot assay respectively. Meanwhile intracellular concentration of DNR in K562/A02 cells was detected by flow cytometry (FCM). PGC silencer-U6-neo-GFP-shRNA/MDR1 was successfully constructed, which was confirmed by sequencing and PGY1-2 had the greatest MDR1 gene inhibitory ratio. Analysis of the reversal ratio of MDR, the concentration of daunorubicin (DNR) and the transcription of MDR1 gene and expression of P-gp in K562/A02 showed that combination of DNR with either MNP (Fe(3)O(4)) or PGY1-2 exerted a potent cytotoxic effect on K562/A02 cells, while combination of MNP (Fe(3)O(4)) and PGY1-2 could synergistically reverse multidrug resistance.

The currently available clinical staging systems for CLL are simple and inexpensive but lack accuracy to predict disease progression and survival on an individual basis. The increased understanding of the key events of molecular pathogenesis has provided a plethora of novel molecular and biological factors that correlate with the outcome of CLL. This Review provides a concise discussion of the most important discoveries and gives guidance on how to implement novel prognostic tools in the clinical management of CLL by applying the criteria of evidence, relevance, and simplicity to the selection of prognostic markers.","['Department of Internal Medicine I, Center for Integrated Oncology Koln-Bonn, University of Cologne, Germany.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previously, we cloned the N-terminal RASSF10 gene and demonstrated frequent methylation of the associated 5'-CpG island in acute lymphoblastic leukemia. To characterize RASSF10 gene expression, we demonstrate that in developing Xenopus embryos, RASSF10 shows a very striking pattern in the rhombencephalon (hind brain). It is also expressed in other parts of the brain and other organs. Due to the well-defined expression pattern in the brain of Xenopus embryos, we analyzed the methylation status of the RASSF10-associated 5'-CpG island in astrocytic gliomas. RASSF10 was frequently methylated in WHO grade II-III astrocytomas and WHO grade IV primary glioblastomas (67.5%), but was unmethylated in grade I astrocytomas and in DNA from age matched control brain samples. RASSF10 gene expression both at the mRNA and protein levels could be switched back on in methylated glioma cell lines after treatment with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine. In secondary glioblastomas (sGBM), RASSF10 methylation was an independent prognostic factor associated with worst progression-free survival and overall survival and occurred at an early stage in their development. In cell culture experiments, overexpression of RASSF10 mediated a reduction in the colony forming ability of two RASSF10-methylated glioma cell lines. Conversely, RNAi-mediated knockdown of RASSF10-stimulated anchorage-independent growth of U87 glioma cells, increased their viability and caused an increase in the cells' proliferative ability. We generated and characterized a RASSF10-specific antibody and demonstrated for the first time that RASSF10 subcellular localization is cell-cycle dependent with RASSF10 colocalizing to centrosomes and associated microtubules during mitosis. This is the first report demonstrating that RASSF10 can act as a tumor suppressor gene and is frequently methylated in gliomas and can potentially be developed into a prognostic marker for sGBM.","['Medical and Molecular Genetics, School of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, College of Medical and Dental Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
