Pattern-recognition receptors present on the surfaces of innate immune cells recognize fungal pathogens and activate the first line of defense against fungal infection. The second line of defense is the adaptive immune system which involves mainly CD4(+) T cells, while CD8(+) T cells also play a role. CD8(+) T cell-based vaccines designed to prevent IFIs are currently being investigated in clinical trials, their use could play an especially important role in acquired immune deficiency syndrome patients. So far, none of the vaccines used to treat IFI have been approved by the FDA. Here, we review current and future antifungal immunotherapy strategies involving CD8(+) T cells. We highlight recent advances in the use of T cells engineered using a Sleeping Beauty vector to treat IFIs. Recent clinical trials using chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy to treat patients with leukemia have shown very promising results. We hypothesized that CAR T cells could also be used to control IFI. Therefore, we designed a CAR that targets beta-glucan, a sugar molecule found in most of the fungal cell walls, using the extracellular domain of Dectin-1, which binds to beta-glucan. Mice treated with D-CAR(+) T cells displayed reductions in hyphal growth of Aspergillus compared to the untreated group. Patients suffering from IFIs due to primary immunodeficiency, secondary immunodeficiency (e.g., HIV), or hematopoietic transplant patients may benefit from bioengineered CAR T cell therapy.","['Kumaresan, Pappanaicken R', 'da Silva, Thiago Aparecido', 'Kontoyiannis, Dimitrios P']","['Kumaresan PR', 'da Silva TA', 'Kontoyiannis DP']","['Department of Pediatrics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, United States.', 'Department of Pediatrics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, United States.', 'Department of Infectious Diseases, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, United States.']",['eng'],"['P01 CA148600/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 AI127381/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA116127/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R33 CA116127/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Review']",20180108,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,PMC5766637,['NOTNLM'],"['CD8+ T cells', 'D-CAR+ T cells', 'Sleeping Beauty', 'adoptive T cell therapy', 'cell therapy', 'chimeric antigen receptor', 'fungal infection', 'immunotherapy']",2018/01/24 06:00,2018/01/24 06:01,['2018/01/24 06:00'],"['2017/10/31 00:00 [received]', '2017/12/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/01/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/24 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2017.01939 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2018 Jan 8;8:1939. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2017.01939. eCollection 2017.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The gate-keeper mutation T315I is the most challenging mutant due to its resistance to most tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). The third generation TKI ponatinib is the only effective TKI to treat CML patients harboring T315I-BCR-ABL mutation, but with high rate of major arterial thrombotic events. Alternative strategies to specifically target T315I-BCR-ABL are needed for the treatment of CML patients harboring such a mutation. Given that Sp1 is a fundamental transcriptional factor to positively regulate WT-BCR-ABL fusion oncogene, the purpose of this investigation was aimed at evaluating the anti-tumor activity and the underlying mechanism in terms of Sp1 regulational effect on the transcription of T315I-BCR-ABL fusion oncogene. Like in WT-BCR-ABL, we identified enrichment of Sp1 on the promoter of T315I-BCR-ABL fusion gene. Treatment of WT- and T315I-BCR-ABL-expressing CML cells by niclosamide diminished such an enrichment of Sp1, and decreased WT- and T315I-BCR-ABL transcription and its downstream signaling molecules such as STAT5 and Akt. Further, niclosamide significantly inhibited the proliferation and induced apoptosis through intrinsic pathway. The in vivo efficacy validation of p-niclosamide, a water soluble derivative of niclosamide, showed that p-niclosamide significantly inhibited the tumor burden of nude mice subcutaneously bearing T315I-BCR-ABL-expressing CML cells, and prolonged the survival of allografted leukemic mice harboring BaF3-T315I-BCR-ABL. We conclude that niclosamide is active against T315I-BCR-ABL-expressing cells, and may be a promising agent for CML patients regardless of T315I mutation status.","['Jin, Bei', 'Wang, Chengyan', 'Shen, Yingying', 'Pan, Jingxuan']","['Jin B', 'Wang C', 'Shen Y', 'Pan J']","['Department of Pathophysiology, Zhongshan School of Medicine Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Pathophysiology, Zhongshan School of Medicine Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Ophthalmology, Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center; Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Brain Function and Disease, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China. panjx2@mail.sysu.edu.cn.', 'Jinan University Institute of Tumor Pharmacology, College of Pharmacy, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China. panjx2@mail.sysu.edu.cn.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180122,England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,PMC5833368,,,2018/01/24 06:00,2019/06/18 06:00,['2018/01/24 06:00'],"['2017/06/14 00:00 [received]', '2017/09/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/09/13 00:00 [revised]', '2018/01/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/01/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/18 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41419-017-0075-7 [doi]', '10.1038/s41419-017-0075-7 [pii]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2018 Jan 22;9(2):68. doi: 10.1038/s41419-017-0075-7.,20190617,2,"['0 (Anthelmintics)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Sp1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein)', '0 (XIAP protein, human)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', '8KK8CQ2K8G (Niclosamide)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anthelmintics/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects/genetics', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics/metabolism', 'Imatinib Mesylate/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/pathology', 'Mice, Nude', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Models, Biological', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/metabolism', 'Niclosamide/*pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Sp1 Transcription Factor/*metabolism', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transcription, Genetic/*drug effects', 'X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein/metabolism', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although promyelocytic leukemia zinc-finger protein (PLZF) was reported to be deregulated in numerous cancers and also relevant to clinical prognosis, its role in GBC progression has been little known. In this study, we found PLZF expression was decreased in GBC, correlating to advanced TNM stage, distant metastasis, and shorter overall survival. Moreover, ectopic PLZF expression in GBC cells (NOZ and GBC-SD) significantly reduced the cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Consistently, overexpression of PLZF in xenograft mice model could suppress tumor growth and liver metastasis. Mechanical investigations verified PLZF could regulate the expression of cell cycle arrest-associated gene p21 and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related genes (E-cadherin and N-cadherin) in GBC cell lines. Importantly, PLZF remarkably increased the mRNA transcription of interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeat 2 (IFIT2) by increasing STAT1 protein level, a known factor involved in tumor progression. Furthermore, ablation of IFIT2 in PLZF overexpression cells abrogated the tumor-suppressive function of PLZF, at least partially, leading to impaired tumor growth and EMT program. These studies indicated PLZF inhibited the proliferation and metastasis via regulation of IFIT2. In conclusion, our study demonstrated PLZF could be a promising tumor biomarker for GBC, and also be a potential therapeutic target.","['Shen, Hui', 'Zhan, Ming', 'Zhang, Yonglong', 'Huang, Shuai', 'Xu, Sunwang', 'Huang, Xince', 'He, Min', 'Yao, Yanhua', 'Man, Mohan', 'Wang, Jian']","['Shen H', 'Zhan M', 'Zhang Y', 'Huang S', 'Xu S', 'Huang X', 'He M', 'Yao Y', 'Man M', 'Wang J']","['Department of Biliary-Pancreatic Surgery, Renji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, 1630 Dongfang Road, Shanghai, 200127, China.', 'Department of Biliary-Pancreatic Surgery, Renji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, 1630 Dongfang Road, Shanghai, 200127, China.', 'Department of Biliary-Pancreatic Surgery, Renji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, 1630 Dongfang Road, Shanghai, 200127, China.', 'Department of Biliary-Pancreatic Surgery, Renji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, 1630 Dongfang Road, Shanghai, 200127, China.', 'Department of Biliary-Pancreatic Surgery, Renji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, 1630 Dongfang Road, Shanghai, 200127, China.', 'Department of Biliary-Pancreatic Surgery, Renji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, 1630 Dongfang Road, Shanghai, 200127, China.', 'Department of Biliary-Pancreatic Surgery, Renji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, 1630 Dongfang Road, Shanghai, 200127, China.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Cell Biology, Shanghai Key Laboratory of Tumor Microenvironment and Inflammation, Institutes of Medical Sciences, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, 200025, China.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Cell Biology, Shanghai Key Laboratory of Tumor Microenvironment and Inflammation, Institutes of Medical Sciences, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, 200025, China.', 'Department of Biliary-Pancreatic Surgery, Renji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, 1630 Dongfang Road, Shanghai, 200127, China. dr_wangjian@126.com.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180122,England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,PMC5833736,,,2018/01/24 06:00,2019/06/19 06:00,['2018/01/24 06:00'],"['2017/05/23 00:00 [received]', '2017/10/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/10/23 00:00 [revised]', '2018/01/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/01/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/19 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41419-017-0107-3 [doi]', '10.1038/s41419-017-0107-3 [pii]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2018 Jan 22;9(2):71. doi: 10.1038/s41419-017-0107-3.,20190618,2,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (IFIT2 protein, human)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (STAT1 Transcription Factor)', '147855-37-6 (ZBTB16 protein, human)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Down-Regulation/genetics', 'Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition', 'Female', 'Gallbladder Neoplasms/genetics/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice, Nude', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Prognosis', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein/*metabolism', 'Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA-Binding Proteins', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) establishes persistent infection mainly in CD4+ T cells in vivo and induces leukemia in this subset. HTLV-1-encoded Tax is a critical transactivator of viral replication and a potent oncoprotein, but its significance in pathogenesis remains obscure due to its very low level of expression in vivo. Here, we show that Tax is expressed in a minor fraction of leukemic cells at any given time, and importantly, its expression spontaneously switches between on and off states. Live cell imaging revealed that the average duration of one episode of Tax expression is approximately 19 hours. Knockdown of Tax rapidly induced apoptosis in most cells, indicating that Tax is critical for maintaining the population, even if its short-term expression is limited to a small subpopulation. Single-cell analysis and computational simulation suggest that transient Tax expression triggers antiapoptotic machinery, and this effect continues even after Tax expression is diminished; this activation of the antiapoptotic machinery is the critical event for maintaining the population. In addition, Tax is induced by various cytotoxic stresses and also promotes HTLV-1 replication. Thus, it seems that Tax protects infected cells from apoptosis and increases the chance of viral transmission at a critical moment. Keeping the expression of Tax minimal but inducible on demand is, therefore, a fundamental strategy of HTLV-1 to promote persistent infection and leukemogenesis.","['Mahgoub, Mohamed', 'Yasunaga, Jun-Ichirou', 'Iwami, Shingo', 'Nakaoka, Shinji', 'Koizumi, Yoshiki', 'Shimura, Kazuya', 'Matsuoka, Masao']","['Mahgoub M', 'Yasunaga JI', 'Iwami S', 'Nakaoka S', 'Koizumi Y', 'Shimura K', 'Matsuoka M']","['Laboratory of Virus Control, Institute for Frontier Life and Medical Sciences, Kyoto University, Kyoto 606-8507, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Virus Control, Institute for Frontier Life and Medical Sciences, Kyoto University, Kyoto 606-8507, Japan; jyasunag@infront.kyoto-u.ac.jp mamatsu@kumamoto-u.ac.jp.', 'Mathematical Biology Laboratory, Department of Biology, Faculty of Sciences, Kyushu University, Fukuoka 819-0395, Japan.', 'Precursory Research for Embryonic Science and Technology (PRESTO), Japan Science and Technology Agency, Saitama 332-0012, Japan.', 'Core Research for Evolutional Science and Technology (CREST), Japan Science and Technology Agency, Saitama 332-0012, Japan.', 'Precursory Research for Embryonic Science and Technology (PRESTO), Japan Science and Technology Agency, Saitama 332-0012, Japan.', 'Institute of Industrial Sciences, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo 153-8505, Japan.', 'School of Medicine, College of Medical, Pharmaceutical and Health Sciences, Kanazawa University, Ishikawa 920-8640, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Virus Control, Institute for Frontier Life and Medical Sciences, Kyoto University, Kyoto 606-8507, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Virus Control, Institute for Frontier Life and Medical Sciences, Kyoto University, Kyoto 606-8507, Japan; jyasunag@infront.kyoto-u.ac.jp mamatsu@kumamoto-u.ac.jp.', 'Department of Hematology, Rheumatology and Infectious Diseases, Kumamoto University School of Medicine, Kumamoto 860-8556, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180122,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,PMC5819419,['NOTNLM'],"['*HBZ', '*HTLV-1', '*Tax', '*adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma', '*computational simulation']",2018/01/24 06:00,2018/07/25 06:00,['2018/01/24 06:00'],"['2018/01/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/07/25 06:00 [medline]', '2018/01/24 06:00 [entrez]']","['1715724115 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1715724115 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2018 Feb 6;115(6):E1269-E1278. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1715724115.

In this study, we sought to better understand the mechanisms of apoptotic regulation in normal and activated B cells. Using intracellular BH3 profiling, we defined the Bcl2 dependency of B cell subsets from human peripheral blood and tonsillar lymphoid tissue as well as mitogen-activated B cells. We found that naive and memory B cells were BCL-2-dependent, whereas germinal center B cells were MCL-1-dependent and plasma cells were BCL-XL-dependent. B cells stimulated to proliferate ex vivo by CpG or CD40L/IL-4 became more dependent on MCL-1 and BCL-XL As B cell lymphomas often rely on survival mechanisms derived from normal and activated B cells, these findings offer new insight into potential therapeutic strategies for lymphomas.","['Dai, Joanne', 'Luftig, Micah A']","['Dai J', 'Luftig MA']","['Department of Molecular Genetics and Microbiology, Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, NC 27710; and Center for Virology, Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, NC 27710.', 'Department of Molecular Genetics and Microbiology, Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, NC 27710; and Center for Virology, Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, NC 27710 micah.luftig@duke.edu.']",['eng'],"['P30 AI064518/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA140337/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DE025994/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA009111/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180122,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,PMC5821561,,,2018/01/24 06:00,2019/02/16 06:00,['2018/01/24 06:00'],"['2017/10/23 00:00 [received]', '2017/12/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/02/16 06:00 [medline]', '2018/01/24 06:00 [entrez]']","['jimmunol.1701473 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1701473 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2018 Mar 1;200(5):1727-1736. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1701473.

However, no previous study has examined the impact of CD on risk of infant leukemia specifically.Methods: In this study, 443 infants diagnosed with acute leukemia, including both ALL and acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), were identified at Children's Oncology Group institutions between January 1996 and December 2006; 324 controls frequency matched by year of birth were identified though random digit dialing and random selection from U.S. birth registries. Using interview data and, for a subset of participants, medical record data, we analyzed CD overall and by indications that likely resulted in pre-labor CD (PLCD) or emergency CD (ECD). Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for risk of ALL and AML were estimated using multivariable unconditional logistic regression models, adjusted for year of birth, birth weight, and maternal race.Results: We observed an increased point estimate for the association between CD and ALL (OR, 1.52 and 95% CI, 1.02-2.25). We did not observe an association between CD and AML (OR, 1.02 and 95% CI, 0.64-1.62). In analyses of indication for CD, we observed elevated effect estimates for the associations of both PLCD and ECD and infant ALL.Conclusions: Our analysis suggests an increased risk of infant ALL following CD, including both PLCD and ECD. Altered microbiota colonization may be involved in development of leukemia in infants, but clear biological mechanisms have yet to be determined.Impact: This study provides the first in-depth examination of CD and infant leukemia.

However, data in humans are limited.Methods: We examined marine omega-3 PUFAs and fish intake and survival among 1,011 colon cancer patients enrolled in Cancer and Leukemia Group B 89803 between 1999 and 2001 and followed through 2009. Diet was assessed during and 6 months after chemotherapy. We used Cox proportional hazards regression to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for disease-free (DFS), recurrence-free (RFS), and overall survival (OS).Results: We observed 343 recurrences and 305 deaths (median follow-up: 7 years). Patients in the highest vs. lowest quartile of marine omega-3 PUFA intake had an HR for DFS of 0.72 (95% CI, 0.54-0.97; Ptrend = 0.03).

We performed targeted capture sequencing of 295 cancer genes in specimens from 102 CLL patients with treatment-naive disease (TN patients) and 186 CLL patients with relapsed/refractory disease (R/R patients) who received lenalidomide-based therapy at our institution. The most frequently mutated gene was SF3B1 (15%), followed by NOTCH1 (14%) and TP53 (14%), with R/R patients having significantly more TP53 mutations than did TN patients. Among all lenalidomide-treated patients, del(17p) (P </= .001), del(11q) (P = .032), and complex karyotype (P = .022), along with mutations in TP53 (P </= .001), KRAS (P = .034), and DDX3X (P </= .001), were associated with worse overall response (OR). R/R patients with SF3B1 and MGA mutations had significantly worse OR (P = .025 and .035, respectively). TN and R/R patients with del(17p) and TP53 mutations had worse overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). In R/R patients, complex karyotype and SF3B1 mutations were associated with worse OS and PFS; DDX3X mutations were associated with worse PFS only. Weibull regression multivariate analysis revealed that TP53 aberrations (del(17p), TP53 mutation, or both), along with complex karyotype and SF3B1 mutations, were associated with worse OS in the R/R cohort. Taken together, cancer gene mutations in CLL contribute to the already comprehensive risk stratification and add to prognosis and response to treatment.

MRD is the strongest predictor of relapse in ALL. In this open-label, single-arm study, adults with B-cell precursor ALL in hematologic complete remission with MRD (>/=10(-3)) received blinatumomab 15 microg/m(2) per day by continuous IV infusion for up to 4 cycles. Patients could undergo allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation any time after cycle 1. The primary end point was complete MRD response status after 1 cycle of blinatumomab. One hundred sixteen patients received blinatumomab. Eighty-eight (78%) of 113 evaluable patients achieved a complete MRD response. In the subgroup of 110 patients with Ph-negative ALL in hematologic remission, the Kaplan-Meier estimate of relapse-free survival (RFS) at 18 months was 54%. Median overall survival (OS) was 36.5 months. In landmark analyses, complete MRD responders had longer RFS (23.6 vs 5.7 months; P = .002) and OS (38.9 vs 12.5 months; P = .002) compared with MRD nonresponders. Adverse events were consistent with previous studies of blinatumomab. Twelve (10%) and 3 patients (3%) had grade 3 or 4 neurologic events, respectively. Four patients (3%) had cytokine release syndrome grade 1, n = 2; grade 3, n = 2), all during cycle 1. After treatment with blinatumomab in a population of patients with MRD-positive B-cell precursor ALL, a majority achieved a complete MRD response, which was associated with significantly longer RFS and OS compared with MRD nonresponders.

Its most successful embodiment to date is based on the use of second-generation chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) targeting CD19, a cell surface molecule found in most B-cell leukemias and lymphomas. Remarkable complete remissions have been obtained with autologous T cells expressing CD19 CARs in patients with relapsed, chemo-refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Allogeneic CAR T cells may also be harnessed to treat relapse after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. However, the use of donor T cells poses unique challenges owing to potential alloreactivity. We review different approaches to mitigate the risk of causing or aggravating graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), including CAR therapies based on donor leukocyte infusion, virus-specific T cells, T-cell receptor-deficient T cells, lymphoid progenitor cells, and regulatory T cells. Advances in CAR design, T-cell selection and gene editing are poised to enable the safe use of allogeneic CAR T cells without incurring GVHD.","['Smith, Melody', 'Zakrzewski, Johannes', 'James, Scott', 'Sadelain, Michel']","['Smith M', 'Zakrzewski J', 'James S', 'Sadelain M']","['Center for Cell Engineering and Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Center for Cell Engineering and Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Center for Cell Engineering and Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Center for Cell Engineering and Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.']",['eng'],['P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review', 'Video-Audio Media']",20180122,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,PMC5865610,,,2018/01/24 06:00,2019/03/20 06:00,['2018/01/24 06:00'],"['2017/08/24 00:00 [received]', '2017/12/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/20 06:00 [medline]', '2018/01/24 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)32412-5 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2017-08-752121 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2018 Mar 8;131(10):1045-1052. doi: 10.1182/blood-2017-08-752121.

After allogeneic transplantation, NK cells are the first reconstituting lymphocytes, but are dysfunctional. Manipulating this first wave of lymphocytes could be instrumental in reducing the 40% relapse rate following transplantation with reduced-intensity conditioning. NK cells express numerous activating and inhibitory receptors. Some recognize classical or nonclassical HLA class I ligands, others recognize class I-like ligands or unrelated ligands. Dominant in the NK-cell transplant literature are killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs), encoded on chromosome 19q. Inhibitory KIR recognition of the cognate HLA class I ligand is responsible for NK-cell education, which makes them tolerant of healthy cells, but responsive to unhealthy cells having reduced expression of HLA class I. KIR A and KIR B are functionally distinctive KIR haplotype groups that differ in KIR gene content. Allogeneic transplant donors having a KIR B haplotype and lacking a recipient HLA-C epitope provide protection against relapse from acute myeloid leukemia. Cytomegalovirus infection stimulates and expands a distinctive NK-cell population that expresses the NKG2C receptor and exhibits enhanced effector functions. These adaptive NK cells display immune memory and methylation signatures like CD8 T cells. As potential therapy, NK cells, including adaptive NK cells, can be adoptively transferred with, or without, agents such as interleukin-15 that promote NK-cell survival. Strategies combining NK-cell infusions with CD16-binding antibodies or immune engagers could make NK cells antigen specific. Together with checkpoint inhibitors, these approaches have considerable potential as anticancer therapies.","['Cooley, Sarah', 'Parham, Peter', 'Miller, Jeffrey S']","['Cooley S', 'Parham P', 'Miller JS']","['Division of Hematology, Oncology, and Transplantation, Department of Medicine, and.', 'Masonic Cancer Center, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN; and.', 'Department of Structural Biology and.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA.', 'Division of Hematology, Oncology, and Transplantation, Department of Medicine, and.', 'Masonic Cancer Center, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN; and.']",['eng'],['P01 CA111412/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",20180122,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,PMC5863700,,,2018/01/24 06:00,2019/03/20 06:00,['2018/01/24 06:00'],"['2017/07/31 00:00 [received]', '2017/09/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/20 06:00 [medline]', '2018/01/24 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)32413-7 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2017-08-752170 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2018 Mar 8;131(10):1053-1062. doi: 10.1182/blood-2017-08-752170.

However, few inroads have been made into the treatment or prevention of relapse of the underlying malignancy for which allo-HCT is being performed. The introduction of US Food and Drug Administration-approved agents with significant activity in a variety of hematologic malignancies provides an opportunity to evaluate these interventions in the allo-HCT setting. Some of the most promising new agents include tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) directed at bcr-abl, kinase inhibitors targeting fms-like tyrosine kinase 3, and immune checkpoint inhibitors blocking both CTLA4 and PD-1. Data have emerged indicating potential efficacy of these agents in preventing or treating relapse, though definitive evidence remains elusive. However, potential toxicity can be considerable, highlighting the need for further clinical trials to define the therapeutic window. This review explores the immunologic and clinical consequence of treatment with both TKIs and checkpoint inhibitors in the peri- and post-allo-HCT setting.","['Soiffer, Robert J', 'Davids, Matthew S', 'Chen, Yi-Bin']","['Soiffer RJ', 'Davids MS', 'Chen YB']","['Department of Hematologic Malignancies, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', ""Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA."", 'Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA; and.', 'Department of Hematologic Malignancies, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', ""Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA."", 'Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA; and.', 'Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA; and.', 'Blood and Marrow Transplant Program, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20180122,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,,,2018/01/24 06:00,2019/03/20 06:00,['2018/01/24 06:00'],"['2017/10/15 00:00 [received]', '2018/01/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/20 06:00 [medline]', '2018/01/24 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)32415-0 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2017-10-752154 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2018 Mar 8;131(10):1073-1080. doi: 10.1182/blood-2017-10-752154.

Successful HCT can restore functional hematopoiesis and immune function, and the new donor-derived immune system can exert a graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect. However, allogenic HCT can also be associated with serious risks for transplantation-related morbidities or mortalities such as graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) or life-threatening infectious complications. GVHD is caused by alloreactive T lymphocytes, which express the alphabeta T-cell receptor, whereas lymphocytes expressing the gammadelta T-cell receptor are not alloreactive and do not induce GVHD but can exhibit potent antileukemia and anti-infectious activities. Therefore, gammadelta T cells are becoming increasingly interesting in allogeneic HCT, and clinical strategies to exploit the full function of these lymphocytes have been and are being developed. Such strategies comprise the in vivo activation of gammadelta T cells or subsets after HCT by certain drugs or antibodies or the ex vivo expansion and manipulation of either patient-derived or donor-derived gammadelta T cells and their subsets and the adoptive transfer of the ex vivo-activated lymphocytes. On the basis of the absence of dysregulated alloreactivity, such approaches could induce potent GVL effects in the absence of GVHD. The introduction of large-scale clinical methods to enrich, isolate, expand, and manipulate gammadelta T cells will facilitate future clinical studies that aim to exploit the full function of these beneficial nonalloreactive lymphocytes.","['Handgretinger, Rupert', 'Schilbach, Karin']","['Handgretinger R', 'Schilbach K']","[""Department of Hematology/Oncology, Children's University Hospital, Tuebingen, Germany."", ""Department of Hematology/Oncology, Children's University Hospital, Tuebingen, Germany.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20180122,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,,,2018/01/24 06:00,2019/03/20 06:00,['2018/01/24 06:00'],"['2017/08/03 00:00 [received]', '2017/10/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/20 06:00 [medline]', '2018/01/24 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)32414-9 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2017-08-752162 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2018 Mar 8;131(10):1063-1072. doi: 10.1182/blood-2017-08-752162.

However, efficient strategies for generating large-scale functional blood cells from hPSCs are still lacking, and the mechanism underlying human hematopoiesis remains largely unknown. In this study, we identified myeloid ectopic viral integration site 1 homolog (MEIS1) as a crucial regulator of hPSC early hematopoietic differentiation. MEIS1 is vital for specification of APLNR(+) mesoderm progenitors to functional hemogenic endothelial progenitors (HEPs), thereby controlling formation of hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs). TAL1 mediates the function of MEIS1 in HEP specification. In addition, MEIS1 is vital for megakaryopoiesis and thrombopoiesis from hPSCs. Mechanistically, FLI1 acts as a downstream gene necessary for the function of MEIS1 during megakaryopoiesis. Thus, MEIS1 controls human hematopoiesis in a stage-specific manner and can be potentially manipulated for large-scale generation of HPCs or platelets from hPSCs for therapeutic applications in regenerative medicine.","['Wang, Hongtao', 'Liu, Cuicui', 'Liu, Xin', 'Wang, Mengge', 'Wu, Dan', 'Gao, Jie', 'Su, Pei', 'Nakahata, Tatsutoshi', 'Zhou, Wen', 'Xu, Yuanfu', 'Shi, Lihong', 'Ma, Feng', 'Zhou, Jiaxi']","['Wang H', 'Liu C', 'Liu X', 'Wang M', 'Wu D', 'Gao J', 'Su P', 'Nakahata T', 'Zhou W', 'Xu Y', 'Shi L', 'Ma F', 'Zhou J']","['State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Tianjin 300020, China; Center for Stem Cell Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Department of Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine, Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Tianjin 300020, China; Center for Stem Cell Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Department of Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine, Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Tianjin 300020, China; Center for Stem Cell Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Department of Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine, Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Tianjin 300020, China; Center for Stem Cell Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Department of Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine, Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Tianjin 300020, China; Center for Stem Cell Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Department of Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine, Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Tianjin 300020, China; Center for Stem Cell Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Department of Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine, Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Tianjin 300020, China; Center for Stem Cell Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Department of Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine, Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'Center for iPS Cell Research and Application (CiRA), Kyoto University, Kyoto 606-8507, Japan.', 'School of Basic Medical Science and Cancer Research Institute, Central South University, Changsha 410013, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Tianjin 300020, China; Center for Stem Cell Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Department of Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine, Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Tianjin 300020, China; Center for Stem Cell Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Department of Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine, Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Tianjin 300020, China; Institute of Blood Transfusion, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Chengdu 610052, China.

Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) protect leukemic cells from chemotherapy, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. In this study, we aimed to uncover the mechanism of MSC-induced chemoresistance in T-ALL cells, thus providing a promising clinical therapy target. METHODS: Cell viability was determined using the viability assay kit CCK-8. The mitochondrial ROS levels were detected using the fluorescent probe MitoSOX Red, and fluorescence intensity was measured by flow cytometry. In vitro, MSCs and Jurkat cells were cocultured. MSCs were labeled with green fluorescent protein (GFP), and Jurkat cells were labeled with the mitochondria-specific dye MitoTracker Red. Bidirectional mitochondrial transfer was detected by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy. The mechanism of mitochondria transfer was analyzed by inhibitor assays. Transcripts related to Jurkat cell/MSC adhesion in the coculture system were assessed by qRT-PCR. After treatment with a neutralizing antibody against a key adhesion molecule, mitochondria transfer from Jurkat cells to MSCs was again detected by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy. Finally, we verified our findings using human primary T-ALL cells cocultured with MSCs. RESULTS: Chemotherapeutic drugs caused intracellular oxidative stress in Jurkat cells. Jurkat cells transfer mitochondria to MSCs but receive few mitochondria from MSCs, resulting in chemoresistance. This process of mitochondria transfer is mediated by tunneling nanotubes, which are protrusions that extend from the cell membrane . Moreover, we found that most Jurkat cells adhered to MSCs in the coculture system, which was mediated by the adhesion molecule ICAM-1. Treatment with a neutralizing antibody against ICAM-1 led to a decreased number of adhering Jurkat cells, decreased mitochondria transfer, and increased chemotherapy-induced cell death. CONCLUSIONS: We show evidence that mitochondria transfer from Jurkat cells to MSCs, which is mediated by cell adhesion, may be a potential therapeutic target for T-ALL treatment.","['Wang, Jiancheng',

Here, we describe the role of EPS8 in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and consider the potential of EPS8 as an anti-AML target. Nuclear localization signal (NLS) residues of tumor-associated proteins are crucial for cell cycle progression, and specific inhibitors derived from the NLS have inhibitory effect on cancer cells. The NLS in EPS8 has potential as a specific anti-AML target. METHODS: Gene Expression Omnibus expression profiles of AML patients were used to test associations between EPS8 expression and AML patient outcome. The biological characteristics of AML cells after EPS8 knockdown were analyzed in vitro and in vivo. A specific peptide (CP-EPS8-NLS) derived from the NLS of EPS8 (amino acids 298-310) was synthesized, and the anti-AML effects of CP-EPS8-NLS were analyzed in cancer cells and in xenograft models. Mutated CP-EPS8-NLS and penetratin served as controls. RESULTS: We observed that elevated EPS8 expression in AML patients is associated with poor outcome. Knockdown of EPS8 significantly suppressed the survival of AML cells in vitro and in vivo. CP-EPS8-NLS interfered with EPS8-associated signaling and consequently exerted anti-AML activity. Importantly, CP-EPS8-NLS displayed anti-AML activity in various AML cell types, with diminished activity in PBMCs. CP-ESP8-NLS suppressed U937 cell proliferation, and injection of CP-EPS8-NLS exerted potent antitumor activity in the xenograft tumor models. A synergistic effect of CP-EPS8-NLS and chemotherapeutic agents was also observed in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, treatment of various AML cells with CP-EPS8-NLS downregulated the expression of EPS8 and its downstream pathways. CONCLUSIONS: The function of CP-EPS8-NLS is explained by the presence of a NLS in EPS8, which has been shown to induce nuclear translocation, consequently resulting in EPS8 overexpression. These results indicate that EPS8 is a potential target for AML treatment.","['Chen, Yiran', 'Xie, Xiaoling', 'Wu, Anqin', 'Wang, Lei', 'Hu, Yuxing', 'Zhang, Honghao', 'Li, Yuhua']","['Chen Y', 'Xie X', 'Wu A', 'Wang L', 'Hu Y', 'Zhang H', 'Li Y']","[""Department of Hematology, Zhujiang Hospital, Southern Medical University, No. 253 GongyeDadaoZhong, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510282, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Zhujiang Hospital, Southern Medical University, No. 253 GongyeDadaoZhong, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510282, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Zhujiang Hospital, Southern Medical University, No. 253 GongyeDadaoZhong, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510282, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Zhujiang Hospital, Southern Medical University, No. 253 GongyeDadaoZhong, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510282, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Zhujiang Hospital, Southern Medical University, No. 253 GongyeDadaoZhong, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510282, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Zhujiang Hospital, Southern Medical University, No. 253 GongyeDadaoZhong, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510282, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Zhujiang Hospital, Southern Medical University, No. 253 GongyeDadaoZhong, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510282, People's Republic of China. liyuhua1974@outlook.com.""]",['eng'],"['81377249/National Natural Science Foundation of China', '2016020213005/Science and Technology Planning Project of Guangdong Province,', 'China']",['Journal Article'],20180122,England,J Exp Clin Cancer Res,Journal of experimental & clinical cancer research : CR,8308647,PMC5778704,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Epidermal growth factor receptor pathway substrate no.8 (EPS8)', 'Nuclear localization signal', 'Peptide']",2018/01/24 06:00,2019/05/10 06:00,['2018/01/24 06:00'],"['2017/09/26 00:00 [received]', '2018/01/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/01/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/10 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13046-018-0682-x [doi]', '10.1186/s13046-018-0682-x [pii]']",epublish,J Exp Clin Cancer Res. 2018 Jan 22;37(1):12. doi: 10.1186/s13046-018-0682-x.,20190509,1,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cell-Penetrating Peptides)', '0 (EPS8 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Localization Signals)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/*chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemical synthesis/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell-Penetrating Peptides/chemical synthesis/*pharmacology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Drug Synergism', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Nuclear Localization Signals/*chemistry', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Transcriptome', 'Tumor Burden/drug effects', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
29357872,NLM,MEDLINE,20211214,1742-4690 (Electronic) 1742-4690 (Linking),15,2018 Jan 22,Ribosome profiling of the retrovirus murine leukemia virus.,10,10.1186/s12977-018-0394-5 [doi],"BACKGROUND: The retrovirus murine leukemia virus (MuLV) has an 8.3 kb RNA genome with a simple 5'-gag-pol-env-3' architecture. Translation of the pol gene is dependent upon readthrough of the gag UAG stop codon; whereas the env gene is translated from spliced mRNA transcripts. Here, we report the first high resolution analysis of retrovirus gene expression through tandem ribosome profiling (RiboSeq) and RNA sequencing (RNASeq) of MuLV-infected cells. RESULTS: Ribosome profiling of MuLV-infected cells was performed, using the translational inhibitors harringtonine and cycloheximide to distinguish initiating and elongating ribosomes, respectively. Meta-analyses of host cell gene expression demonstrated that the RiboSeq datasets specifically captured the footprints of translating ribosomes at high resolution. Direct measurement of ribosomal occupancy of the MuLV genomic RNA indicated that ~ 7% of ribosomes undergo gag stop codon readthrough to access the pol gene. Initiation of translation was found to occur at several additional sites within the 5' leaders of the gag and env transcripts, upstream of their respective annotated start codons. CONCLUSIONS: These experiments reveal the existence of a number of previously uncharacterised, ribosomally occupied open reading frames within the MuLV genome, with possible regulatory consequences. In addition, we provide the first direct measurements of stop codon readthrough efficiency during cellular infection.","['Irigoyen, Nerea', 'Dinan, Adam M', 'Brierley, Ian', 'Firth, Andrew E']","['Irigoyen N', 'Dinan AM', 'Brierley I', 'Firth AE']","['Division of Virology, Department of Pathology, University of Cambridge, Tennis Court Rd, Cambridge, CB2 1QP, UK.', 'Division of Virology, Department of Pathology, University of Cambridge, Tennis Court Rd, Cambridge, CB2 1QP, UK.', 'Division of Virology, Department of Pathology, University of Cambridge, Tennis Court Rd, Cambridge, CB2 1QP, UK.', 'Division of Virology, Department of Pathology, University of Cambridge, Tennis Court Rd, Cambridge, CB2 1QP, UK. aef24@cam.ac.uk.']",['eng'],"['646891/ERC_/European Research Council/International', '092334/Z/10/Z/Wellcome Trust (GB)/International', 'BB/G020272/1/BB_/Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council/United', 'Kingdom', 'WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', '106207/WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'MR/M011747/1/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180122,England,Retrovirology,Retrovirology,101216893,PMC5778647,['NOTNLM'],"['*Murine leukemia virus', '*RNASeq', '*Retrovirus', '*Ribosome profiling', '*Upstream ORF', '*Viral translation']",2018/01/24 06:00,2018/11/28 06:00,['2018/01/24 06:00'],"['2017/11/20 00:00 [received]', '2018/01/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/01/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/11/28 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12977-018-0394-5 [doi]', '10.1186/s12977-018-0394-5 [pii]']",epublish,Retrovirology. 2018 Jan 22;15(1):10. doi: 10.1186/s12977-018-0394-5.,20181127,1,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*methods', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Protein Biosynthesis/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Ribosomes/*metabolism', 'Sequence Analysis, RNA', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription, Genetic']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-6346-3369', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7986-9520']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, it also places considerable demands on family life. The aim of this study was to explore changes in the family functioning after a pediatric cancer diagnosis. Ten couples who had a child with leukemia or non-Hodgkin lymphoma were interviewed individually about their experiences. Interviews were semistructured, and the data were analyzed using Multi Family Member Interview Analysis. Three themes emerged from the data: (a) Family Cohesion: Strengthened Versus Fragmented; (b) Educational Norms and Values: Overindulgence Versus Being Stricter, and (c) Normality: Loss Versus Preservation. The conflicting dynamics present in these emerging themes exemplify the complexity of this process of family adaptation. This study illustrates the need to take into account the family level, as well as the conflicting feelings parents may experience after a pediatric cancer diagnosis.","['Van Schoors, Marieke', 'De Mol, Jan', 'Morren, Hanne', 'Verhofstadt, Lesley L', 'Goubert, Liesbet', 'Van Parys, Hanna']","['Van Schoors M', 'De Mol J', 'Morren H', 'Verhofstadt LL', 'Goubert L', 'Van Parys H']","['1 Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', '2 Universite Catholic de Louvain, Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium.', '3 Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium.', '1 Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', '1 Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', '1 Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', '3 Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20180122,United States,Qual Health Res,Qualitative health research,9202144,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Western Europe', '*cancer', '*children', '*families', '*illness and disease', '*interviews', '*qualitative research']",2018/01/24 06:00,2019/06/25 06:00,['2018/01/24 06:00'],"['2018/01/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/25 06:00 [medline]', '2018/01/24 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/1049732317753587 [doi]'],ppublish,Qual Health Res. 2018 Jul;28(8):1229-1241. doi: 10.1177/1049732317753587.

A structure-activity-relationship study illustrates that the incorporation of a pyrimidine-fused heterocycle at position 4 of the pyrazole is critical for FLT3 and CDK inhibition. Compound 50 (FN-1501), which possesses potent inhibitory activities against FLT3, CDK2, CDK4, and CDK6 with IC50 values in the nanomolar range, shows antiproliferative activities against MV4-11 cells (IC50: 0.008 muM), which correlates with the suppression of retinoblastoma phosphorylation, FLT3, ERK, AKT, and STAT5 and the onset of apoptosis. Acute-toxicity studies in mice show that compound 50 (LD50: 186 mg/kg) is safer than AT7519 (32 mg/kg). In MV4-11 xenografts in a nude-mouse model, compound 50 can induce tumor regression at the dose of 15 mg/kg, which is more efficient than cytarabine (50 mg/kg). Taken together, these results demonstrate the potential of this unique compound for further development into a drug applied in acute-myeloid-leukemia (AML) therapeutics.","['Wang, Yue', 'Zhi, Yanle', 'Jin, Qiaomei', 'Lu, Shuai', 'Lin, Guowu', 'Yuan, Haoliang', 'Yang, Taotao', 'Wang, Zhanwei', 'Yao, Chao', 'Ling, Jun', 'Guo, Hao', 'Li, Tonghui', 'Jin, Jianlin', 'Li, Baoquan', 'Zhang, Li', 'Chen, Yadong', 'Lu, Tao']","['Wang Y', 'Zhi Y', 'Jin Q', 'Lu S', 'Lin G', 'Yuan H', 'Yang T', 'Wang Z', 'Yao C', 'Ling J', 'Guo H', 'Li T', 'Jin J', 'Li B', 'Zhang L', 'Chen Y', 'Lu T']","['School of Sciences and double daggerState Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, China Pharmaceutical University , 24 Tongjiaxiang, Nanjing 210009, PR China.', 'School of Sciences and double daggerState Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, China Pharmaceutical University , 24 Tongjiaxiang, Nanjing 210009, PR China.', 'School of Sciences and double daggerState Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, China Pharmaceutical University , 24 Tongjiaxiang, Nanjing 210009, PR China.', 'School of Sciences and double daggerState Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, China Pharmaceutical University , 24 Tongjiaxiang, Nanjing 210009, PR China.', 'School of Sciences and double daggerState Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, China Pharmaceutical University , 24 Tongjiaxiang, Nanjing 210009, PR China.', 'School of Sciences and double daggerState Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, China Pharmaceutical University , 24 Tongjiaxiang, Nanjing 210009, PR China.', 'School of Sciences and double daggerState Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, China Pharmaceutical University , 24 Tongjiaxiang, Nanjing 210009, PR China.', 'School of Sciences and double daggerState Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, China Pharmaceutical University , 24 Tongjiaxiang, Nanjing 210009, PR China.', 'School of Sciences and double daggerState Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, China Pharmaceutical University , 24 Tongjiaxiang, Nanjing 210009, PR China.', 'School of Sciences and double daggerState Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, China Pharmaceutical University , 24 Tongjiaxiang, Nanjing 210009, PR China.', 'School of Sciences and double daggerState Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, China Pharmaceutical University , 24 Tongjiaxiang, Nanjing 210009, PR China.', 'School of Sciences and double daggerState Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, China Pharmaceutical University , 24 Tongjiaxiang, Nanjing 210009, PR China.', 'School of Sciences and double daggerState Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, China Pharmaceutical University , 24 Tongjiaxiang, Nanjing 210009, PR China.', 'School of Sciences and double daggerState Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, China Pharmaceutical University , 24 Tongjiaxiang, Nanjing 210009, PR China.', 'School of Sciences and double daggerState Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, China Pharmaceutical University , 24 Tongjiaxiang, Nanjing 210009, PR China.', 'School of Sciences and double daggerState Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, China Pharmaceutical University , 24 Tongjiaxiang, Nanjing 210009, PR China.', 'School of Sciences and double daggerState Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, China Pharmaceutical University , 24 Tongjiaxiang, Nanjing 210009, PR China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180212,United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,,,,2018/01/23 06:00,2019/04/16 06:00,['2018/01/23 06:00'],"['2018/01/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/16 06:00 [medline]', '2018/01/23 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/acs.jmedchem.7b01261 [doi]'],ppublish,J Med Chem. 2018 Feb 22;61(4):1499-1518. doi: 10.1021/acs.jmedchem.7b01261.

The interrelation of soil bacterial community structure, antibiotic resistance genes, and heavy metal contamination in soil is still unclear. Here, seven agricultural areas (G1-G7) with heavy metal contamination were sampled with different distances (741 to 2556 m) to the factory. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and Shannon index were used to analyze bacterial community diversity. Real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR was used to detect the relative abundance of ARGs sul1, sul2, tetA, tetM, tetW, one mobile genetic elements (MGE) inti1. Results showed that all samples were polluted by Cadmium (Cd), and some of them were polluted by lead (Pb), mercury (Hg), arsenic (As), copper (Cu), and zinc (Zn). DGGE showed that the most abundant bacterial species were found in G7 with the lightest heavy metal contamination. The results of the principal component analysis and clustering analysis both showed that G7 could not be classified with other samples. The relative abundance of sul1 was correlated with Cu, Zn concentration. Gene sul2 are positively related with total phosphorus, and tetM was associated with organic matter. Total gene abundances and relative abundance of inti1 both correlated with organic matter. Redundancy analysis showed that Zn and sul2 were significantly related with bacterial community structure. Together, our results indicate a complex linkage between soil heavy metal concentration, bacterial community composition, and some global disseminated ARG abundance.","['Zhang, Fengli', 'Zhao, Xiaoxue', 'Li, Qingbo', 'Liu, Jia', 'Ding, Jizhe', 'Wu, Huiying', 'Zhao, Zongsheng', 'Ba, Yue', 'Cheng, Xuemin', 'Cui, Liuxin', 'Li, Hongping', 'Zhu, Jingyuan']","['Zhang F', 'Zhao X', 'Li Q', 'Liu J', 'Ding J', 'Wu H', 'Zhao Z', 'Ba Y', 'Cheng X', 'Cui L', 'Li H', 'Zhu J']","['College of Public Health, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, 450001, China.', 'Jiyuan City Key Laboratory of Heavy-Metal Monitoring and Pollution Control, Jiyuan, 459000, China.', 'College of Public Health, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, 450001, China.', 'Department of Leukemia, Henan Cancer Hospital, Zhengzhou, 450003, China.', 'College of Public Health, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, 450001, China.', 'College of Public Health, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, 450001, China.', 'Jiyuan City Key Laboratory of Heavy-Metal Monitoring and Pollution Control, Jiyuan, 459000, China.', 'College of Public Health, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, 450001, China.', 'College of Public Health, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, 450001, China.', 'College of Public Health, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, 450001, China.', 'College of Public Health, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, 450001, China.', 'College of Public Health, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, 450001, China. yuanzhu@zzu.edu.cn.']",['eng'],['81202174/National Natural Science Youth Foundation of China'],['Journal Article'],20180122,Germany,Environ Sci Pollut Res Int,Environmental science and pollution research international,9441769,,['NOTNLM'],"['Agricultural soil', 'Antibiotic resistance genes', 'Bacterial community', 'Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis', 'Heavy metal', 'Real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR']",2018/01/23 06:00,2019/02/02 06:00,['2018/01/23 06:00'],"['2017/09/26 00:00 [received]', '2018/01/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/02/02 06:00 [medline]', '2018/01/23 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s11356-018-1251-8 [doi]', '10.1007/s11356-018-1251-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Environ Sci Pollut Res Int. 2018 Apr;25(10):9547-9555. doi: 10.1007/s11356-018-1251-8.

Involvement of the gastrointestinal tract by Aspergillus is mostly reported as part of a disseminated infection from a primary pulmonary site and only rarely as an isolated organ infection. METHODS: We report a case of small bowel perforation due to IA in a patient with acute leukemia under chemotherapy and pulmonary aspergillosis. We performed a systematic review of the literature as well. RESULTS: A 43-year-old man with acute myeloid leukemia under chemotherapy developed severe neutropenia and pulmonary aspergillosis due to Aspergillus flavus. He developed melena and hemodynamic failure and a contrast-enhanced ultrasound scan suggested active intestinal bleeding. During emergency laparotomy we found multiple intestinal abscesses, several perforations of intestinal loop and Aspergillus flavus was isolated from the abscesses. Resection of the jejunum was performed. The patient received voriconazole and finally recovered. The patient is now alive and in complete disease remission. From literature review we found 35 intestinal IA previously published in single case reports or small case series as well. CONCLUSION: Clinical manifestations of gastrointestinal aspergillosis are nonspecific, such as abdominal pain, and only occasionally it presents as an acute abdomen. Antemortem detection of bowel involvement is rarely achieved and, only in cases of complicated gastrointestinal aspergillosis, the diagnosis is achieved thanks to the findings during surgery. Gastrointestinal aspergillosis should be suspected in patients with severe and prolonged neutropenia with or without pulmonary involvement in order to consider the right therapy and prompt surgery.","['Di Franco, Gregorio', 'Tagliaferri, Enrico', 'Pieroni, Erica', 'Benedetti, Edoardo', 'Guadagni, Simone', 'Palmeri, Matteo', 'Furbetta, Niccolo', 'Campani, Daniela', 'Di Candio, Giulio', 'Petrini, Mario', 'Mosca, Franco', 'Morelli, Luca']","['Di Franco G', 'Tagliaferri E', 'Pieroni E', 'Benedetti E', 'Guadagni S', 'Palmeri M', 'Furbetta N', 'Campani D', 'Di Candio G', 'Petrini M', 'Mosca F', 'Morelli L']","['General Surgery Unit, Department of Surgery, Translational and new Technologies in Medicine, University of Pisa, Via Paradisa 2, 56125, Pisa, Italy.', 'Infectious Diseases Unit, Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Pisa, Pisa, Italy.', 'General Surgery Unit, Department of Surgery, Translational and new Technologies in Medicine, University of Pisa, Via Paradisa 2, 56125, Pisa, Italy.', 'Haematology Unit, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy.', 'General Surgery Unit, Department of Surgery, Translational and new Technologies in Medicine, University of Pisa, Via Paradisa 2, 56125, Pisa, Italy.', 'General Surgery Unit, Department of Surgery, Translational and new Technologies in Medicine, University of Pisa, Via Paradisa 2, 56125, Pisa, Italy.', 'General Surgery Unit, Department of Surgery, Translational and new Technologies in Medicine, University of Pisa, Via Paradisa 2, 56125, Pisa, Italy.', 'Division of Surgical Pathology, Department of Surgical, Medical, Molecular Pathology and Critical Area, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy.', 'General Surgery Unit, Department of Surgery, Translational and new Technologies in Medicine, University of Pisa, Via Paradisa 2, 56125, Pisa, Italy.', 'Haematology Unit, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy.', 'EndoCAS (Center for Computer Assisted Surgery), University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy.', 'General Surgery Unit, Department of Surgery, Translational and new Technologies in Medicine, University of Pisa, Via Paradisa 2, 56125, Pisa, Italy. luca.morelli@unipi.it.', 'EndoCAS (Center for Computer Assisted Surgery), University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy. luca.morelli@unipi.it.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",20180122,Germany,Infection,Infection,0365307,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Disseminated aspergillosis', 'Gastrointestinal aspergillosis', 'Small bowel perforation']",2018/01/23 06:00,2018/09/15 06:00,['2018/01/23 06:00'],"['2017/02/03 00:00 [received]', '2018/01/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/09/15 06:00 [medline]', '2018/01/23 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s15010-018-1115-7 [doi]', '10.1007/s15010-018-1115-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Infection. 2018 Jun;46(3):317-324. doi: 10.1007/s15010-018-1115-7.

Understanding the long-term outcome of patients provides a benchmark for novel treatment regimens for FL. Patients and Methods Between 2001 and 2008, 531 previously untreated patients with FL were randomly assigned to receive either six cycles of R-CHOP or six cycles of CHOP-RIT. Patients with advanced-stage disease (bulky stage II, III, or IV) of any pathologic grade (1, 2, or 3) were eligible. Results After a median follow-up of 10.3 years, 10-year estimates of progression-free and overall survival were 49% and 78% among all patients, respectively. Patients in the CHOP-RIT arm had significantly better 10-year progression-free survival compared with patients in the R-CHOP arm (56% v 42%; P = .01), but 10-year overall survival was not different between the two arms (75% v 81%; P = .13). There was no significant difference between the CHOP-RIT and R-CHOP arms in regard to incidence of second malignancies (15.1% v 16.1%; P = .81) or myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myeloid leukemia (4.9% v 1.8%; P = .058). The estimated 10-year cumulative incidences of death resulting from second malignancies were not different (7.1% v 3.2%; P = .16), but cumulative incidence of death resulting from myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myeloid leukemia was higher in the CHOP-RIT arm compared with the R-CHOP arm (4% v 0.9%; P = .02). Conclusion Given these outstanding outcomes, immunochemotherapy should remain the standard induction approach for patients with high-risk FL until long-term follow-up of alternative approaches demonstrates superiority.","['Shadman, Mazyar', 'Li, Hongli', 'Rimsza, Lisa', 'Leonard, John P', 'Kaminski, Mark S', 'Braziel, Rita M', 'Spier, Catherine M', 'Gopal, Ajay K', 'Maloney, David G', 'Cheson, Bruce D', 'Dakhil, Shaker', 'LeBlanc, Michael', 'Smith, Sonali M', 'Fisher, Richard I', 'Friedberg, Jonathan W', 'Press, Oliver W']","['Shadman M', 'Li H', 'Rimsza L', 'Leonard JP', 'Kaminski MS', 'Braziel RM', 'Spier CM', 'Gopal AK', 'Maloney DG', 'Cheson BD', 'Dakhil S', 'LeBlanc M', 'Smith SM', 'Fisher RI', 'Friedberg JW', 'Press OW']","['Mazyar Shadman, Ajay K.

This is particularly relevant for proteins depending on molecular scaffolding, such as transcription factors or receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). To address tractability of multiple RTKs for chemical degradation by the E3 ligase CUL4-RBX1-DDB1-CRBN (CRL4(CRBN)), we synthesized a series of phthalimide degraders based on the promiscuous kinase inhibitors sunitinib and PHA665752. While both series failed to induce degradation of their consensus targets, individual molecules displayed pronounced efficacy in leukemia cell lines. Orthogonal target identification supported by molecular docking led us to identify the translation termination factor G1 to S phase transition 1 (GSPT1) as a converging off-target, resulting from inadvertent E3 ligase modulation. This research highlights the importance of monitoring degradation events that are independent of the respective targeting ligand as a unique feature of small-molecule degraders.","['Ishoey, Mette', 'Chorn, Someth', 'Singh, Natesh', 'Jaeger, Martin G', 'Brand, Matthias', 'Paulk, Joshiawa', 'Bauer, Sophie', 'Erb, Michael A', 'Parapatics, Katja', 'Muller, Andre C', 'Bennett, Keiryn L', 'Ecker, Gerhard F', 'Bradner, James E', 'Winter, Georg E']","['Ishoey M', 'Chorn S', 'Singh N', 'Jaeger MG', 'Brand M', 'Paulk J', 'Bauer S', 'Erb MA', 'Parapatics K', 'Muller AC', 'Bennett KL', 'Ecker GF', 'Bradner JE', 'Winter GE']","['Department of Medical Oncology , Dana-Farber Cancer Institute , Boston , Massachusetts 02115 , United States.', 'CeMM Research Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Science , Lazarettgasse 14, AKH Bt. 25.3 , 1090 Vienna , Austria.', 'University of Vienna , Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry , Althanstrasse 14 , 1090 Vienna , Austria.', 'CeMM Research Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Science , Lazarettgasse 14, AKH Bt. 25.3 , 1090 Vienna , Austria.', 'CeMM Research Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Science , Lazarettgasse 14, AKH Bt. 25.3 , 1090 Vienna , Austria.', 'Department of Medical Oncology , Dana-Farber Cancer Institute , Boston , Massachusetts 02115 , United States.', 'Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research , Cambridge , Massachusetts 02139 , United States.', 'CeMM Research Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Science , Lazarettgasse 14, AKH Bt. 25.3 , 1090 Vienna , Austria.', 'Department of Medical Oncology , Dana-Farber Cancer Institute , Boston , Massachusetts 02115 , United States.', 'CeMM Research Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Science , Lazarettgasse 14, AKH Bt. 25.3 , 1090 Vienna , Austria.', 'CeMM Research Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Science , Lazarettgasse 14, AKH Bt. 25.3 , 1090 Vienna , Austria.', 'CeMM Research Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Science , Lazarettgasse 14, AKH Bt. 25.3 , 1090 Vienna , Austria.', 'University of Vienna , Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry , Althanstrasse 14 , 1090 Vienna , Austria.', 'Department of Medical Oncology , Dana-Farber Cancer Institute , Boston , Massachusetts 02115 , United States.', 'Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research , Cambridge , Massachusetts 02139 , United States.', 'CeMM Research Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Science , Lazarettgasse 14, AKH Bt. 25.3 , 1090 Vienna , Austria.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA176745/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA109901/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180129,United States,ACS Chem Biol,ACS chemical biology,101282906,,,,2018/01/23 06:00,2019/04/06 06:00,['2018/01/23 06:00'],"['2018/01/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/06 06:00 [medline]', '2018/01/23 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/acschembio.7b00969 [doi]'],ppublish,ACS Chem Biol. 2018 Mar 16;13(3):553-560. doi: 10.1021/acschembio.7b00969.

However, its clinical evolution, histopathological features and pathogenesis remain unclear. OBJECTIVES: To characterize this eruption and to investigate its pathogenesis and relationship with the underlying BCM. METHODS: In this multicenter retrospective study of the French Study Group on Cutaneous Lymphomas, 37 patients with a BCM and a cutaneous eruption consisting in chronic and/or recurrent papules, papulo-vesicles and/or nodules were included. Clinical, histopathological, immunohistochemical and molecular data were reviewed. RESULTS: No significant insect bite history or seasonal predominance was recorded. Patients had pruritic papules (81%), papulo-vesicles (43%) and nodules (38%), often predominated in the head and neck region (84%), without complete remission periods in most cases (57%). The predominant associated BCM was chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (73%). Histological and immunohistochemical review showed a dense dermal lymphocytic infiltrate predominantly composed of T lymphocytes (100%), with frequent eosinophils (77.6%); a perivascular and periadnexal (most often folliculotropic) pattern (77.6%), sometimes suggestive of a folliculotropic mycosis fungoides; clusters of tumour B cells were identified in 47% of cases using appropriate phenotyping markers. In 10/14 cases (71.4%) tested for B-cell IgH gene rearrangement, a B-cell clone was identified in skin lesions (identical to the blood clone in nine cases), whereas no T-cell clone was present. CONCLUSION: We propose the denomination 'T-cell papulosis associated with B-cell malignancy' (TCP-BCM) for this distinctive eruption. Although resulting in various histopathological pictures, it can be easily recognized by clinicians and may be identified by informed pathologists relying on some key features. An extravasation of tumour B cells with skin-homing properties associated with a secondary, predominant, T-cell immune reaction could explain the clinicopathologic aspect and the prolonged regressive and recurrent course of the disease.","['Visseaux, L', 'Durlach, A', 'Barete, S', 'Beylot-Barry, M', 'Bonnet, N', 'Chassine, A', 'Franck, N', 'Herve, G', ""Leclec'h, C"", 'Machet, L', 'Ingen-Housz-Oro, S', 'Petrella, T', 'Vergier, B', 'Ortonne, N', 'Grange, F']","['Visseaux L', 'Durlach A', 'Barete S', 'Beylot-Barry M', 'Bonnet N', 'Chassine A', 'Franck N', 'Herve G', ""Leclec'h C"", 'Machet L', 'Ingen-Housz-Oro S', 'Petrella T', 'Vergier B', 'Ortonne N', 'Grange F']","['Service de Dermatologie, Hopital Robert Debre, Reims, France.', 'Laboratoire Pol Bouin, Hopital Maison Blanche, Reims, France.', 'Service de Dermatologie, Hopital Pitie-Salpetriere, Paris, France.', 'Service de Dermatologie, Hopital Saint-Andre, Bordeaux, France.', 'Dermatologie, Institut Paoli Calmettes, Marseille, France.', 'Cabinet de Dermatologie, Prouzel, France.', 'Service de Dermatologie, Hopital Cochin, Paris, France.', 'Service de Pathologie, Hopital Pitie-Salpetriere, Paris, France.', ""Service de Dermatologie, CHU d'Angers, Angers, France."", 'Service de Dermatologie, Hopital Trousseau, Tours, France.', 'Service de Dermatologie, Hopital Henri Mondor, Creteil, France.', 'Department of Hematology-Oncology, University of Montreal, Montreal, Canada.', 'Service de Pathologie, Hopital Haut-Leveque, Pessac, France.', 'Service de Pathologie, Hopital Henri Mondor, Creteil, France.', 'Service de Dermatologie, Hopital Robert Debre, Reims, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20180212,England,J Eur Acad Dermatol Venereol,Journal of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology : JEADV,9216037,,,,2018/01/23 06:00,2018/12/24 06:00,['2018/01/23 06:00'],"['2017/07/11 00:00 [received]', '2018/01/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/12/24 06:00 [medline]', '2018/01/23 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/jdv.14805 [doi]'],ppublish,J Eur Acad Dermatol Venereol. 2018 Sep;32(9):1469-1475. doi: 10.1111/jdv.14805.

The numerical and graphic data both provide useful clues for suspecting a diagnosis especially when the workload is very high. AIM: We present our experience of useful information provided by graphic displays of an automated cell counter in hematological malignancies in a cancer hospital where a large number of complete blood count (CBC) requests are received either before or during chemotherapy. This study was conducted to assess the usefulness of hematology cell counter, viz. WBC-Diff (WBC differential), WBC/BASO (WBC basophil) and IMI (immature myeloid information) channel scatter plots, and the flaggings generated in various hematological malignancies. MATERIAL & METHODS: The graphic displays have been compiled over a period of 1 year (October 2015-September 2016) from blood samples of various solid and hematological malignancies (approximately 400 per day) received for routine CBC in the laboratory. Approximately 50 000 scattergrams have been analyzed during the study period. The findings were confirmed by peripheral blood smear examination. RESULTS: The scattergram analysis on XE-2100 is very sensitive as well as specific for diagnosing acute leukemia, viz. acute myeloid leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia; chronic myeloproliferative disorders, viz. chronic myeloid leukemia; and chronic lymphoproliferative disorder especially chronic lymphocytic leukemia. CONCLUSION: It is suggested that the laboratories using the hematology analyzers be aware of graphic display patterns in addition to flaggings generated which provide additional information and give clue toward the diagnosis even before peripheral smear examination.","['Gupta, Monica', 'Chauhan, Kriti', 'Singhvi, Tanvi', 'Kumari, Manisha', 'Grover, Rajesh Kumar']","['Gupta M', 'Chauhan K', 'Singhvi T', 'Kumari M', 'Grover RK']","['Department of Oncopathology, Delhi State Cancer Institute, Delhi, India.', 'Department of Oncopathology, Delhi State Cancer Institute, Delhi, India.', 'Department of Oncopathology, Delhi State Cancer Institute, Delhi, India.', 'Department of Oncopathology, Delhi State Cancer Institute, Delhi, India.', 'Delhi State Cancer Institute, Delhi, India.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20180121,United States,J Clin Lab Anal,Journal of clinical laboratory analysis,8801384,PMC6816877,['NOTNLM'],"['WBC-Diff scattergram', 'automated cell counter', 'hematological malignancies', 'immature myeloid information scattergram']",2018/01/23 06:00,2018/10/10 06:00,['2018/01/23 06:00'],"['2017/07/17 00:00 [received]', '2017/12/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/10 06:00 [medline]', '2018/01/23 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcla.22392 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Lab Anal. 2018 Jun;32(5):e22392. doi: 10.1002/jcla.22392.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective analysis of medical records at a UK referral hospital. Cats were grouped by mechanism of thrombocytopenia and disease process (where known). RESULTS: Prevalence of thrombocytopenia was 5.9%. The most common disease processes associated with thrombocytopenia were haematological or infectious disease and neoplasia; 11% of thrombocytopenic cats tested were positive for feline leukaemia virus, which is lower than reported previously. Cats presenting with unexplained haemorrhage had significantly lower platelet counts than other thrombocytopenic cats. Primary immune-mediated thrombocytopenia was less commonly diagnosed than in dogs and associated with the most severe platelet depletion in this study. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Thrombocytopenia in cats may be more prevalent than previously reported and severe thrombocytopenia may be associated with spontaneous haemorrhage. Severe thrombocytopenia in cats appears less commonly immune-mediated than in dogs. Thrombocytopenia did not appear to be associated with retroviral infections.","['Ellis, J', 'Bell, R', 'Barnes, D C', 'Miller, R']","['Ellis J', 'Bell R', 'Barnes DC', 'Miller R']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Dick White Referrals, Cambridgeshire CB8 0UH, UK.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Wear Referrals, Stockton-on-Tees TS21 2ES, UK.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Dick White Referrals, Cambridgeshire CB8 0UH, UK.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Dick White Referrals, Cambridgeshire CB8 0UH, UK.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20180122,England,J Small Anim Pract,The Journal of small animal practice,0165053,,,,2018/01/23 06:00,2019/09/21 06:00,['2018/01/23 06:00'],"['2017/10/09 00:00 [received]', '2017/11/27 00:00 [revised]', '2017/12/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/21 06:00 [medline]', '2018/01/23 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/jsap.12814 [doi]'],ppublish,J Small Anim Pract. 2018 Sep;59(9):531-538. doi: 10.1111/jsap.12814.

Here, we showed that combined expression of Jak2V617F and mutant IDH1R132H or Idh2R140Q induces MPN progression, alters stem/progenitor cell function, and impairs differentiation in mice. Jak2V617F Idh2R140Q-mutant MPNs were sensitive to small-molecule inhibition of IDH. Combined inhibition of JAK2 and IDH2 normalized the stem and progenitor cell compartments in the murine model and reduced disease burden to a greater extent than was seen with JAK inhibition alone. In addition, combined JAK2 and IDH2 inhibitor treatment also reversed aberrant gene expression in MPN stem cells and reversed the metabolite perturbations induced by concurrent JAK2 and IDH2 mutations. Combined JAK2 and IDH2 inhibitor therapy also showed cooperative efficacy in cells from MPN patients with both JAK2mut and IDH2mut mutations. Taken together, these data suggest that combined JAK and IDH inhibition may offer a therapeutic advantage in this high-risk MPN subtype.","['McKenney, Anna Sophia', 'Lau, Allison N', 'Somasundara, Amritha Varshini Hanasoge', 'Spitzer, Barbara', 'Intlekofer, Andrew M', 'Ahn, Jihae', 'Shank, Kaitlyn', 'Rapaport, Franck T', 'Patel, Minal A', 'Papalexi, Efthymia', 'Shih, Alan H', 'Chiu, April', 'Freinkman, Elizaveta', 'Akbay, Esra A', 'Steadman, Mya', 'Nagaraja, Raj', 'Yen, Katharine', 'Teruya-Feldstein, Julie', 'Wong, Kwok-Kin', 'Rampal, Raajit', 'Vander Heiden, Matthew G', 'Thompson, Craig B', 'Levine, Ross L']","['McKenney AS', 'Lau AN', 'Somasundara AVH', 'Spitzer B', 'Intlekofer AM', 'Ahn J', 'Shank K', 'Rapaport FT', 'Patel MA', 'Papalexi E', 'Shih AH', 'Chiu A', 'Freinkman E', 'Akbay EA', 'Steadman M', 'Nagaraja R', 'Yen K', 'Teruya-Feldstein J', 'Wong KK', 'Rampal R', 'Vander Heiden MG', 'Thompson CB', 'Levine RL']","['Weill Cornell/Rockefeller/Sloan Kettering Tri-Institutional MD-PhD Program, New York, New York, USA.', 'Gerstner Sloan Kettering Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, and.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.', 'Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research and Department of Biology, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.', 'Lymphoma Service.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.', 'Center for Hematologic Malignancies.', 'Center for Hematologic Malignancies.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.', 'Leukemia Service, Department of Medicine, and.', 'Department of Pathology, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.', 'Whitehead Institute, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Agios Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Agios Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Agios Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.', 'Leukemia Service, Department of Medicine, and.', 'Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research and Department of Biology, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Cancer Biology and Genetics Program, and.', 'Center for Epigenetics Research, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.', 'Center for Hematologic Malignancies.', 'Leukemia Service, Department of Medicine, and.', 'Center for Epigenetics Research, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.']",['eng'],"['U54 OD020355/OD/NIH HHS/United States', 'HHMI/Howard Hughes Medical Institute/United States', 'P30 CA014051/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R35 CA197594/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA165962/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'F30 CA183497/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K08 CA181507/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM007739/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180122,United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,PMC5785272,['NOTNLM'],"['*Drug therapy', '*Hematology', '*Leukemias', '*Oncology']",2018/01/23 06:00,2019/07/16 06:00,['2018/01/23 06:00'],"['2017/04/11 00:00 [received]', '2017/11/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/16 06:00 [medline]', '2018/01/23 06:00 [entrez]']","['94516 [pii]', '10.1172/JCI94516 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 2018 Feb 1;128(2):789-804. doi: 10.1172/JCI94516.

The role of and the relationship between endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and mitochondrial dysfunction was investigated in nilotinib-induced cardiac H9C2 injury as a suitable cell model. Our results showed that ER stress was persistently induced in nilotinib-treated cells, evidenced by increase of GRP78, CHOP, ATF4 and XBP1 as well as phospho-PERK(Thr980). The results from 4-phenylbutyrate (PBA, an ER stress inhibitor) and SC79 (a specific Akt activator) suggested that ER stress increased activity of glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK3beta) that is reflected by decrease of phospho-GSK3beta(Ser9), through downregulation of phospho-Akt(Ser473), and that prolonged ER stress and activated GSK3beta involved nilotinib-induced apoptosis. In addition, the data from JNK inhibition using SP600125 showed that over-activated JNK was responsible for Akt de-phosphorylation. Moreover, the abundance of NADPH oxidase (Nox4) was significantly increased following nilotinib treatment, which was prevented by SB216763 (a specific GSK3beta inhibitor). Additionally, mitochondrial dysfunction was indicated by reduced mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) level and increased reactive oxygen species level. In nilotinib-treated cells, knockdown of Nox4 preserved MMP level, abrogated reactive oxygen species production, and decreased apoptosis. Accordingly, our data demonstrated that inhibition of ER stress may protect cardiomyocytes against nilotinib toxicity potentially through inactivation of Akt-GSK3beta-Nox4 signaling. These findings may provide an attractive therapeutic target for treatment of nilotinib-related cardiotoxicity.","['Yang, Qinghui', 'Wen, Liang', 'Meng, Zenghui', 'Chen, Yanjun']","['Yang Q', 'Wen L', 'Meng Z', 'Chen Y']","['Department of Cardiology, The Fourth Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.

Mutations in NF1 are linked to neurofibromatosis type 1, juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia and Watson syndrome. In terms of antitumor immunity, CD1d-dependent natural killer T (NKT) cells play an important role in the innate antitumor immune response. Generally, Type-I NKT cells protect (and Type-II NKT cells impair) host antitumor immunity. We have previously shown that CD1d-mediated antigen presentation to NKT cells is regulated by cell signaling pathways. To study whether a haploinsufficiency in NF1 would affect CD1d-dependent activation of NKT cells, we analyzed the NKT-cell population as well as the functional expression of CD1d in Nf1(+/-) mice. Nf1(+/-) mice were found to have similar levels of NKT cells as wildtype (WT) littermates. Interestingly, however, reduced CD1d expression was observed in Nf1(+/-) mice compared with their WT littermates. When inoculated with a T-cell lymphoma in vivo, Nf1(+/-) mice survived longer than their WT littermates. Furthermore, blocking CD1d in vivo significantly enhanced antitumor activity in WT, but not in Nf1(+/-) mice. In contrast, a deficiency in Type-I NKT cells increased antitumor activity in Nf1(+/-) mice, but not in WT littermates. Therefore, these data suggest that normal NF1 expression impairs CD1d-mediated NKT-cell activation and antitumor activity against a T-cell lymphoma.","['Liu, Jianyun', 'Gallo, Richard M', 'Khan, Masood A', 'Renukaradhya, Gourapura J', 'Brutkiewicz, Randy R']","['Liu J', 'Gallo RM', 'Khan MA', 'Renukaradhya GJ', 'Brutkiewicz RR']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN, United States.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN, United States.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN, United States.', 'College of Applied Medical Sciences, Al-Qassim University, Buraidah, Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN, United States.', 'Food Animal Health Research Program (FAHRP), Ohio Agricultural Research and Development Center (OARDC), Department of Veterinary Preventive Medicine, The Ohio State University, Wooster, OH, United States.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN, United States.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20180105,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,PMC5760513,['NOTNLM'],"['CD1d', 'T-cell lymphoma', 'antitumor immunity', 'natural killer T cells', 'neurofibromin 1']",2018/01/23 06:00,2018/01/23 06:01,['2018/01/23 06:00'],"['2017/08/30 00:00 [received]', '2017/12/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/01/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/23 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2017.01901 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2018 Jan 5;8:1901. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2017.01901. eCollection 2017.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The EC Key was originally designed for dairy cattle and is not necessarily suitable for Japanese Black (JB) beef cattle. This study revealed the lymphocyte counts in the BLV-free and -infected JB cattle were significantly lower than those in the Holstein cattle. Therefore, applying the EC Key to JB cattle could result in a large number of undetected BLV-infected cattle. Our proposed hematological key, which was designed for JB cattle, improves the detection of BLV-infected cattle by approximately 20%.

Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMMSCs) and the cytokines they produce including IL-6 are important components of the TME in CLL. We found BMMSCs supported the survival of CLL cells in vitro through an IL-6 dependent mechanism. IL-17 which induces IL-6 generation in a variety of cells increased production of IL-6 both in CLL cells and BMMSCs in vitro. In a xenograft CLL mouse model, BMMSCs and the culture supernatant of BMMSCs increased engraftment of CLL cells through an IL-6 mediated mechanism with human recombinant IL-6 showing similar effects in vivo. Human recombinant IL-17 treatment also increased CLL engraftment in mice through an IL-6 mediated mechanism. Plasma of CLL patients showed elevated levels of both IL-6 and IL-17 by ELISA compared with healthy controls, with levels of IL-6 linearly correlated with IL-17 levels. CLL patients requiring fludarabine based chemotherapy expressed higher levels of IL-6 and IL-17, while CLL patients with the lowest levels of IgA/IgM had higher levels of IL-6, but not IL-17. These data imply an important role for the IL-17/IL-6 axis in CLL which could be therapeutic targets.","['Zhu, Fang', 'McCaw, Lindsay', 'Spaner, David E', 'Gorczynski, Reginald M']","['Zhu F', 'McCaw L', 'Spaner DE', 'Gorczynski RM']","['Institute of Medical Science, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada; Transplant Research Division, Toronto General Hospital, Toronto, Canada.', 'Biology Platform, Sunnybrook Research Institute, Toronto, Canada.', 'Biology Platform, Sunnybrook Research Institute, Toronto, Canada; Dept. of Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada; Dept. of Immunology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.', 'Institute of Medical Science, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada; Transplant Research Division, Toronto General Hospital, Toronto, Canada; Dept. of Immunology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.

This article is devoted to study interactions between new carbosilane-based metallodendrimers containing ruthenium and anti-cancer small interfering RNA (siRNA). Formation of complexes between anti-cancer siRNAs and Ru-based carbosilane dendrimers was evaluated by transmission electron microscopy, circular dichroism and fluorescence. The zeta-potential and the size of dendriplexes were determined by dynamic light scattering. The internalization of dendriplexes were estimated using HL-60 cells. Results show that ruthenium dendrimers associated with anticancer siRNA have the ability to deliver siRNA as non-viral vectors into the cancer cells. Moreover, dendrimers can protect siRNA against nuclease degradation. Nevertheless, further research need to be performed to examine the therapeutic potential of ruthenium dendrimers as well as dendrimers complexed with siRNA and anticancer drugs towards cancer cells.","['Michlewska, Sylwia', 'Ionov, Maksim', 'Maroto-Diaz, Marta', 'Szwed, Aleksandra', 'Ihnatsyeu-Kachan, Aliaksei', 'Loznikova, Svetlana', 'Shcharbin, Dzmitry', 'Maly, Marek', 'Ramirez, Rafael Gomez', 'de la Mata, Francisco Javier', 'Bryszewska, Maria']","['Michlewska S', 'Ionov M', 'Maroto-Diaz M', 'Szwed A', 'Ihnatsyeu-Kachan A', 'Loznikova S', 'Shcharbin D', 'Maly M', 'Ramirez RG', 'de la Mata FJ', 'Bryszewska M']","['Laboratory of Microscopic Imaging and Specialized Biological Techniques, Faculty of Biology and Environmental Protection, University of Lodz, Banacha12/16, 90-237 Lodz, Poland; Department of General Biophysics, University of Lodz, Pomorska 141/143, 90-236 Lodz, Poland.', 'Department of General Biophysics, University of Lodz, Pomorska 141/143, 90-236 Lodz, Poland.

Specific abnormalities, such as del(17p), del(11q), and unmutated IgHV, can predict the depth and durability of the response to CLL therapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In the present analysis of the Connect CLL Registry (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier, NCT01081015), a prospective observational cohort study of patients treated across 199 centers, the patterns of prognostic testing and outcomes of patients with unfavorable-risk genetics were analyzed. From 2010 to 2014, 1494 treated patients were enrolled in the registry by line of therapy (LOT), and stratified by the results of cytogenetic/fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) testing into 3 risk levels: unfavorable (presence of del[17p] or del[11q]), favorable (absence of del[17p] and del[11q]), and unknown. RESULTS: Cytogenetic/FISH testing was performed in 861 patients (58%) at enrollment; only 40% of these patients were retested before starting a subsequent LOT. Of those enrolled at the first LOT, unfavorable-risk patients had inferior event-free survival compared with favorable-risk patients (hazard ratio, 1.60; P = .001). Event-free survival was inferior with bendamustine-containing regimens (P < .0001). Event-free survival did not differ significantly between risk groups for patients treated with ibrutinib or idelalisib in the relapse/refractory setting. The predictors of reduced event-free survival included unfavorable-risk genetics, age >/= 75 years, race, and treatment choice at enrollment. CONCLUSION: The present study has shown that prognostic cytogenetic/FISH testing is infrequently performed and that patients with unfavorable-risk genetics treated with immunochemotherapy combinations have worse outcomes. This underscores the importance of performing prognostic genetic testing for all CLL patients to guide treatment.","['Mato, Anthony', 'Nabhan, Chadi', 'Kay, Neil E', 'Lamanna, Nicole', 'Kipps, Thomas J', 'Grinblatt, David L', 'Flowers, Christopher R', 'Farber, Charles M', 'Davids, Matthew S', 'Kiselev, Pavel', 'Swern, Arlene S', 'Bhushan, Shriya', 'Sullivan, Kristen', 'Flick, E Dawn', 'Sharman, Jeff P']","['Mato A', 'Nabhan C', 'Kay NE', 'Lamanna N', 'Kipps TJ', 'Grinblatt DL', 'Flowers CR', 'Farber CM', 'Davids MS', 'Kiselev P', 'Swern AS', 'Bhushan S', 'Sullivan K', 'Flick ED', 'Sharman JP']","['Center for CLL, Abramson Cancer Center, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA.

We aimed to assess the activity and safety of inotuzumab ozogamicin in combination with low-intensity chemotherapy in older patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. METHODS: We did a single-arm, phase 2 study at the MD Anderson Cancer Center (Houston, TX, USA). Eligible patients were aged 60 years or older and had newly diagnosed, Philadelphia chromosome-negative, acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 3 or lower. The induction chemotherapy regimen used was mini-hyper-CVD (a lower intensity version of the conventional hyper-CVAD). Odd-numbered cycles (1,3, 5, and 7) comprised intravenous cyclophosphamide (150 mg/m(2) every 12 h on days 1-3) and oral or intravenous dexamethasone (20 mg per day on days 1-4 and days 11-14); no anthracycline was administered. Intravenous vincristine (2 mg flat dose) was given on days 1 and 8. Even-numbered cycles comprised intravenous methotrexate (250 mg/m(2) on day 1) and intravenous cytarabine (0.5 g/m(2) given every 12 h on days 2 and 3). Intravenous inotuzumab ozogamicin was given on day 3 of the first four cycles at the dose of 1.3-1.8 mg/m(2) at cycle 1, followed by 1.0 -1.3 mg/m(2) in subsequent cycles. Maintenance therapy with dose-reduced POMP (purinethol [6-mercaptopurine], oncovin [vincristine sulfate], methotrexate, and prednisone) was given for 3 years. The primary endpoint of this study was progression-free survival at 2 years. Analyses were by intention to treat. The study is ongoing, recruiting patients for an approved expansion phase with a modified treatment plan by protocol amendment. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01371630. FINDINGS: Between Nov 12, 2011, and April 22, 2017, 52 patients with a median age of 68 years (IQR 64-72) were enrolled. With a median follow-up of 29 months (IQR 13-48), 2-year progression-free survival was 59% (95% CI 43-72). The most frequent grade 3-4 adverse events were prolonged thrombocytopenia (42 [81%] patients), infections during induction (27 [52%]) and consolidation chemotherapy (36 [69%]), hyperglycaemia (28 [54%]), hypokalaemia (16 [31%]), increased aminotransferases (ten [19%]), hyperbilirubinaemia (nine [17%]), and haemorrhage (seven [15%]). Veno-occlusive disease occurred in four (8%) patients. Six (12%) patients died from adverse events that were deemed treatment related (five [10%] from sepsis and one [2%] from veno-occlusive disease). INTERPRETATION: Inotuzumab ozogamicin plus mini-hyper-CVD chemotherapy is a safe and active first-line therapy option in older patients with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and could represent a new therapy for this population. Randomised, phase 3 trials to evaluate the efficacy of this combination compared with the current standard of care in this setting, combination chemotherapy without inotuzumab ozogamicin, are warranted.

Besides characteristic chromosomal translocations, frequent mutations affect the ATM gene, JAK/STAT pathway members, and epigenetic regulators. We here performed a targeted mutation analysis for 40 genes selected from a RNA sequencing of 10 T-PLL in a collection of 28 T-PLL, and an exome analysis of five further cases. Nonsynonymous mutations were identified in 30 of the 40 genes, 18 being recurrently mutated. We identified recurrently mutated genes previously unknown to be mutated in T-PLL, which are SAMHD1, HERC1, HERC2, PRDM2, PARP10, PTPRC, and FOXP1. SAMHD1 regulates cellular deoxynucleotide levels and acts as a potential tumor suppressor in other leukemias. We observed destructive mutations in 18% of cases as well as deletions in two further cases. Taken together, we identified additional genes involved in JAK/STAT signaling (PTPRC), epigenetic regulation (PRDM2), or DNA damage repair (SAMHD1, PARP10, HERC1, and HERC2) as being recurrently mutated in T-PLL. Thus, our study considerably extends the picture of pathways involved in molecular pathogenesis of T-PLL and identifies the tumor suppressor gene SAMHD1 with ~20% of T-PLL affected by destructive lesions likely as major player in T-PLL pathogenesis.","['Johansson, Patricia', 'Klein-Hitpass, Ludger', 'Choidas, Axel', 'Habenberger, Peter', 'Mahboubi, Bijan', 'Kim, Baek', 'Bergmann, Anke', 'Scholtysik, Rene', 'Brauser, Martina', 'Lollies, Anna', 'Siebert, Reiner', 'Zenz, Thorsten', 'Duhrsen, Ulrich', 'Kuppers, Ralf', 'Durig, Jan']","['Johansson P', 'Klein-Hitpass L', 'Choidas A', 'Habenberger P', 'Mahboubi B', 'Kim B', 'Bergmann A', 'Scholtysik R', 'Brauser M', 'Lollies A', 'Siebert R', 'Zenz T', 'Duhrsen U', 'Kuppers R', 'Durig J']","['Department of Hematology, University Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany. patricia.johansson@uk-essen.de.', 'Institute of Cell Biology (Cancer Research), University Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany. patricia.johansson@uk-essen.de.', 'Institute of Cell Biology (Cancer Research), University Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Lead Discovery Center GmbH, Dortmund, Germany.', 'Lead Discovery Center GmbH, Dortmund, Germany.', ""Center for Drug Discovery, Department of Pediatrics, Emory Center for AIDS Research, Emory University, Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Atlanta, GA, USA."", ""Center for Drug Discovery, Department of Pediatrics, Emory Center for AIDS Research, Emory University, Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Atlanta, GA, USA."", 'Institute for Human Genetics, Christian-Albrechts-University Kiel and University Hospital Schleswig Holstein, Kiel, Germany.', 'Institute of Cell Biology (Cancer Research), University Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Institute of Cell Biology (Cancer Research), University Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Institute of Cell Biology (Cancer Research), University Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Institute for Human Genetics, Christian-Albrechts-University Kiel and University Hospital Schleswig Holstein, Kiel, Germany.', 'Institute of Human Genetics, University of Ulm and University Hospital of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Molecular Therapy in Haematology and Oncology, National Center for Tumor Diseases and German Cancer Research Center, Department of Medicine V, University Hospital Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Institute of Cell Biology (Cancer Research), University Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['R01 AI049781/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM104198/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R56 AI049781/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']","['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180119,United States,Blood Cancer J,Blood cancer journal,101568469,PMC5802577,,,2018/01/21 06:00,2018/08/30 06:00,['2018/01/21 06:00'],"['2017/06/28 00:00 [received]', '2017/10/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/10/05 00:00 [revised]', '2018/01/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/01/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/08/30 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41408-017-0036-5 [doi]', '10.1038/s41408-017-0036-5 [pii]']",epublish,Blood Cancer J. 2018 Jan 19;8(1):11. doi: 10.1038/s41408-017-0036-5.,20180829,1,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', 'EC 3.1.5.- (SAM Domain and HD Domain-Containing Protein 1)', 'EC 3.1.5.- (SAMHD1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Prolymphocytic, T-Cell/enzymology/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'SAM Domain and HD Domain-Containing Protein 1/*genetics', 'Signal Transduction/*genetics']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we determined the in vivo contribution of standard CD44 and its variants to leukemic B-cell homing and proliferation in Tcl1 transgenic mice with a B-cell-specific CD44 deficiency. In these mice, leukemia onset was delayed and leukemic infiltration of spleen, liver, and lungs, but not of bone marrow, was decreased. Competitive transplantation revealed that CLL homing to spleen and bone marrow required functional CD44. Notably, enrichment of CD44v6 variants particularly in spleen enhanced CLL engraftment and proliferation, along with increased HA binding. We recapitulated CD44v6 induction in the human disease and revealed the involvement of MAPK and NF-kappaB signaling upon CD40 ligand and B-cell receptor stimulation by in vitro inhibition experiments and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. The investigation of downstream signaling after CD44v6-HA engagement uncovered the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase and p65. Consequently, anti-CD44v6 treatment reduced leukemic cell proliferation in vitro in human and mouse, confirming the general nature of the findings. In summary, we propose a CD44-NF-kappaB-CD44v6 circuit in CLL, allowing tumor cells to gain HA binding capacity and supporting their proliferation.","['Gutjahr, Julia C', 'Szenes, Eva', 'Tschech, Lisa', 'Asslaber, Daniela', 'Schlederer, Michaela', 'Roos, Simone', 'Yu, Xiaobing', 'Girbl, Tamara', 'Sternberg, Christina', 'Egle, Alexander', 'Aberger, Fritz', 'Alon, Ronen', 'Kenner, Lukas', 'Greil, Richard', 'Orian-Rousseau, Veronique', 'Hartmann, Tanja N']","['Gutjahr JC', 'Szenes E', 'Tschech L', 'Asslaber D', 'Schlederer M', 'Roos S', 'Yu X', 'Girbl T', 'Sternberg C', 'Egle A', 'Aberger F', 'Alon R', 'Kenner L', 'Greil R', 'Orian-Rousseau V', 'Hartmann TN']","['Third Medical Department with Hematology, Medical Oncology, Hemostaseology, Infectious Diseases, and Rheumatology, Oncologic Center, Paracelsus Medical University, Salzburg, Austria.', 'Cancer Cluster Salzburg, Laboratory for Immunological and Molecular Cancer Research, Salzburg Cancer Research Institute, Salzburg, Austria.', 'Third Medical Department with Hematology, Medical Oncology, Hemostaseology, Infectious Diseases, and Rheumatology, Oncologic Center, Paracelsus Medical University, Salzburg, Austria.', 'Cancer Cluster Salzburg, Laboratory for Immunological and Molecular Cancer Research, Salzburg Cancer Research Institute, Salzburg, Austria.', 'Third Medical Department with Hematology, Medical Oncology, Hemostaseology, Infectious Diseases, and Rheumatology, Oncologic Center, Paracelsus Medical University, Salzburg, Austria.', 'Cancer Cluster Salzburg, Laboratory for Immunological and Molecular Cancer Research, Salzburg Cancer Research Institute, Salzburg, Austria.', 'Third Medical Department with Hematology, Medical Oncology, Hemostaseology, Infectious Diseases, and Rheumatology, Oncologic Center, Paracelsus Medical University, Salzburg, Austria.', 'Cancer Cluster Salzburg, Laboratory for Immunological and Molecular Cancer Research, Salzburg Cancer Research Institute, Salzburg, Austria.', 'Clinical Institute of Pathology and.', 'Department of Experimental Pathology and Laboratory Animal Science, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Unit of Pathology of Laboratory Animals, University of Veterinary Medicine, Vienna, Austria.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Cancer Research, Vienna, Austria.', 'Unit of Pathology of Laboratory Animals, University of Veterinary Medicine, Vienna, Austria.', 'Institute of Toxicology and Genetics, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Karlsruhe, Germany.', 'Third Medical Department with Hematology, Medical Oncology, Hemostaseology, Infectious Diseases, and Rheumatology, Oncologic Center, Paracelsus Medical University, Salzburg, Austria.', 'Cancer Cluster Salzburg, Laboratory for Immunological and Molecular Cancer Research, Salzburg Cancer Research Institute, Salzburg, Austria.', 'Cancer Cluster Salzburg, Department of Molecular Biology, Paris-Lodron University of Salzburg, Salzburg, Austria;

Relatively small changes in gene expression can result in deregulation of this process, leading to acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), immune deficiency, or autoimmunity. Translocation of MLL1 (KMT2A) often results in a pro-B cell ALL, but little is known about its role in normal B cell differentiation. Using a Rag1-cre mouse knock-in to selectively delete Mll1 in developing lymphocytes, we show that B cell, but not T cell, homeostasis depends on MLL1. Mll1(-/-) B progenitors fail to differentiate efficiently through the pro- to pre-B cell transition, resulting in a persistent reduction in B cell populations. Cells inefficiently transit the pre-BCR checkpoint, despite normal to higher levels of pre-BCR components, and rearranged IgH expression fails to rescue this differentiation block. Instead of IgH-rearrangement defects, we find that Mll1(-/-) pre-B cells exhibit attenuated RAS/MAPK signaling downstream of the pre-BCR, which results in reduced survival in physiologic levels of IL-7. Genome-wide expression data illustrate that MLL1 is connected to B cell differentiation and IL-7-dependent survival through a complex transcriptional network. Overall, our data demonstrate that wild-type MLL1 is a regulator of pre-BCR signaling and B cell differentiation and further suggest that targeting its function in pro-B cell ALL may be more broadly effective than previously anticipated.","['Gan, Tao', 'Li, Bin E', 'Mishra, Bibhu P', 'Jones, Kenneth L', 'Ernst, Patricia']","['Gan T', 'Li BE', 'Mishra BP', 'Jones KL', 'Ernst P']","['Department of Genetics, Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, Hanover, NH 03755.', 'Department of Genetics, Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, Hanover, NH 03755.', 'Department of Genetics, Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, Hanover, NH 03755.', 'Hematology/Oncology/Bone Marrow Transplant Section, Department of Pediatrics, University of Colorado, Denver/Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO 80045; and.', 'Department of Pharmacology, University of Colorado, Denver/Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO 80045.', 'Hematology/Oncology/Bone Marrow Transplant Section, Department of Pediatrics, University of Colorado, Denver/Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO 80045; and patricia.ernst@ucdenver.edu.', 'Department of Pharmacology, University of Colorado, Denver/Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO 80045.']",['eng'],"['R01 HL090036/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 AI129426/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180119,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,PMC5909838,,,2018/01/21 06:00,2019/02/16 06:00,['2018/01/21 06:00'],"['2017/11/17 00:00 [received]', '2017/12/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/02/16 06:00 [medline]', '2018/01/21 06:00 [entrez]']","['jimmunol.1701572 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1701572 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2018 Mar 1;200(5):1682-1691. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1701572.

The metabolic profile of these patients was compared with that of controls. A total of 3203 patients from a French volunteer cohort were age- and sex-matched 3:1 to 1025 leukemia survivors (in both cohorts, mean age: 24.4 years; females: 51%). Metabolic syndrome was defined according to the National Cholesterol Education Program's Adult Treatment Panel III criteria. Metabolic syndrome was found in 10.3% of patients (mean follow-up duration: 16.3+/-0.2 years) and 4.5% of controls, (OR=2.49; P<0.001). Patients transplanted with total body irradiation presented the highest risk (OR=6.26; P<0.001); the other treatment groups also showed a higher risk than controls, including patients treated with chemotherapy only. Odd Ratios were 1.68 (P=0.005) after chemotherapy only, 2.32 (P=0.002) after chemotherapy and cranial irradiation, and 2.18 (P=0.057) in patients transplanted without irradiation. Total body irradiation recipients with metabolic syndrome displayed a unique profile compared with controls: smaller waist circumference (91 vs 99.6 cm; P=0.01), and increased triglyceride levels (3.99 vs 1.5 mmol/L; P<0.001), fasting glucose levels (6.2 vs 5.6 mmol/L; P=0.049), and systolic blood pressure (137.9 vs 132.8 mmHg; P=0.005). By contrast, cranial irradiation recipients with metabolic syndrome had a larger waist circumference (109 vs 99.6 cm; P=0.007) than controls. Regardless of the anti-leukemic treatment, metabolic syndrome risk was higher among childhood leukemia survivors. Its presentation differed depending on the treatment type, thus suggesting a divergent pathophysiology.

MSC give rise to the non-hematopoietic stromal cells of the bone marrow and are important for the maintenance of normal hematopoiesis. Chemotherapeutic drugs used for treatment of leukemia extensively damage the stromal cells and alter their gene expression profiles. METHODS: We determined the changes in adipogenic, osteogenic differentiation, phenotypic and gene expression in MSC during treatment with chemotherapeutic drugs cytarabine, daunorubicin and vincristine. We also tested anti-cancer effects of drug treated MSC on leukemia cells. RESULTS: Treatment with the chemotherapeutic drugs resulted in functional defects in MSC, leading to reduced proliferation, osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation. The drug treated MSC also showed decreased expression of cell surface receptors, and the changes in proliferation, phenotype and differentiation defect was partially reversible after withdrawing the drugs from the cells. The drug treated MSC showed increased expression of cytokines, IL6, FGF2 and TNFA but reduced levels of differentiation markers SOX9 and ACTC1. Drug treated MSC also contributed to reduced anti-cancer effects in leukemia cells. CONCLUSIONS: Chemotherapeutic drug treatment altered the phenotype, osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation potential of MSC and modified the gene expression profile of the cells to render them more chemoprotective of the leukemic cells. Thus, additional therapeutic efforts to target the stromal cell population will help in preventing chemoresistance, disease relapse in leukemia and to maintain a healthy bone marrow stroma.","['Somaiah, Chinnapaka', 'Kumar, Atul', 'Sharma, Renu', 'Sharma, Amit', 'Anand, Trishna', 'Bhattacharyya, Jina', 'Das, Damodar', 'Deka Talukdar, Sewali', 'Jaganathan, Bithiah Grace']","['Somaiah C', 'Kumar A', 'Sharma R', 'Sharma A', 'Anand T', 'Bhattacharyya J', 'Das D', 'Deka Talukdar S', 'Jaganathan BG']","['Stem Cell and Cancer Biology Group, Department of Biosciences and Bioengineering, Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati, Guwahati, India.', 'Stem Cell and Cancer Biology Group, Department of Biosciences and Bioengineering, Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati, Guwahati, India.', 'Stem Cell and Cancer Biology Group, Department of Biosciences and Bioengineering, Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati, Guwahati, India.', 'Stem Cell and Cancer Biology Group, Department of Biosciences and Bioengineering, Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati, Guwahati, India.', 'Stem Cell and Cancer Biology Group, Department of Biosciences and Bioengineering, Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati, Guwahati, India.', 'Department of Hematology, Gauhati Medical College and Hospital, Guwahati, India.', 'Department of Hematology, Gauhati Medical College and Hospital, Guwahati, India.', 'Department of Hematology, Gauhati Medical College and Hospital, Guwahati, India.', 'Stem Cell and Cancer Biology Group, Department of Biosciences and Bioengineering, Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati, Guwahati, India. bithiahgj@iitg.ernet.in.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20180119,England,J Biomed Sci,Journal of biomedical science,9421567,PMC5774172,['NOTNLM'],"['Bone marrow stroma', 'Chemoprotection', 'Chemotherapy', 'FGF2', 'IL6', 'Leukemia', 'Osteoblasts']",2018/01/21 06:00,2018/08/04 06:00,['2018/01/21 06:00'],"['2017/08/17 00:00 [received]', '2018/01/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/01/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/08/04 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12929-018-0407-7 [doi]', '10.1186/s12929-018-0407-7 [pii]']",epublish,J Biomed Sci. 2018 Jan 19;25(1):5. doi: 10.1186/s12929-018-0407-7.,20180803,1,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Antigens, Surface/*drug effects', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cytarabine/adverse effects', 'Daunorubicin/adverse effects', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/*drug effects/physiology', 'Transcriptome/*drug effects', 'Vincristine/adverse effects']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A typical example is stem-cell transplantation performed after successful donor identification from registered donors. Here, a suggested simple analysis based on the exogenous donor availability status according to registered donors would allow the estimation and comparison of survival probabilities. As donor search is usually ceased after a patient's event, donor availability status is incompletely observed, so that this simple comparison is not possible and the waiting time to donor identification needs to be addressed in the analysis to avoid bias. It is methodologically unclear, how to directly address cumulative long-term treatment effects without relying on proportional hazards while avoiding waiting time bias. METHODS: The pseudo-value regression technique is able to handle the first two issues; a novel generalisation of this technique also avoids waiting time bias. Inverse-probability-of-censoring weighting is used to account for the partly unobserved exogenous covariate donor availability. RESULTS: Simulation studies demonstrate unbiasedness and satisfying coverage probabilities of the new method. A real data example demonstrates that study results based on generalised pseudo-values have a clear medical interpretation which supports the clinical decision making process. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed generalisation of the pseudo-value regression technique enables to compare survival probabilities between two independent groups where group membership becomes known over time and remains partly unknown. Hence, cumulative long-term treatment effects are directly addressed without relying on proportional hazards while avoiding waiting time bias.","['Potschger, Ulrike', 'Heinzl, Harald', 'Valsecchi, Maria Grazia', 'Mittlbock, Martina']","['Potschger U', 'Heinzl H', 'Valsecchi MG', 'Mittlbock M']","[""Children's Cancer Research Institute, A-1090, Vienna, Austria."", 'Center for Medical Statistics, Informatics, and Intelligent Systems, Medical University of Vienna, Spitalgasse 23, A-1090, Vienna, Austria.', 'Center for Medical Statistics, Informatics, and Intelligent Systems, Medical University of Vienna, Spitalgasse 23, A-1090, Vienna, Austria.', ""Center of Biostatistics for Clinical Epidemiology, Department of Health Sciences, University of Milan-Bicocca, Piazza dell'Ateneo Nuovo, 1, I-20126, Milan, Italy."", 'Center for Medical Statistics, Informatics, and Intelligent Systems, Medical University of Vienna, Spitalgasse 23, A-1090, Vienna, Austria. martina.mittlboeck@meduniwien.ac.at.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180119,England,BMC Med Res Methodol,BMC medical research methodology,100968545,PMC5775686,['NOTNLM'],"['*Cox model with a time dependent covariate', '*Cumulative hazard ratio', '*Genetic randomization', '*Non-proportional hazards', '*Stem cell transplantation', '*Waiting time bias']",2018/01/21 06:00,2019/03/12 06:00,['2018/01/21 06:00'],"['2017/03/16 00:00 [received]', '2017/11/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/01/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/12 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12874-017-0430-5 [doi]', '10.1186/s12874-017-0430-5 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Med Res Methodol. 2018 Jan 19;18(1):14. doi: 10.1186/s12874-017-0430-5.,20190311,1,,IM,"['Algorithms', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Models, Statistical', 'Outcome Assessment, Health Care/*methods/*statistics & numerical data', 'Probability', '*Proportional Hazards Models', '*Regression Analysis', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/methods', 'Survival Analysis', 'Time Factors', 'Tissue Donors']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is known that the structure and expression levels of cell surface sugar chains vary depending on cell states such as inflammation and cancer. Thus, it is expected that the antibody specific for ATL cell surface sugar chain would be an effective diagnostic tool and a strong candidate for the development of an anti-ATL drug. Here, we developed a stable sugar chain-binding single-chain variable fragment antibody (scFv) that can bind to ATL cells using a fibre-type Sugar Chip and phage display method. The fiber-type Sugar Chips were prepared using O-glycans released from ATL cell lines. The scFv-displaying phages derived from human B cells (diversity: 1.04 x 108) were then screened using the fiber-type Sugar Chips, and an O-glycan-binding scFv was obtained. The flow cytometry analysis revealed that the scFv predominantly bound to ATL cell lines. The sugar chain-binding properties of the scFv was evaluated by array-type Sugar Chip immobilized with a library of synthetic glycosaminoglycan disaccharide structures. Highly sulphated disaccharide structures were found to have high affinity to scFv.","['Muchima, Kaname', 'Todaka, Taro', 'Shinchi, Hiroyuki', 'Sato, Ayaka', 'Tazoe, Arisa', 'Aramaki, Rikiya', 'Kakitsubata, Yuhei', 'Yokoyama, Risa', 'Arima, Naomichi', 'Baba, Masanori', 'Wakao, Masahiro', 'Ito, Yuji', 'Suda, Yasuo']","['Muchima K', 'Todaka T', 'Shinchi H', 'Sato A', 'Tazoe A', 'Aramaki R', 'Kakitsubata Y', 'Yokoyama R', 'Arima N', 'Baba M', 'Wakao M', 'Ito Y', 'Suda Y']","['Graduate School of Science and Engineering, Kagoshima University, 1-21-40 Kohrimoto, Kagoshima 890-0065, Japan.', 'Graduate School of Science and Engineering, Kagoshima University, 1-21-40 Kohrimoto, Kagoshima 890-0065, Japan.', 'Graduate School of Science and Engineering, Kagoshima University, 1-21-40 Kohrimoto, Kagoshima 890-0065, Japan.', 'Graduate School of Science and Engineering, Kagoshima University, 1-21-40 Kohrimoto, Kagoshima 890-0065, Japan.', 'Graduate School of Science and Engineering, Kagoshima University, 1-21-40 Kohrimoto, Kagoshima 890-0065, Japan.', 'Graduate School of Science and Engineering, Kagoshima University, 1-21-40 Kohrimoto, Kagoshima 890-0065, Japan.', 'Graduate School of Science and Engineering, Kagoshima University, 1-21-40 Kohrimoto, Kagoshima 890-0065, Japan.', 'Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Kagoshima University, Sakuragaoka 8-35-1, Kagoshima 890-8544, Japan.', 'SUDx-Biotec Corporation, Shiroyama 1-21-40, Kagoshima 890-0013, Japan.', 'SUDx-Biotec Corporation, Shiroyama 1-21-40, Kagoshima 890-0013, Japan.', 'Graduate School of Science and Engineering, Kagoshima University, 1-21-40 Kohrimoto, Kagoshima 890-0065, Japan.', 'Graduate School of Science and Engineering, Kagoshima University, 1-21-40 Kohrimoto, Kagoshima 890-0065, Japan.', 'Graduate School of Science and Engineering, Kagoshima University, 1-21-40 Kohrimoto, Kagoshima 890-0065, Japan.', 'Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Kagoshima University, Sakuragaoka 8-35-1, Kagoshima 890-8544, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,England,J Biochem,Journal of biochemistry,0376600,,,,2018/01/20 06:00,2018/05/26 06:00,['2018/01/20 06:00'],"['2017/09/12 00:00 [received]', '2017/10/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/26 06:00 [medline]', '2018/01/20 06:00 [entrez]']","['4815735 [pii]', '10.1093/jb/mvy005 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biochem. 2018 Apr 1;163(4):281-291. doi: 10.1093/jb/mvy005.,20180525,4,"['0 (Peptide Library)', '0 (Single-Chain Antibodies)', '0 (Sugars)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Binding Sites', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*immunology/*metabolism/pathology', '*Nanotechnology', '*Peptide Library', 'Single-Chain Antibodies/*immunology', 'Sugars/*immunology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, it is unclear about the role of miR-17 in glioma cells. The current study aimed to investigate effects of miR-17 mimics or inhibitor on the viability and migration of rat glioma C6 cells, and explore possible mechanisms. METHODS: The expression of miR-17 in rat glioma C6 cells and normal brain tissue was detected by quantitative PCR. Protein expression of Cyclin D1 in rat glioma C6 cells and normal brain tissue was measured by Western Blot. Glioma C6 cells were transfected with MiR-17 mimics or inhibitor. Cells that were not transfected (Lipofectamine only) and cells that were transfected with nonsense RNA negative control served as control. MTT assay was utilized to detect cell viability, and cell wound scratch assay was utilized to examine the migration index. In addition, protein expression of Cyclin D1, p-Akt and Akt in MiR-17 mimics or inhibitor-transfected glioma C6 cells was detected by Western Blot. This study had been approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University. All applicable international, national, and/or institutional guidelines for the care and use of animals were followed. RESULTS: The expression of miR-17 was significantly lower, whereas the expression of Cyclin D1 was significantly higher in glioma C6 cells compared to normal brain tissue. MiR-17 mimics decreased the viability and migration of glioma C6 cells markedly at 48 h. In addition, MiR-17 inhibitor increased the viability and migration of glioma C6 cells at 24 and 48 h. The protein expression of Cyclin D1, p-Akt and Akt in glioma C6 cells decreased after transfection with miR-17 mimics for 72 h, and increased after transfection with miR-17 inhibitor for 72 h. CONCLUSIONS: The reduced miR-17 levels in glioma cells increased cell viability and migration, which correlates with increased expression of Cyclin D1, p-Akt and Akt.","['Sun, Guangwei', 'SiMa, Guozhong', 'Wu, Chunhui', 'Fan, Yongzhong', 'Tan, Yong', 'Wang, Zhong', 'Cheng, Gang', 'Li, Jie']","['Sun G', 'SiMa G', 'Wu C', 'Fan Y', 'Tan Y', 'Wang Z', 'Cheng G', 'Li J']","['Department of Neurosurgery & Brain and Nerve Research Laboratory, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou Shi, China.', ""Department of Neurosurgery, Danyang People's Hospital, Danyang Shi, China."", ""Department of Neurosurgery, Danyang People's Hospital, Danyang Shi, China."", ""Department of Neurosurgery, Danyang People's Hospital, Danyang Shi, China."", ""Department of Neurosurgery, Danyang People's Hospital, Danyang Shi, China."", ""Department of Neurosurgery, Danyang People's Hospital, Danyang Shi, China."", 'Department of Neurosurgery & Brain and Nerve Research Laboratory, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou Shi, China.', 'Department of Neurosurgery & Brain and Nerve Research Laboratory, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou Shi, China.', ""Department of Neurosurgery, Danyang People's Hospital, Danyang Shi, China.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20180119,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,PMC5774692,,,2018/01/20 06:00,2018/02/22 06:00,['2018/01/20 06:00'],"['2017/09/01 00:00 [received]', '2017/12/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/01/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/22 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0190515 [doi]', 'PONE-D-17-28523 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2018 Jan 19;13(1):e0190515. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0190515. eCollection 2018.,20180221,1,"['0 (Ccnd1 protein, rat)', '0 (MIRN17 microRNA, rat)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Brain Neoplasms/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement/*genetics', 'Cell Survival/*genetics', 'Cyclin D1/*genetics', 'Glioma/*metabolism', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*genetics', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-6111-9422'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The presence of bovine serum and human blood proteins in AML samples can hamper the identifications of proteins, and thereby reduce the proteome coverage of the study. Herein, we have established the effect of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) washing on AML patient samples stored in media. Although PBS washes effectively removed serum and blood contaminants, the saline wash resulted in cell burst and remarkable protein material loss. We also compared different methods to preserve the AML proteome from THP-1 and Molm-13 cell lines before MS analysis: (1) stored in media containing bovine serum and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO); (2) stored as dried cell pellets; and (3) stored as cell lysates in 4% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). MS analysis of differently preserved AML cell samples shows that preservation with DMSO produce a high number of fragile cells that will burst during freezing and thawing. Our studies encourage the use of alternative preservation methods for future MS analysis of the AML proteome.","['Wangen, Rebecca', 'Aasebo, Elise', 'Trentani, Andrea', 'Doskeland, Stein-Ove', 'Bruserud, Oystein', 'Selheim, Frode', 'Hernandez-Valladares, Maria']","['Wangen R', 'Aasebo E', 'Trentani A', 'Doskeland SO', 'Bruserud O', 'Selheim F', 'Hernandez-Valladares M']","['The Proteomics Unit at the University of Bergen, Department of Biomedicine, University of Bergen, Jonas Lies vei 91, 5020 Bergen, Norway.

In this review, the MRI appearance of normal age-related BM changes, as well as the imaging features of benign and malignant diseases, are presented. DISCUSSION: A large variety of BM signal alterations has been identified and described, including normal variants, BM reconversion, degenerative changes, infections, spondyloarthritis and osteonecrosis, trauma, neoplastic lesions (both primary or metastatic), post-radiation and chemotherapy sequelae. CONCLUSIONS: Knowledge of normal age-related BM appearance, normal variants and patterns of involvement in focal and diffuse bone diseases is essential, together with clinical and laboratory data, to narrow the list of the possible differential diagnoses. The radiologist should be familiar with these signal changes, as they can sometimes be discovered incidentally. In this context, it is equally important not to attribute pathological significance to benign alterations and to promptly detect signs of malignant diseases.","['Caranci, Ferdinando', 'Tedeschi, Enrico', 'Ugga, Lorenzo', ""D'Amico, Alessandra"", 'Schipani, Serena', 'Bartollino, Silvia', 'Russo, Claudio', 'Splendiani, Alessandra', 'Briganti, Francesco', 'Zappia, Marcello', 'Melone, Mariarosa A B', 'Masciocchi, Carlo', 'Brunese, Luca']","['Caranci F', 'Tedeschi E', 'Ugga L', ""D'Amico A"", 'Schipani S', 'Bartollino S', 'Russo C', 'Splendiani A', 'Briganti F', 'Zappia M', 'Melone MAB', 'Masciocchi C', 'Brunese L']",['. ferdinando.caranci@unimol.it.'],['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20180119,Italy,Acta Biomed,Acta bio-medica : Atenei Parmensis,101295064,PMC6179071,['NOTNLM'],"['*bone marrow, avascular necrosis, leukemia, lymphoma, magnetic resonance imaging,', 'myelofibrosis, myeloma, osteomyelitis, osteonecrosis, spondyloarthritis']",2018/01/20 06:00,2019/10/29 06:00,['2018/01/20 06:00'],"['2018/01/11 00:00 [received]', '2018/01/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/01/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.23750/abm.v89i1-S.7008 [doi]'],epublish,Acta Biomed. 2018 Jan 19;89(1-S):18-33. doi: 10.23750/abm.v89i1-S.7008.,20191028,1-S,,IM,"['Aging', 'Anemia/complications', 'Bone Marrow/*diagnostic imaging/pathology', 'Bone Marrow Diseases/*diagnostic imaging', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma/diagnostic imaging', '*Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Necrosis/diagnostic imaging', 'Osteonecrosis/diagnostic imaging', 'Spinal Diseases/*diagnostic imaging', 'Spinal Neoplasms/diagnostic imaging', 'Spine/*diagnostic imaging']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These impacts may include monitoring frequency, treatment type, and disease staging level. The use of the synthetic oligonucleotide DSP30 combined with interleukin 2 (IL2) has been described as an effective mitotic stimulant in B-cell disorders, not only in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) but also in a range of other B-cell malignancies. Here, we describe the comparison of two B-cell mitogens, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and DSP30 combined with IL2 as mitogens in a range of common B-cell disorders excluding CLL. The results showed that DSP30/IL2 was an effective mitogen in mature B-cell disorders, revealing abnormal cytogenetic results in a range of B-cell malignancies. The abnormality rate increased when compared to the use of LPS to 64% (DSP30/IL2) from 14% (LPS). In a number of cases the disease burden was proportionally very low, less than 10% of white cells. In 37% of these cases, the DSP30 culture revealed abnormal results. Importantly, we also obtained abnormal conventional cytogenetics results in 3 bone marrow cases in which immunophenotyping showed an absence of an abnormal B-cell clone. In these cases, the cytogenetics results correlated with the provisional diagnosis and altered their staging level. The use of DSP30 and IL2 is recommended for use in many B-cell malignancies as an effective mitogen and their use has been shown to enable successful culture of the malignant clone, even at very low levels of disease.","['Dun, Karen A', 'Riley, Louise A', 'Diano, Giuseppe', 'Adams, Leanne B', 'Chiu, Eleanor', 'Sharma, Archna']","['Dun KA', 'Riley LA', 'Diano G', 'Adams LB', 'Chiu E', 'Sharma A']","['Cytogenetics Laboratory, Royal Hobart Hospital, Tasmania, Australia.', 'Cytogenetics Laboratory, Royal Hobart Hospital, Tasmania, Australia.', 'Cytogenetics Laboratory, Royal Hobart Hospital, Tasmania, Australia.', 'Cytogenetics Laboratory, Royal Hobart Hospital, Tasmania, Australia.', 'Cytogenetics Laboratory, Royal Hobart Hospital, Tasmania, Australia.', 'Department of Haematology, Royal Hobart Hospital, Tasmania, Australia.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20180219,United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,,,,2018/01/20 06:00,2018/09/08 06:00,['2018/01/20 06:00'],"['2017/09/20 00:00 [received]', '2018/01/16 00:00 [revised]', '2018/01/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/09/08 06:00 [medline]', '2018/01/20 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/gcc.22527 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2018 May;57(5):260-267. doi: 10.1002/gcc.22527.

METHODS: Retrospective analysis of patients referred to a quaternary cancer centre from 2000 to 2015. RESULTS: In total, 83 lesions in 82 patients were referred for further management; 52 (62%) were SCC and 80 (96%) were located in the head and neck. Reasons for referral included high-risk disease for consideration for adjuvant radiotherapy (37/83, 45%), inadequate resection (28/83, 34%) or recurrence following previous MMS (15/83, 17%). Fewer than 40% of the 69 referrals received from MMS surgeons included photos or an operative report and diagram. There was discordance in pathology opinion in 11 (13%) of cases. Histopathology from MMS was reviewed in eight cases and there was discordance with the in-hospital pathology opinion in six of these. In-hospital re-excision was performed in 19 cases and in five of these the pathology report on the paraffin-sectioned re-excised tissue was discordant with prior MMS assessment. Significantly, two cases were associated with a misinterpretation of lymphocytic infiltrate as residual disease in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). CONCLUSION: This study highlights some of the challenges and limitations of MMS. Early referral for multidisciplinary management is recommended when MMS resection margins are inadequate or uncertain, especially for high-risk SCC. We recommend that referrals be accompanied by histological material, as well as a detailed report with operative photos and diagrams. CLL can pose an intraoperative diagnostic challenge. Discrepancies in the interpretation of MMS slides present an opportunity for improvement, and our findings support the role of ongoing quality assurance programs.","['Wee, Edmund', 'Goh, Michelle S', 'Estall, Vanessa', 'Tiong, Albert', 'Webb, Angela', 'Mitchell, Catherine', 'Murray, William', 'Tran, Phillip', 'McCormack, Christopher J', 'Henderson, Michael', 'Hiscutt, Emma L']","['Wee E', 'Goh MS', 'Estall V', 'Tiong A', 'Webb A', 'Mitchell C', 'Murray W', 'Tran P', 'McCormack CJ', 'Henderson M', 'Hiscutt EL']","['Department of Surgical Oncology, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Department of Surgical Oncology, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Department of Surgical Oncology, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Department of Pathology, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Department of Pathology, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Department of Surgical Oncology, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Department of Surgical Oncology, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Department of Surgical Oncology, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20180118,Australia,Australas J Dermatol,The Australasian journal of dermatology,0135232,,['NOTNLM'],"['Mohs micrographic surgery', 'basal cell carcinoma', 'laboratory discrepancy', 'non-melanoma skin cancer', 'squamous cell carcinoma']",2018/01/20 06:00,2019/03/15 06:00,['2018/01/20 06:00'],"['2017/06/07 00:00 [received]', '2017/11/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/15 06:00 [medline]', '2018/01/20 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ajd.12779 [doi]'],ppublish,Australas J Dermatol. 2018 Nov;59(4):302-308. doi: 10.1111/ajd.12779.

The tumor suppressor PTEN plays a pivotal role in the growth of human cancer cells. We investigated whether costimulation of PPARgamma and RAR could synergistically up-regulate PTEN in human leukemia cells and consequently potentiate the inhibition of growth and cell cycle progression of these cells. We found that overexpression of PTEN with the adenoviral vector Ad/PTEN caused growth arrest at the G1 phase of the cell cycle of HL-60 cells. HL-60 cells treated with either a PPARgamma ligand (ciglitazone) or a RAR ligand(all-trans retinoic acid [ATRA]) up-regulated PTEN in HL-60 cells.

Moreover, the combination of ciglitazone and ATRA synergistically reduced cell growth rates and cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase.

Nevertheless, the effects of TBI on the mesenchymal stromal stem cell (MSC) are not fully understood. Bone marrow-derived MSCs (BM-MSCs) isolated from normal adults were irradiated with 200 cGy twice daily for consecutive 3 days, a regimen identical to that used in TBI-conditioning HSCT. The characteristics, differentiation potential, cytogenetics, hematopoiesis-supporting function, and carcinogenicity of the irradiated BM-MSCs were then compared to the non-irradiated control. The irradiated and non-irradiated MSCs shared similar morphology, phenotype, and hematopoiesis-supporting function. However, irradiated MSCs showed much lower proliferative and differentiative potential. Irradiation also induced clonal cytogenetic abnormalities of MSCs. Nevertheless, the carcinogenicity of irradiated MSCs is low in vitro and in vivo. In parallel with the ex vivo irradiation experiments, decreased proliferative and differentiative abilities and clonal cytogenetic abnormalities can also be found in MSCs isolated from transplant recipients who had received TBI-based conditioning previously. Thus, TBI used in HSCT drastically injury MSCs and may contribute to the development of some long-term complications associated with clonal cytogenetic abnormality and poor adipogenesis and osteogenesis after TBI.","['Lo, Wen-Jyi', 'Lin, Chiao-Lin', 'Chang, Yu-Chien', 'Bai, Li-Yuan', 'Lin, Chen-Yuan', 'Liang, Ji-An', 'Li, Long-Yuan', 'Chao, Ling-Min', 'Chiu, Chang-Fang', 'Chen, Chuan-Mu', 'Yeh, Su-Peng']","['Lo WJ', 'Lin CL', 'Chang YC', 'Bai LY', 'Lin CY', 'Liang JA', 'Li LY', 'Chao LM', 'Chiu CF', 'Chen CM', 'Yeh SP']","['Department of Life Sciences, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, China Medical University Hospital, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan.', 'Stem Cell Research Laboratory, Department of Medical Research, China Medical University Hospital, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, China Medical University Hospital, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan.', 'Stem Cell Research Laboratory, Department of Medical Research, China Medical University Hospital, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, China Medical University Hospital, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, China Medical University Hospital, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, China Medical University Hospital, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan.', 'Department of Life Sciences, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, China Medical University Hospital, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, China Medical University Hospital, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan.', 'Department of Life Sciences, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan. chchen1@dragon.nchu.edu.tw.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, China Medical University Hospital, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan. supengyeh@gmail.com.', 'Stem Cell Research Laboratory, Department of Medical Research, China Medical University Hospital, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan. supengyeh@gmail.com.']",['eng'],['DMR-97-118/China Medical University Hospital'],['Journal Article'],20180118,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,,['NOTNLM'],"['Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal stem cell', 'Chromosomal integrity', 'Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', 'Radiation injury', 'Total body irradiation']",2018/01/20 06:00,2018/03/10 06:00,['2018/01/20 06:00'],"['2017/04/30 00:00 [received]', '2018/01/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/10 06:00 [medline]', '2018/01/20 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00277-018-3231-y [doi]', '10.1007/s00277-018-3231-y [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2018 Apr;97(4):697-707. doi: 10.1007/s00277-018-3231-y.

A cohort of 11,270 individuals, who underwent cardiac catheterizations while aged </= 22 years in the UK, was established from hospital records. Radiation doses from cardiac catheterizations and CT scans were estimated. The cohort was matched with the NHS Central Register and NHS Transplant Registry to determine cancer incidence and transplantation status. Standardized incidence ratios (SIR) with associated confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. The excess relative risk (ERR) of lymphohaematopoietic neoplasia was also calculated using Poisson regression. The SIR was raised for all malignancies (2.32, 95% CI 1.65, 3.17), lymphoma (8.34, 95% CI 5.22, 12.61) and leukaemia (2.11, 95% CI 0.82, 4.42). After censoring transplant recipients, post-transplant, the SIR was reduced to 0.90 (95% CI 0.49, 1.49) for all malignancies. All lymphomas developed post-transplant. The SIR for all malignancies developing 5 years from the first cardiac catheterization (2 years for leukaemia/lymphoma) remained raised (3.01, 95% CI 2.09, 4.19) but was again reduced after censoring transplant recipients (0.98, 95% CI 0.48, 1.77). The ERR per mGy bone marrow dose for lymphohaematopoietic neoplasia was reduced from 0.541 (95% CI 0.104, 1.807) to 0.018 (95% CI - 0.002, 0.096) where transplantation status was accounted for as a time-dependent background risk factor. In conclusion, transplantation appears to be a large contributor to elevated cancer rates in this patient group. This is likely to be mainly due to associated immunosuppression, however, radiation exposure may also be a contributing factor.","['Harbron, Richard W', 'Chapple, Claire-Louise', ""O'Sullivan, John J"", 'Lee, Choonsik', 'McHugh, Kieran', 'Higueras, Manuel', 'Pearce, Mark S']","['Harbron RW', 'Chapple CL', ""O'Sullivan JJ"", 'Lee C', 'McHugh K', 'Higueras M', 'Pearce MS']","['Institute of Health and Society, Sir James Spence Institute, Royal Victoria Infirmary, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, NE1 4LP, UK. richard.harbron@ncl.ac.uk.', 'NIHR Health Protection Research Unit in Chemical and Radiation Threats and Hazards, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, NE2 4AA, UK. richard.harbron@ncl.ac.uk.', 'Regional Medical Physics Department, Freeman Hospital, Newcastle-upon-Tyne Hospitals NHS Trust, Newcastle upon Tyne, NE7 7DN, UK.', 'Paediatric Cardiology, Freeman Hospital, Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Newcastle upon Tyne, NE7 7DN, UK.', 'Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Radiology Department, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Trust, London, UK.', 'Institute of Health and Society, Sir James Spence Institute, Royal Victoria Infirmary, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, NE1 4LP, UK.', 'NIHR Health Protection Research Unit in Chemical and Radiation Threats and Hazards, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, NE2 4AA, UK.', 'Basque Center for Applied Mathematics, Alameda de Mazarredo, 14, 48009, Bilbao, Basque Country, Spain.', 'Institute of Health and Society, Sir James Spence Institute, Royal Victoria Infirmary, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, NE1 4LP, UK.', 'NIHR Health Protection Research Unit in Chemical and Radiation Threats and Hazards, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, NE2 4AA, UK.']",['eng'],"['PG/15/1/31217/British Heart Foundation/United Kingdom', 'N/A/Newcastle Healthcare Charity/International']","['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180118,Netherlands,Eur J Epidemiol,European journal of epidemiology,8508062,PMC5945801,['NOTNLM'],"['*Cancer', '*Cardiac', '*Dose', '*Radiation exposure', '*Transplant']",2018/01/20 06:00,2019/03/21 06:00,['2018/01/20 06:00'],"['2017/07/24 00:00 [received]', '2018/01/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/21 06:00 [medline]', '2018/01/20 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s10654-018-0357-0 [doi]', '10.1007/s10654-018-0357-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Eur J Epidemiol. 2018 Apr;33(4):393-401. doi: 10.1007/s10654-018-0357-0.

Yet, concerns regarding the long term outcome of transplantation in older patients limit the wide spread applicability of this approach. In this analysis we set out to determine the outcome of ALL patients over the age of 60 who underwent reduced intensity HSCT. Herein, we present the experience of the acute leukemia working party (ALWP) of the EBMT in this age group. We analyzed a cohort of 142 patients transplanted in first remission with a median age of 62 (range 60-76 years) and a median follow-up period of 36 months post-transplant. At 3 years, overall survival (OS) and leukemia-free survival were 42% and 35%, respectively. Multivariate analyses identified cytomegalovirus (CMV) donor-recipient matching (CMV D+/R+) to be significantly associated with inferior OS. Patients transplanted from unrelated donors experienced increased grade II-IV acute graft versus host disease compared to those receiving grafts from matched related donors [Hazard ratio (HR) of 3.7, 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.75-7.8; p = 0.0005). Outcome was not impacted by Philadelphia chromosome status.

Overall, the standard of care for patients with T-cell malignancies is poorly established, and there is an urgent clinical need for a new approach. As demonstrated in B-cell malignancies, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) immunotherapy provides great hope as a curative treatment regimen. Because PTCLs develop from mature T-cells, these NHLs are commonly CD4(+), and CD4 is highly and uniformly expressed. Therefore, CD4 is an ideal target for PTCL CAR immunotherapy. To that effect, we created a robust third-generation anti-CD4 CAR construct (CD4CAR) and introduced it into clonal NK cells (NK-92). CD4CAR NK-92 cells specifically and robustly eliminated diverse CD4(+) human T-cell leukemia and lymphoma cell lines (KARPAS-299, CCRF-CEM, and HL60) and patient samples ex vivo. Furthermore, CD4CAR NK-92 cells effectively targeted KARPAS-299 cells in vivo that modeled difficult-to-access lymphoma nodules, significantly prolonging survival. In our study, we present novel targeting of CD4 using CAR-modified NK cells, and demonstrate efficacy. Combined, our data support CD4CAR NK cell immunotherapy as a potential new avenue for the treatment of PTCLs and CD4(+) T-cell malignancies.","['Pinz, Kevin G', 'Yakaboski, Elizabeth', 'Jares, Alexander', 'Liu, Hua', 'Firor, Amelia E', 'Chen, Kevin H', 'Wada, Masayuki', 'Salman, Huda', 'Tse, William', 'Hagag, Nabil', 'Lan, Fengshuo', 'Leung, Elaine Lai-Han', 'Jiang, Xun', 'Ma, Yupo']","['Pinz KG', 'Yakaboski E', 'Jares A', 'Liu H', 'Firor AE', 'Chen KH', 'Wada M', 'Salman H', 'Tse W', 'Hagag N', 'Lan F', 'Leung EL', 'Jiang X', 'Ma Y']","['iCell Gene Therapeutics LLC, Research & Development Division, Long Island High Technology Incubator, Stony Brook, NY 11790, USA.', 'iCell Gene Therapeutics LLC, Research & Development Division, Long Island High Technology Incubator, Stony Brook, NY 11790, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Stony Brook Medicine, Stony Brook University Medical Center, Stony Brook, NY 11794, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Stony Brook Medicine, Stony Brook University Medical Center, Stony Brook, NY 11794, USA.', 'iCell Gene Therapeutics LLC, Research & Development Division, Long Island High Technology Incubator, Stony Brook, NY 11790, USA.', 'iCell Gene Therapeutics LLC, Research & Development Division, Long Island High Technology Incubator, Stony Brook, NY 11790, USA.', 'iCell Gene Therapeutics LLC, Research & Development Division, Long Island High Technology Incubator, Stony Brook, NY 11790, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Stony Brook Medicine, Stony Brook University Medical Center, Stony Brook, NY 11794, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, James Graham Brown Cancer Center, University of Louisville Health Sciences Center, Louisville, KY 40202, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Stony Brook Medicine, Stony Brook University Medical Center, Stony Brook, NY 11794, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Stony Brook Medicine, Stony Brook University Medical Center, Stony Brook, NY 11794, USA.', 'State Key Laboratory of Quality Research in Chinese Medicine, Macau Institute for Applied Research in Medicine and Health, Macau University of Science and Technology, Macau SAR, China.', 'iCell Gene Therapeutics LLC, Research & Development Division, Long Island High Technology Incubator, Stony Brook, NY 11790, USA.', 'State Key Laboratory of Quality Research in Chinese Medicine, Macau Institute for Applied Research in Medicine and Health, Macau University of Science and Technology, Macau SAR, China.', 'iCell Gene Therapeutics LLC, Research & Development Division, Long Island High Technology Incubator, Stony Brook, NY 11790, USA.', 'State Key Laboratory of Quality Research in Chinese Medicine, Macau Institute for Applied Research in Medicine and Health, Macau University of Science and Technology, Macau SAR, China.', 'Department of Pathology, Stony Brook Medicine, Stony Brook University Medical Center, Stony Brook, NY 11794, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20171122,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,PMC5762550,['NOTNLM'],"['NK cells', 'T-cell malignancies', 'chimeric antigen receptors', 'immunotherapy']",2018/01/20 06:00,2018/01/20 06:01,['2018/01/20 06:00'],"['2017/09/12 00:00 [received]', '2017/10/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/01/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/20 06:01 [medline]']","['10.18632/oncotarget.22626 [doi]', '22626 [pii]']",epublish,Oncotarget. 2017 Nov 22;8(68):112783-112796. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.22626. eCollection 2017 Dec 22.,,68,,,,,,"['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST Yupo Ma is a co-founder of iCell Gene Therapeutics, LLC.', 'The other authors have no conflicts to disclose.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Genetically, NMC is defined by the chromosomal fusion of NUTM1 with a chromatin-binding partner, typically the bromodomain-containing protein BRD4. However, little is known about other genetic aberrations in this disease. In this study, we used a unique panel of cell lines to describe the molecular-genetic features of NMC. Next-generation sequencing identified a recurring high-impact mutation in the DNA-helicase gene RECQL5 in 75% of lines studied, and biological signals from mutation-signature and network analyses consistent with a general failure in DNA-repair. A high-throughput drug screen confirmed that microtubule inhibitors, topoisomerase inhibitors and anthracyclines are highly cytotoxic in the majority of NMC lines, and that cell lines expressing the BRD4-NUTM1 (exon11:exon2) variant are an order of magnitude more responsive to bromodomain inhibitors (iBETs) on average than those with other BRD4-NUTM1 translocation variants. We also identified a highly significant correlation between iBET and aurora kinase inhibitor efficacy in this study. Integration of exome sequencing, transcriptome, and drug sensitivity profiles suggested that aberrant activity of the nuclear receptor co-activator NCOA3 may correlate with poor response to iBETs. In conclusion, our data emphasize the heterogeneity of NMC and highlights genetic aberrations that could be explored to improve therapeutic strategies. The novel finding of a recurring RECQL5 mutation, together with recent reports of chromoplexy in this disease, suggests that DNA-repair pathways are likely to play a central role in NMC tumorigenesis.","['Stirnweiss, Anja', 'Oommen, Joyce', 'Kotecha, Rishi S', 'Kees, Ursula R', 'Beesley, Alex H']","['Stirnweiss A', 'Oommen J', 'Kotecha RS', 'Kees UR', 'Beesley AH']","['Leukaemia and Cancer Genetics Program, Telethon Kids Institute, The University of Western Australia, Perth, Australia.', 'Drug Discovery Group, Telethon Kids Institute, The University of Western Australia, Perth, Australia.', 'Leukaemia and Cancer Genetics Program, Telethon Kids Institute, The University of Western Australia, Perth, Australia.', 'Leukaemia and Cancer Genetics Program, Telethon Kids Institute, The University of Western Australia, Perth, Australia.', 'Department of Haematology and Oncology, Princess Margaret Hospital for Children, Perth, Australia.', 'School of Paediatrics and Child Health, University of Western Australia, Perth, Australia.', 'Leukaemia and Cancer Genetics Program, Telethon Kids Institute, The University of Western Australia, Perth, Australia.', 'Leukaemia and Cancer Genetics Program, Telethon Kids Institute, The University of Western Australia, Perth, Australia.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20171202,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,PMC5762512,['NOTNLM'],"['DNA-repair', 'NUT midline carcinoma', 'bromodomain inhibitor', 'drug screen', 'exome sequencing']",2018/01/20 06:00,2018/01/20 06:01,['2018/01/20 06:00'],"['2017/04/21 00:00 [received]', '2017/11/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/01/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/20 06:01 [medline]']","['10.18632/oncotarget.22862 [doi]', '22862 [pii]']",epublish,Oncotarget. 2017 Dec 2;8(68):112313-112329. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.22862. eCollection 2017 Dec 22.,,68,,,,,,['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST The authors declare no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we targeted the protein folding environment in mitochondria by coupling a purine-based inhibitor of the molecular chaperone Heat Shock Protein-90 (Hsp90), PU-H71 to the mitochondrial-targeting moiety, triphenylphosphonium (TPP). Binding of PU-H71-TPP to ADP-Hsp90, Hsp90 co-chaperone complex or mitochondrial Hsp90 homolog, TRAP1 involved hydrogen bonds, pi-pi stacking, cation-pi contacts and hydrophobic interactions with the surrounding amino acids in the active site. PU-H71-TPP selectively accumulated in mitochondria of tumor cells (17-fold increase in mitochondria/cytosol ratio), whereas unmodified PU-H71 showed minimal mitochondrial localization. Treatment of tumor cells with PU-H71-TPP dissipated mitochondrial membrane potential, inhibited oxidative phosphorylation in sensitive cell types, and reduced ATP production, resulting in apoptosis and tumor cell killing. Unmodified PU-H71 had no effect. Bioinformatics analysis identified a ""mitochondrial Hsp90"" signature in Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML), which correlates with worse disease outcome. Accordingly, inhibition of mitochondrial Hsp90s killed primary and cultured AML cells, with minimal effects on normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells. These data demonstrate that directing Hsp90 inhibitors with different chemical scaffolds to mitochondria is feasible and confers improved anticancer activity.

Today, there are increasing pressures to re-examine aggressive precautionary approaches, and to assess how the principle should be applied in the modern system. In this paper, we examined three key applications of precautionary approaches in the field of transfusion medicine to provide insight into the risks and benefits of these approaches. The three case studies examined were the donor deferral policies to safeguard against transfusion transmission of human immunodeficiency virus, variant Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease, and, lastly, xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus. Characterization of precautionary applications was conducted using an embedded case study design. Our findings indicate that transfusion transmission mitigation strategies have become increasingly aggressive in the face of theoretical risks. In contrast, the review processes for implementation and reversal of precautionary policies have been slow, and historical donor deferral policies are still in place today. Application of precautionary approaches has proved challenging with both benefits and pitfalls. In light of emerging threats to the blood system, policy-makers should consider the implementation of frameworks to guide the appropriate application of precaution in transfusion medicine in the future.","['Wilson, Kumanan', 'Atkinson, Katherine M', 'Fergusson, Dean A', 'Brown, Adalsteinn', 'Forster, Alan', 'Murphy, Malia S Q', 'Tinmouth, Alan T', 'Keelan, Jennifer']","['Wilson K', 'Atkinson KM', 'Fergusson DA', 'Brown A', 'Forster A', 'Murphy MSQ', 'Tinmouth AT', 'Keelan J']","['Clinical Epidemiology Program, Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, Ottawa, Canada.', 'Departments of Medicine, and Epidemiology, Public Health and Preventive Medicine, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Canada.', 'Clinical Epidemiology Program, Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, Ottawa, Canada.', 'Department of Public Health Sciences, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Clinical Epidemiology Program, Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, Ottawa, Canada.', 'Departments of Medicine, Surgery, & of Epidemiology, Public Health and Preventive Medicine, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Canada.', 'Institute for Health Policy, Management & Evaluation, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.', 'Clinical Epidemiology Program, Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, Ottawa, Canada.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Canada.', 'Clinical Epidemiology Program, Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, Ottawa, Canada.', 'Clinical Epidemiology Program, Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, Ottawa, Canada.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Canada.', 'Dalla Lana School of Public Health, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.']",['eng'],['119492-1/Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada'],['Journal Article'],20170729,England,J Risk Res,Journal of risk research,101481554,PMC5770215,['NOTNLM'],"['Blood transfusion', 'donor exclusion', 'precautionary principle', 'risk-benefit assessment']",2018/01/20 06:00,2018/01/20 06:01,['2018/01/20 06:00'],"['2018/01/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/01/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/20 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1080/13669877.2017.1351478 [doi]'],ppublish,J Risk Res. 2018;2017:1-13. doi: 10.1080/13669877.2017.1351478.

We explored this hypothesis among 856 adult survivors of pediatric cancer exposed to curative treatments that adversely affect bone mineral density (BMD). To restrict our search to interactions among SNPs in regulatory elements, our analysis considered 75523 SNPs mapped to putative promoter or enhancer regions. In anticipation that power to detect higher order epistasis would be low using an exhaustive search and a Bonferroni-corrected threshold for genome-wide significance (e.g., P < 5.6 x 10(-14)), a novel non-exhaustive statistical algorithm was implemented to detect chromosome-wide three-way regulatory interactions. We used a permutation-based evaluation statistic to identify candidate SNP interactions with stronger associations with BMD than expected. Of the six regulatory 3-SNP interactions identified as candidate interactions (P < 3.5 x 10(-11)) among cancer survivors exposed to treatments, five were replicated in an independent cohort of survivors (N = 1428) as modifiers of treatment effects on BMD (P < 0.05). Analyses with publicly available bioinformatics data revealed that SNPs contributing to replicated interactions were enriched for gene expressions (P = 3.6 x 10(-4)) and enhancer states (P < 0.05) in cells relevant for bone biology. For each replicated interaction, implicated SNPs were within or directly adjacent to 100-kb windows of genomic regions that plausibly physically interact in lymphoblastoid cells.

BCR signalling also supports the survival and growth of malignant B cells in patients with B cell leukaemias or lymphomas. The mechanism of BCR pathway activation in these diseases includes continuous BCR stimulation by microbial antigens or autoantigens present in the tissue microenvironment, activating mutations within the BCR complex or downstream signalling components and ligand-independent tonic BCR signalling. The most established agents targeting BCR signalling are Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitors and PI3K isoform-specific inhibitors, and their introduction into the clinic is rapidly changing how B cell malignancies are treated. B cells and BCR-related kinases, such as BTK, also play a role in the microenvironment of solid tumours, such as squamous cell carcinoma and pancreatic cancer, and therefore targeting B cells or BCR-related kinases may have anticancer activity beyond B cell malignancies.","['Burger, Jan A', 'Wiestner, Adrian']","['Burger JA', 'Wiestner A']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.', 'Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA.']",['eng'],['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20180119,England,Nat Rev Cancer,Nature reviews.

Sensitivity to anti-cancer may be associated with a good prognosis in cancer patients, and NDRG2, which is induced by p53, sensitizes the cells to chemotherapy. However, the unique function of NDRG2 as an inducer of apoptosis under chemotreatment has not been sufficiently studied. In this study, we investigated the role of NDRG2 in chemo-sensitivity, focusing on cisplatin in U937 histiocytic lymphoma, which has the loss-of-functional mutation in p53. NDRG2 promoted the sensitivity to cisplatin through the modulation of the BAK-to-Mcl-1 ratio. The degradation of Mcl-1 and increase in BAK were mediated by JNK activation and the eIF2alpha/p-eIF2alpha pathway, respectively, which depended on PKR activation in NDRG2-overexpressed U937 (U937-NDRG2) cells. NOX5 was highly expressed in U937-NDRG2 cells and contributed to ROS production after cisplatin treatment. ROS scavenging or NOX5-knockdown successfully inhibited the sensitivity of U937-NDRG2 cells to cisplatin. Taken together, these findings indicate that NDRG2 contributed to the increased sensitivity to ciplatin through the modulation of Bak-to-Mcl-1 ratio regulated by NOX5-ROS-PKR pathway; therefore, we suggest that NDRG2 may be a molecular target for improving the efficacy of drug treatment in cancer patients.","['Park, Soojong', 'Oh, Sang-Seok', 'Lee, Ki Won', 'Lee, Yeon-Kyeong', 'Kim, Nae Yu', 'Kim, Joo Heon', 'Yoo, Jiyun', 'Kim, Kwang Dong']","['Park S', 'Oh SS', 'Lee KW', 'Lee YK', 'Kim NY', 'Kim JH', 'Yoo J', 'Kim KD']","['Division of Applied Life Science (BK21 Plus), Gyeongsang National University, Jinju, 52828, Republic of Korea.', 'Division of Applied Life Science (BK21 Plus), Gyeongsang National University, Jinju, 52828, Republic of Korea.', 'Division of Applied Life Science (BK21 Plus), Gyeongsang National University, Jinju, 52828, Republic of Korea.', 'Division of Applied Life Science (BK21 Plus), Gyeongsang National University, Jinju, 52828, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Eulji University School of Medicine, Daejeon, 35233, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Pathology, Eulji University School of Medicine, Daejeon, 35233, Republic of Korea.', 'Division of Applied Life Science (BK21 Plus), Gyeongsang National University, Jinju, 52828, Republic of Korea.', 'Division of Life Science, Gyeongsang National University, Jinju, 52828, Republic of Korea.', 'Division of Applied Life Science (BK21 Plus), Gyeongsang National University, Jinju, 52828, Republic of Korea. kdkim88@gnu.ac.kr.', 'Division of Life Science, Gyeongsang National University, Jinju, 52828, Republic of Korea. kdkim88@gnu.ac.kr.', 'PMBBRC, Gyeongsang National University, Jinju, 52828, Republic of Korea. kdkim88@gnu.ac.kr.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180118,England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,PMC5833685,,,2018/01/20 06:00,2019/05/22 06:00,['2018/01/20 06:00'],"['2017/06/20 00:00 [received]', '2017/11/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/11/22 00:00 [revised]', '2018/01/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/01/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/22 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41419-017-0184-3 [doi]', '10.1038/s41419-017-0184-3 [pii]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2018 Jan 18;9(2):30. doi: 10.1038/s41419-017-0184-3.,20190521,2,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BAK1 protein, human)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (NDRG2 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis', 'Cisplatin/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*metabolism', 'bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein/*metabolism']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-5886-8772'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy extend the 5-year survival limit in HCC patients by only 6%. Therefore, there is a need to develop new therapeutic approaches for the treatment of this disease. The orally bioavailable proteasome inhibitor MLN2238 (ixazomib) has been demonstrated to have anticancer activity. In the present study, we investigated the preclinical therapeutic efficacy of MLN2238 in HCC cells through in vitro and in vivo models, and examined its molecular mechanisms of action. MLN2238 inhibited cell viability in human HCC cells HepG2, Hep3B, and SNU475 in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Flow cytometry analysis demonstrated that MLN2238 induced G2/M cell cycle arrest and cellular apoptosis in HCC cells. Cell cycle arrest was associated with increased expression levels of p21 and p27. MLN2238-induced apoptosis was confirmed by caspase-3/7 activation, PARP cleavage and caspase-dependent beta-catenin degradation. In addition, MLN2238 activated ER stress genes in HCC cells and increased the expression of the stress-inducible gene nuclear protein-1. Furthermore, MLN2238 treatment induced upregulation of myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1) protein, and Mcl-1 knockdown sensitized HCC cells to MLN2238 treatment, suggesting the contribution of Mcl-1 expression to MLN2238 resistance. This result was also confirmed using the novel Mcl-1 small molecule inhibitor A1210477. Association of A1210477 and MLN2238 determined synergistic antitumor effects in HCC cells. Finally, in vivo orally administered MLN2238 suppressed tumor growth of Hep3B cells in xenograft models in nude mice. In conclusion, our results offer hope for a new therapeutic opportunity in the treatment of HCC patients.","['Augello, Giuseppa', 'Modica, Martina', 'Azzolina, Antonina', 'Puleio, Roberto', 'Cassata, Giovanni', 'Emma, Maria Rita', 'Di Sano, Caterina', 'Cusimano, Antonella', 'Montalto, Giuseppe', 'Cervello, Melchiorre']","['Augello G', 'Modica M', 'Azzolina A', 'Puleio R', 'Cassata G', 'Emma MR', 'Di Sano C', 'Cusimano A', 'Montalto G', 'Cervello M']","['Institute of Biomedicine and Molecular Immunology ""Alberto Monroy"", National Research Council (CNR), Palermo, Italy.', 'Institute of Biomedicine and Molecular Immunology ""Alberto Monroy"", National Research Council (CNR), Palermo, Italy.', 'Institute of Biomedicine and Molecular Immunology ""Alberto Monroy"", National Research Council (CNR), Palermo, Italy.', 'Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale della Sicilia ""A.

Based on the retrospective analysis of the clinical data of 59 patients with Pre-T-LBL during the period from December 2010 to December 2015, albumin level, anemia, pleural or pericardial effusion, protocol, therapy response, mediastinal mass, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and international prognostic index (IPI) or age-adjusted international prognostic index (aaIPI) were summarized. For patients aged <40 years, factors correlating with poor progression-free survival (PFS) were pleural or pericardial effusion, regimen, albumin level and therapy response. Pleural or pericardial effusion, aaIPI score, regimen, LDH increased, albumin level, therapy response and mediastinal mass were all related with poor overall survival (OS). In the patients aged >/=40 years, only anemia associated with PFS. However, anemia, involvement of bone marrow and therapeutic response were all related with poor OS. In conclusion, the patients with Pre-T-LBL are characterized by a low incidence and bad prognosis. Different prognostic factors can be discovered for patients over 40-year-old with Pre-T-LBL comparing to the youngers. New prognostic evaluation factors should be explored for patients >/=40 years old.","['Dong, Meng', 'Zhang, Xudong', 'Yang, Zhenzhen', 'Wu, Shaoxuan', 'Ma, Mijing', 'Li, Zhaoming', 'Chang, Yu', 'Wang, Xinhua', 'Li, Ling', 'Li, Xin', 'Zhang, Mingzhi', 'Chen, Qingjiang']","['Dong M', 'Zhang X', 'Yang Z', 'Wu S', 'Ma M', 'Li Z', 'Chang Y', 'Wang X', 'Li L', 'Li X', 'Zhang M', 'Chen Q']","['Department of Oncology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, 450052, PR China.', 'Department of Oncology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, 450052, PR China.', 'Department of Oncology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, 450052, PR China.', 'Department of Oncology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, 450052, PR China.', 'Department of Oncology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, 450052, PR China.', 'Department of Oncology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, 450052, PR China.', 'Department of Oncology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, 450052, PR China.', 'Department of Oncology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, 450052, PR China.', 'Department of Oncology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, 450052, PR China.', 'Department of Oncology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, 450052, PR China.', 'Department of Oncology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, 450052, PR China.', 'Department of Oncology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, 450052, PR China. qingjiang_c@126.com.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180118,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,PMC5773586,,,2018/01/20 06:00,2018/11/28 06:00,['2018/01/20 06:00'],"['2017/04/06 00:00 [received]', '2018/01/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/01/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/11/28 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-018-19565-x [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-018-19565-x [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2018 Jan 18;8(1):1088. doi: 10.1038/s41598-018-19565-x.,20181127,1,['0 (Biomarkers)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*mortality/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. We hypothesised that dasatinib alters endothelial integrity, resulting in increased pulmonary vascular endothelial permeability and pleural effusion.To test this, we established the first animal model of dasatinib-related pleural effusion, by treating rats with a daily regimen of high doses of dasatinib (10 mg.kg(-1).day(-1) for 8 weeks).Pleural ultrasonography revealed that rats chronically treated with dasatinib developed pleural effusion after 5 weeks. Consistent with these in vivo observations, dasatinib led to a rapid and reversible increase in paracellular permeability of human pulmonary endothelial cell monolayers as reflected by increased macromolecule passage, loss of vascular endothelial cadherin and zonula occludens-1 from cell-cell junctions, and the development of actin stress fibres. These results were replicated using human umbilical vein endothelial cells and confirmed by decreased endothelial resistance. Interestingly, we demonstrated that this increased endothelial permeability is a reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent mechanism in vitro and in vivo using a cotreatment with an antioxidant agent, N-acetylcysteine.This study shows that dasatinib alters pulmonary endothelial permeability in a ROS-dependent manner in vitro and in vivo leading to pleural effusion.","['Phan, Carole', 'Jutant, Etienne-Marie', 'Tu, Ly', 'Thuillet, Raphael', 'Seferian, Andrei', 'Montani, David', 'Huertas, Alice', 'Bezu, Jan van', 'Breijer, Fabian', 'Vonk Noordegraaf, Anton', 'Humbert, Marc', 'Aman, Jurjan', 'Guignabert, Christophe']","['Phan C', 'Jutant EM', 'Tu L', 'Thuillet R', 'Seferian A', 'Montani D', 'Huertas A', 'Bezu JV', 'Breijer F', 'Vonk Noordegraaf A', 'Humbert M', 'Aman J', 'Guignabert C']","['INSERM UMR_S 999, Le Plessis-Robinson, France.', 'Universite Paris-Sud and Universite Paris-Saclay, Le Kremlin-Bicetre, France.', ""Service de Pneumologie, AP-HP, Centre de Reference de l'Hypertension Pulmonaire Severe, DHU TORINO, Hopital Bicetre, Le Kremlin-Bicetre, France."", 'INSERM UMR_S 999, Le Plessis-Robinson, France.', 'Universite Paris-Sud and Universite Paris-Saclay, Le Kremlin-Bicetre, France.', ""Service de Pneumologie, AP-HP, Centre de Reference de l'Hypertension Pulmonaire Severe, DHU TORINO, Hopital Bicetre, Le Kremlin-Bicetre, France."", 'INSERM UMR_S 999, Le Plessis-Robinson, France.', 'Universite Paris-Sud and Universite Paris-Saclay, Le Kremlin-Bicetre, France.', ""Service de Pneumologie, AP-HP, Centre de Reference de l'Hypertension Pulmonaire Severe, DHU TORINO, Hopital Bicetre, Le Kremlin-Bicetre, France."", 'INSERM UMR_S 999, Le Plessis-Robinson, France.', 'Universite Paris-Sud and Universite Paris-Saclay, Le Kremlin-Bicetre, France.', ""Service de Pneumologie, AP-HP, Centre de Reference de l'Hypertension Pulmonaire Severe, DHU TORINO, Hopital Bicetre, Le Kremlin-Bicetre, France."", 'INSERM UMR_S 999, Le Plessis-Robinson, France.', 'Universite Paris-Sud and Universite Paris-Saclay, Le Kremlin-Bicetre, France.', ""Service de Pneumologie, AP-HP, Centre de Reference de l'Hypertension Pulmonaire Severe, DHU TORINO, Hopital Bicetre, Le Kremlin-Bicetre, France."", 'INSERM UMR_S 999, Le Plessis-Robinson, France.', 'Universite Paris-Sud and Universite Paris-Saclay, Le Kremlin-Bicetre, France.', ""Service de Pneumologie, AP-HP, Centre de Reference de l'Hypertension Pulmonaire Severe, DHU TORINO, Hopital Bicetre, Le Kremlin-Bicetre, France."", 'INSERM UMR_S 999, Le Plessis-Robinson, France.', 'Universite Paris-Sud and Universite Paris-Saclay, Le Kremlin-Bicetre, France.', ""Service de Pneumologie, AP-HP, Centre de Reference de l'Hypertension Pulmonaire Severe, DHU TORINO, Hopital Bicetre, Le Kremlin-Bicetre, France."", 'Dept of Physiology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Dept of Physiology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Dept of Pulmonary Disease, Institute of Cardiovascular Research, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'INSERM UMR_S 999, Le Plessis-Robinson, France.', 'Universite Paris-Sud and Universite Paris-Saclay, Le Kremlin-Bicetre, France.', ""Service de Pneumologie, AP-HP, Centre de Reference de l'Hypertension Pulmonaire Severe, DHU TORINO, Hopital Bicetre, Le Kremlin-Bicetre, France."", 'Dept of Pulmonary Disease, Institute of Cardiovascular Research, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Dept of Physiology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands christophe.guignabert@inserm.fr.', 'INSERM UMR_S 999, Le Plessis-Robinson, France.', 'Universite Paris-Sud and Universite Paris-Saclay, Le Kremlin-Bicetre, France.', ""Service de Pneumologie, AP-HP, Centre de Reference de l'Hypertension Pulmonaire Severe, DHU TORINO, Hopital Bicetre, Le Kremlin-Bicetre, France.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180118,England,Eur Respir J,The European respiratory journal,8803460,,,,2018/01/20 06:00,2019/06/19 06:00,['2018/01/20 06:00'],"['2017/05/31 00:00 [received]', '2017/10/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/01/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/19 06:00 [medline]']","['51/1/1701096 [pii]', '10.1183/13993003.01096-2017 [doi]']",epublish,Eur Respir J. 2018 Jan 18;51(1). pii: 51/1/1701096. doi: 10.1183/13993003.01096-2017.

Conditional mutagenesis of the histone 3 lysine 4 (H3K4) methyltransferase, Setd1a, revealed that it is required for the expression of DNA damage recognition and repair pathways in HSCs. Specific deletion of Setd1a in adult long-term (LT) HSCs is compatible with adult life and has little effect on the maintenance of phenotypic LT-HSCs in the bone marrow. However, SETD1A-deficient LT-HSCs lose their transcriptional cellular identity, accompanied by loss of their proliferative capacity and stem cell function under replicative stress in situ and after transplantation. In response to inflammatory stimulation, SETD1A protects HSCs and progenitors from activation-induced attrition in vivo. The comprehensive regulation of DNA damage responses by SETD1A in HSCs is clearly distinct from the key roles played by other epigenetic regulators, including the major leukemogenic H3K4 methyltransferase MLL1, or MLL5, indicating that HSC identity and function is supported by cooperative specificities within an epigenetic framework.","['Arndt, Kathrin', 'Kranz, Andrea', 'Fohgrub, Juliane', 'Jolly, Adrien', 'Bledau, Anita S', 'Di Virgilio, Michela', 'Lesche, Mathias', 'Dahl, Andreas', 'Hofer, Thomas', 'Stewart, A Francis', 'Waskow, Claudia']","['Arndt K', 'Kranz A', 'Fohgrub J', 'Jolly A', 'Bledau AS', 'Di Virgilio M', 'Lesche M', 'Dahl A', 'Hofer T', 'Stewart AF', 'Waskow C']","['Regeneration in Hematopoiesis, Institute for Immunology, and.', 'Genomics, Biotechnology Center, Center for Molecular and Cellular Bioengineering, Technische Universitat (TU) Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Regeneration in Hematopoiesis, Institute for Immunology, and.', 'Theoretical Systems Biology, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Genomics, Biotechnology Center, Center for Molecular and Cellular Bioengineering, Technische Universitat (TU) Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Max Delbruck Center for Molecular Medicine in the Helmholtz Association, Berlin, Germany.', 'Deep Sequencing Group SFB655, Biotechnology Center, and.', 'Deep Sequencing Group SFB655, Biotechnology Center, and.', 'Theoretical Systems Biology, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Genomics, Biotechnology Center, Center for Molecular and Cellular Bioengineering, Technische Universitat (TU) Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Regeneration in Hematopoiesis, Institute for Immunology, and.', 'Department of Medicine III, Faculty of Medicine, TU Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Regeneration in Hematopoiesis, Leibniz Institute on Aging, Fritz Lipmann Institute, Jena, Germany; and.', 'Faculty of Biological Sciences, Friedrich Schiller University, Jena, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180118,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,,,2018/01/20 06:00,2019/03/20 06:00,['2018/01/20 06:00'],"['2017/09/16 00:00 [received]', '2018/01/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/20 06:00 [medline]', '2018/01/20 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)32380-6 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2017-09-806844 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2018 Mar 22;131(12):1311-1324. doi: 10.1182/blood-2017-09-806844.

Ninety-seven Ph(+) ALL patients (median age 41 years; range 18-64 years) within the prospective multicenter German Multicenter ALL Study Group studies 06/99 (n = 8) and 07/2003 (n = 89) were analyzed. All patients received TKI and aSCT in first complete remission (CR1). Copy number analysis was performed with single nucleotide polymorphism arrays and validated by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification. The frequencies of recurrently deleted genes were: IKZF1, 76%; CDKN2A/2B, 45%; PAX5, 43%; BTG1, 18%; EBF1, 13%; ETV6, 5%; RB, 14%. In univariate analyses, the presence of CDKN2A/2B deletions had a negative impact on all endpoints: overall survival (P = .023), disease-free survival (P = .012), and remission duration (P = .036). The negative predictive value of CDKN2A/2B deletions was retained in multivariable analysis along with other factors such as timing of TKI therapy, intensity of conditioning, achieving remission after induction phase 1 and BTG1 deletions. We therefore conclude that acquired genomic CDKN2A/2B deletions identify a subgroup of Ph(+) ALL patients, who have an inferior prognosis despite aSCT in CR1. Their poor outcome was attributable primarily to a high relapse rate after aSCT.","['Pfeifer, Heike', 'Raum, Katharina', 'Markovic, Sandra', 'Nowak, Verena', 'Fey, Stephanie', 'Oblander, Julia', 'Pressler, Jovita', 'Bohm, Verena', 'Bruggemann, Monika', 'Wunderle, Lydia', 'Huttmann, Andreas', 'Wasch, Ralph', 'Beck, Joachim', 'Stelljes, Matthias', 'Viardot, Andreas', 'Lang, Fabian', 'Hoelzer, Dieter', 'Hofmann, Wolf-Karsten', 'Serve, Hubert', 'Weiss, Christel', 'Goekbuget, Nicola', 'Ottmann, Oliver G', 'Nowak, Daniel']","['Pfeifer H', 'Raum K', 'Markovic S', 'Nowak V', 'Fey S', 'Oblander J', 'Pressler J', 'Bohm V', 'Bruggemann M', 'Wunderle L', 'Huttmann A', 'Wasch R', 'Beck J', 'Stelljes M', 'Viardot A', 'Lang F', 'Hoelzer D', 'Hofmann WK', 'Serve H', 'Weiss C', 'Goekbuget N', 'Ottmann OG', 'Nowak D']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Johann Wolfgang Goethe University, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology and.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Medical Faculty Mannheim, Heidelberg University, Mannheim, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Johann Wolfgang Goethe University, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology and.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology and.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology and.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology and.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Campus Kiel, Kiel, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Campus Kiel, Kiel, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Johann Wolfgang Goethe University, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Mainz, Mainz, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Munster, Munster, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Johann Wolfgang Goethe University, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Johann Wolfgang Goethe University, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology and.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Johann Wolfgang Goethe University, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Department of Biomedical Statistics, Medical Faculty Mannheim, Heidelberg University, Mannheim, Germany; and.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Johann Wolfgang Goethe University, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Johann Wolfgang Goethe University, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Division of Cancer and Genetics, Cardiff University, Cardiff, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology and.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180118,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,,,2018/01/20 06:00,2019/05/15 06:00,['2018/01/20 06:00'],"['2017/07/17 00:00 [received]', '2018/01/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/15 06:00 [medline]', '2018/01/20 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)32363-6 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2017-07-796862 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2018 Mar 29;131(13):1464-1475. doi: 10.1182/blood-2017-07-796862.

Primary objectives included safety and tolerability, and secondary objectives included pharmacokinetics (PK) and disease response. Patients >/=60 years with treatment-naive AML (unfit for standard induction therapy) received PEV 20 or 30 mg/m(2) IV on days 1, 3, and 5 combined with fixed-dose AZA (75 mg/m(2) IV/subcutaneously) on days 1 to 5, 8, and 9, every 28 days. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events were constipation (48%), nausea (42%), fatigue (42%), and anemia (39%). In total, 11 deaths were observed and considered unrelated to study therapy by the investigators. Transient elevations in aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) were dose limiting. The recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of PEV in this combination is 20 mg/m(2) PEV PK was not altered by the addition of AZA. Overall response rate (ORR) based on an intent-to-treat analysis was 50% (20 complete remissions [CRs], 5 complete remission with incomplete peripheral count recovery, 7 partial remissions [PRs]), with an 8.3-month median duration of remission.

The nature of the endothelial cells and the molecular mechanisms underlying these events remain unclear in humans. Here, we identify a subset of endoglin-expressing endothelial cells enriched in human bone marrow during fetal ontogeny and upon regeneration after chemotherapeutic injury. Comprehensive transcriptional characterization by massive parallel RNA sequencing of these cells reveals a phenotypic and molecular similarity to murine type H endothelium and activation of angiocrine factors implicated in hematopoiesis, osteogenesis, and angiogenesis. Interleukin-33 (IL-33) was significantly overexpressed in these endothelial cells and promoted the expansion of distinct subsets of hematopoietic precursor cells, endothelial cells, as well as osteogenic differentiation. The identification and molecular characterization of these human regeneration-associated endothelial cells is thus anticipated to instruct the discovery of angiocrine factors driving bone marrow formation and recovery after injury.","['Kenswil, Keane Jared Guillaume', 'Jaramillo, Adrian Christopher', 'Ping, Zhen', 'Chen, Si', 'Hoogenboezem, Remco Michiel', 'Mylona, Maria Athina', 'Adisty, Maria Niken', 'Bindels, Eric Monique Johannes', 'Bos, Pieter Koen', 'Stoop, Hans', 'Lam, King Hong', 'van Eerden, Bram', 'Cupedo, Tom', 'Raaijmakers, Marc Hermanus Gerardus Petrus']","['Kenswil KJG', 'Jaramillo AC', 'Ping Z', 'Chen S', 'Hoogenboezem RM', 'Mylona MA', 'Adisty MN', 'Bindels EMJ', 'Bos PK', 'Stoop H', 'Lam KH', 'van Eerden B', 'Cupedo T', 'Raaijmakers MHGP']","['Department of Hematology, Erasmus MC Cancer Institute, Rotterdam 3015CN, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Erasmus MC Cancer Institute, Rotterdam 3015CN, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Erasmus MC Cancer Institute, Rotterdam 3015CN, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Erasmus MC Cancer Institute, Rotterdam 3015CN, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Erasmus MC Cancer Institute, Rotterdam 3015CN, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Erasmus MC Cancer Institute, Rotterdam 3015CN, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Erasmus MC Cancer Institute, Rotterdam 3015CN, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Erasmus MC Cancer Institute, Rotterdam 3015CN, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Orthopaedics, Erasmus MC, 3015 CE Rotterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Pathology, Erasmus MC Cancer Institute, Rotterdam 3015CN, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Pathology, Erasmus MC Cancer Institute, Rotterdam 3015CN, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Erasmus MC Cancer Institute, Rotterdam 3015CN, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Erasmus MC Cancer Institute, Rotterdam 3015CN, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Erasmus MC Cancer Institute, Rotterdam 3015CN, the Netherlands.

We now report a functional role for IRX3 in human acute leukemia. Although transcript levels are very low in normal human bone marrow cells, high IRX3 expression is found in approximately 30% of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), approximately 50% with T-acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and approximately 20% with B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia, frequently in association with high-level HOXA gene expression. Expression of IRX3 alone was sufficient to immortalize hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) in myeloid culture and induce lymphoid leukemias in vivo. IRX3 knockdown induced terminal differentiation of AML cells. Combined IRX3 and Hoxa9 expression in murine HSPCs impeded normal T-progenitor differentiation in lymphoid culture and substantially enhanced the morphologic and phenotypic differentiation block of AML in myeloid leukemia transplantation experiments through suppression of a terminal myelomonocytic program. Likewise, in cases of primary human AML, high IRX3 expression is strongly associated with reduced myelomonocytic differentiation. Thus, tissue-inappropriate derepression of IRX3 contributes significantly to the block in differentiation, which is the pathognomonic feature of human acute leukemias.","['Somerville, Tim D D', 'Simeoni, Fabrizio', 'Chadwick, John A', 'Williams, Emma L', 'Spencer, Gary J', 'Boros, Katalin', 'Wirth, Christopher', 'Tholouli, Eleni', 'Byers, Richard J', 'Somervaille, Tim C P']","['Somerville TDD', 'Simeoni F', 'Chadwick JA', 'Williams EL', 'Spencer GJ', 'Boros K', 'Wirth C', 'Tholouli E', 'Byers RJ', 'Somervaille TCP']","['Leukaemia Biology Laboratory, Cancer Research UK Manchester Institute, The University of Manchester, Manchester M20 4BX, UK.', 'Leukaemia Biology Laboratory, Cancer Research UK Manchester Institute, The University of Manchester, Manchester M20 4BX, UK.', 'Leukaemia Biology Laboratory, Cancer Research UK Manchester Institute, The University of Manchester, Manchester M20 4BX, UK.', 'Leukaemia Biology Laboratory, Cancer Research UK Manchester Institute, The University of Manchester, Manchester M20 4BX, UK.', 'Leukaemia Biology Laboratory, Cancer Research UK Manchester Institute, The University of Manchester, Manchester M20 4BX, UK.', 'Department of Histopathology, Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust, Manchester M13 9WL, UK.', 'Applied Computational Biology and Bioinformatics Group, Cancer Research UK Manchester Institute, The University of Manchester, Manchester M20 4BX, UK.', 'Department of Haematology, Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust, Manchester M13 9WL, UK.', 'Department of Histopathology, Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust, Manchester M13 9WL, UK.', 'Leukaemia Biology Laboratory, Cancer Research UK Manchester Institute, The University of Manchester, Manchester M20 4BX, UK.

We prospectively gathered blood samples from 36 pregnant women in whom HTLV-1 carriage was previously diagnosed and sequentially measured their proviral DNA levels. The HTLV-1 proviral DNA levels remained at a plateau during pregnancy but were elevated after delivery. Moreover, flow cytometry and serological analyses revealed that the regulatory T-cell population and soluble interleukin 2 receptor levels were similarly elevated after birth in comparison with those in control pregnant women. This study is the first to provide data on sequential changes in HTLV-1 proviral DNA levels during and after pregnancy.

The impact of reported beta-lactam (BL) allergy in this population remains unknown. Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study of adult inpatients with hematologic malignancy admitted at 2 tertiary care hospitals from 2010 through 2015. The primary outcome was hospital length of stay (LOS) after administration of the first antibiotic. Secondary outcomes included readmission, mortality, complications, hospital charges, and antibiotic usage. Our goal was to define the impact of BL-only allergy (BLOA) label on clinical outcomes compared to those with no BL allergy (NBLA) in hematologic malignancy inpatients who required systemic antibiotics. Results: In our cohort (n = 4671), 38.3% had leukemia, 4.9% had Hodgkin lymphoma, 36.1% had non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and 20.7% had multiple myeloma. Among patients, 35.1% reported antibiotic allergy, and 14.1% (n = 660) had BLOA (including 9.3% with penicillin-only allergy and 3.3% cephalosporin-only allergy). Patients with BLOA had longer median LOS compared to patients with NBLA (11.3 vs 7.6 days, P < .001), which remained significant after multivariable adjustment. Patients with BLOA also had significantly worse outcomes in terms of mortality rate at 30 days (7.6% vs 5.3%, P = .017) and 180 days (15.8% vs 12.2%, P = .013), 30-day readmission rate, Clostridium difficile rate, hospital charges ($223 046 vs $173 256, P < .001), antibiotic classes used, and antibiotic duration. Conclusions: In hospitalized patients with hematologic malignancy, patients with reported BL allergy had worse clinical outcomes and higher healthcare cost than those without BL allergy label.","['Huang, Kuan-Hsiang Gary', 'Cluzet, Valerie', 'Hamilton, Keith', 'Fadugba, Olajumoke']","['Huang KG', 'Cluzet V', 'Hamilton K', 'Fadugba O']","['Section of Allergy and Immunology, Division of Pulmonary, Allergy and Critical Care, Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia.', 'Division of Pulmonary, Allergy, Critical Care and Sleep Medicine, Albert Einstein Medical Center, Philadelphia.', 'Division of Infectious Diseases, Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia.', 'Division of Infectious Diseases, Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia.', 'Section of Allergy and Immunology, Division of Pulmonary, Allergy and Critical Care, Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Clin Infect Dis,Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America,9203213,,,,2018/01/19 06:00,2019/10/28 06:00,['2018/01/19 06:00'],"['2017/09/26 00:00 [received]', '2018/01/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/28 06:00 [medline]', '2018/01/19 06:00 [entrez]']","['4810659 [pii]', '10.1093/cid/ciy037 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Infect Dis. 2018 Jun 18;67(1):27-33. doi: 10.1093/cid/ciy037.,20191025,1,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Penicillins)', '0 (beta-Lactams)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Cohort Studies', 'Drug Hypersensitivity/*complications', 'Female', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*complications/microbiology', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitalization/*economics', 'Humans', 'Inpatients', 'Length of Stay', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Penicillins/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Tertiary Healthcare', 'beta-Lactams/*adverse effects/therapeutic use']",,,,,,,['Clin Infect Dis. 2018 Sep 14;67(7):1151.

Mechanistic studies indicate that TNFalpha induced binding of PI3K subunit p85alpha to N-terminal truncated nuclear receptor RXRalpha (tRXRalpha) proteins, and activated AKT. The activated PI3K/AKT pathway negatively regulated differentiation of AML cells through the upregulation of c-Myc. In addition, TNFalpha also induced activation of nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB), a nuclear transcription factor which was shown to promote cell proliferation. The present study demonstrates that oroxylin A, a natural compound isolated from Scutellariae radix, sensitizes leukemia cells to TNFalpha and markedly enhances TNFalpha-induced growth inhibition and differentiation of AML cell including human leukemia cell lines and primary AML cells. Activation of PI3K/AKT pathway could be inhibited by oroxylin A through inhibiting expression of tRXRalpha in NB4 and HL-60-resistant cells. Furthermore, we found that oroxylin A inhibited the activation of NF-kappaB and the DNA binding activity by TNFalpha proved by EMSA in these two AML cell lines. Moreover, in vivo studies showed that treatment with oroxylin A in combination with TNFalpha decreased AML cell population and prolonged survival in NOD/SCID mice with xenografts of primary AML cells. Overall, our results indicate that oroxylin A is able to inhibit the negative effects of TNFalpha for AML therapy, suggesting that combination of oroxylin A and TNFalpha have the potential to delay growth or eliminate the abnormal leukemic cells, thus representing a promising strategy for AML treatment.","['Li, Hui', 'Lu, Na', 'Yu, Xiaoxuan', 'Liu, Xiao', 'Hu, Po', 'Zhu, Yu', 'Shen, Le', 'Xu,

During the first study of enasidenib in humans, a minority of patients with advanced myeloid neoplasms experienced unexpected signs/symptoms of a differentiation syndrome (DS), a potentially lethal entity. Objective: To characterize IDH-inhibitor-associated DS (IDH-DS) and its effective management. Design, Setting, and Participants: Using data obtained from a multicenter, open-label, pivotal phase 1/2 study of enasidenib, a differentiation syndrome review committee retrospectively evaluated potential cases of IDH-DS in enasidenib-treated patients with R/R AML. Data were collected between August 27, 2013, and October 14, 2016. The committee identified and agreed on signs and symptoms characteristic of IDH-DS and developed an algorithm for identification and treatment. Among 281 patients with R/R AML enrolled in the trial, the committee identified 72 patients for review based on investigator-reported cases of DS (n = 33) or reported adverse events or signs and symptoms characteristic of IDH-DS. Interventions: Treatment with enasidenib at a dosage of 50 to 650 mg/d was evaluated during the dose-escalation phase, and a dosage of 100 mg/d was used in the phase 1 expansion and phase 2, all in continual 28-day cycles. Main Outcomes and Measures: Unexpected adverse events of IDH-DS during the phase 1/2 study. Results: Thirty-three of the 281 patients (11.7%) were identified as having possible or probable IDH-DS. Median age of those 33 patients was 70 years (range, 38-80 years); 20 (60.6%) were male. The most frequent manifestations were dyspnea, fever, pulmonary infiltrates, and hypoxia. Median time to onset was 30 days (range, 7-129 days). Patients who experienced IDH-DS were less likely to have less than 20% bone marrow blasts (6% vs 22%, P = .04) and more likely to have undergone fewer previous anticancer regimens (median, 1.0 [range, 1-4] vs 2.0 [range, 1-14], P = .05) at study entry than those who did not. Thirteen patients (39.4%) had concomitant leukocytosis. Isocitrate dehydrogenase differentiation syndrome was effectively managed with systemic corticosteroids. The enasidenib regimen was interrupted for 15 patients (45.5%), but permanent discontinuation of treatment was not required. Conclusions and Relevance: Isocitrate dehydrogenase differentiation syndrome is a recognizable and potentially lethal clinical entity, occurring in approximately 12% of enasidenib-treated patients with mutant-IDH2 R/R AML. It requires prompt recognition and management. As use of mutant IDH inhibitors increases, these findings and recommendations are increasingly germane to care of patients with mutant-IDH neoplasms.

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), an incurable hematologic neoplasm, has highly variable course and its heterogeneity prompts interest in exploring autophagic trajectories in CLL. We detected the mRNA levels of two autophagy-related genes, BECN1 and ATG5, assessed the association between expression levels and clinical characteristics, and did survival analysis. One hundred and six patients with CLL and fifty healthy controls were enrolled in the present study. CLL samples were found higher expression levels of BECN1 and ATG5 mRNA compared with healthy controls. Further confirmation at the protein level performed in a small cohort of patients, which included Beclin1, ATG5 and LC3-II showed the same trend. What's more, high expression at the mRNA level correlated with early Binet stage, isolated 13q deletion and negative CD38, which were associated with favor prognosis, suggesting that autophagy differs in CLL due to the presence of heterogeneity and high levels of these two genes may reflect better outcomes. Survival analysis did show patients with high expression of ATG5 mRNA had longer treatment free survival from the date of sampling.","['Kong, Yi-Lin', 'Huang, Ying', 'Wu, Jia-Zhu', 'Cao, Xin', 'Liang, Jin-Hua', 'Xia, Yi', 'Wu, Wei', 'Cao, Lei', 'Zhu, Hua-Yuan', 'Wang, Li', 'Fan, Lei', 'Li, Jian-Yong', 'Xu, Wei']","['Kong YL', 'Huang Y', 'Wu JZ', 'Cao X', 'Liang JH', 'Xia Y', 'Wu W', 'Cao L', 'Zhu HY', 'Wang L', 'Fan L', 'Li JY', 'Xu W']","['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing 210029, China; Key Laboratory of Hematology of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 210029, China; Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Personalized Medicine, Nanjing 210029, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing 210029, China; Key Laboratory of Hematology of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 210029, China; Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Personalized Medicine, Nanjing 210029, China; Department of Hematology, Yixing Hospital, Yixing 214200, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing 210029, China; Key Laboratory of Hematology of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 210029, China; Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Personalized Medicine, Nanjing 210029, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing 210029, China; Key Laboratory of Hematology of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 210029, China; Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Personalized Medicine, Nanjing 210029, China; Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nantong University, Nantong 226000, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing 210029, China; Key Laboratory of Hematology of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 210029, China; Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Personalized Medicine, Nanjing 210029, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing 210029, China; Key Laboratory of Hematology of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 210029, China; Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Personalized Medicine, Nanjing 210029, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing 210029, China; Key Laboratory of Hematology of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 210029, China; Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Personalized Medicine, Nanjing 210029, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing 210029, China; Key Laboratory of Hematology of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 210029, China; Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Personalized Medicine, Nanjing 210029, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing 210029, China; Key Laboratory of Hematology of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 210029, China; Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Personalized Medicine, Nanjing 210029, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing 210029, China; Key Laboratory of Hematology of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 210029, China; Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Personalized Medicine, Nanjing 210029, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing 210029, China; Key Laboratory of Hematology of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 210029, China; Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Personalized Medicine, Nanjing 210029, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing 210029, China; Key Laboratory of Hematology of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 210029, China; Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Personalized Medicine, Nanjing 210029, China.

Initially, a supervised machine-learning algorithm was used to identify in-focus colonies growing in a three-dimensional (3D) methylcellulose gel. Once identified, unsupervised clustering and principle component analysis of texture-based phenotypic profiles were applied to group similar phenotypes. In a proof-of-concept study, we successfully identified a novel phenotype induced by a compound that is currently in clinical trials for the treatment of leukemia.

Also, Mcl1 has the potency to resist apoptotic cues resulting in up-regulation and cancer cell protection. A molecular probe that has the potential to specifically target Mcl1 and thereby provoke its down-regulatory activity is very essential. The aim of the current study is to probe the internal conformational dynamics of protein motions and potential binding mechanism in response to a series of picomolar range Mcl1 inhibitors using explicit-solvent molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Subsequently, domain cross-correlation and principal component analysis was performed on the snapshots obtained from the MD simulations. Our results showed significant differences in the internal conformational dynamics of Mcl1 with respect to binding affinity values of inhibitors. Further, the binding free energy estimation, using three different samples, was performed on the MD simulations and revealed that the predicted energies (DeltaGmmgbsa) were in good correlation with the experimental values (DeltaGexpt). Also, the energies obtained using all sampling models were efficiently ranked. Subsequently, the decomposition energy analysis highlighted the major energy-contributing residues at the Mcl1 binding pocket. Computational alanine scanning performed on high energy-contributing residues predicted the hot spot residues. The dihedral angle analysis using MD snapshots on the predicted hot spot residue exhibited consistency in side chain conformational motion that ultimately led to strong binding affinity values. The findings from the present study might provide valuable guidelines for the design of novel Mcl1 inhibitors that might significantly improve the specificity for new-generation chemotherapeutic agents.","['Marimuthu, Parthiban', 'Singaravelu, Kalaimathy']","['Marimuthu P', 'Singaravelu K']","['Structural Bioinformatics Laboratory (SBL), Faculty of Science and Engineering, Biochemistry, Abo Akademi University , Tykistokatu 6A, FI-20520 Turku, Finland.', 'Department of Biology, Albany State University , 504 College Dr., Albany, Georgia, United States.', 'Department of Information Technology, University of Turku , FI-20520 Turku, Finland.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180201,United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,PMC6203182,,,2018/01/19 06:00,2018/05/24 06:00,['2018/01/19 06:00'],"['2018/01/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/24 06:00 [medline]', '2018/01/19 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/acs.biochem.7b01048 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochemistry. 2018 Feb 20;57(7):1249-1261. doi: 10.1021/acs.biochem.7b01048.

Central to this model is the functional interaction between the mammalian trithorax and polycomb group protein complexes. Many of the genes identified in leukemia-associated translocations are likely upstream regulators, co-participators or downstream targets of these complexes. In the natural state, these proteins interact with each other to form multimeric higher-order structures, which sequentially regulate the development of the normal hematopoietic state, either through HOX gene expression or other less defined pathways. The novel interaction domains acquired by the chimaeric fusion products subvert normal cellular control mechanisms, which result in both a failure of cell maturation and activation of anti-apoptotic pathways. The mechanisms by which these translocation products are able to affect these processes are thought to lie at the level of chromatin-mediated transcriptional activation and/or repression. The stimuli for proliferation and development of clinically overt disease may require subsequent mutations in more than one oncogene or tumor suppressor gene, or both. A more comprehensive catalogue of mutation events in malignant cells is therefore required to understand the key regulatory networks that serve to maintain multipotentiality and in particular the modifications which initiate and coordinate commitment in differentiating hematopoietic cells. We propose a model in which common pathways for leukemogenesis lie along the cell cycle control of chromatin structure in terms of transcriptional activation or repression. A clearer understanding of this cascade will provide opportunities for the design and construction of novel biological agents that are able to restore normal regulatory mechanisms. J. Cell. Biochem.

This is particularly true with regard to the acute leukemias, many of which are caused by fusion proteins that have been created by chromosomal translocations. Genetic rearrangements that disrupt the retinoic acid receptor-alpha and acute myeloid leukemia-1 genes create fusion proteins that block terminal differentiation of hematopoietic cells by repressing transcription. These fusion proteins interact with nuclear hormone co-repressors, which recruit histone deacetylases to promoters to repress transcription.

Recently, cantharidin and its analogue, norcantharidin, were also shown to suppress nonsolid tumors such as chronic myeloid leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and leukemic stem cells. However, there is no available information to address the effects of cantharidic acid (CAC), a hydrolysis product of cantharidin, on human AML cells. The present study showed that CAC, at a range of concentrations (0-20 muM), concentration-dependently inhibited cell proliferation in the HL-60 AML cell line. Western blot and flow cytometric assays demonstrated that CAC induced several features of apoptosis such as sub G1-phase cell increase, phosphatidylserine (PS) externalization, and significantly activated proapoptotic signaling including caspase-8, -9, and -3 activation and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage in HL-60 AML cells. Moreover, treatment of HL-60 cells with CAC induced concentration- and time- dependent activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). Only JNK-, but not p38 MAPK-specific inhibitor can reverse the CAC-induced activation of the caspase-8, -9, and -3. We concluded that CAC can induce apoptosis in human leukemic HL-60 cells via a caspases-dependent pathway, and that the apoptosis-inducing effect of CAC can be regulated by JNK activation signaling.","['Wang, Shih-Chung', 'Chow, Jyh-Ming', 'Chien, Ming-Hsien', 'Lin, Chiao-Wen', 'Chen, Hui-Yu', 'Hsiao, Pei-Ching', 'Yang, Shun-Fa']","['Wang SC', 'Chow JM', 'Chien MH', 'Lin CW', 'Chen HY', 'Hsiao PC', 'Yang SF']","[""Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Changhua Christian Children's Hospital, Changhua, Taiwan."", 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Wan Fang Hospital, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Graduate Institute of Clinical Medicine, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Medical Education and Research, Wan Fang Hospital, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Oral Sciences, Chung Shan Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan.', 'Department of Dentistry, Chung Shan Medical University Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Medicine, Chung Shan Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan.', 'School of Medicine, Chung Shan Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Chung Shan Medical University Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Medicine, Chung Shan Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan.', 'Department of Medical Research, Chung Shan Medical University Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20180118,United States,Environ Toxicol,Environmental toxicology,100885357,,['NOTNLM'],"['C-Jun N-terminal kinase', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'apoptosis', 'cantharidic acid']",2018/01/19 06:00,2018/04/18 06:00,['2018/01/19 06:00'],"['2017/10/20 00:00 [received]', '2018/01/03 00:00 [revised]', '2018/01/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/04/18 06:00 [medline]', '2018/01/19 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/tox.22537 [doi]'],ppublish,Environ Toxicol. 2018 Apr;33(4):514-522. doi: 10.1002/tox.22537.

The use of recombinant human erythropoietin (Epo) has consistently been shown to reduce the need for blood transfusions and to increase hemoglobin levels in lung cancer patients with chemotherapy-induced anemia. However, clinical and preclinical studies have prompted concerns that Epo and the presence of its receptor, EpoR, in tumor cells may be responsible for adverse effects and, eventually, death. The question has been raised whether Epo promotes tumor growth and inhibits the death of cancer cells. In this study, we investigated the presence and functionality of EpoR, as well as the implications of Epo upon the proliferation and survival of lung cancer cells. Since the protein expression of both Epo and EpoR is induced by hypoxia, which is frequently present in lung cancer, the cells were treated with Epo under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions (1% O2). By using quantitative (real-time) PCR, western blot analysis, and immunocytochemical staining, three non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines (A427, A549 and NCI-H358) were analyzed for the expression of EpoR and its specific downstream signaling pathways [Janus kinase 2 (Jak2)-signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5), phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt, mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase]. The effects of 100 U/ml Epo on cell proliferation and cisplatin-induced apoptosis were assessed. All NSCLC cell lines expressed EpoR mRNA and protein, while these levels differed considerably between the cell lines. We found the constitutive phosphorylation of EpoR and most of its downstream signaling pathways (STAT5, Akt and ERK1/2) independently of Epo administration. While Epo markedly enhanced the proliferation and reduced apoptosis of Epo-dependent UT-7/Epo leukemia cells, it did not affect tumor cell proliferation or the cisplatin-induced apoptosis of NSCLC cells. Thus, this in vitro study suggests that there are no tumor-promoting effects of Epo in the NSCLC cell lines studied, neither under normoxic nor under hypoxic conditions.","['Frille, Armin', 'Leithner, Katharina', 'Olschewski, Andrea', 'Olschewski, Horst', 'Wohlkonig, Christoph', 'Hrzenjak, Andelko']","['Frille A', 'Leithner K', 'Olschewski A', 'Olschewski H', 'Wohlkonig C', 'Hrzenjak A']","['Division of Pulmonology, Department of Internal Medicine, Medical University of Graz, 8036 Graz, Austria.', 'Division of Pulmonology, Department of Internal Medicine, Medical University of Graz, 8036 Graz, Austria.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Lung Vascular Research, 8010 Graz, Austria.', 'Division of Pulmonology, Department of Internal Medicine, Medical University of Graz, 8036 Graz, Austria.', 'Division of Pulmonology, Department of Internal Medicine, Medical University of Graz, 8036 Graz, Austria.', 'Division of Pulmonology, Department of Internal Medicine, Medical University of Graz, 8036 Graz, Austria.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20171212,Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,,,,2018/01/19 06:00,2018/08/07 06:00,['2018/01/19 06:00'],"['2017/08/07 00:00 [received]', '2017/11/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/01/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/08/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/ijo.2017.4225 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2018 Feb;52(2):518-526. doi: 10.3892/ijo.2017.4225.

Lung cancer results in a death higher rate each year compared to colon, breast and prostate cancer combined. Celecoxib is a selective inhibitor of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2), an enzyme of which the expression is induced by various stimuli, such as inflammation. In addition, celecoxib triggers COX-2 loading on exosomes. Exosomes are small vesicles composed of a lipid bilayer membrane and are found in most biological fluids, such as blood breast milk and urine. In this study, we focused on exosomes containing COX-2 proteins from lung cancer cells to determine their involvement in the interaction with neighbor cells following treatment with celecoxib. We found that celecoxib induced COX-2 expression in both the cytosol and exosomes in lung cancer cells. Exosomes from celecoxib-treated lung cancer cell culture supernatant were isolated and incubated with several types of cells. The THP-1, monocytic leukemia cell line effectively absorbed COX-2 by lung cancer cell-derived exosomes. Following incubation with exosomes, the COX-2 protein level was increased in the THP-1 cells; however, COX-2 mRNA expression was not affected. Moreover, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) production by THP-1 cells was increased following incubation with exosomes from celecoxib-treated lung cancer cells. Conditioned medium from THP-1 following incubation with exosomes promoted formation in EA.hy926 cells. Taken together, our findings suggest that celecoxib induces COX-2 expression in lung cancer cells, and that highly expressed COX-2 in exosomes can be transferred to other cells.","['Kim, Jayoung', 'Hong, Seung-Woo', 'Kim, Seonghan', 'Kim, Daejin', 'Hur, Dae Young', 'Jin, Dong-Hoon', 'Kim, Bomi', 'Kim, Yeong Seok']","['Kim J', 'Hong SW', 'Kim S', 'Kim D', 'Hur DY', 'Jin DH', 'Kim B', 'Kim YS']","['Department of Anatomy and Research Center for Tumor Immunology, College of Medicine, Inje University, Busan 47392, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Anatomy and Research Center for Tumor Immunology, College of Medicine, Inje University, Busan 47392, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Anatomy and Research Center for Tumor Immunology, College of Medicine, Inje University, Busan 47392, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Anatomy and Research Center for Tumor Immunology, College of Medicine, Inje University, Busan 47392, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Anatomy and Research Center for Tumor Immunology, College of Medicine, Inje University, Busan 47392, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Convergence Medicine, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul 05505, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Pathology, Haeundae Paik Hospital, College of Medicine, Inje University, Busan 48108, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Anatomy and Research Center for Tumor Immunology, College of Medicine, Inje University, Busan 47392, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20171213,Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,,,,2018/01/19 06:00,2018/08/07 06:00,['2018/01/19 06:00'],"['2017/09/05 00:00 [received]', '2017/12/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/01/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/08/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/ijo.2017.4227 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2018 Feb;52(2):613-620. doi: 10.3892/ijo.2017.4227.

We evaluated the expression/activity of CTSL in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMCs) of 103 pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients to assess its prognostic significance in this malignancy. Thirty-five healthy siblings of patients served as controls. Our results revealed significantly higher CTSL activity (p < .0001), protein (p < .05), and mRNA levels (p < .01) in both PBMCs and BMMCs of patients as compared with controls. BMMCs displayed higher activity of CTSL than PBMCs (p < .01). A dramatic reduction in CTSL activity was recorded after chemotherapy in a significant proportion (74%) of patients (p < .0001). By multivariate analysis, CTSL in BMMCs emerged as a strong independent prognostic marker for overall survival (OS) (p = .004).

Eighteen patients participated, who were diagnosed with lymphoma, myeloma, leukemia, or idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura. Four themes emerged: side-effects, misattribution of cause, self-management, and fragmented information. The study results revealed that hematology patients administered steroids can experience negligible to extensive erratic side-effects, with severe adverse repercussions. Psychological reactions to steroids are often misattributed. Patients mostly self-manage adverse effects experienced and receive only fragmented preparatory information, often not understanding steroid side-effects. Nurses could provide helpful ""in the moment"" education for inpatients who misunderstood steroid-related adverse effects, such as aggressive urges. Adverse repercussions for family were occasionally evident. Education, support, and ongoing care for patients experiencing adverse steroid side-effects are inadequate.

In our previous work, we showed that the miR-595-related polymorphism, rs1051296 G>T, which was located in the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of SLC19A1, was associated with high methotrexate (MTX) plasma concentrations in patients with paediatric acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). This study aimed to investigate the role of miR-595 in the regulation of SLC19A1 expression and its effects on the cellular uptake and cytotoxicity of MTX in ALL CEM/C1 cells. Luciferase reporter assay was performed to validate SLC19A1 as a miR-595 target. RFC1 protein expression was determined via Western blotting. Intracellular MTX concentrations were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Cell viability and apoptosis were assessed using Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay and flow cytometer, respectively. Compared to the negative control, miR-595 mimics induced a significant decrease in the relative luciferase activity by binding to the 3'-UTR of SLC19A1 harbouring the rs1051296 T allele (p < 0.01). Treatment of CEM/C1 cells with miR-595 mimics substantially reduced RFC1 protein expression, intracellular MTX levels, MTX-induced cytotoxicity and apoptosis rates compared to those of negative control. However, opposite results were observed in cells transfected with a miR-595 inhibitor. These findings suggested that miR-595 acts as a phenotypic regulator of MTX sensitivity in CEM/C1 cells by targeting SLC19A1. This study helped us to understand the mechanisms underlying the variable MTX responses observed in patients with ALL.","['Wang, Shu-Mei', 'Sun, Lu-Lu', 'Wu, Wan-Shui', 'Yan, Dan']","['Wang SM', 'Sun LL', 'Wu WS', 'Yan D']","['Beijing Key Laboratory of Bio-characteristic Profiling for Evaluation of Rational Drug Use, Beijing Shijitan Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Beijing Shijitan Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.', 'Beijing Key Laboratory of Bio-characteristic Profiling for Evaluation of Rational Drug Use, Beijing Shijitan Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Beijing Shijitan Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.', 'Beijing Key Laboratory of Bio-characteristic Profiling for Evaluation of Rational Drug Use, Beijing Shijitan Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Beijing Shijitan Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20180222,England,Basic Clin Pharmacol Toxicol,Basic & clinical pharmacology & toxicology,101208422,,,,2018/01/19 06:00,2018/10/12 06:00,['2018/01/19 06:00'],"['2017/10/10 00:00 [received]', '2018/01/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/12 06:00 [medline]', '2018/01/19 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/bcpt.12966 [doi]'],ppublish,Basic Clin Pharmacol Toxicol. 2018 Jul;123(1):8-13. doi: 10.1111/bcpt.12966.

However, in clinical applications, the outcomes under the optimal protocols are sensitive to variations of parameter settings such as drug effects and the attributes of age, weight, and health conditions in human subjects. One approach to overcoming this challenge is to formulate the problem of finding an optimal treatment protocol as a robust optimization problem (ROP) that takes parameter uncertainty into account. In this chapter, we describe a method to model toxicity uncertainty. We then apply a mixed integer ROP to derive the optimal protocols that minimize the cumulative tumor size. While our method may be applied to other cancers, in this work we focus on the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI). For simplicity, we focus on one particular mode of toxicity arising from TKI therapy, low blood cell counts, in particular low absolute neutrophil count (ANC). We develop optimization methods for locating optimal treatment protocols assuming that the rate of decrease of ANC varies within a given interval. We further investigated the relationship between parameter uncertainty and optimal protocols. Our results suggest that the dosing schedule can significantly reduce tumor size without recurrence in 360 weeks while insuring that toxicity constraints are satisfied for all realizations of uncertain parameters.","['Zhu, Junfeng', 'Badri, Hamidreza', 'Leder, Kevin']","['Zhu J', 'Badri H', 'Leder K']","['Industrial and Systems Engineering, University of Minnesota, 111 Church street SE, Minneapolis, MN, 55455, USA.', 'Industrial and Systems Engineering, University of Minnesota, 111 Church street SE, Minneapolis, MN, 55455, USA.', 'Industrial and Systems Engineering, University of Minnesota, 111 Church street SE, Minneapolis, MN, 55455, USA. kevin.leder@isye.umn.edu.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",,United States,Methods Mol Biol,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",9214969,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Cancer treatment', '*Mixed integer optimization', '*Robust optimization', '*Toxicity uncertainty']",2018/01/19 06:00,2018/10/26 06:00,['2018/01/19 06:00'],"['2018/01/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/01/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/978-1-4939-7493-1_15 [doi]'],ppublish,Methods Mol Biol. 2018;1711:297-331. doi: 10.1007/978-1-4939-7493-1_15.,20181025,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Algorithms', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Blood Cell Count', 'Computer Simulation', 'Drug Therapy, Computer-Assisted/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Models, Biological', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/adverse effects/*therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Uncertainty']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, a clinically available therapeutic regimen for this compound needs to be established and its functional mechanisms in relation to the dosing schedule need to be clarified. In this study, we evaluated the antitumor activity and toxicity of DFP-10917 by varying the dose and administration schedule in human solid tumor and leukemia xenografts in vivo. Compared to a 1-day infusion with a high-dose of DFP-10917 (30 mg/kg/day), a prolonged 14-day infusion with a low-dose (4.5 mg/kg/day) exerted superior tumor growth inhibitory effects without decreasing the body weights of mice in our human tumor xenograft model. In addition, we found that a 14-day infusion of low-dose DFP-10917 markedly prolonged the lifespan of nude mice bearing both acute leukemia and ovarian cancer cell-derived tumors. On the other hand, gemcitabine (GEM) and cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C), which are similar deoxycytidine analogs and are widely used clinically as standard regimens, exerted less potent antitumor effects than DFP-10917 on these tumors. To elucidate the possible functional mechanisms of the prolonged infusion of DFP-10197 compared with that of GEM or Ara-C, the rate of DNA damage in CCRF-CEM and HeLa cells treated with DFP-10917, Ara-C and GEM was detected using a comet assay. DFP-10917, at a range of 0.05 to 1 microM, induced a clear tailed-DNA pattern in both the CCRF-CEM and HeLa cells; Ara-C and GEM did not have any effect. It was thus suggested that a low concentration and long-term exposure to DFP-10917 aggressively introduced the fragmentation of DNA molecules, namely the so-called double-strand breaks in tumor cells, leading to potent cytotoxicity. Moreover, treatment with DFP-10917 at a low-dose with a long-term exposure specifically increased the population of cells in the G2/M phase, while GEM reduced this cell population, suggesting a unique function (G2/M arrest) of DFP-10917. On the whole, our findings indicate that the prolonged infusion of low-dose DFP-10917 mainly displays a novel functional mechanism as a DNA-damaging drug and may thus prove to be useful in the treatment of cancer patients who are resistant to other cytosine nucleosides, or in patients in which these other nucleosides have been shown to be ineffective.","['Iizuka, Kenzo', 'Zhang, Chun', 'Eshima, Kokoro', 'Jin, Cheng', 'Eshima, Kiyoshi', 'Fukushima, Masakazu']","['Iizuka K', 'Zhang C', 'Eshima K', 'Jin C', 'Eshima K', 'Fukushima M']","['Division of Oncology Research and Development, Delta-Fly Pharma Inc., Kawauchi-cho, Tokushima 771-0116, Japan.', 'Division of Oncology Research and Development, Delta-Fly Pharma Inc., Kawauchi-cho, Tokushima 771-0116, Japan.', 'Division of Oncology Research and Development, Delta-Fly Pharma Inc., Kawauchi-cho, Tokushima 771-0116, Japan.', 'Division of Oncology Research and Development, Delta-Fly Pharma Inc., Kawauchi-cho, Tokushima 771-0116, Japan.', 'Division of Oncology Research and Development, Delta-Fly Pharma Inc., Kawauchi-cho, Tokushima 771-0116, Japan.', 'Division of Oncology Research and Development, Delta-Fly Pharma Inc., Kawauchi-cho, Tokushima 771-0116, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20180116,Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,,,,2018/01/19 06:00,2018/09/01 06:00,['2018/01/19 06:00'],"['2017/07/07 00:00 [received]', '2018/01/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/09/01 06:00 [medline]', '2018/01/19 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.3892/ijo.2018.4246 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2018 Mar;52(3):851-860. doi: 10.3892/ijo.2018.4246.

However, the role of RTEL1 mutations in other bone marrow failure (BMF) syndromes and myeloid neoplasms, and the contribution of monoallelic RTEL1 mutations to disease development are not well defined. We screened 516 patients for germline mutations in telomere-associated genes by next-generation sequencing in 2 independent cohorts; one constituting unselected patients with idiopathic BMF, unexplained cytopenia, or myeloid neoplasms (n = 457) and a second cohort comprising selected patients on the basis of the suspicion of constitutional/familial BMF (n = 59). Twenty-three RTEL1 variants were identified in 27 unrelated patients from both cohorts: 7 variants were likely pathogenic, 13 were of uncertain significance, and 3 were likely benign. Likely pathogenic RTEL1 variants were identified in 9 unrelated patients (7 heterozygous and 2 biallelic). Most patients were suspected to have constitutional BMF, which included aplastic anemia (AA), unexplained cytopenia, hypoplastic myelodysplastic syndrome, and macrocytosis with hypocellular bone marrow. In the other 18 patients, RTEL1 variants were likely benign or of uncertain significance. Telomeres were short in 21 patients (78%), and 3' telomeric overhangs were significantly eroded in 4. In summary, heterozygous RTEL1 variants were associated with marrow failure, and telomere length measurement alone may not identify patients with telomere dysfunction carrying RTEL1 variants. Pathogenicity assessment of heterozygous RTEL1 variants relied on a combination of clinical, computational, and functional data required to avoid misinterpretation of common variants.","['Marsh, Judith C W', 'Gutierrez-Rodrigues, Fernanda', 'Cooper, James', 'Jiang, Jie', 'Gandhi, Shreyans', 'Kajigaya, Sachiko', 'Feng, Xingmin', 'Ibanez, Maria Del Pilar F', 'Donaires, Flavia S', 'Lopes da Silva, Joao P', 'Li, Zejuan', 'Das, Soma', 'Ibanez, Maria', 'Smith, Alexander E', 'Lea, Nicholas', 'Best, Steven', 'Ireland, Robin', 'Kulasekararaj, Austin G', 'McLornan, Donal P', 'Pagliuca, Anthony', 'Callebaut, Isabelle', 'Young, Neal S', 'Calado, Rodrigo T', 'Townsley, Danielle M', 'Mufti, Ghulam J']","['Marsh JCW', 'Gutierrez-Rodrigues F', 'Cooper J', 'Jiang J', 'Gandhi S', 'Kajigaya S', 'Feng X', 'Ibanez MDPF', 'Donaires FS', 'Lopes da Silva JP', 'Li Z', 'Das S', 'Ibanez M', 'Smith AE', 'Lea N', 'Best S', 'Ireland R', 'Kulasekararaj AG', 'McLornan DP', 'Pagliuca A', 'Callebaut I', 'Young NS', 'Calado RT', 'Townsley DM', 'Mufti GJ']","[""Department of Haematological Medicine, King's College Hospital, London, United Kingdom."", ""Department of Haematological Medicine, Cancer Studies Division, Rayne Institute, King's College, London, United Kingdom."", 'Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, University of Sao Paulo at Ribeirao Preto School of Medicine, Ribeirao Preto, Brazil.', 'Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD.', ""Department of Haematological Medicine, Cancer Studies Division, Rayne Institute, King's College, London, United Kingdom."", ""Department of Haematological Medicine, King's College Hospital, London, United Kingdom."", ""Department of Haematological Medicine, Cancer Studies Division, Rayne Institute, King's College, London, United Kingdom."", 'Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD.', 'Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD.', 'Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, University of Sao Paulo at Ribeirao Preto School of Medicine, Ribeirao Preto, Brazil.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, University of Sao Paulo at Ribeirao Preto School of Medicine, Ribeirao Preto, Brazil.', 'University of Chicago Genetic Services Laboratory, Chicago, IL;

A differential diagnosis of masquerade syndromes should be considered in cases of hypopyon uveitis that are atypical or unresponsive to treatment. We report a case of a 45-year-old man who presented with bilateral hypopyon uveitis and was subsequently diagnosed as having chronic myeloid leukemia. Method: Retrospective case review. Results: A 45-year-old diabetic male presented with diminished vision in both eyes for 10 days. Ophthalmic evaluation revealed rubeosis iridis, hypopyon, and signs of proliferative diabetic retinopathy with panretinal laser photocoagulation scars. He subsequently presented 1 week later with a bloodstained hypopyon in his right eye and a persistent hypopyon in his left eye. A peripheral blood smear and subsequent bone marrow trephine biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of chronic myeloid leukemia in blast crisis and he was referred to an oncologist for further management. Conclusion: A recalcitrant or atypical hypopyon uveitis can be an indicator of a blast crisis or a central nervous system involvement or sign of a relapse in cases of leukemia. The presence of unusual bloodstained hypopyon helped in identifying the presence of chronic myeloid leukemia and aided in a prompt oncology consultation.","['Tyagi, Mudit', 'Govindhari, Vishal', 'Pappuru, Rajeev R', 'Ambiya, Vikas']","['Tyagi M', 'Govindhari V', 'Pappuru RR', 'Ambiya V']","['Kanuri Santhamma Center for Vitreo-Retina Services, L.V.

Methods: A pilot randomized study in HLA-A02(+) patients to receive vaccination with WT1 in Montanide or in poly ICLC, a TLR3 agonist, to explore the novel immune adjuvant was conducted. Seven patients were randomized. Four patients received WT1 in Montanide, and three with WT1 in poly ICLC. Five patients were in morphologic remission and two had residual morphologic disease at the study entry. Results: All patients finished the induction phase without any major toxicity except mild transient local injection reaction. One patient on the Montanide arm developed aseptic ulceration at two vaccine sites which healed without antibiotics. Three of 4 patients on the Montanide arm had a decreased expression of WT1 after WT1 vaccination, and two of them demonstrated generation of WT1-specific cytotoxic CD8(+) T cell responses with biased TCR beta chain enrichment. In contrast, no obvious WT1-specific immune responses were detected in two patients on the poly ICLC arm, nor was there clonal enrichment by TCR alpha/beta sequencing; however, these patients did also have decreased WT1 expression and remained in remission several years after the initiation of treatment. Conclusions: WT1 peptide vaccine with Montanide as an adjuvant induces detectable WT1-specific CD8(+) T cell responses with clonal TCR enrichment, which may be capable of controlling leukemia recurrence in the setting of minimal residual disease. Poly ICLC may induce anti-leukemic activity in the absence of detectable WT1 specific CD8(+) T cell responses.Trial registration NCT01842139, 7/3/2012 retrospectively registered; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01842139.","['Liu, Hongtao', 'Zha, Yuanyuan', 'Choudhury, Noura', 'Malnassy, Gregory', 'Fulton, Noreen', 'Green, Margaret', 'Park, Jae-Hyun', 'Nakamura, Yusuke', 'Larson, Richard A', 'Salazar, Andres M', 'Odenike, Olatoyosi', 'Gajewski, Thomas F', 'Stock, Wendy']","['Liu H', 'Zha Y', 'Choudhury N', 'Malnassy G', 'Fulton N', 'Green M', 'Park JH', 'Nakamura Y', 'Larson RA', 'Salazar AM', 'Odenike O', 'Gajewski TF', 'Stock W']","['1Section of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Chicago Medical Center, 5841 S.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the expression of PU.1 in breast cancer and to analyze its association with clinical features and prognosis. Immunohistochemistry was used to determine PU.1 expression in breast cancer tissue microarrays and paraffin-embedded sections. The association between PU.1 expression and clinicopathological factors was assessed by using chi-square test. The survival analysis of patients was conducted by using Kaplan-Meier analysis and log-rank tests. Cox regression was utilized for univariate and multivariate analyses of prognostic factors. The results indicated that the expression level of PU.1 protein in breast cancer samples was significantly higher compared with normal breast tissues (P=2.63x10(-8)). Furthermore, the level of PU.1 expression was detected to be positively associated with androgen receptor (P=0.027) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 status (P=2.03x10(-21)) as well as molecular subtype (P=3.51x10(-11)). Furthermore, patients with negative PU.1 expression had longer OR compared with those with positive PU.1 expression (P=3.67x10(-4)). Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that PU.1 expression level and tumor-node-metastasis stage were independent prognostic factors for overall survival (P=0.034 and P=0.018, respectively). Therefore, PU.1 protein expression may contribute to breast cancer progression and may be a valuable molecular marker to predict the prognosis of patients with breast cancer.","['Lin, Jing', 'Liu, Wei', 'Luan, Tian', 'Yuan, Lili', 'Jiang, Wei', 'Cai, Huilong', 'Yuan, Weiguang', 'Wang, Yuwen', 'Zhang, Qingyuan', 'Wang, Lihong']","['Lin J', 'Liu W', 'Luan T', 'Yuan L', 'Jiang W', 'Cai H', 'Yuan W', 'Wang Y', 'Zhang Q', 'Wang L']","['Department of Cytobiology, Institute of Cancer Prevention and Treatment, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, Heilongjiang 150081, P.R.

Lesions of the CNS were observed during and following treatment of leukemia. The data from stereotactic biopsy-proven pathology (12 patients) and MRI examinations (14 patients) were retrospectively evaluated. Proton-magnetic resonance-spectroscopy was performed in three patients. Factors that predisposed to lesions of the CNS were reviewed from the patient medical records. Among the 14 patients, eight had CNS leukemia, four had a CNS infection and two had a neurodegenerative disorder (one leukoencephalopathy and one glial cell hyperplasia). The clinical diagnosis based on clinical symptoms, signs and MRI features was not consistent with the pathological diagnosis in two patients. In one patient, the clinical diagnosis was a CNS infection; however, the patient's pathological diagnosis was CNS leukemia. In the other patient, the clinical diagnosis was CNS leukemia, but the pathological diagnosis was glial cell hyperplasia. CNS lesions in leukemia have a wide range of causes. Apart from the relapse of leukemia in the CNS, there are treatment-associated neurotoxicities and infections that are caused by immunocompromised states. As numerous leukemia-associated CNS lesions are treatable, early diagnosis is essential.","['Liu, Jing', 'Wang, Yaming', 'Sun, Xuefei', 'Liu, Shuo', 'Yu, Zhenkun', 'Ji, Nan', 'Sun, Shengjun', 'Liu, Yuanbo']","['Liu J', 'Wang Y', 'Sun X', 'Liu S', 'Yu Z', 'Ji N', 'Sun S', 'Liu Y']","['Department of Hematology, Beijing Tiantan Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing 100050, P.R.

In the present study, the expression of miR-218 and its effects on the viability and proliferation of HL-60 cells was investigated. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis demonstrated that miR-218 was frequently downregulated in APL marrow tissues compared with normal marrow tissues. Overexpression of miR-218 significantly inhibited cell proliferation, arrested the cell cycle in the G0/G1 phase and induced apoptosis. In addition, B-cell-specific Moloney murine leukemia virus integration site 1 (BMI-1) mRNA expression was negatively associated with miR-218 expression; BMI-1 mRNA and protein expression were downregulated following transfection with miR-218 mimic.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the possible implication of MUC1 in radioresistance of HCC cells and the underlying mechanisms. It was demonstrated that MUC1 was significantly upregulated in HCC cells following irradiation exposure, which was coupled with increased phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). Enforced expression of MUC1 significantly (P<0.05) promoted the clonogenic survival of HCC cells following irradiation compared with empty vector-transfected cells. MUC1 overexpression resulted in >60% reduction in apoptosis induced by irradiation, as determined by Annexin-V/propidium iodide double staining and flow cytometry analysis. Furthermore, overexpression of MUC1 significantly (P<0.05) attenuated the activation of caspase-3 and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase in response to irradiation exposure. Mechanistically, MUC1 inhibited irradiation-induced apoptosis through activation of janus kinase 2 (JAK2) and STAT3, and induction of anti-apoptotic proteins induced myeloid leukemia cell differentiation protein Mcl-1 (Mcl-1) and BCL2 like 1 (Bcl-xL). Small hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown of STAT3 or MUC1 resensitized MUC1-overexpressing cells to irradiation-induced apoptosis, which was accompanied by reduced expression of Bcl-xL and Mcl-1. Collectively, MUC1 contributes to radioresistance of HCC cells likely through activation of the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway and thus represents a potential target for improving radiotherapy against HCC.","['Yi, Feng-Tao', 'Lu, Qi-Ping']","['Yi FT', 'Lu QP']","[""Department of Radiotherapy, Wuhan General Hospital of Guangzhou Command, People's Liberation Army, Wuhan, Hubei 430070, P.R.

Patients with AS usually develop spontaneous pneumothorax several years after the diagnosis of AS. The present study reports the unusual case and complicated clinical history of a 29-year-old man with recurrent pneumothorax and AS, who developed CML following repeated exposure to low doses of radiation via diagnostic X-rays and chest computed tomography imaging. Pneumothorax was diagnosed prior to AS in this patient; the present case report highlights the importance of recognizing AS as a possible underlying cause of recurrent spontaneous pneumothorax. Patients with AS may be more sensitive to injury via X-ray-derived radiation, and even small diagnostic doses may be associated with CML. Diagnostic X-ray exposure should therefore be limited to reduce the risk of radiation-associated malignancies, including CML, particularly in patients with AS.","['Ju, Fang-He', 'Gong, Xu-Bo', 'Xu, Ting-Zhen', 'Jiang, Li-Bin', 'Hong, Hui-Hua', 'Wang, Zhen']","['Ju FH', 'Gong XB', 'Xu TZ', 'Jiang LB', 'Hong HH', 'Wang Z']","['Department of Respiratory Medicine, Zhejiang Provincial Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Hangzhou, Zhejiang 310006, P.R.

The patient presented with general weakness, abdominal distension and tenderness in the right hypochondrium. A chest X-ray revealed a right-sided heart. Ultrasonography revealed situs inversus totalis. A bone marrow smear demonstrated CML in the accelerated phase. Imatinib mesylate was subsequently administered; the patient stopped taking imatinib mesylate following discharge from the hospital. The patient presented with dizziness, fatigue, and abdominal distention and pain 1 year subsequently. A bone marrow smear demonstrated CML in the blast crisis phase; CML had progressed to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) M2a. The patient was treated with imatinib mesylate and cytarabine. After 5 days, the white blood cell count had decreased compared with that measured at the time of admission, and the previous relevant symptoms had disappeared. The patient succumbed to AML 3 months after discharge from the hospital. Situs inversus totalis is an uncommon congenital anomaly that often occurs concomitantly with other disorders. The present study documented, to the best of our knowledge, the second recorded case of CML in a patient with situs inversus totalis. Previous studies on the pathogenesis of situs inversus have suggested it is caused by embryonic cells failing to rotate normally during early embryonic development. Although there are case reports of situs inversus totalis in patients with cancer, there are few reports on the association between situs inversus totalis and cancer. The present study examined a case of CML with situs inversus totalis and assessed whether the latter may be associated with cancer.","['Sun, Yunxia', 'Li, Xiaoli', 'Li, Lijun', 'Liu, Huan', 'Xu, Qian', 'Liu, Bei']","['Sun Y', 'Li X', 'Li L', 'Liu H', 'Xu Q', 'Liu B']","['Medical Department, The First Clinical Medical College, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, Gansu 730000, P.R.

PML-RARalpha can be cleaved by neutrophil elastase (NE) in several positions in cells in the promyelocytic stage, nuclear location signal (NLS)-negative PML and NLS-RARalpha may be the products of PML-RARalpha by NE. The function of NLS-RARalpha may be affected by the addition of NLS, which would alter its localization in cells, as the role of NLS is to identify proteins for transport to the nucleus. Preliminary experiments demonstrated that the overexpression of NLS-RARalpha in HL-60 cells could promote cellular proliferation and inhibit cellular differentiation. Following treatment with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), the degree of cellular differentiation was enhanced. In the present study, the localization of NLS-RARalpha was identified and its activity as a novel transcriptional factor was assessed, which may be critical in the development of APL. The location of NLS-RARalpha was detected in the nucleus and cytoplasm by indirect immunofluorescence and western blot analysis, with expression in the nucleus revealed to be increased compared with that in the cytoplasm. Next, native-PAGE was performed and NLS-RARalpha and RXRalpha were revealed to form heterodimers in the nucleus. In addition, co-immunoprecipitation revealed an interaction between NLS-RARalpha and retinoid X receptor-alpha (RXRalpha). An electrophoresis mobility shift assay (EMSA) indicated that NLS-RARalpha could bind retinoic acid response elements (RAREs) in the presence of ATRA. Indeed, NLS-RARalpha could bind RAREs just as WTRARalpha could, including the RAREs direct repeat-2 (DR-2) and DR-5. In addition, results from a luciferase reporter gene assay demonstrated that NLS-RARalpha could mediate the activity of RAREs that it bound. Together, these results indicated that NLS-RARalpha may be a novel transcription factor that contributes to leukemogenesis by competitively binding RAREs as heterodimers with RXRalpha, just as PML-RARalpha does, thus repressing the gene transcription essential for myeloid differentiation. These findings indicate the potential role of NLS-RARalpha targeted therapy in APL.","['Jiang, Kai-Ling', 'Zhong, Liang', 'Yang, Xiao-Qun', 'Ma, Peng-Peng', 'Wang, Hui', 'Zhu, Xin-Yu', 'Liu, Bei-Zhong']","['Jiang KL', 'Zhong L', 'Yang XQ', 'Ma PP', 'Wang H', 'Zhu XY', 'Liu BZ']","['Central Laboratory of Yongchuan Hospital, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 402160, P.R.

Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) is involved in the modulation of the immune system, particularly in the differentiation of T-helper cell (Th) subsets. Although the NLR family pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome has been implicated as essential in the pathogenesis of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, the role it serves in the development of AML remains unknown. Therefore, in order to identify and describe the possible roles of AHR, as well as NLRP3 inflammasome, in the pathogenesis of AML and their relationship with Th subsets (Th1 Th22), the present study investigated the mRNA expression levels of AHR and NLRP3 inflammasome molecules in the peripheral blood and bone marrow. Concentrations of plasma IL-18 were also investigated in peripheral blood by ELISA, as well as the proportions of Th22 and Th1. In the present study, there were three groups: Newly diagnosed (ND) patients; complete remission (CR); and normal controls. A markedly increased expression of NLRP3 inflammasome molecules in bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMCs) from newly diagnosed (ND) patients compared with patients in complete remission (CR) was identified. NLRP3 inflammasome molecules were also observed to be aberrantly expressed in peripheral blood (PB) mononuclear cells (PBMCs), accompanied with aberrant interleukin (IL)-18 levels in PB plasma. The relative level of IL-18 mRNA became normal after the ND patients with AML achieved CR. In bone marrow, the expression of AHR was significantly higher in ND patients than in CR patients. Furthermore, the expression level of NLRP3 inflammasome molecules was significantly correlated with AHR expression in patients with AML. In the Th subsets, a significantly increased proportion of Th22 in PB from ND patients compared with CR patients or controls was identified, accompanied with decreased Th1. It was concluded that the NLRP3 inflammasome, associated with AHR, was involved in the development of AML and may have influenced the differentiation of Th subsets.","['Jia, Yan', 'Zhang, Chen', 'Hua, Mingqiang', 'Wang, Min', 'Chen, Ping', 'Ma, Daoxin']","['Jia Y', 'Zhang C', 'Hua M', 'Wang M', 'Chen P', 'Ma D']","['Department of Hematology, Qilu Hospital, Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong 250012, P.R.

Hu, and which has been reported by our group to exhibit antitumor activity. Accumulating evidence suggests that the anticancer mechanisms of ZGDHu-1 may be involved indifferent biological activities, particularly in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells. At a high concentration, ZGDHu-1 has been demonstrated to inhibit the proliferation of the leukemia cells by arresting the cell cycle at the G2/M phase, and by inducing cell apoptosis via inducing the accumulation of reactive oxygen species, the translocation of phosphatidylserine across the plasma membrane and the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential. Furthermore, at a low concentration, it was demonstrated to induce the differentiation and degrade the AML1-eight-twenty-one fusion protein in AML cells. Finally, results from a previous study indicate that ZGDHu-1 is a potential proteasome inhibitor. Overall, our preliminary research suggests that ZGDHu-1 may be a promising anticancer drug; however, further research is warranted to identify the exact drug target and potential clinical application in leukemia cells or solid tumors. In the present review, the application of ZGDHu-1 in cancer research, in addition to the specific underlying targets of ZGDHu-1, are discussed.","['Liu, Jinlin', 'Qiu, Liannv', 'Xia, Jun', 'Chen, Sufeng', 'Yu, Xiping', 'Zhou, Yonglie']","['Liu J', 'Qiu L', 'Xia J', 'Chen S', 'Yu X', 'Zhou Y']","[""Department of Clinical Laboratory, Zhejiang Provincial People's Hospital, Hangzhou Medical College, Hangzhou, Zhejiang 310014, P.R.

Identification of these genes and investigation of the downstream effects of their deregulation can reveal disease-causing mechanisms. Case presentation: We report on the molecular characterization of a novel t(12;14)(q23.2;q32.3) in CLL. As a consequence of the rearrangement ASCL1 was brought into proximity of the IGHJ-Cmu enhancer and was highly overexpressed in the aberrant B-cells of the patient, as shown by qPCR and immunohistochemistry. ASCL1 encodes for a transcription factor acting as a master regulator of neurogenesis, is overexpressed in neuroendocrine tumors and a promising therapeutic target in small cell lung cancer (SCLC). Its overexpression has also been recently reported in acute adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma.To examine possible downstream effects of the ASCL1 upregulation in CLL, we compared the gene expression of sorted CD5(+) cells of the translocation patient to that of CD19(+) B-cells from seven healthy donors and detected 176 significantly deregulated genes (Fold Change >/=2, FDR p </= 0.01). Deregulation of 55 genes in our gene set was concordant with at least two studies comparing gene expression of normal and CLL B-lymphocytes. INSM1, a well-established ASCL1 target in the nervous system and SCLC, was the gene with the strongest upregulation (Fold Change = 209.4, FDR p = 1.37E-4).INSM1 encodes for a transcriptional repressor with extranuclear functions, implicated in neuroendocrine differentiation and overexpressed in the majority of neuroendocrine tumors. It was previously shown to be induced in CLL cells but not in normal B-cells upon treatment with IL-4 and to be overexpressed in CLL cells with unmutated versus mutated IGHV genes. Its role in CLL is still unexplored. Conclusion: We identified ASCL1 as a novel IGH-partner gene in CLL. The neural transcription factor was strongly overexpressed in the patient's CLL cells. Microarray gene expression analysis revealed the strong upregulation of INSM1, a prominent ASCL1 target, which was previously shown to be induced in CLL cells upon IL-4 treatment. We propose further investigation of the expression and potential role of INSM1 in CLL.","['Malli, Theodora', 'Rammer, Melanie', 'Haslinger, Sabrina', 'Burghofer, Jonathan', 'Burgstaller, Sonja', 'Boesmueller, Hans-Christian', 'Marschon, Renate', 'Kranewitter, Wolfgang', 'Erdel, Martin', 'Deutschbauer, Sabine', 'Webersinke, Gerald']","['Malli T', 'Rammer M', 'Haslinger S', 'Burghofer J', 'Burgstaller S', 'Boesmueller HC', 'Marschon R', 'Kranewitter W', 'Erdel M', 'Deutschbauer S', 'Webersinke G']","['Laboratory for Molecular Biology and Tumor Cytogenetics, Department of Internal Medicine I, Ordensklinikum Linz GmbH Barmherzige Schwestern, Seilerstaette 4, 4010 Linz, Austria.', 'Laboratory for Molecular Biology and Tumor Cytogenetics, Department of Internal Medicine I, Ordensklinikum Linz GmbH Barmherzige Schwestern, Seilerstaette 4, 4010 Linz, Austria.', 'Laboratory for Molecular Biology and Tumor Cytogenetics, Department of Internal Medicine I, Ordensklinikum Linz GmbH Barmherzige Schwestern, Seilerstaette 4, 4010 Linz, Austria.', 'Laboratory for Molecular Biology and Tumor Cytogenetics, Department of Internal Medicine I, Ordensklinikum Linz GmbH Barmherzige Schwestern, Seilerstaette 4, 4010 Linz, Austria.', '2Department for Internal Medicine IV, Klinikum Wels-Grieskirchen, Grieskirchner Str. 42, 4600 Wels, Austria.0000 0004 0522 7001grid.459707.8', 'Department of Pathology, Ordensklinikum Linz GmbH Barmherzige Schwestern, Seilerstaette 4, 4010 Linz, Austria.', '4Present Address: Institute for Pathology and Neuropathology, University Hospital Tuebingen, Liebermeisterstrasse 8, 72076 Tuebingen, Germany.0000 0001 0196 8249grid.411544.1', 'Laboratory for Molecular Biology and Tumor Cytogenetics, Department of Internal Medicine I, Ordensklinikum Linz GmbH Barmherzige Schwestern, Seilerstaette 4, 4010 Linz, Austria.', 'Laboratory for Molecular Biology and Tumor Cytogenetics, Department of Internal Medicine I, Ordensklinikum Linz GmbH Barmherzige Schwestern, Seilerstaette 4, 4010 Linz, Austria.', 'Laboratory for Molecular Biology and Tumor Cytogenetics, Department of Internal Medicine I, Ordensklinikum Linz GmbH Barmherzige Schwestern, Seilerstaette 4, 4010 Linz, Austria.', 'Laboratory for Molecular Biology and Tumor Cytogenetics, Department of Internal Medicine I, Ordensklinikum Linz GmbH Barmherzige Schwestern, Seilerstaette 4, 4010 Linz, Austria.', 'Laboratory for Molecular Biology and Tumor Cytogenetics, Department of Internal Medicine I, Ordensklinikum Linz GmbH Barmherzige Schwestern, Seilerstaette 4, 4010 Linz, Austria.']",['eng'],,['Case Reports'],20180111,England,Mol Cytogenet,Molecular cytogenetics,101317942,PMC5765657,['NOTNLM'],"['ASCL1 overexpression', 'Chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'Expression microarray', 'IGH translocation', 'INSM1']",2018/01/19 06:00,2018/01/19 06:01,['2018/01/19 06:00'],"['2017/12/04 00:00 [received]', '2018/01/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/01/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/19 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13039-018-0355-7 [doi]', '355 [pii]']",epublish,Mol Cytogenet. 2018 Jan 11;11:3. doi: 10.1186/s13039-018-0355-7. eCollection 2018.,,,,,,['ORCID: 0000-0001-5654-6190'],,"['Gene expression analysis in CLL patients was approved by the ethics and research', 'committee of the Ordensklinikum Linz, Barmherzige Schwestern (No. 2709).

The peripheral blood picture is variable, with anaemia, neutropenia and/or thrombocytopenia, and the patients with idiopathic BMFS/AA may have a risk of transformation into a myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and/or an acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), as ascertained for all inherited BMFS. We already reported four patients with different forms of BMFS/AA with chromosome anomalies as primary etiologic event: the chromosome changes exerted an effect on specific genes, namely RUNX1, MPL, and FLI1, leading to the disease. Results: We report two further patients with non-hereditary BM failure, with diagnosis of severe aplastic anaemia and pancytopenia caused by two different constitutional structural anomalies involving chromosome 8, and possibly leading to the disorder due to effects on the RUNX1T1 gene, which was hypo-expressed and hyper-expressed, respectively, in the two patients. The chromosome change was unbalanced in one patient, and balanced in the other one. Conclusions: We analyzed the sequence of events in the pathogenesis of the disease in the two patients, including a number of non-haematological signs present in the one with the unbalanced anomaly. We demonstrated that in these two patients the primary event causing BMFS/AA was the constitutional chromosome anomaly. If we take into account the cohort of 219 patients with a similar diagnosis in whom we made cytogenetic studies in the years 2003-2017, we conclude that cytogenetic investigations were instrumental to reach a diagnosis in 52 of them. We postulate that a chromosome change is the primary cause of BMFS/AA in a not negligible proportion of cases, as it was ascertained in 6 of these patients.","['Valli, R', 'Vinti, L', 'Frattini, A', 'Fabbri, M', 'Montalbano, G', 'Olivieri, C', 'Minelli, A', 'Locatelli, F', 'Pasquali, F', 'Maserati, E']","['Valli R', 'Vinti L', 'Frattini A', 'Fabbri M', 'Montalbano G', 'Olivieri C', 'Minelli A', 'Locatelli F', 'Pasquali F', 'Maserati E']","[""1Genetica Umana e Medica, Dipartimento di Medicina e Chirurgia, Universita dell'Insubria, Varese, Italy.0000000121724807grid.18147.3b"", '2Dipartimento di Onco-Ematologia Pediatrica, Ospedale Pediatrico Bambino Gesu, Roma, Universita di Pavia, Pavia, Italy.0000 0004 1762 5736grid.8982.b', ""1Genetica Umana e Medica, Dipartimento di Medicina e Chirurgia, Universita dell'Insubria, Varese, Italy.0000000121724807grid.18147.3b"", '3Istituto di Ricerca Genetica e Biomedica, CNR, Milan, Italy.0000 0001 1940 4177grid.5326.2', ""1Genetica Umana e Medica, Dipartimento di Medicina e Chirurgia, Universita dell'Insubria, Varese, Italy.0000000121724807grid.18147.3b"", '4Unit of Haematopathology, European Institute of Oncology, Milan, Italy.0000 0004 1757 0843grid.15667.33', ""1Genetica Umana e Medica, Dipartimento di Medicina e Chirurgia, Universita dell'Insubria, Varese, Italy.0000000121724807grid.18147.3b"", '5Genetica Medica, Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico S.

This study aimed to investigate potential pathways and genes associated with TP53 mutations in adult de novo AML. Methods: An RNA sequencing dataset of adult de novo AML was downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas database. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified by edgeR of the R platform. Key pathways and genes were identified using the following bioinformatics tools: gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), gene ontology (GO), the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins, and Molecular Complex Detection. Results: GSEA suggested that TP53 mutations were significantly associated with cell differentiation, proliferation, cell adhesion biological processes, and MAPK pathway. In total, 1,287 genes were identified as DEGs. GO and KEGG analysis suggested that upregulation of DEGs was significantly enriched in categories associated with cell adhesion biological processes, Ras-associated protein 1, PI3K-Akt pathway, and cell adhesion molecules. The top ten genes ranked by degree, CDH1, BMP2, KDR, LEP, CASR, ITGA2B, APOE, MNX1, NMU, and TRH, were identified as hub genes from the protein-protein interaction network. Survival analysis suggested that patients with TP53 mutations had a significantly increased risk of death, while the mRNA expression level in patients with TP53 mutation was similar to those carrying TP53 wild type.

Advances in genomic technologies have increasingly shown the complexity and heterogeneity of genetic and epigenetic alterations in AML. Among the genetic alterations occurring in AML, frequent are the genetic alterations at the level of various genes involved in the epigenetic control of the DNA methylome and histone methylome. In fact, genes involved in DNA demethylation (such as DNMT3A, TET2, IDH1, and IDH2) or histone methylation and demethylation (EZH2, MLL, DOT1L) are frequently mutated in primary and secondary AML. Furthermore, some histone demethylases, such as LSD1, are frequently overexpressed in AML. These observations have strongly supported a major role of dysregulated epigenetic regulatory processes in leukemia onset and development. This conclusion was further supported by the observation that mutations in genes encoding epigenetic modifiers, such as DMT3A, ASXL1, TET2, IDH1, and IDH2, are usually acquired early and are present in the founding leukemic clone. These observations have contributed to development of the idea that targeting epigenetic abnormalities could represent a potentially promising strategy for the development of innovative treatments of AML. In this review, we analyze those proteins and their inhibitors that have already reached the first stages of clinical trials in AML, namely the histone methyltransferase DOT1L, the demethylase LSD1, and the MLL-interacting protein menin.","['Castelli, Germana', 'Pelosi, Elvira', 'Testa, Ugo']","['Castelli G', 'Pelosi E', 'Testa U']","['Department of Oncology, Istituto Superiore di Sanita, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Oncology, Istituto Superiore di Sanita, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Oncology, Istituto Superiore di Sanita, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20171228,New Zealand,Onco Targets Ther,OncoTargets and therapy,101514322,PMC5749389,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'demethylases', 'epigenetic modifications', 'methyltransferases']",2018/01/19 06:00,2018/01/19 06:01,['2018/01/19 06:00'],"['2018/01/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/01/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/19 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/OTT.S145971 [doi]', 'ott-11-131 [pii]']",epublish,Onco Targets Ther. 2017 Dec 28;11:131-155. doi: 10.2147/OTT.S145971. eCollection 2018.,,,,,,,,['Disclosure The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite the wide use of ANS, it is associated with serious side effects due to uncontrolled delivery. In addition, ANS exhibits low solubility and short plasma half-life. Nanotechnology-based drug delivery has the potential to enhance the efficacy of drugs and overcome undesirable side effects. In this study, we aimed to prepare novel ANS-loaded PLA-PEG-PLA nanoparticles (ANS-NPs) and to compare the apoptotic response of MCF-7 cell line to both ANS and ANS-loaded NPs. Method: ANS-NPs were synthesized using double emulsion method and characterized using different methods. The apoptotic response was evaluated by assessing cell viability, morphology, and studying changes in the expression of MAPK3, MCL1, and c-MYC apoptotic genes in MCF-7 cell lines. Results: ANS was successfully encapsulated within PLA-PEG-PLA, forming monodisperse therapeutic NPs with an encapsulation efficiency of 67%, particle size of 186+/-27.13, and a polydispersity index of 0.26+/-0.11 with a sustained release profile extended over 144 hours. In addition, results for cell viability and for gene expression represent a similar apoptotic response between the free ANS and ANS-NPs. Conclusion: The synthesized ANS-NPs showed a similar therapeutic effect as the free ANS, which provides a rationale to pursue pre-clinical evaluation of ANS-NPs on animal models.","['Alyafee, Yusra A', 'Alaamery, Manal', 'Bawazeer, Shahad', 'Almutairi, Mansour S', 'Alghamdi, Badr', 'Alomran, Nawaf', 'Sheereen, Atia', 'Daghestani, Maha', 'Massadeh, Salam']","['Alyafee YA', 'Alaamery M', 'Bawazeer S', 'Almutairi MS', 'Alghamdi B', 'Alomran N', 'Sheereen A', 'Daghestani M', 'Massadeh S']","['Developmental Medicine Department, King Abdullah International Medical Research Center, King Saud Bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences, King AbdulAziz Medical City, Ministry of National Guard Health Affairs, Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Zoology/College of Science/King Saud University (KSU), Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.', 'Developmental Medicine Department, King Abdullah International Medical Research Center, King Saud Bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences, King AbdulAziz Medical City, Ministry of National Guard Health Affairs, Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.', 'Developmental Medicine Department, King Abdullah International Medical Research Center, King Saud Bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences, King AbdulAziz Medical City, Ministry of National Guard Health Affairs, Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.', 'Developmental Medicine Department, King Abdullah International Medical Research Center, King Saud Bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences, King AbdulAziz Medical City, Ministry of National Guard Health Affairs, Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.', 'Developmental Medicine Department, King Abdullah International Medical Research Center, King Saud Bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences, King AbdulAziz Medical City, Ministry of National Guard Health Affairs, Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.', 'Developmental Medicine Department, King Abdullah International Medical Research Center, King Saud Bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences, King AbdulAziz Medical City, Ministry of National Guard Health Affairs, Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.', 'Developmental Medicine Department, King Abdullah International Medical Research Center, King Saud Bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences, King AbdulAziz Medical City, Ministry of National Guard Health Affairs, Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Zoology/College of Science/King Saud University (KSU), Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.', 'Developmental Medicine Department, King Abdullah International Medical Research Center, King Saud Bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences, King AbdulAziz Medical City, Ministry of National Guard Health Affairs, Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.', 'College of Pharmacy, King Saud bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences, King Abdullah International Medical Research Center, King Abdulaziz Medical City, Ministry of National Guard, Health Affairs, Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20171228,New Zealand,Int J Nanomedicine,International journal of nanomedicine,101263847,PMC5749378,['NOTNLM'],"['PLA-PEG-PLA', 'anastrozole', 'anti-apoptosis', 'gene expression', 'therapeutic nanoparticles']",2018/01/19 06:00,2018/03/27 06:00,['2018/01/19 06:00'],"['2018/01/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/01/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/27 06:00 [medline]']","['10.2147/IJN.S151139 [doi]', 'ijn-13-199 [pii]']",epublish,Int J Nanomedicine. 2017 Dec 28;13:199-208. doi: 10.2147/IJN.S151139. eCollection 2018.,20180326,,"['0 (Aromatase Inhibitors)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Polyesters)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Triazoles)', '0 (polylactide-polyethylene glycol-polylactide)', '2Z07MYW1AZ (Anastrozole)', '3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Anastrozole', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/genetics', 'Aromatase Inhibitors/*administration & dosage/chemistry', 'Breast Neoplasms/drug therapy/genetics', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Drug Delivery Systems/methods', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Half-Life', 'Humans', 'MCF-7 Cells', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3/genetics', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/genetics', 'Nanoparticles/*administration & dosage/chemistry', 'Nitriles/*administration & dosage/chemistry', 'Particle Size', 'Polyesters/chemistry', 'Polyethylene Glycols/chemistry', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/genetics', 'Solubility', 'Triazoles/*administration & dosage/chemistry']",,,['Disclosure The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although methods for detection of fusion genes, such as fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), have been developed in last two decades, these methods are not ideal for detection of these genetic alterations owing to their high cost and time-consuming procedures. In this study, we developed novel application for detection of gene translocations using loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP). We verified the amplified DNA products of echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (EML4-ALK), synaptotagmin and synovial sarcoma, X breakpoint (SYT-SSX), and immunoglobulin heavy chain gene and B cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 (IgH/BCL2) by real-time PCR, agarose-gel electrophoresis, and the naked eye after the LAMP procedure. Fusion genes were detected in samples diluted 10(3) times within 60 min. Because of the advantages of rapid amplification, simple operation, and easy detection without requiring sophisticated equipment or technical skill, LAMP may have potential applications as an on-site analytical approach in hospitals for pathological diagnosis and decision making regarding appropriate therapeutic approachs.","['Matsuzaki, Ibu', 'Iguchi, Hideto', 'Mikasa, Yurina', 'Morishita, Hiromu', 'Okuda, Katsuya', 'Nakaguchi, Keita', 'Mori, Yuki', 'Iwahashi, Yoshifumi', 'Warigaya, Kenji', 'Fujimoto, Masakazu', 'Kojima, Fumiyoshi', 'Murata, Shin-Ichi']","['Matsuzaki I', 'Iguchi H', 'Mikasa Y', 'Morishita H', 'Okuda K', 'Nakaguchi K', 'Mori Y', 'Iwahashi Y', 'Warigaya K', 'Fujimoto M', 'Kojima F', 'Murata SI']","['Department of Human Pathology, Wakayama Medical University, 811-1 Kimiidera, Wakayama 641-8509, Japan.', 'Department of Human Pathology, Wakayama Medical University, 811-1 Kimiidera, Wakayama 641-8509, Japan.', 'Department of Human Pathology, Wakayama Medical University, 811-1 Kimiidera, Wakayama 641-8509, Japan.', 'Department of Human Pathology, Wakayama Medical University, 811-1 Kimiidera, Wakayama 641-8509, Japan.', 'Department of Human Pathology, Wakayama Medical University, 811-1 Kimiidera, Wakayama 641-8509, Japan.', 'Department of Human Pathology, Wakayama Medical University, 811-1 Kimiidera, Wakayama 641-8509, Japan.', 'Department of Human Pathology, Wakayama Medical University, 811-1 Kimiidera, Wakayama 641-8509, Japan.', 'Department of Human Pathology, Wakayama Medical University, 811-1 Kimiidera, Wakayama 641-8509, Japan.', 'Department of Human Pathology, Wakayama Medical University, 811-1 Kimiidera, Wakayama 641-8509, Japan.', 'Department of Human Pathology, Wakayama Medical University, 811-1 Kimiidera, Wakayama 641-8509, Japan.', 'Department of Human Pathology, Wakayama Medical University, 811-1 Kimiidera, Wakayama 641-8509, Japan.', 'Department of Human Pathology, Wakayama Medical University, 811-1 Kimiidera, Wakayama 641-8509, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20171207,Japan,Acta Histochem Cytochem,Acta histochemica et cytochemica,0147110,PMC5765217,['NOTNLM'],"['X breakpoint', 'echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 and anaplastic lymphoma kinase;', 'synaptotagmin and synovial sarcoma', 'gene translocation', 'immunoglobulin heavy chain gene and B cell leukemia/lymphoma 2', 'loop-mediated isothermal amplification']",2018/01/19 06:00,2018/01/19 06:01,['2018/01/19 06:00'],"['2017/08/23 00:00 [received]', '2017/11/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/01/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/19 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1267/ahc.17024 [doi]', 'JST.JSTAGE/ahc/17024 [pii]']",ppublish,Acta Histochem Cytochem. 2017 Dec 26;50(6):169-176. doi: 10.1267/ahc.17024.

Furthermore, short - term treatment of the AML LSCs with these MSNs before transplant significantly delayed leukemia development in recipient mice. These data demonstrate that targeting of AML LSCs can be improved by using functionalized and antigen directed MSNs as carriers for anti-leukemic drugs.","['Mandal, Tamoghna', 'Beck, Michaela', 'Kirsten, Nicole', 'Linden, Mika', 'Buske, Christian']","['Mandal T', 'Beck M', 'Kirsten N', 'Linden M', 'Buske C']","['Institute for Experimental Cancer Research, CCC and University Hospital of Ulm, Albert-Einstein-Allee 11, 89081, Ulm, Germany.', 'Institute for Inorganic Chemistry II, University of Ulm, Albert-Einstein-Allee 11, 89081, Ulm, Germany.', 'Institute for Experimental Cancer Research, CCC and University Hospital of Ulm, Albert-Einstein-Allee 11, 89081, Ulm, Germany.', 'Institute for Inorganic Chemistry II, University of Ulm, Albert-Einstein-Allee 11, 89081, Ulm, Germany. christian.buske@uni-ulm.de.', 'Institute for Experimental Cancer Research, CCC and University Hospital of Ulm, Albert-Einstein-Allee 11, 89081, Ulm, Germany. mika.linden@uni-ulm.de.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180117,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,PMC5772366,,,2018/01/19 06:00,2018/11/24 06:00,['2018/01/19 06:00'],"['2017/06/07 00:00 [received]', '2017/12/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/01/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/11/24 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-017-18932-4 [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-017-18932-4 [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2018 Jan 17;8(1):989. doi: 10.1038/s41598-017-18932-4.,20181123,1,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Succinic Anhydrides)', '6RF4O17Z8J (succinic anhydride)', '7631-86-9 (Silicon Dioxide)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*chemistry', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Daunorubicin/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Drug Compounding/methods', 'Gene Expression', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/metabolism/pathology/*therapy', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Nanoparticles/administration & dosage/*chemistry/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Neoplasms, Experimental', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Protein Binding', 'Silicon Dioxide/*chemistry', 'Succinic Anhydrides/chemistry', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

29343814,NLM,MEDLINE,20190617,2041-4889 (Electronic),9,2018 Jan 17,Intrinsic apoptotic pathway activation increases response to anti-estrogens in luminal breast cancers.,21,10.1038/s41419-017-0072-x [doi],"Estrogen receptor-alpha positive (ERalpha+) breast cancer accounts for approximately 70-80% of the nearly 25,0000 new cases of breast cancer diagnosed in the US each year. Endocrine-targeted therapies (those that block ERalpha activity) serve as the first line of treatment in most cases. Despite the proven benefit of endocrine therapies, however, ERalpha+ breast tumors can develop resistance to endocrine therapy, causing disease progression or relapse, particularly in the metastatic setting. Anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins enhance breast tumor cell survival, often promoting resistance to targeted therapies, including endocrine therapies. Herein, we investigated whether blockade of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins could sensitize luminal breast cancers to anti-estrogen treatment. We used long-term estrogen deprivation (LTED) of human ERalpha+ breast cancer cell lines, an established model of sustained treatment with and acquired resistance to aromatase inhibitors (AIs), in combination with Bcl-2/Bcl-xL inhibition (ABT-263), finding that ABT-263 induced only limited tumor cell killing in LTED-selected cells in culture and in vivo. Interestingly, expression and activity of the Bcl-2-related factor Mcl-1 was increased in LTED cells. Genetic Mcl-1 ablation induced apoptosis in LTED-selected cells, and potently increased their sensitivity to ABT-263. Increased expression and activity of Mcl-1 was similarly seen in clinical breast tumor specimens treated with AI + the selective estrogen receptor downregulator fulvestrant. Delivery of Mcl-1 siRNA loaded into polymeric nanoparticles (MCL1 si-NPs) decreased Mcl-1 expression in LTED-selected and fulvestrant-treated cells, increasing tumor cell death and blocking tumor cell growth. These findings suggest that Mcl-1 upregulation in response to anti-estrogen treatment enhances tumor cell survival, decreasing response to therapeutic treatments. Therefore, strategies blocking Mcl-1 expression or activity used in combination with endocrine therapies would enhance tumor cell death.","['Williams, Michelle M', 'Lee, Linus', 'Werfel, Thomas', 'Joly, Meghan M Morrison', 'Hicks, Donna J', 'Rahman, Bushra', 'Elion, David', 'McKernan, Courtney', 'Sanchez, Violeta', 'Estrada, Monica V', 'Massarweh, Suleiman', 'Elledge, Richard', 'Duvall, Craig', 'Cook, Rebecca S']","['Williams MM', 'Lee L', 'Werfel T', 'Joly MMM', 'Hicks DJ', 'Rahman B', 'Elion D', 'McKernan C', 'Sanchez V', 'Estrada MV', 'Massarweh S', 'Elledge R', 'Duvall C', 'Cook RS']","['Department of Cancer Biology, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN, USA.', 'Department of Biomedical Engineering, Vanderbilt University School of Engineering, Nashville, TN, USA.', 'Department of Biomedical Engineering, Vanderbilt University School of Engineering, Nashville, TN, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA.', 'Cancer Therapy and Research Center, University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio, TX, USA.', 'Department of Biomedical Engineering, Vanderbilt University School of Engineering, Nashville, TN, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN, USA.

Here, we demonstrate that, in contrast to MLL-rearranged leukemia, DOT1L plays a protective role in ultraviolet radiation (UVR)-induced melanoma development. Specifically, the DOT1L gene is located in a frequently deleted region and undergoes somatic mutation in human melanoma. Specific mutations functionally compromise DOT1L methyltransferase enzyme activity leading to reduced H3K79 methylation. Importantly, in the absence of DOT1L, UVR-induced DNA damage is inefficiently repaired, so that DOT1L loss promotes melanoma development in mice after exposure to UVR.

The transcription factor GATA-2 is expressed in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells and is essential for cell proliferation and differentiation. Heterozygous germline GATA2 mutations induce GATA-2 deficiency syndrome, characterized by monocytopenia, a predisposition to myelodysplasia and acute myeloid leukemia, and a profoundly reduced dendritic cell (DC) population, which is associated with increased susceptibility to viral infections. Because patients with GATA-2 deficiency syndrome could retain a wild-type copy of GATA-2, boosting residual wild-type GATA-2 activity may represent a novel therapeutic strategy for the disease. Here, we sought to establish a screening system to identify GATA-2 activators using human U937 monocytic cells as a potential model of the DC progenitor. Enforced GATA-2 expression in U937 cells induces CD205 expression, a marker of DC differentiation, indicating U937 cells as a surrogate of human primary DC progenitors. Transient luciferase reporter assays in U937 cells reveals a high promoter activity of the -0.5 kb GATA-2 hematopoietic-specific promoter (1S promoter) fused with two tandemly connected GATA-2 +9.9 kb intronic enhancers. We thus established U937-derived cell lines stably expressing tandem +9.9 kb/-0.5 kb 1S-luciferase. Importantly, forced GATA-1 expression, a repressor for GATA-2 expression, in the stable clones caused significant decreases in the luciferase activities. In conclusion, our system represents a potential tool for identifying novel regulators of GATA-2, thereby contributing to the development of novel therapeutic approaches.","['Ohashi, Keiichi', 'Fujiwara, Tohru', 'Onodera, Koichi', 'Saito, Yo', 'Ichikawa, Satoshi', 'Kobayashi, Masahiro', 'Okitsu, Yoko', 'Fukuhara, Noriko', 'Onishi, Yasushi', 'Harigae, Hideo']","['Ohashi K', 'Fujiwara T', 'Onodera K', 'Saito Y', 'Ichikawa S', 'Kobayashi M', 'Okitsu Y', 'Fukuhara N', 'Onishi Y', 'Harigae H']","['Department of Hematology and Rheumatology, Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine.', 'Department of Hematology and Rheumatology, Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine.', 'Department of Hematology and Rheumatology, Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine.', 'Department of Hematology and Rheumatology, Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine.', 'Department of Hematology and Rheumatology, Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine.', 'Department of Hematology and Rheumatology, Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine.', 'Department of Hematology and Rheumatology, Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine.', 'Department of Hematology and Rheumatology, Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine.', 'Department of Hematology and Rheumatology, Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine.', 'Department of Hematology and Rheumatology, Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Japan,Tohoku J Exp Med,The Tohoku journal of experimental medicine,0417355,,['NOTNLM'],"['GATA-1', 'GATA-2', 'GATA-2 deficiency syndrome', 'U937', 'dendritic cells']",2018/01/19 06:00,2018/08/11 06:00,['2018/01/19 06:00'],"['2018/01/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/01/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/08/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1620/tjem.244.41 [doi]'],ppublish,Tohoku J Exp Med. 2018 Jan;244(1):41-52. doi: 10.1620/tjem.244.41.,20180810,1,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (GATA2 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Immune Sera)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)']",IM,"['Base Pairing/genetics', 'Biomarkers/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Clone Cells', 'Dendritic Cells/metabolism', 'GATA2 Transcription Factor/*genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation', '*Genetic Testing', 'Humans', 'Immune Sera/metabolism', 'Luciferases/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', '*Transcription, Genetic']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The enzyme drug l-asparaginase serves as a cornerstone of ALL therapy and exploits the asparagine dependency of ALL cells. In addition to hydrolyzing the amino acid l-asparagine, all FDA-approved l-asparaginases also have significant l-glutaminase coactivity. Since several reports suggest that l-glutamine depletion correlates with many of the side effects of these drugs, enzyme variants with reduced l-glutaminase coactivity might be clinically beneficial if their antileukemic activity would be preserved. Here we show that novel low l-glutaminase variants developed on the backbone of the FDA-approved Erwinia chrysanthemi l-asparaginase were highly efficacious against both T- and B-cell ALL, while displaying reduced acute toxicity features. These results support the development of a new generation of safer l-asparaginases without l-glutaminase activity for the treatment of human ALL.Significance: A new l-asparaginase-based therapy is less toxic compared with FDA-approved high l-glutaminase enzymes Cancer Res; 78(6); 1549-60.

We previously identified NR4A1 and NR4A3 (NR4A1/3) as functionally redundant suppressors of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) development. However, their role in hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) homeostasis remains to be disclosed. Using a conditional Nr4a1/Nr4a3 knockout mouse (CDKO), we show that codepletion of NR4A1/3 promotes acute changes in HSC homeostasis including loss of HSC quiescence, accumulation of oxidative stress, and DNA damage while maintaining stem cell regenerative and differentiation capacity. Molecular profiling of CDKO HSCs revealed widespread upregulation of genetic programs governing cell cycle and inflammation and an aberrant activation of the interferon and NF-kappaB signaling pathways in the absence of stimuli. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that NR4A1/3 restrict HSC proliferation in part through activation of a C/EBPalpha-driven antiproliferative network by directly binding to a hematopoietic-specific Cebpa enhancer and activating Cebpa transcription. In addition, NR4A1/3 occupy the regulatory regions of NF-kappaB-regulated inflammatory cytokines, antagonizing the activation of NF-kappaB signaling. Taken together, our results reveal a novel coordinate control of HSC quiescence by NR4A1/3 through direct activation of C/EBPalpha and suppression of activation of NF-kappaB-driven proliferative inflammatory responses.","['Freire, Pablo R', 'Conneely, Orla M']","['Freire PR', 'Conneely OM']","['Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX.']",['eng'],"['P30 CA125123/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA160747/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20180117,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,PMC5863701,,,2018/01/19 06:00,2019/03/20 06:00,['2018/01/19 06:00'],"['2017/07/11 00:00 [received]', '2018/01/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/20 06:00 [medline]', '2018/01/19 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)32416-2 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2017-07-795757 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2018 Mar 8;131(10):1081-1093. doi: 10.1182/blood-2017-07-795757.

The genetic events underlying oncogenesis in NPM1-mutated AML that is characterized by a normal karyotype remain unclear. Inositol polyphosphate 4-phosphatase type II (INPP4B), a new factor in the phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K) pathway-associated cancers, has been recently found a clinically relevant role in AML. However, little is known about the specific mechanistic function of INPP4B in NPM1-mutated AML. METHODS: The INPP4B expression levels in NPM1-mutated AML primary blasts and AML OCI-AML3 cell lines were determined by qRT-PCR and western blotting. The effect of INPP4B knockdown on OCI-AML3 leukemia cell proliferation was evaluated, using the Cell Counting Kit-8 and colony formation assay. After INPP4B overexpression or knockdown, the activation of serum and glucocorticoid-regulated kinase 3 (SGK3) and AKT was assessed. The effects of PI3K signaling pathway inhibitors on the levels of p-SGK3 in OCI-AML3 cells were tested. The mass of PI (3,4) P2 and PI (3) P was analyzed by ELISA upon INPP4B overexpression. Knockdown of SGK3 by RNA interference and a rescue assay were performed to confirm the critical role of SGK3 in INPP4B-mediated cell survival. In addition, the molecular mechanism underlying INPP4B expression in NPM1-mutated leukemia cells was explored. Finally, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was conducted on the NPM1-mutated AML cohort stratified into quartiles for INPP4B expression in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset. RESULTS: High expression of INPP4B was observed in NPM1-mutated AML. Knockdown of INPP4B repressed cell proliferation in OCI-AML3 cells, whereas recovered INPP4B rescued this inhibitory effect in vitro. Mechanically, INPP4B enhanced phosphorylated SGK3 (p-SGK3) status, but did not affect AKT activation. SGK3 was required for INPP4B-induced cell proliferation in OCI-AML3 cells. High levels of INPP4B were at least partially caused by the NPM1 mutant via ERK/Ets-1 signaling. Finally, high expression of INPP4B showed a trend towards lower overall survival and event-free survival in NPM1-mutated AML patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that INPP4B promotes leukemia cell survival via SGK3 activation, and INPP4B might be a potential target in the treatment of NPM1-mutated AML.","['Jin, Hongjun', 'Yang, Liyuan', 'Wang, Lu', 'Yang, Zailin', 'Zhan, Qian', 'Tao, Yao', 'Zou, Qin', 'Tang, Yuting', 'Xian, Jingrong', 'Zhang, Shuaishuai', 'Jing, Yipei', 'Zhang, Ling']","['Jin H', 'Yang L', 'Wang L', 'Yang Z', 'Zhan Q', 'Tao Y', 'Zou Q', 'Tang Y', 'Xian J', 'Zhang S', 'Jing Y', 'Zhang L']","['Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medical Diagnostics Designated by the Ministry of Education, School of Laboratory Medicine, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400016, China.

Dasatinib-induced pulmonary hypertension has been reported in less than 1% of patients on chronic dasatinib treatment for chronic myelogenous leukemia. The pulmonary arterial hypertension from dasatinib may be categorized as either group 1 (drug-induced) or group 5 based on various mechanisms that may be involved including the pathogenesis of the disease process of chronic myelogenous leukemia. There have been reports of dasatinib-induced pulmonary arterial hypertension being reversible. We report a case of pulmonary arterial hypertension in a 46-year-old female patient with chronic phase chronic myelogenous leukemia on dasatinib treatment for over 10 years.

Despite different sites of cryptococcal infection, both patients had similar presentations of acute illness. Patient 1 was worked up for health care-associated pneumonia, as well as acute sinusitis prior to the diagnosis of cryptococcal meningoencephalitis.

Methods: The proliferation inhibition effect of SAHA on chronic myeloid leukemia K562 cell was detected by MTS method, and the optimal concentration of SAHA reaction was determined. Western blot was used to detect the level of PARP protein, and making sure whether SAHA induced apoptosis of K562 cell. Effect of SAHA on Bcr-Abl Gene Transcription in K562 Cells was determined by Fluorescence Quantitative PCR. The online software Target Scan and real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR was used to screen Bcr-Abl-targeted microRNA. The viability of K562 cells and Bcr-Abl transcription levels were detected by MTS method and quantitative PCR respectively after selected microRNA were transfected into K562 cell. Results: SAHA significantly inhibited the proliferation of K562 cells and induced apoptosis, meanwhile SAHA significantly down-regulated the transcriptional level of Bcr-Abl gene. After treatment of K562 cells with SAHA, two microRNA, miR-192 and miR-6816, which could target Bcr-Abl, were screened by Target Scan and quantitative PCR. Additionally, SAHA induced the miRNAs to up-regulate 14.5 and 5.2 times, respectively. Transfection of miR-192 and miR-6816 to K562 cells significantly inhibited K562 cell viability and down-regulated the transcriptional level of Bcr-Abl gene. Conclusion: Acetylation inhibitor SAHA promoted the expression of miR-192 and miR-6816 in K562 cells by acetylation regulation, miR-192 and miR-6816 further down-regulated the transcription of Bcr-Abl gene, thereby inhibiting K562 cell proliferation and induced apoptosis.","['Ai, Z D', 'Wu, H Y', 'Chen, L']","['Ai ZD', 'Wu HY', 'Chen L']","['Department of Basic Medicine, Medical School, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming 650500, China.']",['chi'],,['Journal Article'],,China,Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua yi xue za zhi,7511141,,['NOTNLM'],"['Apoptosis', 'Bcr-Abl', 'Cell proliferation', 'Chronic myeloid leukemia', 'MicroRNA']",2018/01/19 06:00,2018/12/12 06:00,['2018/01/19 06:00'],"['2018/01/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/01/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/12/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3760/cma.j.issn.0376-2491.2018.01.010 [doi]'],ppublish,Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi. 2018 Jan 2;98(1):46-50. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.issn.0376-2491.2018.01.010.,20181211,1,"['0 (MicroRNAs)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl', 'Genes, abl', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', '*Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive', 'MicroRNAs']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The primary AML cells express various integrins. These heterodimeric molecules containing an alpha and a beta chain are cell surface molecules that bind extracellular matrix molecules, cell surface molecules and soluble mediators. The beta3 integrin (ITGB3) chain can form heterodimers only with the two alpha chains alphaIIb and alphaV. These integrins are among the most promiscuous and bind to a large number of ligands, including extracellular matrix molecules, cell surface molecules and soluble mediators. Recent studies suggest that the two beta3 integrins are important for leukemogenesis and chemosensitivity in human AML. Firstly, alphaIIb and beta3 are both important for adhesion of AML cells to vitronectin and fibronectin. Secondly, beta3 is important for the development of murine AML and also for the homing and maintenance of the proliferation for xenografted primary human AML cells, and for maintaining a stem cell transcriptional program. These last effects seem to be mediated through Syk kinase. The beta3 expression seems to be regulated by HomeboxA9 (HoxA9) and HoxA10, and the increased beta3 expression then activates spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) and thereby contributes to cytokine hypersensitivity and activation of beta2 integrins. Finally, high integrin alphaV/beta3 expression is associated with an adverse prognosis in AML and decreased sensitivity to the kinase inhibitor sorafenib; this integrin can also be essential for osteopontin-induced sorafenib resistance in AML. In the present article, we review the experimental and clinical evidence for a role of beta3 integrins for leukemogenesis and chemosensitivity in AML.","['Johansen, Silje', 'Brenner, Annette K', 'Bartaula-Brevik, Sushma', 'Reikvam, Hakon', 'Bruserud, Oystein']","['Johansen S', 'Brenner AK', 'Bartaula-Brevik S', 'Reikvam H', 'Bruserud O']","['Section for Hematology, Department of Medicine, Haukeland University Hospital, N-5021 Bergen, Norway. silje.johansen@helse-bergen.no.', 'Section for Hematology, Department of Medicine, Haukeland University Hospital, N-5021 Bergen, Norway. annette.brenner@k2.uib.no.', 'Section for Hematology, Institute of Clinical Science, University of Bergen, 5007 Bergen, Norway. annette.brenner@k2.uib.no.', 'Section for Hematology, Institute of Clinical Science, University of Bergen, 5007 Bergen, Norway. sushma.bartaula@iko.uib.no.', 'Section for Hematology, Department of Medicine, Haukeland University Hospital, N-5021 Bergen, Norway. hakon.reikvam@k2.uib.no.', 'Section for Hematology, Institute of Clinical Science, University of Bergen, 5007 Bergen, Norway. hakon.reikvam@k2.uib.no.', 'Section for Hematology, Department of Medicine, Haukeland University Hospital, N-5021 Bergen, Norway.

During such expansion, NK cells are increasingly activated and more efficient at killing cancer cells. Adoptive transfer however introduces these activated cells into a highly immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment mediated in part by excessive transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) from both cancer cells and their surrounding stroma. This microenvironment ultimately limits the clinical efficacy of NK cell therapy. In this study, we examined the use of a TGF-beta receptor kinase inhibitor, LY2157299, in preserving the cytotoxic function of ex vivo expanded, highly activated NK cells following sustained exposure to pathologic levels of TGF-beta in vitro and in a liver metastases model of colon cancer. Using myeloid leukemia and colon cancer cell lines, we show that the TGF-beta driven impairment of NK cell cytotoxicity is mitigated by LY2157299. We demonstrate this effect using quantitative cytotoxicity assays as well as by showing a preserved activated phenotype with high NKG2D/CD16 expression and enhanced cytokine production. In a mouse liver metastases model of colon cancer, we observed significantly improved eradication of liver metastases in mice treated with adoptive NK cells combined with LY2157299 compared with mice receiving NK cells or TGF beta inhibition alone. We propose that the therapeutic efficacy of adoptive NK cell therapy clinically will be markedly enhanced by complementary approaches targeting TGF-beta signaling in vivo.","['Otegbeye, Folashade', 'Ojo, Evelyn', 'Moreton, Stephen', 'Mackowski, Nathan', 'Lee, Dean A', 'de Lima, Marcos', 'Wald, David N']","['Otegbeye F', 'Ojo E', 'Moreton S', 'Mackowski N', 'Lee DA', 'de Lima M', 'Wald DN']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center, Cleveland, Ohio, United States of America.', 'Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio, United States of America.', 'Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio, United States of America.', 'Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio, United States of America.', 'Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio, United States of America.', ""Nationwide Children's Hospital Division of Hematology/Oncology, Columbus, Ohio, United States of America."", 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center, Cleveland, Ohio, United States of America.', 'Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio, United States of America.', 'Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio, United States of America.', 'Department of Pathology, University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center, Cleveland, Ohio, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['S10 OD021559/OD/NIH HHS/United States', 'TL1 TR002549/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA150964/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'TL1 TR000441/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA043703/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM007250/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180117,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,PMC5771627,,,2018/01/18 06:00,2018/02/27 06:00,['2018/01/18 06:00'],"['2017/03/10 00:00 [received]', '2018/01/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/01/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/27 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0191358 [doi]', 'PONE-D-17-09626 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2018 Jan 17;13(1):e0191358. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0191358. eCollection 2018.,20180226,1,"['0 (Receptors, Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.30 (Receptor, Transforming Growth Factor-beta Type II)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Colonic Neoplasms/metabolism', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/physiology', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/methods', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*metabolism/*physiology', 'Liver Neoplasms/pathology', 'Mice', 'Models, Biological', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism', 'Receptor, Transforming Growth Factor-beta Type II', 'Receptors, Transforming Growth Factor beta/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-9978-4719'],,,,,,['PLoS One. 2018 May 2;13(5):e0197008.

Yet, the mechanisms involved in NT5C2 mutation-driven clonal evolution during the initiation of leukaemia, disease progression and relapse remain unknown. Here we use a conditional-and-inducible leukaemia model to demonstrate that expression of NT5C2(R367Q), a highly prevalent relapsed-ALL NT5C2 mutation, induces resistance to chemotherapy with 6-mercaptopurine at the cost of impaired leukaemia cell growth and leukaemia-initiating cell activity. The loss-of-fitness phenotype of NT5C2(+/R367Q) mutant cells is associated with excess export of purines to the extracellular space and depletion of the intracellular purine-nucleotide pool. Consequently, blocking guanosine synthesis by inhibition of inosine-5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) induced increased cytotoxicity against NT5C2-mutant leukaemia lymphoblasts. These results identify the fitness cost of NT5C2 mutation and resistance to chemotherapy as key evolutionary drivers that shape clonal evolution in relapsed ALL and support a role for IMPDH inhibition in the treatment of ALL.","['Tzoneva, Gannie', 'Dieck, Chelsea L', 'Oshima, Koichi', 'Ambesi-Impiombato, Alberto', 'Sanchez-Martin, Marta', 'Madubata, Chioma J', 'Khiabanian, Hossein', 'Yu, Jiangyan',

Here we show that an evolutionarily conserved region located 1.7 megabases downstream of the Myc gene that has previously been labelled as a 'super-enhancer' is essential for the regulation of Myc expression levels in both normal haematopoietic and leukaemic stem cell hierarchies in mice and humans. Deletion of this region in mice leads to a complete loss of Myc expression in haematopoietic stem cells and progenitors. This caused an accumulation of differentiation-arrested multipotent progenitors and loss of myeloid and B cells, mimicking the phenotype caused by Mx1-Cre-mediated conditional deletion of the Myc gene in haematopoietic stem cells. This super-enhancer comprises multiple enhancer modules with selective activity that recruits a compendium of transcription factors, including GFI1b, RUNX1 and MYB. Analysis of mice carrying deletions of individual enhancer modules suggests that specific Myc expression levels throughout most of the haematopoietic hierarchy are controlled by the combinatorial and additive activity of individual enhancer modules, which collectively function as a 'blood enhancer cluster' (BENC). We show that BENC is also essential for the maintenance of MLL-AF9-driven leukaemia in mice. Furthermore, a BENC module, which controls Myc expression in mouse haematopoietic stem cells and progenitors, shows increased chromatin accessibility in human acute myeloid leukaemia stem cells compared to blasts. This difference correlates with MYC expression and patient outcome. We propose that clusters of enhancers, such as BENC, form highly combinatorial systems that allow precise control of gene expression across normal cellular hierarchies and which also can be hijacked in malignancies.","['Bahr, Carsten', 'von Paleske, Lisa', 'Uslu, Veli V', 'Remeseiro, Silvia', 'Takayama, Naoya', 'Ng, Stanley W', 'Murison, Alex', 'Langenfeld, Katja', 'Petretich, Massimo',

Improving the care of these patients will require a better understanding of their unmet needs, including symptom burden at the end of life, and patterns of healthcare utilization. OBJECTIVE: To describe AML patients' experiences in the last six months of life regarding symptom burden, blood product utilization, and use of palliative care services. METHODS: Exploratory analysis of prospectively collected patient-reported outcomes and healthcare utilization data during the last six months of life among 33 AML patients who died during a longitudinal observational study. RESULTS: Symptom burden, quality of life (QOL), and psychological distress worsened with proximity to death. Of the 26 patients with utilization data, most (n = 24; 92.4%) were hospitalized in the last month of life, with 26.9% (n = 7) dying in the intensive care unit. Patients required a median of 16 red blood cell transfusions in the last six months of life, and those with a high transfusion burden in the last month of life had a higher rate of in-hospital death (blood transfusions: p < 0.01; platelet transfusions: p = 0.03). Only six patients enrolled in hospice (23.1%). DISCUSSION: Patients with AML have marked symptoms and QOL impairments that escalate in the final six months of life. Patients entering the healthcare system for active cancer treatment are likely to continue disease-oriented care until death. High rates of hospitalization and blood product transfusion are a direct barrier to transitioning to hospice care.","['Lowe, Jared R', 'Yu, Yinxi', 'Wolf, Steven', 'Samsa, Greg', 'LeBlanc, Thomas W']","['Lowe JR', 'Yu Y', 'Wolf S', 'Samsa G', 'LeBlanc TW']","['1 Department of Medicine, Duke University School of Medicine , Durham, North Carolina.', '2 Department of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics, Duke University School of Medicine , Durham, North Carolina.', '2 Department of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics, Duke University School of Medicine , Durham, North Carolina.', '2 Department of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics, Duke University School of Medicine , Durham, North Carolina.', '3 Division of Hematologic Malignancies and Cellular Therapy, Department of Medicine, Duke University School of Medicine , Durham, North Carolina.']",['eng'],['UL1 TR001117/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Observational Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180117,United States,J Palliat Med,Journal of palliative medicine,9808462,PMC5963667,['NOTNLM'],"['*acute myeloid leukemia', '*blood transfusion', '*palliative care', '*patient-reported outcomes', '*quality of life', '*symptom burden']",2018/01/18 06:00,2020/03/03 06:00,['2018/01/18 06:00'],"['2018/01/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/03 06:00 [medline]', '2018/01/18 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/jpm.2017.0463 [doi]'],ppublish,J Palliat Med. 2018 May;21(5):592-597. doi: 10.1089/jpm.2017.0463.

The most of cases describe chronic lymphocytic leukemia as the leading lymphoproliferative disease with the tendency towards secondary malignancies development. Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) has been described in only 2 cases to co-occur with prostate adenocarcinoma (PAC). There are scarce data about the connection between MCL and urology cancers. We presented the first case of synchronous occurrence of MCL and PAC in the same patient in Serbia. Case report: A 64-year-old male initially presented with fatigue, splenomegaly, and bicytopenia. The bone marrow biopsy specimen revealed extensive infiltration with MCL. During lymphoma staging procedure prostate enlargement (57 mm) was accidentally found by multislice- computed tomography (MSCT). The serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) was elevated (52 ng/mL; normal values </= 4 ng/mL). Transrectal ultrasound biopsy revealed PAC. High Gleason score determined high-risk locally advanced PAC. The patient underwent treatment with chemotherapy and hormone therapy due to the existence of double malignancies. Cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone (CHOP) was applied for MCL, and luteinizing hormonereleasing hormone (LHRH) agonist, triptorelin, for PAC. Partial response was obtained for MCL, and stable disease for PAC. In a 1.5-year observation period the patient was still disease progression free for both of malignancies. Conclusion: This case points aut that elderly males are in need for careful observation during the staging procedure for lymphoma. The literature data suggest that MCL patients are in increased risk for urologic malignancies development. However, the etiologic connection between these two entities, except male gender and older age, remains unclear.","['Petkovic, Ivan', 'Stojnev, Slavica', 'Krstic, Miljan', 'Pejcic, Ivica', 'Vrbic, Svetislav']","['Petkovic I', 'Stojnev S', 'Krstic M', 'Pejcic I', 'Vrbic S']",,['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,Serbia,Vojnosanit Pregl,Vojnosanitetski pregled,21530700R,,,,2016/11/01 00:00,2018/02/14 06:00,['2018/01/18 06:00'],"['2016/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/14 06:00 [medline]', '2018/01/18 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.2298/VSP150425128P [doi]'],ppublish,Vojnosanit Pregl. 2016 Nov;73(11):1072-5. doi: 10.2298/VSP150425128P.,20180213,11,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/chemistry/diagnostic imaging/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', 'Biopsy', 'Bone Marrow Examination', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/chemistry/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multidetector Computed Tomography', 'Neoplasm Grading', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Neoplasms, Multiple Primary/chemistry/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/chemistry/diagnostic imaging/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Complex molecular profiles are frequently associated with the presence of an associated hematologic neoplasm (AHN) and an unfavorable clinical outcome. However, little is known about the incidence and prognostic impact of cytogenetic aberrations. We analyzed cytogenetic and molecular characteristics of 109 patients (KIT D816V+, n = 102, 94%) with indolent (ISM, n = 26) and advanced SM (n = 83) with (n = 73, 88%) or without AHN. An aberrant karyotype was identified in SM-AHN (16/73, 22%) patients only. In patients with an aberrant karyotype, additional somatic mutations were identified in 12/16 (75%) patients. Seven of 10 (70%) patients with a poor-risk karyotype, for example, monosomy 7 or complex karyotype, and 1/6 (17%) patients with a good-risk karyotype progressed to secondary acute myeloid leukemia (n = 7) or mast cell leukemia (n = 1) within a median of 40 months (range 2-190, P = .04). In advanced SM, the median overall survival (OS) of poor-risk karyotype patients was significantly shorter than in good-risk/normal karyotype patients (4 vs 39 months; hazard ratio 11.7, 95% CI 5.0-27.3; P < .0001). Additionally, the shortened OS in patients with poor-risk karyotype was independent from the mutation status. In summary, a poor-risk karyotype is an independent prognostic variable in advanced SM. Cytogenetic and molecular analyses should be routinely performed in all patients with advanced SM +/- AHN because these investigations greatly support prognostication and treatment decisions.","['Naumann, Nicole', 'Jawhar, Mohamad', 'Schwaab, Juliana', 'Kluger, Sebastian', 'Lubke, Johannes', 'Metzgeroth, Georgia', 'Popp, Henning D', 'Khaled, Nada', 'Horny, Hans-Peter', 'Sotlar, Karl', 'Valent, Peter', 'Haferlach, Claudia', 'Gohring, Gudrun', 'Schlegelberger, Brigitte', 'Meggendorfer, Manja', 'Hofmann, Wolf-Karsten', 'Cross, Nicholas C P', 'Reiter, Andreas', 'Fabarius, Alice']","['Naumann N', 'Jawhar M', 'Schwaab J', 'Kluger S', 'Lubke J', 'Metzgeroth G', 'Popp HD', 'Khaled N', 'Horny HP', 'Sotlar K', 'Valent P', 'Haferlach C', 'Gohring G', 'Schlegelberger B', 'Meggendorfer M', 'Hofmann WK', 'Cross NCP', 'Reiter A', 'Fabarius A']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Mannheim, Heidelberg University, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Mannheim, Heidelberg University, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Mannheim, Heidelberg University, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Mannheim, Heidelberg University, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Mannheim, Heidelberg University, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Mannheim, Heidelberg University, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Mannheim, Heidelberg University, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Mannheim, Heidelberg University, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology, Ludwig-Maximilians-University, Munich, Germany.', 'University Hospital Salzburg, Paracelsus Medical University, Salzburg, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology and Ludwig Boltzmann Cluster Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Human Genetics, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Human Genetics, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Mannheim, Heidelberg University, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom.', 'Wessex Regional Genetics Laboratory, Salisbury, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Mannheim, Heidelberg University, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Mannheim, Heidelberg University, Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180219,United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,,['NOTNLM'],"['*S/A/R panel', '*cytogenetic aberrations', '*molecular mutations', '*systemic mastocytosis']",2018/01/18 06:00,2018/09/08 06:00,['2018/01/18 06:00'],"['2017/11/06 00:00 [received]', '2018/01/14 00:00 [revised]', '2018/01/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/09/08 06:00 [medline]', '2018/01/18 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/gcc.22526 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2018 May;57(5):252-259. doi: 10.1002/gcc.22526.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: CML cell line K562 cells were treated with BHX. The effects of BHX on cell proliferation, apoptosis and cell cycle were detected. Subsequently, the caspase, ATP activity, Ca(2+) , ROS and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) levels treated with various concentrations of BHX were analysed. The variation of relevant proteins and genes was detected. Further, toxicity of BHX on peripheral blood cells, bone marrow-nucleated cells (BMNC) and organ index were investigated on mice. RESULTS: Results showed that BHX suppressed K562 cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner and induced apoptosis and G0/G1 phase arrest. BHX induced mitochondria-mediated apoptosis, which was associated with downregulation of MMP, activation of caspase-3 and caspase-9, generation of intracellular ROS and elevation of Ca(2+) in K562 cells. In treated cells, ATP levels were decreased, expression of total beta-catenin, phosphorylated beta-catenin and beta-catenin in the nucleus was decreased, and expression of cell cycle-related proteins was decreased. Further analysis revealed that BHX lowered the transcriptional level of beta-catenin. Lastly, BHX treatment significantly reduced the number of white blood cells, but had no effect on BMNC and organ index. CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide further insight into the potential use of BHX as an anti-cancer agent against human leukaemia.","['Bao, Hanmei', 'Zhang, Qing', 'Du, Yibo', 'Zhang, Cai', 'Xu, Hui', 'Zhu, Zhongling', 'Yan, Zhao']","['Bao H', 'Zhang Q', 'Du Y', 'Zhang C', 'Xu H', 'Zhu Z', 'Yan Z']","[""Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy, National Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Tianjin's Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, Tianjin, China."", ""Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy, National Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Tianjin's Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, Tianjin, China."", ""Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy, National Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Tianjin's Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, Tianjin, China."", ""Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy, National Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Tianjin's Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, Tianjin, China."", ""Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy, National Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Tianjin's Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, Tianjin, China."", ""Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy, National Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Tianjin's Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, Tianjin, China."", ""Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy, National Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Tianjin's Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, Tianjin, China.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20180116,England,Cell Prolif,Cell proliferation,9105195,PMC6528944,['NOTNLM'],"['apoptosis', 'chronic myeloid leukaemia', 'pyrazoline', 'beta-catenin']",2018/01/18 06:00,2018/06/27 06:00,['2018/01/18 06:00'],"['2017/09/19 00:00 [received]', '2017/12/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/06/27 06:00 [medline]', '2018/01/18 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/cpr.12433 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Prolif. 2018 Jun;51(3):e12433. doi: 10.1111/cpr.12433.

OBJECTIVE: To retrospectively investigate development of photosensitivity in patients with mycosis fungoides and other T-cell neoplasms after treatment with Mog. METHODS: We treated seven cutaneous lymphoma patients with Mog. Upon combination treatment with narrow-band UVB, we noticed that four patients developed photosensitivity dermatitis following Mog therapy, including two cases of mycosis fungoides, one case of adult T-cell leukaemia/lymphoma and one case of EB virus-associated T-cell lymphoproliferative disorder. Phototest was performed with UVA and UVB, and immunohistochemical staining for CD4, CD8 and Foxp3 was conducted in both photosensitivity and lymphoma lesions. RESULTS: Phototest revealed that the action spectrum of the photosensitivity was UVB in three cases and both UVB and UVA in one case. Histopathologically, the photosensitive lesions were characterized by a lichenoid tissue reaction with a CD8(+) T cell-dominant infiltrate, sharing the feature with chronic actinic dermatitis, an autoreactive photodermatosis with a cytotoxic T-cell response. Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells (Tregs) were decreased in the photosensitivity lesions compared with the lymphoma lesions. CONCLUSION: Increased incidence of photosensitivity reaction was observed during Mog treatment. Decreased number of Tregs in the lesional skin suggests that this reaction is possibly induced by autoreactive cytotoxic T cells.","['Masuda, Y', 'Tatsuno, K', 'Kitano, S', 'Miyazawa, H', 'Ishibe, J', 'Aoshima, M', 'Shimauchi, T', 'Fujiyama, T', 'Ito, T', 'Tokura, Y']","['Masuda Y', 'Tatsuno K', 'Kitano S', 'Miyazawa H', 'Ishibe J', 'Aoshima M', 'Shimauchi T', 'Fujiyama T', 'Ito T', 'Tokura Y']","['Department of Dermatology, Hamamatsu University School of Medicine, Hamamatsu, Japan.', 'Department of Dermatology, Hamamatsu University School of Medicine, Hamamatsu, Japan.', 'Department of Dermatology, Hamamatsu University School of Medicine, Hamamatsu, Japan.', 'Department of Dermatology, Hamamatsu University School of Medicine, Hamamatsu, Japan.', 'Department of Dermatology, Hamamatsu University School of Medicine, Hamamatsu, Japan.', 'Department of Dermatology, Hamamatsu University School of Medicine, Hamamatsu, Japan.', 'Department of Dermatology, Hamamatsu University School of Medicine, Hamamatsu, Japan.', 'Department of Dermatology, Hamamatsu University School of Medicine, Hamamatsu, Japan.', 'Department of Dermatology, Hamamatsu University School of Medicine, Hamamatsu, Japan.', 'Department of Dermatology, Hamamatsu University School of Medicine, Hamamatsu, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20180131,England,J Eur Acad Dermatol Venereol,Journal of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology : JEADV,9216037,,,,2018/01/18 06:00,2018/12/24 06:00,['2018/01/18 06:00'],"['2017/09/14 00:00 [received]', '2018/01/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/12/24 06:00 [medline]', '2018/01/18 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/jdv.14797 [doi]'],ppublish,J Eur Acad Dermatol Venereol. 2018 Sep;32(9):1456-1460. doi: 10.1111/jdv.14797.

Although the exact pathophysiology of this disease remains unknown, it is theorized to be the result of a delayed hypersensitivity response presenting as a cutaneous eruption days to weeks after exposure to the drug. The treatment involves discontinuation of the suspected medication, symptomatic control of pruritus, and topical steroid therapy. A 51-year-old woman with homocystinuria and fibromyalgia was admitted with fevers, pancytopenia (later diagnosed to be acute myelogenous leukemia), and a targetoid cutaneous eruption in the setting of a recent tick bite. She was subsequently noted to have symmetric, pruritic, erythematous papules over the lateral neck, retroauricular regions, lateral aspects of the inframammary regions, medial upper arms, axillae, and the lower abdomen two weeks after starting doxycycline. Considering the morphology, distribution, and intense pruritis associated with the eruption, a diagnosis of SDRIFE was made.

Its incidence rate is approximately 1.5 per 100,000 in infants younger than 1 year of age and 25 per 100,000 persons in octogenarians. Traditionally, cytogenetic markers are used to stratify patients in three risk categories: favorable, intermediate and unfavorable. However, the forecast stratification and the treatment decision for patients with normal karyotype shows difficulties due to the high clinical heterogeneity. The identification of several genetic mutations additional to classical molecular markers has been useful in identifying new entities. Nowadays, many different mutations and epigenetic aberrations have been implicated in the diagnostic, prognostic and treatment of AML.

In this context, an important role is played by the isothiocyanates. Recently, 6-(methylsulfonyl)hexyl isothiocyanate (6-MITC), present in the root of Wasabia Japonica, has stimulated the interest of researchers as a chemopreventive agent. In this particular study we have focused on evaluating 6-MITC's in vitro cytotoxic, cytostatic and cytodifferentiating activities, as well as its pro-apoptotic potential. These effects were investigated by way of flow cytometric analysis of Jurkat and HL-60 cells as well as of healthy lymphocytes extracted from the blood of AVIS donors, in order to verify a potential selectivity of action. The results demonstrate that 6-MITC exerts a stronger cytotoxic effect on tumour cells than on healthy cells. The apoptosis induction exerted by 6-MITC on transformed cells is triggered by an extrinsic pathway, as demonstrated by the statistically significant increase in the percentage of cells with activated caspase-8. It was also observed that 6-MITC is able to limit tumour growth by slowing down and blocking the cell cycle of Jurkat and HL-60 cells respectively, in a dose- and time-related manner, while exerting no activity of any kind on the replication of healthy cells. Finally, by measuring the expression levels of CD-14 and CD-15, 6-MITC showed the ability to induce cytodifferentiation of HL-60 cells into macrophage and granulocytic phenotypes.","['Lenzi, Monia', 'Cocchi, Veronica', 'Malaguti, Marco', 'Barbalace, Maria Cristina', 'Marchionni, Silvia', 'Hrelia, Silvana', 'Hrelia, Patrizia']","['Lenzi M', 'Cocchi V', 'Malaguti M', 'Barbalace MC', 'Marchionni S', 'Hrelia S', 'Hrelia P']","['Department of Pharmacy and Biotechnology, Alma Mater Studiorum-University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.', 'Department of Pharmacy and Biotechnology, Alma Mater Studiorum-University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.', 'Department for Life Quality Studies, Alma Mater Studiorum-University of Bologna, Rimini, Italy.', 'Department for Life Quality Studies, Alma Mater Studiorum-University of Bologna, Rimini, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedical and Neuromotor Sciences, Alma Mater Studiorum-University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.', 'Department for Life Quality Studies, Alma Mater Studiorum-University of Bologna, Rimini, Italy.', 'Department of Pharmacy and Biotechnology, Alma Mater Studiorum-University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20171204,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,PMC5762353,['NOTNLM'],"['6-(methylsulfonyl)hexyl isothiocyanate', 'HL-60 cells', 'Jurkat cells', 'apoptosis', 'cell cycle']",2018/01/18 06:00,2018/01/18 06:01,['2018/01/18 06:00'],"['2017/07/06 00:00 [received]', '2017/11/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/01/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/18 06:01 [medline]']","['10.18632/oncotarget.22902 [doi]', '22902 [pii]']",epublish,Oncotarget. 2017 Dec 4;8(67):111697-111714. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.22902. eCollection 2017 Dec 19.,,67,,,,,,"['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST The authors declare that they have no conflicts of', 'interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To study this cellular subset we created and validated an in vitro model employing the cell line TF-1a, treated with Transforming Growth Factor beta1 (TGFbeta1) and a mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor. The treated cells showed decreases in total RNA, Ki-67 and CD71, increased aldehyde dehydrogenase activity, forkhead box 03A (FOX03A) nuclear translocation and growth inhibition, with no evidence of apoptosis or differentiation. Using human genome gene expression profiling we identified a signature enriched for genes involved in adhesion, stemness/inhibition of differentiation and tumour suppression as well as canonical cell cycle regulation. The most upregulated gene was the osteopontin-coding gene SPP1. Dormant cells also demonstrated significantly upregulated beta 3 integrin (ITGB3) and CD44, as well as increased adhesion to their ligands vitronectin and hyaluronic acid as well as to bone marrow stromal cells. Immunocytochemistry of bone marrow biopsies of AML patients confirmed the positive expression of osteopontin in blasts near the para-trabecular bone marrow, whereas osteopontin was rarely detected in mononuclear cell isolates. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of the dormancy gene signature in primary acute myeloid leukaemia samples from the Cancer Genome Atlas identified a cluster enriched for dormancy genes associated with poor overall survival.","['Al-Asadi, Mazin Gh', 'Brindle, Grace', 'Castellanos, Marcos', 'May, Sean T', 'Mills, Ken I', 'Russell, Nigel H', 'Seedhouse, Claire H', 'Pallis, Monica']","['Al-Asadi MG', 'Brindle G', 'Castellanos M', 'May ST', 'Mills KI', 'Russell NH', 'Seedhouse CH', 'Pallis M']","['University of Nottingham, School of Medicine, Academic Haematology, Nottingham, UK.', 'University of Basrah, College of Medicine, Basrah, Iraq.', 'University of Nottingham, School of Medicine, Academic Haematology, Nottingham, UK.', 'University of Nottingham, School of Biosciences, Nottingham, UK.', 'University of Nottingham, School of Biosciences, Nottingham, UK.', ""Centre for Cancer Research and Cell Biology, Queen's University Belfast, Belfast, UK."", 'University of Nottingham, School of Medicine, Academic Haematology, Nottingham, UK.', 'Clinical Haematology, Nottingham University Hospitals, Nottingham, UK.', 'University of Nottingham, School of Medicine, Academic Haematology, Nottingham, UK.', 'Clinical Haematology, Nottingham University Hospitals, Nottingham, UK.']",['eng'],"['BB/E01772X/1/Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council/United', 'Kingdom', 'BBS/B/1356X/Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council/United Kingdom', 'BB/I001271/1/Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council/United', 'Kingdom', 'BB/E022758/1/Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council/United', 'Kingdom', 'G17764/Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council/United Kingdom', 'G18881/Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council/United Kingdom']",['Journal Article'],20171130,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,PMC5762331,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'dormancy', 'gene expression profiling']",2018/01/18 06:00,2018/01/18 06:01,['2018/01/18 06:00'],"['2017/09/19 00:00 [received]', '2017/11/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/01/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/18 06:01 [medline]']","['10.18632/oncotarget.22808 [doi]', '22808 [pii]']",epublish,Oncotarget. 2017 Nov 30;8(67):111405-111418. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.22808. eCollection 2017 Dec 19.,,67,,,,,,['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST The authors declare no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Numerous nutraceuticals and natural polyphenolic compounds have a wide range of abilities to alter cellular redox states with potential implications in various diseases. Furthermore, therapeutic options for cancers are mostly nonselective treatments including genotoxic or tubulin-targeting compounds. Some of the natural extracts, containing multiple bioactive compounds, could target multiple pathways in cancer cells to selectively induce cell death. Cymbopogon citratus (lemongrass) and Camellia sinensis (white tea) extracts have been shown to have medicinal properties, however, their activity against lymphoma and leukemia, as well as mechanistic details, have not been fully characterized. Herein, we report potent anti-cancer properties in dose and time-dependent manners of ethanolic lemongrass and hot water white tea extracts in lymphoma and leukemia models. Both extracts were able to effectively induce apoptosis selectively in these human cancer cell types. Interestingly, ethanolic lemongrass extract induces apoptosis primarily by the extrinsic pathway and was found to be dependent on the generation of ROS. Conversely, apoptotic induction by hot water white tea extract was independent of ROS. Furthermore, both of these extracts caused mitochondrial depolarization and decreased rates of oxygen consumption in lymphoma and leukemia cells, leading to cell death. Most importantly, both these extracts were effective in reducing tumor growth in human lymphoma xenograft models when administered orally. Thus, these natural extracts could have potential for being nontoxic alternatives for the treatment of cancer.","['Philion, Cory', 'Ma, Dennis', 'Ruvinov, Ivan', 'Mansour, Fadi', 'Pignanelli, Christopher', 'Noel, Megan', 'Saleem, Ammar', 'Arnason, John', 'Rodrigues, Mark', 'Singh, Inderpal', 'Ropat, Jesse', 'Pandey, Siyaram']","['Philion C', 'Ma D', 'Ruvinov I', 'Mansour F', 'Pignanelli C', 'Noel M', 'Saleem A', 'Arnason J', 'Rodrigues M', 'Singh I', 'Ropat J', 'Pandey S']","['Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Windsor, Windsor, Ontario N9B 3P4, Canada.', 'Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Windsor, Windsor, Ontario N9B 3P4, Canada.', 'Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Windsor, Windsor, Ontario N9B 3P4, Canada.', 'Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Windsor, Windsor, Ontario N9B 3P4, Canada.', 'Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Windsor, Windsor, Ontario N9B 3P4, Canada.', 'Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Windsor, Windsor, Ontario N9B 3P4, Canada.', 'Department of Biology, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario K1N 6N5, Canada.', 'Department of Biology, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario K1N 6N5, Canada.', 'Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Windsor, Windsor, Ontario N9B 3P4, Canada.', 'Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Windsor, Windsor, Ontario N9B 3P4, Canada.', 'Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Windsor, Windsor, Ontario N9B 3P4, Canada.', 'Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Windsor, Windsor, Ontario N9B 3P4, Canada.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20171118,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,PMC5762282,['NOTNLM'],"['cancer', 'leukemia', 'lymphoma', 'nutraceuticals', 'oxidative stress']",2018/01/18 06:00,2018/01/18 06:01,['2018/01/18 06:00'],"['2017/09/08 00:00 [received]', '2017/10/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/01/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/18 06:01 [medline]']","['10.18632/oncotarget.22502 [doi]', '22502 [pii]']",epublish,Oncotarget. 2017 Nov 18;8(67):110756-110773. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.22502. eCollection 2017 Dec 19.,,67,,,,,,['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST The authors declare no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Distinct from other pro-survival Bcl-2 family members, the short half-life of MCL-1 protein led us to investigate MCL-1 protein expression in a breast cancer tissue microarray and correlate this with clinical data. Here, we report associations between high MCL-1 and poor prognosis in specific subtypes of breast cancer including triple-negative breast cancer, an aggressive form that lacks targeted treatment options. Deletion of MCL-1 in the mammary epithelium of genetically engineered mice revealed an absolute requirement for MCL-1 in breast tumorigenesis. The clinical applicability of these findings was tested through a combination of approaches including knock-down or inhibition of MCL-1 to show triple-negative breast cancer cell line dependence on MCL-1 in vitro and in vivo.

The mechanisms of cardiac arrhythmia due to ATO exposure still need to be elucidated. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are emerging as major regulators of various pathophysiological processes. This study aimed to explore the involvement of lncRNAs in ATO-induced LQTS in vivo and in vitro. METHODS: For in vivo experiments, mice were administered ATO through the tail vein. For in vitro experiments, ATO was added to the culture medium of primary cultured neonatal mouse cardiomyocytes. To evaluate the effect of lncRNA Kcnq1ot1, siRNA and lentivirus-shRNA were synthesized to knockdown lncRNA Kcnq1ot1. RESULTS: After ATO treatment, the Kcnq1ot1 and Kcnq1 expression levels were down regulated. lncRNA Kcnq1ot1 knockdown prolonged the action potential duration (APD) in vitro and exerted LQTS in vivo. Correspondingly, Kcnq1 expression was decreased after silencing lncRNA Kcnq1ot1. However, the knockdown of Kcnq1 exerted no effect on lncRNA Kcnq1ot1 expression. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this report is the first to demonstrate that lncRNA Kcnq1ot1 downregulation is responsible for QT interval prolongation induced by ATO at least partially by repressing

Despite considerable efforts to develop single-target FLT3 drugs, so far, the most promising clinical response has been achieved using the multikinase inhibitor midostaurin. Here, we explore the activity of the indolocarbazole EC-70124, from the same chemical space as midostaurin, in preclinical models of AML, focusing on those bearing FLT3-ITD mutations. EC-70124 potently inhibits wild-type and mutant FLT3, and also other important kinases such as PIM kinases. EC-70124 inhibits proliferation of AML cell lines, inducing cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis. EC-70124 is orally bioavailable and displays higher metabolic stability and lower human protein plasma binding compared with midostaurin. Both in vitro and in vivo pharmacodynamic analyses demonstrate inhibition of FLT3-STAT5, Akt-mTOR-S6, and PIM-BAD pathways. Oral administration of EC-70124 in FLT3-ITD xenograft models demonstrates high efficacy, reaching complete tumor regression. Ex vivo, EC-70124 impaired cell viability in leukemic blasts, especially from FLT3-ITD patients. Our results demonstrate the ability of EC-70124 to reduce proliferation and induce cell death in AML cell lines, patient-derived leukemic blast and xenograft animal models, reaching best results in FLT3 mutants that carry other molecular pathways' alterations. Thus, its unique inhibition profile warrants EC-70124 as a promising agent for AML treatment based on its ability to interfere the complex oncogenic events activated in AML at several levels.

Discovering potent and selective Mcl-1 inhibitors that can relieve apoptotic blockades is thus a high priority for cancer research. An attractive strategy for disabling Mcl-1 involves using designer peptides to competitively engage its binding groove, mimicking the structural mechanism of action of native sensitizer BH3-only proteins. We transformed Mcl-1-binding peptides into alpha-helical, cell-penetrating constructs that are selectively cytotoxic to Mcl-1-dependent cancer cells. Critical to the design of effective inhibitors was our introduction of an all-hydrocarbon cross-link or ""staple"" that stabilizes alpha-helical structure, increases target binding affinity, and independently confers binding specificity for Mcl-1 over related Bcl-2 family paralogs. Two crystal structures of complexes at 1.4 A and 1.9 A resolution demonstrate how the hydrophobic staple induces an unanticipated structural rearrangement in Mcl-1 upon binding. Systematic sampling of staple location and iterative optimization of peptide sequence in accordance with established design principles provided peptides that target intracellular Mcl-1. This work provides proof of concept for the development of potent, selective, and cell-permeable stapled peptides for therapeutic targeting of Mcl-1 in cancer, applying a design and validation workflow applicable to a host of challenging biomedical targets.","['Rezaei Araghi, Raheleh', 'Bird, Gregory H', 'Ryan, Jeremy A', 'Jenson, Justin M', 'Godes, Marina', 'Pritz, Jonathan R', 'Grant, Robert A', 'Letai, Anthony', 'Walensky, Loren D', 'Keating, Amy E']","['Rezaei Araghi R', 'Bird GH', 'Ryan JA', 'Jenson JM', 'Godes M', 'Pritz JR', 'Grant RA', 'Letai A', 'Walensky LD', 'Keating AE']","['Department of Biology, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA 02139.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02215.', 'Linde Program in Cancer Chemical Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02215.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02215.', 'Department of Biology, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA 02139.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02215.', 'Linde Program in Cancer Chemical Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02215.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02215.', 'Linde Program in Cancer Chemical Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02215.', 'Department of Biology, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA 02139.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02215.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02215; Loren_Walensky@dfci.harvard.edu keating@mit.edu.', 'Linde Program in Cancer Chemical Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02215.', 'Department of Biology, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA 02139; Loren_Walensky@dfci.harvard.edu keating@mit.edu.', 'Department of Biological Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA 02139.']",['eng'],"['R01 GM110048/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA209358/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R35 CA197583/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R50 CA211399/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20180116,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,PMC5798337,['NOTNLM'],"['*BH3 mimetic', '*Mcl-1', '*apoptosis', '*inhibitor', '*stapled peptide']",2018/01/18 06:00,2018/07/26 06:00,['2018/01/18 06:00'],"['2018/01/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/07/26 06:00 [medline]', '2018/01/18 06:00 [entrez]']","['1712952115 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1712952115 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2018 Jan 30;115(5):E886-E895. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1712952115.

IDH1/2(MUT) enzymes produce D-2-hydroxyglutarate (D2HG), which associates with increased DNA damage and improved responses to chemo/radiotherapy and PARP inhibitors in solid tumor cells. Whether this also holds true for IDH1/2(MUT) AML is not known.Experimental Design: Well-characterized primary IDH1(MUT), IDH2(MUT), and IDH1/2(WT) AML cells were analyzed for DNA damage and responses to daunorubicin, ionizing radiation, and PARP inhibitors.Results:IDH1/2(MUT) caused increased DNA damage and sensitization to daunorubicin, irradiation, and the PARP inhibitors olaparib and talazoparib in AML cells. IDH1/2(MUT) inhibitors protected against these treatments. Combined treatment with a PARP inhibitor and daunorubicin had an additive effect on the killing of IDH1/2(MUT) AML cells. We provide evidence that the therapy sensitivity of IDH1/2(MUT) cells was caused by D2HG-mediated downregulation of expression of the DNA damage response gene ATM and not by altered redox responses due to metabolic alterations in IDH1/2(MUT) cells.Conclusions:IDH1/2(MUT) AML cells are sensitive to PARP inhibitors as monotherapy but especially when combined with a DNA-damaging agent, such as daunorubicin, whereas concomitant administration of IDH1/2(MUT) inhibitors during cytotoxic therapy decrease the efficacy of both agents in IDH1/2(MUT) AML. These results advocate in favor of clinical trials of PARP inhibitors either or not in combination with daunorubicin in IDH1/2(MUT) AML. Clin Cancer Res; 24(7); 1705-15.

LINC00152 inhibited the expression of miR-193a-3p, which negatively regulated MCL1 In addition, GC cells proliferation was inhibited by cell transfection with shRNA-MCL1, and enhanced by transfection with miR-193a-3p mimics. Our study suggested that LINC00152 was overexpressed in GC tissues, and it down-regulated miR-193a-3p to enhance MCL1 expression thereby promoting GC cells proliferation.","['Huang, Yong', 'Luo, Hui', 'Li, Fang', ""Yang, Yun'e"", 'Ou, Guangsheng', 'Ye, Xiaolong', 'Li, Nianchu']","['Huang Y', 'Luo H', 'Li F', 'Yang Y', 'Ou G', 'Ye X', 'Li N']","['Department of Gastrointestinal Surgery, Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou 510630, Guangdong, China.', 'Anesthesia Surgery Center, Lingnan Hospital, Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou 51000, Guangdong, China.', 'Supply Room, Lingnan Hospital, Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou 51000, Guangdong, China.', 'Department of Gastrointestinal Surgery, Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou 510630, Guangdong, China.', 'Department of Gastrointestinal Surgery, Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou 510630, Guangdong, China.', 'Department of Gastrointestinal Surgery, Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou 510630, Guangdong, China.', ""Department of Hepatobiliary Surgery, Nanning Second People's Hospital, Nanning 530031, Guangxi, China giaojy1979@126.com.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180508,England,Biosci Rep,Bioscience reports,8102797,PMC5938421,['NOTNLM'],"['*LINC00152', '*MCL1', '*gastric cancer', '*miR-193a-3p']",2018/01/18 06:00,2019/03/16 06:00,['2018/01/18 06:00'],"['2017/10/30 00:00 [received]', '2017/12/09 00:00 [revised]', '2018/01/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/16 06:00 [medline]', '2018/01/18 06:00 [entrez]']","['BSR20171607 [pii]', '10.1042/BSR20171607 [doi]']",epublish,Biosci Rep. 2018 May 8;38(3). pii: BSR20171607. doi: 10.1042/BSR20171607.

These resident germ cells termed gonocytes are the predecessors of spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) and differentiating spermatogonia. Both of which are essential for male fertility where the former maintains the continuity of spermatogenesis and the latter generates pioneering waves of spermatozoa. Therefore the timely initiation of gonocytes-to-spermatogonia transition (GST) is an important process during which the cell fates of gonocytes might be segregated. However, it is unknown whether gonocytes are composed of a heterogeneous mixture of germ cells with distinct differentiation potentials during GST. Here, we find that gonocytes exhibit heterogeneity in terms of the expression pattern of at least three early spermatogonial marker genes namely Nanos2, Stra8 and Gfra1. NANOS2 expression levels are negatively correlated with those of STRA8 and GFRA1 before GST, while positive correlation with GFRA1 is established after GST. We further find that overexpression of NANOS2 results in the repression of GFRA1 and PLZF in gonocytes, leading to a delay in GST. On the other hand, loss of NANOS2 results in the up-regulation of GFRA1 and PLZF, indicating a precocious entry of GST. Taken together, our data suggest that NANOS2 functions as an intrinsic timekeeper of GST in the mouse testes.","['Pui, Han Pin', 'Saga, Yumiko']","['Pui HP', 'Saga Y']","['Department of Genetics, The Graduate University for Advanced Studies, 1111 Yata, Mishima, 411-8540 Shizuoka, Japan; Division of Mammalian Development, National Institute of Genetics, 1111 Yata, Mishima, 411-8540 Shizuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Genetics, The Graduate University for Advanced Studies, 1111 Yata, Mishima, 411-8540 Shizuoka, Japan; Division of Mammalian Development, National Institute of Genetics, 1111 Yata, Mishima, 411-8540 Shizuoka, Japan; Department of Biological Sciences, Graduate School of Science, The University of Tokyo, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, 113-0033 Tokyo, Japan.

Treatment with hypomethylating agents such as azacitidine and decitabine is common, but responses are modest and typically short-lived. The oral anti-apoptotic B-cell lymphoma 2 protein inhibitor, venetoclax, has shown promising single-agent activity in patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukaemia and preclinical data suggested synergy between hypomethylating agents and venetoclax, which led to this combination phase 1b study. METHODS: Previously untreated patients aged 65 years and over with acute myeloid leukaemia who were ineligible for standard induction therapy were enrolled into this non-randomised, open-label, phase 1b study. Patients were required to have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-2 and either intermediate-risk or poor-risk cytogenetics. Patients were enrolled into one of three groups for the dose-escalation phase of this study: group A (venetoclax and intravenous decitabine 20 mg/m(2) [days 1-5 of each 28-day cycle]), group B (venetoclax and subcutaneous or intravenous azacitidine 75 mg/m(2) [days 1-7 of each 28-day cycle]), and group C (a venetoclax and decitabine substudy with the oral CYP3A inhibitor posaconazole, 300 mg twice on cycle 1, day 21, and 300 mg once daily from cycle 1, days 22-28, to assess its effect on venetoclax pharmacokinetics). Dose escalation followed a standard 3 + 3 design with at least three evaluable patients enrolled per cohort; daily target doses of venetoclax for groups A and B were 400 mg (cohort 1), 800 mg (cohorts 2 and 3), and 1200 mg (cohort 4), and 400 mg for group C. The primary endpoints were the safety and pharmacokinetics of venetoclax plus decitabine or azacitidine, and to determine the maximum tolerated dose and recommended phase 2 dose. Secondary endpoints included the preliminary anti-leukaemic activity of venetoclax with decitabine or azacitidine through the analysis of overall response, duration of response, and overall survival. We analysed safety, pharmacokinetics, and anti-leukaemic activity in all patients who received one or more venetoclax doses. The expansion phase of the study is ongoing but is closed to accrual. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02203773. FINDINGS: 57 patients were enrolled in the study. 23 patients in group A and 22 patients in group B were enrolled between Nov 19, 2014, and Dec 15, 2015, and 12 patients in group C were enrolled between June 14, 2015, and Jan 16, 2016. As of data cutoff on June 15, 2016, the most common grade 3-4 treatment-emergent adverse events were thrombocytopenia (27 [47%] of 57 patients; nine in group A, 13 in group B, and five in group C), febrile neutropenia (24 [42%] of 57; 11 in group A, ten in group B, and three in group C), and neutropenia (23 [40%] of 57; 12 in group A, eight in group B, and three in group C). The most common serious treatment-emergent adverse event in groups A and B was febrile neutropenia (seven [30%] of 23 patients vs seven [32%] of 22), whereas in group C it was lung infection (four [33%] of 12 patients). 49 (86%) of 57 patients had treatment-related adverse events; the most common in groups A and B included nausea (12 [52%] patients vs seven [32%] patients), fatigue (six [26%] patients vs seven [32%]), and decreased neutrophil count (six [26%] patients vs six [27%]), whereas in group C the most common were nausea (seven [58%] of 12 patients), leucopenia (six [50%]), vomiting (five [42%]), and decreased platelet count (five [42%]). The maximum tolerated dose was not reached. The recommended phase 2 dose was 400 mg once a day or 800 mg with an interrupted dosing schedule (safety expansion). In total, four (7%) of 57 patients had died within 30 days of the first venetoclax dose caused by sepsis (group B), bacteraemia (group A), lung infection (group C), and respiratory failure (group A). Tumour lysis syndrome was not observed. Decitabine and azacitidine did not substantially affect venetoclax exposures. Overall, 35 (61%; 95% CI 47.6-74.0) of 57 patients achieved complete remission or complete remission with incomplete marrow recovery. In groups A and B, 27 (60%; 95% CI 44.3-74.3) of 45 patients had complete remission or complete remission with incomplete marrow recovery. INTERPRETATION: Venetoclax plus hypomethylating agent therapy seems to be a novel, well-tolerated regimen with promising activity in this underserved patient population. Evaluation of expansion cohorts is ongoing at 400 mg and 800 mg doses using both hypomethylating agent combinations.

A total of 540 young grass carp (231.85+/-0.63g) were fed six diets containing graded levels of PN (0.12-7.48mg/kg diet) for 10 weeks. At the end of the feeding trial, the fish were challenged with Aeromonas hydrophila for 2 weeks. The results showed that compared with the optimal PN level, PN deficiency (1) increased the contents of reactive oxygen species (ROS), malondialdehyde (MDA) and protein carbonyl (PC), decreased the activities and mRNA levels of antioxidant enzymes such as copper, zinc superoxide dismutase (CuZnSOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and glutathione reductase (GR) (P<.05); (2) up-regulated the mRNA levels of cysteinyl aspartic acid-protease-3 (caspase-3), caspase-7, caspase-8, caspase-9, Bcl-2 associated X protein (Bax), apoptotic protease activating factor-1 (Apaf-1) and Fas ligand (FasL), and down-regulated the mRNA levels of inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAP), B-cell lymphoma protein-2 (Bcl-2) and myeloid cell leukaemia-1 (Mcl-1) (P<.05); (3) down-regulated the mRNA levels of ZO-1, occludin [only in middle intestine (MI)], claudin-b, claudin-c, claudin-f, claudin-3c, claudin-7a, claudin-7b and claudin-11, and up-regulated the mRNA levels of claudin-12 and claudin-15a (P<.05), which might be partly linked to Kelch-like-ECH-associated protein 1a (Keap1a)/NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38MAPK) and myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) signalling in the intestines of fish. However, the activities and mRNA levels of MnSOD, the mRNA levels of Keap1b, c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK) and claudin-15b in three intestinal segments, and the mRNA levels of occludin in the proximal intestine (PI) and distal intestine (DI) were not affected by graded levels of PN. These data indicate that PN deficiency could disturb the intestinal physical barrier function of fish.

Methods The clinical data of CLL patients receiving fludarabine,cyclophosphamide+/-rituximab (with or without rituximab) regimen or cyclophosphamide,vincristine,and prednisone+/-doxorubicin+/-rituximab regimen in our hospital from March 2000 to February 2015 were analyzed retrospectively. Therapeutic efficacies and survivals of patients treated with different regimens were evaluated and compared. Results The complete response (CR) rate and the overall response rate (ORR) in 72 patients (43.6%) treated with rituximab were significantly higher than those treated without rituximab (38.9% vs. 21.5%,P=0.015;83.3% vs. 60.2%,P=0.001). The median PFS and OS for patients treated with rituximab were 53.0 (27.0-79.0) months and 112.0 (81.1-142.9) months,and the median PFS and OS for patients treated without rituximab were 28.0 (18.3-37.7) months and 89.0(72.0-106.0),but the results were not statistically significant (P=0.094,P=0.109). According to the cytogenetic features,patients were further divided into high-risk subgroup (with chromosome 17p deletion or 11q deletion) and non-high-risk subgroup. And in the high-risk subgroup,the ORR of patients treated with rituximab was 86.4%,which was significantly higher than that in patients treated without rituximab (53.3%)(P=0.012);in the non-high-risk subgroup,the PFS was marginally prolonged in patients treated with rituximab,but the difference was not statistically significant(P=0.050). Conclusions Compared with traditional chemotherapy,the chemoimmunotherapies with rituximab result in higher CR rate and ORR in CLL patients. In patients without 17p deletion or 11q deletion,the use of rituximab can marginally prolong PFS.","['Li, Heng', 'Xiong, Wen Jie', 'Liu, Hui Min', 'Yi, Shu Hua', 'Lu, Rui', 'Wang, Ting Yu', 'Yu, Zhen', 'Qiu, Lu Gui', 'Li, Zeng Jun']","['Li H', 'Xiong WJ', 'Liu HM', 'Yi SH', 'Lu R', 'Wang TY', 'Yu Z', 'Qiu LG', 'Li ZJ']","['State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology,Institute of Hematology and Blood Disease Hospital,CAMS and PUMC,Tianjin 300020,China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology,Institute of Hematology and Blood Disease Hospital,CAMS and PUMC,Tianjin 300020,China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology,Institute of Hematology and Blood Disease Hospital,CAMS and PUMC,Tianjin 300020,China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology,Institute of Hematology and Blood Disease Hospital,CAMS and PUMC,Tianjin 300020,China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology,Institute of Hematology and Blood Disease Hospital,CAMS and PUMC,Tianjin 300020,China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology,Institute of Hematology and Blood Disease Hospital,CAMS and PUMC,Tianjin 300020,China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology,Institute of Hematology and Blood Disease Hospital,CAMS and PUMC,Tianjin 300020,China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology,Institute of Hematology and Blood Disease Hospital,CAMS and PUMC,Tianjin 300020,China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology,Institute of Hematology and Blood Disease Hospital,CAMS and PUMC,Tianjin 300020,China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,China,Zhongguo Yi Xue Ke Xue Yuan Xue Bao,Zhongguo yi xue ke xue yuan xue bao.

Thus, we aim to thoroughly investigate the expression and role of GM-CSFR and G-CSFR on ph + ALL patients. METHOD: SUP-B15, BALL-1 and primary leukemia cells were used in this study. Transcript levels were analyzed by quantitative PCR while cell viability was measured using a CCK-8 assay. Flow cytometry was used to assess the different stages of cell cycle. RESULTS: We found that the mRNA expression levels of GM-CSFR and G-CSFR were higher in patients with ph + ALL, as well as in SUP-B15 cells. rhG-CSF was also observed to promote the viability of SUP-B15 cells while inversely inhibiting BALL-1 cell viability. In addition, we also determined that rhG-CSF (100 ng/ml) decreased the sensitivity of SUP-B15 cells to imatinib and nilotinib, while the results were exactly the contrary for dasatinib. CONCLUSION: We demonstrated high expression levels of GM-CSFR and G-CSFR, as well as their promotable role for viability in ph + ALL cells. We further found that rhG-CSF influenced the sensitivity of SUP-B15 cells to TKIs.","['Wu, Yong', 'Tan, Ming', 'Chen, Mei-Ling', 'Chen, Yuan-Zhong']","['Wu Y', 'Tan M', 'Chen ML', 'Chen YZ']","['a Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory of Hematology , Fujian Institute of Hematology, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital , Fujian , P.R.

Areas covered: The low number of patients, the heterogeneous genomic landscape of AML, novel diagnostic techniques, divergent available treatment protocols, and dose-limiting toxicity of conventional agents all contribute to the complexity of AML treatment. This review gives an overview of the current clinical challenges with respect to diagnostics, treatment, and supportive care in pAML. Expert commentary: Due to intensified treatment regimens and improved supportive care measures, the outcome for pAML patients has improved substantially over the past years. However, most treatment protocols still rely on conventional chemotherapeutic agents with significant toxicity. Although targeted therapies promise to reduce the need for high doses of conventional agents with a subsequent decrease in toxicity, the effectiveness of these strategies remains unsatisfactory today. International collaborations are needed in order to address the ongoing therapeutic challenges of reducing toxicity while increasing effectivity. Consensus on risk-group classification, a common chemotherapy backbone and evidence-based supportive care guidelines are necessary in this context, at the same time enabling intergroup studies on new agents in subgroups.","['Klein, Kim', 'de Haas, Valerie', 'Kaspers, Gertjan J L']","['Klein K', 'de Haas V', 'Kaspers GJL']","['a Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology , VU University Medical Center , Amsterdam , The Netherlands.', 'b Dutch Childhood Oncology Group , The Hague , The Netherlands.', 'c Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology , Utrecht , The Netherlands.', 'a Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology , VU University Medical Center , Amsterdam , The Netherlands.', 'b Dutch Childhood Oncology Group , The Hague , The Netherlands.', 'c Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology , Utrecht , The Netherlands.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20180120,England,Expert Rev Anticancer Ther,Expert review of anticancer therapy,101123358,,['NOTNLM'],"['*(Pediatric) acute myeloid leukemia', '*childhood leukemia', '*clinical decision making', '*cytogenetics']",2018/01/18 06:00,2018/12/12 06:00,['2018/01/18 06:00'],"['2018/01/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/12/12 06:00 [medline]', '2018/01/18 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/14737140.2018.1428091 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Rev Anticancer Ther. 2018 Mar;18(3):277-293. doi: 10.1080/14737140.2018.1428091.

However, as a phenomenon in the contemporary treatment and care of people with cancer, financial toxicity is not fully understood, with the discussion on mitigation mainly geared toward interventions at the health system level. Although important, health policy prescriptions take time before their intended results manifest, if they are implemented at all. They require corresponding strategies at the individual patient level. In this review, the authors discuss the nature of financial toxicity, defined as the objective financial burden and subjective financial distress of patients with cancer, as a result of treatments using innovative drugs and concomitant health services. They discuss coping with financial toxicity by patients and how maladaptive coping leads to poor health and nonhealth outcomes. They cover management strategies for oncologists, including having the difficult and urgent conversation about the cost and value of cancer treatment, availability of and access to resources, and assessment of financial toxicity as part of supportive care in the provision of comprehensive cancer care.

RECENT FINDINGS: We describe the origin of induction chemotherapy. We also describe notable modifications and adjustments to 7+3 induction chemotherapy since its development. Finally, we describe new efforts to modify and add new agents to induction therapy, including '7+3 Plus' combinations. SUMMARY: Induction chemotherapy remains the standard of care for the majority of patients with acute myeloid leukaemia. However, its success is limited in a subset of patients by toxicity, failure to achieve remission and potential for subsequent relapse. Novel agents such as mutant fms like tyrosine kinase 3 inhibitors, mutant isocitrate dehydrogenase inhibitors, CD33-antibody drug conjugates and liposomal formulations have demonstrated significant potential as modifications to traditional induction chemotherapy.","['Upadhyay, Vivek A', 'Fathi, Amir T']","['Upadhyay VA', 'Fathi AT']","['Department of Medicine.', 'Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Massachusetts General Hospital.', 'Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,,,,2018/01/18 06:00,2019/01/12 06:00,['2018/01/17 06:00'],"['2018/01/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/12 06:00 [medline]', '2018/01/17 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/MOH.0000000000000407 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2018 Mar;25(2):67-74. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0000000000000407.,20190111,2,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Induction Chemotherapy/*methods', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We aimed to focus on frailty in patients with AML, in all ages and aimed to evaluate its role and practicality in daily routine. Data of patients diagnosed and treated for AML between 2006 and 2016 are recorded and assessed for their survival predictivity. One hundred and ninety-seven patients were <65 years of age and 175 were >/=65. Majority of the younger patients showed ECOG 2 performance (119, 60.4%). Combined with ECOG scale, G8 scale showed survival predictivity in younger patients as well as older patients. Nutritional status showed a strong predictivity in younger patients while remained insignificant in older patients. VES13 scale showed similar predictivity strength for survival in both age groups (p = .001). Young AML patients should be thoroughly evaluated as older patients. ECOG performance evaluation should be supported with further scales. Young patients with lower ECOG scores may be regarded as vulnerable with scales embracing dimensions such as nutrition, perception of disease, depression and cognition. Nutrition should be within the main goals of intensive treatment and is related with survival.","['Umit, E G', 'Baysal, M', 'Demir, A M']","['Umit EG', 'Baysal M', 'Demir AM']","['Department of Hematology, Trakya University Faculty of Medicine, Edirne, Turkey.', 'Department of Hematology, Trakya University Faculty of Medicine, Edirne, Turkey.', 'Department of Hematology, Trakya University Faculty of Medicine, Edirne, Turkey.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20180116,England,Eur J Cancer Care (Engl),European journal of cancer care,9301979,,['NOTNLM'],"['ECOG', 'frailty', 'leukaemia', 'supportive care']",2018/01/18 06:00,2018/09/18 06:00,['2018/01/17 06:00'],"['2017/11/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/09/18 06:00 [medline]', '2018/01/17 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ecc.12810 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Cancer Care (Engl). 2018 Mar;27(2):e12810. doi: 10.1111/ecc.12810.

Sequential strategies have shown promising results in refractory acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), but have not been validated in a haploidentical (Haplo) transplant setting. We have developed a new sequential approach combining chemotherapy with broad antitumor activity (thiotepa 10 mg/kg, etoposide 400 mg/m(2), and cyclophosphamide 1600 mg/m(2) from day -15 to day -10), followed after 3 days of rest by a reduced-intensity conditioning regimen (fludarabine 150 mg/m(2), i.v. busulfan 6.4 mg/kg, and thymoglobulin 5 mg/kg from day -6 to day -2). High-dose post-transplantation cyclophosphamide was added in cases with Haplo donors. Seventy-two patients (median age, 54 years) with a refractory hematologic malignancy (44 with acute myelogenous leukemia, 7 with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, 15 with myelodysplastic syndrome/myeloproliferative neoplasms, and 6 with lymphomas) were included in this retrospective multicenter study. Donors were Haplo (n = 27), matched related (MRD; n = 16), and unrelated (UD; n = 29). With a median follow-up of 21 months, the 2-year overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) were 54.7% and 49.3%, respectively, in recipients of Haplo transplants, 49.2% and 43.8%, respectively, in recipients of MRD transplants, and 37.9% and 28%, respectively, in recipients of UD transplants. Compared with UD, the outcomes were improved in Haplo in terms of the incidences of acute grade II-IV graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) (11.1% versus 41.4%; P < .001) and GVHD-free, relapse-free survival (44.4 versus 10.3%; P = .022). These results support the safety and efficacy of a thiotepa-based sequential approach in allogeneic SCT with a Haplo donor with post-transplantation immune modulation. Thus, in patients with refractory hematologic malignancies, there seems to be no benefit in searching for a UD when a Haplo donor is readily available.","['Dulery, Remy', 'Menard, Anne-Lise', 'Chantepie, Sylvain', 'El-Cheikh, Jean', 'Francois, Sylvie', 'Delage, Jeremy', 'Giannotti, Federica', 'Ruggeri, Annalisa', 'Brissot, Eolia', 'Battipaglia, Giorgia', 'Malard, Florent', 'Belhocine, Ramdane', 'Sestili, Simona', 'Vekhoff, Anne', 'Delhommeau, Francois', 'Reman, Oumedaly', 'Legrand, Ollivier', 'Labopin, Myriam', 'Rubio, Marie-Therese', 'Mohty, Mohamad']","['Dulery R', 'Menard AL', 'Chantepie S', 'El-Cheikh J', 'Francois S', 'Delage J', 'Giannotti F', 'Ruggeri A', 'Brissot E', 'Battipaglia G', 'Malard F', 'Belhocine R', 'Sestili S', 'Vekhoff A', 'Delhommeau F', 'Reman O', 'Legrand O', 'Labopin M', 'Rubio MT', 'Mohty M']","['Department of Hematology and Cellular Therapy, Saint Antoine Hospital, AP-HP, Paris, France; UMRS 938, Inserm, Paris, France; Universite Pierre et Marie Curie Paris VI, Sorbonne University, Paris, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Henri Becquerel Center, Rouen, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Caen University Hospital, Caen, France.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Program, Department of Internal Medicine, American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Department of Hematology, Angers University Hospital, Angers, France.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital of Montpellier, Montpellier, France.', 'Department of Hematology and Cellular Therapy, Saint Antoine Hospital, AP-HP, Paris, France; Universite Pierre et Marie Curie Paris VI, Sorbonne University, Paris, France.', 'Department of Hematology and Cellular Therapy, Saint Antoine Hospital, AP-HP, Paris, France.', 'Department of Hematology and Cellular Therapy, Saint Antoine Hospital, AP-HP, Paris, France; UMRS 938, Inserm, Paris, France; Universite Pierre et Marie Curie Paris VI, Sorbonne University, Paris, France.', 'Department of Hematology and Cellular Therapy, Saint Antoine Hospital, AP-HP, Paris, France; Department of Hematology and Marrow Transplantation, Federico II University, Naples, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology and Cellular Therapy, Saint Antoine Hospital, AP-HP, Paris, France; UMRS 938, Inserm, Paris, France; Universite Pierre et Marie Curie Paris VI, Sorbonne University, Paris, France.', 'Department of Hematology and Cellular Therapy, Saint Antoine Hospital, AP-HP, Paris, France.', 'Department of Hematology and Cellular Therapy, Saint Antoine Hospital, AP-HP, Paris, France.', 'Department of Hematology and Cellular Therapy, Saint Antoine Hospital, AP-HP, Paris, France.', 'Department of Hematology and Cellular Therapy, Saint Antoine Hospital, AP-HP, Paris, France; UMRS 938, Inserm, Paris, France; Universite Pierre et Marie Curie Paris VI, Sorbonne University, Paris, France; Department of Biological Hematology, Saint Antoine and Armand-Trousseau Hospitals, AP-HP, Paris, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Caen University Hospital, Caen, France.', 'Department of Hematology and Cellular Therapy, Saint Antoine Hospital, AP-HP, Paris, France; UMRS 938, Inserm, Paris, France; Universite Pierre et Marie Curie Paris VI, Sorbonne University, Paris, France.', 'Department of Hematology and Cellular Therapy, Saint Antoine Hospital, AP-HP, Paris, France; UMRS 938, Inserm, Paris, France; Universite Pierre et Marie Curie Paris VI, Sorbonne University, Paris, France; Paris Study Office/CEREST-TC, European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Paris, France.', 'Department of Hematology and Cellular Therapy, Saint Antoine Hospital, AP-HP, Paris, France.', 'Department of Hematology and Cellular Therapy, Saint Antoine Hospital, AP-HP, Paris, France; UMRS 938, Inserm, Paris, France; Universite Pierre et Marie Curie Paris VI, Sorbonne University, Paris, France.

Fragments generated from pre- or mature tRNAs by specific endonucleases cleavage (tRNA-derived small non-coding RNA [tsncRNAs]), rather than random degradation products, are newly defined functional small non-coding RNAs (sncRNAs). They can be regulated in bacteria, yeast, plants and animals to respond to stress conditions, resulting in regulation of gene expressions at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional level. Increasing evidence showed that the dysregulation of a series of tsncRNAs is associated with several types of human disease.

Patients with HSTCL commonly present with B-symptoms and cytopenias, which may suggest a diagnosis of acute leukemia initially. Patients present with extranodal disease involving the spleen, liver and bone marrow; lymphadenopathy is usually absent. The lymphoma cells can show a spectrum of cell sizes and are of T-cell lineage, often negative for CD4 and CD8 and positive for T-cell receptor gammadelta or, less often, alphabeta. Recent studies have identified gene mutations in oncogenic pathways that are likely involved in pathogenesis and may be targets for therapy. Mutations in STAT3 or STAT5B lead to activation of the JAK/STAT pathway, and mutations involving SETD2, IN080 and ARID1 are involved in chromatin modification. Currently, there is no consensus standard of care for HSTCL patients, although several studies support a role for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant. Although patients with HSTCL are best treated in the context of clinical trials, the rarity of these neoplasms likely necessitates a multi-institutional approach. In this review, we focus on the clinicopathologic and genetic characteristics of HSTCL. We also discuss the differential diagnosis and therapeutic approaches.","['Yabe, Mariko', 'Miranda, Roberto N', 'Medeiros, L Jeffrey']","['Yabe M', 'Miranda RN', 'Medeiros LJ']","['Hematopathology Service, Department of Pathology, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA.

There is no biomarker to indicate future lymphoma risk in RA and it is not known whether factors associated with an increased risk of RA also confer an increased risk of lymphoma. We investigated whether anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) antibodies, other autoantibodies, and smoking, are associated with lymphoma development in RA. METHOD: From two population-based case-control studies, the Scandinavian Lymphoma Etiology (SCALE) study and the Epidemiological Investigation of Rheumatoid Arthritis (EIRA) I study, we identified lymphoma cases with a validated RA diagnosis (n = 50), to whom we matched study participants with RA but no lymphoma (n = 261), lymphoma but no RA (n = 257), and neither RA nor lymphoma (n = 233). Lymphomas were classified according to the WHO classification. Blood samples were analysed for immunoglobulin G (IgG), IgM, and IgA isotypes and IgG1-4 subclasses of anti-CCP antibodies and for 15 antinuclear antibody (ANA)-associated specific autoantibodies. Relative risks were estimated as crude and adjusted odds ratios (adjOR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using logistic regression.

CASE REPORT: A 14-year-old boy with trisomy-21 and a history of B-lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (B-ALL) diagnosed 1.5 years prior, on maintenance chemotherapy, presented with fever and respiratory symptoms. Chest X-ray revealed right-lower-lobe consolidation. He was treated for pneumonia but continued to be febrile with worsening respiratory status, with development of additional pulmonary and liver nodules. No infectious etiology was identified. Following nondiagnostic lung and liver biopsies, the largest pulmonary mass was resected. The histopathologic findings were diagnostic of lymphomatoid granulomatosis. There was no residual B-ALL. The patient's status continued to deteriorate and he died shortly thereafter. CONCLUSION: Relative immunosuppression due to maintenance therapy for B-ALL can lead to lymphomatoid granulomatosis.","['Matynia, Anna Paulina', 'Perkins, Sherrie L', 'Li, David']","['Matynia AP', 'Perkins SL', 'Li D']","['a Department of Pathology, University of Utah , Salt Lake City , Utah , United States.', 'a Department of Pathology, University of Utah , Salt Lake City , Utah , United States.', 'a Department of Pathology, University of Utah , Salt Lake City , Utah , United States.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20180116,England,Fetal Pediatr Pathol,Fetal and pediatric pathology,101230972,,['NOTNLM'],"['B-lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma', 'lymphomatoid granulomatosis', 'pediatric', 'trisomy 21']",2018/01/18 06:00,2018/08/29 06:00,['2018/01/17 06:00'],"['2018/01/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/08/29 06:00 [medline]', '2018/01/17 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/15513815.2017.1379042 [doi]'],ppublish,Fetal Pediatr Pathol. 2018 Feb;37(1):7-14. doi: 10.1080/15513815.2017.1379042.

Transplant-related mortality (TRM) after HSCT depends mainly on the toxicity of the conditioning regimen, infections, and graft-versus-host disease. The purpose of this study was to identify the association between CTLA-4 single nucleotide polymorphisms and TRM in children undergoing allogeneic HSCT. METHODS: 153 donors and 153 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia or juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia who had undergone allogeneic HSCT were genotyped of CTLA-4 gene for rs3087243 (CT60G>A), rs231775 (+ 49 A>G) and rs4553808 using TaqMan real-time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: We observed a significant association between the donor's CLTA-4 genotype of rs3087243 and TRM in children undergoing allogeneic HSCT. Genotype AG was found in 78 donors (51%), GG in 44 donors (29%) and 31 donors (20%) were homozygous for AA. 30 patients died as a result of transplant-related causes. Interestingly, we observed a significantly reduced TRM in children who were transplanted from a donor with the CTLA-4 genotype GG in comparison to genotype AG or AA (9 versus 19 versus 36%, P = 0.013). In addition, we found significant differences of event-free survival (EFS) depending on the donor's genotype. The EFS was 64, 46 or 32% if the patient was transplanted from a donor with CTLA-4 genotype GG, AG or AA, respectively (P = 0.043). In multivariate analysis, CTLA-4 genotype of rs3087243 was an independent risk factor for TRM (P = 0.011) and EFS (P = 0.035). CONCLUSION: This study provides first evidence that the CTLA-4 polymorphisms are significant risk factors for TRM and survival in children undergoing allogeneic HSCT and should be evaluated in further trials.","['Hammrich, Judith', 'Wittig, Susan', 'Ernst, Thomas', 'Gruhn, Bernd']","['Hammrich J', 'Wittig S', 'Ernst T', 'Gruhn B']","['Department of Pediatrics, Jena University Hospital, Am Klinikum 1, 07747, Jena, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Jena University Hospital, Am Klinikum 1, 07747, Jena, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine Il, Jena University Hospital, Jena, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Jena University Hospital, Am Klinikum 1, 07747, Jena, Germany.

Donor-specific anti-HLA antibodies (DSA) have been recently recognized as an important barrier against successful engraftment of donor cells, which can affect transplant survival. DSA appear more prevalent in this type of transplant due to higher likelihood of alloimmunization of multiparous females against offspring's HLA antigens, and the degree of mismatch. Here we summarize the evidence for the role of DSA in the development of primary graft failure in haploidentical transplantation and provide consensus recommendations from the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplant Group on testing, monitoring, and treatment of patients with DSA receiving haploidentical hematopoietic progenitor cell transplantation.","['Ciurea, Stefan O', 'Cao, Kai', 'Fernandez-Vina, Marcelo', 'Kongtim, Piyanuch', 'Malki, Monzr Al', 'Fuchs, Ephraim', 'Luznik, Leo', 'Huang, Xiao-Jun', 'Ciceri, Fabio', 'Locatelli, Franco', 'Aversa, Franco', 'Castagna, Luca', 'Bacigalupo, Andrea', 'Martelli, Massimo', 'Blaise, Didier', 'Handgretinger, Rupert', 'Roy, Denis-Claude', ""O'Donnell, Paul"", 'Bashey, Asad', 'Lazarus, Hillard M', 'Ballen, Karen', 'Savani, Bipin N', 'Mohty, Mohamad', 'Nagler, Arnon']","['Ciurea SO', 'Cao K', 'Fernandez-Vina M', 'Kongtim P', 'Malki MA', 'Fuchs E', 'Luznik L', 'Huang XJ', 'Ciceri F', 'Locatelli F', 'Aversa F', 'Castagna L', 'Bacigalupo A', 'Martelli M', 'Blaise D', 'Handgretinger R', 'Roy DC', ""O'Donnell P"", 'Bashey A', 'Lazarus HM', 'Ballen K', 'Savani BN', 'Mohty M', 'Nagler A']","['The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA. sciurea@mdanderson.org.', 'The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.', 'Thammasat University, Bangkok, Thailand.', 'Department of Hematology and HCT, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, CA, USA.', 'Division of Hematologic Malignancies, Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'Division of Hematologic Malignancies, Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins, Baltimore, MD, USA.', ""Institute of Hematology, Peking University People's Hospital, Beijing, China."", 'Hematology and BMT Unit, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, IRCCS Ospedale Pediatrico Bambino Gesu, Rome, Italy.', 'Hematology and BMT Unit, University of Parma, Parma, Italy.', 'Hematology Department, Humanitas Clinical and Research Center, Milan, Italy.', ""Instituto di Ematologia, Fondazione Policlinico Universitario Gemelli, Universita' Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, Roma, Italy."", 'University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.', ""Departement D'Hematologie, Programme de Transplantation et de Therapie Cellulaire, Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie de Marseille, Institut Paoli Calmettes, Marseille, France."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Children's University Hospital, Tubingen, Germany."", 'Blood and Marrow Transplantation Program, Hopital Maisonneuve-Rosemont, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center, Boston, MA, USA.', 'BMT Program at Northside Hospital, Atlanta, GA, USA.', 'Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'University of Virginia Health System, Charlottesville, VA, USA.', 'Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA.', 'Hopital Saint-Antoine, Paris, France.', 'Hematology Division, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel Hashomer, Israel.', 'Acute Leukemia Working Party of the EBMT, Hopital Saint-Antoine, Paris, France.']",['eng'],['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Practice Guideline', 'Review']",20180115,England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,PMC7232774,,,2018/01/18 06:00,2019/05/16 06:00,['2018/01/17 06:00'],"['2017/10/23 00:00 [received]', '2017/11/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/11/11 00:00 [revised]', '2018/01/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/16 06:00 [medline]', '2018/01/17 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41409-017-0062-8 [doi]', '10.1038/s41409-017-0062-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2018 May;53(5):521-534. doi: 10.1038/s41409-017-0062-8.

However, there are limited solid evidences available for the optimal timing and dose of progesterone therapy, especially for the possible adverse effects on implantation and decidualization when progesterone is administrated empirically. In our study, mouse models were used to examine effects of excess progesterone on embryo implantation and decidualization. Our data indicate that excess progesterone is not only harmful for mouse implantation, but also impairs mouse decidualization. In excess progesterone-treated mice, the impaired LIF/STAT3 pathway and dysregulated endoplasmic reticulum stress may lead to the inhibition of embryo implantation and decidualization. It is possible that the decrease in birth weight of excess progesterone-treated mice is due to a compromised embryo implantation and decidualization. Furthermore, excess progesterone compromises in vitro decidualization of human endometrial stromal cells.","['Liang, Yu-Xiang', 'Liu, Li', 'Jin, Zhi-Yong', 'Liang, Xiao-Huan', 'Fu, Yong-Sheng', 'Gu, Xiao-Wei', 'Yang, Zeng-Ming']","['Liang YX', 'Liu L', 'Jin ZY', 'Liang XH', 'Fu YS', 'Gu XW', 'Yang ZM']","['College of Veterinary Medicine, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, 510642, China.', 'College of Veterinary Medicine, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, 510642, China.', 'College of Veterinary Medicine, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, 510642, China.', 'College of Veterinary Medicine, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, 510642, China.', 'College of Veterinary Medicine, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, 510642, China.', 'College of Veterinary Medicine, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, 510642, China.', 'College of Veterinary Medicine, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, 510642, China. zmyang@scau.edu.cn.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180115,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,PMC5768702,,,2018/01/18 06:00,2018/11/21 06:00,['2018/01/17 06:00'],"['2017/06/06 00:00 [received]', '2017/12/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/01/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/11/21 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-017-18643-w [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-017-18643-w [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2018 Jan 15;8(1):712. doi: 10.1038/s41598-017-18643-w.,20181120,1,"['0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Progestins)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', '4G7DS2Q64Y (Progesterone)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Embryo Implantation/*drug effects', 'Endometrium/*drug effects/*physiology', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Mice', 'Progesterone/*metabolism', 'Progestins/*metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'Stromal Cells/drug effects/physiology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DNA samples from ALL patients (aged 0-19 years) previously enrolled onto a Tokyo Children's Cancer Study Group trial were collected during 2013-2015, and underwent single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) microarray genotyping resulting in 527 B-cell ALL for analysis. Cases and control data for 3,882 samples from the Nagahama Study Group and Aichi Cancer Center Study were combined, and association analyses across 10 previous GWAS-identified regions were performed after targeted SNP imputation. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) patterns in Japanese and other populations were evaluated using the varLD score based on 1000 Genomes data. Risk associations for ARID5B (rs10821936, OR = 1.84, P = 6 x 10(-17)) and PIP4K2A (rs7088318, OR = 0.76, P = 2 x 10(-4)) directly transferred to Japanese, and the IKZF1 association was detected by an alternate SNP (rs1451367, OR = 1.52, P = 2 x 10(-6)). Marked regional LD differences between Japanese and Europeans was observed for most of the remaining loci for which associations did not transfer, including CEBPE, CDKN2A, CDKN2B, and ELK3.

While a distinctive feature of MCL1 resides in its efficient ubiquitination and destruction, the deubiquitinase USP9X has been implicated in the preservation of MCL1 expression by removing the polyubiquitin chains. Here we perform an unbiased siRNA screen and identify that the second deubiquitinase, USP13, regulates MCL1 stability in lung and ovarian cancer cells. Mechanistically, USP13 interacts with and stabilizes MCL1 via deubiquitination. As a result, USP13 depletion using CRISPR/Cas9 nuclease system inhibits tumor growth in xenografted nude mice. We further report that genetic or pharmacological inhibition of USP13 considerably reduces MCL1 protein abundance and significantly increases tumor cell sensitivity to BH3 mimetic inhibitors targeting BCL-2 and BCL-XL. Collectively, we nominate USP13 as a novel deubiquitinase which regulates MCL1 turnover in diverse solid tumors and propose that USP13 may be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of various malignancies.","['Zhang, Shengzhe', 'Zhang, Meiying', 'Jing, Ying', 'Yin, Xia', 'Ma, Pengfei', 'Zhang, Zhenfeng', 'Wang, Xiaojie', 'Di, Wen', 'Zhuang, Guanglei']","['Zhang S', 'Zhang M', 'Jing Y', 'Yin X', 'Ma P', 'Zhang Z', 'Wang X', 'Di W', 'Zhuang G']","['State Key Laboratory of Oncogenes and Related Genes, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Ren Ji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, 200127, China.', 'School of Biomedical Engineering & Med-X Research Institute, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, 200240, China.', 'Shanghai Key Laboratory of Gynecologic Oncology, Ren Ji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, 200127, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Oncogenes and Related Genes, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Ren Ji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, 200127, China.', 'Shanghai Key Laboratory of Gynecologic Oncology, Ren Ji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, 200127, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Oncogenes and Related Genes, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Ren Ji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, 200127, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Oncogenes and Related Genes, Shanghai Cancer Institute, Ren Ji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, 200032, China.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Tongren Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200050, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Oncogenes and Related Genes, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Ren Ji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, 200127, China.', 'Shanghai Key Laboratory of Gynecologic Oncology, Ren Ji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, 200127, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Oncogenes and Related Genes, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Ren Ji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, 200127, China. zhuangguanglei@gmail.com.', 'Shanghai Key Laboratory of Gynecologic Oncology, Ren Ji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, 200127, China. zhuangguanglei@gmail.com.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180115,England,Nat Commun,Nature communications,101528555,PMC5768685,,,2018/01/18 06:00,2018/03/06 06:00,['2018/01/17 06:00'],"['2017/05/02 00:00 [received]', '2017/12/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/01/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/06 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41467-017-02693-9 [doi]', '10.1038/s41467-017-02693-9 [pii]']",epublish,Nat Commun. 2018 Jan 15;9(1):215. doi: 10.1038/s41467-017-02693-9.,20180305,1,"['0 (Aniline Compounds)', '0 (Benzylamines)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Quinazolines)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '0 (spautin-1)', 'EC 3.4.- (Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.19.12 (USP13 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.19.12 (Ubiquitin-Specific Proteases)', 'XKJ5VVK2WD (navitoclax)']",IM,"['Aniline Compounds/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Benzylamines/pharmacology', 'CRISPR-Cas Systems', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Endopeptidases/genetics/*metabolism', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Quinazolines/pharmacology', 'RNA Interference', 'Sulfonamides/pharmacology', 'Ubiquitin-Specific Proteases', 'Ubiquitination/drug effects', '*Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays', 'bcl-X Protein/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8141-5096'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, activating mutations or gene rearrangements among MAPK signaling components, such as Ras and Raf, are not always observed in cancers with hyperactivated MAPK. The mechanisms underlying MAPK activation in these cancers remain largely elusive. Here we discover that genomic amplification of the PPP1CA gene is highly enriched in metastatic human CaP. We further identify an S6K/PP1alpha/B-Raf signaling pathway leading to activation of MAPK signaling that is antagonized by the PML tumor suppressor. Mechanistically, we find that PP1alpha acts as a B-Raf activating phosphatase and that PML suppresses MAPK activation by sequestering PP1alpha into PML nuclear bodies, hence repressing S6K-dependent PP1alpha phosphorylation, 14-3-3 binding and cytoplasmic accumulation. Our findings therefore reveal a PP1alpha/PML molecular network that is genetically altered in human cancer towards aberrant MAPK activation, with important therapeutic implications.","['Chen, Ming', 'Wan, Lixin', 'Zhang, Jiangwen', 'Zhang, Jinfang', 'Mendez, Lourdes', 'Clohessy, John G', 'Berry, Kelsey', 'Victor, Joshua', 'Yin, Qing', 'Zhu, Yuan', 'Wei, Wenyi', 'Pandolfi, Pier Paolo']","['Chen M', 'Wan L', 'Zhang J', 'Zhang J', 'Mendez L', 'Clohessy JG', 'Berry K', 'Victor J', 'Yin Q', 'Zhu Y', 'Wei W', 'Pandolfi PP']","['Cancer Research Institute, Beth Israel Deaconess Cancer Center, Department of Medicine and Pathology, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, 02215, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, 02115, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Oncology, H.

Accordingly, MKL plays important roles in dendritic morphology, neuronal migration, and brain development. Further, nucleotide substitutions in the MKL1 and MKL2 genes are found in patients with schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorder, respectively. Thus, studies on the precise synaptic localisation and function of MKL in neurons are warranted. In this study, we generated and tested new antibodies that specifically recognise endogenously expressed MKL1 and MKL2 proteins in neurons. Using these reagents, we biochemically and immunocytochemically show that MKL1 and MKL2 are localised at synapses. Furthermore, shRNA experiments revealed that postsynaptic deletion of MKL1 or MKL2 reduced the percentage of mushroom- or stubby-type spines in cultured neurons. Taken together, our findings suggest that MKL1 and MKL2 are present at synapses and involved in dendritic spine maturation. This study may, at least in part, contribute to better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying MKL-mediated synaptic plasticity and neurological disorders.","['Kaneda, Marisa', 'Sakagami, Hiroyuki', 'Hida, Yamato', 'Ohtsuka, Toshihisa', 'Satou, Natsumi', 'Ishibashi, Yuta', 'Fukuchi, Mamoru', 'Krysiak, Anna', 'Ishikawa, Mitsuru', 'Ihara, Daisuke', 'Kalita, Katarzyna', 'Tabuchi, Akiko']","['Kaneda M', 'Sakagami H', 'Hida Y', 'Ohtsuka T', 'Satou N', 'Ishibashi Y', 'Fukuchi M', 'Krysiak A', 'Ishikawa M', 'Ihara D', 'Kalita K', 'Tabuchi A']","['Laboratory of Molecular Neurobiology, Graduate School of Medicine and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Toyama, 2630 Sugitani, Toyama, 930-0194, Japan.', 'Department of Anatomy, Kitasato University School of Medicine, Sagamihara, Kanagawa, 252-0734, Japan.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Graduate School of Medicine, University of Yamanashi, 1110 Shimokato, Chuo, Yamanashi, 409-3898, Japan.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Graduate School of Medicine, University of Yamanashi, 1110 Shimokato, Chuo, Yamanashi, 409-3898, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Neurobiology, Graduate School of Medicine and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Toyama, 2630 Sugitani, Toyama, 930-0194, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Neurobiology, Graduate School of Medicine and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Toyama, 2630 Sugitani, Toyama, 930-0194, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Neurobiology, Graduate School of Medicine and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Toyama, 2630 Sugitani, Toyama, 930-0194, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Neuroscience, Faculty of Pharmacy, Takasaki University of Health and Welfare, 60 Nakaorui-machi, Takasaki, Gunma, 370-0033, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Neurobiology, Department of Molecular and Cellular Neurobiology, Nencki Institute of Experimental Biology, Polish Academy of Sciences, 3 Pasteur Street, 02-093, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Neurobiology, Graduate School of Medicine and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Toyama, 2630 Sugitani, Toyama, 930-0194, Japan.', 'Department of Physiology, Keio University, School of Medicine, 35 Shinanomachi, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo, 160-8582, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Neurobiology, Graduate School of Medicine and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Toyama, 2630 Sugitani, Toyama, 930-0194, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Neurobiology, Department of Molecular and Cellular Neurobiology, Nencki Institute of Experimental Biology, Polish Academy of Sciences, 3 Pasteur Street, 02-093, Warsaw, Poland. k.kalita@nencki.gov.pl.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Neurobiology, Graduate School of Medicine and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Toyama, 2630 Sugitani, Toyama, 930-0194, Japan. atabuchi@pha.u-toyama.ac.jp.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180115,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,PMC5768758,,,2018/01/18 06:00,2018/11/21 06:00,['2018/01/17 06:00'],"['2017/08/07 00:00 [received]', '2017/12/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/01/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/11/21 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-017-18905-7 [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-017-18905-7 [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2018 Jan 15;8(1):727. doi: 10.1038/s41598-017-18905-7.,20181120,1,"['0 (MRTFA protein, human)', '0 (MRTFB protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Dendritic Spines/*metabolism', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Neurons/*chemistry/*cytology', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics/metabolism', 'Synapses/*chemistry', 'Trans-Activators/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As a result, low avidity T cells escape from thymic deletion. This incomplete thymic deletion occurs to the T cells developing de novo in the thymus of H60-positive recipients in H60-mismatched bone marrow transplantation (BMT). H60-specific thymic deletion escapee CD8(+) T cells exhibit effector differentiation potentials in the periphery and contribute to graft-versus-leukemia effects in the recipients of H60-mismatched BMT, regressing H60(+) hematological tumors.

METHODS: The data of pediatric cancer in Jiangxi in 2010 and 2015 were collected from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2015 in China, including number of cases, number of deaths, years of life lost (YLL), years lived with disability (YLD), and disability-adjusted life years (DALY). The standardized incidence rate, mortality rate, and DALY rate were calculated with the national census data in 2010 as the standard population, in order to evaluate the changes in incidence, mortality, and disease burden of pediatric cancer in Jiangxi. RESULTS: In both 2010 and 2015, boys had higher numbers of cases, deaths, and DALY than girls, and the 5-14 years group had higher numbers than the 0-4 years group; boys had higher incidence rate, mortality rate, and DALY rate than girls, and the 0-4 years group had higher rates than the 5-14 years group. In 2015, the standardized incidence rate of pediatric cancer was reduced by 6.66% in the 0-4 years group and 17.56% in the 5-14 years group; the standardized mortality rate was reduced by 11.34% in the 0-4 years group and 21.78% in the 5-14 years group; the standardized DALY rate was reduced by 11.27% in the 0-4 years group and 21.67% in the 5-14 years group. Among the different types of pediatric cancer, leukemia had the highest standardized DALY rate in 2010 and 2015, followed by brain cancer and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. CONCLUSIONS: There was a certain reduction in the burden of pediatric cancer in Jiangxi from 2010 to 2015. Leukemia, brain cancer, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma are the focus of prevention and treatment, and children aged less than 5 years and boys should be closely monitored.","['Xu, Gang', 'Chen, Ying', 'Liu, Jie', 'Liu, Shi-Wei', 'Wang, Ping', 'Yang, Jing', 'Huang, Jiu-Ling']","['Xu G', 'Chen Y', 'Liu J', 'Liu SW', 'Wang P', 'Yang J', 'Huang JL']","['Department of Preventive Medicine, School of Basic Medicine, Jiangxi University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Nanchang 330004, China. yingch2013@163.com.']",['chi'],,['Journal Article'],,China,Zhongguo Dang Dai Er Ke Za Zhi,Zhongguo dang dai er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of contemporary pediatrics,100909956,PMC7390322,,,2018/01/18 06:00,2018/04/11 06:00,['2018/01/17 06:00'],"['2018/01/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/01/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/04/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.7499/j.issn.1008-8830.2018.01.005 [pii]'],ppublish,Zhongguo Dang Dai Er Ke Za Zhi. 2018 Jan;20(1):21-27.,20180410,1,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'China/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/mortality', 'Time Factors']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, it was reported that Bcl3 positively regulates pluripotency genes, including Oct4, in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). However, the role of Bcl3 in the maintenance of pluripotency and self-renewal activity is not fully established. Here, we report the dynamic regulation of the proliferation, pluripotency, and self-renewal of mESCs by Bcl3 via an influence on Nanog transcriptional activity. Bcl3 expression is predominantly observed in immature mESCs, but significantly decreased during cell differentiation by LIF depletion and in mESC-derived EBs. Importantly, the knockdown of Bcl3 resulted in the loss of self-renewal ability and decreased cell proliferation. Similarly, the ectopic expression of Bcl3 also resulted in a significant reduction of proliferation, and the self-renewal of mESCs was demonstrated by alkaline phosphatase staining and clonogenic single cell-derived colony assay. We further examined that Bcl3-mediated regulation of Nanog transcriptional activity in mESCs, which indicated that Bcl3 acts as a transcriptional repressor of Nanog expression in mESCs. In conclusion, we demonstrated that a sufficient concentration of Bcl3 in mESCs plays a critical role in the maintenance of pluripotency and the self-renewal of mESCs via the regulation of Nanog transcriptional activity.

This study demonstrates a variation in LRP16 with estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) in prolactinoma models and the up and downregulation effects of LRP16 on prolactin secretion of pituitary adenomas cells (GH3 cells). In our study, 50 male SD rats (30-day-old) were randomly divided into five groups of 10 rats each. After 120 days of treatment, the rats were sacrificed, and the expression of LRP16 and ERalpha were examined by Western blot and immunohistochemistry to explore the changes in ERalpha, LRP16, and prolactin. After siRNA transfection of the respective genes, the GH3 cells were cultured, and their secretory function as well as the expression of ERalpha mRNA and prolactin were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and real-time-polymerase chain reaction analysis. The results show that secretion of prolactin by GH3 cells can be affected by up and downregulating LRP16 expression, which may provide a novel medical therapy in clinical trials.","['Su, Xing', 'Wu, Zhi Qiang', 'Yang, Xiao Jiang', 'Wang, An Ping', 'Zhao, Kun', 'Wu, Tao Guang', 'Sun, Yi', 'Sun, Jie', 'Chang, Zheng Yao', 'Guo, Xiao Yong', 'Guo, Qing Hua', 'Mu, Yi Ming']","['Su X', 'Wu ZQ', 'Yang XJ', 'Wang AP', 'Zhao K', 'Wu TG', 'Sun Y', 'Sun J', 'Chang ZY', 'Guo XY', 'Guo QH', 'Mu YM']","['Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing 100853, China.', 'Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing 100853, China.', ""Xijing Hospital of Air Force Military Medical University, Xi'an 710032, Shaanxi, China."", 'Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing 100853, China.', 'Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing 100853, China.', 'Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing 100853, China.', 'Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing 100853, China.', 'Chinese PLA 302 Hospital, Beijing 100039, China.', 'Chinese PLA 302 Hospital, Beijing 100039, China.', 'Hangzhou Sanatorium of Chinese PLA, Hangzhou 310007, Zhejiang, China.', 'Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing 100853, China; Hainan Branch of Chinese PLA General Hospital, Sanya 572013, Hainan China.', 'Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing 100853, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,China,Biomed Environ Sci,Biomedical and environmental sciences : BES,8909524,,,,2018/01/18 06:00,2019/05/09 06:00,['2018/01/17 06:00'],"['2017/06/11 00:00 [received]', '2017/11/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/01/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3967/bes2017.127 [doi]'],ppublish,Biomed Environ Sci. 2017 Dec;30(12):938-942. doi: 10.3967/bes2017.127.,20190508,12,"['0 (Estrogen Receptor alpha)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '9002-62-4 (Prolactin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Down-Regulation', 'Estrogen Receptor alpha/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Pituitary Neoplasms/*metabolism', 'Prolactin/*metabolism', 'Prolactinoma/*metabolism', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Up-Regulation']",,"['Copyright (c) 2017 The Editorial Board of Biomedical and Environmental Sciences.', 'Published by China CDC.

In this context, measurement of the stem cell marker aldehyde-dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity can distinguish poor prognosis cases with increased fractions of ALDH-positive cells (ALDH-numerous AML) and favorable outcome cases with low percentages (ALDH-rare AML). It has been shown that ALDH-numerous AML favor leukemic engraftment in xenotransplantation assays which suggests increased leukemic stem cell (LSC) potential. To test if this reflects an immature cell of origin, comparative gene-expression studies of CD34(+) leukemic blasts were performed. This analysis revealed increased expression of LSC and HSC signatures in ALDH-numerous AML, whereas ALDH-rare AML were enriched for a progenitor signature. The enrichment of stemness-associated transcriptional programs suggests that ALDH-numerous AML derive from immature hematopoietic progenitors and offers an explanation for the poor prognosis and therapy resistance of this subgroup which is likely caused by inherited stem cell properties.","['Blume, Rachel', 'Rempel, Eugen', 'Manta, Linda', 'Saeed, Borhan R', 'Wang, Wenwen', 'Raffel, Simon', 'Ermakova, Olga', 'Eckstein, Volker', 'Benes, Vladimir', 'Trumpp, Andreas', 'Ho, Anthony D', 'Lutz, Christoph']","['Blume R', 'Rempel E', 'Manta L', 'Saeed BR', 'Wang W', 'Raffel S', 'Ermakova O', 'Eckstein V', 'Benes V', 'Trumpp A', 'Ho AD', 'Lutz C']","['a Department of Medicine V , Heidelberg University , Heidelberg , Germany.', 'b Centre for Organismal Studies , Heidelberg University , Heidelberg , Germany.', 'a Department of Medicine V , Heidelberg University , Heidelberg , Germany.', 'a Department of Medicine V , Heidelberg University , Heidelberg , Germany.', 'a Department of Medicine V , Heidelberg University , Heidelberg , Germany.', 'a Department of Medicine V , Heidelberg University , Heidelberg , Germany.', 'c Division of Stem Cells and Cancer , Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum (DKFZ) , Heidelberg , Germany.', 'd Heidelberg Institute for Stem Cell Technology and Experimental Medicine (HI-STEM gGmbH) , Heidelberg , Germany.', 'b Centre for Organismal Studies , Heidelberg University , Heidelberg , Germany.', 'a Department of Medicine V , Heidelberg University , Heidelberg , Germany.', 'e European Molecular Biology Laboratory , Heidelberg , Germany.', 'c Division of Stem Cells and Cancer , Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum (DKFZ) , Heidelberg , Germany.', 'd Heidelberg Institute for Stem Cell Technology and Experimental Medicine (HI-STEM gGmbH) , Heidelberg , Germany.', 'a Department of Medicine V , Heidelberg University , Heidelberg , Germany.', 'a Department of Medicine V , Heidelberg University , Heidelberg , Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180116,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,['NOTNLM'],"['*ALDH', '*Acute myeloid leukemia', '*gene-expression', '*leukemia stem cell']",2018/01/18 06:00,2019/03/19 06:00,['2018/01/17 06:00'],"['2018/01/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/19 06:00 [medline]', '2018/01/17 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10428194.2017.1422862 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2018 Sep;59(9):2201-2210. doi: 10.1080/10428194.2017.1422862.

It's deficiency leads to multiple types of aggressive cancer. Sezary syndrome, a leukemic variant of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, is characterized by its resistance to apoptosis. Although the cause of apoptosis resistance is still poorly understood, recent evidence has revealed the importance of SATB1 in the apoptosis resistance of Sezary syndrome. In this study, we show that SNF5 is an upstream regulator of SATB1 in several conditions and that both are deficient in Sezary cells. Additionally, SNF5 not only controls the expression of SATB1, but also utilizes SATB1 to recruit itself to specific sites. Overexpression of SNF5 induces SATB1 expression and partially reverse apoptosis resistance phenotype in Sezary cells. These results suggest that both SNF5 and SATB1 may regulate apoptosis-related genes in Sezary syndrome. Thus, targeting SWI/SNF complex may represent a promising approach for Sezary syndrome therapy.","['Li, Yang', 'Wang, Jin', 'Yu, Minghang', 'Wang, Yang', 'Zhang, Huilai', 'Yin, Jie', 'Li, Zexing', 'Li, Ting', 'Yan, Han', 'Li, Fajin', 'Wang, Xi']","['Li Y', 'Wang J', 'Yu M', 'Wang Y', 'Zhang H', 'Yin J', 'Li Z', 'Li T', 'Yan H', 'Li F', 'Wang X']","['a Department of Cell Biology , 2011 Collaborative Innovation Center of Tianjin for Medical Epigenetics, Laboratory of Epigenetics in Development and Tumorigenesis, Tianjin Research Center of Basic Medical Sciences, Tianjin Key Laboratory of Medical Epigenetics, Tianjin Medical University , Tianjin , China.', 'a Department of Cell Biology , 2011 Collaborative Innovation Center of Tianjin for Medical Epigenetics, Laboratory of Epigenetics in Development and Tumorigenesis, Tianjin Research Center of Basic Medical Sciences, Tianjin Key Laboratory of Medical Epigenetics, Tianjin Medical University , Tianjin , China.', 'a Department of Cell Biology , 2011 Collaborative Innovation Center of Tianjin for Medical Epigenetics, Laboratory of Epigenetics in Development and Tumorigenesis, Tianjin Research Center of Basic Medical Sciences, Tianjin Key Laboratory of Medical Epigenetics, Tianjin Medical University , Tianjin , China.', 'b Department of Dermatology and Venerology , Peking University First Hospital , Beijing , China.', 'c Departments of Lymphoma , Sino-US Center for Lymphoma and Leukemia, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, National Clinical Research Center of Cancer, Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy , Tianjin , China.', 'a Department of Cell Biology , 2011 Collaborative Innovation Center of Tianjin for Medical Epigenetics, Laboratory of Epigenetics in Development and Tumorigenesis, Tianjin Research Center of Basic Medical Sciences, Tianjin Key Laboratory of Medical Epigenetics, Tianjin Medical University , Tianjin , China.', 'a Department of Cell Biology , 2011 Collaborative Innovation Center of Tianjin for Medical Epigenetics, Laboratory of Epigenetics in Development and Tumorigenesis, Tianjin Research Center of Basic Medical Sciences, Tianjin Key Laboratory of Medical Epigenetics, Tianjin Medical University , Tianjin , China.', 'a Department of Cell Biology , 2011 Collaborative Innovation Center of Tianjin for Medical Epigenetics, Laboratory of Epigenetics in Development and Tumorigenesis, Tianjin Research Center of Basic Medical Sciences, Tianjin Key Laboratory of Medical Epigenetics, Tianjin Medical University , Tianjin , China.', 'a Department of Cell Biology , 2011 Collaborative Innovation Center of Tianjin for Medical Epigenetics, Laboratory of Epigenetics in Development and Tumorigenesis, Tianjin Research Center of Basic Medical Sciences, Tianjin Key Laboratory of Medical Epigenetics, Tianjin Medical University , Tianjin , China.', 'd School of Biomedical Engineering and Technology , Tianjin Medical University , Tianjin , China.', 'a Department of Cell Biology , 2011 Collaborative Innovation Center of Tianjin for Medical Epigenetics, Laboratory of Epigenetics in Development and Tumorigenesis, Tianjin Research Center of Basic Medical Sciences, Tianjin Key Laboratory of Medical Epigenetics, Tianjin Medical University , Tianjin , China.', 'e Department of Immunology, School of Basic Medical Sciences , Capital Medical University , Beijing , P.

Here, we demonstrated that vibsanol A, a vibsane-type diterpenoid, inhibited the growth of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells via induction of cell differentiation, which was characterized by G1 cell cycle arrest. The differentiation-inducing effects of vibsanol A were dependent upon protein kinase C (PKC) activation, and subsequent activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway. Furthermore, vibsanol A treatment increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, and the ROS scavenger NAC reversed the vibsanol A-induced cell differentiation, indicating an important role for ROS in the action of vibsanol A. Finally, vibsanol A exhibited a differentiation-enhancing effect when used in combination with all-trans retinoic acid in AML cells. Overall results suggested that vibsanol A induces AML cell differentiation via activation of the PKC/ERK signaling and induction of ROS.

Here we used the lithium, a GSK-3 inhibitor, to attempt to potentiate the effects of nilotinib against leukemia cells. For this purpose, a K562 leukemia cell line and bone marrow cells from untreated Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) patients, prior to any exposure to TKIs, were used as a model. Our results demonstrated that the combination of lithium+nilotinib (L+N) induced K562-cell death and cleaved caspase-3 when compared to lithium or nilotinib alone, accompanied by GSK-3beta phosphorylation and Bcr-Abl oncoprotein levels reduction. Interestingly, these events were related to autophagy induction, expressed by increased LC3II protein levels in the group treated with L+N. Furthermore, the clonogenic capacity of progenitor cells from CML patients was drastically reduced by L+N, as well as lithium and nilotinib when used separately. The number of cell aggregates (clusters), were increased by all treatments (L+N, lithium, and nilotinib). This pioneering research has demonstrated that lithium might be of therapeutic value when targeting Bcr-Abl cells with nilotinib because it triggers cell death in addition to exerting classical antiproliferative effects, opening new perspectives for novel target and therapeutic approaches to eradicate CML.","['Peixoto-da-Silva, Janaina', 'Calgarotto, Andrana K', 'Rocha, Katiucha R', 'Palmeira-Dos-Santos, Caroline', 'Smaili, Soraya S', 'Pereira, Gustavo J S', 'Pericole, Fernando V', 'da Silva S Duarte, Adriana', 'Saad, Sara T O', 'Bincoletto, Claudia']","['Peixoto-da-Silva J', 'Calgarotto AK', 'Rocha KR', 'Palmeira-Dos-Santos C', 'Smaili SS', 'Pereira GJS', 'Pericole FV', 'da Silva S Duarte A', 'Saad STO', 'Bincoletto C']","['Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo (UNIFESP), Escola Paulista de Medicina (EPM), Departamento de Farmacologia, Rua Tres de Maio 100, SP, Sao Paulo, CEP: 04044-020, Brazil.', 'Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo (UNIFESP), Escola Paulista de Medicina (EPM), Departamento de Farmacologia, Rua Tres de Maio 100, SP, Sao Paulo, CEP: 04044-020, Brazil; Hematology and Transfusion Medicine Center, University of Campinas/Hemocentro-UNICAMP, Instituto Nacional de Ciencia e Tecnologia do Sangue, Campinas, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo (UNIFESP), Escola Paulista de Medicina (EPM), Departamento de Farmacologia, Rua Tres de Maio 100, SP, Sao Paulo, CEP: 04044-020, Brazil.', 'Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo (UNIFESP), Escola Paulista de Medicina (EPM), Departamento de Farmacologia, Rua Tres de Maio 100, SP, Sao Paulo, CEP: 04044-020, Brazil.', 'Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo (UNIFESP), Escola Paulista de Medicina (EPM), Departamento de Farmacologia, Rua Tres de Maio 100, SP, Sao Paulo, CEP: 04044-020, Brazil.', 'Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo (UNIFESP), Escola Paulista de Medicina (EPM), Departamento de Farmacologia, Rua Tres de Maio 100, SP, Sao Paulo, CEP: 04044-020, Brazil.', 'Hematology and Transfusion Medicine Center, University of Campinas/Hemocentro-UNICAMP, Instituto Nacional de Ciencia e Tecnologia do Sangue, Campinas, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Hematology and Transfusion Medicine Center, University of Campinas/Hemocentro-UNICAMP, Instituto Nacional de Ciencia e Tecnologia do Sangue, Campinas, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Hematology and Transfusion Medicine Center, University of Campinas/Hemocentro-UNICAMP, Instituto Nacional de Ciencia e Tecnologia do Sangue, Campinas, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo (UNIFESP), Escola Paulista de Medicina (EPM), Departamento de Farmacologia, Rua Tres de Maio 100, SP, Sao Paulo, CEP: 04044-020, Brazil.

The mechanism of dasatinib-induced pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is unclear. However, the occurrence of PAH with late onset in CML patients suggests a chronic pathological mechanism with an insidious onset rather than an acute inflammatory or cardiac aetiology. Dasatinib has a broader effect than other TKIs; the major known difference between dasatinib and other TKIs is the additional inhibition of Src family kinases. Therefore, Src inhibition was thought to play a role in the development of dasatinib-induced PAH. However, recently, it was also speculated that chronic dasatinib therapy may cause pulmonary endothelial damage, attenuate hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction responses and increase susceptibility to PAH independently of the Src family kinase-induced mechanism. Dasatinib-induced PAH usually seems to be reversible with the cessation of the drug, and sometimes with PAH-specific treatment strategies. Transthoracic echocardiography can be recommended as a routine screening prior to dasatinib initiation, and this non-invasive procedure can be utilized in patients having signs and symptoms attributable to PAH during dasatinib treatment.","['Ozgur Yurttas, Nurgul', 'Eskazan, Ahmet Emre']","['Ozgur Yurttas N', 'Eskazan AE']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Cerrahpasa Faculty of Medicine, Istanbul University, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Cerrahpasa Faculty of Medicine, Istanbul University, Istanbul, Turkey.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20180306,England,Br J Clin Pharmacol,British journal of clinical pharmacology,7503323,PMC5903230,['NOTNLM'],"['*adverse event', '*chronic myeloid leukaemia', '*dasatinib', '*pulmonary arterial hypertension', '*tyrosine kinase inhibitor']",2018/01/16 06:00,2019/06/25 06:00,['2018/01/16 06:00'],"['2017/07/24 00:00 [received]', '2017/12/29 00:00 [revised]', '2018/01/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/25 06:00 [medline]', '2018/01/16 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/bcp.13508 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Clin Pharmacol. 2018 May;84(5):835-845. doi: 10.1111/bcp.13508.

We analyze the quantitative effects of activation and knockout to calculate genetic interaction and directionality scores for each gene pair. Based on the results from over 100,000 perturbed gene pairs, we reconstruct a directional dependency network for human K562 leukemia cells and demonstrate how our approach allows the determination of directionality in activating genetic interactions.

MATERIALS & METHODS: Five (extremely rare) TCF3-HLF versus five (very similar) TCF3-PBX1 patients were sampled before and after remission and analyzed using reduced representation bisulfite sequencing and RNA-sequencing. RESULTS: We identified 7000 differentially methylated CpG sites between subtypes, of which 78% had lower methylation levels in TCF3-HLF. Gene expression was negatively correlated with CpG sites in 23 genes. KBTBD11 clearly differed in methylation and expression between subtypes and before and after remission in TCF3-HLF samples. CONCLUSION: KBTBD11 hypomethylation may be a promising potential target for further experimental validation especially for the TCF3-HLF subtype.","['Kachroo, Priyadarshini', 'Szymczak, Silke', 'Heinsen, Femke-Anouska', 'Forster, Michael', 'Bethune, Jorn', 'Hemmrich-Stanisak, Georg', 'Baker, Lewis', 'Schrappe, Martin', 'Stanulla, Martin', 'Franke, Andre']","['Kachroo P', 'Szymczak S', 'Heinsen FA', 'Forster M', 'Bethune J', 'Hemmrich-Stanisak G', 'Baker L', 'Schrappe M', 'Stanulla M', 'Franke A']","['Institute of Clinical Molecular Biology, Christian Albrechts University of Kiel, Kiel 24105, Germany.', ""Channing Laboratory, Department of Medicine, Brigham & Women's Hospital & Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA."", 'Institute of Clinical Molecular Biology, Christian Albrechts University of Kiel, Kiel 24105, Germany.', 'Institute of Medical Informatics & Statistics, Christian Albrechts University of Kiel, Kiel 24105, Germany.', 'Institute of Clinical Molecular Biology, Christian Albrechts University of Kiel, Kiel 24105, Germany.', 'Institute of Clinical Molecular Biology, Christian Albrechts University of Kiel, Kiel 24105, Germany.', 'Institute of Clinical Molecular Biology, Christian Albrechts University of Kiel, Kiel 24105, Germany.', 'Institute of Clinical Molecular Biology, Christian Albrechts University of Kiel, Kiel 24105, Germany.', 'Department of Applied Mathematics, University of Colorado, Boulder, CO 80309, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Campus Kiel, Kiel 24105, Germany.', 'Pediatric Hematology & Oncology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover 30625, Germany.', 'Institute of Clinical Molecular Biology, Christian Albrechts University of Kiel, Kiel 24105, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180115,England,Epigenomics,Epigenomics,101519720,,['NOTNLM'],"['*ALL', '*DNA methylation', '*NGS', '*RNA-Seq', '*RRBS', '*epigenetics', '*epigenomics', '*leukemia', '*next-generation sequencing', '*transcriptomics']",2018/01/16 06:00,2019/01/29 06:00,['2018/01/16 06:00'],"['2018/01/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/29 06:00 [medline]', '2018/01/16 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.2217/epi-2017-0080 [doi]'],ppublish,Epigenomics. 2018 Feb;10(2):133-147. doi: 10.2217/epi-2017-0080.

However, the predictors of ALL-associated TE are as yet uncertain. OBJECTIVE: This exploratory, prospective cohort study evaluated the effects of clinical (age, gender, ALL risk group) and laboratory variables (hematological parameters, ABO blood group, inherited and acquired prothrombotic defects [PDs]) at diagnosis on the development of symptomatic TE (sTE) in children (aged 1 to </=18) treated on the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute ALL 05-001 study. PROCEDURES: Samples collected prior to the start of ALL therapy were evaluated for genetic and acquired PDs (proteins C and S, antithrombin, procoagulant factors VIII (FVIII:C), IX, XI and von Willebrand factor antigen levels, gene polymorphisms of factor V G1691A, prothrombin gene G20210A and methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase C677T, anticardiolipin antibodies, fasting lipoprotein(a), and homocysteine). RESULTS: Of 131 enrolled patients (mean age [range] 6.4 [1-17] years) 70 were male patients and 20 patients (15%) developed sTE. Acquired or inherited PD had no impact on the risk of sTE. Multivariable analyses identified older age (odds ratio [OR] 1.13; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.01, 1.26) and non-O blood group (OR 3.64, 95% CI: 1.06, 12.51) as independent predictors for development of sTE. Patients with circulating blasts had higher odds of developing sTE (OR 6.66; 95% CI: 0.82, 53.85). CONCLUSION: Older age, non-O blood group, and presence of circulating blasts, but not PDs, predicted the risk of sTE during ALL therapy. We recommend evaluation of these novel risk factors in the development of ALL-associated TE. If confirmed, these easily accessible variables at diagnosis can help develop a risk-prediction model for ALL-associated TE.","['Athale, Uma H', 'Mizrahi, T', 'Laverdiere, C', 'Nayiager, T', 'Delva, Y-L', 'Foster, G', 'Thabane, L', 'David, M', 'Leclerc, J-M', 'Chan, A K C']","['Athale UH', 'Mizrahi T', 'Laverdiere C', 'Nayiager T', 'Delva YL', 'Foster G', 'Thabane L', 'David M', 'Leclerc JM', 'Chan AKC']","[""Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, McMaster Children's Hospital, Hamilton, ON, Canada."", 'Department of Health Research Methods, Evidence and Impact, McMaster University, Hamilton, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Pediatrics, McMaster University, Hamilton, ON, Canada.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, CHU Ste-Justine, University of Montreal, Montreal, Canada.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, CHU Ste-Justine, University of Montreal, Montreal, Canada.', ""Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, McMaster Children's Hospital, Hamilton, ON, Canada."", 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, CHU Ste-Justine, University of Montreal, Montreal, Canada.', 'Department of Health Research Methods, Evidence and Impact, McMaster University, Hamilton, ON, Canada.', ""Biostatistics Unit, St Joseph's HealthCare, Hamilton, ON, Canada."", 'Department of Health Research Methods, Evidence and Impact, McMaster University, Hamilton, ON, Canada.', ""Biostatistics Unit, St Joseph's HealthCare, Hamilton, ON, Canada."", 'Department of Pediatrics, McMaster University, Hamilton, ON, Canada.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, CHU Ste-Justine, University of Montreal, Montreal, Canada.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, CHU Ste-Justine, University of Montreal, Montreal, Canada.', ""Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, McMaster Children's Hospital, Hamilton, ON, Canada."", 'Department of Pediatrics, McMaster University, Hamilton, ON, Canada.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180115,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,['NOTNLM'],"['*ABO blood group', '*acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*children', '*circulating blasts', '*thromboembolism']",2018/01/16 06:00,2019/05/16 06:00,['2018/01/16 06:00'],"['2017/08/31 00:00 [received]', '2017/11/03 00:00 [revised]', '2017/11/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/16 06:00 [medline]', '2018/01/16 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.26938 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2018 May;65(5):e26938. doi: 10.1002/pbc.26938.

Mechanistic and preclinical evidence warranted evaluation of venetoclax for the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). This work characterized the pharmacokinetics of venetoclax in female subjects with SLE. METHODS: Single (10-500 mg) and multiple (30-600 mg) escalating doses of venetoclax or matching placebo were evaluated using randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled designs (6 active and 2 placebo per dose with 73 unique SLE patients enrolled, 25 of whom enrolled twice). The multiple-dose evaluation consisted of two cycles, each with once-daily dosing for 7 days followed by a 21-day washout. Non-compartmental and population pharmacokinetic analyses of venetoclax serial plasma concentrations were conducted. RESULTS: Venetoclax exhibited approximately dose-proportional exposures, with peak concentrations observed 4-8 h post-dose. Venetoclax steady-state exposures were achieved by day 4 of dosing, and the median area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) accumulation ratio ranged from 1.1 to 1.5. A two-compartment model with first-order absorption and elimination described venetoclax pharmacokinetics. The estimates (95% bootstrap confidence interval) for venetoclax apparent clearance, central and peripheral volumes of distribution, intercompartmental clearance, absorption rate constant, and lag time were 16.3 L/h (14.6-17.9), 37 L (26-57), 122 L (98-183), 3.7 L/h (2.6-5.0), 0.13 h(-1) (0.11-0.17), and 1.6 h (1.6-1.7), respectively. The population estimate for venetoclax terminal-phase elimination half-life was approximately 28 h. CONCLUSIONS: In female subjects with SLE, venetoclax displayed pharmacokinetic characteristics consistent with previous observations in subjects with hematologic malignancies. CLINICALTRIALS.

The initial laboratory analysis revealed hypercalcemia. The patient was referred for whole body bone scan with suspicion of malignancy and bone metastasis. The bone scan revealed highly increased radiotracer uptake in both lungs in the perfusion and blood pool phases. Delayed images also showed increased activity in lungs and gastric wall. The skeleton was not seen clearly. Bone marrow aspiration was done and established the diagnosis of ALL. The patient deceased due to respiratory failure 20 days later. Diffuse lung uptake in this patient was consistent with respiratory failure and poor prognosis.

Patients and methods: Eighty-eight children and adolescents with ALL/NHML were investigated for the influence of SLC 19A1 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and haplotypes on HD-MTX induced toxicities. Results: Patients with rs2838958 TT genotype had higher probability for mucositis development as compared to carriers of at least one rs2838958 C allele (OR 0.226 (0.071-0.725), p < 0.009).

Subjects and Methods: The eight enrolled patients (relapsed/refractory CLL: n = 6 [4/6 patients with del17p] and relapsed/refractory MCL: n = 2) had median age of 55 years (range, 52-60) and had received a median of 3 (CLL patients) and 4 (MCL patients) prior therapies. Patients received once-daily dose of ibrutinib (420 mg: CLL, 560 mg: MCL). Results: In CLL patients, the median time to response was 3 months (range, 0.5-7) and five of six patients had partial response (PR) whereas one achieved complete response (CR). Median time on treatment was 11.5 months (range, 8-14); five patients continued treatment and one was recommended stem cell transplantation (SCT). Of the two MCL patients, one achieved PR and one showed CR and advanced to SCT. In CLL patients, the median (range) hemoglobin level improved from 9.8 g/dL (7.2-11) at baseline to 12.0 g/dL (9.5-13.2) and median (range) platelet count improved from 150,000 cells/muL (21,000-195,000) at baseline to 190,350 cells/muL (130,000-394,000) at the time of analysis (July 2016). Most adverse events (AEs) reported were infections (n = 2). No Grade 3-4 or serious AEs, dose reductions, or treatment discontinuation due to AEs were reported. Conclusions: In this first real-world experience in Indian patients, ibrutinib demonstrated therapeutic efficacy in relapsed/refractory CLL (with/without del17p) and MCL.

We investigated the possible association between DROSHA rs642321 variant and risk of acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL). Materials and Methods: We genotyped 75 children diagnosed with ALL and 115 age- and sex-matched children with no history of cancer of any type (as the control group) by the tetra amplification refractory mutation system-polymerase chain reaction. Results: We found that DROSHA rs642321 C > T variant significantly decreased the risk of ALL in codominant (TT vs. CC: odds ratio [OR] = 0.33, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.14-0.80, P = 0.020) and dominant (TT + CT vs. CC: OR = 0.51, 95% CI = 0.27-0.94, P = 0.037) inheritance model tested. The rs642321 T allele was associated with protective against ALL (OR = 0.58, 95% CI = 0.38-0.88, P = 0.011) in comparison with C allele.

Its myeloablative dose can be safely administered to many patients, including the elderly. Fludarabine-ivBu combination is reported to be comparable or even better than conventional myeloablative conditioning regimens, such as Bu-Cy or TBI-Cy, for those 50 years and older.

In June 2012, the patient was administered with cyclophosphamide as an initial treatment because he developed transfusion-dependent anemia. His anemia improved, and the treatment was discontinued in March 2013. However, anemia recurred in March 2014. The administration of cyclophosphamide was resumed; however, it was subsequently replaced with cyclosporine because of the risk of secondary cancer due to the long-term use of cyclophosphamide. However, his anemia did not improve. Further, the patient was administered with prednisone, methotrexate, and pentostatin; however, the transfusion-dependent state persisted with the cumulative transfusion of 186 RBC units until March 2016. After CD52 expression on the surface of LGL cells was confirmed, treatment with alemtuzumab, which is a monoclonal antibody against CD52, was initiated in April 2016 and the dose was gradually increased from 3 mg to 30 mg thrice per week. The patient's anemia began to improve 1 week after initiating alemtuzumab treatment, and he became transfusion-independent in the second week. Although alemtuzumab treatment was discontinued at the fifth week on the basis of a positive test result for CMV antigenemia, the result consequently became negative after ganciclovir treatment. To date, the patient's hemoglobin level has been maintained at approximately 12 g/dl without any treatment. Herein we reported the case of a patient having LGL leukemia with refractory anemia that was successfully treated using alemtuzumab.","['Iijima, Kimiko', 'Hirao, Masako', 'Hino, Toshiya', 'Kamoda, Yoshimasa', 'Iizuka, Hiromitsu', 'Kida, Michiko', 'Hangaishi, Akira', 'Usuki, Kensuke']","['Iijima K', 'Hirao M', 'Hino T', 'Kamoda Y', 'Iizuka H', 'Kida M', 'Hangaishi A', 'Usuki K']","['Department of Hematology, NTT Medical Center Tokyo.', 'Department of Hematology, NTT Medical Center Tokyo.', 'Department of Hematology, NTT Medical Center Tokyo.', 'Department of Hematology, NTT Medical Center Tokyo.', 'Department of Hematology, NTT Medical Center Tokyo.', 'Department of Hematology, NTT Medical Center Tokyo.', 'Department of Hematology, NTT Medical Center Tokyo.', 'Department of Hematology, NTT Medical Center Tokyo.']",['jpn'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,Japan,Rinsho Ketsueki,[Rinsho ketsueki] The Japanese journal of clinical hematology,2984782R,,['NOTNLM'],"['Alemtuzumab', 'Anemia', 'Large granular lymphocyte leukemia']",2018/01/16 06:00,2018/06/14 06:00,['2018/01/16 06:00'],"['2018/01/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/01/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/06/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.11406/rinketsu.58.2392 [doi]'],ppublish,Rinsho Ketsueki. 2017;58(12):2392-2396. doi: 10.11406/rinketsu.58.2392.,20180613,12,['3A189DH42V (Alemtuzumab)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Alemtuzumab/*therapeutic use', 'Anemia/*drug therapy', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Large Granular Lymphocytic/*therapy', 'Male']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After confirming successful engraftment and achieving complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery, she was subsequently followed up at an outpatient clinic. A routine test performed by day 110 after BMT revealed the presence of pancytopenia. A bone marrow aspirate did not reveal any evidence of disease relapse or hemophagocytic syndrome but demonstrated hematopoietic insufficiency. Donor chimerism also declined over time; thus, the patient was diagnosed with secondary graft failure. Supportive treatment, including granulocyte-colony stimulating factor and blood transfusion, failed to improve the blood parameters.

METHODS: MTT colorimetric bioassay was performed to study the impact of this natural compound on cytotoxicity of both cell types. Moreover, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), inverted phase contrast and fluorescence microscopic techniques were used to study the effects on cell morphology and cellular ultrastructural details connected with apoptosis. The effects of aesculetin on Bcl-2/Bax protein expressions were assessed by Western blot method. RESULTS: Selective and dose-dependent antiproliferative activity of aesculetin in human acute myeloid leukemia cancer cells was observed. However, the compound did not induce significant cell growth inhibition of PBMCs, which were used as normal cell controls. Fluorescence and inverted phase contrast microscopic techniques revealed that aesculetin led to morphological changes suggestive of apoptosis (cell shrinkage, chromatin abridgment and membrane blebbing). TEM analysis showed that aesculetin led to fragmented plasma membrane along with appearance of spherical projections (apoptotic bodies). The wound scratch widened after aesculetin treatment, indicating that aesculetin exhibits anticancer effects by suppressing the cancer cell migration. Aesculetin led to significant and dose-dependent reduction in the Bcl-2 expression while the expression of Bax was significantly enhanced resulting in overall reduction of Bcl-2/Bax ratio. CONCLUSION: The results of the present work revealed that aesculetin exhibits selective anticancer effects in THP-1 human leukemia cells without causing much cytotoxicity in PBMCs. It also led to significant apoptosis induction, inhibition of cancer cell migration and decrease in Blc-2/Bax ratio.","['Gong, Jian', 'Zhang, Wei-Guo', 'Feng, Xiao-Fen', 'Shao, Mei-Juan', 'Xing, Chao']","['Gong J', 'Zhang WG', 'Feng XF', 'Shao MJ', 'Xing C']","[""Medical Laboratory Center, the Second Affiliated Hospital & Yuying Children's Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou 325027, China.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Cyprus,J BUON,Journal of B.U.ON. : official journal of the Balkan Union of Oncology,100883428,,,,2018/01/15 06:00,2019/07/16 06:00,['2018/01/15 06:00'],"['2018/01/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/16 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,J BUON. 2017 Nov-Dec;22(6):1563-1569.,20190715,6,"['0 (BCL2 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Umbelliferones)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'SM2XD6V944 (esculetin)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Caspase 3/genetics', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*genetics', 'Umbelliferones/*pharmacology', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/*genetics']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The life expectancy of such patients has increased, however this favorable event may create enough time for epigenetic events to occur which can cause a new carcinognic event, i.e. a secondary malignancy. The terms in use are second primary malignancies as well as therapy-related neoplasms in case the treatment of the first neoplasm is a direct cause. Second primary malignancies can be hematological neoplasms or solid tumors, with solid tumors having higher frequency. Hematological malignancies, especially t MDS (therapy-related myelodysplastic syndrome) and t AML (therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia), are causally associated with cytotoxic chemotherapy, while secondary solid tumors are related to radiotherapy. The pathogenic mechanisms of clonal selection in second malignancies are in connection with induction of fusion oncogenes, induction of genetic instability, selection of resistant cell clones and hereditary predisposition. The most common oncogenic agents are external (antineoplastic systemic treatments including radiation therapy), patient-specific factors (genetic, demographic, hormonal) and tumorspecific factors (tissue radiosensitivity, immunodeficiency). There are special features in the clinical picture, biological characteristics and evolution of the second neoplasm - different latency period, aggressive course and treatment resistance. Risks, types and characteristics of secondary malignancies are analyzed in specific groups of patients. For example, the peak of t-AML is several years after a primary malignancy and for solid tumors, the risk increases progressively during the observation period. In this review, the authors outline that the risk of second malignancies is predictable and can be controllable by adequate monitoring of patients as well as by personalized treatment of the first neoplasm.","['Nenova, Ivanka', 'Grudeva-Popova, Janet']","['Nenova I', 'Grudeva-Popova J']","['Department of Clinical Oncology, Medical University, Plovdiv, Bulgaria.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Cyprus,J BUON,Journal of B.U.ON. : official journal of the Balkan Union of Oncology,100883428,,,,2018/01/15 06:00,2019/08/01 06:00,['2018/01/15 06:00'],"['2018/01/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/01 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,J BUON. 2017 Nov-Dec;22(6):1378-1384.,20190731,6,['0 (Anticarcinogenic Agents)'],,"['Anticarcinogenic Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Carcinogenesis/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/pathology/*therapy', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*etiology/pathology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Low-dose Vitamin C has also been indicated to induce DNA demethylation at the cellular level. However, little is known whether low-dose Vitamin C has a synergistic effect with decitabine in clinic. METHODS: The effect of combined low-dose Vitamin C and decitabine on cell proliferation, the cell cycle, apoptosis and the expression level and activity of TET2 was investigated in HL60 and NB4 human leukemic cells. Additionally, we analyzed the clinical outcomes of 73 elderly AML patients who received A-DCAG (intravenous Vitamin C [IVC] plus DCAG [n=39]) or DCAG (n=34) treatment. RESULTS: We found that low-dose Vitamin C and decitabine has a synergistic efficacy on proliferation, apoptosis, TET2 expression and activity, compared to drug-alone treatment in HL60 and NB4 cell lines in vitro. In clinic, feasibility and safety evaluations revealed that patients who received A-DCAG regimen have a higher complete remission (CR) rate than those who received the DCAG regimen (79.92% vs. 44.11%; P=0.004) after one cycle of chemotherapy. The median overall survival (OS) was better in the A-DCAG group compared with the DCAG group (15.3 months vs. 9.3 months, P=0.039). Patients with adverse cytogenetics did benefit from CR. There was no clinically significant additional toxicity observed with the addition of IVC. CONCLUSION: On the basis of these results, the addition of IVC at low doses to DCAG appeared to improve CR and prolong OS, compared with DCAG, in elderly patients with AML.","['Zhao, Huihui', 'Zhu, Huayuan', 'Huang, Jiayu', 'Zhu, Yu', 'Hong, Ming', 'Zhu, Han', 'Zhang, Jingjing', 'Li, Shan', 'Yang, Lijia', 'Lian, Yun', 'Wang, Shuai', 'Mao, Jianping', 'Chen, Yaoyu', 'Li, Jianyong', 'Qian, Sixuan']","['Zhao H', 'Zhu H', 'Huang J', 'Zhu Y', 'Hong M', 'Zhu H', 'Zhang J', 'Li S', 'Yang L', 'Lian Y', 'Wang S', 'Mao J', 'Chen Y', 'Li J', 'Qian S']","['Department of Oncology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Southeast University, Nanjing 210003, China; Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing 210029, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing 210029, China; Key Laboratory of Hematology, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing 210029, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing 210029, China; Key Laboratory of Hematology, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing 210029, China; Key Laboratory of Hematology, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing 210029, China; Key Laboratory of Hematology, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing 210029, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing 210029, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing 210029, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing 210029, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing 210029, China; Key Laboratory of Hematology, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing 210029, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing 210029, China; Key Laboratory of Hematology, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing 210029, China; Key Laboratory of Hematology, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing 210029, China; Key Laboratory of Hematology, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China.

Tissues with high rates of cell turnover, such as those in the hematopoietic system, are particularly vulnerable to defects in telomere maintenance genes that eventually culminate in bone marrow (BM) failure syndromes, in which the BM cannot produce sufficient new blood cells. Here, we review how telomere defects induce degenerative phenotypes across multiple organs, with particular focus on how they impact the hematopoietic stem and progenitor compartment and affect hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) self-renewal and differentiation. We also discuss how both the increased risk of myelodysplastic syndromes and other hematological malignancies that is associated with telomere disorders and the discovery of cancer-associated somatic mutations in the shelterin components challenge the conventional interpretation that telomere defects are cancer-protective rather than cancer-promoting.","['Fiorini, Elena', 'Santoni, Andrea', 'Colla, Simona']","['Fiorini E', 'Santoni A', 'Colla S']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.

Sotatercept (ACE-011) is a novel activin receptor type IIA fusion protein that acts as a ligand trap to neutralise negative regulators of late-stage erythropoiesis. The aim of the study was to establish a safe and effective dose of sotatercept for the treatment of anaemia in patients with lower-risk myelodysplastic syndromes. METHODS: This open-label, multicentre, dose-ranging, phase 2 trial took place at 11 treatment centres in the USA and France. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older, had International Prognostic Scoring System-defined low-risk or intermediate-1-risk myelodysplastic syndromes, had anaemia requiring red blood cell (RBC) transfusions, and were ineligible for, or refractory to, erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs). Patients were not eligible if they had chromosome 5q deletion myelodysplastic syndromes without documented failure of lenalidomide. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either 0.1 or 0.3 mg/kg sotatercept subcutaneously, using a permuted-block method with stratification for serum erythropoietin concentration and transfusion burden. Patients were assigned to 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 mg/kg groups in a non-randomised fashion. The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients who achieved haematological improvement-erythroid (HI-E), according to International Working Group 2006 criteria. Efficacy and safety analyses were done in the intention-to-treat population. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01736683 and at EU Clinical Trials Register, number 2012-002601-22, and is ongoing. FINDINGS: Between Dec 5, 2012, and July 22, 2015, 74 patients were enrolled into the study (seven to receive 0.1 mg/kg sotatercept, six to 0.3 mg/kg, 21 to 0.5 mg/kg, 35 to 1.0 mg/kg, and five to 2.0 mg/kg). 36 (49%; 95% CI 38-60) of 74 patients achieved HI-E; 29 (47%; 95% CI 35-59) of 62 patients with a high transfusion burden achieved HI-E (RBC-transfusion reduction from baseline of 4 or more units for at least 56 days), and seven (58%; 95% CI 32-81) of 12 patients with a low transfusion burden achieved HI-E (haemoglobin increase of 1.5 g/dL or more sustained for at least 56 days in the absence of transfusions). The most commonly reported adverse events were fatigue in 19 (26%) of 74 patients and peripheral oedema in 18 (24%) of 74 patients. Grade 3-4 treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were reported in 25 (34%) of 74 patients; four (5%) patients had grade 3-4 TEAEs that were considered to be treatment related. The most common grade 3-4 TEAEs were lipase increase and anaemia, which each occurred in three (4%) of 74 patients. 17 (23%) of 74 patients had at least one serious TEAE, and one patient died from a treatment-emergent subdural haematoma due to a fall. INTERPRETATION: Sotatercept, a novel activin-receptor fusion protein, was well tolerated and effective for the treatment of anaemia in patients with lower-risk myelodysplastic syndromes in whom previous ESA treatment had failed. Treatment with sotatercept could be beneficial for these patients who have few available treatment options.

We determined the sequence of 3196 MHC class I ligands representing 1921 proteins from a panel of 20 breast cancer cell lines. After removing duplicate peptides, i.e., the same peptide eluted from more than one cell line, the total number of unique peptides was 2740. Of the unique peptides eluted, more than 1750 had been previously identified, and of these, sixteen have been shown to be immunogenic. Importantly, half of these immunogenic peptides were shared between different breast cancer cell lines. MHC class I binding probability was used to plot the distribution of the eluted peptides in accordance with the binding score for each breast cancer cell line. We also determined that the tested breast cancer cells presented 89 mutation-containing peptides and peptides derived from aberrantly translated genes, 7 of which were shared between four or two different cell lines. Overall, the high throughput identification of MHC class I-loaded peptides is an effective strategy for systematic characterization of cancer peptides, and could be employed for design of multi-peptide anticancer vaccines. SIGNIFICANCE: By employing proteomic analyses of eluted peptides from breast cancer cells, the current study has built an initial HLA-I-typed antigen collection for breast cancer research. It was also determined that immunogenic epitopes can be identified using established cell lines and that shared immunogenic peptides can be found in different cancer types such as breast cancer and leukemia. Importantly, out of 3196 eluted peptides that included duplicate peptides in different cells 89 peptides either contained mutation in their sequence or were derived from aberrant translation suggesting that mutation-containing epitopes are on the order of 2-3% in breast cancer cells. Finally, our results suggest that interfering with MHC class I function is one of the mechanisms of how tumor cells escape immune system attack.","['Rozanov, Dmitri V', 'Rozanov, Nikita D', 'Chiotti, Kami E', 'Reddy, Ashok', 'Wilmarth, Phillip A', 'David, Larry L', 'Cha, Seung W', 'Woo, Sunghee', 'Pevzner, Pavel', 'Bafna, Vineet', 'Burrows, Gregory G', 'Rantala, Juha K', 'Levin, Trevor', 'Anur, Pavana', 'Johnson-Camacho, Katie', 'Tabatabaei, Shaadi', 'Munson, Daniel J', 'Bruno, Tullia C', 'Slansky, Jill E', 'Kappler, John W', 'Hirano, Naoto', 'Boegel, Sebastian', 'Fox, Bernard A', 'Egelston, Colt', 'Simons, Diana L', 'Jimenez, Grecia', 'Lee, Peter P', 'Gray, Joe W', 'Spellman, Paul T']","['Rozanov DV', 'Rozanov ND', 'Chiotti KE', 'Reddy A', 'Wilmarth PA', 'David LL', 'Cha SW', 'Woo S', 'Pevzner P', 'Bafna V', 'Burrows GG', 'Rantala JK', 'Levin T', 'Anur P', 'Johnson-Camacho K', 'Tabatabaei S', 'Munson DJ', 'Bruno TC', 'Slansky JE', 'Kappler JW', 'Hirano N', 'Boegel S', 'Fox BA', 'Egelston C', 'Simons DL', 'Jimenez G', 'Lee PP', 'Gray JW', 'Spellman PT']","['Department of Molecular and Medical Genetics, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, OR, United States.

PPARgamma and its ligands contribute to various types of diseases including cancer. Given that currently developed therapies against leukemia are not very effective or safe, PPARgamma ligands have been shown to be a new class of compounds with the potential to treat hematologic malignancies, particularly leukemia. The capability of PPARgamma ligands to induce apoptosis, inhibit proliferation, and promote differentiation of leukemia cells suggests it has significant potential as a drug against leukemia. However, the specific mechanisms and molecules involved are not well-understood, although a number of PPARgamma ligands with anti-leukemic effects have been identified. This may explain why PPARgamma ligands have not been widely evaluated in clinical trials. To fill the gaps in the lack of understanding of specific anti-leukemic processes of PPARgamma ligands and further adapt these molecules as anti-leukemic agents, this review describes previous studies of the anti-leukemic effects of PPARgamma ligands.","['Ryu, Somi', 'Kim, Dae Seong', 'Lee, Myoung Woo', 'Lee, Ji Won', 'Sung, Ki Woong', 'Koo, Hong Hoe', 'Yoo, Keon Hee']","['Ryu S', 'Kim DS', 'Lee MW', 'Lee JW', 'Sung KW', 'Koo HH', 'Yoo KH']","['Gyeongsang National University Hospital, Gyeongsang National University School of Medicine, Jinju, South Korea.

A first routine measure to narrow down diagnosis in clinical practice is the differential blood count, determining the frequency of all major blood cells. What is lacking to advance initial blood diagnostics is an unbiased and quick functional assessment of blood that can narrow down the diagnosis and generate specific hypotheses. To address this need, we introduce the continuous, cell-by-cell morpho-rheological (MORE) analysis of diluted whole blood, without labeling, enrichment or separation, at rates of 1000 cells/sec. In a drop of blood we can identify all major blood cells and characterize their pathological changes in several disease conditions in vitro and in patient samples. This approach takes previous results of mechanical studies on specifically isolated blood cells to the level of application directly in blood and adds a functional dimension to conventional blood analysis.","['Toepfner, Nicole', 'Herold, Christoph', 'Otto, Oliver', 'Rosendahl, Philipp', 'Jacobi, Angela', 'Krater, Martin', 'Stachele, Julia', 'Menschner, Leonhard', 'Herbig, Maik', 'Ciuffreda, Laura', 'Ranford-Cartwright, Lisa', 'Grzybek, Michal', 'Coskun, Unal', 'Reithuber, Elisabeth', 'Garriss, Genevieve', 'Mellroth, Peter', 'Henriques-Normark, Birgitta', 'Tregay, Nicola', 'Suttorp, Meinolf', 'Bornhauser, Martin', 'Chilvers, Edwin R', 'Berner, Reinhard', 'Guck, Jochen']","['Toepfner N', 'Herold C', 'Otto O', 'Rosendahl P', 'Jacobi A', 'Krater M', 'Stachele J', 'Menschner L', 'Herbig M', 'Ciuffreda L', 'Ranford-Cartwright L', 'Grzybek M', 'Coskun U', 'Reithuber E', 'Garriss G', 'Mellroth P', 'Henriques-Normark B', 'Tregay N', 'Suttorp M', 'Bornhauser M', 'Chilvers ER', 'Berner R', 'Guck J']","['Center of Molecular and Cellular Bioengineering, Biotechnology Center, Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University Clinic Carl Gustav Carus, Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Center of Molecular and Cellular Bioengineering, Biotechnology Center, Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Zellmechanik Dresden GmbH, Dresden, Germany.', 'Center of Molecular and Cellular Bioengineering, Biotechnology Center, Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Zellmechanik Dresden GmbH, Dresden, Germany.', 'ZIK HIKE, Universitat Greifswald, Greifswald, Germany.', 'Center of Molecular and Cellular Bioengineering, Biotechnology Center, Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Zellmechanik Dresden GmbH, Dresden, Germany.', 'Center of Molecular and Cellular Bioengineering, Biotechnology Center, Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Clinic Carl Gustav Carus, Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University Clinic Carl Gustav Carus, Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University Clinic Carl Gustav Carus, Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Center of Molecular and Cellular Bioengineering, Biotechnology Center, Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Institute of Infection, Immunity and Inflammation, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom.', 'Institute of Infection, Immunity and Inflammation, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom.', 'Paul Langerhans Institute Dresden of the Helmholtz Centre Munich, University Hospital and Faculty of Medicine Carl Gustav Carus, Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'German Center for Diabetes Research, Neuherberg, Germany.', 'Paul Langerhans Institute Dresden of the Helmholtz Centre Munich, University Hospital and Faculty of Medicine Carl Gustav Carus, Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'German Center for Diabetes Research, Neuherberg, Germany.', 'Department of Microbiology, Tumor and Cell Biology, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical Microbiology, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Microbiology, Tumor and Cell Biology, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical Microbiology, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Microbiology, Tumor and Cell Biology, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical Microbiology, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Microbiology, Tumor and Cell Biology, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical Microbiology, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University Clinic Carl Gustav Carus, Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Clinic Carl Gustav Carus, Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University Clinic Carl Gustav Carus, Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Center of Molecular and Cellular Bioengineering, Biotechnology Center, Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Germany.']",['eng'],"['TRR83 and SFB655/Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft/International', 'Cambridge Biomedical Research Centre/National Institute for Health', 'Research/International', 'Non-commercial grant/Sonnenstrahl e.V.

They are characterized by inefficient hematopoiesis leading to peripheral cytopenia of one or more lineages and a variable risk of transformation into acute myeloid leukemia. They may either arise de novo as well as following exposition to environmental toxins, previous radiotherapy or chemotherapy or in the context of autoinflammatory diseases and related therapy. Characteristic cytogenetic abnormalities, along with the numbers of hematopoietic lineages affected and bone marrow blasts, enable an assessment of the risk of leukemic transformation. Acute leukemias are characterized by an accumulation of immature myeloid or lymphatic progenitor cells with limited differentiation capacity in the bone marrow. Proliferation of blast cells leads to suppression of normal hematopoiesis resulting in peripheral pancytopenia or leukocytosis associated with anemia and thrombocytopenia. Acute leukemias following MDS are defined as high-risk diseases. Intensive induction therapy followed by allogeneic stem cell transplantation is currently regarded as the only potentially curative treatment strategy. In this article the basic aspects of current diagnostics and treatment strategies for MDS and acute leukemia are outlined. Because of similarities with rheumatic inflammatory diseases, manifestations and treatment of graft versus host disease (GvHD) are also included.","['Schmalzing, M', 'Aringer, M', 'Bornhauser, M', 'Atta, J']","['Schmalzing M', 'Aringer M', 'Bornhauser M', 'Atta J']","['Medizinische Klinik & Poliklinik II, Universitatsklinikum Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Deutschland.', 'Medizinische Klinik III, Universitatsklinikum Carl Gustav Carus, Dresden, Deutschland.', 'Medizinische Klinik I, Universitatsklinikum Carl Gustav Carus, Dresden, Deutschland.', 'Institut fur Bildgebende Diagnostik, Tumortherapie-Center, Strahlenberger Str. 110, Offenbach am Main, Deutschland. atta@tumortherapie-center.de.']",['ger'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Germany,Z Rheumatol,Zeitschrift fur Rheumatologie,0414162,,['NOTNLM'],"['Cytopenia', 'Differentiation disorder', 'Graft versus host disease', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Therapy']",2018/01/14 06:00,2019/09/07 06:00,['2018/01/14 06:00'],"['2018/01/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/01/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/07 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s00393-017-0369-2 [doi]', '10.1007/s00393-017-0369-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Z Rheumatol. 2017 Oct;76(Suppl 2):26-32. doi: 10.1007/s00393-017-0369-2.,20190905,Suppl 2,,IM,"['Bone Marrow', '*Graft vs Host Disease', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', '*Myelodysplastic Syndromes']",,,,,,,,,"Myelodysplastisches Syndrom, akute Leukamie und Stammzelltransplantation.",,,,,,,,,,,,

We also investigated the effects of additional genetic alterations on FLT3-ITD. The 5-year overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) rates among the 47 AML(FLT3-ITD) patients were 42.2 and 36.8%, respectively. The 5-year disease-free survival rate among 29 patients without induction failure was 58.4%. We defined the allelic ratio (AR) of FLT3-ITD to WT > 0.7 as high. Significant differences were found in OS (AR-high, 20% vs. AR-low, 66%, p < 0.001) and EFS (13 vs. 50%, p = 0.004). All five patients with concurrent NPM1 mutations survived, while seven of eight patients who expressed the NUP98-NSD1 chimera failed to achieve 1CR and died. Multivariate analysis revealed that AR > 0.7 and expression of the NUP98-NSD1 chimera strongly impacted OS and EFS.

More thorough elucidation of the pathobiology of these genetically unclassified ('B-other') cases may identify novel treatment options. We analyzed gene expression profiles of 572 pediatric BCP-ALL cases, representing all major ALL subtypes. High expression of STAP1, an adaptor protein downstream of the B-cell receptor (BCR), was identified in BCR-ABL1-like and non-BCR-ABL1-like B-other cases. Limma analysis revealed an association between high expression of STAP1 and BCR signaling genes. However, STAP1 expression and pre-BCR signaling were not causally related: cytoplasmic Igmu levels were not abnormal in cases with high levels of STAP1 and stimulation of pre-BCR signaling did not induce STAP1 expression. To elucidate the role of STAP1 in BCP-ALL survival, expression was silenced in two human BCP-ALL cell lines. Knockdown of STAP1 did not reduce the proliferation rate or viability of these cells, suggesting that STAP1 is not a likely candidate for precision medicines. Moreover, high expression of STAP1 was not predictive for an unfavorable prognosis of BCR-ABL1-like and non-BCR-ABL1-like B-other cases.

Clinical variables that gave a statistically significant contribution to their concordance were absolute neutrophil count, ongoing antimicrobial therapy, timing of test execution, and organ localization of infection. The large analysis highlights the potential of molecular-based assays directly performed on blood samples, especially if implementing the detection of antibiotic resistance genes, which was lacking in the used study.","['Greco, Raffaella', 'Barbanti, Maria Chiara', 'Mancini, Nicasio', 'Crucitti, Lara', 'Oltolini, Chiara', 'Forcina, Alessandra', 'Lorentino, Francesca', 'Vago, Luca', 'Messina, Carlo', 'Clerici, Daniela', 'Morelli, Mara', 'Giglio, Fabio', 'Lupo Stanghellini, Maria Teresa', 'Infurnari, Laura', 'Carrabba, Matteo G', 'Marktel, Sarah', 'Assanelli, Andrea', 'Scarpellini, Paolo', 'Bernardi, Massimo', 'Peccatori, Jacopo', 'Corti, Consuelo', 'Clementi, Massimo', 'Ciceri, Fabio']","['Greco R', 'Barbanti MC', 'Mancini N', 'Crucitti L', 'Oltolini C', 'Forcina A', 'Lorentino F', 'Vago L', 'Messina C', 'Clerici D', 'Morelli M', 'Giglio F', 'Lupo Stanghellini MT', 'Infurnari L', 'Carrabba MG', 'Marktel S', 'Assanelli A', 'Scarpellini P', 'Bernardi M', 'Peccatori J', 'Corti C', 'Clementi M', 'Ciceri F']","['Hematology and BMT Unit, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, via Olgettina 60, 20132, Milano, Italy.', 'Hematology and BMT Unit, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, via Olgettina 60, 20132, Milano, Italy.', 'Laboratory of Microbiology and Virology, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milano, Italy.', 'Hematology and BMT Unit, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, via Olgettina 60, 20132, Milano, Italy.', 'Universita degli Studi di Milano, Milano, MI, Italy.', 'Infectious Disease Unit, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milano, Italy.', 'Hematology and BMT Unit, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, via Olgettina 60, 20132, Milano, Italy.', 'Hematology and BMT Unit, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, via Olgettina 60, 20132, Milano, Italy.', 'Hematology and BMT Unit, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, via Olgettina 60, 20132, Milano, Italy.', 'Unit of Immunogenetics, Leukemia Genomics and Immunobiology IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milano, Italy.', 'Hematology and BMT Unit, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, via Olgettina 60, 20132, Milano, Italy.', 'Hematology and BMT Unit, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, via Olgettina 60, 20132, Milano, Italy.', 'Hematology and BMT Unit, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, via Olgettina 60, 20132, Milano, Italy.', 'Hematology and BMT Unit, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, via Olgettina 60, 20132, Milano, Italy.', 'Hematology and BMT Unit, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, via Olgettina 60, 20132, Milano, Italy.', 'Laboratory of Microbiology and Virology, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milano, Italy.', 'Hematology and BMT Unit, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, via Olgettina 60, 20132, Milano, Italy.', 'Hematology and BMT Unit, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, via Olgettina 60, 20132, Milano, Italy.', 'Hematology and BMT Unit, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, via Olgettina 60, 20132, Milano, Italy.', 'Unit of Immunogenetics, Leukemia Genomics and Immunobiology IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milano, Italy.', 'Hematology and BMT Unit, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, via Olgettina 60, 20132, Milano, Italy.', 'Hematology and BMT Unit, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, via Olgettina 60, 20132, Milano, Italy.', 'Hematology and BMT Unit, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, via Olgettina 60, 20132, Milano, Italy.', 'Laboratory of Microbiology and Virology, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milano, Italy.', 'University Vita-Salute, via Olgettina 48, 20132, Milano, Italy.', 'Hematology and BMT Unit, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, via Olgettina 60, 20132, Milano, Italy. ciceri.fabio@hsr.it.', 'University Vita-Salute, via Olgettina 48, 20132, Milano, Italy. ciceri.fabio@hsr.it.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180112,England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,,,,2018/01/14 06:00,2019/05/16 06:00,['2018/01/14 06:00'],"['2017/01/29 00:00 [received]', '2017/10/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/10/23 00:00 [revised]', '2018/01/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/16 06:00 [medline]', '2018/01/14 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41409-017-0039-7 [doi]', '10.1038/s41409-017-0039-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2018 Apr;53(4):410-416. doi: 10.1038/s41409-017-0039-7.

Comprehensive geriatric and quality of life (EORTC QLQ C-30) assessements (CGA/QOL) in addition to disease-specific data were obtained in 108 consecutive patients (>/=60 years) pre-HCT, at day +30, +100, and +180. Median follow-up of 106 patients alive at alloHCT was 43.5 months, median age 66 years (range 60-78). Eighty-six (81.2%) had advanced disease risk at HCT and 99 (91.7%) patients received reduced intensity conditioning (RIC). Median PFS was 13.4 months with 38.3% (95% CI: 28.6-47.4) alive and in remission at 2 years; median OS was 15.6 months with 43.9% (95% CI: 34.3-53.4) alive at 2 years. Prognostic factors for PFS were: age: HR 1.084 (95% CI: 1.032-1.137, p = 0.0011); HCT-CI: HR 1.13 (95% CI: 1.001-1.274, p = 0.048); for OS: age: HR 1.08 (95% CI: 1.031-1.139, p = 0.0017), Karnofsky Index: HR 0.97 (95% CI: 0.954-0.996, p = 0.02); EORTC QLQ C-30 fatigue: HR 1.09 (95% CI: 1.004-1.185, p = 0.039); Up-and-Go: HR 3.26 (95% CI: 1.001-10.6, p = 0.049).

Here we analyzed the impact of the donor CMV serological status on the outcome of 983 CMV seropositive (CMV+), acute leukemia patients receiving a first, non T-cell depleted haplo-HSCT registered in the EBMT database. The 1-year NRM was 21.3% (95% CI: 18.4-24.8) and 18.8% (95% CI: 13.8-25.5) in the CMV D+/R+ and D-/R+ pairs, respectively (p = 0.40). Similarly, 1-year OS was 55.1% (95% CI: 50.1-58.0) and 55.7% (95% CI: 48.0-62.8) in the same groups (p = 0.50). The other main outcomes were comparable. No difference in NRM nor OS was observed after stratification for the intensity of conditioning and multivariate anaysis confirmed the lack of significant association with NRM or OS. In conclusion, the choice of a CMV-seronegative donor did not impair early survival of CMV-seropositive patients with acute leukemia after a first, non T-cell depleted haploidentical HSCT and PT-Cy among this series of 983 consecutive patients. Future research may focus on the assessment of the hierarchy of all the donor variables.","['Cesaro, Simone', 'Crocchiolo, Roberto', 'Tridello, Gloria', 'Knelange, Nina', 'Van Lint, Maria Teresa', 'Koc, Yener', 'Ciceri, Fabio', 'Gulbas, Zafer', 'Tischer, Johanna', 'Afanasyev, Boris', 'Bruno, Benedetto', 'Castagna, Luca', 'Blaise, Didier', 'Mohty, Mohamad', 'Irrera, Giuseppe', 'Diez-Martin, J L', 'Pierelli, Luca', 'Pioltelli, Pietro', 'Arat, Mutlu', 'Delia, Mario', 'Fagioli, Franca', 'Ehninger, Gerhard', 'Aljurf, Mahmoud', 'Carella, Angelo Michele', 'Ozdogu, Hakan', 'Mikulska, Malgorzata', 'Ljungman, Per', 'Nagler, Arnon', 'Styczynski, Jan']","['Cesaro S', 'Crocchiolo R', 'Tridello G', 'Knelange N', 'Van Lint MT', 'Koc Y', 'Ciceri F', 'Gulbas Z', 'Tischer J', 'Afanasyev B', 'Bruno B', 'Castagna L', 'Blaise D', 'Mohty M', 'Irrera G', 'Diez-Martin JL', 'Pierelli L', 'Pioltelli P', 'Arat M', 'Delia M', 'Fagioli F', 'Ehninger G', 'Aljurf M', 'Carella AM', 'Ozdogu H', 'Mikulska M', 'Ljungman P', 'Nagler A', 'Styczynski J']","['Pediatric Hematology Oncology, Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Integrata, Verona, Italy.', 'ASST Bergamo Ovest, Treviglio, Italy. roberto.crocchiolo@gmail.com.', 'Pediatric Hematology Oncology, Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Integrata, Verona, Italy.', 'BMT Data Office, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Ospedale San Martino, Genova, Italy.', 'Medical Park Hospitals, Antalya, Turkey.', 'Ospedale S.Raffaele s.r.l., Milano, Italy.', 'Anadolu Medical Center Hospital, Kocaeli, Turkey.', 'Klinikum Grosshadern, Munich, Germany.', 'First State Pavlov Medical University of St., Petersburg, Russia.', 'A.O.U Citta della Salute e della Scienza, Turin, Italy.', 'Istituto Clinico Humanitas, Milano, Italy.', 'Institut Paoli Calmettes, Marseille, France.', 'Hospital Saint Antoine, Paris, France.', 'Azienda Ospedaliera Bianchi-Melacrino-Morelli di Reggio Calabria, Reggio Calabria, Italy.', 'Hospital Gregorio Maranon, Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria Gregorio Maranon, Universidad Complutense, Madrid, Spain.', 'Ospedale S.

Fourteen patients were included, eight of these patients were in first complete remission (CR1), one was in CR2, one had a partial response and four patients had refractory disease at transplantation. The median delivered average dose was 11.395 Gy (range 10.06-12.17). The median planning target volume D95 was 8.2 Gy (range 7.52-9.01). The median delivered dose to skeleton bone with active bone marrow sites was 12.685 Gy (range 11.12-13.52). The results of this trial suggest that using HT TBI confers satisfactory immunosuppression and excellent eradication of malignant cells in patients with high-risk ALL undergoing allo-HSCT, especially in those with refractory ALL. After a median follow-up of 14.6 months (range 4-28), four patients experienced non-relapse mortality, ten patients are alive in durable CR including remission of extramedullary leukemic infiltration.

However, its use is still controversial in matched sibling donor (MSD) Allo-HSCT, notably after reduced intensity conditioning (RIC). ATG dose may influence the outcome, explaining in part the discordant conclusions in MSD Allo-HSCT. We, therefore, analyzed the impact of ATG doses in patients with acute myeloid leukemia in first complete remission undergoing RIC Allo-HSCT from a MSD. We analyzed 234 patients from the EBMT registry and compared outcome according to given ATG dose (high dose: >/= 6 mg/kg, n = 39 or low dose: < 6 mg/kg, n = 195). No difference was found in the cumulative incidence of acute (grade 2-4: high dose vs. low dose: 21% vs. 13%, p = 0.334; adjusted hazard ratio (HR): 1.20, p = 0.712) and chronic GVHD (extensive: high dose vs. low dose: 19% vs. 18%, p = 0.897; adjusted HR: 1.01, p = 0.980). In contrast, high dose of ATG significantly increased the incidence of relapse (52% vs. 26%, p = 0.011; adjusted HR: 1.31, p = 0.001) leading to impaired outcome (HR progression-free survival (PFS): 1.23, p = 0.002; HR overall survival (OS): 1.17, p = 0.029; HR GVHD and relapse-free survival (GRFS): 1.20, p = 0.005). We conclude that an ATG dose <6 mg/kg is sufficient for GVHD prophylaxis, while higher doses impair disease control and outcome.","['Devillier, Raynier', 'Labopin, Myriam', 'Chevallier, Patrice', 'Ledoux, Marie-Pierre', 'Socie, Gerard', 'Huynh, Anne', 'Bourhis, Jean-Henri', 'Cahn, Jean-Yves', 'Roth-Guepin, Gabrielle', 'Mufti, Ghulam', 'Desmier, Deborah', 'Michallet, Mauricette', 'Fegueux, Nathalie', 'Ciceri, Fabio', 'Baron, Frederic', 'Blaise, Didier', 'Nagler, Arnon', 'Mohty, Mohamad']","['Devillier R', 'Labopin M', 'Chevallier P', 'Ledoux MP', 'Socie G', 'Huynh A', 'Bourhis JH', 'Cahn JY', 'Roth-Guepin G', 'Mufti G', 'Desmier D', 'Michallet M', 'Fegueux N', 'Ciceri F', 'Baron F', 'Blaise D', 'Nagler A', 'Mohty M']","['Department of Hematology, Institut Paoli Calmettes, Marseille, France.', 'CRCM and Aix Marseille University, Marseille, France.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital Saint Antoine, APHP, Paris, France.', 'EBMT ALWP Office, Pierre and Marie Curie University, Paris, France.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital Nantes, Nantes, France.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital Hautepierre, Strasbourg, France.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hopital St Louis, APHP, Paris, France.', 'Department of Hematology, University Insitute of cancer of Toulouse-Oncopole, Toulouse, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Institut Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital A.

An adapted version of the assay was used to obtain error rates of RNA-dependent DNA synthesis for several RTs, including wild-type HIV-1BH10, HIV-1ESP49, AMV and MLV RTs, and the high-fidelity mutants of HIV-1ESP49 RT K65R and K65R/V75I. Our results showed that there were less than two-fold differences in fidelity between the studied RTs with error rates ranging within 2.5 x 10(-5) and 3.5 x 10(-5). These results were consistent with the existence of a transcriptional inaccuracy threshold, generated by the RNA polymerase while synthesizing the RNA template used in the assay. A modest but consistent reduction of the inaccuracy threshold was achieved by lowering the pH and Mg(2+) concentration of the transcription reaction. Despite assay limitations, we conclude that HIV-1BH10 and HIV-1ESP49 RTs are less accurate when copying DNA templates than RNA templates. Analysis of the RNA-dependent mutational spectra revealed a higher tendency to introduce large deletions at the initiation of reverse transcription by all HIV-1 RTs except the double-mutant K65R/V75I.","['Sebastian-Martin, Alba', 'Barrioluengo, Veronica', 'Menendez-Arias, Luis']","['Sebastian-Martin A', 'Barrioluengo V', 'Menendez-Arias L']","['Centro de Biologia Molecular ""Severo Ochoa"" (Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas & Universidad Autonoma de Madrid), c/Nicolas Cabrera, 1, Campus de Cantoblanco, 28049, Madrid, Spain.', 'Centro de Biologia Molecular ""Severo Ochoa"" (Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas & Universidad Autonoma de Madrid), c/Nicolas Cabrera, 1, Campus de Cantoblanco, 28049, Madrid, Spain.', 'DiaSorin Iberia S.A., Avenida de la Vega 1, 28108, Alcobendas (Madrid), Spain.', 'Centro de Biologia Molecular ""Severo Ochoa"" (Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas & Universidad Autonoma de Madrid), c/Nicolas Cabrera, 1, Campus de Cantoblanco, 28049, Madrid, Spain. lmenendez@cbm.csic.es.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180112,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,PMC5766491,,,2018/01/14 06:00,2018/12/18 06:00,['2018/01/14 06:00'],"['2017/10/03 00:00 [received]', '2017/12/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/01/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/12/18 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-017-18974-8 [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-017-18974-8 [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2018 Jan 12;8(1):627. doi: 10.1038/s41598-017-18974-8.,20181217,1,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",IM,"['DNA, Viral/*biosynthesis', 'HIV-1/enzymology/genetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/enzymology/genetics', 'Mutation', 'RNA, Viral/genetics', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/genetics/*metabolism', 'Retroviridae/*enzymology/genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Viral Proteins/genetics/metabolism']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7354-8964', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1251-6640']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Intergenically spliced chimeric RNAs (ISC) are transcribed in the absence of structural genomic changes, and aberrant ISC expression is now recognized as a potential driver of cancer. To better understand these potential oncogenic drivers, high-throughput RNA sequencing was performed on T-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) patient specimens (n = 24), and candidate T-ALL-related ISCs were identified (n = 55; a median of 4/patient). In-depth characterization of the NFATC3-PLA2G15 chimera, which was variably expressed in primary T-ALL, was performed. Functional assessment revealed that the fusion had lower activity than wild-type NFATC3 in vitro, and T-ALLs with elevated NFATC3-PLA2G15 levels had reduced transcription of canonical NFAT pathway genes in vivo Strikingly, high expression of the NFATC3-PLA2G15 chimera correlated with aggressive disease biology in murine patient-derived T-ALL xenografts, and poor prognosis in human T-ALL patients.

Mutation patterns were correlated with clinical parameters.Results: Evolutionary patterns correlated with clinical outcome. Gain of mutations was associated with late relapse. Alterations of epigenetic regulators were frequently gained at relapse with recurring alterations of KDM6A constituting a mechanism of cytarabine resistance. Low KDM6A expression correlated with adverse clinical outcome, particularly in male patients. At complete remission, persistent mutations representing preleukemic lesions were observed in 48% of patients. The persistence of DNMT3A mutations correlated with shorter time to relapse.Conclusions: Chemotherapy resistance might be acquired through gain of mutations. Insights into the evolution during therapy and disease progression lay the foundation for tailored approaches to treat or prevent relapse of CN-AML. Clin Cancer Res; 24(7); 1716-26.

In this study, we employed a genetically deficient mouse model to explore the role of the methylated DNA binding protein MBD2 in normal and malignant hematopoiesis. MBD2 ablation led to diminished lymphocytes. Functional defects of the lymphoid compartment were also observed after in vivo reconstitution of MBD2-deficient hematopoietic stem cells (HSC). In an established model of Notch1-driven T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), MBD2 ablation impeded malignant progression and maintenance by attenuating the Wnt signaling pathway. In clinical specimens of human T-ALL, Wnt signaling pathway signatures were significantly enhanced and positively correlated with the expression and function of MBD2. Furthermore, a number of typical Wnt signaling inhibitory genes were abnormally hypermethylated in primary human T-ALL. Abnormal activation of Wnt signaling in T-ALL was switched off by MBD2 deletion, partially by reactivating epigenetically silenced Wnt signaling inhibitors. Taken together, our results define essential roles for MBD2 in lymphopoiesis and T-ALL and suggest MBD2 as a candidate therapeutic target in T-ALL.Significance: This study highlights a methylated DNA binding protein as a candidate therapeutic target to improve the treatment of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias, as a new starting point for developing epigenetic therapy in this and other lymphoid malignancies.

Thus, novel pathogenic mechanisms and therapeutic targets need to be explored. Histone methylation is one of the most significant chromatin post-translational modifications. Here, we show that the histone demethylase PHF8 is highly expressed in a large number of ALL clinical specimens and that PHF8 expression is associated with ALL progression. PHF8 knockdown inhibits proliferation and promotes the apoptosis of ALL cells in vitro as well as attenuates tumor growth in vivo. PHF8 transcriptionally upregulates MEK1, a key molecule in the MEK/ERK pathway, at least partially by directly binding to its promoter, thereby activating the MEK/ERK pathway. In addition, we found that an inhibitor of the MEK/ERK pathway, PD184352, subsequently suppresses PHF8 expression. Thus, PHF8 forms a positive feedback loop with the MEK/ERK pathway, and PHF8 knockdown enhances the lethality of PD184352 in ALL cells. In conclusion, this study identifies oncogenic functions of PHF8 in adult ALL and suggests a novel epigenetic strategy for disease intervention.","['Fu, Yue', 'Yang, Yaling', 'Wang, Xiaoming', 'Yin, Xiaolin', 'Zhou, Minran', 'Wang, Siqi', 'Yang, Lin', 'Huang, Tao', 'Xu, Man', 'Chen, Chunyan']","['Fu Y', 'Yang Y', 'Wang X', 'Yin X', 'Zhou M', 'Wang S', 'Yang L', 'Huang T', 'Xu M', 'Chen C']","['Department of Hematology, Qilu Hospital, Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, PR China.

It is rarely a localized infection. Breast contamination has rarely been reported in lactating women. We report a breast abscess in man. CASE REPORT: A 80 year old man, hypertensive and arrhythmic, was explored for weakness and dehydration. Type 2 diabetes and chronic lymphocytic leukemia were diagnosed. Clinical examination disclosed a breast abcess related to L monocytogenes infection. Histopathological study also revealed a breast subcutaneous infiltration by chronic lymphocytic leukemia. CONCLUSION: Listeriosis sometimes uncover an unknown immunosuppression, especially in the elderly. Breast is a non-sterile tissue containing a stable microbiome partly from digestive origin. It can thereby be contaminated by Listeria. The specific cutaneous infiltrate of chronic lymphocytic leukemia can create the conditions for a local infection.","['Marsaudon, E', 'Berthy, J', 'Mamoune, S', 'Deniel, A', 'Ksiyer, S', 'Tiuca, D']","['Marsaudon E', 'Berthy J', 'Mamoune S', 'Deniel A', 'Ksiyer S', 'Tiuca D']","['Service de medecine interne, centre hospitalier Broceliande-Atlantique, site de Ploermel, 7, rue du roi Arthur, 56800 Ploermel, France.

This study aimed to assess the effects of crocin on the proliferation and function of T cells isolated from children with ALL. METHODS: The mononuclear cells were isolated from peripheral blood of children with ALL and then treated with different final concentrations of crocin. The levels of different cytokines secreted by T cells and the ratio of CD4 and CD8 were measured. Tail DNA% (TDNA), Tail moment (TM), Tail length (TL) and sister chromatid exchange (SCE) were detected to assess DNA damage of T cells. RESULTS: Crocin significantly promoted T cell proliferation and the secretion of IL-2 and IL-4 in a concentration dependent manner. In addition, crocin increased CD4/CD8 ratio of T subset. Crocin itself caused no significant damage to T cells but reduced DNA damage in T cells treated with Ara-C. CONCLUSIONS: Crocin could improve the proliferation and cytotoxic function of T cells, and reduce DNA damage caused by Ara-C.","['Zhang, Kunpeng', 'Wang, Lingzhen', 'Si, Shaoyong', 'Sun, Yan', 'Pei, Wenting', 'Ming, Yan', 'Sun, Lirong']","['Zhang K', 'Wang L', 'Si S', 'Sun Y', 'Pei W', 'Ming Y', 'Sun L']","['Department of Pediatrics Hematology, The Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University, No. 16 Jiangsu Road, Qingdao, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics Hematology, The Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University, No. 16 Jiangsu Road, Qingdao, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics Hematology, The Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University, No. 16 Jiangsu Road, Qingdao, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics Hematology, The Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University, No. 16 Jiangsu Road, Qingdao, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics Hematology, The Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University, No. 16 Jiangsu Road, Qingdao, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics Hematology, The Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University, No. 16 Jiangsu Road, Qingdao, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics Hematology, The Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University, No. 16 Jiangsu Road, Qingdao, China.

It was previously reported that SSL5 bound to P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1) and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9, leading to inhibition of leukocyte adhesion and invasion. These interactions were suggested to depend on sialic acid-containing glycans of MMP-9, but the roles of sialic acids in the interaction between SSL5 and MMP-9 are still controversial. In the present study, we prepared recombinant glutathione S-transferase-tagged SSL5 (GST-SSL5) and analyzed its binding capacity to MMP-9 by pull-down assay after various modifications of its carbohydrate moieties. We observed that GST-SSL5 specifically bound to MMP-9 from a human monocytic leukemia cell line (THP-1 cells) and inhibited its enzymatic activity in a concentration-dependent manner. After MMP-9 was treated with neuraminidase, its binding activity towards GST-SSL5 was markedly decreased. Furthermore, recombinant MMP-9 produced by sialic acid-deficient Lec2 mutant cells showed much lower affinity for SSL5 than that produced by wild-type CHO-K1 cells. Treatment of MMP-9 with PNGase F to remove N-glycan resulted in no significant change in the GST-SSL5/MMP-9 interaction. In contrast, the binding of GST-SSL5 to MMP-9 secreted from THP-1 cells cultured in the presence of an inhibitor for the biosynthesis of O-glycan (benzyl-GalNAc) was weaker than the binding of GST-SSL5 to MMP-9 secreted from untreated cells. These results strongly suggest the importance of the sialic acid-containing O-glycans of MMP-9 for the interaction of MMP-9 with GST-SSL5.","['Kurisaka, Chisato', 'Oku, Teruaki', 'Itoh, Saotomo', 'Tsuji, Tsutomu']","['Kurisaka C', 'Oku T', 'Itoh S', 'Tsuji T']","['Department of Microbiology, Hoshi University School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, 2-4-41 Ebara, Shinagawa-ku, Tokyo 142-8501, Japan.', 'Department of Microbiology, Hoshi University School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, 2-4-41 Ebara, Shinagawa-ku, Tokyo 142-8501, Japan.', 'Department of Microbiology, Hoshi University School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, 2-4-41 Ebara, Shinagawa-ku, Tokyo 142-8501, Japan.', 'Department of Microbiology, Hoshi University School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, 2-4-41 Ebara, Shinagawa-ku, Tokyo 142-8501, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20180214,Australia,Microbiol Immunol,Microbiology and immunology,7703966,,['NOTNLM'],"['immune evasion', 'matrix metalloproteinase', 'sialic acid', 'staphylococcal superantigen-like protein']",2018/01/13 06:00,2018/08/21 06:00,['2018/01/13 06:00'],"['2017/08/27 00:00 [received]', '2017/12/16 00:00 [revised]', '2018/01/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/08/21 06:00 [medline]', '2018/01/13 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/1348-0421.12573 [doi]'],ppublish,Microbiol Immunol. 2018 Mar;62(3):168-175. doi: 10.1111/1348-0421.12573.

To determine the underlying mechanisms of ES progression, cross analysis was conducted on three highthroughput genome or transcript me datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus. The results indicated that CPX may inhibit ES growth by affecting vasculature development and DNA replication. A combination of genomewide expression and binding profiles revealed several potential targets for CPX in ES, including collagen type I alpha2 chain, Nmyc protooncogene and transforming growth factor beta1, which contained significantly enriched binding peaks of FLI1. In addition, network analysis, including a proteinprotein interaction network and a transcription regulatory network, provided further detailed information about the roles of CPX in ES.

ICT1-deficiency has been recognized as a cell growth inhibitor of hepatoblastoma and glioblastoma multiforme. To explore the role of ICT1 in human leukemia, 2 short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) targeting ICT1 sequences were designed in leukemia U937 cells. The successful infection of ICT1 in the U937 cells was observed under a fluorescence microscope and further quantified by western blotting and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis. Tetrazolium dye (MTT) assay revealed a significant decrease in proliferation of ICT1-knockdown U937 cells on the fourth and fifth day as compared with the control. Depletion of ICT1 resulted in an increase in S phase and sub-G1 (representing cell apoptosis) fractions. Annexin V-APC/7-AAD staining assay confirmed that knockdown of ICT1 played a crucial role in boosting early and late apoptotic programs in U937 cells. Downregulation of ICT1 also altered cyclin A2 transcription expression, caspase-3 activity and p21 protein expression. Additionally, decreased levels of heat shock protein 27 (HSP27) phosphorylation at Ser78 was correlated with knockdown of ICT1 in U937 cells. Thus, we concluded that the regulatory role of ICT1 in leukemia may be used as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of leukemia.","['Li, Guang-Yao', 'Liu, Ji-Zhu', 'Zhang, Li', 'Liu, Guo-Zhen', 'Li, Shuang-Jing', 'Xiao, Tai-Wu', 'Wang, Jing-Xia', 'Wang, Le-Xin', 'Hou, Ming']","['Li GY', 'Liu JZ', 'Zhang L', 'Liu GZ', 'Li SJ', 'Xiao TW', 'Wang JX', 'Wang LX', 'Hou M']","['Department of Hematology, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong 250012, P.R.

We investigated the mechanisms involved in mediating the effects of Rhus verniciflua Strokes (R. verniciflua) extract in human chronic myelogenous leukemia K562 cells, including caspase-dependent apoptotic pathways related to cell-cycle arrest, as well as the inhibition of nuclear factor NF-kappaB activation and upregulation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway. R. verniciflua extract suppressed the abnormal cellular proliferation of K562 cells in a dose- and timedependent manner and increased the quantitative proportions of cells involved in the early and late process of apoptosis. Furthermore, R. verniciflua extract significantly mediated the mRNA levels of pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic regulators, such as Bcl-2, Bax, Mcl-1 and survivin in apoptotic cells. Particularly, the treatment of K562 cells with R. verniciflua extract augmented the caspase3 activity and increased the expression of caspase3 protein, while co-treatment with R. verniciflua extract and the permeant pancaspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK and caspase3 inhibitor Z-DEVD-FMK inversely enhanced the proliferation of K562 cells. The extract of R. verniciflua inhibited the activation of NF-kappaB and the phosphorylation of ERK. Collectively, these results indicated that the extract of R. verniciflua inhibited the proliferation of human chronic myelogenous leukemia K562 cells by activating the apoptotic process via caspase3 overexpression and the regulation of the NF-kappaB and MAPK signaling.","['Lee, Kyung-Wook', 'Um, Eun-Sik', 'Jung, Bo-Bae', 'Choi, Eun-Sol', 'Kim, Eun-Young', 'Lee, Seungbo', 'Jang, Eungyeong', 'Lee, Jang-Hoon', 'Kim, Youngchul']","['Lee KW', 'Um ES', 'Jung BB', 'Choi ES', 'Kim EY', 'Lee S', 'Jang E', 'Lee JH', 'Kim Y']","['Department of Clinical Korean Medicine, Graduate School, Kyung Hee University, Seoul 02447, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Clinical Korean Medicine, Graduate School, Kyung Hee University, Seoul 02447, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Clinical Korean Medicine, Graduate School, Kyung Hee University, Seoul 02447, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Clinical Korean Medicine, Graduate School, Kyung Hee University, Seoul 02447, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Clinical Korean Medicine, Graduate School, Kyung Hee University, Seoul 02447, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Clinical Korean Medicine, Graduate School, Kyung Hee University, Seoul 02447, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Clinical Korean Medicine, Graduate School, Kyung Hee University, Seoul 02447, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Clinical Korean Medicine, Graduate School, Kyung Hee University, Seoul 02447, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Clinical Korean Medicine, Graduate School, Kyung Hee University, Seoul 02447, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20180103,Greece,Oncol Rep,Oncology reports,9422756,,,,2018/01/13 06:00,2018/08/31 06:00,['2018/01/13 06:00'],"['2017/05/16 00:00 [received]', '2017/12/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/08/31 06:00 [medline]', '2018/01/13 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.3892/or.2018.6179 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncol Rep. 2018 Mar;39(3):1141-1147. doi: 10.3892/or.2018.6179.

Delivery of BL via nanoliposomes has been shown to improve its oral bioavailability and longcirculating property in vivo. However, the role of BL in the inhibition of human chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) K562 cell growth and its underlying mechanisms has yet to be elucidated. In the present study, BL was formulated into liposomes with different sizes to improve its solubility and stability. The cytotoxic and proapoptotic effects of free BL and liposomal BL were also evaluated. The results demonstrated that 100 nm liposomes were the most stable formulation when compared with 200 and 400 nm liposomes. Liposomal BL inhibited K562 cell growth as efficiently as free BL (prepared in DMSO), indicating that the liposome may be a potential vehicle to deliver BL for the treatment of CML. Flow cytometry analysis showed that there was significant (P<0.005) cell cycle arrest in the subG1 phase (compared with vehicle control), indicating cell apoptosis following 20 microM liposomal BL or free BL treatment of K562 cells for 48 h. The induction of cell apoptosis by all BL preparations was further confirmed through the staining of treated cells with Annexin Vfluorescein isothiocyanate/propidium iodide. A significant increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) gene-ration was observed in free BL and liposomal BL treated cells, with a higher level of ROS produced from those treated with free BL. This indicated that cell apoptosis induced by BL may be via ROS generation and liposome delivery may further extend the effect through its longcirculating property.","['Wang, Scarlet Xiaoyan', 'Wen, Xuesong', 'Bell, Celia', 'Appiah, Sandra']","['Wang SX', 'Wen X', 'Bell C', 'Appiah S']","['Department of Natural Sciences, Faculty of Science and Technology, Middlesex University, London NW4 4BT, UK.', 'Department of Natural Sciences, Faculty of Science and Technology, Middlesex University, London NW4 4BT, UK.', 'Department of Natural Sciences, Faculty of Science and Technology, Middlesex University, London NW4 4BT, UK.', 'Department of Natural Sciences, Faculty of Science and Technology, Middlesex University, London NW4 4BT, UK.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20180108,Greece,Mol Med Rep,Molecular medicine reports,101475259,PMC5802230,['NOTNLM'],"['*baicalein', '*liposomes', '*chronic myeloid leukemia', '*cell cycle', '*apoptosis', '*reactive oxygen species']",2018/01/13 06:00,2018/08/15 06:00,['2018/01/13 06:00'],"['2017/09/11 00:00 [received]', '2017/12/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/08/15 06:00 [medline]', '2018/01/13 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.3892/mmr.2018.8396 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Med Rep. 2018 Mar;17(3):4524-4530. doi: 10.3892/mmr.2018.8396.

Recent technological advances have led to an improved understanding of AML biology but also uncovered the enormous cytogenetic and molecular heterogeneity of the disease. Despite this heterogeneity, AML is mostly managed by a 'one-size-fits-all' approach consisting of intensive, highly toxic induction and consolidation chemotherapy. These treatment protocols have remained largely unchanged for the past several decades and only lead to a cure in approximately 30-35% of cases. The advent of targeted therapies in chronic myeloid leukaemia and other malignancies has sparked hope to improve patient outcome in AML. However, the implementation of targeted agents in AML therapy has been unexpectedly cumbersome and remains a difficult task due to a variety of disease- and patient-specific factors. In this review, we describe current standard and investigational therapeutic strategies with a focus on targeted agents and highlight potential tools that might facilitate the development of targeted therapies for this fatal disease. The classes of agents described in this review include constitutively activated signalling pathway inhibitors, surface receptor targets, epigenetic modifiers, drugs targeting the interaction of the hematopoietic progenitor cell with the stroma and drugs that target the apoptotic machinery. The clinical context and outcome with these agents will be examined to gain insight about their optimal utilization.","['Brinda, Bryan', 'Khan, Irum', 'Parkin, Brian', 'Konig, Heiko']","['Brinda B', 'Khan I', 'Parkin B', 'Konig H']","['Indiana University Melvin and Bren Simon Cancer Center, Indianapolis, IN, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, College of Medicine at Chicago, University of Illinois, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.', 'Indiana University Melvin and Bren Simon Cancer Center, Indianapolis, IN, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20180112,England,J Cell Mol Med,Journal of cellular and molecular medicine,101083777,PMC5824388,['NOTNLM'],"['*acute myeloid leukaemia', '*drug resistance', '*minimal residual disease', '*targeted therapies']",2018/01/13 06:00,2019/10/11 06:00,['2018/01/13 06:00'],"['2017/05/31 00:00 [received]', '2017/10/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/11 06:00 [medline]', '2018/01/13 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/jcmm.13478 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Mol Med. 2018 Mar;22(3):1411-1427. doi: 10.1111/jcmm.13478.

The diagnosis of this rare entity is often challenging and the cytologic overlap with non-neoplastic (eg, megaloblastic anemia) and neoplastic entities (eg, other types of acute leukemia and non-hematopoietic malignancies) warrants a significant degree of clinical, laboratory, immunophenotypic, and genetic investigation. Given the limited number of reports of this rare and diagnostically challenging entity, we report detailed clinicopathologic characteristics from 15 patients, the largest series thus far, of primary de novo pure erythroid leukemia to provide further diagnostic insights into this entity and reveal strategies for making the diagnosis. We found that de novo pure erythroid leukemia is a disease of adults (median age 68 years), exhibits a striking male predominance, is universally associated with an abnormal karyotype and has an exceedingly poor overall median survival of 1.4 months. Given the general inability of immunophenotypic markers to discriminate neoplastic from non-neoplastic erythroid proliferations, key features identified in this study to help establish the diagnosis of pure erythroid leukemia and exclude mimickers include circulating pronormoblasts, clear-cut dysplasia in erythroid, granulocytic, and/or megakaryocytic lineage, utilization of a broad immunophenotypic panel, TP53 immunohistochemical positivity, and identification of a complex, often highly complex, karyotype. Given the gravity of a diagnosis of de novo pure erythroid leukemia, it should be rendered with utmost confidence.","['Reinig, Erica F', 'Greipp, Patricia T', 'Chiu, April', 'Howard, Matthew T', 'Reichard, Kaaren K']","['Reinig EF', 'Greipp PT', 'Chiu A', 'Howard MT', 'Reichard KK']","['Division of Hematopathology, Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Laboratory Genetics and Genomics, Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematopathology, Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematopathology, Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematopathology, Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20180112,United States,Mod Pathol,"Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc",8806605,,,,2018/01/13 06:00,2019/04/16 06:00,['2018/01/13 06:00'],"['2017/08/15 00:00 [received]', '2017/10/16 00:00 [revised]', '2017/10/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/16 06:00 [medline]', '2018/01/13 06:00 [entrez]']","['modpathol2017175 [pii]', '10.1038/modpathol.2017.175 [doi]']",ppublish,Mod Pathol. 2018 May;31(5):705-717. doi: 10.1038/modpathol.2017.175.

Classification of myeloproliferative neoplasms is based on hematologic, histopathologic and molecular characteristics including the presence of the BCR-ABL1 and JAK2 V617F. Although thought to be mutually exclusive, a number of cases with co-occurring BCR-ABL1 and JAK2 V617F have been identified. To characterize the clinicopathologic features of myeloproliferative neoplasms with concomitant BCR-ABL1 and JAK2 V617F, and define the frequency of co-occurrence, we conducted a retrospective multi-institutional study. Cases were identified using a search of electronic databases over a decade at six major institutions. Of 1570 patients who were tested for both BCR-ABL1 and JAK2 V617F, six were positive for both. An additional five patients were identified via clinical records providing a total of 11 cases for detailed evaluation. For each case, clinical variables, hematologic and genetic data, and bone marrow histomorphologic features were analyzed. The sequence of identification of the genetic abnormalities varied: five patients were initially diagnosed with a JAK2 V617F+ myeloproliferative neoplasm, one patient initially had BCR-ABL1+ chronic myeloid leukemia, while both alterations were identified simultaneously in five patients. Classification of the BCR-ABL1-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms varied, and in some cases, features only became apparent following tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy. Seven of the 11 patients showed myelofibrosis, in some cases before identification of the second genetic alteration. Our data, reflecting the largest reported study comprehensively detailing clinicopathologic features and response to therapy, show that the co-occurrence of BCR-ABL1 and JAK2 V617F is rare, with an estimated frequency of 0.4%, and most often reflects two distinct ('composite') myeloproliferative neoplasms. Although uncommon, it is important to be aware of this potentially confounding genetic combination, lest these features be misinterpreted to reflect resistance to therapy or disease progression, considerations that could lead to inappropriate management.","['Soderquist, Craig R', 'Ewalt, Mark D', 'Czuchlewski, David R', 'Geyer, Julia T', 'Rogers, Heesun J', 'Hsi, Eric D', 'Wang, Sa A', 'Bueso-Ramos, Carlos E', 'Orazi, Attilio', 'Arber, Daniel A', 'Hexner, Elizabeth O', 'Babushok, Daria V', 'Bagg, Adam']","['Soderquist CR', 'Ewalt MD', 'Czuchlewski DR', 'Geyer JT', 'Rogers HJ', 'Hsi ED', 'Wang SA', 'Bueso-Ramos CE', 'Orazi A', 'Arber DA', 'Hexner EO', 'Babushok DV', 'Bagg A']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Colorado, Denver, CO, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.']",['eng'],['K08 HL132101/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20180112,United States,Mod Pathol,"Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc",8806605,PMC6008160,,,2018/01/13 06:00,2019/04/16 06:00,['2018/01/13 06:00'],"['2017/06/01 00:00 [received]', '2017/10/22 00:00 [revised]', '2017/10/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/16 06:00 [medline]', '2018/01/13 06:00 [entrez]']","['modpathol2017182 [pii]', '10.1038/modpathol.2017.182 [doi]']",ppublish,Mod Pathol. 2018 May;31(5):690-704. doi: 10.1038/modpathol.2017.182.

The observations made by multiple published studies led to the conclusion that some of these small sequences could be eventually used as biomarkers for diagnosis/prognosis. This meta-analysis investigated whether microRNA-181 family members could predict the outcome of patients carrying different types of cancer. We searched the PubMed and Embase databases for studies evaluating the expression levels of miR-181a/b/c/d in patients with cancer, selecting the publications that assessed the relation between low and high levels of one of these four microRNAs and patients' outcome. Hazard ratios (HRs) or risk ratios (RRs) were extracted from the studies, and random-effect model was performed to investigate the role of miR-181 in the outcome of these patients. The meta-analysis comprised 26 studies including 2653 cancer patients from 6 countries. The results showed significant association between the expression of miR-181 family members and colorectal cancer.

In vivo, NPs enhance the therapeutic efficacy of anticancer agents when compared with conventional chemotherapy, improving vectorization and delivery, and helping to overcome drug resistance. Nanomedicine has been mostly focused on solid cancers due to take advantage from the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect experienced by tissues in the close vicinity of tumors, which enhance nanomedicine's accumulation and, consequently, improve efficacy. Nanomedicines for leukemia and lymphoma, where EPR effect is not a factor, are addressed differently from solid tumors. Nevertheless, NPs have provided innovative approaches to simple and non-invasive methodologies for diagnosis and treatment in liquid tumors. In this review, we consider the state of the art on different types of nanoconstructs for the management of liquid tumors, from preclinical studies to clinical trials.

Disease latency, mutational events and prognosis vary with drugs categories. Methods: We describe a cohort of 30 patients, 18 females and 12 males, with median age of 52.5 years (range, 20 to 64), submitted to allogeneic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in our department between September 1999 and March 2017. Patients had a history of solid tumour in 14 cases, haematological disease in 15 cases and both of them in one case. After a median of 36.5 months (range, 4 to 190) from first neoplasm, patients developed t-AML in 19 cases and t-MDS in 11 cases. Molecular abnormalities were detected in 5 patients, while karyotype aberrations were found in 17 patients. Patients received conventional chemotherapy in 14 cases, azacitidine in 10 cases and both of them in one case. Five patients were submitted to HSCT without previous treatment except for supportive therapy. Results: Seventeen patients obtained sustained CR after SCT, while 8 patients showed resistant or relapsed disease. The remaining five patients died early after SCT. At follow up time (May 2017) 13 patients were alive with a median OS of 48 months (range 3-195), while 17 patients died after a median of 4 months (range 1-27) by relapse mortality in 6 cases and non-relapse mortality in the other 11 patients.

Enhanced CXC chemokine receptor-4 (CXCR4) and chemokine receptor-7 (CCR7) recycling contributes to the elevated surface levels of these receptors on CLL cells. Here we have addressed the role of p66Shc, a member of the Shc family of protein adaptors the expression of which is defective in CLL cells, in CXCR4/CCR7 recycling. p66Shc reconstitution in CLL cells reduced CXCR4/CCR7 recycling, lowering their surface levels and attenuating B-cell chemotaxis, due to their accumulation in Rab5(+) endosomes as serine-phosphoproteins bound to beta-arrestin. This results from the ability of p66Shc to inhibit Ca(2+) and PP2B-dependent CXCR4/CCR7 dephosphorylation and beta-arrestin release. We also show that ibrutinib, a Btk inhibitor that promotes leukemic cell mobilization from lymphoid organs, reverses the CXCR4/CCR7 recycling abnormalities in CLL cells by increasing p66Shc expression. These results, identifying p66Shc as a regulator of CXCR4/CCR7 recycling in B cells, underscore the relevance of its deficiency to CLL pathogenesis and provide new clues to the mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects of ibrutinib.","['Patrussi, Laura', 'Capitani, Nagaja', 'Cattaneo, Francesca', 'Manganaro, Noemi', 'Gamberucci, Alessandra', 'Frezzato, Federica', 'Martini, Veronica', 'Visentin, Andrea', 'Pelicci, Pier Giuseppe', ""D'Elios, Mario M"", 'Trentin, Livio', 'Semenzato, Gianpietro', 'Baldari, Cosima T']","['Patrussi L', 'Capitani N', 'Cattaneo F', 'Manganaro N', 'Gamberucci A', 'Frezzato F', 'Martini V', 'Visentin A', 'Pelicci PG', ""D'Elios MM"", 'Trentin L', 'Semenzato G', 'Baldari CT']","['Department of Life Sciences, University of Siena, Siena, Italy. patrussi2@unisi.it.', 'Department of Life Sciences, University of Siena, Siena, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Florence, Florence, Italy.', 'Department of Life Sciences, University of Siena, Siena, Italy.', 'Department of Life Sciences, University of Siena, Siena, Italy.', 'Department of Molecular and Developmental Medicine, University of Siena, Siena, Italy.', 'Venetian Institute of Molecular Medicine, Padua, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology and Clinical Immunology Branch, Padua University School of Medicine, Padua, Italy.', 'Venetian Institute of Molecular Medicine, Padua, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology and Clinical Immunology Branch, Padua University School of Medicine, Padua, Italy.', 'Venetian Institute of Molecular Medicine, Padua, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology and Clinical Immunology Branch, Padua University School of Medicine, Padua, Italy.', 'European Institute of Oncology, Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Florence, Florence, Italy.', 'Venetian Institute of Molecular Medicine, Padua, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology and Clinical Immunology Branch, Padua University School of Medicine, Padua, Italy.', 'Venetian Institute of Molecular Medicine, Padua, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology and Clinical Immunology Branch, Padua University School of Medicine, Padua, Italy.', 'Department of Life Sciences, University of Siena, Siena, Italy. baldari@unisi.it.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180112,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,,,,2018/01/13 06:00,2019/03/22 06:00,['2018/01/13 06:00'],"['2017/04/28 00:00 [received]', '2017/11/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/10/06 00:00 [revised]', '2018/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/22 06:00 [medline]', '2018/01/13 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41388-017-0066-2 [doi]', '10.1038/s41388-017-0066-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2018 Mar;37(11):1534-1550. doi: 10.1038/s41388-017-0066-2.

Although microRNA (miR)-452 serves as a tumor suppressor in multiple solid tumors, its expression and function in hematological cancers including T-ALL is largely unknown. We measured the expression of miR-452 in 38 T-ALL and 22 normal lymph node samples by real-time PCR analysis. The methylation levels in the promoter of miR-452 were determined using MethyLight assay. The effects of miR-452 overexpression on proliferation, cell cycle distribution, and tumorigenesis were explored. It was found that miR-452 expression levels were significantly lower in T-ALL specimens than in normal lymph node biopsies (P=0.0079). T-ALL specimens had a significantly higher methylation level in the promoter of miR-452 than normal lymph node tissues (P=0.0014). Consistently, miR-452 was downregulated in Jurkat and Molt-4 T-ALL cells, whose expression was restored after treatment with a demethylation agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine. Ectopic expression of miR-452 inhibited the proliferation of Jurkat and Molt-4 cells and induced a G0/G1 cell cycle arrest. Overexpression of miR-452 suppressed the protein expression of BMI1 in T-ALL cells. Rescue experiments revealed that overexpression of BMI1 partially reversed the growth-suppressive effect of miR-452 on T-ALL cells. Xenograft tumor studies confirmed that overexpression of miR-452 suppressed tumor growth in nude mice and reduced the expression of BMI1. Collectively, miR-452 is epigenetically silenced and targets BMI1 to exert a growth suppressive activity in T-ALL. Restoration of miR-452 expression may represent a promising therapeutic strategy for this malignancy.","['Wang, Haihao', 'Guo, Qiannan', 'Zhu, Guizhi', 'Zhu, Shuo', 'Yang, Peiwen', 'Zhang, Mingsheng']","['Wang H', 'Guo Q', 'Zhu G', 'Zhu S', 'Yang P', 'Zhang M']","['Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Reproductive Medicine Center, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Oncology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20180110,England,J Investig Med,Journal of investigative medicine : the official publication of the American Federation for Clinical Research,9501229,,['NOTNLM'],['*cell cycle'],2018/01/13 06:00,2019/10/01 06:00,['2018/01/13 06:00'],"['2017/12/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/01 06:00 [medline]', '2018/01/13 06:00 [entrez]']","['jim-2017-000591 [pii]', '10.1136/jim-2017-000591 [doi]']",ppublish,J Investig Med. 2018 Apr;66(4):773-779. doi: 10.1136/jim-2017-000591.

However, the critical factors that are directly activated by TAL1 and contribute to T-ALL pathogenesis are largely unknown. Here, we identified AT-rich interactive domain 5B (ARID5B) as a collaborating oncogenic factor involved in the transcriptional program in T-ALL. ARID5B expression is down-regulated at the double-negative 2-4 stages in normal thymocytes, while it is induced by the TAL1 complex in human T-ALL cells. The enhancer located 135 kb upstream of the ARID5B gene locus is activated under a superenhancer in T-ALL cells but not in normal T cells. Notably, ARID5B-bound regions are associated predominantly with active transcription. ARID5B and TAL1 frequently co-occupy target genes and coordinately control their expression. ARID5B positively regulates the expression of TAL1 and its regulatory partners. ARID5B also activates the expression of the oncogene MYC Importantly, ARID5B is required for the survival and growth of T-ALL cells, and forced expression of ARID5B in immature thymocytes results in thymus retention, differentiation arrest, radioresistance, and tumor formation in zebrafish. Our results indicate that ARID5B reinforces the oncogenic transcriptional program by positively regulating the TAL1-induced regulatory circuit and MYC in T-ALL, thereby contributing to T-cell leukemogenesis.","['Leong, Wei Zhong', 'Tan, Shi Hao', 'Ngoc, Phuong Cao Thi', 'Amanda, Stella', 'Yam, Alice Wei Yee', 'Liau, Wei-Siang', 'Gong, Zhiyuan', 'Lawton, Lee N', 'Tenen, Daniel G', 'Sanda, Takaomi']","['Leong WZ', 'Tan SH', 'Ngoc PCT', 'Amanda S', 'Yam AWY', 'Liau WS', 'Gong Z', 'Lawton LN', 'Tenen DG', 'Sanda T']","['Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, 117599 Singapore.', 'Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, 117599 Singapore.', 'Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, 117599 Singapore.', 'Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, 117599 Singapore.', 'Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, 117599 Singapore.', 'Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, 117599 Singapore.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, National University of Singapore, 117543 Singapore.', 'Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, 117599 Singapore.', 'Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, 117599 Singapore.', 'Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02215, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, 117599 Singapore.', 'Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, 117599 Singapore.', 'Department of Medicine, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, 117599 Singapore.']",['eng'],"['K99 CA157951/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA066996/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 HL131477/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R35 CA197697/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180111,United States,Genes Dev,Genes & development,8711660,PMC5795782,['NOTNLM'],"['*ARID5B', '*MYC', '*T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*TAL1', '*core regulatory circuit']",2018/01/13 06:00,2018/02/09 06:00,['2018/01/13 06:00'],"['2017/05/29 00:00 [received]', '2017/11/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/09 06:00 [medline]', '2018/01/13 06:00 [entrez]']","['gad.302646.117 [pii]', '10.1101/gad.302646.117 [doi]']",ppublish,Genes Dev. 2017 Dec 1;31(23-24):2343-2360. doi: 10.1101/gad.302646.117.

Dnmt3a inactivation in hematopoietic stem cells has been shown to drive B cell-related malignancies, including chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and associates with specific DNA methylation patterns in transformed cells. However, while it is clear that inactivation of Dnmt3a in hematopoietic stem cells has profound functional effects, the consequences of Dnmt3a inactivation in cells of the B lineage are unclear. To assess whether loss of Dnmt3a at the earliest stages of B cell development lead to DNA methylation defects that might impair function, we selectively inactivated Dnmt3a early in mouse B cell development and then utilized whole genome bisulfite sequencing to generate base-resolution profiles of Dnmt3a(+/+) and Dnmt3a(-/-) naive splenic B cells. Overall, we find that global methylation patterns are largely consistent between Dnmt3a(+/+) and Dnmt3a(-/-) naive B cells, indicating a minimal functional effect of DNMT3A in mature B cells. However, loss of Dnmt3a induced 449 focal DNA methylation changes, dominated by loss-of-methylation events. Regions found to be hypomethylated in Dnmt3a(-/-) naive splenic B cells were enriched in gene bodies of transcripts expressed in B cells, a fraction of which are implicated in B cell-related disease. Overall, the results from this study suggest that factors other than Dnmt3a are the major drivers for methylome maintenance in B cell development.","['Duncan, Christopher G', 'Kondilis-Mangum, Hrisavgi D', 'Grimm, Sara A', 'Bushel, Pierre R', 'Chrysovergis, Kaliopi', 'Roberts, John D', 'Tyson, Frederick L', 'Merrick, B Alex', 'Wade, Paul A']","['Duncan CG', 'Kondilis-Mangum HD', 'Grimm SA', 'Bushel PR', 'Chrysovergis K', 'Roberts JD', 'Tyson FL', 'Merrick BA', 'Wade PA']","['Epigenetics and Stem Cell Biology Laboratory, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 27709.', 'Epigenetics and Stem Cell Biology Laboratory, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 27709.', 'Integrative Bioinformatics, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 27709.', 'Biostatistics and Computational Biology Branch, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 27709.', 'Epigenetics and Stem Cell Biology Laboratory, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 27709.', 'Epigenetics and Stem Cell Biology Laboratory, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 27709.', 'Division of Extramural Research and Training, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 27709.', 'Division of the National Toxicology Program, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 27709.', 'Epigenetics and Stem Cell Biology Laboratory, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 27709 wadep2@niehs.nih.gov.']",['eng'],['Z01 ES101965/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20180302,England,G3 (Bethesda),"G3 (Bethesda, Md.)",101566598,PMC5844302,['NOTNLM'],"['*B cell', '*DNA methylation', '*Dnmt3a', '*gene body', '*whole genome bisulfite sequencing']",2018/01/13 06:00,2018/10/31 06:00,['2018/01/13 06:00'],"['2018/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/31 06:00 [medline]', '2018/01/13 06:00 [entrez]']","['g3.117.300446 [pii]', '10.1534/g3.117.300446 [doi]']",epublish,G3 (Bethesda). 2018 Mar 2;8(3):805-813. doi: 10.1534/g3.117.300446.,20181030,3,"['0 (Dnmt3a protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA Methyltransferase 3A)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism', 'CpG Islands', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases/*genetics', '*DNA Methylation', 'DNA Methyltransferase 3A', 'Disease Susceptibility', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Knockout Techniques', 'Genome', 'Genomics/methods', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Phenotype', 'Spleen/cytology', 'Whole Genome Sequencing']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-7205-2414', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6042-357X']",['Copyright (c) 2018 Duncan et al.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cytokine array screening of 247 chronic lymphocytic leukemia serum samples revealed elevated levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-1 which were associated with poor clinical outcome. We detected a microenvironment-induced expression of TNF receptor-1 in chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells in vitro, and an aberrantly high expression of this receptor in the proliferation centers of patients' lymph nodes. Stimulation of TNF receptor-1 with TNF-alpha enhanced nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NFkappaB) activity and viability of chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells, which was inhibited by wogonin. The therapeutic effects of wogonin were analyzed in mice after adoptive transfer of Emu-T-cell leukemia 1 (TCL1) leukemic cells. Wogonin treatment prevented leukemia development when given early after transplantation. The treatment of full-blown leukemia resulted in the loss of the TNF receptor-1 on chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells and their mobilization to blood.

Disturbed transcription factor function can be the basis of (pre)malignancies such as myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Growth factor independence 1b (Gfi1b) is a repressing transcription factor regulating quiescence of hematopoietic stem cells and differentiation of erythrocytes and platelets. Here, we show that low expression of Gfi1b in blast cells is associated with an inferior prognosis of MDS and AML patients. Using different models of human MDS or AML, we demonstrate that AML development was accelerated with heterozygous loss of Gfi1b, and latency was further decreased when Gfi1b was conditionally deleted. Loss of Gfi1b significantly increased the number of leukemic stem cells with upregulation of genes involved in leukemia development. On a molecular level, we found that loss of Gfi1b led to epigenetic changes, increased levels of reactive oxygen species, as well as alteration in the p38/Akt/FoXO pathways. These results demonstrate that Gfi1b functions as an oncosuppressor in MDS and AML development.","['Thivakaran, Aniththa', 'Botezatu, Lacramioara', 'Hones, Judith M', 'Schutte, Judith', 'Vassen, Lothar', 'Al-Matary, Yahya S', 'Patnana, Pradeep', 'Zeller, Amos', 'Heuser, Michael', 'Thol, Felicitas', 'Gabdoulline, Razif', 'Olberding, Nadine', 'Frank, Daria', 'Suslo, Marina', 'Koster, Renata', 'Lennartz, Klaus', 'Gorgens, Andre', 'Giebel, Bernd', 'Opalka, Bertram', 'Duhrsen, Ulrich', 'Khandanpour, Cyrus']","['Thivakaran A', 'Botezatu L', 'Hones JM', 'Schutte J', 'Vassen L', 'Al-Matary YS', 'Patnana P', 'Zeller A', 'Heuser M', 'Thol F', 'Gabdoulline R', 'Olberding N', 'Frank D', 'Suslo M', 'Koster R', 'Lennartz K', 'Gorgens A', 'Giebel B', 'Opalka B', 'Duhrsen U', 'Khandanpour C']","['Department of Haematology, West German Cancer Center, University Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Department of Haematology, West German Cancer Center, University Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Department of Haematology, West German Cancer Center, University Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Department of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, University Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Department of Haematology, West German Cancer Center, University Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Department of Haematology, West German Cancer Center, University Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Department of Haematology, West German Cancer Center, University Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Department of Haematology, West German Cancer Center, University Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Department of Haematology, West German Cancer Center, University Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Department of Haematology, Haemostaseology, Oncology, and Stem Cell Transplantation, Medical University of Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Haematology, Haemostaseology, Oncology, and Stem Cell Transplantation, Medical University of Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Haematology, Haemostaseology, Oncology, and Stem Cell Transplantation, Medical University of Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Haematology, West German Cancer Center, University Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Department of Haematology, West German Cancer Center, University Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Department of Haematology, West German Cancer Center, University Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Department of Haematology, West German Cancer Center, University Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Institute for Cell Biology, University Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Institute for Transfusion Medicine, University Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Institute for Transfusion Medicine, University Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Department of Haematology, West German Cancer Center, University Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Department of Haematology, West German Cancer Center, University Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Department of Haematology, West German Cancer Center, University Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany cyrus.khandanpour@uk-essen.de.', 'Department of Medicine A, Hematology, Oncology and Pneumology, University Hospital Munster, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180111,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,PMC5865438,,,2018/01/13 06:00,2019/07/16 06:00,['2018/01/13 06:00'],"['2017/06/29 00:00 [received]', '2018/01/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/16 06:00 [medline]', '2018/01/13 06:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.2017.167288 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2017.167288 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2018 Apr;103(4):614-625. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2017.167288.

In this study, we evaluated and scored dysplasia in bone marrow (BM) specimens from 168 patients with de novo AML; none of these patients had cytogenetic abnormalities according to the 2016 World Health Organization Classification. We then performed targeted sequencing of diagnostic BM aspirates for recurrent mutations associated with myeloid malignancies. We found that cohesin pathway mutations [q (FDR-adjusted P)=0.046] were associated with a higher degree of megakaryocytic dysplasia and STAG2 mutations were marginally associated with greater myeloid lineage dysplasia (q=0.052). Frequent megakaryocytes with separated nuclear lobes were more commonly seen among cases with cohesin pathway mutations (q=0.010) and specifically in those with STAG2 mutations (q=0.010), as well as NPM1 mutations (q=0.022 when considering the presence of any vs no megakaryocytes with separated nuclear lobes). RAS pathway mutations (q=0.006) and FLT3-ITD (q=0.006) were significantly more frequent in cases without evaluable erythroid cells. In univariate analysis of the 153 patients treated with induction chemotherapy, NPM1 mutations were associated with longer event-free survival (EFS) (P=0.042), while RUNX1 (P=0.042), NF1 (P=0.040), frequent micromegakaryocytes (P=0.018) and presence of a subclone (P=0.002) were associated with shorter EFS. In multivariable modeling, NPM1 was associated with longer EFS, while presence of a subclone and frequent micromegakaryocytes remained significantly associated with shorter EFS.","['Weinberg, Olga K', 'Gibson, Christopher J', 'Blonquist, Traci M', 'Neuberg, Donna', 'Pozdnyakova, Olga', 'Kuo, Frank', 'Ebert, Benjamin L', 'Hasserjian, Robert P']","['Weinberg OK', 'Gibson CJ', 'Blonquist TM', 'Neuberg D', 'Pozdnyakova O', 'Kuo F', 'Ebert BL', 'Hasserjian RP']","[""Department of Pathology, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA olga.weinberg@childrens.harvard.edu."", ""Division of Hematology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA."", 'Department of Biostatistics and Computational Biology, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Biostatistics and Computational Biology, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', ""Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA."", ""Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA."", 'Department of Pathology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.']",['eng'],['P01 CA066996/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['Journal Article'],20180111,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,PMC5865424,,,2018/01/13 06:00,2019/07/16 06:00,['2018/01/13 06:00'],"['2017/09/29 00:00 [received]', '2018/01/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/16 06:00 [medline]', '2018/01/13 06:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.2017.181842 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2017.181842 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2018 Apr;103(4):626-633. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2017.181842.

CASE PRESENTATION: A fifty-one-year old female patient, initially diagnosed with FA in childhood on the basis of classic features and increased chromosomal breakage, and remarkable sun-sensitivity is described. She only ever had mild haematological abnormalities and no history of malignancy. To identify and characterise the genetic defect in this lady, who is one of the oldest reported FA patients, we used whole-exome sequencing for identification of causative mutations, and functionally characterized the cellular phenotype. Detection of the novel splice site mutation c.793-2A > G and the previously described missense mutation c.1765C > T (p.Arg589Trp) in XPF/ERCC4/FANCQ assign her as the third individual of complementation group FA-Q. Ectopic expression of wildtype, but not mutant, XPF/ERCC4/FANCQ, in patient-derived fibroblasts rescued cellular resistance to DNA interstrand-crosslinking agents. Patient derived FA-Q cells showed impaired nuclear excision repair capacity. However, mutated XPF/ERCC4/FANCQ protein in our patient's cells, as in the two other patients with FA-Q, was detectable on chromatin, in contrast to XP-F cells, where missense-mutant protein failed to properly translocate to the nucleus. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with FA characteristics and UV sensitivity should be tested for mutations in XPF/ERCC4/FANCQ. The missense mutation p.Arg589Trp was previously detected in patients diagnosed with Xeroderma pigmentosum or Cockayne syndrome. Hence, phenotypic manifestations associated with this XPF/ERCC4/ FANCQ mutation are highly variable.","['Popp, Isabell', 'Punekar, Maqsood', 'Telford, Nick', 'Stivaros, Stavros', 'Chandler, Kate', 'Minnis, Meenakshi', 'Castleton, Anna', 'Higham, Claire', 'Hopewell, Louise', 'Gareth Evans, D', 'Raams, Anja', 'Theil, Arjan F', 'Meyer, Stefan', 'Schindler, Detlev']","['Popp I', 'Punekar M', 'Telford N', 'Stivaros S', 'Chandler K', 'Minnis M', 'Castleton A', 'Higham C', 'Hopewell L', 'Gareth Evans D', 'Raams A', 'Theil AF', 'Meyer S', 'Schindler D']","['Department of Human Genetics, Biozentrum, University of Wurzburg, Am Hubland, 97074, Wurzburg, Germany.', 'Lancashire Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Preston, UK.', 'Oncology Cytogenetics, The Christie NHS Foundation Trust, Manchester, UK.', 'Institute of Population Health, Centre for Imaging Sciences, Faculty of Medical and Human Sciences, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK.', 'Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, Manchester, UK.', 'Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, Manchester, UK.', ""Department of Genetic Medicine, St Mary's Hospital, Central Manchester Foundation Trust, Manchester, UK."", 'Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, Manchester, UK.', ""Department of Genetic Medicine, St Mary's Hospital, Central Manchester Foundation Trust, Manchester, UK."", 'Department of Paediatric and Adolescent Oncology, The Christie NHS Foundation Trust, Manchester, UK.', 'Department of Paediatric and Adolescent Oncology, The Christie NHS Foundation Trust, Manchester, UK.', 'Centre for Endocrinology and Diabetes, Institute of Human Development, Faculty of Medical and Human Sciences, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK.', 'Department of Paediatric and Adolescent Oncology, The Christie NHS Foundation Trust, Manchester, UK.', ""Department of Genetic Medicine, St Mary's Hospital, Central Manchester Foundation Trust, Manchester, UK."", 'Department of Molecular Genetics, Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Molecular Genetics, Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, Manchester, UK. stefan.meyer@manchester.ac.uk.', 'Department of Paediatric and Adolescent Oncology, The Christie NHS Foundation Trust, Manchester, UK. stefan.meyer@manchester.ac.uk.', 'Stem Cell and Leukaemia Proteomics Laboratory, Faculty of Medical and Human Sciences, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK. stefan.meyer@manchester.ac.uk.', ""Department of Paediatric and Adolescent Oncology, Royal Manchester Children's Hospital, Manchester, UK. stefan.meyer@manchester.ac.uk."", 'Paediatric and Adolescent Oncology, Division of Cancer Sciences, University of Manchester, c/o Young Oncology Unit, Christie Hospital, Wilmslow Road, Manchester, M20 6XB, UK. stefan.meyer@manchester.ac.uk.', 'Department of Human Genetics, Biozentrum, University of Wurzburg, Am Hubland, 97074, Wurzburg, Germany. schindler@biozentrum.uni-wuerzburg.de.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180111,England,BMC Med Genet,BMC medical genetics,100968552,PMC5765604,['NOTNLM'],"['*DNA repair', '*ERCC4', '*FANCQ', '*Fanconi anemia', '*UV sensitivity', '*XPF']",2018/01/13 06:00,2018/12/18 06:00,['2018/01/13 06:00'],"['2017/03/03 00:00 [received]', '2018/01/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/12/18 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12881-018-0520-1 [doi]', '10.1186/s12881-018-0520-1 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Med Genet. 2018 Jan 11;19(1):7. doi: 10.1186/s12881-018-0520-1.,20181217,1,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (xeroderma pigmentosum group F protein)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Repair', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Fanconi Anemia/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Female', 'Fibroblasts', 'Genetic Association Studies', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation, Missense', 'Photosensitivity Disorders/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Solar System']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-2283-3690'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Acquired drug resistance in mutant Bcr-Abl has enhanced pathogenesis with the use of single therapy agents such as nilotinib. Moreover, allosteric targeting has been identified to consequentially inhibit Bcr-Abl activity, which led to the recent development of ABL-001 (asciminib) that selectively binds the myristoyl pocket. Experimental studies have revealed that the combination of nilotinib and ABL-001 induced a 'bent' conformation in the C-terminal helix of Bcr-Abl; a benchmark of inhibition, thereby exhibiting a greater potency in the treatment of CML, surmounting the setbacks of drug resistance, disease regression and relapse. Therefore, we report the first account of the dynamics and conformational analysis of oncogenic T334I Bcr-Abl by dual targeting. Our findings revealed that unlike in the Bcr-Abl-Nilotinib complex, dual targeting by both inhibitors induced the bent conformation in the C-terminal helix that varied with time.

Increasing evidence supports sustained and profound improvement in gastrointestinal parameters and quality of life following high-dose immunosuppressive therapy and autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplantation [AHSCT] compared to standard therapy in this context. In addition, international transplant registry data reflect the use of AHSCT in CD outside of trials in selected patients. However, AHSCT may be associated with significant treatment-related complications with risk of transplant-related mortality. In a joint initiative, the European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation [ECCO] and the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation [EBMT] have produced a state-of-the-art review of the rationale, evaluation, patient selection, stem cell mobilization and transplant procedures and long-term follow up. Given the unique spectrum of issues, we recommend that AHSCT should only be performed in experienced centres with expertise in both haematological and gastroenterological aspects of the procedure. Where possible, patients should be enrolled on clinical trials and data registered centrally.

These prospective studies from large trials compared auto-HCT with chemotherapy. A comparison was made also with allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT). These studies reported a lower relapse rate with auto-HCT compared with chemotherapy, but without impact on the overall survival. A high transplant-related mortality in that era confounded the relevance of these data. RECENT FINDINGS: Several prospective studies and a plethora of retrospective registry data have confirmed the potent antileukemic therapy of auto-HCT compared with chemotherapy and, in some instances, have even challenged the presumed superiority of allo-HCT as the definitive therapy for certain patients with AML. SUMMARY: The aggregate of recent data, prospective and retrospective, strongly suggests an important role for auto-HCT, at least as the most potent nonimmunologic antileukemia therapy. The transplant-related mortality in 2017 is close to that expected from standard consolidation therapy leading to the conclusion that the role of auto-HCT needs to be rigorously revisited, preferably in prospective studies, to establish its precise role in the current era.","['Ganzel, Chezi', 'Rowe, Jacob M']","['Ganzel C', 'Rowe JM']","['Department of Hematology, Shaare Zedek Medical Center, Jerusalem.', 'Department of Hematology, Shaare Zedek Medical Center, Jerusalem.', 'Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Rambam Healthcare Campus.', 'Bruce Rappaport Faculty of Medicine, Technion, Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,,,,2018/01/13 06:00,2019/01/12 06:00,['2018/01/12 06:00'],"['2018/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/12 06:00 [medline]', '2018/01/12 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/MOH.0000000000000408 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2018 Mar;25(2):95-102. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0000000000000408.,20190111,2,,IM,"['Autografts', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/mortality/*therapy', '*Registries']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mutations in DNMT3A are associated with hematological malignancies, most frequently acute myeloid leukemia. DNMT3A mutations are hypothesized to establish a pre-leukemic state, rendering cells vulnerable to secondary oncogenic mutations and malignant transformation. However, the mechanisms by which DNMT3A mutations contribute to leukemogenesis are not well-defined. Here, we successfully created four DNMT3A-mutated K562 cell lines with frameshift mutations resulting in truncated DNMT3A proteins. DNMT3A-mutated cell lines exhibited significantly impaired growth and increased apoptotic activity compared to wild-type (WT) cells. Consistent with previous studies, DNMT3A-mutated cells displayed impaired differentiation capacity. RNA-seq was used to compare transcriptomes of DNMT3A-mutated and WT cells; DNMT3A ablation resulted in downregulation of genes involved in spliceosome function, causing dysfunction of RNA splicing. Unexpectedly, we observed DNMT3A-mutated cells to exhibit marked genomic instability and an impaired DNA damage response compared to WT. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated DNMT3A-mutated K562 cells may be used to model effects of DNMT3A mutations in human cells. Our findings implicate aberrant splicing and induction of genomic instability as potential mechanisms by which DNMT3A mutations might predispose to malignancy.","['Banaszak, Lauren G', 'Giudice, Valentina', 'Zhao, Xin', 'Wu, Zhijie', 'Gao, Shouguo', 'Hosokawa, Kohei', 'Keyvanfar, Keyvan', 'Townsley, Danielle M', 'Gutierrez-Rodrigues, Fernanda', 'Fernandez Ibanez, Maria Del Pilar', 'Kajigaya, Sachiko', 'Young, Neal S']","['Banaszak LG', 'Giudice V', 'Zhao X', 'Wu Z', 'Gao S', 'Hosokawa K', 'Keyvanfar K', 'Townsley DM', 'Gutierrez-Rodrigues F', 'Fernandez Ibanez MDP', 'Kajigaya S', 'Young NS']","['Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Bethesda, MD 20892-1202, USA.

While 6TP has beneficial therapeutic uses, severe toxicities are also reported with its use, such as jaundice and liver toxicity. While numerous investigations into the mode in which toxicity originates has been undertaken. None have investigated the effects of inhibition towards UDP-Glucose Dehydrogenase (UDPGDH), an oxidative enzyme responsible for UDP-glucuronic acid (UDPGA) formation or UDP-Glucuronosyl transferase (UGT1A1), which is responsible for the conjugation of bilirubin with UDPGA for excretion. Failure to excrete bilirubin leads to jaundice and liver toxicity. We proposed that either 6TP or its primary oxidative excretion metabolites inhibit one or both of these enzymes, resulting in the observed toxicity from 6TP administration. Inhibition analysis of these purines revealed that 6-thiopurine has weak to no inhibition towards UDPGDH with a Ki of 288muM with regard to varying UDP-glucose, but 6-thiouric (primary end metabolite, fully oxidized at carbon 2 and 8, and highly retained by the body) has a near six-fold increased inhibition towards UDPGDH with a Ki of 7muM. Inhibition was also observed by 6-thioxanthine (oxidized at carbon 2) and 8-OH-6TP with Ki values of 54 and 14muM, respectively. Neither 6-thiopurine or its excretion metabolites were shown to inhibit UGT1A1. Our results show that the C2 and C8 positions of 6TP are pivotal in said inhibition towards UDPGDH and have no effect upon UGT1A1, and that blocking C8 could lead to new analogs with reduced, if not eliminated jaundice and liver toxicities.","['Weeramange, Chamitha J', 'Binns, Cassie M', 'Chen, Chixiang', 'Rafferty, Ryan J']","['Weeramange CJ', 'Binns CM', 'Chen C', 'Rafferty RJ']","['Department of Chemistry, Kansas State University, 1212 Mid-Campus Drive North, 203 CBC Building, Manhattan, KS 66506, United States.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Kansas State University, 1711 Claflin Road, Manhattan, KS 66506, United States.', 'Department of Statistics, Kansas State University, 101 Dickens Hall, Manhattan, KS 66506, United States.', 'Department of Chemistry, Kansas State University, 1212 Mid-Campus Drive North, 203 CBC Building, Manhattan, KS 66506, United States.

Mcl-1 upregulation is often found in many human cancers and is associated with high tumor grade, poor survival, and resistance to chemotherapy. Here, we describe a series of potent and selective tricyclic indole diazepinone Mcl-1 inhibitors that were discovered and further optimized using structure-based design. These compounds exhibit picomolar binding affinity and mechanism-based cellular efficacy, including growth inhibition and caspase induction in Mcl-1-sensitive cells. Thus, they represent useful compounds to study the implication of Mcl-1 inhibition in cancer and serve as potentially useful starting points toward the discovery of anti-Mcl-1 therapeutics.","['Shaw, Subrata', 'Bian, Zhiguo', 'Zhao, Bin', 'Tarr, James C', 'Veerasamy, Nagarathanam', 'Jeon, Kyu Ok', 'Belmar, Johannes', 'Arnold, Allison L', 'Fogarty, Stuart A', 'Perry, Evan', 'Sensintaffar, John L', 'Camper, DeMarco V', 'Rossanese, Olivia W', 'Lee, Taekyu', 'Olejniczak, Edward T', 'Fesik, Stephen W']","['Shaw S', 'Bian Z', 'Zhao B', 'Tarr JC', 'Veerasamy N', 'Jeon KO', 'Belmar J', 'Arnold AL', 'Fogarty SA', 'Perry E', 'Sensintaffar JL', 'Camper DV', 'Rossanese OW', 'Lee T', 'Olejniczak ET', 'Fesik SW']","['Department of Biochemistry , Vanderbilt University School of Medicine , 2215 Garland Avenue, 607 Light Hall , Nashville , Tennessee 37232-0146 , United States.', 'Department of Biochemistry , Vanderbilt University School of Medicine , 2215 Garland Avenue, 607 Light Hall , Nashville , Tennessee 37232-0146 , United States.', 'Department of Biochemistry , Vanderbilt University School of Medicine , 2215 Garland Avenue, 607 Light Hall , Nashville , Tennessee 37232-0146 , United States.', 'Department of Biochemistry , Vanderbilt University School of Medicine , 2215 Garland Avenue, 607 Light Hall , Nashville , Tennessee 37232-0146 , United States.', 'Department of Biochemistry , Vanderbilt University School of Medicine , 2215 Garland Avenue, 607 Light Hall , Nashville , Tennessee 37232-0146 , United States.', 'Department of Biochemistry , Vanderbilt University School of Medicine , 2215 Garland Avenue, 607 Light Hall , Nashville , Tennessee 37232-0146 , United States.', 'Department of Biochemistry , Vanderbilt University School of Medicine , 2215 Garland Avenue, 607 Light Hall , Nashville , Tennessee 37232-0146 , United States.', 'Department of Biochemistry , Vanderbilt University School of Medicine , 2215 Garland Avenue, 607 Light Hall , Nashville , Tennessee 37232-0146 , United States.', 'Department of Biochemistry , Vanderbilt University School of Medicine , 2215 Garland Avenue, 607 Light Hall , Nashville , Tennessee 37232-0146 , United States.', 'Department of Biochemistry , Vanderbilt University School of Medicine , 2215 Garland Avenue, 607 Light Hall , Nashville , Tennessee 37232-0146 , United States.', 'Department of Biochemistry , Vanderbilt University School of Medicine , 2215 Garland Avenue, 607 Light Hall , Nashville , Tennessee 37232-0146 , United States.', 'Department of Biochemistry , Vanderbilt University School of Medicine , 2215 Garland Avenue, 607 Light Hall , Nashville , Tennessee 37232-0146 , United States.', 'Department of Biochemistry , Vanderbilt University School of Medicine , 2215 Garland Avenue, 607 Light Hall , Nashville , Tennessee 37232-0146 , United States.', 'Department of Biochemistry , Vanderbilt University School of Medicine , 2215 Garland Avenue, 607 Light Hall , Nashville , Tennessee 37232-0146 , United States.', 'Department of Biochemistry , Vanderbilt University School of Medicine , 2215 Garland Avenue, 607 Light Hall , Nashville , Tennessee 37232-0146 , United States.', 'Department of Biochemistry , Vanderbilt University School of Medicine , 2215 Garland Avenue, 607 Light Hall , Nashville , Tennessee 37232-0146 , United States.']",['eng'],['11566/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20180309,United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,,,,2018/01/13 06:00,2019/04/18 06:00,['2018/01/12 06:00'],"['2018/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/18 06:00 [medline]', '2018/01/12 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/acs.jmedchem.7b01155 [doi]'],ppublish,J Med Chem. 2018 Mar 22;61(6):2410-2421. doi: 10.1021/acs.jmedchem.7b01155.

We are testing a promising strategy to improve its clinical efficacy by direct delivery of Ara-FATP utilizing a biocompatible glycodendrimer nanocarrier system. Here, we present results of a proof-of-concept experiment in several in vitro-cultured leukemic cell lines (CCRF, THP-1, U937) using noncovalent complexes of maltose-modified poly(propyleneimine) dendrimer and fludarabine triphosphate. We show that Ara-FATP has limited cytotoxic activity toward investigated cells relative to free nucleoside (Ara-FA), but complexation with the glycodendrimer (which does not otherwise influence cellular metabolism) drastically increases its toxicity. Moreover, we show that transport via hENT1 is a limiting step in Ara-FA toxicity, while complexation with dendrimer allows Ara-FATP to kill cells even in the presence of a hENT1 inhibitor. Thus, the use of glycodendrimers for drug delivery would allow us to circumvent naturally occurring drug resistance due to decreased transporter activity. Finally, we demonstrate that complex formation does not change the advantageous multifactorial intracellular pharmacodynamics of Ara-FATP, preserving its high capability to inhibit DNA and RNA synthesis and induce apoptosis via the intrinsic pathway. In comparison to other nucleoside analogue drugs, fludarabine is hereby demonstrated to be an optimal candidate for maltose glycodendrimer-mediated drug delivery in antileukemic therapy.","['Gorzkiewicz, Michal', 'Jatczak-Pawlik, Izabela', 'Studzian, Maciej', 'Pulaski, Lukasz', 'Appelhans, Dietmar', 'Voit, Brigitte', 'Klajnert-Maculewicz, Barbara']","['Gorzkiewicz M', 'Jatczak-Pawlik I', 'Studzian M', 'Pulaski L', 'Appelhans D', 'Voit B', 'Klajnert-Maculewicz B']","['Laboratory of Transcriptional Regulation, Institute of Medical Biology PAS , 106 Lodowa Street, 93-232 Lodz, Poland.', 'Leibniz Institute of Polymer Research Dresden, Hohe Str. 6, 01069 Dresden, Germany.', 'Leibniz Institute of Polymer Research Dresden, Hohe Str. 6, 01069 Dresden, Germany.', 'Leibniz Institute of Polymer Research Dresden, Hohe Str. 6, 01069 Dresden, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180130,United States,Biomacromolecules,Biomacromolecules,100892849,,,,2018/01/13 06:00,2018/11/15 06:00,['2018/01/12 06:00'],"['2018/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/11/15 06:00 [medline]', '2018/01/12 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/acs.biomac.7b01650 [doi]'],ppublish,Biomacromolecules. 2018 Feb 12;19(2):531-543. doi: 10.1021/acs.biomac.7b01650.

Golgi alpha-mannosidase II (GMII) has become a therapeutic target for drugs with anticancer activities. One critical task for successful application of GMII drugs in medical treatments is to decrease their unwanted co-inhibition of lysosomal alpha-mannosidase (LMan), a weakness of all known potent GMII inhibitors. A series of novel N-substituted polyhydroxypyrrolidines was synthesized and tested with modeled GH38 alpha-mannosidases from Drosophila melanogaster (GMIIb and LManII). The most potent structures inhibited GMIIb (Ki =50-76 mum, as determined by enzyme assays) with a significant selectivity index of IC50 (LManII)/IC50 (GMIIb) >100. These compounds also showed inhibitory activities in in vitro assays with cancer cell lines (leukemia, IC50 =92-200 mum) and low cytotoxic activities in normal fibroblast cell lines (IC50 >200 mum). In addition, they did not show any significant inhibitory activity toward GH47 Aspergillus saitoialpha1,2-mannosidase. An appropriate stereo configuration of hydroxymethyl and benzyl functional groups on the pyrrolidine ring of the inhibitor may lead to an inhibitor with the required selectivity for the active site of a target alpha-mannosidase.","['Sestak, Sergej', 'Bella, Maros', 'Klunda, Tomas', 'Gurska, Sona', 'Dzubak, Petr', 'Wols, Florian', 'Wilson, Iain B H', 'Sladek, Vladimir', 'Hajduch, Marian', 'Polakova, Monika', 'Kona, Juraj']","['Sestak S', 'Bella M', 'Klunda T', 'Gurska S', 'Dzubak P', 'Wols F', 'Wilson IBH', 'Sladek V', 'Hajduch M', 'Polakova M', 'Kona J']","['Institute of Chemistry, Center for Glycomics, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Dubravska cesta 9, 845 38, Bratislava, Slovakia.', 'Institute of Chemistry, Center for Glycomics, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Dubravska cesta 9, 845 38, Bratislava, Slovakia.', 'Institute of Chemistry, Center for Glycomics, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Dubravska cesta 9, 845 38, Bratislava, Slovakia.', 'Laboratory of Experimental Medicine, Institute of Molecular and Translational Medicine, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, Palacky University and University Hospital in Olomouc, Puskinova 6, 775 20, Olomouc, Czech Republic.', 'Laboratory of Experimental Medicine, Institute of Molecular and Translational Medicine, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, Palacky University and University Hospital in Olomouc, Puskinova 6, 775 20, Olomouc, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Chemistry, University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences, 1190, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Chemistry, University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences, 1190, Vienna, Austria.', 'Institute of Chemistry, Center for Glycomics, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Dubravska cesta 9, 845 38, Bratislava, Slovakia.', 'Laboratory of Experimental Medicine, Institute of Molecular and Translational Medicine, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, Palacky University and University Hospital in Olomouc, Puskinova 6, 775 20, Olomouc, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Chemistry, Center for Glycomics, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Dubravska cesta 9, 845 38, Bratislava, Slovakia.', 'Institute of Chemistry, Center for Glycomics, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Dubravska cesta 9, 845 38, Bratislava, Slovakia.']",['eng'],['P 29466/Austrian Science Fund FWF/Austria'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180206,Germany,ChemMedChem,ChemMedChem,101259013,PMC6176901,['NOTNLM'],"['*Golgi alpha-mannosidase II', '*cytotoxicity', '*molecular modeling', '*pyrrolidines', '*swainsonine']",2018/01/13 06:00,2019/01/23 06:00,['2018/01/12 06:00'],"['2017/09/29 00:00 [received]', '2018/01/04 00:00 [revised]', '2018/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/23 06:00 [medline]', '2018/01/12 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cmdc.201700607 [doi]'],ppublish,ChemMedChem. 2018 Feb 20;13(4):373-383. doi: 10.1002/cmdc.201700607.

Methods The study included 39 371 leukemia, 56 713 non-Hodgkin lymphoma, 9322 Hodgkin lymphoma, and 26 188 multiple myeloma cases diagnosed between 1961 and 2005 in Finland, Sweden, and Iceland. Five controls for each case were selected from the Nordic Occupational Cancer Study (NOCCA) cohort, matched by year of birth, sex and country. Night-shift exposure was assessed by using the NOCCA job-exposure matrix (JEM). Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated from conditional logistic regression models. Results Overall, night work was not associated with a risk of hematological cancers. We observed a small but non-significantly increased risk for leukemia (OR 1.07, 95% CI 0.99-1.16), especially for acute myeloid leukemia (OR 1.15, 95% CI 0.97-1.36) among workers exposed to a high level of cumulative night work exposure.

Research to delineate the mechanisms of targeting H3K4 methyltransferases is ongoing. The oocyte provides an attractive system to investigate these mechanisms, because extensive H3K4me3 acquisition occurs in nondividing cells. We developed low-input chromatin immunoprecipitation to interrogate H3K4me3, H3K27ac and H3K27me3 marks throughout oogenesis. In nongrowing oocytes, H3K4me3 was restricted to active promoters, but as oogenesis progressed, H3K4me3 accumulated in a transcription-independent manner and was targeted to intergenic regions, putative enhancers and silent H3K27me3-marked promoters. Ablation of the H3K4 methyltransferase gene Mll2 resulted in loss of transcription-independent H3K4 trimethylation but had limited effects on transcription-coupled H3K4 trimethylation or gene expression. Deletion of Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b showed that DNA methylation protects regions from acquiring H3K4me3. Our findings reveal two independent mechanisms of targeting H3K4me3 to genomic elements, with MLL2 recruited to unmethylated CpG-rich regions independently of transcription.","['Hanna, Courtney W', 'Taudt, Aaron', 'Huang, Jiahao', 'Gahurova, Lenka', 'Kranz, Andrea', 'Andrews, Simon', 'Dean, Wendy', 'Stewart, A Francis', 'Colome-Tatche, Maria', 'Kelsey, Gavin']","['Hanna CW', 'Taudt A', 'Huang J', 'Gahurova L', 'Kranz A', 'Andrews S', 'Dean W', 'Stewart AF', 'Colome-Tatche M', 'Kelsey G']","['Epigenetics Programme, Babraham Institute, Cambridge, UK.', 'Centre for Trophoblast Research, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.', 'Institute of Computational Biology, Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, Neuherberg, Germany.', 'European Research Institute for the Biology of Ageing, University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.', 'Epigenetics Programme, Babraham Institute, Cambridge, UK.', 'University of South Bohemia, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Animal Physiology and Genetics, ASCR, Libechov, Czech Republic.', 'Biotechnology Center TU Dresden, Tatzberg, Germany.', 'Bioinformatics Group, Babraham Institute, Cambridge, UK.', 'Epigenetics Programme, Babraham Institute, Cambridge, UK.', 'Biotechnology Center TU Dresden, Tatzberg, Germany. francis.stewart@tu-dresden.de.', 'Institute of Computational Biology, Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, Neuherberg, Germany.', 'European Research Institute for the Biology of Ageing, University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.', 'TUM School of Life Sciences Weihenstephan, Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'Epigenetics Programme, Babraham Institute, Cambridge, UK. gavin.kelsey@babraham.ac.uk.', 'Centre for Trophoblast Research, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK. gavin.kelsey@babraham.ac.uk.']",['eng'],['MR/K011332/1/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180101,United States,Nat Struct Mol Biol,Nature structural & molecular biology,101186374,,,,2018/01/13 06:00,2019/07/25 06:00,['2018/01/12 06:00'],"['2017/07/19 00:00 [received]', '2017/11/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/25 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41594-017-0013-5 [doi]', '10.1038/s41594-017-0013-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Nat Struct Mol Biol. 2018 Jan;25(1):73-82. doi: 10.1038/s41594-017-0013-5.

Different racial groups differ significantly in multiple aspects. Our goal is to systematically and comprehensively quantify racial differences in leukemia. The SEER database is analyzed, and comprehensive descriptive analysis is provided for the four major subtypes, namely ALL (acute lymphoblastic leukemia), CLL (chronic lymphoblastic leukemia), AML (acute myeloid leukemia), and CML (chronic myeloid leukemia), and for two age groups (</=14 and >14) separately. The racial groups studied include NHW (non-Hispanic White), HW (Hispanic White), BL (Black), and API (Asian and Pacific Islander). Univariate and multivariate analyses are conducted to quantify racial differences in patients' characteristics, incidence, and survival. For patients' characteristics, significant racial differences are observed in gender, age at diagnosis, diagnosis era, using radiation for treatment, registry, cancer history, and histology type.

We provide safety data from a randomized, phase 3 trial evaluating lenalidomide in 239 patients with lower-risk non-del(5q) MDS ineligible/refractory to erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs). Compared with placebo, lenalidomide was associated with a higher incidence of grade 3-4 treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs; 86% vs. 44%), but not risk of infection (p = .817) or hemorrhagic events (p = 1.000). Grade 3-4 non-hematologic TEAEs were rare (the incidence of grade 3-4 pneumonia, e.g. was 5.6% in the lenalidomide group and 2.5% in the placebo group). Common grade 1-2 non-hematologic TEAEs did not require dose modifications or treatment discontinuation. Acute myeloid leukemia and second primary malignancies incidence was similar across treatment groups.

Platelet activation is largely mediated through ADP engagement of purinergic P2Y12 receptors on platelets. We examined the potential of the reversible P2Y12 inhibitor ticagrelor, an agent used clinically to prevent cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events, to reduce tumor growth and metastasis. In vitro, MCF-7, MDA-MB-468, and MDA-MB-231 human mammary carcinoma cells exhibited decreased interaction with platelets treated with ticagrelor compared to untreated platelets. Prevention of tumor cell-platelet interactions through pretreatment of platelets with ticagrelor did not improve natural killer cell-mediated tumor cell killing of K562 myelogenous leukemia target cells. Additionally, ticagrelor had no effect on proliferation of 4T1 mouse mammary carcinoma cells co-cultured with platelets, or on primary 4T1 tumor growth. In an orthotopic 4T1 breast cancer model, ticagrelor (10 mg/kg), but not clopidogrel (10 mg/kg) or saline, resulted in reduced metastasis and improved survival. Ticagrelor treatment was associated with a marked reduction in tumor cell-platelet aggregates in the lungs at 10, 30 and 60 min post-intravenous inoculation. These findings suggest a role for P2Y12-mediated platelet activation in promoting metastasis, and provide support for the use of ticagrelor in the prevention of breast cancer spread.","['Gareau, Alison J', 'Brien, Colin', 'Gebremeskel, Simon', 'Liwski, Robert S', 'Johnston, Brent', 'Bezuhly, Michael']","['Gareau AJ', 'Brien C', 'Gebremeskel S', 'Liwski RS', 'Johnston B', 'Bezuhly M']","['Department of Microbiology & Immunology, Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS, Canada.', 'Izaak Walton Killam Health Centre, Halifax, NS, Canada.', 'School of Medicine, University College Cork, Cork, Ireland.', 'Department of Microbiology & Immunology, Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS, Canada.', 'Department of Microbiology & Immunology, Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS, Canada.', 'Department of Pathology, Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS, Canada.', 'Department of Microbiology & Immunology, Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS, Canada.', 'Department of Pathology, Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS, Canada.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS, Canada.', 'Department of Microbiology & Immunology, Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS, Canada. mbezuhly@dal.ca.', 'Izaak Walton Killam Health Centre, Halifax, NS, Canada. mbezuhly@dal.ca.', 'Division of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, Department of Surgery, Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS, Canada. mbezuhly@dal.ca.', 'Department of Surgery, Dalhousie University, IWK Health Centre, 5850/5980 University Avenue, PO Box 9700, Halifax, NS, B3K 6R8, Canada. mbezuhly@dal.ca.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180111,Netherlands,Clin Exp Metastasis,Clinical & experimental metastasis,8409970,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Breast cancer', '*Metastasis', '*Natural killer cells', '*P2Y12', '*Platelets', '*Ticagrelor']",2018/01/13 06:00,2019/02/12 06:00,['2018/01/12 06:00'],"['2017/08/10 00:00 [received]', '2018/01/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/02/12 06:00 [medline]', '2018/01/12 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s10585-018-9874-1 [doi]', '10.1007/s10585-018-9874-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Clin Exp Metastasis. 2018 Feb;35(1-2):25-35. doi: 10.1007/s10585-018-9874-1.

It has multiple interaction partners, with functions varying from the regulation of neuronal development and intracellular transport mechanisms to transcription regulation. One of its interactors is retinoic acid receptor (RAR), which is activated by retinoic acid and controls many target genes and physiological process. Based on previous evidence suggesting a possible nuclear role for FEZ1, we wanted to deepen our understanding of this function by addressing the FEZ1-RAR interaction. We performed in vitro binding experiments and assessed the interface of interaction between both proteins. We found that FEZ1-RAR interacted with a similar magnitude as RAR to its responsive element DR5 and that the interaction occurred in the coiled-coil region of FEZ1 and in the ligand-binding domain of RAR. Furthermore, cellular experiments were performed in order to confirm the interaction and screen for induced target genes from an 86-gene panel. The analysis of gene expression showed that only in the presence of retinoic acid did FEZ1 induce hoxb4 gene expression. This finding is consistent with data from the literature showing the hoxb4 gene functionally involved in development and acute myeloid leukemia, as is FEZ1.","['Bertini Teixeira, Mariana', 'Figueira, Ana Carolina M', 'Furlan, Ariane S', 'Aquino, Bruno', 'Alborghetti, Marcos R', 'Paes Leme, Adriana F', 'Wei, Li-Na', 'Kobarg, Jorg']","['Bertini Teixeira M', 'Figueira ACM', 'Furlan AS', 'Aquino B', 'Alborghetti MR', 'Paes Leme AF', 'Wei LN', 'Kobarg J']","['Department of Biochemistry and Tissue Biology Institute of Biology University of Campinas Brazil.', 'Spectroscopy and Calorimetry Laboratory Brazilian Biosciences National Laboratory Center for Research in Energy and Materials Campinas SP Brazil.', 'Department of Biochemistry Universitat zu Koln Germany.', 'Structural Genomics Consortium University of Campinas Brazil.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences School of Health Sciences University of Brasilia Brazil.', 'Mass Spectrometry Laboratory Brazilian Biosciences National Laboratory Center for Research in Energy and Materials Campinas SP Brazil.', 'Pharmacology Department University of Minnesota Medical School Minneapolis MN USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Tissue Biology Institute of Biology University of Campinas Brazil.', 'Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences University of Campinas Brazil.']",['eng'],"['R01 DK054733/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK060521/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",['Journal Article'],20171209,England,FEBS Open Bio,FEBS open bio,101580716,PMC5757173,['NOTNLM'],"['*FEZ', '*RAR', '*gene regulation', '*nuclear function', '*retinoic acid', '*transcription']",2018/01/13 06:00,2018/01/13 06:01,['2018/01/12 06:00'],"['2016/10/10 00:00 [received]', '2017/08/27 00:00 [revised]', '2017/10/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/13 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1002/2211-5463.12338 [doi]', 'FEB412338 [pii]']",epublish,FEBS Open Bio. 2017 Dec 9;8(1):4-14. doi: 10.1002/2211-5463.12338. eCollection 2018 Jan.,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Two hundred bone marrow samples were obtained at diagnosis from 200 consecutive patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) were studied between September 2008 and December 2010 at our Institution (Hematology Department, Lyon, France). The CD34/CD38 cell profile was analyzed by multiparameter flowcytometry approach using 8C panels and FACS CANTO and Diva software (BD Bioscience). RESULTS: We analyzed CD34 and CD38 expression in bone marrow samples of 200 AML patients at diagnosis, and investigated the prognostic value of the most immature CD34+CD38- population. Using a cut-off value of 1% of CD34+CD38- from total ""bulk leukemic cells"" we found that a high (> 1%) level of CD34+CD38- blasts at diagnosis was correlated with advanced age, adverse cytogenetics as well as with a lower rate of complete response after induction and shorter disease-free survival. In a multivariate analysis considering age, leukocytosis, the % of CD34+ blasts cells and the standardized cytogenetic and molecular risk subgroups, a percentage of CD34+CD38- leukemic cells > 1% was an independent predictor of DFS [HR = 2.8 (1.02-7.73), P = 0.04] and OS [HR = 2.65 (1.09-6.43), P = 0.03]. CONCLUSION: Taken together, these results show that a CD34/CD38 ""backbone"" for leukemic cell analysis by multicolour flowcytometry at diagnosis provides useful prognostic information.","['Plesa, Adriana', 'Dumontet, Charles', 'Mattei, Eve', 'Tagoug, Ines', 'Hayette, Sandrine', 'Sujobert, Pierre', 'Tigaud, Isabelle', 'Pages, Marie Pierre', 'Chelghoum, Youcef', 'Baracco, Fiorenza', 'Labussierre, Helene', 'Ducastelle, Sophie', 'Paubelle, Etienne', 'Nicolini, Franck Emmanuel', 'Elhamri, Mohamed', 'Campos, Lydia', 'Plesa, Claudiu', 'Morisset, Stephane', 'Salles, Gilles', 'Bertrand, Yves', 'Michallet, Mauricette', 'Thomas, Xavier']","['Plesa A', 'Dumontet C', 'Mattei E', 'Tagoug I', 'Hayette S', 'Sujobert P', 'Tigaud I', 'Pages MP', 'Chelghoum Y', 'Baracco F', 'Labussierre H', 'Ducastelle S', 'Paubelle E', 'Nicolini FE', 'Elhamri M', 'Campos L', 'Plesa C', 'Morisset S', 'Salles G', 'Bertrand Y', 'Michallet M', 'Thomas X']","['Laboratory of Hematology, Lyon-Sud Hospital, Hospices Civils de Lyon, Pierre - Benite Cedex 69495, France.', 'Laboratory of Hematology, Lyon-Sud Hospital, Hospices Civils de Lyon, Pierre - Benite Cedex 69495, France.', 'Laboratory of Hematology, Lyon-Sud Hospital, Hospices Civils de Lyon, Pierre - Benite Cedex 69495, France.', 'CRCL, INSERM 1052/CNRS 5286, Lyon FR-69008, France.', 'Laboratory of Hematology, Lyon-Sud Hospital, Hospices Civils de Lyon, Pierre - Benite Cedex 69495, France.', 'Laboratory of Hematology, Lyon-Sud Hospital, Hospices Civils de Lyon, Pierre - Benite Cedex 69495, France.', 'Laboratory of Hematology, Lyon-Sud Hospital, Hospices Civils de Lyon, Pierre - Benite Cedex 69495, France.', 'Laboratory of Hematology, Lyon-Sud Hospital, Hospices Civils de Lyon, Pierre - Benite Cedex 69495, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospices Civils de Lyon, Pierre - Benite Cedex 69495, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospices Civils de Lyon, Pierre - Benite Cedex 69495, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospices Civils de Lyon, Pierre - Benite Cedex 69495, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospices Civils de Lyon, Pierre - Benite Cedex 69495, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospices Civils de Lyon, Pierre - Benite Cedex 69495, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospices Civils de Lyon, Pierre - Benite Cedex 69495, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospices Civils de Lyon, Pierre - Benite Cedex 69495, France.', 'Laboratory of Hematology, Nord Hospital, Saint Etienne 42055, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospices Civils de Lyon, Pierre - Benite Cedex 69495, France.', 'Statistical and Clinical Research, Lyon-Sud Hospital, Hospices Civils de Lyon, Pierre - Benite Cedex 69495, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospices Civils de Lyon, Pierre - Benite Cedex 69495, France.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and BMT, IHOP Lyon, Lyon 69001, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospices Civils de Lyon, Pierre - Benite Cedex 69495, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospices Civils de Lyon, Pierre - Benite Cedex 69495, France.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,World J Stem Cells,World journal of stem cells,101535826,PMC5746643,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'CD34+CD38-/low', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemic stem cells', 'Prognosis']",2018/01/13 06:00,2018/01/13 06:01,['2018/01/12 06:00'],"['2017/01/29 00:00 [received]', '2017/10/17 00:00 [revised]', '2017/11/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/13 06:01 [medline]']",['10.4252/wjsc.v9.i12.227 [doi]'],ppublish,World J Stem Cells. 2017 Dec 26;9(12):227-234. doi: 10.4252/wjsc.v9.i12.227.,,12,,,,,,"['Conflict-of-interest statement: None of the authors have anything to disclose', 'regarding this study.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This may be an important reason why immune checkpoint inhibitors are mainly effective in tumors with a high mutational burden. Reasons for clinically insufficient responses to neoantigens might be inefficient priming, inhibition, or deletion of the cognate T cells. Responses can be dramatically improved by cancer immunotherapy such as checkpoint inhibition, but often with temporary effects. By contrast, T cells from human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched donors can cure diseases such as chronic myeloid leukemia. The therapeutic effect is mediated by donor T cells recognizing polymorphic peptides for which the donor and patient are disparate, presented on self-HLA. Donor T-cell repertoires are unbiased by the immunosuppressive environment of the tumor. A recent study demonstrated that T cells from healthy individuals are able to respond to neoantigens that are ignored by tumor-infiltrating T cells of melanoma patients. In this review, we discuss possible reasons why neoantigens escape host T cells and how these limitations may be overcome by utilization of donor-derived T-cell repertoires to facilitate rational design of neoantigen-targeted immunotherapy.","['Karpanen, Terhi', 'Olweus, Johanna']","['Karpanen T', 'Olweus J']","['Department of Cancer Immunology, Institute for Cancer Research, Oslo University Hospital Radiumhospitalet, and K.G.

However, only a very small percentage of parents donate upon delivery. The decision to donate the cord blood occurs at a very specific time and when parents likely experience emotional, informational, and decisional overloads; these features of cord blood donation make it different from other pro-social activities. In collaboration with an OB-GYN clinic in Milan, Italy, we conducted the first randomized controlled trial that applies tools from behavioral science to foster cord blood donation, and quantified the gains that informational and behavioral ""nudges"" can achieve. We found that information and ""soft"" commitments increased donations; approaching expecting parents closer to the delivery date and providing them with multiple reminders, moreover, had the strongest impact. However, a significant portion of women who expressed consent to donate could not do so because of organizational constraints. We conclude that simple, non-invasive behavioral interventions that address information gaps and procrastination, and that increase the salience of the activity can substantially enhance altruistic donations of cord blood, especially when coupled with organizational support.","['Grieco, Daniela', 'Lacetera, Nicola', 'Macis, Mario', 'Di Martino, Daniela']","['Grieco D', 'Lacetera N', 'Macis M', 'Di Martino D']","['Universita Bocconi, Milan, Italy. daniela.grieco@unibocconi.it.', 'University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada. nicola.lacetera@utoronto.ca.', 'Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, USA. mmacis@jhu.edu.', ""Department of Woman, Mother, and Neonate, Buzzi Children's Hospital, Biological and Clinical Sciences, University of Milan, Milan, Italy.""]",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180110,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,PMC5762860,,,2018/01/13 06:00,2018/11/18 06:00,['2018/01/12 06:00'],"['2017/07/12 00:00 [received]', '2017/12/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/11/18 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-017-18679-y [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-017-18679-y [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2018 Jan 10;8(1):252. doi: 10.1038/s41598-017-18679-y.,20181116,1,,IM,"['Adult', 'Blood Banks', 'Blood Donors/*psychology', 'Female', '*Fetal Blood', 'Humans', 'Informed Consent', 'Intention', 'Italy', '*Motivation', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1541-5236'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As a consequence, point-of-care devices have an increasing importance for routine screening applications in the health sector due to their portability, fast analyses and decreased cost. For that purpose, a multifunctional chip was developed and tested using gold nanoprobes to perform RNA optical detection inside a microfluidic chip without the need of molecular amplification steps. As a proof-of-concept, this device was used for the rapid detection of chronic myeloid leukemia, a hemato-oncological disease that would benefit from early stage diagnostics and screening tests. The chip passively mixed target RNA from samples, gold nanoprobes and saline solution to infer a result from their final colorimetric properties. An optical fiber network was used to evaluate its transmitted spectra inside the chip. Trials provided accurate output results within 3 min, yielding signal-to-noise ratios up to 9 dB. When compared to actual state-of-art screening techniques of chronic myeloid leukemia, these results were, at microscale, at least 10 times faster than the reported detection methods for chronic myeloid leukemia.

The utility of next-generation sequencing information in decision making for IR-AML has yet to be elucidated. We retrospectively studied 100 IR-AML patients, defined by European Leukemia Net classification, who had mutational information at diagnosis, received intensive chemotherapy and achieved complete remission (CR) at Cleveland Clinic (CC). The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data were used for validation. In the CC cohort, median age was 58.5 years, 64% had normal cytogenetics, and 31% required >1 induction cycles to achieve CR1. In univariable analysis, patients carrying mutations in DNMT3A, U2AF1, and EZH2 had worse overall and relapse-free survival. After adjusting for other variables, the presence of these mutations maintained an independent effect on survival in both CC and TCGA cohorts. Patients who did not have the mutations and underwent hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) had the best outcomes. HCT improved outcomes for patients who had these mutations. RUNX1 or ASXL1 mutations did not predict survival, and performance of HCT did not confer a significant survival benefit.

However, few studies on factors influencing the efficiency have been reported. In this study, 67 cases who underwent leukapheresis were retrospectively analysed and factors related to the collection efficiency of leukapheresis (CEWBC) were also evaluated. Paired t test showed that there was a significant decrease in statistics of white blood cell (WBC) counts after apheresis. The results of two independent samples nonparametric test suggested that WBC counts, platelet (PLT) counts, haematocrit (HCT), hemoglobin (HGB), serum chlorine (Cl) and globulin (GLB) before leukapheresis correlated with the CEWBC. Multiple linear regression analysis with background stepwise variable selection indicated that only WBC and HCT before leukapheresis had an influence on CEWBC significantly. Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox regression model indicated that lymphocyte (LY) and mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) pre-apheresis as independent factors significantly affected the prognostic survival of patients with HLL. Moreover, platelets and red blood cell were contaminated in the product of leukapheresis. It is an urgent problem to be solved in order to realise higher efficacy and higher purity of WBC collection to improve the survival of patients with HLL through optimising instruments.","['Jin, Yanxia', 'Guo, Shishang', 'Cui, Qin', 'Chen, Sichao', 'Liu, Xiaoping', 'Wei, Yongchang', 'Pan, Yunbao', 'Tang, Liang', 'Huang, Tingting', 'Shen, Hui', 'Xu, Guanghui', 'Zuo, Xuelan', 'Liu, Shangqin', 'Xiao, Hui', 'Chen, Fei', 'Gong, Fayun', 'Zhou, Fuling']","['Jin Y', 'Guo S', 'Cui Q', 'Chen S', 'Liu X', 'Wei Y', 'Pan Y', 'Tang L', 'Huang T', 'Shen H', 'Xu G', 'Zuo X', 'Liu S', 'Xiao H', 'Chen F', 'Gong F', 'Zhou F']","['Department of Hematology, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Artificial Micro- and Nano-Structures of Ministry of Education, School of Physics and Technology, Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Tumor Biological Behavior of Hubei Province, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Department of Radiation and Medical Oncology, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Department of Radiation and Medical Oncology, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'School of Mechanical Engineering, Hubei University of Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'School of Mechanical Engineering, Hubei University of Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'School of Mechanical Engineering, Hubei University of Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China. 541759505@qq.com.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China. zhoufuling@whu.edu.cn.', 'Key Laboratory of Tumor Biological Behavior of Hubei Province, Wuhan, Hubei, China. zhoufuling@whu.edu.cn.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China. zhoufuling@whu.edu.cn.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180110,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,PMC5762875,,,2018/01/13 06:00,2018/11/22 06:00,['2018/01/12 06:00'],"['2017/06/16 00:00 [received]', '2017/11/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/11/22 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-017-17534-4 [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-017-17534-4 [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2018 Jan 10;8(1):294. doi: 10.1038/s41598-017-17534-4.,20181121,1,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', '*Leukapheresis/methods', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/mortality/*therapy', 'Leukocytes', 'Leukocytosis/*diagnosis/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Young Adult']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6311-2945'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we used mouse ESCs to study the function of Tlk1 in pluripotent cells. The knockdown (KD)-based Tlk1-deficient cells showed that Tlk1 is not essential for ESC self-renewal in an undifferentiated state. However, Tlk1-KD cells formed irregularly shaped embryoid bodies and induced resistance to differentiation cues, indicating their failure to differentiate into an embryoid body. Consistent with their failure to differentiate, Tlk1-KD cells failed to downregulate the expression of undifferentiated cell markers including Oct4, Nanog, and Sox2 during differentiation, suggesting a negative role of Tlk1. Interestingly, Tlk1 overexpression sufficiently downregulated the expression of core pluripotency factors possibly irrespective of its kinase activity, thereby leading to a partial loss of self-renewal ability even in an undifferentiated state. Moreover, Tlk1 overexpression caused severe growth defects and G2/M phase arrest as well as apoptosis. Collectively, our data suggest that Tlk1 negatively regulates the expression of pluripotency factors, thereby contributing to the scheduled differentiation of mouse ESCs.","['Lee, Jina', 'Kim, Min Seong', 'Park, Su Hyung', 'Jang, Yeun Kyu']","['Lee J', 'Kim MS', 'Park SH', 'Jang YK']","['Department of Systems Biology, College of Life Science and Biotechnology, Yonsei University, Seoul, 03722, Republic of Korea.', 'Initiative for Biological Function and Systems, Yonsei University, Seoul, 03722, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Systems Biology, College of Life Science and Biotechnology, Yonsei University, Seoul, 03722, Republic of Korea.', 'Initiative for Biological Function and Systems, Yonsei University, Seoul, 03722, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Systems Biology, College of Life Science and Biotechnology, Yonsei University, Seoul, 03722, Republic of Korea.', 'Initiative for Biological Function and Systems, Yonsei University, Seoul, 03722, Republic of Korea.', 'Center for Genomic Integrity, Institute for Basic Science, Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology, UNIST-gil 50, Ulsan, 689-798, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Systems Biology, College of Life Science and Biotechnology, Yonsei University, Seoul, 03722, Republic of Korea. ykjang@yonsei.ac.kr.', 'Initiative for Biological Function and Systems, Yonsei University, Seoul, 03722, Republic of Korea. ykjang@yonsei.ac.kr.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180110,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,PMC5762884,,,2018/01/13 06:00,2018/11/18 06:00,['2018/01/12 06:00'],"['2017/09/07 00:00 [received]', '2017/12/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/11/18 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-017-18628-9 [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-017-18628-9 [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2018 Jan 10;8(1):334. doi: 10.1038/s41598-017-18628-9.,20181116,1,"['0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Tlk1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Cycle/genetics', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Ectopic Gene Expression', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/cytology/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Knockout Techniques', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1342-4190'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several innate immune signaling pathways have been implicated in the detection of blood-stage Plasmodium parasites, yet their influence over Th cell immunity remains unclear. In this study, we used Plasmodium-reactive TCR transgenic CD4(+) T cells, termed PbTII cells, during nonlethal P. chabaudi chabaudi AS and P. yoelii 17XNL infection in mice, to examine Th cell development in vivo. We found no role for caspase1/11, stimulator of IFN genes, or mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein, and only modest roles for MyD88 and TRIF-dependent signaling in controlling PbTII cell expansion. In contrast, IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) was important for supporting PbTII expansion, promoting Th1 over T follicular helper (Tfh) differentiation, and controlling parasites during the first week of infection. IRF3 was not required for early priming by conventional dendritic cells, but was essential for promoting CXCL9 and MHC class II expression by inflammatory monocytes that supported PbTII responses in the spleen. Thereafter, IRF3-deficiency boosted Tfh responses, germinal center B cell and memory B cell development, parasite-specific Ab production, and resolution of infection.

Besides T cells, NK cells are a second cytotoxic lymphocyte subset that contributes to antitumor immunity, particularly in leukemia. Accordingly, these cells are being clinically evaluated for cancer treatment through multiple approaches, such as adoptive transfer of ex vivo expanded polyclonal NK cells (pNKC). Here, we analyzed whether and how OX40 and its ligand (OX40L) influence NK-cell function and antileukemia reactivity. We report that OX40 is expressed on leukemic blasts in a substantial percentage of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and that OX40 can, after stimulation with agonistic OX40 antibodies, mediate proliferation and release of cytokines that act as growth and survival factors for the leukemic cells. We also demonstrate that pNKC differentially express OX40L, depending on the protocol used for their generation. OX40L signaling promoted NK-cell activation, cytokine production, and cytotoxicity, and disruption of OX40-OX40L interaction impaired pNKC reactivity against primary AML cells. Together, our data implicate OX40/OX40L in disease pathophysiology of AML and in NK-cell immunosurveillance. Our findings indicate that effects of the OX40-OX40L receptor-ligand system in other immune cell subsets and also malignant cells should be taken into account when developing OX40-targeted approaches for cancer immunotherapy.

In this study, we suggest a novel strategy based on blocking protein neddylation to address BCR-ABL point mutations and leukemia stem cells (LSC) that lie at the root of imatinib-resistant recurrences. On the basis of the finding that the NEDD8-activating enzyme subunit NAE1 is overexpressed in CML cells, we hypothesized that the function of certain neddylation-dependent protein substrates might be targeted to therapeutic ends in imatinib-resistant CML cells and LSCs. In support of this hypothesis, we demonstrated that the NAE1 inhibitor MLN4924 induced G2-M-phase arrest and apoptosis in bulk CML cells with wild-type p53, regardless of their T315I mutation status in BCR-ABL. Moreover, MLN4924 inhibited the survival and self-renewal of primary human CML CD34(+) cells and LSCs in CML-bearing mice via accumulation of p27(kip1) in the nucleus. Notably, p27(kip1) silencing attenuated the suppressive effect of MLN4924 on the maintenance of LSCs in CML-bearing mice. Taken together, our findings offer a preclinical proof of concept for targeting protein neddylation as a novel therapeutic strategy to override mutational and LSC-derived imatinib resistance in CML.Significance: These findings highlight a mediator of protein neddylation, a type of protein turnover mechanism, as a viable therapeutic target against imatinib-resistant forms of chronic myelogenous leukemia.

Discovering Hidden Coexisting Hematological Neoplasms: A Single Institutional Review of 100 Collision Tumors.,296-305,10.1177/1066896917752862 [doi],"A collision tumor is defined as two histologically distinct tumor types identified at the same anatomic site. Hematolymphoid proliferative disorders (HLPDs), which coincide with non-hematological neoplasms, can mimic an immune response and can easily be overlooked as an immune reaction to a solid organ neoplasm, especially when low grade. In order to avoid a delay in the diagnosis of a HLPD during the workup for a non-hematological neoplasm, we identified a cohort of 100 cases with a HLPD diagnosis during the initial workup and treatment of a non-hematological neoplasm, or vice versa. Among the 100 collision tumors, the most common non-hematological neoplasms associated with a HLPD were from the colon (17%), breast (15%), and prostate (12%). The most commonly identified HLPDs were chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL; 18%), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (17%), follicular lymphoma (14%), marginal zone lymphoma (10%), acute myeloid leukemia (8%), and classical Hodgkin lymphoma (5%). Interestingly, in this cohort 5% of the low-grade HLPDs, all of them CLL/SLL, were missed at initial sign-out and subsequently required an addendum report. The other 95% of cases were reviewed or signed out by a hematopathologist before the report was finalized for the non-hematological neoplasm. In summary, high-grade hematological malignancies are less likely to be missed; however, low-grade coexisting HLPDs can be overlooked as a reactive immune response to a solid organ neoplasm. Therefore, it is important to keep in mind the existence of collision low-grade HLPDs before assuming the lymphoid infiltrates as an immunological response.","['Himchak, Evan', 'Marks, Etan', 'Shi, Yang', 'Wang, Yanhua']","['Himchak E', 'Marks E', 'Shi Y', 'Wang Y']","['1 Montefiore Medical Center/Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY, USA.', '1 Montefiore Medical Center/Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY, USA.', '1 Montefiore Medical Center/Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY, USA.', '1 Montefiore Medical Center/Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20180110,United States,Int J Surg Pathol,International journal of surgical pathology,9314927,,['NOTNLM'],"['carcinoma', 'collision tumor', 'leukemia', 'lymphoma', 'sarcoma']",2018/01/13 06:00,2018/09/28 06:00,['2018/01/12 06:00'],"['2018/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/09/28 06:00 [medline]', '2018/01/12 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/1066896917752862 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Surg Pathol. 2018 Jun;26(4):296-305. doi: 10.1177/1066896917752862.

Autologous T cells, reprogrammed to target malignant cells via the expression of a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) represent the frontrunner in this approach. Tremendous clinical regressions have been achieved using CAR-T cells against a variety of cancers both in numerous preclinical studies and in several clinical trials, most notably against acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and resulted in a very recent United States Food and Drug Administration approval of the first CAR-T-cell therapy. In most studies CARs are transferred to conventional alphabetaT cells. Nevertheless, transferring a CAR into different cell types, such as gammadeltaT cells, natural killer cells, natural killer T cells, and myeloid cells has yet received relatively little attention, although these cell types possess unique features that may aid in surmounting some of the hurdles CAR-T-cell therapy currently faces. This review focuses on CAR therapy using effectors beyond conventional alphabetaT cells and discusses those strategies against the backdrop of developing a safe, powerful, and durable cancer therapy.","['Harrer, Dennis C', 'Dorrie, Jan', 'Schaft, Niels']","['Harrer DC', 'Dorrie J', 'Schaft N']","['1 Department of Dermatology, Universitatsklinikum Erlangen and Faculty of Medicine, Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg , Erlangen, Germany .', '1 Department of Dermatology, Universitatsklinikum Erlangen and Faculty of Medicine, Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg , Erlangen, Germany .', '1 Department of Dermatology, Universitatsklinikum Erlangen and Faculty of Medicine, Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg , Erlangen, Germany .']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20180227,United States,Hum Gene Ther,Human gene therapy,9008950,,['NOTNLM'],"['*NK cell', '*NKT cell', '*adoptive T-cell therapy', '*chimeric antigen receptor', '*myeloid cell', '*gammadeltaT cell']",2018/01/13 06:00,2019/05/18 06:00,['2018/01/12 06:00'],"['2018/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/18 06:00 [medline]', '2018/01/12 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/hum.2017.236 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Gene Ther. 2018 May;29(5):547-558. doi: 10.1089/hum.2017.236.

However, any potential role for NF-kappaB non-canonical signaling in AML has been largely overlooked. Here, we report that stabilization of NF-kappaB-inducing kinase (NIK) suppresses AML. Mechanistically, stabilization of NIK activates NF-kappaB non-canonical signaling and represses NF-kappaB canonical signaling. In addition, stabilization of NIK-induced activation of NF-kappaB non-canonical signaling upregulates Dnmt3a and downregulates Mef2c, which suppresses and promotes AML development, respectively. Importantly, by querying the connectivity MAP using up- and downregulated genes that are present exclusively in NIK-stabilized LSCs, we discovered that verteporfin has anti-AML effects, suggesting that repurposing verteporfin to target myeloid leukemia is worth testing clinically. Our data provide a scientific rationale for developing small molecules to stabilize NIK specifically in myeloid leukemias as an attractive therapeutic option.","['Xiu, Yan', 'Dong, Qianze', 'Li, Qingchang', 'Li, Fengyin', 'Borcherding, Nick', 'Zhang, Weizhou', 'Boyce, Brendan', 'Xue, Hai-Hui', 'Zhao, Chen']","['Xiu Y', 'Dong Q', 'Li Q', 'Li F', 'Borcherding N', 'Zhang W', 'Boyce B', 'Xue HH', 'Zhao C']","['Department of Pathology, Carver College of Medicine, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA 52242, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Carver College of Medicine, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA 52242, USA; Department of Pathology, China Medical University, 77 Puhe Rd., Shenbei Xinqu, Shenyang Shi, Liaoning Sheng 110122, China.', 'Department of Pathology, China Medical University, 77 Puhe Rd., Shenbei Xinqu, Shenyang Shi, Liaoning Sheng 110122, China.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Carver College of Medicine, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA 52242, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Carver College of Medicine, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA 52242, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Carver College of Medicine, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA 52242, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, NY 14642, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Carver College of Medicine, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA 52242, USA.

The effectiveness of treadmill training on activity among children and young people with cerebral palsy, Down syndrome or children and young people that have undergone hemospherectomy is uncertain. The effectiveness of aquatic programs on participation among children and young people with cerebral palsy is uncertain. The quality of the evidence is low or very low.

29319954,,Publisher,,,,2007 Feb,,,,"Objectives Metaanalysis of randomised controlled trials has shown that TNF-inhibitors are effective in RA. These trials however are undertaken in highly selective populations; under an experimental setting that may differ from that of clinical practice, and follow up rarely extend beyond 1 year. In addition all trials were sponsored by the manufacturer. We were asked to extend the review and meta-analysis of RCTs with a review of data from registries to evaluate efficacy and safety of TNF-inhibitors when used in clinical practice (real world). We focused particularly on the following questions: What is the efficacy of TNF-inhibitors when used outside clinical trials? What is the efficacy of TNF-inhibitors after long term use? What adverse events are reported in these studies? What is the risk of malignancies following long term use? What are the experiences concerning use of medication, treatment compliance and change of medication? Methods We searched Medline and Embase June 2006 by combining search terms for registries, cohort studies and databases with terms for TNF-inhibitors and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We included publications from registries or databases on adalimumab, etanercept and infliximab for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis or juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Manufacturers were also invited to submit data. Outcomes considered were efficacy, safety and medication use. Results The search gave 290 hits, 64 references were retrieved and assessed in full text, and 23 publications finally included. These studies covered patients with RA, in addition we found one study on juvenile idiopathic arthritis. We did not identify relevant studies on ankylosing spondylitis or psoriatic arthritis. The summary of the results from the studies are as follows:Effectiveness: We included seven studies from registries and databases reporting clinical effects of TNF-inhibitors. In summary these studies showed that TNFinhibitors were effective also when used in clinical practice. The effect however appeared to be lower compared with RCTs. This could be explained by a more heterogeneous patient population. In addition patients in clinical practice often continued with existing medication, opposed to most clinical trials where patients often discontinued existing medications before enrolling. Although we aimed to 9 assess long-term effectiveness, few patients have been followed beyond 2-3 years of treatment. One study assessed patients with JIA, in this study treatment with TNF-inhibitor (etanercept) led to a significant reduction of the disease activity in most of the patients. Combination therapy: Two randomised controlled trials and data from registries evaluated the combination of TNF and MTX treatment. Treatment with TNFinhibitors and methotrexate (MTX) appeared more effective than treatment with TNFinhibitor alone in reducing the disease activity in patients with RA. Cancer: We included six publications that assessed cancer risk following TNFtreatment. A general comments to these studies is that patients have not been followed sufficiently long to allow for conclusions regarding cancer risk. Four studies analysed risk of lymphoma or leukaemia, with inconsistent results. Two studies analysed risk of solid cancer, with inconcistent results. Experiences from transplantation patients shows that cancer usually develops 10-15 years after immunosuppressive medication. Hence, these studies does not give any further information about the risk of developing cancer following treatment with TNF-inhibitors than reported in the randomized controlled trials. Infections: Treatment with TNF-inhibitors were associated with increase the risk of infections. In particular, the risk of reactivation of latent tuberculosis. However, routine screening and treatment of tuberculosis prior to TNF-treatment have reduced this risk considerably. Compliance: Continuation of treatment with TNF-inhibitors (etanercept og infliximab) after one year was between 62-73 %. This number is lower than compared with RCTs . The reasons for ceasing TNF-treatment were in most cases adverse events or lack of effect. However, it was found that the compliance to TNF-inhibitors was higher then for traditional DMARDs. Conclusion: In conclusion, results from clinical trials and registries show that TNF-inhibitors are effective, also when used on a broader patient population outside the setting of clinical trials. Treatment with TNF-inhibitors is associated with increased risk of infections, in particular tuberculosis. Included studies does not allow for conclusion regarding risk of cancer. Thus, the issue of long term safety is at time being incomplete, with a follow up of 2-3 years in most studies. A national registry for treatment with TNF-inhibitors (and other biologics) in Norway would be a very helpful tool to identify the effect and adverse events after longtreatment with TNF-inhibitors.","['Arentz-Hansen, Helene', 'Palm, Oyvind', 'Natvig Norderhaug, Inger', 'Klemp Gjertsen, Marianne', 'Nordvag, Bjorn-Yngvar']","['Arentz-Hansen H', 'Palm O', 'Natvig Norderhaug I', 'Klemp Gjertsen M', 'Nordvag BY']",,['eng'],,"['Review', 'Book']",,"Oslo, Norway",,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Tumor Necrosis Factors', 'Rheumatic Diseases', 'Technology Assessment, Biomedical']",2018/01/11 06:01,2018/01/11 06:01,,,['NBK464738 [bookaccession]'],,,,,,,,,['Copyright (c)2007 by The Norwegian Institute of Public Health (NIPH).'],,,,,,,,,20180111,['9788281211520'],"['Knowledge Centre for the Health Services at The Norwegian Institute of Public', 'Health (NIPH)']",['NIPH Systematic Reviews: Executive Summaries'],"['Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) Inhibitors for Rheumatic Diseases (Part 2): A', 'Systematic Review of Data From Registries and Safety Databases']",['2018/01/11 06:01'],,,,,

We described the etiology, clinical picture and outcome of new-onset neutropenia in immunocompetent children assessed in the emergency department and hospitalized at our medical center. METHODS: Previously healthy children admitted with neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count <1.5 x 10(9)/L) were included. Serious bacterial infections were defined as culture-positive blood, urine, cerebrospinal fluid, articular fluid or stool infections, pneumonia, Brucellosis and Rickettsiosis. RESULTS: A total of 601 patients (5 days-202 months old) were enrolled; 3 (0.5%), 48 (8%), 165 (27.5%) and 385 (64%) had absolute neutrophil counts <0.2, 0.2-0.5, 0.5-1.0 and 1.0-1.5 x 10(9)/L, respectively. Associated leukopenia and thrombocytopenia were diagnosed in 186 (39%) and 71 (11.8%) patients. Three hundred sixteen of 601 (52.6%) and 519 of 601 (86.4%) were <2 or 36 months of age, respectively. Fever at admission was present in 27.6% patients. Serious bacterial infections were diagnosed in 106 (17.6%) patients. Brucellosis and rickettsiosis were diagnosed in 8 of 52 (15.4%) and 9 of 39 (23.1%) tests obtained. Respiratory syncytial virus was diagnosed in 17 of 33 (51.5%) nasal washes. An infectious etiology was determined in 171 (28.5%) patients. Acute leukemia was diagnosed in 6 patients. A significant correlation was found between resolution of neutropenia and patient age, infectious etiology and severity of neutropenia. CONCLUSIONS: (1) Severe neutropenia was rare; (2) More than half of patients were <2 months of age; (3) An infectious etiology was diagnosed in a high number of patients, and serious bacterial infections were frequent and (4) Brucella spp. and rickettsial infections were frequent etiologies associated with neutropenia in our setting.","['David, Odeya', 'Fruchtman, Yariv', 'Sergienko, Ruslan', 'Kapelushnik, Joseph', 'Leibovitz, Eugene']","['David O', 'Fruchtman Y', 'Sergienko R', 'Kapelushnik J', 'Leibovitz E']","['From the Pediatric Hematology/Oncology Department.', 'Soroka University Medical Center, Beer-Sheva, Israel.', 'Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer-Sheva, Israel.', 'From the Pediatric Hematology/Oncology Department.', 'Soroka University Medical Center, Beer-Sheva, Israel.', 'Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer-Sheva, Israel.', 'Public Health Department.', 'Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer-Sheva, Israel.', 'From the Pediatric Hematology/Oncology Department.', 'Soroka University Medical Center, Beer-Sheva, Israel.', 'Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer-Sheva, Israel.', 'Pediatric Infectious Disease Unit, Soroka University Medical Center, Beer-Sheva, Israel.', 'Soroka University Medical Center, Beer-Sheva, Israel.', 'Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer-Sheva, Israel.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Pediatr Infect Dis J,The Pediatric infectious disease journal,8701858,,,,2018/01/11 06:00,2019/04/05 06:00,['2018/01/11 06:00'],"['2018/01/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/05 06:00 [medline]', '2018/01/11 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/INF.0000000000001893 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Infect Dis J. 2018 Jun;37(6):570-575. doi: 10.1097/INF.0000000000001893.,20190404,6,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Bacterial Infections/complications/*diagnosis', 'Brucellosis/diagnosis', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Emergency Service, Hospital/statistics & numerical data', 'Female', 'Fever/etiology', 'Hospitalization/*statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', '*Immunocompetence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Neutropenia/complications/*etiology/microbiology', 'Pneumonia/complications', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Rickettsia Infections/diagnosis']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated whether uniform antibacterial guidelines, including mandatory antibacterial prophylaxis in afebrile patients during induction, decreases the incidence of microbiologically documented bacteremia. METHODS: Between 2012 and 2015, 230 patients with newly diagnosed ALL (aged 1-21) were enrolled on Dana-Farber Cancer Institute ALL Consortium Protocol 11-001 (DFCI 11-001). Induction therapy, regardless of risk group, included vincristine, prednisone, doxorubicin, methotrexate, and PEG-asparaginase. Afebrile patients received fluoroquinolone prophylaxis at the initiation of induction and those presenting with fever received broad-spectrum antibiotics; antibiotics were continued until blood count recovery. Rates of documented bacteremias and fungal infections on DFCI 11-001 were compared to those on the predecessor protocol (DFCI 05-001), which included the same induction phase without antibiotic prophylaxis guidelines. RESULTS: Sixty-six (28.7%) patients received fluoroquinolone prophylaxis, the remaining patients received broad-spectrum antibiotics. Twenty-four (36.4%) patients on prophylaxis developed fever and seven (10.6%) developed bacteremia. The overall rate of infection during induction on DFCI 11-001 was lower than on DFCl 05-001 (14.3% vs. 26.3%, P < 0.0001) due to a decreased rate of bacteremia (10.9% vs. 24.4%, P < 0.0001).

Genomic instability, including mutations in DNA sequences, chromosomal aneuploidy, translocations and gene amplifications contribute to the development and progression of AML. Prior DNA damaging agent exposure enhances the risk of developing AML, as does inheritance of genetic syndromes that involve alterations in DNA repair pathways. Furthermore, these same variations are associated with sensitivity and resistance to a range of chemotherapeutics. Taken together, these studies suggest that defects within DNA repair pathways are involved in the pathogenesis and prognosis of AML. OBJECTIVE: This review summarises the major DNA repair pathways, and presents an overview of current data on DNA damage repair abnormalities in AML as they pertain to the development of resistance and sensitivity to chemotherapeutics in AML. Additionally, the use of drugs that modulate these pathways as new treatments for AML will be explored herein. CONCLUSION: This review highlights that abnormalities in DNA repair mechanisms in AML cells are potential novel treatment targets for AML patients with disease that is resistant to current therapies.","['Pearsall, Elizabeth A', 'Lincz, Lisa F', 'Skelding, Kathryn A']","['Pearsall EA', 'Lincz LF', 'Skelding KA']","['School of Biomedical Sciences and Pharmacy, Faculty of Health and Medicine, The University of Newcastle, Callaghan, New South Wales, Australia.', 'Priority Research Centre for Cancer Research Innovation and Translation, Hunter Medical Research Institute, Faculty of Health, The University of Newcastle, Callaghan, New South Wales, Australia.', 'School of Biomedical Sciences and Pharmacy, Faculty of Health and Medicine, The University of Newcastle, Callaghan, New South Wales, Australia.', 'Priority Research Centre for Cancer Research Innovation and Translation, Hunter Medical Research Institute, Faculty of Health, The University of Newcastle, Callaghan, New South Wales, Australia.', 'Hunter Haematology Research Group, Calvary Mater Newcastle Hospital, Waratah, New South Wales, Australia.', 'School of Biomedical Sciences and Pharmacy, Faculty of Health and Medicine, The University of Newcastle, Callaghan, New South Wales, Australia.', 'Priority Research Centre for Cancer Research Innovation and Translation, Hunter Medical Research Institute, Faculty of Health, The University of Newcastle, Callaghan, New South Wales, Australia.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United Arab Emirates,Curr Drug Targets,Current drug targets,100960531,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myeloid leukaemia', '*DNA repair', '*base excision repair.', '*chemosensitivity', '*direct enzymatic repair', '*homologous recombination', '*non-homologous end joining', '*nucleotide excision repair']",2018/01/11 06:00,2019/10/11 06:00,['2018/01/11 06:00'],"['2017/06/02 00:00 [received]', '2017/10/04 00:00 [revised]', '2017/12/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/11 06:00 [medline]', '2018/01/11 06:00 [entrez]']","['CDT-EPUB-87795 [pii]', '10.2174/1389450119666180110093713 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Drug Targets. 2018;19(10):1205-1219. doi: 10.2174/1389450119666180110093713.,20191009,10,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', '*DNA Damage', 'DNA Repair/*drug effects/genetics', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Treatment Outcome']",,"['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.org.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, relatively little is known about the application of minimal residual disease (MRD) detection with this treatment. To address this, we studied 142 adults with ALL treated with hyperCVAD over a 10-year period who had MRD assessed by either multi-parameter flow cytometry or (for patients with Philadelphia chromosome positive ALL) reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction for the BCR-ABL1 translocation. In a multivariate analysis, patients who achieved MRD negativity (MRD(Neg) ) at any point had significantly better overall survival (OS; hazard ratio [HR] 0.43; P = .01) and event-free survival (EFS; HR 0.27; P < .01). Of 121 patients with MRD assessed at various points within 90 days of starting hyperCVAD, 50% (n = 61) had achieved MRD(Neg) . Among those that became MRD(Neg) , the median time to MRD(Neg) was 68 days. Time to MRD(Neg) was significantly associated with EFS (P = .009), but not OS (P = .19), implying increasingly better EFS the earlier MRD(Neg) is achieved. These data add to our understanding of MRD assessment during treatment with hyperCVAD, aide clinicians with predicting relapse risk, and provide additional historical data on which future clinical trials can be designed.","['Cassaday, Ryan D', 'Stevenson, Philip A', 'Wood, Brent L', 'Becker, Pamela S', 'Hendrie, Paul C', 'Sandmaier, Brenda M', 'Radich, Jerald L', 'Shustov, Andrei R']","['Cassaday RD', 'Stevenson PA', 'Wood BL', 'Becker PS', 'Hendrie PC', 'Sandmaier BM', 'Radich JL', 'Shustov AR']","['Department of Medicine, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, Washington.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington.', 'Clinical Statistics Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, Washington.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, Washington.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, Washington.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, Washington.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, Washington.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, Washington.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180127,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,,,,2018/01/11 06:00,2019/05/06 06:00,['2018/01/11 06:00'],"['2017/12/27 00:00 [received]', '2018/01/01 00:00 [revised]', '2018/01/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/06 06:00 [medline]', '2018/01/11 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.25030 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2018 Aug;93(4):546-552. doi: 10.1002/ajh.25030.

However, despite the high efficacy and favourable toxicity profile of ibrutinib, recent data suggest that it is not always administered optimally in clinical practice, with an increased tendency for dose reduction and a higher frequency of discontinuation. An expert panel of European haematologists was convened to identify practical issues pertinent to physicians involved in the therapeutic management of ibrutinib-treated CLL patients and here we outline the findings. Practical management recommendations are given for treating patients with ibrutinib and clinical considerations for the management of adverse events (AEs) that can be associated with ibrutinib treatment are addressed. This article highlights that patients should be monitored for treatment emergent adverse events, most of which are mild, transient and generally occur early in therapy and that, even with more challenging AEs, patients can often be maintained on therapy with minimal disruption through careful management. The necessity to use the correct ibrutinib dose, along with increased awareness, vigilance, mitigation and management of AEs, are all recommended to maximise outcomes for CLL patients treated with ibrutinib.","['Gribben, John G', 'Bosch, Francesc', 'Cymbalista, Florence', 'Geisler, Christian H', 'Ghia, Paolo', 'Hillmen, Peter', 'Moreno, Carol', 'Stilgenbauer, Stephan']","['Gribben JG', 'Bosch F', 'Cymbalista F', 'Geisler CH', 'Ghia P', 'Hillmen P', 'Moreno C', 'Stilgenbauer S']","['Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London, London, UK.', ""Department of Haematology, Vall d'Hebron University Hospital, Barcelona, Spain."", 'U978 Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale, Bobigny, France.', 'Labex Inflamex, Universite Paris 13, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Bobigny, France.', 'Hopital Avicenne, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Bobigny, France.', 'Department of Haematology, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Strategic Research Programme on CLL, IRCCS San Raffaele Hospital, Milan, Italy.', 'Universita Vita-Salute San Raffaele, Milan, Italy.', ""St James' Institute of Oncology, University of Leeds, Leeds, UK."", 'Department of Haematology, Hospital de la Santa Creu Sant Pau, Autonomous University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20180109,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,['NOTNLM'],"['*European recommendations', '*anticoagulation', '*bleeding', '*chronic lymphocytic leukaemia', '*ibrutinib']",2018/01/11 06:00,2019/01/03 06:00,['2018/01/11 06:00'],"['2017/09/14 00:00 [received]', '2017/10/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/03 06:00 [medline]', '2018/01/11 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/bjh.15080 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2018 Mar;180(5):666-679. doi: 10.1111/bjh.15080.

The immune responsiveness of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) was first demonstrated by allogeneic stem cell transplantation. In addition, milder immunotherapeutic approaches are exploited. However, the long-term efficacy of these therapies is hampered by various immune resistance and editing mechanisms. In this regard, co-inhibitory signalling pathways have been shown to play a crucial role. Via up-regulation of inhibitory checkpoints, tumour-reactive T cell and Natural Killer cell responses can be strongly impeded. Accordingly, the introduction of checkpoint inhibitors targeting CTLA-4 (CTLA4) and PD-1 (PDCD1, CD279)/PD-L1 (CD274, PDCD1LG1) accomplished a breakthrough in cancer treatment, with impressive clinical responses. Numerous new co-inhibitory players and novel combination therapies are currently investigated for their potential to boost anti-tumour immunity and improve survival of cancer patients. Although the challenge here remains to avoid severe systemic toxicity. This review addresses the involvement of co-inhibitory signalling in AML immune evasion and discusses the opportunities for checkpoint blockers in AML treatment.","['Hobo, Willemijn', 'Hutten, Tim J A', 'Schaap, Nicolaas P M', 'Dolstra, Harry']","['Hobo W', 'Hutten TJA', 'Schaap NPM', 'Dolstra H']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine - Laboratory of Haematology, Radboud University Medical Centre, Nijmegen, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine - Laboratory of Haematology, Radboud University Medical Centre, Nijmegen, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Haematology, Radboud University Medical Centre, Nijmegen, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine - Laboratory of Haematology, Radboud University Medical Centre, Nijmegen, the Netherlands.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20180109,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,['NOTNLM'],"['*acute myeloid leukaemia', '*anti-tumour immunity', '*checkpoint molecules', '*haematological malignancies']",2018/01/11 06:00,2019/02/06 06:00,['2018/01/11 06:00'],"['2018/01/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/02/06 06:00 [medline]', '2018/01/11 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/bjh.15078 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2018 Apr;181(1):38-53. doi: 10.1111/bjh.15078.

While the most potent treatment modality for patients who achieve a complete remission after relapse is still allogeneic haematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT), both transplant-related mortality and relapse rates are high and many patients are not candidates for this approach. After a few decades of relative stasis in this field, a large number of novel approaches have become available to tackle this highly fatal disease. This is mostly due to our improved understanding of disease pathogenesis (including targetable mutations) and the anti-leukaemia potential of the immune system. Several small-molecule inhibitors and immunotherapeutic options are being explored in clinical trials and many more are in pre-clinical phase. Future studies will focus on novel and mechanistically driven combinations, sequential treatments, and low-toxicity maintenance strategies. While cure of relapsed/refractory AML without allo-HCT is currently unlikely, treatments are becoming less toxic and remissions are lasting longer.","['Rashidi, Armin', 'Weisdorf, Daniel J', 'Bejanyan, Nelli']","['Rashidi A', 'Weisdorf DJ', 'Bejanyan N']","['Division of Hematology, Oncology, and Transplantation, Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Oncology, and Transplantation, Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Oncology, and Transplantation, Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20180109,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,['NOTNLM'],"['* FLT3', '*Immunotherapy', '*acute myeloid leukaemia', '*chemotherapy', '*stem cell transplantation']",2018/01/11 06:00,2019/02/06 06:00,['2018/01/11 06:00'],"['2018/01/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/02/06 06:00 [medline]', '2018/01/11 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/bjh.15077 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2018 Apr;181(1):27-37. doi: 10.1111/bjh.15077.

This is the first reported case of MCL with a (9;22) translocation. Case Report: An 80-year-old female presented with pancytopenia and was diagnosed with MDS. Over time, she required hospitalizations for platelet transfusions with increased frequency. She developed fatigue and weakness along with gastrointestinal symptoms. On exam, she had diffuse abdominal tenderness and a maculopapular rash. Her lab results revealed a new basophilia. A bone marrow biopsy showed 100% cellularity with many aggregates of mast cells. Chromosomal analysis showed t(9;22) with confirmed BCR/ABL1 fusion by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Discussion: MCL has a poor prognosis due to the aggressive nature of the disease and ineffective therapies. Translocation (9;22) is known to be associated with MDS transformations to acute leukemia; however, this translocation has never been reported in MCL. Further research on the relationship between t(9;22) and MCL could lead to development of improved therapeutic options.","['Lago, Kathryn J', 'Shupe, Matthew P', 'Hannah, William N', 'Velagaleti, Gopalrao V N', 'Mendiola, Christina', 'Ortega, Veronica', 'Haney, Brian R']","['Lago KJ', 'Shupe MP', 'Hannah WN', 'Velagaleti GVN', 'Mendiola C', 'Ortega V', 'Haney BR']","['Internal Medicine Service, San Antonio Military Medical Center, Fort Sam Houston, San Antonio, TX, USA.', 'Hematology and Oncology Service, San Antonio Military Medical Center, Fort Sam Houston, San Antonio, TX, USA.', 'Internal Medicine Service, San Antonio Military Medical Center, Fort Sam Houston, San Antonio, TX, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio, TX, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio, TX, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio, TX, USA.', 'Hematology and Oncology Service, San Antonio Military Medical Center, Fort Sam Houston, San Antonio, TX, USA.']",['eng'],,['Case Reports'],20171126,United States,Case Rep Oncol Med,Case reports in oncological medicine,101581035,PMC5727626,,,2018/01/11 06:00,2018/01/11 06:01,['2018/01/11 06:00'],"['2017/07/28 00:00 [received]', '2017/10/13 00:00 [revised]', '2017/10/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/01/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/11 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2017/9249302 [doi]'],ppublish,Case Rep Oncol Med. 2017;2017:9249302. doi: 10.1155/2017/9249302.

Methods: Diagnostic sensitivities of WITNESS and SNAP were determined through testing of 47 serum samples collected from cats day 56 post-experimental infection with a virulent FeLV Rickard strain. Successful experimental infection was confirmed based on observation of FeLV antigen and proviral DNA in anti-coagulated (EDTA) whole-blood samples by immunofluorescent antibody (IFA) test and PCR, respectively. Diagnostic specificities of both tests were determined through testing of sera of 92 laboratory-housed, non-FeLV-exposed specific pathogen-free (SPF) cats. Results: Forty-one of 47 blood samples were IFA positive, whereas all 47 samples were PCR positive. All 92 non-FeLV-infected SPF cats were IFA and PCR negative. In comparison to IFA as the reference method, both WITNESS and SNAP tests yielded equivalent sensitivities and specificities of 100% and 97.8%, respectively. In comparison to PCR as the reference method, both WITNESS and SNAP tests likewise performed equivalently, with sensitivities and specificities of 91.5% and 100%, respectively. Conclusions and relevance: Sensitivity and specificity of WITNESS FeLV-FIV for identifying FeLV p27 antigen in the sera of these experimentally FeLV-infected and non-FeLV-exposed SPF cats equaled those of the SNAP FIV/FeLV Combo Test. However, all positive results, regardless of the point-of-care test used, should be confirmed before making clinical decisions such as segregation from other cats or euthanasia.","['Krecic, Matthew R', 'Velineni, Sridhar', 'Meeus, Patrick', 'Fan, Huihao', 'Loenser, Michael']","['Krecic MR', 'Velineni S', 'Meeus P', 'Fan H', 'Loenser M']","['Zoetis, Parsippany, NJ, USA.', 'Zoetis, Kalamazoo, MI, USA.', 'Zoetis, Kalamazoo, MI, USA.', 'Zoetis, Kalamazoo, MI, USA.', 'Zoetis, Parsippany, NJ, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20180102,England,JFMS Open Rep,JFMS open reports,101672978,PMC5753920,,,2018/01/11 06:00,2018/01/11 06:01,['2018/01/11 06:00'],"['2018/01/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/01/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/11 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1177/2055116917748117 [doi]', '10.1177_2055116917748117 [pii]']",epublish,JFMS Open Rep. 2018 Jan 2;4(1):2055116917748117. doi: 10.1177/2055116917748117. eCollection 2018 Jan-Jun.,,1,,,,,,"['Conflict of interest: All authors are employed by Zoetis and WITNESS FeLV-FIV is', 'a product of the company with a business and/or financial interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite the use of prophylactic GVHD regimens, a significant proportion of transplant recipients will develop acute or chronic GVHD following HSCT. Corticosteroids are standard first-line therapy, but are only effective in roughly half of all cases with ~50% of patients going on to develop steroid-refractory disease, which increases the risk of nonrelapse mortality. While progress has been made with improvements in survival outcomes over time, corticosteroids are associated with significant toxicities, and many currently available salvage therapies are associated with increased immunosuppression, infectious complications, and potential loss of the graft versus leukemia (GVL) effect. Thus, there is an unmet need for development of newer treatment strategies for both acute and chronic GVHD to improve long-term post-transplant outcomes and quality of life for HSCT recipients. Here, we provide a concise review of major emerging therapies currently being studied in the treatment of acute and chronic GVHD.","['Hill, LaQuisa', 'Alousi, Amin', 'Kebriaei, Partow', 'Mehta, Rohtesh', 'Rezvani, Katayoun', 'Shpall, Elizabeth']","['Hill L', 'Alousi A', 'Kebriaei P', 'Mehta R', 'Rezvani K', 'Shpall E']","['Center for Cell and Gene Therapy, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Boulevard, Unit 0423, Houston, TX 77030-4000, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20171128,England,Ther Adv Hematol,Therapeutic advances in hematology,101549589,PMC5753923,['NOTNLM'],"['GVHD', 'acute graft versus host disease', 'allogeneic stem-cell transplantation', 'chronic graft versus host disease']",2018/01/11 06:00,2018/01/11 06:01,['2018/01/11 06:00'],"['2017/07/20 00:00 [received]', '2017/10/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/01/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/11 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1177/2040620717741860 [doi]', '10.1177_2040620717741860 [pii]']",ppublish,Ther Adv Hematol. 2018 Jan;9(1):21-46. doi: 10.1177/2040620717741860.

This signaling is required for B-cell survival, proliferation and interaction with the microenvironment. Ibrutinib proved active in preclinical models of lymphoproliferative diseases and achieved impressive response rates in heavily pretreated relapsed and refractory (R/R) patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Ibrutinib prolonged survival compared to standard therapy and mitigated the effect of most poor prognostic factors in CLL, thus becoming the main therapeutic option in high-risk populations. Moreover, compared with standard chemoimmunotherapy (CIT) for adults, ibrutinib causes fewer cytopenias and infections, while having its own unique toxicity profile. Its efficacy in relapsed patients as well as its tolerability have led to its increased use in previously untreated patients, especially in those with poor prognostic markers and/or the elderly. This review elaborates on ibrutinib's unique toxicity profile and the mechanisms of acquired resistance leading to progression on ibrutinib, since both are critical for understanding the obstacles to its first-line use. We will further evaluate the data from ongoing clinical trials in this setting and explore future options for combination therapy.","['Itchaki, Gilad', 'Brown, Jennifer R']","['Itchaki G', 'Brown JR']","['Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02215, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20171128,England,Ther Adv Hematol,Therapeutic advances in hematology,101549589,PMC5753924,['NOTNLM'],"['chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'first-line', 'ibrutinib']",2018/01/11 06:00,2018/01/11 06:01,['2018/01/11 06:00'],"['2017/08/06 00:00 [received]', '2017/10/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/01/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/11 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1177/2040620717741861 [doi]', '10.1177_2040620717741861 [pii]']",ppublish,Ther Adv Hematol. 2018 Jan;9(1):3-19. doi: 10.1177/2040620717741861.

MYB-driven transcriptional coactivation with CREB-binding protein (CBP)/P300 is required for acute lymphoblastic and myeloid leukemias, including refractory MLL-rearranged leukemias. Using structure-guided molecular design, we developed a peptidomimetic inhibitor MYBMIM that interferes with the assembly of the molecular MYB:CBP/P300 complex and rapidly accumulates in the nuclei of AML cells. Treatment of AML cells with MYBMIM led to the dissociation of the MYB:CBP/P300 complex in cells, its displacement from oncogenic enhancers enriched for MYB binding sites, and downregulation of MYB-dependent gene expression, including of MYC and BCL2 oncogenes. AML cells underwent mitochondrial apoptosis in response to MYBMIM, which was partially rescued by ectopic expression of BCL2. MYBMIM impeded leukemia growth and extended survival of immunodeficient mice engrafted with primary patient-derived MLL-rearranged leukemia cells. These findings elucidate the dependence of human AML on aberrant transcriptional coactivation, and establish a pharmacologic approach for its therapeutic blockade.","['Ramaswamy, Kavitha', 'Forbes, Lauren', 'Minuesa, Gerard', 'Gindin, Tatyana', 'Brown, Fiona', 'Kharas, Michael G', 'Krivtsov, Andrei V', 'Armstrong, Scott A', 'Still, Eric', 'de Stanchina, Elisa', 'Knoechel, Birgit', 'Koche, Richard', 'Kentsis, Alex']","['Ramaswamy K', 'Forbes L', 'Minuesa G', 'Gindin T', 'Brown F', 'Kharas MG', 'Krivtsov AV', 'Armstrong SA', 'Still E', 'de Stanchina E', 'Knoechel B', 'Koche R', 'Kentsis A']","['Molecular Pharmacology Program, Sloan Kettering Institute, New York, NY, 10065, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, 10065, NY, USA.', 'Molecular Pharmacology Program, Sloan Kettering Institute, New York, NY, 10065, USA.', 'Departments of Pediatrics, Pharmacology, and Physiology & Biophysics, Weill Cornell Medical College, Cornell University, New York, NY, 10065, USA.', 'Molecular Pharmacology Program, Sloan Kettering Institute, New York, NY, 10065, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Medical Center and New York Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY, 10065, USA.', 'Molecular Pharmacology Program, Sloan Kettering Institute, New York, NY, 10065, USA.', 'Molecular Pharmacology Program, Sloan Kettering Institute, New York, NY, 10065, USA.', 'Center for Epigenetics Research, Sloan Kettering Institute, New York, NY, 10065, USA.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, 02215, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, 10065, NY, USA.', 'Center for Epigenetics Research, Sloan Kettering Institute, New York, NY, 10065, USA.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, 02215, USA.', 'Molecular Pharmacology Program, Sloan Kettering Institute, New York, NY, 10065, USA.', 'Antitumor Assessment Core Facility, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, 10065, USA.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, 02215, USA.', 'Center for Epigenetics Research, Sloan Kettering Institute, New York, NY, 10065, USA.', 'Molecular Pharmacology Program, Sloan Kettering Institute, New York, NY, 10065, USA. kentsisresearchgroup@gmail.com.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, 10065, NY, USA. kentsisresearchgroup@gmail.com.', 'Departments of Pediatrics, Pharmacology, and Physiology & Biophysics, Weill Cornell Medical College, Cornell University, New York, NY, 10065, USA. kentsisresearchgroup@gmail.com.']",['eng'],"['U54 OD020355/OD/NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM073546/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA188881 /NH/NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA204396/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA176745 /NH/NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM073546 /NH/NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK101989 /NH/NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA008748 /NH/NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA188881/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA176745/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA204396 /NH/NIH HHS/United States', 'CA066996 /NH/NIH HHS/United States', 'K08 CA191091/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA193842 /NH/NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180109,England,Nat Commun,Nature communications,101528555,PMC5760651,,,2018/01/11 06:00,2018/12/12 06:00,['2018/01/11 06:00'],"['2017/06/01 00:00 [received]', '2017/12/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/01/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/12/12 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41467-017-02618-6 [doi]', '10.1038/s41467-017-02618-6 [pii]']",epublish,Nat Commun. 2018 Jan 9;9(1):110. doi: 10.1038/s41467-017-02618-6.,20181211,1,"['0 (Peptidomimetics)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb)', '114100-40-2 (Bcl2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (p300-CBP Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Binding Sites/physiology', 'Biomimetic Materials/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Female', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Molecular Dynamics Simulation', 'Peptidomimetics/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Transcriptional Activation/*genetics', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays/methods', 'p300-CBP Transcription Factors/biosynthesis/*genetics']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1165-6991', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8063-9191']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Biomarkers of CLL progression are required for optimising prognosis and therapy. The Inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase-isoform alpha (IBTKalpha) gene encodes a substrate receptor of Cullin 3-dependent E3 ubiquitin ligase, and promotes cell survival in response to the reticulum stress. Searching for novel markers of CLL progression, we analysed the expression of IBTKalpha in the peripheral blood B-cells of CLL patients, before and after first line therapy causing remission. The expression of IBTKalpha was significantly increased in disease progression, and decreased in remission after chemotherapy. Consistently with a pro-survival action, RNA interference of IBTKalpha increased the spontaneous and Fludarabine-induced apoptosis of MEC-1 CLL cells, and impaired the cell cycle of DeFew B-lymphoma cells by promoting the arrest in G0/G1 phase and apoptosis. Consistently, RNA interference of IBTKalpha up regulated the expression of pro-apoptotic genes, including TNF, CRADD, CASP7, BNIP3 and BIRC3. Our results indicate that IBTKalpha is a novel marker of CLL progression promoting cell growth and resistance to apoptosis. In this view, IBTKalpha may represent an attractive cancer drug target for counteracting the therapy-resistance of tumour cells.","['Albano, Francesco', 'Chiurazzi, Federico', 'Mimmi, Selena', 'Vecchio, Eleonora', 'Pastore, Arianna', 'Cimmino, Clementina', 'Frieri, Camilla', 'Iaccino, Enrico', 'Pisano, Antonio', 'Golino, Gaetanina', 'Fiume, Giuseppe', 'Mallardo, Massimo', 'Scala, Giuseppe', 'Quinto, Ileana']","['Albano F', 'Chiurazzi F', 'Mimmi S', 'Vecchio E', 'Pastore A', 'Cimmino C', 'Frieri C', 'Iaccino E', 'Pisano A', 'Golino G', 'Fiume G', 'Mallardo M', 'Scala G', 'Quinto I']","['Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, University ""Magna Graecia"" of Catanzaro, Catanzaro, Italy. albano@unicz.it.', 'Department of Clinical Medicine, University ""Federico II"" of Naples, Naples, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, University ""Magna Graecia"" of Catanzaro, Catanzaro, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, University ""Magna Graecia"" of Catanzaro, Catanzaro, Italy.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine and Medical Biotechnologies, University ""Federico II"" of Naples, Naples, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical Medicine, University ""Federico II"" of Naples, Naples, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical Medicine, University ""Federico II"" of Naples, Naples, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, University ""Magna Graecia"" of Catanzaro, Catanzaro, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, University ""Magna Graecia"" of Catanzaro, Catanzaro, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, University ""Magna Graecia"" of Catanzaro, Catanzaro, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, University ""Magna Graecia"" of Catanzaro, Catanzaro, Italy.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine and Medical Biotechnologies, University ""Federico II"" of Naples, Naples, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, University ""Magna Graecia"" of Catanzaro, Catanzaro, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, University ""Magna Graecia"" of Catanzaro, Catanzaro, Italy. quinto@unicz.it.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180109,England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,PMC5849039,,,2018/01/11 06:00,2019/05/01 06:00,['2018/01/11 06:00'],"['2017/08/01 00:00 [received]', '2017/10/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/09/22 00:00 [revised]', '2018/01/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/01/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/01 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41419-017-0026-3 [doi]', '10.1038/s41419-017-0026-3 [pii]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2018 Jan 9;9(1):13. doi: 10.1038/s41419-017-0026-3.,20190430,1,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BNIP3 protein, human)', '0 (CRADD Signaling Adaptor Protein)', '0 (CRADD protein, human)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (IBtk protein, human)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 7)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', '*Apoptosis/drug effects', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology/metabolism', 'CRADD Signaling Adaptor Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Carrier Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Caspase 7/genetics/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'G1 Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Up-Regulation', 'Vidarabine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/therapeutic use']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-6157-7688', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4001-3856']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we investigated thoroughly the effects of CK1delta/epsilon inhibition on the primary CLL cells and analyzed the therapeutic potential in vivo using 2 murine model systems based on the Emicro-TCL1-induced leukemia (syngeneic adoptive transfer model and spontaneous disease development), which resembles closely human CLL. We can demonstrate that the CK1delta/epsilon inhibitor PF-670462 significantly blocks microenvironmental interactions (chemotaxis, invasion and communication with stromal cells) in primary CLL cells in all major subtypes of CLL. In the mouse models, CK1 inhibition slows down accumulation of leukemic cells in the peripheral blood and spleen and prevents onset of anemia. As a consequence, PF-670462 treatment results in a significantly longer overall survival. Importantly, CK1 inhibition has synergistic effects to the B-cell receptor (BCR) inhibitors such as ibrutinib in vitro and significantly improves ibrutinib effects in vivo. Mice treated with a combination of PF-670462 and ibrutinib show the slowest progression of disease and survive significantly longer compared with ibrutinib-only treatment when the therapy is discontinued. In summary, this preclinical testing of CK1delta/epsilon inhibitor PF-670462 demonstrates that CK1 may serve as a novel therapeutic target in CLL, acting in synergy with BCR inhibitors. Our work provides evidence that targeting CK1 can represent an alternative or addition to the therapeutic strategies based on BCR signaling and antiapoptotic signaling (BCL-2) inhibition.","['Janovska, Pavlina', 'Verner, Jan', 'Kohoutek, Jiri', 'Bryjova, Lenka', 'Gregorova, Michaela', 'Dzimkova, Marta', 'Skabrahova, Hana', 'Radaszkiewicz, Tomasz', 'Ovesna, Petra', 'Vondalova Blanarova, Olga', 'Nemcova, Tereza', 'Hoferova, Zuzana', 'Vasickova, Katerina', 'Smyckova, Lucie', 'Egle, Alexander', 'Pavlova, Sarka', 'Poppova, Lucie', 'Plevova, Karla', 'Pospisilova, Sarka', 'Bryja, Vitezslav']","['Janovska P', 'Verner J', 'Kohoutek J', 'Bryjova L', 'Gregorova M', 'Dzimkova M', 'Skabrahova H', 'Radaszkiewicz T', 'Ovesna P', 'Vondalova Blanarova O', 'Nemcova T', 'Hoferova Z', 'Vasickova K', 'Smyckova L', 'Egle A', 'Pavlova S', 'Poppova L', 'Plevova K', 'Pospisilova S', 'Bryja V']","['Institute of Experimental Biology, Faculty of Science, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Biophysics, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Experimental Biology, Faculty of Science, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Center of Molecular Biology and Gene Therapy, Department of Internal Medicine-Hematology Oncology, University Hospital Brno and Medical Faculty, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Chemistry and Toxicology, Veterinary Research Institute, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Experimental Biology, Faculty of Science, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Experimental Biology, Faculty of Science, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Chemistry and Toxicology, Veterinary Research Institute, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Center of Molecular Biology and Gene Therapy, Department of Internal Medicine-Hematology Oncology, University Hospital Brno and Medical Faculty, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Experimental Biology, Faculty of Science, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Biostatistics and Analyses, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Experimental Biology, Faculty of Science, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Experimental Biology, Faculty of Science, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Biophysics, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, Brno, Czech Republic.', ""International Clinical Research Center, Center for Biomolecular and Cellular Engineering, St. Anne's University Hospital in Brno, Brno, Czech Republic."", 'Department of Histology and Embryology, Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Experimental Biology, Faculty of Science, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Paracelsus Medical University, Salzburg, Austria; and.', 'Center of Molecular Biology and Gene Therapy, Department of Internal Medicine-Hematology Oncology, University Hospital Brno and Medical Faculty, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Central European Institute of Technology (CEITEC), Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Center of Molecular Biology and Gene Therapy, Department of Internal Medicine-Hematology Oncology, University Hospital Brno and Medical Faculty, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Central European Institute of Technology (CEITEC), Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Center of Molecular Biology and Gene Therapy, Department of Internal Medicine-Hematology Oncology, University Hospital Brno and Medical Faculty, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Central European Institute of Technology (CEITEC), Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Center of Molecular Biology and Gene Therapy, Department of Internal Medicine-Hematology Oncology, University Hospital Brno and Medical Faculty, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Central European Institute of Technology (CEITEC), Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Experimental Biology, Faculty of Science, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Biophysics, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, Brno, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],['I 3282/FWF_/Austrian Science Fund FWF/Austria'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180109,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,,,2018/01/11 06:00,2019/03/20 06:00,['2018/01/11 06:00'],"['2017/05/25 00:00 [received]', '2018/01/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/20 06:00 [medline]', '2018/01/11 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)32400-9 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2017-05-786947 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2018 Mar 15;131(11):1206-1218. doi: 10.1182/blood-2017-05-786947.

Standard chemotherapies can induce complete remission in selected patients; however, a majority of patients eventually relapse and succumb to the disease. Thus, the development of novel therapeutics for AML is urgently needed. Human C-type lectin-like molecule-1 (CLL-1) is a type II transmembrane glycoprotein, and its expression is restricted to myeloid cells and the majority of AML blasts. Moreover, CLL-1 is expressed in leukemia stem cells (LSCs), but absent in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), which may provide a potential therapeutic target for AML treatment. METHODS: We tested the expression of CLL-1 antigen on peripheral blood cells and bone marrow cells in healthy donor and AML patients. Then, we developed a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) containing a CLL1-specific single-chain variable fragment, in combination with CD28, 4-1BB costimulatory domains, and CD3-zeta signaling domain. We further investigate the function of CLL-1 CAR-T cells. RESULTS: The CLL-1 CAR-T cells specifically lysed CLL-1(+) cell lines as well as primary AML patient samples in vitro. Strong anti-leukemic activity was observed in vivo by using a xenograft model of disseminated AML. Importantly, CLL-1(+) myeloid progenitor cells and mature myeloid cells were specifically eliminated by CLL-1 CAR-T cells, while normal HSCs were not targeted due to the lack of CLL-1 expression. CONCLUSIONS: CLL-1 CAR-T represents a promising immunotherapy for the treatment of AML.","['Wang, Jinghua', 'Chen, Siyu', 'Xiao, Wei', 'Li, Wende', 'Wang, Liang', 'Yang, Shuo', 'Wang, Weida', 'Xu,

Approximately 50% of all leukemia, lymphoma, colorectal- and breast cancer patients are affected. CIPN is induced by neurotoxic chemotherapeutic agents and can manifest with sensory and/or motor deficits. It is associated with significant disability and poor recovery. Common symptoms include pain, altered sensation, reduced or absent reflexes, muscle weakness, reduced balance control and insecure gait. These symptoms not only affect activities of daily living, subsequently reducing patients' quality of life, they have far more become a decisive limiting factor for medical therapy, causing treatment delays, dose reductions, or even discontinuation of therapy, which can affect the outcome and compromise survival. To date, CIPN cannot be prevented and its occurrence presents a diagnostic dilemma since approved and effective treatment options are lacking. Promising results have recently been achieved with exercise. We have revealed that sensorimotor training (SMT) or whole body vibration (WBV) can reduce the symptoms of CIPN and attenuate motor and sensory deficits. We furthermore detected a tendency that it may also have a preventive effect on the onset of CIPN. METHODS: We are therefore conducting a prospective, multicentre, controlled clinical trial involving 236 oncological patients receiving either oxaliplatin (N = 118) or vinca-alkaloid (N = 118) who are randomized to one of two interventions (SMT or WBV) or a treatment as usual (TAU) group. Primary endpoint is the time to incidence of neurologically confirmed CIPN. Secondary endpoints are pain, maintenance of the functionality of sensory as well as motor nerve fibres as well as the level of physical activity. The baseline assessment is performed prior to the first cycle of chemotherapy. Subsequent follow-up assessments are conducted at 12 weeks, after completion of chemotherapy, and at a 3-month follow-up. Patients who develop CIPN receive an additional assessment at this time point, as it represents the primary endpoint. DISCUSSION: We hypothesize that SMT and WBV prevent the onset or delay the progression of CIPN, decrease the likelihood of dose reductions or discontinuation of cancer treatment and improve patients' quality of life.

Several factors have been identified to explain the non-random occurrence of translocation breakpoints in the genome. These include chromatin density, gene density and CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF)/cohesin binding site density. However, such factors are at least partially interdependent. Using 13,844 and 1563 karyotypes from human blood and solid cancers, respectively, our multiple regression analysis only identified chromatin density as the primary statistically significant predictor. Specifically, translocation breakpoints preferentially occur in open chromatin. Also, blood and solid tumors show markedly distinct translocation signatures. Strikingly, translocation breakpoints occur significantly more frequently in acrocentric chromosomes than in non-acrocentric chromosomes. Thus, translocations are probably often generated around nucleoli in the inner nucleoplasm, away from the nuclear envelope. Importantly, our findings remain true both in multivariate analyses and after removal of highly recurrent translocations. Finally, we applied pairwise probabilistic co-occurrence modeling. In addition to well-known highly prevalent translocations, such as those resulting in BCR-ABL1 (BCR-ABL) and RUNX1-RUNX1T1 (AML1-ETO) fusion genes, we identified significantly underrepresented translocations with putative fusion genes, which are probably subject to strong negative selection during tumor evolution. Taken together, our findings provide novel insights into the generation and selection of translocations during cancer development.","['Lin, Cheng-Yu', 'Shukla, Ankit', 'Grady, John P', 'Fink, J Lynn', 'Dray, Eloise', 'Duijf, Pascal H G']","['Lin CY', 'Shukla A', 'Grady JP', 'Fink JL', 'Dray E', 'Duijf PHG']","['University of Queensland Diamantina Institute, The University of Queensland, Translational Research Institute, 37 Kent Street, Brisbane, QLD 4102, Australia. c.lin2@uq.edu.au.', 'University of Queensland Diamantina Institute, The University of Queensland, Translational Research Institute, 37 Kent Street, Brisbane, QLD 4102, Australia. ankit.shukla@uq.edu.au.', 'University of Queensland Diamantina Institute, The University of Queensland, Translational Research Institute, 37 Kent Street, Brisbane, QLD 4102, Australia. j.grady@garvan.org.au.', 'University of Queensland Diamantina Institute, The University of Queensland, Translational Research Institute, 37 Kent Street, Brisbane, QLD 4102, Australia. l.fink@uq.edu.au.', 'Institute of Health and Biomedical Innovation, Queensland University of Technology, Translational Research Institute, 37 Kent Street, Brisbane, QLD 4102, Australia. eloise.dray@qut.edu.au.', 'Mater Research Institute-The University of Queensland, Translational Research Institute, 37 Kent Street, Brisbane, QLD 4102, Australia. eloise.dray@qut.edu.au.', 'University of Queensland Diamantina Institute, The University of Queensland, Translational Research Institute, 37 Kent Street, Brisbane, QLD 4102, Australia. p.duijf@uq.edu.au.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20180108,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,PMC5789363,['NOTNLM'],"['CTCF', 'DNA double strand breaks', 'DNA repair', 'V(D)J recombination', 'acrocentric chromosomes', 'cohesin', 'leukemia', 'lymphoma', 'nucleolus', 'translocations']",2018/01/11 06:00,2018/01/11 06:01,['2018/01/11 06:00'],"['2017/10/27 00:00 [received]', '2017/12/11 00:00 [revised]', '2018/01/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/01/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/11 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers10010013 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers10010013 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2018 Jan 8;10(1). pii: cancers10010013. doi: 10.3390/cancers10010013.,,1,,,,['ORCID: 0000-0001-8646-9843'],,['The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The ethyl acetate (EtOAc) extract of Lobophytum crassum showed a distinctive chemical profile that was different from the wild type. It demonstrated significant anti-proliferative activity against Molt 4 leukemia cell with an IC50 value of 1 mug/mL after 24 h. Chemical investigation focusing on the unique peaks in L. crassum profile led to the discovery of a new alpha-tocopherol crassumtocopherol C (1), and two new cembrane-based diterpenoids culobophylins D (2) and E (3), along with ten known cembranoids (4-13). The structures of these isolates were elucidated using extensive spectroscopic techniques and a comparison with previously published data of related metabolites. Compound 2 was found to possess the first identified saturated internal C(4)-O-C14 linkage six-membered ring among all cembrane-type diterpenoids. The anti-proliferative activity of all the isolates (except 3) was evaluated against a limited panel of leukemia cell lines (Molt 4, K562, U937, and Sup-T1). The major compounds 8 and 10 exhibited the most anti-proliferative potent effect, with IC50 values ranging from 1.2 to 7.1 muM. The Structure Activity Relationship (SAR) of the isolates suggested that the presence of lactone moieties is crucial for the anti-proliferative activity against leukemia cells. Our work indicated that the development of an efficient aquaculture protocols for soft corals led to the discovery of new secondary metabolites with unique structural features. Such protocols can lead to a sustainable supply of biologically active compounds in enough quantities for the pharmaceutical industry.","['Peng, Bo-Rong', 'Lu, Mei-Chin', 'El-Shazly, Mohamed', 'Wu, Shwu-Li', 'Lai, Kuei-Hung', 'Su, Jui-Hsin']","['Peng BR', 'Lu MC', 'El-Shazly M', 'Wu SL', 'Lai KH', 'Su JH']","['Doctoral Degree Program in Marine Biotechnology, National Sun Yat-Sen University (NSYSU), 70 Lien-Hai Road, Kaohsiung 80424, Taiwan. pengpojung@gmail.com.', 'Doctoral Degree Program in Marine Biotechnology, Academia Sinica, 128 Academia Road, Section 2, Nankang, Taipei 11529, Taiwan. pengpojung@gmail.com.', 'National Museum of Marine Biology & Aquarium, Pingtung 94450, Taiwan. jinx6609@nmmba.gov.tw.', 'Graduate Institute of Marine Biology, National Dong Hwa University, Pingtung 94450, Taiwan. jinx6609@nmmba.gov.tw.', 'Department of Pharmacognosy and Natural Products Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, Ain-Shams University, Organization of African Unity Street, Abassia, Cairo 11566, Egypt. mohamed.elshazly@pharma.asu.edu.eg.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Biology, Faculty of Pharmacy and Biotechnology, German University in Cairo, Cairo 11432, Egypt. mohamed.elshazly@pharma.asu.edu.eg.', 'General Study Center, National Kaohsiung Marine University, Kaohsiung 80543, Taiwan. wusl@webmail.nkmu.edu.tw.', 'National Museum of Marine Biology & Aquarium, Pingtung 94450, Taiwan. mos19880822@gmail.com.', 'National Museum of Marine Biology & Aquarium, Pingtung 94450, Taiwan. x2219@nmmba.gov.tw.', 'Graduate Institute of Marine Biology, National Dong Hwa University, Pingtung 94450, Taiwan. x2219@nmmba.gov.tw.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20180107,Switzerland,Mar Drugs,Marine drugs,101213729,PMC5793063,['NOTNLM'],"['Molt 4 leukemia', 'SAR', 'anti-proliferation', 'aquaculture Lobophytum crassum', 'cembranoids']",2018/01/11 06:00,2018/08/07 06:00,['2018/01/11 06:00'],"['2017/11/22 00:00 [received]', '2017/12/14 00:00 [revised]', '2017/12/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/01/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/08/07 06:00 [medline]']","['md16010015 [pii]', '10.3390/md16010015 [doi]']",epublish,Mar Drugs. 2018 Jan 7;16(1). pii: md16010015. doi: 10.3390/md16010015.,20180806,1,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Diterpenes)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anthozoa/*metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Aquaculture', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Diterpenes/chemistry/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Secondary Metabolism', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",,,['The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, approximately 30% of patients need to discontinue IM due to resistance or intolerance to this drug. Both resistance and intolerance have also been observed in treatment with the second-generation TKIs-dasatinib, nilotinib, and bosutinib-and the third-generation TKI-ponatinib. The mechanisms of resistance to TKIs may be BCR-ABL1-dependent and/or BCR-ABL1-independent. Although the role of efflux pump P-glycoprotein (Pgp), codified by the ABCB1 gene, is unquestionable in drug resistance of many neoplasms, a longstanding question exists about whether Pgp has a firm implication in TKI resistance in the clinical scenario. The goal of this review is to offer an overview of ABCB1/Pgp expression/activity/polymorphisms in CML. Understanding how interactions, associations, or cooperation between Pgp and other molecules-such as inhibitor apoptosis proteins, microRNAs, or microvesicles-impact IM resistance risk may be critical in evaluating the response to TKIs in CML patients. In addition, new non-TKI compounds may be necessary in order to overcome the resistance mediated by Pgp in CML.","['Maia, Raquel C', 'Vasconcelos, Flavia C', 'Souza, Paloma S', 'Rumjanek, Vivian M']","['Maia RC', 'Vasconcelos FC', 'Souza PS', 'Rumjanek VM']","['Laboratorio de Hemato-Oncologia Celular e Molecular and Programa de Hemato-Oncologia Molecular, Instituto Nacional de Cancer (INCA), Praca da Cruz Vermelha, 23, 6 degrees andar, CEP 20230-130 Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. rcmaia@inca.gov.br.', 'Laboratorio de Hemato-Oncologia Celular e Molecular and Programa de Hemato-Oncologia Molecular, Instituto Nacional de Cancer (INCA), Praca da Cruz Vermelha, 23, 6 degrees andar, CEP 20230-130 Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. fvasconcelos@inca.gov.br.', 'Laboratorio de Hemato-Oncologia Celular e Molecular and Programa de Hemato-Oncologia Molecular, Instituto Nacional de Cancer (INCA), Praca da Cruz Vermelha, 23, 6 degrees andar, CEP 20230-130 Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. paloma.inca@gmail.com.', 'Laboratorio de Imunologia Tumoral, Instituto de Bioquimica Medica Leopoldo de Meis, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ), Av.

In order to overcome this limitation for DT2219, a promising bispecific targeted toxin which targets CD19 and CD22, we deimmunized the DT moiety, and thereby developed an exciting improved drug (dDT2219) which still has the potential to sufficiently target B-cell malignancies but also limits clearance because of its reduced immunogenicity. The DT moiety was modified by inducing point mutations in prominent positions on the molecular surface. The new engineered dDT2219 was tested for activity, efficacy, and specificity using functional assays, proliferation assays, and flow cytometry. Furthermore, 12 samples of Chronic Lymphatic Leukemia (CLL) patients were used to assess binding. Immunogenicity was determined using a BALB/c mouse model. dDT2219 was efficient and specific against B-cell malignancies such as Bukitt-Lymphoma cell lines Daudi and Raji. dDT2219 showed specific binding on targets and on CLL samples. Intraperitoneal vaccination of immune competent mice showed that even after multiple administrations with increasing doses, induction of neutralizing antibodies was significantly lower in the dDT2219 treated animal group. The new dDT2219 combines potent anti-tumor cell activity with a reduced immunogenicity. With regard to the frequent development of neutralizing antibodies after multiple administrations with immunotoxins, dDT2219 shows promise to overcome this limitation and thus might maintain effectiveness even after multiple treatment cycles.","['Schmohl, Joerg U', 'Todhunter, Deborah', 'Taras, Elizabeth', 'Bachanova, Veronika', 'Vallera, Daniel A']","['Schmohl JU', 'Todhunter D', 'Taras E', 'Bachanova V', 'Vallera DA']","['University of Minnesota Masonic Cancer Center, Section of Molecular Cancer Therapeutics, Therapeutic Radiology-Radiation Oncology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA. joerg.schmohl@med.uni-tuebingen.de.', 'Department for Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital of Tuebingen, Medical Department 2, 72076 Tuebingen, Germany. joerg.schmohl@med.uni-tuebingen.de.', 'University of Minnesota Masonic Cancer Center, Section of Molecular Cancer Therapeutics, Therapeutic Radiology-Radiation Oncology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA. todhu001@umn.edu.', 'University of Minnesota Masonic Cancer Center, Section of Molecular Cancer Therapeutics, Therapeutic Radiology-Radiation Oncology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA. taras003@umn.edu.', 'Division of Hematology, Oncology, and Transplantation, Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA. bach0173@umn.edu.', 'University of Minnesota Masonic Cancer Center, Section of Molecular Cancer Therapeutics, Therapeutic Radiology-Radiation Oncology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA. valle001@umn.edu.']",['eng'],['R01 CA036725/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180106,Switzerland,Toxins (Basel),Toxins,101530765,PMC5793119,['NOTNLM'],"['*B-cell malignancies CD19', '*CD22', '*Key Contribution', '*The new dDT2219 targeted toxin combines potent anti-tumor cell activity with a', 'reduced immunogenicity.', '*deimmunized', '*diphtheria toxin', '*immunotoxin']",2018/01/11 06:00,2018/12/24 06:00,['2018/01/11 06:00'],"['2017/10/26 00:00 [received]', '2017/12/16 00:00 [revised]', '2017/12/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/01/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/12/24 06:00 [medline]']","['toxins10010032 [pii]', '10.3390/toxins10010032 [doi]']",epublish,Toxins (Basel). 2018 Jan 6;10(1). pii: toxins10010032. doi: 10.3390/toxins10010032.,20181221,1,"['0 (Antibodies, Neutralizing)', '0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Diphtheria Toxin)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Neutralizing/immunology', 'Antigens, CD19/immunology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Diphtheria Toxin/genetics/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Immunotoxins/genetics/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 2/immunology']",,,"['The University of Minnesota and Daniel A.

However, coactivator perturbations often lead to pleiotropic effects by influencing numerous TFs. Here we identify TAF12, a subunit of TFIID and SAGA coactivator complexes, as a selective requirement for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) progression. We trace this dependency to a direct interaction between the TAF12/TAF4 histone-fold heterodimer and the transactivation domain of MYB, a TF with established roles in leukemogenesis. Ectopic expression of the TAF4 histone-fold fragment can efficiently squelch TAF12 in cells, suppress MYB, and regress AML in mice. Our study reveals a strategy for potent MYB inhibition in AML and highlights how an oncogenic TF can be selectively neutralized by targeting a general coactivator complex.","['Xu, Yali', 'Milazzo, Joseph P', 'Somerville, Tim D D', 'Tarumoto, Yusuke', 'Huang, Yu-Han', 'Ostrander, Elizabeth L', 'Wilkinson, John E', 'Challen, Grant A', 'Vakoc, Christopher R']","['Xu Y', 'Milazzo JP', 'Somerville TDD', 'Tarumoto Y', 'Huang YH', 'Ostrander EL', 'Wilkinson JE', 'Challen GA', 'Vakoc CR']","['Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724, USA; Molecular and Cellular Biology Program, Stony Brook University, New York, NY 11794, USA.', 'Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724, USA.', 'Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724, USA.', 'Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724, USA.', 'Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724, USA.', 'Division of Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO 63110, USA.', 'ULAM/Department of Pathology, University of Michigan School of Medicine, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA.', 'Division of Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO 63110, USA.', 'Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724, USA.

METHODS: We determined the CLLflow score in peripheral blood or bone marrow of a series of cases with an inconclusive immunophenotype, including samples with a MS of 3 (n = 52) and CD5-positive with a score of 2 (n = 38). As controls, B-LPD with a MS of 0-1 (n = 95), CD5-negative score 2 (n = 24), and score 4-5 (i.e., chronic lymphocytic leukemia [CLL], n = 166) were included. RESULTS: The CLLflow score was positive (suggestive of CLL) in all CLL cases and negative in all MS <2, regardless of CD200-positivity, which occurred in 31% (29/95) of cases. The CLLflow score was positive in 71%, 29%, and 8% of samples with a MS 3, CD5-positive score 2, and CD5-negative score 2, respectively. DISCUSSION: Our results suggest that the CLLflow is useful in the differential diagnosis of cases with inconclusive immunophenotype.

Fifty-two patients with CML and 26 matched healthy people were enrolled as the discovery set. Another 194 randomly selected CML patients treated with TKI were chosen as the external validation set. Plasma samples from the patients and controls were profiled using the gas chromatography-mass spectrometry-based metabonomic approach. Multivariate and univariate statistical analyses were combined to select the differential metabolic features. The gas chromatography-mass spectrometry-based metabolomics showed a clear clustering and separation of metabolic patterns from healthy controls and pre- and post-TKI treatment CML patients in the discovery set. We identified 9 metabolites that differentiated CML patients from healthy controls, including lactic acid, isoleucine, glycerol, glycine, myristic acid, d-sorbitol, d-galactose, d-glucose, and myo-inositol. Among the 9 markers, glycerol and myristic acid had the most significant association with TKI treatment effects in both discovery and external validation sets. In the receiver operating characteristic analysis, the combination of glycerol and myristic acid showed a better discrimination performance compared to a single biomarker. The results indicated that metabolic profiling has the potential for diagnosis of CML and the panel of biomarkers including myristic acid and glycerol could be useful in monitoring TKI therapeutic responses.","['Yang, Bingyu', 'Wang, Chang', 'Xie, Yiyu', 'Xu, Liangjing', 'Wu, Xiaojin', 'Wu, Depei']","['Yang B', 'Wang C', 'Xie Y', 'Xu L', 'Wu X', 'Wu D']","['Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Institute of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Suzhou, China.', 'Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Stem Cells and Biomedical Materials of Jiangsu Province and Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology, Suzhou, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Radiation Medicine and Protection, Collaborative Innovation Center of Radiological Medicine of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions, Jiangsu Provincial Key Laboratory of Radiation Medicine and Protection, School of Radiation Medicine and Protection, Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Institute of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Suzhou, China.', 'Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Stem Cells and Biomedical Materials of Jiangsu Province and Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology, Suzhou, China.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Institute of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Suzhou, China.', 'Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Stem Cells and Biomedical Materials of Jiangsu Province and Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology, Suzhou, China.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Institute of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Suzhou, China.', 'Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Stem Cells and Biomedical Materials of Jiangsu Province and Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology, Suzhou, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20180214,England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,PMC5834806,['NOTNLM'],"['chronic phase', 'gas chromatography-mass spectrometry', 'leukemia', 'metabolomics', 'myeloid']",2018/01/10 06:00,2018/03/13 06:00,['2018/01/10 06:00'],"['2017/10/16 00:00 [received]', '2017/12/16 00:00 [revised]', '2017/12/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/13 06:00 [medline]', '2018/01/10 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/cas.13500 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2018 Mar;109(3):777-784. doi: 10.1111/cas.13500.

Moreover, mutational activation of WASP has been associated with X-linked neutropenia. Although studies reported that patients with constitutional WAS mutations affecting functional WASP expression may present juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML)-like features, confounding differential diagnosis above all in the copresence of mutated RAS, an activating somatic mutation of WASP has not been previously described in JMML patients. In our ongoing studies on JMML genomics, we at first detected a somatic WAS mutation in a major clone found at two consecutive relapses in one of two twins with JMML. Both twins were treated with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation after diagnosis of JMML. The somatic WAS mutation detected here displayed an activating WASP phenotype. Screening of 46 sporadic JMML patients at disease onset for mutations in the same PBD domain of WAS revealed two additional singleton patients carrying minor mutated clones. This is the first study to associate somatically acquired WASP mutations with a hematopoietic malignancy and increases insight in the complexity of the genomic landscape of JMML that shows low recurrent mutations concomitant with general hyperactivation of RAS pathway signaling.","['Coppe, Alessandro', 'Nogara, Leonardo', 'Pizzuto, Matteo Samuele', 'Cani, Alice', 'Cesaro, Simone', 'Masetti, Riccardo', 'Locatelli, Franco', 'Te Kronnie, Geertruy', 'Basso, Giuseppe', 'Bortoluzzi, Stefania', 'Bresolin, Silvia']","['Coppe A', 'Nogara L', 'Pizzuto MS', 'Cani A', 'Cesaro S', 'Masetti R', 'Locatelli F', 'Te Kronnie G', 'Basso G', 'Bortoluzzi S', 'Bresolin S']","['Department of Molecular Medicine, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.', ""Laboratory of Onco-Hematology, Department of Women's and Children's Health, University of Padova, Padova, Italy."", ""Laboratory of Onco-Hematology, Department of Women's and Children's Health, University of Padova, Padova, Italy."", 'Pediatric Hematology Oncology, Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Integrata, Verona, Italy.', 'Oncologia ed Ematologia Pediatrica ""Lalla Seragnoli"", University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.', 'Department of Pediatric Onco-Hematology, IRCCS Ospedale Pediatrico Bambino Gesu, Roma, Italy.', ""Laboratory of Onco-Hematology, Department of Women's and Children's Health, University of Padova, Padova, Italy."", ""Laboratory of Onco-Hematology, Department of Women's and Children's Health, University of Padova, Padova, Italy."", 'Department of Molecular Medicine, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.', ""Laboratory of Onco-Hematology, Department of Women's and Children's Health, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180119,United States,Hum Mutat,Human mutation,9215429,,['NOTNLM'],"['*JMML', '*RAS pathway', '*WASP', '*sequencing']",2018/01/10 06:00,2019/04/24 06:00,['2018/01/10 06:00'],"['2017/06/15 00:00 [received]', '2017/12/02 00:00 [revised]', '2017/12/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/24 06:00 [medline]', '2018/01/10 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/humu.23399 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Mutat. 2018 Apr;39(4):579-587. doi: 10.1002/humu.23399.

The median age at the time of pPCL diagnosis was 61 years. Ninety-eight patients were treated with novel agents, with an overall response rate of 78%. Fifty-five patients (64%) patients underwent upfront autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT). The median follow-up time was 50 months (95% confidence interval [CI] 33; 76), with a median overall survival (OS) for the entire group of 23 months (95% CI 15; 34). The median OS time in patients who underwent upfront ASCT was 35 months (95% CI 24.3; 46) as compared to 13 months (95% CI 6.3; 35.8) in patients who did not receive ASCT (P = 0.001). Multivariate analyses identified age >/=60 years, platelet count </=100 x 10(9) /l and peripheral blood plasma cell count >/=20 x 10(9) /l as independent predictors of worse survival. The median OS in patients with 0, 1 or 2-3 of these risk factors was 46, 27 and 12 months, respectively (P < 0.001). Our findings support the use of novel agents and ASCT as frontline treatment in patients with pPCL.

Its spontaneous retrotransposition and the accumulation of heritable L1 insertions can potentially result in genome instability and sporadic disorders. Moloney leukemia virus 10 homolog (MOV10), a putative RNA helicase, has been implicated in inhibiting L1 replication, although its underlying mechanism of action remains obscure. Moreover, the physiological relevance of MOV10-mediated L1 regulation in human disease has not yet been examined. Using a proteomic approach, we identified RNASEH2 as a binding partner of MOV10. We show that MOV10 interacts with RNASEH2, and their interplay is crucial for restricting L1 retrotransposition. RNASEH2 and MOV10 co-localize in the nucleus, and RNASEH2 binds to L1 RNAs in a MOV10-dependent manner. Small hairpin RNA-mediated depletion of either RNASEH2A or MOV10 results in an accumulation of L1-specific RNA-DNA hybrids, suggesting they contribute to prevent formation of vital L1 heteroduplexes during retrotransposition. Furthermore, we show that RNASEH2-MOV10-mediated L1 restriction downregulates expression of the rheumatoid arthritis-associated inflammatory cytokines and matrix-degrading proteinases in synovial cells, implicating a potential causal relationship between them and disease development in terms of disease predisposition.","['Choi, Jongsu', 'Hwang, Sung-Yeon', 'Ahn, Kwangseog']","['Choi J', 'Hwang SY', 'Ahn K']","['Center for RNA Research, Institute for Basic Science, Seoul 08826, Republic of Korea.', 'School of Biological Sciences, Seoul National University, Seoul 08826, Republic of Korea.', 'Center for RNA Research, Institute for Basic Science, Seoul 08826, Republic of Korea.', 'School of Biological Sciences, Seoul National University, Seoul 08826, Republic of Korea.', 'Center for RNA Research, Institute for Basic Science, Seoul 08826, Republic of Korea.', 'School of Biological Sciences, Seoul National University, Seoul 08826, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Nucleic Acids Res,Nucleic acids research,0411011,PMC5829647,,,2018/01/10 06:00,2019/07/16 06:00,['2018/01/10 06:00'],"['2017/09/28 00:00 [received]', '2017/12/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/16 06:00 [medline]', '2018/01/10 06:00 [entrez]']","['4791130 [pii]', '10.1093/nar/gkx1312 [doi]']",ppublish,Nucleic Acids Res. 2018 Feb 28;46(4):1912-1926. doi: 10.1093/nar/gkx1312.,20190715,4,"['0 (L1 ORF1 protein, human)', '0 (Ribonucleoproteins)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Mov10 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.26.4 (Ribonuclease H)', 'EC 3.1.26.4 (ribonuclease HI)', 'EC 3.6.4.13 (RNA Helicases)']",IM,"['Arthritis, Rheumatoid/genetics', 'Cell Line', 'DNA/metabolism', 'Disease Progression', 'Humans', '*Long Interspersed Nucleotide Elements', 'RNA/metabolism', 'RNA Helicases/*metabolism', 'Ribonuclease H/*metabolism', 'Ribonucleoproteins/metabolism']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As T cell defects are common in patients with CLL, we compared the T cells from these patients with healthy donors (HDs), and subsequently the CD19 CAR T cells produced from patients and HDs. Despite initial differences when comparing the phenotype of circulating T cells in patients with CLL and HDs, the CD19 CAR T cells manufactured from patients' or HDs' cells showed a similar phenotype (effector memory or terminally differentiated), both were specifically activated by and killed CD19 target cells, and secreted cytokines (ie, IL-2, TNF, and IFN-gamma). The frequency of CD19 CAR T cells producing IFN-gamma was significantly higher in cells produced from patients as compared with those produced from HDs. Furthermore, our data showed that the polyfunctional profile of CD19 CAR T cells was differently modulated by CD19 K562 cells and autologous B cells. The increased IFN-gamma production by CD19 CAR T cells produced from patients with CLL after in vitro stimulation, may if this is also the case in vivo, contribute to a higher risk of a cytokine release syndrome in patients. The different impact by CD19 target cells on the polyfunctional profile of CD19 CAR T cells in vitro underlines the importance of the choice of CD19 target cells when assessing CD19 CAR T cells functions.","['Magalhaes, Isabelle', 'Kalland, Ingrid', 'Kochenderfer, James N', 'Osterborg, Anders', 'Uhlin, Michael', 'Mattsson, Jonas']","['Magalhaes I', 'Kalland I', 'Kochenderfer JN', 'Osterborg A', 'Uhlin M', 'Mattsson J']","['Department of Oncology-Pathology.', 'Department of Oncology-Pathology.', 'Experimental Transplantation and Immunology Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD.', 'Department of Oncology-Pathology.', 'Departments of Hematology.', 'Department of Clinical Science, Division of Surgery, Intervention and Technology, Karolinska Institutet.', 'Clinical Immunology and Transfusion Medicine.', 'Department of Oncology-Pathology.', 'Center for Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation, Karolinska University Hospital, Huddinge, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],['ZIA BC011415/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Immunother,"Journal of immunotherapy (Hagerstown, Md. : 1997)",9706083,PMC8057115,,,2018/01/10 06:00,2019/09/12 06:00,['2018/01/10 06:00'],"['2018/01/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/12 06:00 [medline]', '2018/01/10 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/CJI.0000000000000193 [doi]'],ppublish,J Immunother. 2018 Feb/Mar;41(2):73-83. doi: 10.1097/CJI.0000000000000193.,20190911,2,"['0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Chimeric Antigen)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD19/genetics/*immunology', 'Biomarkers', 'Cell Degranulation', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/methods', 'Interferon-gamma/*biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology/metabolism/pathology/therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Phenotype', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Chimeric Antigen/genetics/*metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/metabolism']",,,,['NIHMS1681818'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In general, mastocytosis has a good prognosis in terms of life expectancy. Rare variants - including mast cell leukemia, aggressive mastocytosis, and the exceedingly rare mast cell sarcoma - require cytoreductive therapy.

This study aimed to distinguish these two entities. METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied bone marrow NK/T-cell neoplasms by classifying them into those with no extramedullary mass (group 1, eight cases) and those with extramedullary mass (group 2, 13 cases). The two groups showed similar clinical presentations and pathological features. Fever and cytopenia were the most common clinical presentations in both groups. The neoplastic cells varied from small and relatively monotonous cells to large pleomorphic cells. In six cases (two in group 1, and four in group 2), the neoplastic infiltrate was inconspicuous, consisting of </=10% of marrow cells in the interstitium, which were hardly identified by haematoxylin and eosin staining alone. Nearly all patients rapidly died, regardless of the neoplastic infiltrate volume. All of the group 1 patients fulfilled the World Health Organisation 2017 diagnostic criteria of ANKCL, and their survival was significantly worse than that of the group 2 patients (P = 0.035). In addition, there was a significant association between being in group 1 and chromosome 7 abnormalities. Chromosome 6q deletion, which is commonly reported in ENKTCL, was seen in two of our group 2 patients, and was not observed in any of our group 1 patients. CONCLUSION: ANKCL with no extramedullary mass should be distinguished from ENKTCL with bone marrow involvement, as the former shows distinct outcomes and genetic features.","['Yang, Ching-Fen', 'Hsu, Chih-Yi', 'Ho, Donald M-T']","['Yang CF', 'Hsu CY', 'Ho DM']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'School of Medicine, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'School of Medicine, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'College of Nursing, National Taipei University of Nursing and Health Sciences, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'School of Medicine, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Cheng Hsin General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20180226,England,Histopathology,Histopathology,7704136,,['NOTNLM'],"['NK/T cell', 'cytogenetics', 'leukaemia', 'lymphoma', 'prognosis']",2018/01/10 06:00,2018/09/07 06:00,['2018/01/10 06:00'],"['2017/10/15 00:00 [received]', '2017/12/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/09/07 06:00 [medline]', '2018/01/10 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/his.13463 [doi]'],ppublish,Histopathology. 2018 May;72(6):955-964. doi: 10.1111/his.13463.

METHODS AND RESULTS: Of a series of 15 Japanese patients (11 women, four men; median age 74 years, range 35-84 years), seven received MTX for the treatment of autoimmune disease and eight developed EBVMCU after treatment of malignant lymphoma [diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (n = 4) without EBV association, adult T-cell leukaemia/lymphoma (n = 2), angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (n = 1), and follicular lymphoma (n = 1)]. Ulcers were observed in the oral cavity (n = 11), gastrointestinal tract (n = 2), and skin (n = 2). All were histologically characterised by a mixture of EBV-positive large B-cell proliferation and Hodgkin/Reed-Sternberg-like cells on a polymorphous background. A total of 46% (6/13) had monoclonal immunoglobulin heavy chain gene rearrangement, but none had clonal T-cell receptor gene rearrangement. Spontaneous regression occurred in 13 of 15 cases (87%); the other two cases (13%) achieved complete remission after treatment. Of two patients in the treated lymphoma-associated subgroup, one developed multiple new ulcerative lesions on previously unaffected skin, and the other had a relapse of EBVMCU in the oral cavity. No significant clinicopathological differences were found between the subgroups. Notably, none of the patients died from EBVMCU. However, the treated lymphoma-associated subgroup had lower overall survival (P = 0.004) and a shorter follow-up period (P = 0.003) than the MTX-associated subgroup, owing to death from non-associated causes. CONCLUSIONS: Treated lymphoma-associated EBVMCU, which is an indolent and self-limited condition, must be recognised to avoid misdiagnosing it as a relapse of malignant lymphoma during treatment.","['Daroontum, Teerada', 'Kohno, Kei', 'Eladl, Ahmed E', 'Satou, Akira', 'Sakakibara, Ayako', 'Matsukage, Shoichi', 'Yakushiji, Naoki', 'Ya-In, Charin', 'Nakamura, Shigeo', 'Asano, Naoko', 'Kato, Seiichi']","['Daroontum T', 'Kohno K', 'Eladl AE', 'Satou A', 'Sakakibara A', 'Matsukage S', 'Yakushiji N', 'Ya-In C', 'Nakamura S', 'Asano N', 'Kato S']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Nagoya University Hospital, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Nagoya University Hospital, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Nagoya University Hospital, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Mansoura University, Mansoura, Egypt.', 'Department of Surgical Pathology, Aichi Medical University Hospital, Nagakate, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Nagoya University Hospital, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology and Division of Dermatology, Uwajima City Hospital, Uwajima, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology and Division of Dermatology, Uwajima City Hospital, Uwajima, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Nagoya University Hospital, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, Nagano Prefectural Suzaka Hospital, Nagano, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology and Molecular Diagnostics, Aichi Cancer Centre Hospital, Aichi, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20180307,England,Histopathology,Histopathology,7704136,,['NOTNLM'],"['EBV-positive mucocutaneous ulcer', 'methotrexate-associated EBVMCU', 'treated lymphoma-associated EBVMCU']",2018/01/10 06:00,2018/09/27 06:00,['2018/01/10 06:00'],"['2017/10/24 00:00 [received]', '2017/12/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/09/27 06:00 [medline]', '2018/01/10 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/his.13464 [doi]'],ppublish,Histopathology. 2018 Jun;72(7):1115-1127. doi: 10.1111/his.13464.

One potential reason is that radiation epidemiological studies that adjust for tobacco smoking, which heavily influences mortality, have been limited. In the present study, we examined radiation-related cancer risk by directly assessing the possible confounding effect of smoking, using data from two questionnaire surveys performed among Japanese nuclear workers in 1997 and 2003. Mortality follow-up was carried out for 71 733 male respondents for an average of 8.2 years during the observation period of 1999-2010. The mean cumulative dose was 25.5 mSv at the end of the follow-up period. Estimates of excess relative risk per Sv (ERRs/Sv) were obtained by Poisson regression. By adjusting for smoking directly on the basis of a linear dose-response model, we quantified the confounding effects of smoking on radiation risks. Statistically significant ERRs/Sv were found for all causes, all diseases, all non-cancer diseases, and liver cancer: 0.97 (90% confidence interval: 0.23, 1.78), 1.32 (0.40, 2.34), 1.87 (0.47, 3.49), and 4.78 (0.09, 11.68), respectively, without adjustment for smoking. However, the ERRs/Sv were no longer statistically significant after adjustment for smoking: 0.45 (-0.22, 1.19), 0.77 (-0.08, 1.72), 1.28 (-0.03, 2.79), and 3.89 (-0.46, 10.34), respectively. The ERRs/Sv for all cancers excluding leukaemia and lung cancer were not significant before adjustment for smoking, but declined after adjustment for smoking. The present study demonstrates that in this cohort of workers, smoking heavily distorts radiation risk estimates of mortality. The possibility of confounding by smoking depends on how strongly smoking is correlated with radiation exposure. If a correlation between smoking and radiation dose is suggested, smoking is an important confounder when assessing the radiation and health risks.","[""Kudo, Shin'ichi"", ""Ishida, Jun'ichi"", 'Yoshimoto, Keiko', 'Mizuno, Shoichi', 'Ohshima, Sumio', 'Furuta, Hiroshige', 'Kasagi, Fumiyoshi']","['Kudo S', 'Ishida J', 'Yoshimoto K', 'Mizuno S', 'Ohshima S', 'Furuta H', 'Kasagi F']","['Institute of Radiation Epidemiology, Radiation Effects Association, 1-9-16 Kajicho, Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo, 101-0044, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20180109,England,J Radiol Prot,Journal of radiological protection : official journal of the Society for Radiological Protection,8809257,,,,2018/01/10 06:00,2019/11/05 06:00,['2018/01/10 06:00'],"['2018/01/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/05 06:00 [medline]', '2018/01/10 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1088/1361-6498/aaa65c [doi]'],ppublish,J Radiol Prot. 2018 Mar;38(1):357-371. doi: 10.1088/1361-6498/aaa65c.

Management of patients with PV and ET is fraught with difficulties as they have an inherent tendency to cause thrombotic and hemorrhagic events. There are no curative treatment options, therefore it is important that a risk-adapted treatment approach is applied. Areas covered: This review discusses existing literature about prognosis in PV and ET, and addresses critical aspects related to defining 'high-risk' disease. In addition to the traditional risk factors such as age and prior thrombotic history, we discuss the prognostic impact of additional parameters such as cardiovascular risk factors, white blood cell count, karyotype and gene mutations. Expert commentary: We use age>60 years, presence of JAK2 mutation and a prior thrombotic history as the principle determinants of 'high-risk' for thrombosis in PV and ET, dividing the patients into very-low, low, intermediate and high-risk disease. Typically, low-risk patients are treated either with observation or aspirin alone. High-risk patients require cytoreductive therapies, along with aspirin and/or systemic anticoagulation. Intermediate-risk patients are treated on a case-by-case basis. Further, we aim to maintain a hematocrit <45% with aggressive phlebotomy in patients with PV.","['Mangaonkar, Abhishek A', 'Hoversten, Katherine P', 'Gangat, Naseema']","['Mangaonkar AA', 'Hoversten KP', 'Gangat N']","['a Department of Hematology , Mayo Clinic , Rochester , MN , USA.', 'b Department of Internal Medicine , Mayo Clinic , Rochester , MN , USA.', 'a Department of Hematology , Mayo Clinic , Rochester , MN , USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20180120,England,Expert Rev Hematol,Expert review of hematology,101485942,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Polycythemia Vera', '*acute myeloid leukemia', '*essential thrombocythemia', '*high-risk', '*myelofibrosis', '*thrombosis', '*thrombotic risk']",2018/01/10 06:00,2019/01/04 06:00,['2018/01/10 06:00'],"['2018/01/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/04 06:00 [medline]', '2018/01/10 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/17474086.2018.1426455 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Rev Hematol. 2018 Mar;11(3):247-252. doi: 10.1080/17474086.2018.1426455.

However, the sparse use of animal models has precluded a full understanding of their pathophysiological roles at the organismal level. In a recent article in Cancer Cell, we have reported that the Vav1 GEF unexpectedly acts as a tumor suppressor by mediating the noncatalytic nucleation of cytoplasmic complexes between the E3 ubiquitin ligase Cbl-b and the active Notch1 intracellular domain (ICN1). These complexes favor the ubiquitinylation-mediated degradation of ICN1 in the proteosome and, therefore, the dampening of ICN1 signals in cells. The elimination of Vav1 in mice exacerbates ICN1 signaling in specific thymocyte subpopulations and, in collaboration with ancillary mutations, prompts the development of ICN1-driven T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). This new Vav1-dependent pathway antagonizes the fitness of T-ALL of the TLX(+) clinical subtype in humans. As a result, VAV1 is found recurrently silenced in both TLX(+) T-ALL cell lines and patients. These results call for an overall reevaluation of Rho GEF function in cancer.","['Robles-Valero, Javier', 'Lorenzo-Martin, L Francisco', 'Fernandez-Pisonero, Isabel', 'Bustelo, Xose R']","['Robles-Valero J', 'Lorenzo-Martin LF', 'Fernandez-Pisonero I', 'Bustelo XR']","['Centro de Investigacion del Cancer, CSIC-University of Salamanca , Salamanca, Spain.', 'Instituto de Biologia Molecular y Celular del Cancer, CSIC-University of Salamanca , Salamanca, Spain.', 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de Cancer (CIBERONC), CSIC-University of Salamanca , Salamanca, Spain.', 'Centro de Investigacion del Cancer, CSIC-University of Salamanca , Salamanca, Spain.', 'Instituto de Biologia Molecular y Celular del Cancer, CSIC-University of Salamanca , Salamanca, Spain.', 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de Cancer (CIBERONC), CSIC-University of Salamanca , Salamanca, Spain.', 'Centro de Investigacion del Cancer, CSIC-University of Salamanca , Salamanca, Spain.', 'Instituto de Biologia Molecular y Celular del Cancer, CSIC-University of Salamanca , Salamanca, Spain.', 'Centro de Investigacion del Cancer, CSIC-University of Salamanca , Salamanca, Spain.', 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de Cancer (CIBERONC), CSIC-University of Salamanca , Salamanca, Spain.']",['eng'],['14-1248/AICR_/Worldwide Cancer Research/United Kingdom'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180124,United States,Small GTPases,Small GTPases,101530974,PMC7549630,['NOTNLM'],"['*Cbl-b', '*Notch1', '*Rho GTPases', '*TLX', '*Vav1', '*lymphoma']",2018/01/10 06:00,2021/07/17 06:00,['2018/01/10 06:00'],"['2018/01/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/17 06:00 [medline]', '2018/01/10 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/21541248.2018.1423851 [doi]'],ppublish,Small GTPases. 2020 Jul;11(4):233-239. doi: 10.1080/21541248.2018.1423851.

METHODS: One thousand and four (792 urban and 193 rural) support persons of adults diagnosed with haematological cancer were recruited from five Australian state population-based cancer registries. Participants completed the Support Person Unmet Needs Survey (SPUNS) that assessed the level of unmet needs experienced over the past month across six domains. RESULTS: Overall, 66% of support persons had at least one 'moderate, high or very high' unmet need and 24% (n = 182) reported having multiple (i.e. 6 or more) 'high/very high' unmet needs in the past month. There were no significant differences between rural and urban support persons in the prevalence of multiple unmet needs or mean total unmet needs scores. There were however significant differences in the types of 'high/very high' unmet needs with support persons living in rural areas more likely to report finance-related unmet needs. Support persons who indicated they had difficulty paying bills had significantly higher odds of reporting multiple 'high/very high' unmet needs. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first large, population-based study to compare the unmet needs of support persons of haematological cancer survivors living in rural and urban areas. Findings confirm previous evidence that supporting a person diagnosed with haematological cancer correlates with a high level of unmet needs and highlight the importance of developing systemic strategies for assisting support persons, especially in regard to making financial assistance and travel subsidies known and readily accessible to those living in rural areas.","['Lynagh, Marita C', 'Williamson, A', 'Bradstock, K', 'Campbell, S', 'Carey, M', 'Paul, C', 'Tzelepis, F', 'Sanson-Fisher, R']","['Lynagh MC', 'Williamson A', 'Bradstock K', 'Campbell S', 'Carey M', 'Paul C', 'Tzelepis F', 'Sanson-Fisher R']","['School of Medicine and Public Health, University of Newcastle, Level 4, West, HMRI Building, Callaghan, NSW, 2308, Australia.

Single agent activity of HDAC inhibitors (HDACi) has been elusive in ALL, and has prompted study of combinatorial strategies. Because several HDACi raise levels of intracellular oxidative stress, we evaluated combinations of two structurally distinct HDACi with the redox active compound adaphostin in ALL. METHODS: The HDACi vorinostat and entinostat were tested in combination with adaphostin in human ALL cell lines. DNA fragmentation, caspase activation, mitochondrial disruption and levels of intracellular peroxides, superoxide and glutathione were measured in cells treated with the HDACi/adaphostin combinations. Antioxidant blockade of cell death induction and gene expression profiling of cells treated with vorinostat/adaphostin versus entinostat/adaphostin combinations were evaluated. RESULTS: Both combinations synergistically induced apoptotic DNA fragmentation, which was preceded by an increase in superoxide levels, a reduction in mitochondrial membrane potential, and an increase in caspase-9 activation. The antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) blocked superoxide generation and prevented reduction of mitochondrial membrane potential. NAC decreased DNA fragmentation and caspase activity in cells treated with adaphostin and vorinostat, but not in those treated with adaphostin and entinostat. Gene expression arrays revealed differential regulation of several redox genes prior to cell death induction. CONCLUSIONS: A redox modulatory agent, adaphostin, enhances efficacy of two HDACi, vorinostat or entinostat, but via different mechanisms indicating a point of divergence in the mechanisms of synergy between the two distinct HDACi and adaphostin.","['Rivera-Del Valle, Nilsa', 'Cheng, Tiewei', 'Irwin, Mary E', 'Donnella, Hayley', 'Singh, Melissa M', 'Chandra, Joya']","['Rivera-Del Valle N', 'Cheng T', 'Irwin ME', 'Donnella H', 'Singh MM', 'Chandra J']","[""Department of Pediatrics Research, Children's Cancer Hospital, The University of Texas (UT) M.

Destructive bone lesions have a negative impact on the quality of life of leukemia patients, causing unbearable pain and, in some cases, limb paralysis. However, the mechanism, by which leukemic cells produce destructive bone lesions, and the effect of therapeutics on osteolytic lesions have not been fully elucidated yet and, thus, stand to benefit from an in vivo model. To that end, HL-60 cells were transformed by retrovirus-mediated constitutively active (CA) STAT5 expression and injected into nonobese diabetic (NOD)/SCID mice via the tail vein. After three weeks, lumbar spines were subjected to histocytometric analysis. Xenograft mice developed hind limb paralysis in 2-3 weeks, which was consistent with the consequences of spinal bone destruction by extramedullary invasion of leukemia cells. The in vivo model will improve the understanding and treatment of osteolytic bone lesions caused by myeloid leukemic cells.","['Chen, Jia-Jie', 'Zhou, Wei', 'Cai, Nan', 'Chang, Gang']","['Chen JJ', 'Zhou W', 'Cai N', 'Chang G']","['Institute of Molecular Medicine, Health Science Center, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen 518060, China.', 'Vaccine Research Institute of Sun Yat-sen University, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Spine Surgery and Joint Surgery, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou 510150, China.', 'Vaccine Research Institute of Sun Yat-sen University, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Institute of Molecular Medicine, Health Science Center, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen 518060, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20170928,United States,Biomed Res Int,BioMed research international,101600173,PMC5637823,,,2018/01/10 06:00,2018/08/08 06:00,['2018/01/10 06:00'],"['2017/04/23 00:00 [received]', '2017/08/06 00:00 [revised]', '2017/08/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/01/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/08/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2017/3521481 [doi]'],ppublish,Biomed Res Int. 2017;2017:3521481. doi: 10.1155/2017/3521481.

We present our experience integrating genomic data into the clinical management of children with high-risk hematologic malignancies and blood disorders and describe the broad impact that genomic profiling has in multiple aspects of patient care. Methods: The Precision in Pediatric Sequencing Program at Columbia University Medical Center instituted prospective clinical next-generation sequencing (NGS) for high-risk malignancies and blood disorders. Testing included cancer whole exome sequencing (WES) of matched tumor-normal samples or targeted sequencing of 467 cancer-associated genes, when sample adequacy was a concern, and tumor transcriptome (RNA-seq). A multidisciplinary molecular tumor board conducted interpretation of results and final tiered reports were transmitted to the electronic medical record according to patient preferences. Results: Sixty-nine samples from 56 patients with high-risk hematologic malignancies and blood disorders were sequenced. Patients carried diagnoses of myeloid malignancy (n = 25), lymphoid malignancy (n = 25), or histiocytic disorder (n = 6). Six patients had only constitutional WES, performed for a suspicion of an inherited predisposition for their disease. For the remaining 50 patients, tumor was sequenced with matched normal tissue when available. The mean number of somatic variants per sample was low across the different disease categories (2.85 variants/sample). Interestingly, a gene fusion was identified by RNA-seq in 58% of samples who had adequate RNA available for testing. Molecular profiling of tumor tissue led to clinically impactful findings in 90% of patients. Forty patients (80%) had at least one targetable gene variant or fusion identified in their tumor tissue; however, only seven received targeted therapy. Importantly, NGS findings contributed to the refinement of diagnosis and prognosis for 34% of patients. Known or likely pathogenic germline alterations were discovered in 24% of patients involving cancer predisposition genes in 12% of cases. Conclusion: Incorporating whole exome and transcriptome profiling of tumor and normal tissue into clinical practice is feasible, and the value that comprehensive testing provides extends beyond the ability to target-specific mutations.","['Marks, Lianna J', 'Oberg, Jennifer A', 'Pendrick, Danielle', 'Sireci, Anthony N', 'Glasser, Chana', 'Coval, Carrie', 'Zylber, Rebecca J', 'Chung, Wendy K', 'Pang, Jiuhong', 'Turk, Andrew T', 'Hsiao, Susan J', 'Mansukhani, Mahesh M', 'Glade Bender, Julia L', 'Kung, Andrew L', 'Sulis, Maria Luisa']","['Marks LJ', 'Oberg JA', 'Pendrick D', 'Sireci AN', 'Glasser C', 'Coval C', 'Zylber RJ', 'Chung WK', 'Pang J', 'Turk AT', 'Hsiao SJ', 'Mansukhani MM', 'Glade Bender JL', 'Kung AL', 'Sulis ML']","['Department of Pediatric Oncology, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, United States.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplant, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, United States.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplant, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, United States.', 'Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, United States.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, NYU Winthrop University Medical Center, Mineola, NY, United States.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, United States.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplant, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, United States.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, United States.', 'Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, United States.', 'Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, United States.', 'Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, United States.', 'Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, United States.', 'Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, United States.', 'Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, United States.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplant, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, United States.', 'Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, United States.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, United States.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplant, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, United States.', 'Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, United States.']",['eng'],['P30 CA013696/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['Journal Article'],20171212,Switzerland,Front Pediatr,Frontiers in pediatrics,101615492,PMC5732960,['NOTNLM'],"['genomic', 'hematologic malignancies', 'next-generation sequencing', 'pediatric leukemia', 'targeted therapy']",2018/01/10 06:00,2018/01/10 06:01,['2018/01/10 06:00'],"['2017/10/22 00:00 [received]', '2017/11/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/01/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/10 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fped.2017.00265 [doi]'],epublish,Front Pediatr. 2017 Dec 12;5:265. doi: 10.3389/fped.2017.00265. eCollection 2017.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, recent development of new technologies including next-generation sequencing (NGS) has increased our understanding of the biological and genetic underpinnings of leukemia, resulting in novel diagnostic and treatment paradigms. The most prevalent pediatric leukemias include B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). These leukemias are highly heterogeneous, both clinically and genetically. There are multiple genetic subgroups defined by the World Health Organization, each with distinct clinical management. Clinical laboratories have started adopting genomic testing strategies to include high-throughput sequencing assays which, together with conventional cytogenetic techniques, enable optimal patient care. This review summarizes genetic and genomic techniques used in clinical laboratories to support management of pediatric leukemia, highlighting technical, biological, and clinical advances. We illustrate clinical utilities of comprehensive genomic evaluation of leukemia genomes through clinical case examples, which includes the interrogations of hundreds of genes and multiple mutation mechanisms using NGS technologies. Finally, we provide a future perspective on clinical genomics and precision medicine.","['Lalonde, Emilie', 'Wertheim, Gerald', 'Li, Marilyn M']","['Lalonde E', 'Wertheim G', 'Li MM']","['Department of Genetics, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, United States.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, United States.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, United States.', ""Center for Childhood Cancer Research, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, United States.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20171214,Switzerland,Front Pediatr,Frontiers in pediatrics,101615492,PMC5735078,['NOTNLM'],"['diagnosis', 'genomic profiling', 'pediatric leukemia', 'prognosis', 'therapy']",2018/01/10 06:00,2018/01/10 06:01,['2018/01/10 06:00'],"['2017/09/15 00:00 [received]', '2017/11/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/01/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/10 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fped.2017.00263 [doi]'],epublish,Front Pediatr. 2017 Dec 14;5:263. doi: 10.3389/fped.2017.00263. eCollection 2017.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Phloridzin (PZ), a flavonoid precursor found in apple peels, was acylated with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) yielding a novel ester known as phloridzin docosahexaenoate (PZ-DHA). Here, we have studied the cytotoxic effects of PZ-DHA on human leukemia cells using in vitro and in vivo models. The inhibitory effects of PZ-DHA were tested on human Jurkat T-ALL cells in comparison to K562 chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cells and non-malignant murine T-cells. PZ-DHA, not PZ or DHA alone, reduced cell viability and ATP levels, increased intracellular LDH release, and caused extensive morphological alterations in both Jurkat and K562 cells. PZ-DHA also inhibited cell proliferation, and selectively induced apoptosis in Jurkat and K562 cells while sparing normal murine T-cells. The cytotoxic effects of PZ-DHA on Jurkat cells were associated with caspase activation, DNA fragmentation, and selective down-regulation of STAT3 phosphorylation. PZ-DHA significantly inhibited Jurkat cell proliferation in zebrafish larvae; however, the proliferation of K562 cells was not affected in vivo. We propose that PZ-DHA-induced cytotoxic response is selective towards T-ALL in the presence of a tumor-stromal microenvironment. Prospective studies evaluating the combinatorial effects of PZ-DHA with conventional chemotherapy for T-ALL are underway.","['Arumuggam, Niroshaathevi', 'Melong, Nicole', 'Too, Catherine Kl', 'Berman, Jason N', 'Rupasinghe, Hp Vasantha']","['Arumuggam N', 'Melong N', 'Too CK', 'Berman JN', 'Rupasinghe HV']","['Department of Plant, Food, & Environmental Sciences, Faculty of Agriculture, Dalhousie UniversityTruro, NS B2N 5E3, Canada.', 'IWK Health CentreHalifax, NS B3K 6R8, Canada.', 'Department of Biochemistry & Molecular Biology, Dalhousie University, Faculty of MedicineHalifax, NS B3H 4R2, Canada.', 'IWK Health CentreHalifax, NS B3K 6R8, Canada.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Dalhousie University, Faculty of MedicineHalifax, NS B3H 4R2, Canada.', 'Department of Pathology, Dalhousie University, Faculty of MedicineHalifax, NS B3H 4R2, Canada.', 'Department of Plant, Food, & Environmental Sciences, Faculty of Agriculture, Dalhousie UniversityTruro, NS B2N 5E3, Canada.', 'Department of Pathology, Dalhousie University, Faculty of MedicineHalifax, NS B3H 4R2, Canada.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20171201,United States,Am J Cancer Res,American journal of cancer research,101549944,PMC5752686,['NOTNLM'],"['Phloridzin', 'STAT3', 'apoptosis', 'cytotoxicity', 'docosahexaenoic acid', 'flavonoid derivative', 'leukemia', 'proliferation', 'zebrafish']",2018/01/10 06:00,2018/01/10 06:01,['2018/01/10 06:00'],"['2017/07/24 00:00 [received]', '2017/08/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/01/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/10 06:01 [medline]']",,epublish,Am J Cancer Res. 2017 Dec 1;7(12):2452-2464. eCollection 2017.,,12,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The expression of uc.38, a T-UCR, was down-regulated in both breast cancer tissues and breast cancer cell lines. However, uc.38 was expressed at significantly lower levels in larger tumours and tumours of more advanced stages. Based on the results of in vitro and in vivo experiments, up-regulation of uc.38 expression inhibited cell proliferation and induced cell apoptosis. Thus, uc.38 suppressed breast cancer. Additional experiments revealed that uc.38 negatively regulated the expression of the pre-B-cell leukaemia homeobox 1 (PBX1) protein and subsequently affected the expression of Bcl-2 family members, ultimately inducing breast cancer cell apoptosis.

In this work, we demonstrate that tigecycline, a FDA-approved antibiotic, is an attractive candidate for ALL treatment. Tigecycline inhibits growth and induces apoptosis of multiple ALL cell lines. Compared to normal hematopoietic cells, tigecycline is more active against primary lymphocytes and CD34 progenitors from ALL patients through decreasing survival and clonogenic growth. Notably, tigecycline significantly augments the efficacy of chemotherapeutic drugs, such as doxorubicin and vincristine, in ALL cell lines, primary samples and xenograft mouse model. Tigecycline acts on ALL via inhibiting mitochondrial respiration, leading to energy crisis and oxidative stress and damage. We show that the enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis and increased oxygen consumption rate in ALL versus normal hematopoietic cells are important for their different sensitivity to tigecycline. We further show that ATP production and growth rate are largely affected in mitochondrial respiration-deficient rho0 ALL cells. Our work provides pre-clinical evidence for repurposing tigecycline for ALL treatment and highlights the therapeutic value of targeting mitochondrial metabolism in sensitizing ALL to chemotherapy.","['Fu, Xuedong', 'Liu, Wei', 'Huang, Qian', 'Wang, Yanjun', 'Li, Huijuan', 'Xiong, Ying']","['Fu X', 'Liu W', 'Huang Q', 'Wang Y', 'Li H', 'Xiong Y']","['Department of Pediatrics, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan UniversityWuhan 430071, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan UniversityWuhan 430071, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan UniversityWuhan 430071, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan UniversityWuhan 430071, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan UniversityWuhan 430071, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan UniversityWuhan 430071, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20171201,United States,Am J Cancer Res,American journal of cancer research,101549944,PMC5752682,['NOTNLM'],"['Tigecycline', 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'mitochondria respiration']",2018/01/10 06:00,2018/01/10 06:01,['2018/01/10 06:00'],"['2017/10/29 00:00 [received]', '2017/11/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/01/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/10 06:01 [medline]']",,epublish,Am J Cancer Res. 2017 Dec 1;7(12):2395-2405. eCollection 2017.,,12,,,,,,['None.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We use MARCoNI to determine the GR coregulator profile of glucocorticoid-sensitive (MM and ALL) and glucocorticoid-resistant (ALL) cells, and identify common and unique coregulators for different cell line comparisons. Overall, we identify SRC-1/2/3, PGC-1alpha, RIP140 and DAX-1 as the strongest interacting coregulators of GR in MM and ALL cells and show that the interaction strength does not correlate with GR protein levels. Lastly, as a step towards patient samples, we determine the GR coregulator profile of peripheral blood mononuclear cells. We profile the interactions between GR and coregulators in MM and ALL cells and suggest to further explore the GR coregulator profile in hematological patient samples.","['Clarisse, Dorien', 'Thommis, Jonathan', 'Van Wesemael, Karlien', 'Houtman, Rene', 'Ratman, Dariusz', 'Tavernier, Jan', 'Offner, Fritz', 'Beck, Ilse', 'De Bosscher, Karolien']","['Clarisse D', 'Thommis J', 'Van Wesemael K', 'Houtman R', 'Ratman D', 'Tavernier J', 'Offner F', 'Beck I', 'De Bosscher K']","['Receptor Research Laboratories, Nuclear Receptor Lab (NRL) and Cytokine Receptor Lab (CRL), VIB-UGent Center for Medical Biotechnology, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Laboratory of Experimental Cancer Research (LECR), Department of Radiation Oncology and Experimental Cancer Research, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Cancer Research Institute Ghent (CRIG), Ghent, Belgium.', 'Receptor Research Laboratories, Nuclear Receptor Lab (NRL) and Cytokine Receptor Lab (CRL), VIB-UGent Center for Medical Biotechnology, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Laboratory of Experimental Cancer Research (LECR), Department of Radiation Oncology and Experimental Cancer Research, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium.', ""PamGene International B.V., 's Hertogenbosch, The Netherlands."", 'Receptor Research Laboratories, Nuclear Receptor Lab (NRL) and Cytokine Receptor Lab (CRL), VIB-UGent Center for Medical Biotechnology, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Current/Present address: Roche Global IT Solutions, Roche-Polska, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Receptor Research Laboratories, Nuclear Receptor Lab (NRL) and Cytokine Receptor Lab (CRL), VIB-UGent Center for Medical Biotechnology, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Cancer Research Institute Ghent (CRIG), Ghent, Belgium.', 'Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Laboratory of Experimental Cancer Research (LECR), Department of Radiation Oncology and Experimental Cancer Research, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Department of Health Sciences, Odisee University College, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Receptor Research Laboratories, Nuclear Receptor Lab (NRL) and Cytokine Receptor Lab (CRL), VIB-UGent Center for Medical Biotechnology, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Cancer Research Institute Ghent (CRIG), Ghent, Belgium.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20171130,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,PMC5752551,['NOTNLM'],"['acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'coregulator', 'glucocorticoid', 'glucocorticoid receptor', 'multiple myeloma']",2018/01/10 06:00,2018/01/10 06:01,['2018/01/10 06:00'],"['2017/09/16 00:00 [received]', '2017/11/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/01/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/10 06:01 [medline]']","['10.18632/oncotarget.22764 [doi]', '22764 [pii]']",epublish,Oncotarget. 2017 Nov 30;8(65):109675-109691. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.22764. eCollection 2017 Dec 12.,,65,,,,,,['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST The authors declare no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our previous study showed that matrine, an alkaloid extracted from a Chinese herb radix sophorae, significantly inhibited the proliferation of human CML K562cells, induced cell cycle arrest in G0/G1, and promoted cell apoptosis. In the present study, we investigated the molecular mechanism of matrine in the growth inhibition of leukemia cells using K562 and HL-60 cell lines. RT-PCR and Western blot assay demonstrated that the expression of BCR/ABL in K562 and HL-60 cells was significantly inhibited by matrine treatment. Phosphorylation of MEK1, ERK1/2, and their upstream adaptor molecules Shc and SHP2 were significantly downregulated. The protein and mRNA expression of components of the ERK/MAPK signal pathway, and Bcl-xL, Cyclin D1, and c-Myc, were dramatically reduced. Conversely, the expression of p27, a negative regulator of cell cycle progression, increased after matrine treatment. These results indicated that the inhibition of ERK/MAPK and BCR/ABL signaling pathway was associated with matrine's suppressive effects on the growth of K562 and HL-60 cells. In in vivo study, matrine significantly decreased the mortality rate of tumor-baring mice and suggested that matrine could exert its anti-leukemia effect in vivo.","['Ma, Lingdi', 'Xu, Zhenyu', 'Wang, Jian', 'Zhu, Zhichao', 'Lin, Guibin', 'Jiang, Lijia', 'Lu, Xuzhang', 'Zou, Chang']","['Ma L', 'Xu Z', 'Wang J', 'Zhu Z', 'Lin G', 'Jiang L', 'Lu X', 'Zou C']","[""Laboratory Center, The Third People's Hospital of Huizhou, Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Huizhou 516002, China."", 'Department of Pharmacy, Yijishan Affiliated Hospital of Wannan Medical College, Wuhu 241001, China.', ""Laboratory Center, The Third People's Hospital of Huizhou, Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Huizhou 516002, China."", ""Laboratory Center, The Second People's Hospital of Changzhou, Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Changzhou 213000, China."", ""Laboratory Center, The Third People's Hospital of Huizhou, Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Huizhou 516002, China."", ""Laboratory Center, The Second People's Hospital of Changzhou, Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Changzhou 213000, China."", ""Department of Hematology, The Second People's Hospital of Changzhou, Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Changzhou 213000, China."", ""Clinical Medical Research Center, The Second Clinical College of Jinan University, Shenzhen People's Hospital, Shenzhen 518020, China.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20171110,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,PMC5752489,['NOTNLM'],"['BCR/ABL', 'ERK/MAPK', 'K562 cells', 'chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML)', 'matrine']",2018/01/10 06:00,2018/01/10 06:01,['2018/01/10 06:00'],"['2016/08/20 00:00 [received]', '2017/06/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/01/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/10 06:01 [medline]']","['10.18632/oncotarget.22353 [doi]', '22353 [pii]']",epublish,Oncotarget. 2017 Nov 10;8(65):108880-108889. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.22353. eCollection 2017 Dec 12.,,65,,,,,,['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST None declared.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) have limited impact as single agents, failing to eradicate LIC in the bone marrow. Using primary AML samples and a patient-derived xenograft model, we investigated whether combining the FLT3-selective TKI crenolanib with the hypomethylating agent azacitidine (AZA) eliminates FLT3-ITD LIC and whether efficacy of this combination depends on co-existing mutations. Using multiparameter flow cytometry, we show FLT3-ITD occurs within the most primitive Lin(-)/CD33((+))/CD45(dim)/CD34(+)CD38(-) LIC compartment. Crenolanib alone could not target FLT3-ITD LIC in contact with niche cells while addition of AZA overcame stromal protection resulting in dramatically reduced clonogenic capacity of LIC in vitro and severely impaired engraftment in NSG mice. Strikingly, FLT3-mutated samples harboring TET2 mutations were completely resistant to crenolanib whereas neither NPM1 nor DNMT3A mutations influenced response. Conversely, primary AML LIC harboring either TET2, DNMT3A or NPM1 mutations did not show increased sensitivity to AZA. In summary, resistance of FLT3-ITD LIC to TKI depends on co-existing epigenetic mutations. However, AZA + crenolanib effectively abrogates stromal protection and inhibits survival of FLT3-ITD LIC irrespective of mutations, providing evidence for this combination as a means to suppress residual LIC.","['Garz, Anne-Kathrin', 'Wolf, Saskia', 'Grath, Sonja', 'Gaidzik, Verena', 'Habringer, Stefan', 'Vick, Binje', 'Rudelius, Martina', 'Ziegenhain, Christoph', 'Herold, Sylvia', 'Weickert, Marie-Theresa', 'Smets, Martha', 'Peschel, Christian', 'Oostendorp, Robert A J', 'Bultmann, Sebastian', 'Jeremias, Irmela', 'Thiede, Christian', 'Dohner, Konstanze', 'Keller, Ulrich', 'Gotze, Katharina S']","['Garz AK', 'Wolf S', 'Grath S', 'Gaidzik V', 'Habringer S', 'Vick B', 'Rudelius M', 'Ziegenhain C', 'Herold S', 'Weickert MT', 'Smets M', 'Peschel C', 'Oostendorp RAJ', 'Bultmann S', 'Jeremias I', 'Thiede C', 'Dohner K', 'Keller U', 'Gotze KS']","['Department of Medicine III, Klinikum rechts der Isar, Technische Universitat Munchen (TUM), Munich, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK) and German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine III, Klinikum rechts der Isar, Technische Universitat Munchen (TUM), Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Biology II, Ludwig-Maximilians-University (LMU), Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine III, Klinikum rechts der Isar, Technische Universitat Munchen (TUM), Munich, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK) and German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK) and German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, German Research Center for Environmental Health, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Pathology, Heinrich-Heine University Dusseldorf, Dusseldorf, Germany.', 'Department of Biology II, Ludwig-Maximilians-University (LMU), Munich, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK) and German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Gustav Carus University Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine III, Klinikum rechts der Isar, Technische Universitat Munchen (TUM), Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Biology II, Ludwig-Maximilians-University (LMU), Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine III, Klinikum rechts der Isar, Technische Universitat Munchen (TUM), Munich, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK) and German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine III, Klinikum rechts der Isar, Technische Universitat Munchen (TUM), Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Biology II, Ludwig-Maximilians-University (LMU), Munich, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK) and German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, German Research Center for Environmental Health, Munich, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK) and German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Gustav Carus University Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine III, Klinikum rechts der Isar, Technische Universitat Munchen (TUM), Munich, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK) and German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine III, Klinikum rechts der Isar, Technische Universitat Munchen (TUM), Munich, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK) and German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20171016,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,PMC5752477,['NOTNLM'],"['FLT3-ITD', 'TET2', 'azacitidine', 'crenolanib', 'leukemia-initiating cell (LIC)']",2018/01/10 06:00,2018/01/10 06:01,['2018/01/10 06:00'],"['2017/05/18 00:00 [received]', '2017/09/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/01/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/10 06:01 [medline]']","['10.18632/oncotarget.21877 [doi]', '21877 [pii]']",epublish,Oncotarget. 2017 Oct 16;8(65):108738-108759. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.21877. eCollection 2017 Dec 12.,,65,,,,,,"['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST KSG received honoraria from Celgene.

Here, we tested the hypothesis that in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), ATP release, along with its well-known immune stimulatory effect, may also contribute to the generation of an immune suppressive microenvironment. In a cohort of AML patients, undergoing combined daunorubicin and cytarabine chemotherapy, a population of T regulatory cells (Tregs) with suppressive phenotype, expressing the immune checkpoint programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), was significantly increased. Moving from these results, initial in vitro data showed that daunorubicin was more effective than cytarabine in modulating DC function toward Tregs induction and such difference was correlated with the higher capacity of daunorubicin to induce ATP release from treated AML cells. DCs cultured with daunorubicin-treated AML cells upregulated indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1), which induced anti-leukemia Tregs. These data were confirmed in vivo as daunorubicin-treated mice show an increase in extracellular ATP levels with increased number of Tregs, expressing PD-1 and IDO1(+)CD39(+) DCs. Notably, daunorubicin failed to induce Tregs and tolerogenic DCs in mice lacking the ATP receptor P2X7.

Although CAR T cell therapy has made remarkable strides in the treatment of patients with certain hematological cancers, in solid tumors success has been limited likely due to heterogeneous antigen expression, immunosuppressive networks in the tumor microenvironment limiting CAR T cell function and persistence, and suboptimal trafficking to solid tumors.

After a long latency, 3-5% of infected individuals will develop either a severe malignancy of CD4+ T cells, known as Adult T-cell Leukemia (ATL) or a chronic and progressive inflammatory disease of the nervous system designated Tropical Spastic Paraparesis/HTLV-1-Associated Myelopathy (HAM/TSP). The precise mechanism behind HTLV-1 pathogenesis still remains elusive. Two viral regulatory proteins, Tax-1 and HTLV-1 bZIP factor (HBZ) are thought to play a critical role in HTLV-1-associated diseases. Tax-1 is mainly involved in the onset of neoplastic transformation and in elicitation of the host's inflammatory responses; its expression may be lost during cell clonal proliferation and oncogenesis. Conversely, HBZ remains constantly expressed in all patients with ATL, playing a role in the proliferation and maintenance of leukemic cells. Recent studies have shown that the subcellular distribution of HBZ protein differs in the two pathologies: it is nuclear with a speckled-like pattern in leukemic cells and is cytoplasmic in cells from HAM/TSP patients. Thus, HBZ expression and distribution could be critical in the progression of HTLV-1 infection versus the leukemic state or the inflammatory disease. Here, we reviewed recent findings on the role of HBZ in HTLV-1 related diseases, highlighting the new perspectives open by the possibility of studying the physiologic expression of endogenous protein in primary infected cells.","['Baratella, Marco', 'Forlani, Greta', 'Accolla, Roberto S']","['Baratella M', 'Forlani G', 'Accolla RS']","['Laboratories of General Pathology and Immunology ""Giovanna Tosi"", Department of Medicine and Surgery, School of Medicine, University of Insubria, Varese, Italy.', 'Laboratories of General Pathology and Immunology ""Giovanna Tosi"", Department of Medicine and Surgery, School of Medicine, University of Insubria, Varese, Italy.', 'Laboratories of General Pathology and Immunology ""Giovanna Tosi"", Department of Medicine and Surgery, School of Medicine, University of Insubria, Varese, Italy.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20171222,Switzerland,Front Microbiol,Frontiers in microbiology,101548977,PMC5744428,['NOTNLM'],"['ATL', 'HAM/TSP', 'HBZ', 'HTLV-1', 'Tax-1']",2018/01/10 06:00,2018/01/10 06:01,['2018/01/10 06:00'],"['2017/11/07 00:00 [received]', '2017/12/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/01/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/10 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fmicb.2017.02615 [doi]'],epublish,Front Microbiol. 2017 Dec 22;8:2615. doi: 10.3389/fmicb.2017.02615. eCollection 2017.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Increased HTLV-1 Tax expression induces the expression of various cellular genes such as IL-2 and IL-15, which directly contributes to lymphocyte activation and immunopathogenesis in HAM/TSP patients. However, little is known about the molecular and cellular mechanism of HBZ in development of HAM/TSP. It has been reported that HBZ mRNA expression was detected in HAM/TSP patients higher than in asymptomatic carriers and correlated with proviral load and disease severity. Unlike HTLV-1 tax, HBZ escapes efficient anti-viral immune responses and therefore these reactivities are difficult to detect. Thus, it is important to focus on understanding the function and the role of HTLV-1 tax and HBZ in disease development of HAM/TSP and discuss the potential use of these HTLV-1 viral gene products as biomarkers and therapeutic targets for HAM/TSP.","['Enose-Akahata, Yoshimi', 'Vellucci, Ashley', 'Jacobson, Steven']","['Enose-Akahata Y', 'Vellucci A', 'Jacobson S']","['Viral Immunology Section, Division of Neuroimmunology and Neurovirology, National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, United States.', 'Viral Immunology Section, Division of Neuroimmunology and Neurovirology, National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, United States.', 'Viral Immunology Section, Division of Neuroimmunology and Neurovirology, National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, United States.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20171221,Switzerland,Front Microbiol,Frontiers in microbiology,101548977,PMC5742587,['NOTNLM'],"['HAM/TSP', 'HBZ', 'HTLV-1', 'Tax', 'neuroinflammatory disease']",2018/01/10 06:00,2018/01/10 06:01,['2018/01/10 06:00'],"['2017/10/17 00:00 [received]', '2017/12/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/01/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/10 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fmicb.2017.02563 [doi]'],epublish,Front Microbiol. 2017 Dec 21;8:2563. doi: 10.3389/fmicb.2017.02563. eCollection 2017.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, to date, the monitoring of the inflammatory response to detect secondary complications such as DCI has not become part of the clinical routine diagnostic. Here, we aim to illustrate the time courses of inflammatory parameters after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) and discuss the problems of inflammatory parameters as biomarkers but also their possible relevance for deeper understanding of the pathophysiology after aSAH and sophisticated planning of future studies. Materials and methods: In this prospective cohort study, 109 patients with aSAH were initially included, n = 28 patients had to be excluded. Serum and-if possible-cerebral spinal fluid samples (n = 48) were retrieved at days 1, 4, 7, 10, and 14 after aSAH. Samples were analyzed for leukocyte count and C-reactive protein (CRP) (serum samples only) as well as matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP9), intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM1), and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) [both serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples]. Time courses of the inflammatory parameters were displayed and related to the occurrence of DCI. Results: We illustrate the time courses of leukocyte count, CRP, MMP9, ICAM1, and LIF in patients' serum samples from the first until the 14th day after aSAH. Time courses of MMP9, ICAM1, and LIF in CSF samples are demonstrated. Furthermore, no significant difference was shown relating the time courses to the occurrence of DCI. Conclusion: We estimate that the wide range of the measured values hampers their interpretation and usage as a biomarker. However, understanding the inflammatory response after aSAH and generating a multicenter database may facilitate further studies: realistic sample size calculations on the basis of a multicenter database will increase the quality and clinical relevance of the acquired results.","['Hollig, Anke', 'Stoffel-Wagner, Birgit', 'Clusmann, Hans', 'Veldeman, Michael', 'Schubert, Gerrit A', 'Coburn, Mark']","['Hollig A', 'Stoffel-Wagner B', 'Clusmann H', 'Veldeman M', 'Schubert GA', 'Coburn M']","['Department of Neurosurgery, University Hospital RWTH Aachen, Aachen, Germany.', 'Department of Clinical Chemistry and Clinical Pharmacology, University Hospital Bonn, Bonn, Germany.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, University Hospital RWTH Aachen, Aachen, Germany.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, University Hospital RWTH Aachen, Aachen, Germany.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, University Hospital RWTH Aachen, Aachen, Germany.', 'Department of Anesthesiology, University Hospital RWTH Aachen, Aachen, Germany.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20171222,Switzerland,Front Neurol,Frontiers in neurology,101546899,PMC5744005,['NOTNLM'],"['delayed cerebral ischemia', 'early brain injury', 'inflammatory response', 'observational research', 'subarachnoid hemorrhage']",2018/01/10 06:00,2018/01/10 06:01,['2018/01/10 06:00'],"['2017/07/20 00:00 [received]', '2017/12/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/01/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/10 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fneur.2017.00694 [doi]'],epublish,Front Neurol. 2017 Dec 22;8:694. doi: 10.3389/fneur.2017.00694. eCollection 2017.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mature red blood cells are generated from multipotent hematopoietic stem cells, through a complex maturation process involving several morphological changes to produce a highly functional specialized cells. In mammals, terminal steps involved expulsion of the nucleus from erythroblasts that leads to the formation of reticulocytes. In order to produce mature biconcave red blood cells, organelles and ribosomes are selectively eliminated from reticulocytes as well as the plasma membrane undergoes remodeling. The mechanisms involved in these last maturation steps are still under investigation. Enucleation involves dramatic chromatin condensation and establishment of the nuclear polarity, which is driven by a rearrangement of actin cytoskeleton and the clathrin-dependent generation of vacuoles at the nuclear-cytoplasmic junction. This process is favored by interaction between the erythroblasts and macrophages at the erythroblastic island. Mitochondria are eliminated by mitophagy. This is a macroautophagy pathway consisting in the engulfment of mitochondria into a double-membrane structure called autophagosome before degradation. Several mice knock-out models were developed to identify mitophagy-involved proteins during erythropoiesis, but whole mechanisms are not completely determined. Less is known concerning the clearance of other organelles, such as smooth and rough ER, Golgi apparatus and ribosomes. Understanding the modulators of organelles clearance in erythropoiesis may elucidate the pathogenesis of different dyserythropoietic diseases such as myelodysplastic syndrome, leukemia and anemia.","['Moras, Martina', 'Lefevre, Sophie D', 'Ostuni, Mariano A']","['Moras M', 'Lefevre SD', 'Ostuni MA']","[""UMR-S1134 Integrated Biology of Red Blood Cell, INSERM, Universite Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Institut National de la Transfusion Sanguine, Laboratoire d'Excellence GR-Ex, Paris, France."", ""UMR-S1134 Integrated Biology of Red Blood Cell, INSERM, Universite Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Institut National de la Transfusion Sanguine, Laboratoire d'Excellence GR-Ex, Paris, France."", ""UMR-S1134 Integrated Biology of Red Blood Cell, INSERM, Universite Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Institut National de la Transfusion Sanguine, Laboratoire d'Excellence GR-Ex, Paris, France.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20171219,Switzerland,Front Physiol,Frontiers in physiology,101549006,PMC5742207,['NOTNLM'],"['enucleation', 'erythroblast maturation', 'erythropoiesis', 'mitophagy', 'organelle clearance', 'reticulocytes']",2018/01/10 06:00,2018/01/10 06:01,['2018/01/10 06:00'],"['2017/10/11 00:00 [received]', '2017/12/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/01/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/10 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fphys.2017.01076 [doi]'],epublish,Front Physiol. 2017 Dec 19;8:1076. doi: 10.3389/fphys.2017.01076. eCollection 2017.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MM is almost always preceded by monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), and at least a quarter of all patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) have disease that evolves into AML. In turn, MDS are frequently anteceded by clonal haematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP). The acquisition of additional genetic and epigenetic alterations over time clearly influences the increasingly unstable and aggressive behaviour of neoplastic haematopoietic clones; however, perturbations in the bone-marrow microenvironment are increasingly recognized to have key roles in initiating and supporting oncogenesis. In this Review, we focus on the concept that the haematopoietic neoplasia-microenvironment relationship is an intimate rapport between two partners, provide an overview of the evidence supporting a role for the bone-marrow niche in promoting neoplasia, and discuss the potential for niche-specific therapeutic targets.","['Ghobrial, Irene M', 'Detappe, Alexandre', 'Anderson, Kenneth C', 'Steensma, David P']","['Ghobrial IM', 'Detappe A', 'Anderson KC', 'Steensma DP']","['Division of Hematological Malignancies, Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, 450 Brookline Avenue, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA.', 'Division of Hematological Malignancies, Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, 450 Brookline Avenue, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA.', 'Division of Hematological Malignancies, Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, 450 Brookline Avenue, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA.', 'Division of Hematological Malignancies, Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, 450 Brookline Avenue, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",20180109,England,Nat Rev Clin Oncol,Nature reviews.

Recombinant immunotoxins are proteins that are very effective in patients with leukemia, where immunity is suppressed, but induce ADAs, which compromise their activity, in patients with intact immunity. Here we induced a specific, durable, and transferable immune tolerance to recombinant immunotoxins by combining them with nanoparticles containing rapamycin (SVP-R). SVP-R mitigated the formation of inhibitory ADAs in naive and sensitized mice, resulting in restoration of antitumor activity. The immune tolerance is mediated by colocalization of the SVP-R and immunotoxin to dendritic cells and macrophages in the spleen and is abrogated by depletion of regulatory T cells. Tolerance induced by SVPs was not blocked by checkpoint inhibitors or costimulatory agonist monoclonal antibodies that by themselves enhance ADA formation.","['Mazor, Ronit', 'King, Emily M', 'Onda, Masanori', 'Cuburu, Nicolas', 'Addissie, Selamawit', 'Crown, Devorah', 'Liu, Xiu-Fen', 'Kishimoto, Takashi Kei', 'Pastan, Ira']","['Mazor R', 'King EM', 'Onda M', 'Cuburu N', 'Addissie S', 'Crown D', 'Liu XF', 'Kishimoto TK', 'Pastan I']","['Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892.', 'Laboratory of Cellular Oncology, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892.', 'Leidos Biomedical Research, Inc., National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892.', 'Selecta Biosciences, Watertown, MA 02472.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892; pastani@mail.nih.gov.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20180108,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,PMC5789939,['NOTNLM'],"['*antidrug antibodies', '*cancer', '*mesothelin', '*nanoparticle', '*rapamycin']",2018/01/10 06:00,2018/07/19 06:00,['2018/01/10 06:00'],"['2018/01/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/07/19 06:00 [medline]', '2018/01/10 06:00 [entrez]']","['1717063115 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1717063115 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2018 Jan 23;115(4):E733-E742. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1717063115.

In this study, avirulent strain C. burnetii Nine Mile phase II (NMII) was used to examine if C. burnetii can modulate mouse bone marrow-derived neutrophil apoptosis. The results indicated that NMII can inhibit neutrophil apoptosis. Western blotting demonstrated that caspase-3 cleavage was decreased in NMII-infected neutrophils, while phosphorylated mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) p38 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 (Erk1) were increased. Additionally, p38, Erk1/2, phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), or NF-kappaB inhibitors reduced the ability of NMII to inhibit neutrophil apoptosis. These results suggest that NMII-mediated inhibition of neutrophil apoptosis depends on its ability to activate neutrophil MAPK pathways. Antiapoptotic protein myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1) was significantly increased in NMII-infected neutrophils, and an Mcl-1 inhibitor significantly reduced the ability of NMII to inhibit neutrophil apoptosis. Mcl-1 protein stability was enhanced by phosphorylation at Thr-163 by Erk, and the protein levels were regulated by p38, Erk, PI3K, and NF-kappaB. Furthermore, the observation that a type IV secretion system (T4SS)-deficient dotA mutant showed a significantly reduced ability to inhibit neutrophil apoptosis compared to wild-type (WT) NMII suggests that T4SS-secreted factors may be involved in NMII-induced inhibition of neutrophil apoptosis. Collectively, these results demonstrate that NMII inhibits neutrophil apoptosis through inhibition of caspase-3 cleavage and activation of MAPK survival pathways with subsequent expression and stabilization of antiapoptotic protein Mcl-1, a process that may partially require the T4SS.","['Cherla, Rama', 'Zhang, Yan', 'Ledbetter, Lindsey', 'Zhang, Guoquan']","['Cherla R', 'Zhang Y', 'Ledbetter L', 'Zhang G']","['Department of Veterinary Pathobiology, College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Missouri-Columbia, Columbia, Missouri, USA.', 'Department of Veterinary Pathobiology, College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Missouri-Columbia, Columbia, Missouri, USA.', 'Department of Veterinary Pathobiology, College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Missouri-Columbia, Columbia, Missouri, USA.', 'Department of Veterinary Pathobiology, College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Missouri-Columbia, Columbia, Missouri, USA zhangguo@missouri.edu.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20180322,United States,Infect Immun,Infection and immunity,0246127,PMC5865014,['NOTNLM'],"['*Coxiella burnetii', '*Mcl-1', '*NF-kappaB', '*PI3K', '*apoptosis', '*caspase-3', '*neutrophils']",2018/01/10 06:00,2018/11/15 06:00,['2018/01/10 06:00'],"['2017/07/14 00:00 [received]', '2017/12/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/11/15 06:00 [medline]', '2018/01/10 06:00 [entrez]']","['IAI.00504-17 [pii]', '10.1128/IAI.00504-17 [doi]']",epublish,Infect Immun. 2018 Mar 22;86(4). pii: IAI.00504-17. doi: 10.1128/IAI.00504-17.

Online searches reflect public awareness, which could be driven by the underlying regional cancer epidemiology. OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study was to characterize the relationship between cancer incidence and online Google search volumes in the United States for 6 common cancers. A secondary objective was to evaluate the association of search activity with cancer-related public events and celebrity news coverage. METHODS: We performed a population-based, retrospective study of state-level cancer incidence from 2004 through 2013 reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for breast, prostate, colon, lung, and uterine cancers and leukemia compared to Google Trends (GT) relative search volume (RSV), a metric designed by Google to allow interest in search topics to be compared between regions. Participants included persons in the United States who searched for cancer terms on Google. The primary measures were the correlation between annual state-level cancer incidence and RSV as determined by Spearman correlation and linear regression with RSV and year as independent variables and cancer incidence as the dependent variable. Temporal associations between search activity and events raising public awareness such as cancer awareness months and cancer-related celebrity news were described. RESULTS: At the state level, RSV was significantly correlated to incidence for breast (r=.18, P=.001), prostate (r=-.27, P<.001), lung (r=.33, P<.001), and uterine cancers (r=.39, P<.001) and leukemia (r=.13, P=.003) but not colon cancer (r=-.02, P=.66). After adjusting for time, state-level RSV was positively correlated to cancer incidence for all cancers: breast (P<.001, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.19), prostate (P=.38, 95% CI -0.08 to 0.22), lung (P<.001, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.46), colon (P<.001, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.17), and uterine cancers (P<.001, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.12) and leukemia (P<.001, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.03). Temporal associations in GT were noted with breast cancer awareness month but not with other cancer awareness months and celebrity events. CONCLUSIONS: Cancer incidence is correlated with online search volume at the state level. Search patterns were temporally associated with cancer awareness months and celebrity announcements. Online searches reflect public awareness. Advancing understanding of online search patterns could augment traditional epidemiologic surveillance, provide opportunities for targeted patient engagement, and allow public information campaigns to be evaluated in ways previously unable to be measured.","['Phillips, Charles A', 'Barz Leahy, Allison', 'Li, Yimei', 'Schapira, Marilyn M', 'Bailey, L Charles', 'Merchant, Raina M']","['Phillips CA', 'Barz Leahy A', 'Li Y', 'Schapira MM', 'Bailey LC', 'Merchant RM']","[""Division of Oncology and Center for Childhood Cancer Research, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, United States."", ""Division of Oncology and Center for Childhood Cancer Research, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, United States."", ""Division of Oncology and Center for Childhood Cancer Research, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, United States."", 'Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology and Informatics, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, United States.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, United States.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, United States.', 'Center for Health Equity Research and Promotion, Philadelphia Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Philadelphia, PA, United States.', ""Division of Oncology and Center for Childhood Cancer Research, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, United States."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, United States.', ""Department of Biomedical and Health Informatics, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA, United States."", 'Penn Medicine Center for Digital Health, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, United States.', 'Department of Emergency Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, United States.']",['eng'],"['P30 CA016520/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 HD060550/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180108,Canada,J Med Internet Res,Journal of medical Internet research,100959882,PMC5778251,['NOTNLM'],"['*Google', '*Internet', '*cancer', '*incidence', '*infodemiology']",2018/01/10 06:00,2019/04/23 06:00,['2018/01/10 06:00'],"['2017/08/30 00:00 [received]', '2017/10/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/10/18 00:00 [revised]', '2018/01/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/01/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/23 06:00 [medline]']","['v20i1e6 [pii]', '10.2196/jmir.8870 [doi]']",epublish,J Med Internet Res. 2018 Jan 8;20(1):e6. doi: 10.2196/jmir.8870.,20190422,1,,IM,"['Awareness', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Internet/*standards', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Search Engine/*methods', 'United States']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-0391-1673', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1368-4064', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9067-6992', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3775-9462', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8967-0662', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9801-6881']","['(c)Charles A.

It is essential for the survival of normal and malignant B lymphocytes. Increased expression of APRIL is noted in most of hematological malignancies and auto immune diseases. We investigated the expression level of APRIL mRNA in 50 de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients, together with 20 healthy controls using a Real-Time Quantitative Reverse-Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (RTQ-PCR) with a specific aim of determining its relation to clinical features and laboratory findings at diagnosis and its impact on the response to therapy. APRIL mRNA expression level was significantly higher in AML patients than in controls (p = < 0.001). APRIL expression level was significantly higher in patients who didn't achieve CR compared to those who achieved CR (p < 0.001). Patients who did not achieve CR also had higher TLC, lower platelets and older age than CR patients. The difference was statistically significant (p < 0.001, p = 0.047, p = 0.019) respectively. APRIL levels showed significant positive correlation with TLC (r = 0.743.p < 0.001), with age (r = 0.296,p = 0.037) and a negative correlation with platelets count (r = -0.443,p = 0.001) and no correlation with gender, Hb level, BM blast, HSM or LNs enlargement. Our study has shown that APRIL is overexpressed in AML patients, its level might serve as an indicator for disease progression. APRIL might be an indicator for poor prognosis and treatment resistance in AML patient; therefore, APRIL antagonists may represent a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of AML.","['Hammam, Amira Ahmed', 'Elhoseiny, Shereen Mohamed', 'Sheir, Rania El-Sayed', 'Issa, Hisham']","['Hammam AA', 'Elhoseiny SM', 'Sheir RE', 'Issa H']","['Department of Clinical and Chemical Pathology, Beni Suef Teaching Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, Beni Suef University, Egypt.', 'Department of Clinical and Chemical Pathology, Beni Suef Teaching Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, Beni Suef University, Egypt.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Beni Suef Teaching Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, Beni Suef University, Egypt.', 'Department of Clinical and Chemical Pathology, Beni Suef Teaching Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, Beni Suef University, Egypt.

The SU or surface subunit, gp51, of its envelope glycoprotein is involved in receptor recognition and virion attachment. It contains the major neutralizing and CD4+ and CD8+ T cell epitopes found in naturally infected animals. In this study, we aimed to determine global variation and conservation within gp51 in the context of developing an effective global BLV vaccine. RESULTS: A total of 256 sequences extracted from the NCBI database and collected in different parts of the world, were studied to identify conserved segments along the env gene sequences that encode the gp51 protein. Using the MEME server and the conserved DNA Region module for analysis within DnaSP, we identified six conserved segments, referred to as A-F, and five semi-conserved segments, referred to as G-K. The amino acid conservation ranged from 98.8 to 99.8% in conserved segments A to F, while segments G to K had 89.6-95.2% conserved amino acid sequence. Selection analysis of individual segments revealed that residues of conserved segments had undergone purifying selection, whereas, particular residues in the semi-conserved segments are currently undergoing positive selection, specifically at amino acid positions 48 in segment K, 74 in segment G, 82 in segment I, 133 and 142 in segment J, and residue 291 in segment H. Each of the codons for these six residues contain the most highly variable nucleotides within their respective semi-conserved segments. CONCLUSIONS: The data described here show that the consensus amino acid sequence constitutes a strong candidate from which a global vaccine can be derived for use in countries where eradication by culling is not economically feasible. The most conserved segments overlap with amino acids in known immunodeterminants, specifically in epitopes D-D', E-E', CD8+ T-cell epitopes, neutralizing domain 1 and CD4+ T-cell epitopes. Two of the segments reported here represent unique segments that do not overlap with previously identified antigenic determinants. We propose that evidence of positive selection in some residues of the semi-conserved segments suggests that their variation is involved in viral strategy to escape immune surveillance of the host.","['Pluta, Aneta', 'Albritton, Lorraine M', 'Rola-Luszczak, Marzena', 'Kuzmak, Jacek']","['Pluta A', 'Albritton LM', 'Rola-Luszczak M', 'Kuzmak J']","['OIE Reference Laboratory for EBL, Department of Biochemistry, National Veterinary Research Institute, Pulawy, Poland. aneta.pluta@piwet.pulawy.pl.', 'Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Biochemistry, College of Medicine, The University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, TN, USA.', 'OIE Reference Laboratory for EBL, Department of Biochemistry, National Veterinary Research Institute, Pulawy, Poland.', 'OIE Reference Laboratory for EBL, Department of Biochemistry, National Veterinary Research Institute, Pulawy, Poland.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20180108,England,Retrovirology,Retrovirology,101216893,PMC5759284,['NOTNLM'],"['Antigenic determinants', 'BLV', 'Conserved segments', 'Deltaretrovirus', 'Env', 'Genetic variability', 'MEME', 'Positive selection']",2018/01/10 06:00,2018/11/28 06:00,['2018/01/10 06:00'],"['2017/09/12 00:00 [received]', '2017/12/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/01/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/11/28 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12977-017-0383-0 [doi]', '10.1186/s12977-017-0383-0 [pii]']",epublish,Retrovirology. 2018 Jan 8;15(1):2. doi: 10.1186/s12977-017-0383-0.,20181127,1,"['0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Epitopes, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Motifs/*genetics/immunology', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cattle', 'Computational Biology', 'Conserved Sequence', 'Enzootic Bovine Leukosis/virology', 'Epitopes/chemistry/genetics/immunology', 'Epitopes, B-Lymphocyte', 'Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte', 'Genes, env/*genetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/chemistry/*genetics', 'Models, Molecular', 'Selection, Genetic', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*chemistry/*genetics/immunology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Clustering presents two main challenges: (1) finding the optimal number of clusters, and (2) removing ""outliers"" among the objects being clustered. Few clustering algorithms currently deal directly with the outlier problem. Furthermore, existing methods for identifying the number of clusters still have some drawbacks. Thus, there is a need for a better algorithm to tackle both challenges. RESULTS: We present a new approach, implemented in an R package called Thresher, to cluster objects in general datasets. Thresher combines ideas from principal component analysis, outlier filtering, and von Mises-Fisher mixture models in order to select the optimal number of clusters. We performed a large Monte Carlo simulation study to compare Thresher with other methods for detecting outliers and determining the number of clusters. We found that Thresher had good sensitivity and specificity for detecting and removing outliers. We also found that Thresher is the best method for estimating the optimal number of clusters when the number of objects being clustered is smaller than the number of variables used for clustering. Finally, we applied Thresher and eleven other methods to 25 sets of breast cancer data downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus; only Thresher consistently estimated the number of clusters to lie in the range of 4-7 that is consistent with the literature. CONCLUSIONS: Thresher is effective at automatically detecting and removing outliers. By thus cleaning the data, it produces better estimates of the optimal number of clusters when there are more variables than objects. When we applied Thresher to a variety of breast cancer datasets, it produced estimates that were both self-consistent and consistent with the literature. We expect Thresher to be useful for studying a wide variety of biological datasets.","['Wang, Min', 'Abrams, Zachary B', 'Kornblau, Steven M', 'Coombes, Kevin R']","['Wang M', 'Abrams ZB', 'Kornblau SM', 'Coombes KR']","['Department of Biomedical Informatics, The Ohio State University, 250 Lincoln Tower, 1800 Cannon Drive, Columbus, 43210, OH, USA.', 'Mathematical Biosciences Institute, The Ohio State University, 1735 Neil Avenue, Columbus, 43210, OH, USA.', 'Department of Biomedical Informatics, The Ohio State University, 250 Lincoln Tower, 1800 Cannon Drive, Columbus, 43210, OH, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Blvd., Box 448, Houston, 77030, TX, USA.', 'Department of Biomedical Informatics, The Ohio State University, 250 Lincoln Tower, 1800 Cannon Drive, Columbus, 43210, OH, USA. coombes.3@osu.edu.']",['eng'],"['P50 CA168505/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA070907/NIH/NCI/International', 'P30 CA016058/NIH/NCI/International', 'P50 CA168505/NIH/NCI/International', 'P30 CA016058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA070907/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DMS-1440386/National Science Foundation/International', 'R01 CA182905/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T15 LM011270/LM/NLM NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA182905/NIH/NCI/International']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20180108,England,BMC Bioinformatics,BMC bioinformatics,100965194,PMC5759208,['NOTNLM'],"['*Clustering', '*Gap statistics', '*NbClust', '*Number of clusters', '*SCOD', '*Silhouette width', '*von Mises-Fisher mixture model']",2018/01/10 06:00,2018/11/07 06:00,['2018/01/10 06:00'],"['2017/04/07 00:00 [received]', '2017/12/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/01/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/11/07 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12859-017-1998-9 [doi]', '10.1186/s12859-017-1998-9 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Bioinformatics. 2018 Jan 8;19(1):9. doi: 10.1186/s12859-017-1998-9.,20181106,1,,IM,"['Algorithms', 'Breast Neoplasms/metabolism/pathology', '*Cluster Analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Principal Component Analysis']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Secondary endpoints were number of documented infections and in-hospital mortality in patients who develop febrile neutropenia. METHODS: A single-center retrospective cohort analysis at a large tertiary care academic medical center was conducted. This study included adult acute leukemia patients (age >/=18 years old) who received inpatient antibacterial prophylaxis (moxifloxacin or levofloxacin) from 1 July 2012 to 1 October 2014. Patients were excluded from the study if they were treated with antimicrobial therapy in the preceding five days or admitted to the hospital with neutropenic fever. Fisher's exact test was used for categorical data and Mann-Whitney test for continuous data. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine risk factors for febrile neutropenia. RESULTS: Eighty-five patients were included in the final analysis with 40 patients who received moxifloxacin and 45 patients who received levofloxacin. Baseline characteristics were similar between the two groups. Twenty-two patients experienced febrile neutropenia requiring intravenous antibiotics in the moxifloxacin group and 30 patients in the levofloxacin group (P = 0.190). Age and duration of neutropenia appeared to predict for febrile neutropenia; however, after multivariate analysis, longer duration of neutropenia was shown to be the best predictor for febrile neutropenia with an odds ratio of 4.69 (95% CI, 1.697-12.968). Both groups had similar rates of documented infections and in-hospital morality. CONCLUSION: Moxifloxacin and levofloxacin showed similar rates of febrile neutropenia when used for neutropenic antibacterial prophylaxis in acute leukemia patients.","['Lee, Pauline', 'Knoebel, Randall W', 'Pisano, Jennifer', 'Pettit, Natasha N']","['Lee P', 'Knoebel RW', 'Pisano J', 'Pettit NN']","['University of Chicago Medicine, Chicago, USA.', 'University of Chicago Medicine, Chicago, USA.', 'University of Chicago Medicine, Chicago, USA.', 'University of Chicago Medicine, Chicago, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20180108,England,J Oncol Pharm Pract,Journal of oncology pharmacy practice : official publication of the International Society of Oncology Pharmacy Practitioners,9511372,,['NOTNLM'],"['Moxifloxacin', 'acute leukemia', 'fever', 'levofloxacin', 'neutropenic']",2018/01/10 06:00,2019/04/25 06:00,['2018/01/10 06:00'],"['2018/01/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/25 06:00 [medline]', '2018/01/10 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/1078155217752074 [doi]'],ppublish,J Oncol Pharm Pract. 2019 Apr;25(3):758-761. doi: 10.1177/1078155217752074.

Recently, some single-group studies have suggested that adding rituximab to chemotherapy can improve the outcome of CD20-positive B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients. Areas covered: An overview of the current insights of rituximab in adult ALL patients is presented here. In particular, we focused on results of multicenter randomized phase III trial (GRAALL-2005 - Group for Research on Adult Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia) that evaluated the benefit of associating rituximab to chemotherapy in Ph-negative, B-lineage ALL expressing the CD20 antigen. Expert opinion: Data from clinical trials confirm that rituximab enhances the efficacy of chemotherapy without additive toxicity in ALL. However, results of GRAAL 2005 study represent only a modest incremental improvement in the treatment of ALL. Other promising compounds as single agent or in combination with chemotherapy are currently in different stages of clinical development. The GRAALL 2005 study sets the stage for other prospective studies which will further elucidate the role of monoclonal antibodies in the management of ALL.","['Levato, Luciano', 'Molica, Stefano']","['Levato L', 'Molica S']","['a Department Hematology-Oncology , Azienda Ospedaliera Pugliese-Ciaccio , Catanzaro , Italy.', 'a Department Hematology-Oncology , Azienda Ospedaliera Pugliese-Ciaccio , Catanzaro , Italy.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20180117,England,Expert Opin Biol Ther,Expert opinion on biological therapy,101125414,,['NOTNLM'],"['*CD20 monoclonal antibodies', '*acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*minimal residual disease', '*rituximab']",2018/01/10 06:00,2018/10/17 06:00,['2018/01/10 06:00'],"['2018/01/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/17 06:00 [medline]', '2018/01/10 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/14712598.2018.1425389 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Biol Ther. 2018 Feb;18(2):221-226. doi: 10.1080/14712598.2018.1425389.

We analyzed parameters derived from Sysmex(TM) XN analyzers to improve the management of microscopic examination for monocytosis. We analyzed results of the complete blood count and the positioning and dispersion parameters of polymorphonuclear neutrophils and monocytes in 61 patients presenting with CMML and 635 control patients presenting with a reactive monocytosis. We used logistic regression and multivariate analysis to define a score for smear review. Three parameters were selected: neutrophil/monocyte ratio, structural neutrophil dispersion (Ne-WX) and monocyte absolute value. We established an equation in which the threshold of 0.160 guided microscopic examination in the search for CMML abnormalities with a sensitivity of 0.967 and a specificity of 0.978 in the learning cohort (696 samples) and 0.923 and 0.936 in the validation cohort (1809 samples) respectively.

However, the molecular events underlying leukemia development are not well understood. In our recent study, we have demonstrated that calcium ionophore and phorbol ester force the differentiation of T lymphoblastic leukemia. The event involves a newly identified IkappaBalpha/WWOX/ERK signaling, in which WWOX is Ser14 phosphorylated. Additional evidence also reveals that pS14-WWOX is involved in enhancing cancer progression and metastasis and facilitating neurodegeneration. In this mini-review, we update the current knowledge for the functional roles of WWOX under physiological and pathological settings, and provide new insights regarding pS14-WWOX in T leukemia cell maturation, and switching the anticancer pY33-WWOX to pS14-WWOX for cancer promotion and disease progression. Impact statement WWOX was originally designated as a tumor suppressor. However, human newborns deficient in WWOX do not spontaneously develop tumors. Activated WWOX with Tyr33 phosphorylation is present in normal tissues and organs. However, when pY33-WWOX is overly induced under stress conditions, it becomes apoptotic to eliminate damaged cells. Notably, WWOX with Ser14 phosphorylation is upregulated in the lesions of cancer, as well as in the brain hippocampus and cortex with Alzheimer's disease. Suppression of pS14-WWOX by Zfra reduces cancer growth and mitigates Alzheimer's disease progression, suggesting that pS14-WWOX facilitates disease progression. pS14-WWOX can be regarded as a marker of disease progression.","['Huang, Shenq-Shyang', 'Chang, Nan-Shan']","['Huang SS', 'Chang NS']","['1 Institute of Molecular Medicine, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan 70101, Taiwan, ROC.', '2 Graduate Program of Biotechnology in Medicine, Institute of Molecular and Cellular Biology, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu 30013, Taiwan, ROC.', '1 Institute of Molecular Medicine, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan 70101, Taiwan, ROC.', '3 Department of Neurochemistry, New York State Institute for Basic Research in Developmental Disabilities, Staten Island, NY 10314, USA.', '4 Graduate Institute of Biomedical Sciences, College of Medicine, China Medical University, Taichung 40402, Taiwan, ROC.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", 'Review']",20180108,England,Exp Biol Med (Maywood),"Experimental biology and medicine (Maywood, N.J.)",100973463,PMC5788152,['NOTNLM'],"['*WWOX', '*apoptosis', '*bubbling cell death', '*cancer', '*neurodegeneration', '*phosphorylation']",2018/01/10 06:00,2018/09/05 06:00,['2018/01/10 06:00'],"['2018/01/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/09/05 06:00 [medline]', '2018/01/10 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/1535370217752350 [doi]'],ppublish,Exp Biol Med (Maywood). 2018 Jan;243(2):137-147. doi: 10.1177/1535370217752350.

Although these AMLs are categorized as favorable risk by NCCN, clinical experience suggests that there are differences in clinical outcome amongst these cytogenetically and molecularly distinct leukemias. This study compared clinical and genotypic characteristics of 60 patients with favorable-risk AML, excluding APL, and demonstrated significant differences between them. Patients with NPM1(mut) AML were significantly older than those in the other groups. Targeted next-generation sequencing on DNA from peripheral blood or bone marrow revealed significantly more mutations in NPM1(mut) AML than the other favorable-risk diseases, especially in genes related to DNA splicing and methylation. CEBPA(mut/mut) AMLs exhibited more mutations in transcription-related genes. Patients with NPM1(mut) AML and CEBPA(mut/mut) AML show significantly reduced overall survival in comparison with CBF-KIT(wt) AML.

In the present study, we aimed to investigate the effects of combinational of a classic anticancer agent paclitaxel and antidiabetic agent metformin on HL-60 APL cell line. The combination dose of paclitaxel and metformin was determined by WST-1 analysis. The effect of combinational dose on apoptosis was assessed in fluorescence microscope after using AnnexinV-EGFP Apoptosis and JC-1 Assay Kit. The effect of combinational dose on cell cycle, apoptosis and differentiation, and signaling pathways were determined investigating gene expression changes by using real time qRT-PCR. The combinational dose of paclitaxel and metformin was determined as 4.8nM and 398.7muM for 72h, respectively. The combination dose significantly increased apoptosis for 48h. In expression changes of genes associated cell cycle, apoptosis, cytokines, co-stimulator molecules, NF-kB and MAP/MAPK pathways, TLRs (Toll-like receptors) were found to be decreased or increased to provide apoptosis or differentiation. Consequently, we suggest that the combination of paclitaxel and metformin can be used as an option assessable for development of new treatment strategies for APL.","['Asik, Aycan', 'Kayabasi, Cagla', 'Ozmen Yelken, Besra', 'Yilmaz Susluer, Sunde', 'Dogan Sigva, Zeynep Ozlem', 'Balci Okcanoglu, Tugce', 'Saydam, Guray', 'Biray Avci, Cigir', 'Gunduz, Cumhur']","['Asik A', 'Kayabasi C', 'Ozmen Yelken B', 'Yilmaz Susluer S', 'Dogan Sigva ZO', 'Balci Okcanoglu T', 'Saydam G', 'Biray Avci C', 'Gunduz C']","['Ege University, Faculty of Medicine, Department of Medical Biology, Izmir, Turkey.

The medicinal plants in the present study are traditionally used to treat cancer in Kakamega County as recorded in published literature. AIM OF THE STUDY: Due to multidrug resistance (MDR) and severe side effects of currently used drugs in clinical oncology, new candidate compounds are urgently required to improve treatment outcome. The present study explored the in vitro cytotoxic potential of 34 organic and 19 aqueous extracts of Kakamega medicinal plants towards sensitive and multidrug-resistant cancer cell lines. METHODS AND RESULTS: The cytotoxicity was determined using the resazurin assay. Eight organic and two aqueous plant extracts inhibited the growth of CCRF-CEM leukemia cells by more than 50%. The organic extracts were Harungana madagascariensis Lam. ex poir (6.6% of untreated control), Prunus africana (Hook.f.) Kalkman (19.4%), Entada abyssinica Steud. ex A. Rich (38.6%), Phyllanthus fischeri Pax (40.7%), Shirakiopsis elliptica (Hochst.) Esser Synonym: Sapium ellipticum (Hochst. kraus) Pax (41.8%), Bridelia micrantha (Hochst.) Baill (45.4%) and Futumia africana Benth. (45.8%) and Microglossa pyrifolia (Lam.) Kuntze (48%). The aqueous extracts were Bridelia micrantha (Hochst.) Baill (31.3%) and Shirakiopsis elliptica (Hochst.) Esser Synonym: Sapium ellipticum (Hochst. Kraus) Pax (48.2%). In addition to P-glycoprotein-expressing tumor cells, we also investigated other mechanisms of drug resistance, i.e. BCRP- or EGFR-transfected and TP53-knockout tumor cells. Some extracts also showed considerable cytotoxic activity against these drug-resistant cell lines. As demonstrated for selected examples, some extracts exhibited enhanced cytotoxicity towards cancer cells, if applied in combination with other extracts. DISCUSSION: The panel of medicinal plants used in the Kakamega County for cancer treatment revealed indeed cytotoxicity to various extent towards cancer cells in vitro. Hence, our results may at least in part substantiate the traditional use of these compounds to treat cancer. Even more interesting, several extracts inhibited otherwise drug-resistant tumor cell lines with similar or even better efficacy than their drug-sensitive counterparts. This provides an attractive perspective for further exploration of their anticancer potential to combat drug resistance of refractory tumors.","[""Ochwang'i, Dominic O"", 'Kimwele, Charles N', 'Oduma, Jemimah A', 'Gathumbi, Peter K', 'Kiama, Stephen G', 'Efferth, Thomas']","[""Ochwang'i DO"", 'Kimwele CN', 'Oduma JA', 'Gathumbi PK', 'Kiama SG', 'Efferth T']","['Department of Veterinary Anatomy and Physiology, University of Nairobi, P.O.

In recent years, gene mutations are found to be potential markers for more accurate risk stratification, but reports on mutation screening of Chinese AML are limited. We aim to display the mutation patterns of Chinese AML patients, reveal the genotype-phenotype correlations and make a comparison with Caucasians patients. METHODS: Genome DNA from 78 patients' bone marrow were extracted for targeted gene mutation panel by next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology. Statistics and bioinformatics were used to analyze the correlations between gene mutations and clinical features, as well as the comparison of our results with the Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network (TCGA) public AML dataset. RESULTS: We found patients with mutations of FLT3 and TET2 had higher bone marrow blasts, peripheral blasts and white blood cell (WBC) count, mutations of SRSF2 were related with age, and mutations of FLT3-ITD, DNMT3A, IDH1, TET2 and SRSF2 were risk factors for overall survival. What's more, we discovered 15 novel mutations and difference of mutational incidence in 6 genes between Chinese and Caucasians AML. Bioinformatic analysis revealed some relationship between gene mutations and expressions as well as drug sensitivities. CONCLUSIONS: We made an investigation on the mutation patterns of Chinese AML patients by NGS technique and revealed correlations between gene mutations and clinical features. Thus we recommend routine testing of suspected genes for better prognostic prediction and individualized treatment.","['Han, Xiaoyu', 'Li, Wei', 'He, Na', 'Feng, Panpan', 'Pang, Yihua', 'Ji, Chunyan', 'Ma, Daoxin']","['Han X', 'Li W', 'He N', 'Feng P', 'Pang Y', 'Ji C', 'Ma D']","['Department of Hematology, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong 250012, PR China.', 'Department of Hematology, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong 250012, PR China.', 'Department of Hematology, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong 250012, PR China.', 'Department of Hematology, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong 250012, PR China.', 'Department of Hematology, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong 250012, PR China.', 'Department of Hematology, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong 250012, PR China.

However, the temporal recruitment of immune regulators to infecting viral genomes remains poorly defined due to the technical difficulties associated with low genome copy-number detection. Here we utilize 5-Ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) labelling of herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) DNA in combination with click chemistry to examine the sequential recruitment of host immune regulators to infecting viral genomes under low multiplicity of infection conditions. Following viral genome entry into the nucleus, PML-nuclear bodies (PML-NBs) rapidly entrapped viral DNA (vDNA) leading to a block in viral replication in the absence of the viral PML-NB antagonist ICP0. This pre-existing intrinsic host defence to infection occurred independently of the vDNA pathogen sensor IFI16 (Interferon Gamma Inducible Protein 16) and the induction of interferon stimulated gene (ISG) expression, demonstrating that vDNA entry into the nucleus alone is not sufficient to induce a robust innate immune response. Saturation of this pre-existing intrinsic host defence during HSV-1 ICP0-null mutant infection led to the stable recruitment of PML and IFI16 into vDNA complexes associated with ICP4, and led to the induction of ISG expression. This induced innate immune response occurred in a PML-, IFI16-, and Janus-Associated Kinase (JAK)-dependent manner and was restricted by phosphonoacetic acid, demonstrating that vDNA polymerase activity is required for the robust induction of ISG expression during HSV-1 infection. Our data identifies dual roles for PML in the sequential regulation of intrinsic and innate immunity to HSV-1 infection that are dependent on viral genome delivery to the nucleus and the onset of vDNA replication, respectively. These intracellular host defences are counteracted by ICP0, which targets PML for degradation from the outset of nuclear infection to promote vDNA release from PML-NBs and the onset of HSV-1 lytic replication.","['Alandijany, Thamir', 'Roberts, Ashley P E', 'Conn, Kristen L', 'Loney, Colin', 'McFarlane, Steven', 'Orr, Anne', 'Boutell, Chris']","['Alandijany T', 'Roberts APE', 'Conn KL', 'Loney C', 'McFarlane S', 'Orr A', 'Boutell C']","['MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research (CVR), Garscube Campus, Glasgow, Scotland, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Medical Laboratory Technology, Faculty of Applied Medical Sciences, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.', 'MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research (CVR), Garscube Campus, Glasgow, Scotland, United Kingdom.', 'MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research (CVR), Garscube Campus, Glasgow, Scotland, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Biochemistry, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada.', 'MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research (CVR), Garscube Campus, Glasgow, Scotland, United Kingdom.', 'MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research (CVR), Garscube Campus, Glasgow, Scotland, United Kingdom.', 'MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research (CVR), Garscube Campus, Glasgow, Scotland, United Kingdom.', 'MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research (CVR), Garscube Campus, Glasgow, Scotland, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['MC_UP_A550_1030/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'MC_UU_12012/5/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'MC_UU_12014/5/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180108,United States,PLoS Pathog,PLoS pathogens,101238921,PMC5757968,,,2018/01/09 06:00,2018/06/26 06:00,['2018/01/09 06:00'],"['2017/08/31 00:00 [received]', '2017/11/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/01/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/06/26 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.ppat.1006769 [doi]', 'PPATHOGENS-D-17-01911 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS Pathog. 2018 Jan 8;14(1):e1006769. doi: 10.1371/journal.ppat.1006769. eCollection 2018 Jan.,20180625,1,"['0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', '148998-64-5 (IFI16 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Click Chemistry', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral/*drug effects', 'Herpes Simplex/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology/virology', 'Herpesvirus 1, Human/growth & development/*physiology', '*Host-Pathogen Interactions/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Innate/drug effects', 'Inclusion Bodies, Viral/drug effects/*metabolism/pathology/virology', 'Kinetics', 'Lysogeny/drug effects', 'Mutation', 'Nuclear Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Phosphoproteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Viral Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Virus Internalization/drug effects', 'Virus Replication/drug effects']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-3639-7209', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0508-1781', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2970-7785']",,,,,,['PLoS Pathog. 2018 Feb 22;14 (2):e1006927.

Antibody levels against hepatitis B virus was assessed both at the time of diagnosis and within 6 months after completion of chemotherapy. However, measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) antibodies levels were measured just within 6 months after completion of chemotherapy. RESULTS: Anti-HBs antibody titers had decreased below the protective level after treatment in 25 of 96 patients having protective antibody levels for hepatitis B virus before therapy. In 66 patients without pretreatment protective levels of antibody, in spite of the immunization during chemotherapy, only 6 of them were found to be anti-HBS positive after treatment. In 153 patients previously vaccinated with MMR, 19 had protective antibody titers after treatment. MMR seropositivities were negatively correlated to age as expected. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that a significant number of children lose preexisting humoral immunity against MMR and hepatitis B after completion of chemotherapy.","['Keskin Yildirim, Zuhal', 'Buyukavci, Mustafa']","['Keskin Yildirim Z', 'Buyukavci M']","['Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Faculty of Medicine, Ataturk University, Erzurum.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Faculty of Medicine, Sakarya University, Sakarya, Turkey.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,,,,2018/01/09 06:00,2019/03/22 06:00,['2018/01/09 06:00'],"['2018/01/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/22 06:00 [medline]', '2018/01/09 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/MPH.0000000000001072 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2018 Mar;40(2):e99-e102. doi: 10.1097/MPH.0000000000001072.,20190321,2,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antibodies, Viral/*blood/immunology', '*Cancer Survivors', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Hepatitis B/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Humoral/*immunology', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Measles/immunology', 'Mumps/immunology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Rubella/immunology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Limited data exists concerning its expression in B-cell lymphomas, and comparison with other GC-associated antigens is lacking. Its role in the differential diagnosis of B-cell lymphomas, particularly in the distinction of follicular lymphoma (FL) versus marginal zone lymphoma (MZL), remains to be determined. We evaluated MEF2B expression, in comparison with additional GC markers, LIM domain-only transcription factor 2 (LMO2), and human GC-associated lymphoma (HGAL), in a variety of B-cell lymphomas, with particular emphasis on their utility in differentiating FL from MZL. MEF2B was positive in all FL and Burkitt lymphomas, 8/9 mantle cell lymphomas, 2/24 splenic MZL, 1/10 chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphomas, and 38/44 diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), but was negative in all extranodal MZL of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue, nodal MZL, and B-lymphoblastic lymphomas. Focusing on low-grade FL versus MZL, MEF2B was 100% sensitive and 95% specific for FL, which was similar to BCL6, but superior to LMO2 (sensitivity 87%, specificity 86%) and HGAL (sensitivity 97%, specificity 86%). Importantly, MEF2B was positive in 4/4 FL with plasmacytoid differentiation, which were CD10, only weakly BCL6, and included 1 case that lacked both LMO2 and HGAL expression. MEF2B was positive in 22/25 (88%) GC-type DLBCL, but was also positive in 16/19 (61%) non-GC-type DLBCL. MEF2B shows superior sensitivity and specificity than LMO2 and HGAL in the differential diagnosis of FL versus MZL and is particularly useful in FL with plasmacytoid differentiation, which may have morphologic and immunophenotypic overlap with MZL. MEF2B, however, is not specific for GC-derived B-cell lymphomas as it is also apparently positive in most mantle cell lymphoma and many non-GC-type DLBCL.","['Moore, Erika M', 'Swerdlow, Steven H', 'Gibson, Sarah E']","['Moore EM', 'Swerdlow SH', 'Gibson SE']","['University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Am J Surg Pathol,The American journal of surgical pathology,7707904,,,,2018/01/09 06:00,2019/03/12 06:00,['2018/01/09 06:00'],"['2018/01/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/12 06:00 [medline]', '2018/01/09 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/PAS.0000000000001015 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Surg Pathol. 2018 Mar;42(3):342-350. doi: 10.1097/PAS.0000000000001015.,20190311,3,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (GCSAM protein, human)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (LIM Domain Proteins)', '0 (LMO2 protein, human)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (MEF2 Transcription Factors)', '0 (MEF2B protein, human)', '0 (Microfilament Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 3.4.24.11 (Neprilysin)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/*analysis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Germinal Center/*immunology/pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'LIM Domain Proteins/*analysis', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/classification/*immunology/pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell, Marginal Zone/immunology/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/immunology/pathology', 'MEF2 Transcription Factors/analysis', 'Microfilament Proteins', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*analysis', 'Neprilysin/analysis', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*analysis', 'Tissue Array Analysis']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We observed a striking quantitative and qualitative heterogeneity that was directly dependent on the specific genetic events in the tumor and ranged from 'cold', noninflamed tumors to massively infiltrated landscapes-results with important therapeutic implications. Further, we showed these qualitative differences in transcriptomic analysis of human prostate cancer samples.

Induction of apoptosis has been proposed as a mechanism of Plt effects on tumor cells. The purpose of this study was to clarify the role of Plts and Plt-derived components in the induction of apoptosis in the blood mononuclear cells of patients with leukemia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this experimental study, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from whole blood of five patients with childhood B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (pre-B ALL) and encountered with Plts, Plt-derived microparticles (Plt-MPs) as well as purified soluble CD40L (sCD40L). After 48 hours of co-culture, the anti-cancer activity of the aforementioned factors was surveyed using examination of apoptosis markers of the cells including active caspase-3 and CD95 using ELISA and flow cytometer techniques, respectively. Additionally, staining of the cells with 7-Aminoactinomycin D (7-AAD) was evaluated by flow cytometer technique. Trypan blue exclusion test and WST-1 method were also used to compare the death/survival status of the cells. RESULTS: Levels of CD95 and caspase-3 were significantly increased in the all treated groups (P<0.05). On the other hand, trypan blue, 7-AAD and WST-1 methods showed significantly lower number of the live cells in the treated groups (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This study can show the ability of Plts, Plt-MPs and sCD40L for the induction of apoptosis in PBMCs of pre-B-ALL patients. Further studies are necessary to elucidate the different effects of platelets on cancer cells in vitro and in vivo.","['Yaftian, Morteza', 'Yari, Fatemeh', 'Ghasemzadeh, Mehran', 'Fallah Azad, Vahid', 'Haghighi, Mansoureh']","['Yaftian M', 'Yari F', 'Ghasemzadeh M', 'Fallah Azad V', 'Haghighi M']","['Blood Transfusion Research Center, High Institute for Research and Education in Transfusion Medicine, Tehran, Iran.', 'Blood Transfusion Research Center, High Institute for Research and Education in Transfusion Medicine, Tehran, Iran.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short ncRNAs which play crucial roles in ESCs. Here, we explored the impact of miR-302b-3p on ESC self-renewal in the absence of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this experimental study, ESCs were cultured in the presence of 15% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and induced to differentiate by LIF removal. miR-302b-3p overexpression was performed by transient transfection of mature miRNA mimics. Cell cycle profiling was done using propidium iodide (PI) staining followed by flow cytometry. miRNA expression was quantified using a miR-302b-3p-specific TaqMan assay. Data were analyzed using t test, and a P<0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: We observed that miR-302b-3p promoted the viability of both wild-type and LIF-withdrawn ESCs. It also increased ESC clonogenicity and alkaline phosphatase (AP) activity. The defective cell cycling of LIF-deprived ESCs was completely rescued by miR-302b-3p delivery. Moreover, miR-302b-3p inhibited the increased cell death rate induced by LIF removal.

At first, it was first assumed that angiogenesis is not implicated in the development of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) as a liquid tumor. One of the most important elements in bone marrow microenvironment is mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). These cells possess an intrinsic tropism for sites of tumor in various types of cancers and have an impact on solid tumors growth by affecting the angiogenic process. But so far, our knowledge is limited about MSCs' role in liquid tumors angiogenesis. By increasing our knowledge about the role of MSCs on angiogenesis, new therapeutic strategies can be used to improve the status of patients with leukemia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this experimental study, HL-60, K562 and U937 cells were separately co-cultured with bone marrow derived-MSCs and after 8, 16 and 24 hours, alterations in the expression of 10 chemokine genes involved in angiogenesis, were evaluated by quantitative real time-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Mono-cultures of leukemia cell lines were used as controls. RESULTS: We observed that in HL-60 and K562 cells co-cultured with MSCs, the expression of CXCL10 and CXCL3 genes are increased, respectively as compared to the control cells. Also, in U937 cells co-cultured with MSCs, the expression of CXCL6 gene was upgraded. Moreover in U937 cells, CCL2 gene expression in the first 16 hours was lower than the control cells, while within 24 hours its expression augmented. CONCLUSIONS: Our observations, for the first time, demonstrated that bone marrow (BM)-MSCs are able to alter the expression profile of chemokine genes involved in angiogenesis, in acute myeloid leukemia cell lines. MSCs cause different effects on angiogenesis in different leukemia cell lines; in some cases, MSCs promote angiogenesis, and in others, inhibit it.","['Mohammadi Najafabadi, Maryam', 'Shamsasenjan, Karim', 'Akbarzadehlaleh, Parvin']","['Mohammadi Najafabadi M', 'Shamsasenjan K', 'Akbarzadehlaleh P']","['Immunology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Immunology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.

It uses a dielectrophoresis (DEP)-induced vertical translation of live cells in conjunction with particle image velocimetry (PIV) in order to measure probabilistic distribution of DEP forces acting on an entire cell population. The method is integrated in a microfluidic device. The bottom of the microfluidic channel is lined with an interdigitated electrode array. Cells passing through the micro-channel are acted on by sedimentation forces, while DEP forces either oppose sedimentation, support sedimentation, or neither, depending on the dielectric (DE) signatures of the cells. The heights at which cells stabilize correspond to their DE signature and are measured indirectly using PIV, which enables simultaneous and high-throughput collection of hundreds of single-cell responses in a single PIV frame. The system was validated using polystyrene micro-particles. Preliminary experimental data quantify the DE signatures of immortalized myelogenous leukemia cell lines K562 and KG1.

This review summarizes recent advances in the biology of SALL4 with a focus on its regulatory functions in normal and leukemic hematopoiesis. In the normal hematopoietic system, expression of SALL4 is mainly enriched in the bone marrow hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSCs/HPCs), but is rapidly silenced following lineage differentiation. In hematopoietic malignancies, however, SALL4 expression is abnormally re-activated and linked with deteriorated disease status in patients. Further, SALL4 activation participates in the pathogenesis of tumor initiation and disease progression. Thus, a better understanding of SALL4's biologic functions and mechanisms will facilitate development of advanced targeted anti-leukemia approaches in future.","['Yang, Jianchang']",['Yang J'],"['Department of Surgery and Medicine, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030 USA.0000 0001 2160 926Xgrid.39382.33']",['eng'],['R01 HL121294/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20180103,England,Biomark Res,Biomarker research,101607860,PMC5751604,['NOTNLM'],"['Apoptosis', 'Chromatin modification', 'Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells', 'Mixed-lineage leukemia', 'Pluripotency', 'Transgenic', 'Wnt/beta-catenin signaling']",2018/01/09 06:00,2018/01/09 06:01,['2018/01/09 06:00'],"['2017/11/16 00:00 [received]', '2017/12/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/01/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/09 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s40364-017-0115-6 [doi]', '115 [pii]']",epublish,Biomark Res. 2018 Jan 3;6:1. doi: 10.1186/s40364-017-0115-6. eCollection 2018.,,,,,,,,"['Not applicable.Not applicable.The author declares that he has no competing', 'interests.Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in', 'published maps and institutional affiliations.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although broadly used, glomerularfiltration rate (GFR) estimation equations were not fully validatedin this special population. Thus, this study was designed to furtherassess the accuracy of various GFR equations, including the newly2012 CKD-EPI equations. Referring to (99m)Tc-DTPA clearance method, three Scr-based (MDRD, Peking, and CKD-EPIScr), three Scys C-based (Steven 1, Steven 2, and CKD-EPIScys C), and three Scr-Scys C combination based (Ma,Steven 3, and CKD-EPIScr-Scys C) equationswere included. Bias, P30, and misclassificationrate were applied to compare the applicability of the selected equations.A total of 180 Chinese hematological patients were enrolled. Meanbias, absolute mean bias, P30, misclassificationrate and Bland-Altman plots of the CKD-EPIScr-Scys C equation were 7.90 mL/minute/1.73 m(2),17.77 mL/minute/1.73 m(2), 73.3%, 38% and79.7 mL/minute/1.73 m(2), respectively. CKD-EPIScr-Scys C predicted the most precise eGFR both in lymphomaand leukemia subgroups. Additionally, CKD-EPIScys C equation in rGFR >== 90 mL/minute/1.73 m(2) subgroup and Steven 2 equation in rGFR<90 mL/minute/1.73 m(2) subgroup provided relatively more accurate estimatesin each subgroup.The CKD-EPIScr-Scys C equationcould be recommended to monitor kidney function in blood patients.The accuracy of GFR equations might be closely related with GFR leveland kidney function markers, but not the primary cause of hematopathy.","['Sun, Han', 'Pei, Xiaohua', 'Wu, Jianqing', 'Zhao, Weihong']","['Sun H', 'Pei X', 'Wu J', 'Zhao W']","['Division of Nephrology,Departmentof Geriatrics, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University,300 Guangzhou Road, Nanjing, Jiangsu 210029, China.', 'Division of Nephrology,Departmentof Geriatrics, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University,300 Guangzhou Road, Nanjing, Jiangsu 210029, China.', 'Division of Respiratory, Departmentof Geriatrics, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University,300 Guangzhou Road, Nanjing, Jiangsu 210029, China.', 'Division of Nephrology,Departmentof Geriatrics, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University,300 Guangzhou Road, Nanjing, Jiangsu 210029, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20171101,China,J Biomed Res,Journal of biomedical research,101551157,PMC6352883,,,2018/01/09 06:00,2018/01/09 06:00,['2018/01/09 06:00'],"['2018/01/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/01/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.7555/JBR.32.20160172 [doi]'],aheadofprint,J Biomed Res. 2017 Nov 1. doi: 10.7555/JBR.32.20160172.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mutations in these components of the spliceosome machinery have been recently implicated in leukemogenesis. The fact that UHMK1 regulates these factors suggests that UHMK1 might be involved in RNA processing and perhaps leukemogenesis. Here we analyzed UHMK1 expression in normal hematopoietic and leukemic cells as well as its function in leukemia cell line. In the normal hematopoietic compartment, markedly higher levels of transcripts were observed in differentiated lymphocytes (CD4(+), CD8(+) and CD19(+)) compared to the progenitor enriched subpopulation (CD34(+)) or leukemia cell lines. UHMK1 expression was upregulated in megakaryocytic-, monocytic- and granulocytic-induced differentiation of established leukemia cell lines and in erythrocytic-induced differentiation of CD34(+) cells. No aberrant expression was observed in patient samples of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), acute myeloid (AML) or lymphoblastic (ALL) leukemia. Nonetheless, in MDS patients, increased levels of UHMK1 expression positively impacted event free and overall survival. Lentivirus mediated UHMK1 knockdown did not affect proliferation, cell cycle progression, apoptosis or migration of U937 leukemia cells, although UHMK1 silencing strikingly increased clonogenicity of these cells. Thus, our results suggest that UHMK1 plays a role in hematopoietic cell differentiation and suppression of autonomous clonal growth of leukemia cells.","['Barbutti, Isabella', 'Machado-Neto, Joao Agostinho', 'Arfelli, Vanessa Cristina', 'de Melo Campos, Paula', 'Traina, Fabiola', 'Saad, Sara Teresinha Olalla', 'Archangelo, Leticia Frohlich']","['Barbutti I', 'Machado-Neto JA', 'Arfelli VC', 'de Melo Campos P', 'Traina F', 'Saad STO', 'Archangelo LF']","['Hematology and Transfusion Medicine Center, State University of Campinas (UNICAMP), Carlos Chagas 480, 13083-878 Campinas, SP, Brazil.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Ribeirao Preto Medical School, University of Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Department of Cellular and Molecular Biology and Pathogenic Bioagents, Ribeirao Preto Medical School, University of Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Hematology and Transfusion Medicine Center, State University of Campinas (UNICAMP), Carlos Chagas 480, 13083-878 Campinas, SP, Brazil.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Ribeirao Preto Medical School, University of Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Hematology and Transfusion Medicine Center, State University of Campinas (UNICAMP), Carlos Chagas 480, 13083-878 Campinas, SP, Brazil.', 'Hematology and Transfusion Medicine Center, State University of Campinas (UNICAMP), Carlos Chagas 480, 13083-878 Campinas, SP, Brazil; Department of Cellular and Molecular Biology and Pathogenic Bioagents, Ribeirao Preto Medical School, University of Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, Sao Paulo, Brazil.

Allogeneic SCT from a haploidentical donor has a remarkable alloreactive effect in patients with leukemia; thus, we evaluated this approach in children with very high-risk NBL. We analyzed data from 2 prospective phase I/II trials. A total of 26 patients with refractory (n = 5), metastatic relapsed (n = 20), or locally relapsed MYCN-positive (n = 1) NBL received a median of 17 x 10(6)/kg T/B cell-depleted CD34(+) stem cells with 68 x 10(3)/kg residual T cells and 107 x 10(6)/kg natural killer cells. The conditioning regimen comprised melphalan, fludarabine, thiotepa, OKT3, and a short course of mycophenolate mofetil post-transplantation. Engraftment occurred in 96% of the patients. Event-free survival and overall survival at 5 years were 19% and 23%, respectively. No transplantation-related mortality was observed, and the single death was due to progression/subsequent relapse. The median duration of follow-up was 8.1 years. Patients in complete remission before SCT had a significantly better prognosis than those with residual tumor load (P < .01). All patients with progressive disease before SCT relapsed within 1 year. Grade II and grade III acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) occurred in 31% and 12% of the patients, respectively. Chronic limited and extensive GVHD occurred in 28% and 10%, respectively. Our data indicate that haploidentical SCT is a feasible treatment option that can induce long-term remission in some patients with NBL with tolerable side effects, and may enable the development of further post-transplantation therapeutic strategies based on the donor-derived immune system.","['Illhardt, Toni', 'Toporski, Jacek', 'Feuchtinger, Tobias', 'Turkiewicz, Dominik', 'Teltschik, Heiko-Manuel', 'Ebinger, Martin', 'Schwarze, Carl-Philipp', 'Holzer, Ursula', 'Lode, Holger N', 'Albert, Michael H', 'Gruhn, Bernd', 'Urban, Christian', 'Dykes, Josefina H', 'Teuffel, Oliver', 'Schumm, Michael', 'Handgretinger, Rupert', 'Lang, Peter']","['Illhardt T', 'Toporski J', 'Feuchtinger T', 'Turkiewicz D', 'Teltschik HM', 'Ebinger M', 'Schwarze CP', 'Holzer U', 'Lode HN', 'Albert MH', 'Gruhn B', 'Urban C', 'Dykes JH', 'Teuffel O', 'Schumm M', 'Handgretinger R', 'Lang P']","[""Department of Pediatrics, Children's University Hospital, University of Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Skane University Hospital, Lund, Sweden.', ""Department of Pediatrics, Children's University Hospital, University of Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany; Department of Pediatrics, Dr. von Hauner Children's Hospital, University Children's Hospital, Munich, Germany."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Skane University Hospital, Lund, Sweden.', ""Department of Pediatrics, Children's University Hospital, University of Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Children's University Hospital, University of Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Children's University Hospital, University of Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Children's University Hospital, University of Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Children's University Hospital, University of Greifswald, Greifswald, Germany."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Dr. von Hauner Children's Hospital, University Children's Hospital, Munich, Germany."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Jena University Hospital, Jena, Germany.', ""Department of Pediatrics, Children's University Hospital, Medical University of Graz, Graz, Austria."", 'Department of Clinical Immunology and Transfusion Medicine, Office for Medical Services, Region Skane, Lund, Sweden; Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', ""Department of Pediatrics, Children's University Hospital, University of Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany; Medical Service of the Statutory Health Fund, Baden-Wuerttemberg, Germany."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Children's University Hospital, University of Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Children's University Hospital, University of Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Children's University Hospital, University of Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.

In this study, we found that transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta) signaling was upregulated in HSCs from bone marrow of mice with MLL-AF9-induced acute myeloid leukemia (AML) because of excessive production of TGFbeta1, especially from megakaryocytes, and overactivation of latent TGFbeta1 protein.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Single-center retrospective study of acute leukemia patients (2006-2015) to investigate three aspects of CDC: its impact on the time interval between diagnosis and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, when required (non-parametric Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test); its impact on overall survival (Cox proportional hazard regression model); antifungal therapeutic strategies implemented. RESULTS: A total of 639 patients presenting with acute leukemia were included; 144 were transplanted and 29 developed CDC. CDC did not significantly increase the time interval between diagnosis and transplantation, nor did it impact the overall survival of recipients. An improved overall survival was observed in non-transplanted acute leukemia patients presenting with CDC. CONCLUSION: CDC should not postpone transplantation if antifungal treatment is optimized.","['Grateau, A', 'Le Marechal, M', 'Labussiere-Wallet, H', 'Ducastelle-Lepretre, S', 'Nicolini, F-E', 'Thomas, X', 'Morisset, S', 'Michallet, M', 'Ader, F']","['Grateau A', 'Le Marechal M', 'Labussiere-Wallet H', 'Ducastelle-Lepretre S', 'Nicolini FE', 'Thomas X', 'Morisset S', 'Michallet M', 'Ader F']","[""Departement d'hematologie, centre hospitalier Lyon-Sud, hospices civils de Lyon, 69495 Pierre-Benite, France."", 'Universite de Lorraine, EA 4360 APEMAC, Nancy, France; Departement de sante publique, CHU de Nice, Nice, France.', ""Departement d'hematologie, centre hospitalier Lyon-Sud, hospices civils de Lyon, 69495 Pierre-Benite, France."", ""Departement d'hematologie, centre hospitalier Lyon-Sud, hospices civils de Lyon, 69495 Pierre-Benite, France."", ""Departement d'hematologie, centre hospitalier Lyon-Sud, hospices civils de Lyon, 69495 Pierre-Benite, France."", ""Departement d'hematologie, centre hospitalier Lyon-Sud, hospices civils de Lyon, 69495 Pierre-Benite, France."", ""Departement d'hematologie, centre hospitalier Lyon-Sud, hospices civils de Lyon, 69495 Pierre-Benite, France."", ""Departement d'hematologie, centre hospitalier Lyon-Sud, hospices civils de Lyon, 69495 Pierre-Benite, France; Departement de maladies infectieuses et tropicales, hospices civils de Lyon, 69004 Lyon, France."", 'Departement de maladies infectieuses et tropicales, hospices civils de Lyon, 69004 Lyon, France; Inserm U1111 CIRI, universite Claude-Bernard-Lyon 1, Lyon, France.

This review discusses the presentation, diagnostic evaluation, and treatment options for metastatic lesions to these components of the peripheral nervous system and is organized based on the anatomic distribution. As skull base metastases (also discussed in Chapter 14) result in cranial neuropathies, these will be covered in detail, as well as cancers that directly infiltrate the cranial nerves. Particular emphasis is placed on the clinical, imaging, and electrodiagnostic features that differentiate neoplastic plexopathies from radiation-induced plexopathies. Neurolymphomatosis, in which malignant lymphocytes invade the cranial nerves, nerve roots, brachial and lumbosacral plexuses, and peripheral nerves, is a rare manifestation of lymphoma and leukemia. Diagnoses of neurolymphomatosis are often missed or delayed given its varied presentations, resulting in poorer outcomes.

FA patients have a higher risk of cancer, including acute myeloid leukaemia and squamous cell carcinoma. Maximum, but not all, affected individuals have one or more somatic abnormalities, including skin, skeletal, genitourinary, gastrointestinal, cardiac and neurological anomalies, etc. Positive stress cytogenetics has immense implications for the treatment and management of FA. The aim of our study was to find out the incidence of FA in the population of phenotypically normal aplastic anaemia (AA) patients in West Bengal. METHODS: Ethical clearances were obtained from the corresponding institutional committees. A total of 117 AA cases was selected. Stress cytogenetics was performed from peripheral venous blood (PVB) samples of 63 AA patients (age </= 50 years) and 63 age- and sex-matched healthy individual (control) using Mitomycin C (MMC). RESULTS: Out of 63 AA patients, 6 (9.25%) cases showed positive stress cytogenetics suggestive of FA, which is statistically significant (p-value - 0.000532), analysed by chi-square test. DISCUSSION: A considerable percentage of patients showing sensitivity towards MMC, even if they are phenotypically normal and did not have any distinguishable features which are generally found in FA. CONCLUSION: This observation may indicate that stress cytogenetics analysis of phenotypically normal AA patients (</=50 years) is essential for the improvement of the treatment procedure.","['Dutta, Atreyee', 'De, Rajib', 'Dolai, Tuphan Kanti', 'Pal, Pritha', 'Ghosh, Shanoli', 'Mitra, Pradip Kumar', 'Halder, Ajanta']","['Dutta A', 'De R', 'Dolai TK', 'Pal P', 'Ghosh S', 'Mitra PK', 'Halder A']","['a Vivekananda Institute of Medical Sciences , Kolkata , India.', 'b Nil Ratan Sircar Medical College & Hospital , Kolkata , India.', 'b Nil Ratan Sircar Medical College & Hospital , Kolkata , India.', 'a Vivekananda Institute of Medical Sciences , Kolkata , India.', 'a Vivekananda Institute of Medical Sciences , Kolkata , India.', 'c Department Of Health , Swasthya Bhawan , Kolkata , India.', 'a Vivekananda Institute of Medical Sciences , Kolkata , India.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20180107,England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,,['NOTNLM'],"['Fanconi anaemia', 'aplastic anaemia', 'mitomycin C', 'phenotypically normal aplastic anaemia patients', 'radial structure', 'stress cytogenetics']",2018/01/09 06:00,2018/10/20 06:00,['2018/01/09 06:00'],"['2018/01/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/20 06:00 [medline]', '2018/01/09 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10245332.2017.1422322 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematology. 2018 Aug;23(7):405-412. doi: 10.1080/10245332.2017.1422322.

Genetic variation in solute carrier organic anion transporter family member 1A2 (SLCO1A2, the coding gene of OATP1A2) has important implications for the elimination of MTX. We investigated the association between a microRNA (miRNA) binding site polymorphism (rs4149009 G > A) in the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of SLCO1A2 with the serum MTX concentrations in Chinese children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Genotyping for SLCO1A2 rs4149009 G > A in 141 children with ALL was performed using the Sequenom MassARRAY system. Serum MTX concentrations were determined by fluorescence polarization immunoassay. The percentages of MTX level >/=1mumol/L at 42h were compared among the AA, GA, and GG genotypes. The minor allele frequency observed in this study (33.0%) was significantly lower than that in the African samples reported in the 1000 Genomes Project (57.4%, P=0.00). The incidence rate of delayed MTX elimination was significantly higher in patients with the GG genotype (23.1%) compared with the AA genotype (0.0%, P=0.03). Bioinformatics tools predicted that the rs4149009 A allele would disrupt the putative binding sites of hsa-miR-324-3p and hsa-miR-1913. These results indicate that the rs4149009 G > A polymorphism might affect MTX pharmacokinetics by interfering with the function of miRNAs.","['Wang, Shu-Mei', 'Zeng, Wei-Xin', 'Wu, Wan-Shui', 'Sun, Lu-Lu', 'Yan, Dan']","['Wang SM', 'Zeng WX', 'Wu WS', 'Sun LL', 'Yan D']","['Beijing Key Laboratory of Bio-characteristic Profiling for Evaluation of Rational Drug Use, Beijing Shijitan Hospital, Capital Medical University, No 10 Tieyi Road, Yangfangdian, Haidian District, Beijing, 100038, China; Department of Pharmacy, Beijing Shijitan Hospital, Capital Medical University, No 10 Tieyi Road, Yangfangdian, Haidian District, Beijing, 100038, China.

The aim of this study was to apply sLORETA in the evaluation of possible effects of Ara-C on brain connectivity in patients with AML without CNS involvement. We studied eight patients with AML; four were administered standard doses of Ara-C while the other four received high doses. sLORETA was computed from computerized EEG data before treatment and after six months of treatment. Three regions of interest, corresponding to specific combinations of Brodmann areas, were defined. In the patients receiving high-dose Ara-C, a statistically significant reduction in functional connectivity was observed in the fronto-parietal network, which literature data suggest is involved in attentional processes.

However, hematopoiesis in leukemic milieus is largely unknown. In the present study, we utilized one of the most frequent leukemogenic translocations MLL-AF9 to induce leukemia and investigated the hematopoiesis and the activity of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) in a leukemic milieu. We found that the phenotypes of the non-leukemic population in leukemic BM were drastically different than normal BM, including blockage of differentiation and a drastically reduced Lin-/Sca+/c-kit+ (LSK) population that contains all HSPCs in leukemic BM. Further, transplantation assays demonstrated that stem cell function of HSPCs from leukemic BM was significantly compromised. Intriguingly, BM from a patient-derived xenograft leukemia model and from immunocompromised mice transplanted with murine MLL-AF9 cells, showed comparable percentage of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) to normal controls, indicating that an immunocompetent microenvironment is critical for leukemia-induced loss of HSPCs. Mechanistically, we found that the non-leukemic cells from leukemic BM possessed a more inflammatory profile than either leukemic cells or normal BM counterparts. Co-culturing or co-transplantation with non-leukemic cells from leukemic BM impaired the stem cell function of normal HSPCs in vitro and in vivo respectively, suggesting that the highly inflammatory non-leukemic population in leukemic BM not only is functionally abnormal but displayed a 'leukemia-like' characteristic. Finally, we tested the effect of the anti-inflammation drug diclofenac on leukemia mice. However, no phenotypic changes of HSPCs were observed upon diclofenac treatment due to only mild repression of inflammatory genes by diclofenac, further indicating that inflammation is a powerful negative regulator of HSPCs. Together, our results suggest that leukemia impairs normal hematopoiesis and inflammation as well as immune cells play a critical role in leukemia-induced BM failure.","['Cui, Ping', 'Zhang, Yuhua', 'Cui, Maoxiang', 'Li, Zhihong', 'Ma, Guang', 'Wang, Rufeng', 'Wang, Ning', 'Huang, Shujuan', 'Gao, Jie']","['Cui P', 'Zhang Y', 'Cui M', 'Li Z', 'Ma G', 'Wang R', 'Wang N', 'Huang S', 'Gao J']","['Department of Pathology, Cangzhou Medical College, China.

Currently, the most common indication for Ommaya reservoir insertion (ORI) in adults is for patients with hematologic or leptomeningeal disorders requiring repeated injection of chemotherapy into the CSF space. Historically, the intraventricular catheter has been inserted blindly based on anatomical landmarks. The purpose of this study was to examine short-term complication rates with ORI with image guidance (IG) and without image guidance (non-IG). METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated all operative cases of ORI from 2000 to 2014 by the senior author. Patient demographic data, surgical outcomes, and peri-operative complications were collected. Accurate placement and early (30-day) morbidity or mortality were considered primary outcomes. RESULTS: Fifty-five consecutive patients underwent ORI by the senior author over the study period (43.5 +/- 16.6 years; 40.0% female). Indications for placement included acute lymphoblastic leukemia, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, and leptomeningeal carcinomatosis. There were seven (12.7%) total complications: three (37.5%) with no-IG versus four (8.5%) with IG. Catheter malpositions were significantly higher in the non-IG group at 37.5% compared to 2.1%. Catheters were also more likely to require multiple passes with non-IG at 25% compare to 0% with IG. There were no early infections in either group. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate improved accuracy and decreased complications using an image-guided approach compared with a traditional approach. Our results support routine use of intra-operative image guidance for proximal catheter insertion in elective ORI for intraventricular chemotherapy.","['Lau, Jonathan C', 'Kosteniuk, Suzanne E', 'Macdonald, David R', 'Megyesi, Joseph F']","['Lau JC', 'Kosteniuk SE', 'Macdonald DR', 'Megyesi JF']","['Department of Clinical Neurological Sciences, Western University, London, Ontario, Canada. jonathan.c.lau@gmail.com.', 'Imaging Research Laboratories, Robarts Research Institute, London, Ontario, Canada. jonathan.c.lau@gmail.com.', 'London Health Sciences Centre, University Hospital, 339 Windermere Road, London, Ontario, N6A 5A5, Canada. jonathan.c.lau@gmail.com.', 'Department of Clinical Neurological Sciences, Western University, London, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Clinical Neurological Sciences, Western University, London, Ontario, Canada.', 'London Regional Cancer Program, London, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Clinical Neurological Sciences, Western University, London, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Pathology, Western University, London, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180105,Austria,Acta Neurochir (Wien),Acta neurochirurgica,0151000,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Imaging', '*Neuro-oncology-surgical', '*Neuronavigation', '*Neurosurgery', '*Ommaya reservoir']",2018/01/07 06:00,2019/05/16 06:00,['2018/01/07 06:00'],"['2017/08/31 00:00 [received]', '2017/12/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/16 06:00 [medline]', '2018/01/07 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00701-017-3454-z [doi]', '10.1007/s00701-017-3454-z [pii]']",ppublish,Acta Neurochir (Wien). 2018 Mar;160(3):539-544. doi: 10.1007/s00701-017-3454-z.

This molecule is involved in crucial biological processes, including cell adhesion, migration, death, differentiation and diapedesis, and it influences processes associated with inflammation, immune responses and cancer. CD99 is frequently overexpressed in many types of tumors, particularly pediatric tumors including Ewing sarcoma and specific subtypes of leukemia. Engagement of CD99 induces the death of malignant cells through non-conventional mechanisms. In Ewing sarcoma, triggering of CD99 by specific monoclonal antibodies activates hyperstimulation of micropinocytosis and leads to cancer cells killing through a caspase-independent, non-apoptotic pathway resembling methuosis. This process is characterized by extreme accumulation of vacuoles in the cytoplasmic space, which compromises cell viability, requires the activation of RAS-Rac1 downstream signaling and appears to be rather specific for tumor cells. In addition, anti-CD99 monoclonal antibodies exhibit antitumor activities in xenografts in the absence of immune effector cells or complement proteins. Overall, these data establish CD99 as a new opportunity to treat patients with high expression of CD99, particularly those that are resistant to canonical apoptosis-inducing agents.","['Pasello, Michela', 'Manara, Maria Cristina', 'Scotlandi, Katia']","['Pasello M', 'Manara MC', 'Scotlandi K']","['Experimental Oncology Lab, CRS Development of Biomolecular Therapies, Orthopaedic Rizzoli Institute, via di Barbiano 1/10, 40136, Bologna, Italy. michela.pasello@ior.it.', 'Experimental Oncology Lab, CRS Development of Biomolecular Therapies, Orthopaedic Rizzoli Institute, via di Barbiano 1/10, 40136, Bologna, Italy.', 'Experimental Oncology Lab, CRS Development of Biomolecular Therapies, Orthopaedic Rizzoli Institute, via di Barbiano 1/10, 40136, Bologna, Italy. katia.scotlandi@ior.it.']",['eng'],['IG2016_18451/Associazione Italiana per la Ricerca sul Cancro'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20180106,Netherlands,J Cell Commun Signal,Journal of cell communication and signaling,101308338,PMC5842202,['NOTNLM'],"['CD99', 'Cell differentiation', 'Cell migration', 'Cellular signaling', 'Metastasis']",2018/01/07 06:00,2018/01/07 06:01,['2018/01/07 06:00'],"['2017/12/11 00:00 [received]', '2017/12/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/07 06:01 [medline]', '2018/01/07 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12079-017-0445-z [doi]', '10.1007/s12079-017-0445-z [pii]']",ppublish,J Cell Commun Signal. 2018 Mar;12(1):55-68. doi: 10.1007/s12079-017-0445-z.

The objective of this study is to report on the clinicoepidemiologic features of CML in Tunisia, to evaluate the long-term outcome of patients in chronic (CP) or accelerated phase (AP) treated with IM 400 mg daily as frontline therapy, and to determine imatinib's efficacy and safety. From October 2002 to December 2014, 410 CML patients were treated with IM in six Tunisian departments of hematology. Response (hematologic, cytogenetic, and molecular responses) and outcome-overall survival (OS), event-free survival (EFS), and progression-free survival (PFS)-were evaluated. The following prognostic factors were analyzed for their impact on the European leukemia net (ELN) response, OS, EFS, and PFS at 5 years: age, sex, leukocyte count, Sokal score, European Treatment and Outcome Study (EUTOS) score, CML phase, time to starting IM, and impact of adverse events. The median age was 45 years (3-85 years). Two hundred ten (51.2%) patients were male. Splenomegaly was present in 322 of the 410 (79%). Additional cytogenetic abnormalities were encountered in 25 (6.3%) patients. At diagnosis, 379 (92.4%) patients were in CP, 31 (7.6%) were in AP. The Sokal risk was low in 87 (22.5%), intermediate in 138 (35.7%), and high in 164 patients (41.9%). The EUTOS risk was low in 217 (74%), and high in 77 (26%) patients. The rates of cumulative complete cytogenetic response (CCyR), major molecular response (MMR), and molecular response 4/5 log (MR4.5) in CP/AP-CML patients were 72, 68.4, and 46.4%, respectively. The median time to reach CCyR, MMR, and MR4.5 was 6 months (3-51), 18 months (3-72), and 24 months (3-100), respectively. According to the ELN criteria, optimal, suboptimal response, and failure were noted in 206 (51.8%), 61 (15.3%), and 125 (31.4%) patients, respectively. Five-year event-free survival (EFS), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) were 81, 90, and 90%, respectively. By multivariate analysis, AP, high EUTOS risk, and baseline WBC >/= 150G/l remained independent predictive factors of non-optimal response to IM. The adverse events (AE) of IM were moderate and tolerable. With the caveats that the monitoring of the disease was not optimal, response rates were similar to those reported in previous studies. It is clear to us that improvements should be made in treatment of AP-CML and high Sokal risk group of CP-CML. The frontline use of second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) is expected to improve the results of the first-line treatment of these high-risk Tunisian patients, but cost and accessibility of this therapy remain the problems in developing countries.","['Ben Lakhal, Raihane', 'Ghedira, Hela', 'Bellaaj, Hatem', 'Ben Youssef, Yosra', 'Menif, Samia', 'Manai, Zeineb', 'Bedoui, Manel', 'Lakhal, Amel', ""M'Sadek, Fehmi"", 'Elloumi, Moez', 'Khelif, Abderrahmane', 'Ben Romdhane, Neila', 'Laatiri, Mohamed Adnene', 'Ben Othmen, Tarek', 'Meddeb, Balkis']","['Ben Lakhal R', 'Ghedira H', 'Bellaaj H', 'Ben Youssef Y', 'Menif S', 'Manai Z', 'Bedoui M', 'Lakhal A', ""M'Sadek F"", 'Elloumi M', 'Khelif A', 'Ben Romdhane N', 'Laatiri MA', 'Ben Othmen T', 'Meddeb B']","['Hematology Department, Aziza Othmana University Hospital, Tunis, Tunisia. raihane.benlakhal@gmail.com.', 'Hematology Department, Military Hospital Tunis, Tunis, Tunisia.', 'Hematology Department, Hedi Chaker Hospital, Sfax, Tunisia.', 'Hematology Department, Farhat Hached Hospital, Sousse, Tunisia.', 'Biology, Institut Pasteur, Tunis, Tunisia.', 'Hematology Department, La Rabta Hospital, Tunis, Tunisia.', 'Hematology Department, Fattouma Bourguiba Hospital, Monastir, Tunisia.', 'Centre national de greffe de moelle osseuse, Tunis, Tunisia.', 'Hematology Department, Military Hospital Tunis, Tunis, Tunisia.', 'Hematology Department, Hedi Chaker Hospital, Sfax, Tunisia.', 'Hematology Department, Farhat Hached Hospital, Sousse, Tunisia.', 'Hematology Department, La Rabta Hospital, Tunis, Tunisia.', 'Hematology Department, Fattouma Bourguiba Hospital, Monastir, Tunisia.', 'Centre national de greffe de moelle osseuse, Tunis, Tunisia.', 'Department of Haematology, Aziza Othmana University Hospital, Tunis, Tunisia.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20180106,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,,['NOTNLM'],"['CML', 'Clinical practice', 'Imatinib', 'Management', 'Survey', 'Tunisia']",2018/01/07 06:00,2018/03/10 06:00,['2018/01/07 06:00'],"['2017/11/04 00:00 [received]', '2017/12/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/10 06:00 [medline]', '2018/01/07 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00277-017-3224-2 [doi]', '10.1007/s00277-017-3224-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2018 Apr;97(4):597-604. doi: 10.1007/s00277-017-3224-2.

Participants were classified into quintiles based on their blood glucose measurement and were followed for a maximum of 17 years (mean +/- SD 9.2 +/- 4.7 years) to assess all-cause, cancer and non-cancer mortality rates. RESULTS: A non-linear relationship was observed between cancer mortality rates and blood glucose quintile after adjustment for age and sex. There was a significant association between the group with the highest blood glucose level and cancer-related death (multivariate Cox model, HR [95% CI] 1.17 [1.03, 1.34]), while the group with normoglycaemia showed no association with cancer-related deaths. We did not observe a relationship between blood glucose and all-cause or non-cancer mortality rates. An excess risk of death was observed in the highest blood glucose quintile for gastrointestinal cancer and leukaemia. Adjustments for diabetes and aspirin use did not modify the results. However, this excess risk disappeared with use of glucose-lowering agents (HR [95% CI] 1.03 [0.74, 1.43]). CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Hyperglycaemia is associated with significantly higher rates of cancer-related deaths, particularly in gastrointestinal cancer and leukaemia, but not with non-cancer-related deaths. The association is retained when taking into account confounding factors, including chronic aspirin treatment.","['Simon, Jean-Marc', 'Thomas, Frederique', 'Czernichow, Sebastien', 'Hanon, Olivier', 'Lemogne, Cedric', 'Simon, Tabassome', 'Pannier, Bruno', 'Danchin, Nicolas']","['Simon JM', 'Thomas F', 'Czernichow S', 'Hanon O', 'Lemogne C', 'Simon T', 'Pannier B', 'Danchin N']","['Centre IPC, 6-14 rue La Perouse, 75016, Paris, France.', 'Hopital Pitie Salpetriere, APHP, Paris, France.', 'Centre IPC, 6-14 rue La Perouse, 75016, Paris, France.', 'Hopital HEGP, APHP, Paris, France.', 'Hopitaux Universitaires Paris Ouest, APHP, Paris, France.', 'Centre IPC, 6-14 rue La Perouse, 75016, Paris, France.', 'Hopital Broca, APHP, Paris, France.', 'Hopital HEGP, APHP, Paris, France.', 'Hopitaux Universitaires Paris Ouest, APHP, Paris, France.', 'Inserm U894, Centre Psychiatrie et Neurosciences, Paris, France.', 'Hopital Saint Antoine, APHP, Universite Pierre et Marie Curie, Paris, France.', 'Centre IPC, 6-14 rue La Perouse, 75016, Paris, France. pannier@ipc.asso.fr.', 'Hopital Manhes, Fleury-Merogis, France. pannier@ipc.asso.fr.', 'Centre IPC, 6-14 rue La Perouse, 75016, Paris, France.', 'Hopital HEGP, APHP, Paris, France.', 'Universite Paris Descartes, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Faculte de medecine, Paris, France.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20180105,Germany,Diabetologia,Diabetologia,0006777,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Cancer', '*Epidemiology', '*Hyperglycaemia', '*Mortality']",2018/01/07 06:00,2019/01/29 06:00,['2018/01/07 06:00'],"['2017/09/13 00:00 [received]', '2017/12/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/29 06:00 [medline]', '2018/01/07 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00125-017-4540-8 [doi]', '10.1007/s00125-017-4540-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Diabetologia. 2018 May;61(5):1089-1097. doi: 10.1007/s00125-017-4540-8.

Novel, less toxic drugs are clearly needed. One of the most promising emerging therapeutic strategies for cancer treatment is targeted immunotherapy. Immune therapies have improved outcomes for patients with other hematologic malignancies including B-cell ALL; however no immune therapy has been successfully developed for T-ALL. We hypothesize targeting CD38 will be effective against T-ALL. We demonstrate that blasts from patients with T-ALL have robust surface CD38 surface expression and that this expression remains stable after exposure to multiagent chemotherapy. CD38 is expressed at very low levels on normal lymphoid and myeloid cells and on a few tissues of nonhematopoietic origin, suggesting that CD38 may be an ideal target. Daratumumab is a human immunoglobulin G1kappa monoclonal antibody that binds CD38, and has been demonstrated to be safe and effective in patients with refractory multiple myeloma. We tested daratumumab in a large panel of T-ALL patient-derived xenografts (PDX) and found striking efficacy in 14 of 15 different PDX. These data suggest that daratumumab is a promising novel therapy for pediatric T-ALL patients.","['Bride, Karen L', 'Vincent, Tiffaney L', 'Im, Soo-Yeon', 'Aplenc, Richard', 'Barrett, David M', 'Carroll, William L', 'Carson, Robin', 'Dai, Yunfeng', 'Devidas, Meenakshi', 'Dunsmore, Kimberly P', 'Fuller, Tori', 'Glisovic-Aplenc, Tina', 'Horton, Terzah M', 'Hunger, Stephen P', 'Loh, Mignon L', 'Maude, Shannon L', 'Raetz, Elizabeth A', 'Winter, Stuart S', 'Grupp, Stephan A', 'Hermiston, Michelle L', 'Wood, Brent L', 'Teachey, David T']","['Bride KL', 'Vincent TL', 'Im SY', 'Aplenc R', 'Barrett DM', 'Carroll WL', 'Carson R', 'Dai Y', 'Devidas M', 'Dunsmore KP', 'Fuller T', 'Glisovic-Aplenc T', 'Horton TM', 'Hunger SP', 'Loh ML', 'Maude SL', 'Raetz EA', 'Winter SS', 'Grupp SA', 'Hermiston ML', 'Wood BL', 'Teachey DT']","[""Division of Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Center for Childhood Cancer Research, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA."", ""Division of Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Center for Childhood Cancer Research, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA."", ""Division of Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Center for Childhood Cancer Research, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA."", ""Division of Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Center for Childhood Cancer Research, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA."", ""Division of Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Center for Childhood Cancer Research, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA."", 'Laura and Isaac Perlmutter Cancer Center at NYU Langone, New York University, New York, NY.', 'Janssen Biotech, Horsham, PA.', 'Department of Biostatistics, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL.', 'Department of Biostatistics, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL.', ""Carilion Children's Clinic, Roanoke, VA."", ""Division of Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Center for Childhood Cancer Research, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA."", ""Division of Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Center for Childhood Cancer Research, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA."", 'Baylor College of Medicine Dan L.

Venetoclax is a selective, orally bioavailable BCL-2 inhibitor with activity in patients with CLL, including those who are heavily pretreated or have 17p deletion. This phase 2 study prospectively evaluated venetoclax in patients with R/R CLL after ibrutinib or idelalisib; here we report on patients who received idelalisib as the last BCRi before enrollment. Venetoclax was initiated at 20 mg daily, followed by intrapatient ramp-up to 400 mg daily. Primary objectives included efficacy (objective response rate [ORR]) and safety of venetoclax. The study enrolled 36 patients who previously received idelalisib (ORR, 67% [24/36]); 2 patients achieved complete remission, and 1 had complete remission with incomplete bone marrow recovery. Median progression-free survival (PFS) has not yet been reached; estimated 12-month PFS was 79%. The most common adverse events (AEs; all grades) were neutropenia (56%), diarrhea (42%), upper respiratory tract infection (39%), thrombocytopenia (36%), nausea (31%), fatigue (28%), cough (22%), rash (22%), and anemia (22%). Grade 3 or 4 AEs were primarily hematologic (neutropenia [50%], thrombocytopenia [25%], and anemia [17%]). No patients experienced tumor lysis syndrome. Venetoclax demonstrated promising clinical activity and favorable tolerability in patients with CLL whose disease progressed during or after idelalisib therapy.

To compare the efficacy of the RIC and TCD approaches, we evaluated the outcomes of patients age >50 years with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) who underwent allo-HCT from an HLA-matched donor with one of these strategies. Baseline characteristics were comparable in the patients receiving TCD (n = 204) and those receiving RIC (n = 151), except for a higher proportion of unrelated donors (68% versus 40%; P < .001) and a higher comorbidity burden (Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation Comorbidity Index [HCT-CI] >/=3: 51% versus 38%; P < .001) in the TCD cohort. Analysis of outcomes at 3 years showed a higher chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD)/relapse-free survival (CRFS) (51% versus 7%; P < .001), lower incidences of grade II-IV acute GVHD (18% versus 46% at day +180) and chronic GVHD (6% versus 55% at 3 years; P < .001), and a lower incidence of relapse (19% versus 33% at 3 years; P = .001) in the TCD group compared with the RIC group. Relapse-free survival (RFS), overall survival (OS), and NRM were similar in the 2 groups. Combining transplantation approach (RIC versus TCD) and comorbidity burden (HCT-CI 0-2 versus >/=3), patients with an HCT-CI score of 0-2 seemed to benefit from the TCD approach. In conclusion, in this retrospective study, the use of a CD34(+) cell-selected graft and a myeloablative conditioning regimen was associated with higher CRFS and similar RFS and OS compared with unmodified allo-RIC in patients age >50 years with AML and MDS.","['Barba, Pere', 'Martino, Rodrigo', 'Zhou, Qin', 'Cho, Christina', 'Castro-Malaspina, Hugo', 'Devlin, Sean', 'Esquirol, Albert', 'Giralt, Sergio', 'Jakubowski, Ann A', 'Caballero, Dolores', 'Maloy, Molly', 'Papadopoulos, Esperanza B', 'Pinana, Jose Luis', 'Fox, Maria Laura', 'Marquez-Malaver, Francisco J', 'Valcarcel, David', 'Solano, Carlos', 'Lopez-Corral, Lucia', 'Sierra, Jorge', 'Perales, Miguel-Angel']","['Barba P', 'Martino R', 'Zhou Q', 'Cho C', 'Castro-Malaspina H', 'Devlin S', 'Esquirol A', 'Giralt S', 'Jakubowski AA', 'Caballero D', 'Maloy M', 'Papadopoulos EB', 'Pinana JL', 'Fox ML', 'Marquez-Malaver FJ', 'Valcarcel D', 'Solano C', 'Lopez-Corral L', 'Sierra J', 'Perales MA']","[""Department of Medicine, Adult Bone Marrow Transplant Service, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York; Hematology Department.

We have developed a highly sensitive droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) assay using commercially available regents with good performance throughout the range of clinically relevant chimerism measurements, including microchimerism. We tested the assay using spiked samples of known donor-recipient ratios and in clinical samples from HSCT recipients and patients enrolled on clinical trials of microtransplantation and third-party virus-specific T cells (VSTs). The levels of detection and quantification of the assay were .008% and .023%, with high levels of precision with samples of DNA content ranging from 1 to 300 ng DNA. From the panel of 29 insertion-deletion probes multiple informative markers were found for each of 43 HSCT donor-recipient pairs. In the case of third-party cellular therapies in which there were 3 DNA contributors (recipient, HSCT donor, and T-cell donor), a marker to detect the cellular product in a background of recipient and donor cells was available for 11 of 12 cases (92%). Chimerism by ddPCR was able to quantify chimerism in HSCT recipients and comparison against standard STR analysis in 8 HSCT patients demonstrated similar results, with the advantage of fast turnaround time. Persistence of donor microchimerism in patients undergoing microtransplantation for acute myeloid leukemia was detectable for up to 57 days in peripheral blood and bone marrow. The presence of microtransplant product DNA in bone marrow T cells after cell sorting was seen in the 1 patient tested. In patients receiving third-party VSTs for treatment of refractory viral infections, VST donor DNA was detected at low levels in 7 of 9 cases. ddPCR offers advantages over currently available methods for assessment of chimerism in standard HSCT and cellular therapies.","['Kliman, David', 'Castellano-Gonzalez, Gloria', 'Withers, Barbara', 'Street, Janine', 'Tegg, Elizabeth', 'Mirochnik, Oksana', 'Lai, Joey', 'Clancy, Leighton', 'Gottlieb, David', 'Blyth, Emily']","['Kliman D', 'Castellano-Gonzalez G', 'Withers B', 'Street J', 'Tegg E', 'Mirochnik O', 'Lai J', 'Clancy L', 'Gottlieb D', 'Blyth E']","['Westmead Institute of Medical Research, University of Sydney, Westmead, Australia.', 'Westmead Institute of Medical Research, University of Sydney, Westmead, Australia.', 'Westmead Institute of Medical Research, University of Sydney, Westmead, Australia; Sydney Medical School, University of Sydney, Camperdown, Australia.', 'Westmead Institute of Medical Research, University of Sydney, Westmead, Australia.', 'Sydney Medical School, University of Sydney, Camperdown, Australia; Institute of Clinical Pathology and Medical Research (ICPMR), NSW Health Pathology, Westmead, Australia.', 'Institute of Clinical Pathology and Medical Research (ICPMR), NSW Health Pathology, Westmead, Australia.', 'Westmead Institute of Medical Research, University of Sydney, Westmead, Australia.', 'Westmead Institute of Medical Research, University of Sydney, Westmead, Australia; Institute of Clinical Pathology and Medical Research (ICPMR), NSW Health Pathology, Westmead, Australia; Sydney Cellular Therapies Laboratory, Westmead, Australia.', 'Westmead Institute of Medical Research, University of Sydney, Westmead, Australia; Sydney Medical School, University of Sydney, Camperdown, Australia; Sydney Cellular Therapies Laboratory, Westmead, Australia; Blood and Marrow Transplant Unit, Department of Haematology, Westmead Hospital, Westmead, Australia.', 'Westmead Institute of Medical Research, University of Sydney, Westmead, Australia; Sydney Medical School, University of Sydney, Camperdown, Australia; Sydney Cellular Therapies Laboratory, Westmead, Australia; Blood and Marrow Transplant Unit, Department of Haematology, Westmead Hospital, Westmead, Australia.

All the compounds are described herein for the first time. The structure-activity relationships indicated that the presence of chlorine atom at the 2-position was crucial for the antiproliferative activity. Further, the electrochemical properties of the representative compounds (7e, 8e and 9e) were evaluated and a definite correlation between the redox potential and the antiproliferative activity. The most potent compound 9e displayed significant anti-leukemic activity with IC50 value of 3.8muM in HL-60 cells and weak cytotoxicity with IC50 of 40.7muM in normal cells WI-38. In mechanistic study for 9e, the increased numbers of apoptotic cells and increased cell population at G2/M phase correlated with ROS generation. Together, our results suggested that the derivatives of 2-chlorine-1,4-naphthoquinone might be the promising candidates for the treatment of promyelocytic leukemia.","['Li, Kun', 'Wang, Baitao', 'Zheng, Lifang', 'Yang, Kun', 'Li, Yuanyuan', 'Hu, Minmin', 'He, Dian']","['Li K', 'Wang B', 'Zheng L', 'Yang K', 'Li Y', 'Hu M', 'He D']","['School of Pharmacy, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730000, China.', 'School of Pharmacy, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730000, China; Institute of Biology Co.

This issue could be eliminated by grafting isolated preantral follicles. Collagenase NB6 is an enzyme produced under good manufacturing practices (GMP) in compliance with requirements for tissue engineering and transplantation in humans and thus can be used to isolate preantral follicles from ovarian tissue in the framework of further clinical applications. Multicolor flow cytometry is an effective tool to evaluate the potential contamination of follicular suspensions by leukemic cells. METHODS: The efficiency of collagenase NB6 was evaluated in comparison to collagenase type IA and Liberase DH, in terms of yield, morphology and viability. A short-term in vitro culture of follicles isolated with collagenase NB6 was conducted for 3 days in a fibrin matrix. A modelization procedure was carried out to detect the presence of leukemic cells in follicular suspensions using multicolor flow cytometry (MFC). RESULTS: No statistical differences were found between collagenase NB6, Liberase DH (p = 0.386) and collagenase type IA (p = 0.171) regarding the number of human preantral follicles isolated. The mean diameter of isolated follicles was significantly lower with collagenase NB6 (p < 0.0001). The survival rate of isolated follicles was 93.4% (n = 272) using collagenase NB6 versus 94.9% (n = 198) with Liberase DH and 92.6% (n = 298) using collagenase type IA. Even after 3 days of in vitro culture in a fibrin scaffold, most of the isolated follicles were still alive after using collagenase NB6 (90.7% of viable follicles; n = 339). The rate of isolated Ki67-positive follicles was 29 +/- 9.19% before culture and 45 +/- 1.41% after 3 days. In 23 out of 24 follicular suspensions analyzed, the detection of leukemic cells by MFC was negative. The purification had no significant impact on follicle viability. CONCLUSION: The isolation and purification of human preantral follicles were performed following good manufacturing practices for cell therapy. Multicolor flow cytometry was able to confirm that final follicular suspensions were free from leukemic cells. This safe isolation technique using collagenase NB6 can be considered for future clinical applications.","['Mouloungui, Elodie', 'Zver, Tristan', 'Roux, Christophe', 'Amiot, Clotilde']","['Mouloungui E', 'Zver T', 'Roux C', 'Amiot C']","['University Bourgogne Franche-Comte, INSERM, EFS BFC, UMR1098, Interactions Hote-Greffon-Tumeur/Ingenierie Cellulaire et Genique, F-25000, Besancon, France.', 'University Bourgogne Franche-Comte, INSERM, EFS BFC, UMR1098, Interactions Hote-Greffon-Tumeur/Ingenierie Cellulaire et Genique, F-25000, Besancon, France.', 'Department of Reproductive Medicine and Biology, Cryobiology, University Hospital of Besancon, 3 boulevard Fleming, 25000, Besancon Cedex, France.', 'University Bourgogne Franche-Comte, INSERM, EFS BFC, UMR1098, Interactions Hote-Greffon-Tumeur/Ingenierie Cellulaire et Genique, F-25000, Besancon, France.', 'INSERM CIC-1431, University Hospital of Besancon, Clinical Investigation Center in Biotherapy, F-25000, Besancon, France.', 'Department of Reproductive Medicine and Biology, Cryobiology, University Hospital of Besancon, 3 boulevard Fleming, 25000, Besancon Cedex, France.', 'University Bourgogne Franche-Comte, INSERM, EFS BFC, UMR1098, Interactions Hote-Greffon-Tumeur/Ingenierie Cellulaire et Genique, F-25000, Besancon, France. clotilde.amiot@univ-fcomte.fr.', 'INSERM CIC-1431, University Hospital of Besancon, Clinical Investigation Center in Biotherapy, F-25000, Besancon, France. clotilde.amiot@univ-fcomte.fr.', 'Department of Reproductive Medicine and Biology, Cryobiology, University Hospital of Besancon, 3 boulevard Fleming, 25000, Besancon Cedex, France. clotilde.amiot@univ-fcomte.fr.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20180105,England,J Ovarian Res,Journal of ovarian research,101474849,PMC5756359,['NOTNLM'],"['Collagenase NB6', 'Good manufacturing practices', 'Human follicle isolation', 'Leukemic cell purification']",2018/01/07 06:00,2018/08/09 06:00,['2018/01/07 06:00'],"['2017/08/24 00:00 [received]', '2017/12/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/01/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/08/09 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13048-017-0376-6 [doi]', '10.1186/s13048-017-0376-6 [pii]']",epublish,J Ovarian Res. 2018 Jan 5;11(1):4. doi: 10.1186/s13048-017-0376-6.,20180808,1,['EC 3.4.24.- (Collagenases)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Collagenases/metabolism', '*Cryopreservation', 'Female', '*Fertility Preservation/methods', 'Humans', '*Leukemia', 'Oocyte Retrieval/methods', 'Ovarian Follicle/*cytology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Selinexor, an exportin 1 (XPO1/CRM1) inhibitor, has demonstrated anti-leukemia activity as a single agent, as well as in combination with anthracyclines and/or DNA-damaging agents. METHODS: We report the findings of a phase I dose escalation trial with cohort expansion in 20 patients with newly diagnosed or relapsed/refractory AML that combined selinexor with age-adjusted high-dose cytarabine and mitoxantrone (HiDAC/Mito). RESULTS: Three (15%) patients received the initial dose of 60 mg of selinexor (~ 35 mg/m(2)), and 17 (85%) received the target level of 80 mg (~ 50 mg/m(2)). No dose-limiting toxicities were observed. Common adverse events included febrile neutropenia (70%), diarrhea (40%), anorexia (30%), electrolyte abnormalities (30%), bacteremia (25%), cardiac toxicities (25%), fatigue (25%), and nausea/vomiting (25%). None were unexpected given the HiDAC/Mito regimen. Serious adverse events occurred in 6 (30%) patients; one was fatal. Ten (50%) patients achieved a complete remission (CR), 3 (15%) achieved CR with incomplete recovery (CRi), 1 (5%) achieved partial remission (PR), and 6 (30%) had progressive disease for an overall response rate (ORR) of 70%. Eight of 14 (57%) responders proceeded to allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Correlative studies of WT1 levels showed persistently detectable levels in patients who either did not respond or relapsed quickly after induction. CONCLUSION: The selinexor/HiDAC/Mito regimen is feasible and tolerable at selinexor doses of 80 mg/day (~ 50 mg/m(2)/day) twice weekly. The recommended phase II dose is 80 mg and warrants further study in this combination. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov , NCT02573363 .

METHODS: Adults newly-diagnosed with AML who received standard induction chemotherapy in an inpatient setting were identified from the Truven Health Analytics MarketScan (2006-2015) and SEER-Medicare (2007-2011) databases. Patients were observed from induction therapy start to the first of hematopoietic stem cell transplant, 180 days after induction discharge, health plan enrollment/data availability end, or death. Induction and consolidation chemotherapy were identified using Diagnosis-Related Group codes (chemotherapy with acute leukemia) or procedure codes for AML chemotherapy administration. AML treatment episode setting (inpatient or outpatient), duration, and costs (2015 USD, payers' perspective) were described for commercially insured patients and Medicare beneficiaries. RESULTS: In total, 459 commercially insured patients and 563 Medicare beneficiaries (mean age = 54 and 66 years; 53% and 54% male; respectively) were identified. For induction therapy, mean costs were $145,189 for commercially insured patients and $85,734 for Medicare beneficiaries, and median inpatient duration was 31 days (both). Following induction, 64% of commercially insured patients and 53% of Medicare beneficiaries had >/=1 consolidation cycle; 75% and 65% of consolidation cycles were in an inpatient setting, respectively. For consolidation cycles, in the inpatient setting, mean costs were $28,137 for commercially insured patients and $28,843 for Medicare beneficiaries, median cycle duration was 6 days (both); in the outpatient setting, mean costs were $11,271 for commercially insured patients and $5,803 Medicare beneficiaries, median duration was 5 days (both). LIMITATIONS: Granular information on chemotherapy type administered was unavailable. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first exploratory study providing a complete picture of recent AML treatment patterns and management costs among commercially insured patients and Medicare beneficiaries. There is substantial heterogeneity in the management and costs of AML.","['Stein, Eytan M', 'Bonifacio, Gaetano', 'Latremouille-Viau, Dominick', 'Guerin, Annie', 'Shi, Sherry', 'Gagnon-Sanschagrin, Patrick', 'Briggs, Owanate', 'Joseph, George J']","['Stein EM', 'Bonifacio G', 'Latremouille-Viau D', 'Guerin A', 'Shi S', 'Gagnon-Sanschagrin P', 'Briggs O', 'Joseph GJ']","['a Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center , New York , NY , USA.', 'b Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation , East Hanover , NJ , USA.', 'c Analysis Group, Inc. , Montreal , Quebec , Canada.', 'c Analysis Group, Inc. , Montreal , Quebec , Canada.', 'c Analysis Group, Inc. , Montreal , Quebec , Canada.', 'c Analysis Group, Inc. , Montreal , Quebec , Canada.', 'b Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation , East Hanover , NJ , USA.', 'b Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation , East Hanover , NJ , USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20180122,England,J Med Econ,Journal of medical economics,9892255,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'consolidation cycle', 'costs', 'healthcare resource utilization', 'hematopoietic stem cell transplant', 'induction therapy', 'treatment patterns']",2018/01/07 06:00,2018/11/06 06:00,['2018/01/07 06:00'],"['2018/01/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/11/06 06:00 [medline]', '2018/01/07 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/13696998.2018.1425209 [doi]'],ppublish,J Med Econ. 2018 Jun;21(6):556-563. doi: 10.1080/13696998.2018.1425209.

The present study examines the impact of perforin gene variation on the clinical outcome in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients. The study enrolled 312 children aged 1-18 years, treated for ALL. PRF1 gene variants were analyzed through direct DNA sequencing. Variation in rs885822 was found to be associated with overall survival: patients carrying the GG genotype demonstrated a significantly increased risk of death compared to those carrying the A allele, independently of ALL risk groups (HR 3.13, 95%CI 1.16-7.8, p=0.014). The effect was even more pronounced in high-risk ALL patients (p=0.006). On the other hand, the presence of the rs35947132 minor A allele was slightly protective with regard to overall prognosis (p=0.047). No differences in relapse-free survival were observed with regard to genotypes. The results of the study may imply that perforin gene variation has a role in modifying mortality in childhood ALL.","['Jaworowska, Aleksandra', 'Pastorczak, Agata', 'Trelinska, Joanna', 'Wypyszczak, Kamila', 'Borowiec, Maciej', 'Fendler, Wojciech', 'Sedek, Lukasz', 'Szczepanski, Tomasz', 'Ploski, Rafal', 'Mlynarski, Wojciech']","['Jaworowska A', 'Pastorczak A', 'Trelinska J', 'Wypyszczak K', 'Borowiec M', 'Fendler W', 'Sedek L', 'Szczepanski T', 'Ploski R', 'Mlynarski W']","['Department of Pediatrics, Oncology, Hematology and Diabetology, Medical University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Oncology, Hematology and Diabetology, Medical University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Oncology, Hematology and Diabetology, Medical University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Oncology, Hematology and Diabetology, Medical University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland.', 'Department of Clinical Genetics, Medical University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Oncology, Hematology and Diabetology, Medical University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland; Department of Biostatistics & Translational Medicine, Medical University of Lodz, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Zabrze, Medical University of Silesia, Katowice, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Zabrze, Medical University of Silesia, Katowice, Poland.', 'Department of Clinical Genetics, Medical University of Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Oncology, Hematology and Diabetology, Medical University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland.

We examine the leukaemia burden worldwide and highlight the distinct incidence patterns in order to elucidate explanatory factors that may support preventive measures and health resource planning. We aimed to estimate the global burden of leukaemia incidence according to the four major subtypes stratified by age and sex. METHODS: In this population-based study, we assessed leukaemia incidence for the major subtypes using the Cancer Incidence in Five Continents Volume X (CI5-X), which includes data from 290 cancer registries in 68 countries covering the diagnostic period 2003-07, for all ages and both sexes. We then extracted counts and incidence rates in 184 countries for the year 2012 from IARC's GLOBOCAN database of national estimates. We calculated age-specific incidence rates per 100 000 person-years and age-standardised rates (ASRs) using the world standard population by country, sex, age group, and where applicable, by major subtypes. We excluded from all analyses registries for which the total number of leukaemia cases was less than 100 or the proportion of microscopically verified (MV%) cases was less than 80% (2572 cases). FINDINGS: 717 863 cases between 2003-07 were included in this analysis. More than 350 000 new leukaemia cases were estimated in 2012. We observed substantial variation in incidence between and within world regions. The highest leukaemia incidence rates for both sexes were estimated in Australia and New Zealand (ASR per 100 000 11.3 in males and 7.2 in females), Northern America (10.5 in males and 7.2 in females), and western Europe (9.6 in males and 6.0 in females), and the lowest was in in western Africa (1.4 in males and 1.2 in females). Rates were generally higher in males than females with an overall male to female ratio of 1.4. In children, acute lymphoblastic leukaemia was the main subtype in all studied countries in both sexes, and characterised by a bimodal age-specific pattern. The subtype distribution was more diverse in adults, with a relatively higher proportion of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia in most European and North American countries, whereas rates of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia remained relatively high among adults in selected South American, Caribbean, Asian, and African populations. INTERPRETATION: Geographical disparities in leukaemia might partly be explained by quality of, and access to, health systems linked to resource levels, although there is probably a role for aetiological factors, including gene-environment interactions. The observed bimodal pattern could be due to different risk factors affecting different ages, and might include a genetic component.

MKI was given to block the effect of FLT3 ITD mutation which powers proliferation of blast cells. However, the known facts that sorafenib is more effective in patents post alloHSCT suggested that this MKI can augment the immune system surveillance on leukaemia. In the present study, we investigated in depth the effect of sorafenib on the alloreactivity seen post-transplant including that on leukaemia. The patients (i) responded to the treatment with cessation of blasts which lasted 1, 17 and 42+ months, (ii) developed skin lesions with CD3+ cell invasion of the epidermis, (iii) had marrow infiltrated with CD8+ lymphocytes which co-expressed PD-1 (programmed cell death protein 1 receptor, CD279) in higher proportions than those in the blood (163+/-32 x103 cells/mul vs 38+/-8 x103 cells/mul, p<0.001). The Lymphoprep fraction of marrow cells investigated for the expression of genes involved in lymphocyte activation showed in the patients with long lasting complete remission (CR) a similar pattern characterized by (i) a low expression of nitric oxide synthase 2 (NOS2) and colony stimulating factor 2 (CSF2) as well as that of angiopoietin-like 4 (ANGPTL4) (supporting the immune response and anti-angiogenic) genes, and (ii) higher expression of fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF1) and collagen type IV alpha 3 chain (COL4A3) as well as toll like receptor 9 (TLR9) and interleukin-12 (IL-12) (pro-inflammatory expression profile) genes as compared with the normal individual. The positive effect in one patient hardly justified the presence of unwanted effects (progressive chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGvHD) and avascular necrosis of the femur), which were in contrast negligible in the other patient.

Data regarding prevalence and risk factors for impairments in pulmonary function and cardiorespiratory fitness are limited, and reported findings are inconsistent and inconclusive. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In a cross-sectional study, 116 ALL survivors (median 5 years at diagnosis, 29 years at follow-up, 53% females) were examined, median 23 years after treatment with chemotherapy only. Individual cumulative doses of cytostatic agents were calculated. Methods included blood tests, echocardiography, pulmonary function tests and cardiorespiratory exercise test. RESULTS: Females had lower % predicted gas diffusing capacity (DLCO) than males (mean [SD] 84 [13] versus 97 [14], p < .001). Impairment in DLCO was found in 34% females versus 7% males, p < .001. In a multiple linear regression model, female gender, body mass index (BMI) and smoking were risk factors for reduced % predicted DLCO, with a borderline significant effect of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Impaired cardiorespiratory fitness was found in 42% of the survivors, with a borderline increased risk in females, p = .06. Smoking and BMI were risk factors for reduced % predicted VO2peak. Subjects exposed to anthracyclines had lower LVEF% and % predicted VO2peak than those not exposed, (mean [SD] 56.2 [4.3] versus 59.2 [5.2], p = .01 and 86.9 [18.4] versus 92.8 [18.4], p = .03, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Impairments in pulmonary function and cardiorespiratory fitness are common in very long-term survivors of childhood ALL. Risk factors are female gender, BMI and smoking. In order to preserve pulmonary function and cardiorespiratory fitness, we suggest increased attention and targeted advice on modifiable lifestyle factors such as smoking, inactivity and overweight.","['Myrdal, Ole Henrik', 'Kanellopoulos, Adriani', 'Christensen, Jon R', 'Ruud, Ellen', 'Edvardsen, Elisabeth', 'Kongerud, Johny', 'Sikkeland, Liv Ingunn', 'Lund, May B']","['Myrdal OH', 'Kanellopoulos A', 'Christensen JR', 'Ruud E', 'Edvardsen E', 'Kongerud J', 'Sikkeland LI', 'Lund MB']","['a Department of Respiratory Medicine , Oslo University Hospital, Rikshospitalet , Oslo , Norway.', 'b Institute of Clinical Medicine , University of Oslo , Oslo , Norway.', 'b Institute of Clinical Medicine , University of Oslo , Oslo , Norway.', 'c Dept of Pediatric Oncology and Haematology , Oslo University Hospital, Rikshospitalet , Oslo , Norway.', 'd Department of Cardiology , Oslo University Hospital, Rikshospitalet , Oslo , Norway.', 'b Institute of Clinical Medicine , University of Oslo , Oslo , Norway.', 'c Dept of Pediatric Oncology and Haematology , Oslo University Hospital, Rikshospitalet , Oslo , Norway.', 'e The Norwegian School of Sport Sciences , Oslo , Norway.', 'f Department of Pulmonary Medicine , Oslo University Hospital , Ulleval , Norway.', 'a Department of Respiratory Medicine , Oslo University Hospital, Rikshospitalet , Oslo , Norway.', 'b Institute of Clinical Medicine , University of Oslo , Oslo , Norway.', 'a Department of Respiratory Medicine , Oslo University Hospital, Rikshospitalet , Oslo , Norway.', 'b Institute of Clinical Medicine , University of Oslo , Oslo , Norway.', 'a Department of Respiratory Medicine , Oslo University Hospital, Rikshospitalet , Oslo , Norway.', 'b Institute of Clinical Medicine , University of Oslo , Oslo , Norway.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20180105,England,Acta Oncol,"Acta oncologica (Stockholm, Sweden)",8709065,,,,2018/01/06 06:00,2018/09/18 06:00,['2018/01/06 06:00'],"['2018/01/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/09/18 06:00 [medline]', '2018/01/06 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/0284186X.2017.1423177 [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Oncol. 2018 May;57(5):658-664. doi: 10.1080/0284186X.2017.1423177.

It is predominately metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A. The study objective was to determine the effect of different dosage regimens of ritonavir, a strong CYP3A inhibitor, on the pharmacokinetics of venetoclax in 20 healthy subjects. METHODS: In cohorts 1 and 2, subjects received single 10 mg doses of venetoclax in periods 1 and 2 and a single 50- or 100-mg dose of ritonavir in period 2. In cohort 3, subjects received 10-mg venetoclax doses on day 1 of period 1 and days 1 and 11 of period 2, and 50 mg ritonavir daily on days 1 to 14 of period 2. RESULTS: Single doses of 50 and 100 mg ritonavir increased the venetoclax maximum concentration (Cmax) 2.3- to 2.4-fold compared to venetoclax alone and the area under the curve (AUC) 6.1- and 8.1-fold, respectively. Daily 50 mg ritonavir resulted in a 2.4- and 7.9-fold increase in venetoclax Cmax and AUC, respectively. Administration of 50 mg ritonavir daily saturated CYP3A inhibition and completely inhibited the formation of the major venetoclax metabolite M27. Time-dependent CYP3A inhibition with daily 50 mg ritonavir was offset by ritonavir CYP3A induction, resulting in a limited net increase in CYP3A inhibition with multiple doses. CONCLUSION: After completion of the dose ramp-up, venetoclax dose reductions of at least 75% are recommended when administered concomitantly with strong CYP3A inhibitors to maintain venetoclax exposures within the established therapeutic window for CLL treatment.","['Freise, Kevin J', 'Hu, Beibei', 'Salem, Ahmed Hamed']","['Freise KJ', 'Hu B', 'Salem AH']","['AbbVie Inc., 1 North Waukegan Road, North Chicago, IL, 60064, USA.', 'AbbVie Inc., 1 North Waukegan Road, North Chicago, IL, 60064, USA.', 'AbbVie Inc., 1 North Waukegan Road, North Chicago, IL, 60064, USA. ahmed.salem@abbvie.com.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacy, Faculty of Pharmacy, Ain Shams University, Cairo, Egypt. ahmed.salem@abbvie.com.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20180104,Germany,Eur J Clin Pharmacol,European journal of clinical pharmacology,1256165,,['NOTNLM'],"['ABT-199/GDC-0199', 'CYP3A', 'Interaction', 'Pharmacokinetics', 'Ritonavir', 'Venetoclax']",2018/01/06 06:00,2018/09/05 06:00,['2018/01/06 06:00'],"['2017/08/17 00:00 [received]', '2017/12/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/09/05 06:00 [medline]', '2018/01/06 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00228-017-2403-3 [doi]', '10.1007/s00228-017-2403-3 [pii]']",ppublish,Eur J Clin Pharmacol. 2018 Apr;74(4):413-421. doi: 10.1007/s00228-017-2403-3.

However, the predictive value of pretreatment platelet count remains obscure in de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML) excluding acute promyelocytic leukemia (M3). Methods: We conducted a retrospective review of 209 patients with de novo non-M3 AML in our institute over a period of 8 years (2007-2015). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to determine the optimal platelet (PLT) cutoff in patients. We analyzed the overall survival (OS) and disease free survival (DFS) using the log-rank test and Cox regression analysis. Results: By defining the platelet count 50 x 10(9)/L and 120 x 10(9)/L as two cut-off points, we categorized the patients into three groups: low (<50 x 10(9)/L), medium (50-120 x 10(9)/L) and high (>120 x 10(9)/L). On univariate analysis, patients with medium platelet count had longer OS and DFS than those with low or high platelet count. However, the multivariate analysis showed that only longer DFS was observed in patients with medium platelet count than those with low or high platelet count. Conclusion: Our findings indicate that pretreatment platelet count has a predictive value for the prognosis of patients with non-M3 AML.","['Zhang, Qianying', 'Dai, Kanchun', 'Bi, Laixi', 'Jiang, Songfu', 'Han, Yixiang', 'Yu, Kang', 'Zhang, Shenghui']","['Zhang Q', 'Dai K', 'Bi L', 'Jiang S', 'Han Y', 'Yu K', 'Zhang S']","['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, China.', 'Central Laboratory, The First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, China.', 'Division of Clinical Research, The First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20171221,United States,PeerJ,PeerJ,101603425,PMC5742276,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Disease-free survival', 'Overall survival', 'Pretreatment platelet count']",2018/01/06 06:00,2018/01/06 06:01,['2018/01/06 06:00'],"['2017/08/31 00:00 [received]', '2017/11/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/01/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/06 06:01 [medline]']","['10.7717/peerj.4139 [doi]', '4139 [pii]']",epublish,PeerJ. 2017 Dec 21;5:e4139. doi: 10.7717/peerj.4139. eCollection 2017.,,,,,,,,['The authors declare there are no competing interests.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our previous genome-wide transcriptomic data unexpectedly showed that genes encoding a multitude of neutrophil primary granule proteins (NPGPs) were markedly downregulated during the end period of eosinophilic terminal differentiation when cord blood (CB) cluster of differentiation (CD) 34(+) cells were induced to differentiate toward the eosinophil lineage during a 24-day culture period. Accordingly, this study aimed to examine whether NPGP genes were expressed on the way to eosinophil terminal differentiation stage and to compare their expression kinetics with that of genes encoding eosinophil-specific granule proteins (ESGPs). Transcripts of all NPGP genes examined, including proteinase 3, myeloperoxidase, cathepsin G (CTSG), and neutrophil elastase, reached a peak at day 12 and sharply declined thereafter, while transcript of ESGP genes including major basic protein 1 (MBP1) attained maximum expression at days 18 or 24. Growth factor independent 1 (GFI1) and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (C/EBPA), transactivators for the NPGP genes, were expressed immediately before the NPGP genes, whereas expression of C/EBPA, GATA1, and GATA2 kinetically paralleled that of eosinophil granule protein genes. The expression kinetics of NPGPs and ESGPs were duplicated upon differentiation of the eosinophilic leukemia cell line (EoL-1) immature eosinophilic cells. Importantly, confocal image analysis showed that CTSG was strongly coexpressed with MBP1 in differentiating CB eosinophils at days 12 and 18 and became barely detectable at day 24 and beyond. Our results suggest for the first time the presence of an immature stage where eosinophils coexpress NPGPs and ESGPs before final maturation.","['Kim, Karam', 'Hwang, Sae Mi', 'Kim, Sung Min', 'Park, Sung Woo', 'Jung, Yunjae', 'Chung, Il Yup']","['Kim K', 'Hwang SM', 'Kim SM', 'Park SW', 'Jung Y', 'Chung IY']","['Department of Bionano Engineering, Hanyang University, Ansan 15588, Korea.', 'Department of Bionano Engineering, Hanyang University, Ansan 15588, Korea.', 'Department of Bionano Engineering, Hanyang University, Ansan 15588, Korea.', 'Division of Allergy and Respiratory Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, Soonchunhyang University Bucheon Hospital, Bucheon 14584, Korea.', 'Department of Microbiology, Gachon University School of Medicine, Incheon 21936, Korea.', 'Department of Bionano Engineering, Hanyang University, Ansan 15588, Korea.', 'Department of Molecular and Life Sciences, Hanyang University, Ansan 15588, Korea.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20171213,Korea (South),Immune Netw,Immune network,101137270,PMC5746611,['NOTNLM'],"['Cathepsin G', 'Cord blood', 'Eosinophils', 'Major basic protein 1', 'Neutrophils']",2018/01/06 06:00,2018/01/06 06:01,['2018/01/06 06:00'],"['2017/10/03 00:00 [received]', '2017/11/21 00:00 [revised]', '2017/11/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/01/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/06 06:01 [medline]']",['10.4110/in.2017.17.6.410 [doi]'],ppublish,Immune Netw. 2017 Dec;17(6):410-423. doi: 10.4110/in.2017.17.6.410.

They are positively selected in the thymic cortex and migrate to the medullary area, in which they differentiate into 3 different lineages. Promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF) modulates this process, and PLZF(high), PLZF(intermediate), and PLZF(low) iNKT cells are designated as NKT2, NKT17, and NKT1 cells, respectively. Analogous to conventional helper CD4 T cells, each subset expresses distinct combinations of transcription factors and produces different cytokines. In lymphoid organs, iNKT subsets have unique localizations, which determine their cytokine responses upon antigenic challenge. The lineage differentiation programs of iNKT cells are differentially regulated in various mice strains in a cell-intrinsic manner, and BALB/c mice contain a high frequency of NKT2 cells. In the thymic medulla, steady state IL-4 from NKT2 cells directly conditions CD8 T cells to become memory-like cells expressing Eomesodermin, which function as premade memory effectors. The genetic signature of iNKT cells is more similar to that of gammadelta T cells and innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) than of conventional helper T cells, suggesting that ILCs and innate T cells share common developmental programs.","['Kwon, Dong-Il', 'Lee, You Jeong']","['Kwon DI', 'Lee YJ']","['Academy of Immunology and Microbiology, Institute for Basic Science, Pohang 37673, Korea.', 'Division of Integrative Biosciences and Biotechnology, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang 37673, Korea.', 'Academy of Immunology and Microbiology, Institute for Basic Science, Pohang 37673, Korea.', 'Division of Integrative Biosciences and Biotechnology, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang 37673, Korea.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20171127,Korea (South),Immune Netw,Immune network,101137270,PMC5746607,['NOTNLM'],"['Growth and development', 'Natural killer T cells', 'Thymus gland']",2018/01/06 06:00,2018/01/06 06:01,['2018/01/06 06:00'],"['2017/09/24 00:00 [received]', '2017/10/27 00:00 [revised]', '2017/11/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/01/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/06 06:01 [medline]']",['10.4110/in.2017.17.6.365 [doi]'],ppublish,Immune Netw. 2017 Dec;17(6):365-377. doi: 10.4110/in.2017.17.6.365.

B cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and B cell lymphomas originate from various stages of development of B cells, which, unlike other cell types, are under intense selective pressure. The vast majority of newly generated B cells are autoreactive and die by negative selection at autoimmunity checkpoints (AICs). Owing to ubiquitous encounters with self-antigen, autoreactive B cells are eliminated by the overwhelming signalling strength of their autoreactive B cell receptor (BCR). A series of recent findings suggests that, despite malignant transformation, AICs are fully functional in B cell malignancies. This Opinion article proposes targeted engagement of AICs as a previously unrecognized therapeutic opportunity to overcome drug resistance in B cell malignancies.","['Muschen, Markus']",['Muschen M'],"['Department of Systems Biology, Beckman Research Institute and National Cancer Institute (NCI) Comprehensive Cancer Center, City of Hope, Arcadia, California 91006, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20180105,England,Nat Rev Cancer,Nature reviews.

Here we identify two members of the Trithorax group (TrxG) of modifiers, mixed-lineage leukemia 1 (MLL1), and 3 (MLL3), as central components of an activating epigenetic machinery that dynamically counteracts PcG repression. Preceding puberty, MLL1 changes the chromatin configuration at the promoters of Kiss1 and Tac3, two genes required for puberty to occur, from repressive to permissive. Concomitantly, MLL3 institutes a chromatin structure that changes the functional status of a Kiss1 enhancer from poised to active. RNAi-mediated, ARC-specific Mll1 knockdown reduced Kiss1 and Tac3 expression, whereas CRISPR-Cas9-directed epigenome silencing of the Kiss1 enhancer selectively reduced Kiss1 activity. Both interventions delay puberty and disrupt reproductive cyclicity. Our results demonstrate that an epigenetic switch from transcriptional repression to activation is crucial to the regulatory mechanism controlling the timing of mammalian puberty.","['Toro, Carlos A', 'Wright, Hollis', 'Aylwin, Carlos F', 'Ojeda, Sergio R', 'Lomniczi, Alejandro']","['Toro CA', 'Wright H', 'Aylwin CF', 'Ojeda SR', 'Lomniczi A']","['Primate Genetics Section/Division of Neuroscience, Oregon National Primate Research Center/Oregon Health and Science University, 505 NW 185th Ave, Beaverton, OR, 97006, USA.', 'Primate Genetics Section/Division of Neuroscience, Oregon National Primate Research Center/Oregon Health and Science University, 505 NW 185th Ave, Beaverton, OR, 97006, USA.', 'Primate Genetics Section/Division of Neuroscience, Oregon National Primate Research Center/Oregon Health and Science University, 505 NW 185th Ave, Beaverton, OR, 97006, USA.', 'Division of Neuroscience, Oregon National Primate Research Center/Oregon Health and Science University, 505 NW 185th Ave, Beaverton, OR, 97006, USA. ojedas@ohsu.edu.', 'Primate Genetics Section/Division of Neuroscience, Oregon National Primate Research Center/Oregon Health and Science University, 505 NW 185th Ave, Beaverton, OR, 97006, USA. lomniczi@ohsu.edu.']",['eng'],"['P51 OD011092/OD/NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HD084542/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'F32 HD086904/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 DK007680/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 HD007133/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20180104,England,Nat Commun,Nature communications,101528555,PMC5754362,,,2018/01/06 06:00,2018/01/25 06:00,['2018/01/06 06:00'],"['2017/07/19 00:00 [received]', '2017/12/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/01/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/25 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41467-017-02512-1 [doi]', '10.1038/s41467-017-02512-1 [pii]']",epublish,Nat Commun. 2018 Jan 4;9(1):57. doi: 10.1038/s41467-017-02512-1.,20180124,1,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Kisspeptins)', '0 (Mllt1 protein, rat)', '0 (Polycomb-Group Proteins)', '0 (Tachykinins)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CRISPR-Cas Systems', 'Chromatin', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental/*genetics', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Gene Silencing', 'Hypothalamus/*metabolism', 'Kisspeptins/genetics', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics/metabolism', 'Polycomb-Group Proteins/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Puberty/*genetics', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Tachykinins/genetics']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7355-7534', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4535-0103']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Elucidating the mechanisms responsible for the maintenance of leukemic cells, before and after treatment, is therefore critical to identify curative modalities. It has become increasingly clear that cell-autonomous mechanisms are not solely responsible for leukemia maintenance. Here, we report a role for Pml in mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in supporting leukemic cells of both CML and AML. Mechanistically, we show that Pml regulates pro-inflammatory cytokines within MSCs, and that this function is critical in sustaining CML-KLS and AML ckit(+) leukemic cells non-cell autonomously.","['Guarnerio, Jlenia', 'Mendez, Lourdes Maria', 'Asada, Noboru', 'Menon, Archita Venugopal', 'Fung, Jacqueline', 'Berry, Kelsey', 'Frenette, Paul S', 'Ito, Keisuke', 'Pandolfi, Pier Paolo']","['Guarnerio J', 'Mendez LM', 'Asada N', 'Menon AV', 'Fung J', 'Berry K', 'Frenette PS', 'Ito K', 'Pandolfi PP']","['Cancer Research Institute, Beth Israel Deaconess Cancer Center, Departments of Medicine and Pathology, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, 02215, USA.', 'Cancer Research Institute, Beth Israel Deaconess Cancer Center, Departments of Medicine and Pathology, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, 02215, USA.', 'Ruth L. and David S.

The lymphocytosis experienced by most patients under ibrutinib has previously been attributed to inhibition of BTK-dependent integrin and chemokine cues operating to retain the tumor cells in nodal compartments. Here, we show that the VLA-4 integrin, as expressed by CD49d-positive CLL, can be inside-out activated upon BCR triggering, thus reinforcing the adhesive capacities of CLL cells. In vitro and in vivo ibrutinib treatment, although reducing the constitutive VLA-4 activation and cell adhesion, can be overcome by exogenous BCR triggering in a BTK-independent manner involving PI3K. Clinically, in three independent ibrutinib-treated CLL cohorts, CD49d expression identifies cases with reduced lymphocytosis and inferior nodal response and behaves as independent predictor of shorter progression-free survival, suggesting the retention of CD49d-expressing CLL cells in tissue sites via activated VLA-4. Evaluation of CD49d expression should be incorporated in the characterization of CLL undergoing therapy with BCR inhibitors.","['Tissino, Erika', 'Benedetti, Dania', 'Herman, Sarah E M', 'Ten Hacken, Elisa', 'Ahn, Inhye E', 'Chaffee, Kari G', 'Rossi, Francesca Maria', 'Dal Bo, Michele', 'Bulian, Pietro', 'Bomben, Riccardo', 'Bayer, Elisabeth', 'Harzschel, Andrea', 'Gutjahr, Julia Christine', 'Postorino, Massimiliano', 'Santinelli, Enrico', 'Ayed, Ayed', 'Zaja, Francesco', 'Chiarenza, Annalisa', 'Pozzato, Gabriele', 'Chigaev, Alexandre', 'Sklar, Larry A', 'Burger, Jan A', 'Ferrajoli, Alessandra', 'Shanafelt, Tait D', 'Wiestner, Adrian', 'Del Poeta, Giovanni', 'Hartmann, Tanja Nicole', 'Gattei, Valter', 'Zucchetto, Antonella']","['Tissino E', 'Benedetti D', 'Herman SEM', 'Ten Hacken E', 'Ahn IE', 'Chaffee KG', 'Rossi FM', 'Dal Bo M', 'Bulian P', 'Bomben R', 'Bayer E', 'Harzschel A', 'Gutjahr JC', 'Postorino M', 'Santinelli E', 'Ayed A', 'Zaja F', 'Chiarenza A', 'Pozzato G', 'Chigaev A', 'Sklar LA', 'Burger JA', 'Ferrajoli A', 'Shanafelt TD', 'Wiestner A', 'Del Poeta G', 'Hartmann TN', 'Gattei V', 'Zucchetto A']","['Clinical and Experimental Onco-Hematology Unit, CRO Aviano National Cancer Institute, Aviano, Italy.', 'Clinical and Experimental Onco-Hematology Unit, CRO Aviano National Cancer Institute, Aviano, Italy.', 'Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD.', 'Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Rochester, MN.', 'Clinical and Experimental Onco-Hematology Unit, CRO Aviano National Cancer Institute, Aviano, Italy.', 'Clinical and Experimental Onco-Hematology Unit, CRO Aviano National Cancer Institute, Aviano, Italy.', 'Clinical and Experimental Onco-Hematology Unit, CRO Aviano National Cancer Institute, Aviano, Italy.', 'Clinical and Experimental Onco-Hematology Unit, CRO Aviano National Cancer Institute, Aviano, Italy.', 'Third Medical Department with Hematology, Medical Oncology, Hemostaseology, Infectious Diseases, and Rheumatology, Oncologic Center, Paracelsus Medical University, Salzburg, Austria.', 'Cancer Cluster Salzburg, Salzburg Cancer Research Institute-Laboratory for Immunological and Molecular Cancer Research, Salzburg, Austria.', 'Third Medical Department with Hematology, Medical Oncology, Hemostaseology, Infectious Diseases, and Rheumatology, Oncologic Center, Paracelsus Medical University, Salzburg, Austria.', 'Cancer Cluster Salzburg, Salzburg Cancer Research Institute-Laboratory for Immunological and Molecular Cancer Research, Salzburg, Austria.', 'Third Medical Department with Hematology, Medical Oncology, Hemostaseology, Infectious Diseases, and Rheumatology, Oncologic Center, Paracelsus Medical University, Salzburg, Austria.', 'Cancer Cluster Salzburg, Salzburg Cancer Research Institute-Laboratory for Immunological and Molecular Cancer Research, Salzburg, Austria.', 'Division of Hematology, S.

We also examined the association between volume of patients treated by hospitals and survival. METHODS: Incident cases (2001-12) were identified using comprehensive National Health Service admissions data for England, with follow-up to March 2013. Socioeconomic deprivation was based on census area of residence. Volume was assessed in a three-year subset of the data with consistent hospital provider codes. RESULTS: There were 2921 adults aged 18 or more years diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) in the 12-year time span, giving a crude annual incidence of 0.61/100,000 population. Five-year survival was 32% (1870 deaths). Compared with patients living in least deprived areas, survival was worse for patients living in intermediate and most deprived areas, with mortality hazard ratios 21% (95% CI 8-35%) and 16% (95% CI 3-30%) higher respectively. Hospitals treating low volumes of adults with ALL were associated with poorer survival. The adjusted mortality hazard ratio in this subset of 465 patients was 33% (95% CI 3-73%) higher in low volume hospitals. There was no evidence of association between socioeconomic deprivation and incidence. Rurality did not appear to be associated with incidence or survival. Incidence was higher in men but there was no evidence of a gender difference in survival. Survival improved over time. CONCLUSION: The associations between socioeconomic deprivation and survival and between volume and outcome for adults with ALL, if confirmed, are likely to have significant implications for the organisation of services for adults with ALL.","['Maheswaran, Ravi', 'Morley, Nick']","['Maheswaran R', 'Morley N']","['Public Health GIS Unit, School of Health and Related Research, University of Sheffield, Regent Court, 30 Regent Street, Sheffield, S1 4DA, UK. r.maheswaran@sheffield.ac.uk.', 'Department of Haematology, Royal Hallamshire Hospital, Glossop Road, Sheffield, S10 2JF, UK.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180104,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,PMC5755332,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia', '*Incidence', '*Mortality', '*Socioeconomic deprivation', '*Survival']",2018/01/06 06:00,2018/08/14 06:00,['2018/01/06 06:00'],"['2017/10/16 00:00 [received]', '2017/12/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/01/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/08/14 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12885-017-3975-0 [doi]', '10.1186/s12885-017-3975-0 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2018 Jan 4;18(1):25. doi: 10.1186/s12885-017-3975-0.,20180813,1,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Cancer Survivors', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'England/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*epidemiology/*pathology/therapy', 'Rural Population', 'Sex Characteristics', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Young Adult']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-3899-4421'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The therapeutic potential of retinoids is based on their key role in the regulation of cell differentiation, growth, and apoptosis, which provides a basis for their use both in cancer therapy and chemoprevention. Nevertheless, patients treated with retinoids often exhibit or develop resistance to this therapy. Although resistance to retinoids is commonly categorized as either acquired or intrinsic, resistance as a single phenotypic feature is usually based on the same mechanisms that are closely related or combined in both of these types. In this review, we summarize the most common changes in retinoid metabolism and action that may affect the sensitivity of a tumor cell to treatment with retinoids. The availability of retinoids can be regulated by alterations in retinol metabolism or in retinoid intracellular transport, by degradation of retinoids or by their efflux from the cell. Retinoid effects on gene expression can be regulated via retinoid receptors or via other molecules in the transcriptional complex. Finally, the role of small-molecular-weight inhibitors of altered cell signaling pathways in overcoming the resistance to retinoids is also suggested.","['Chlapek, Petr', 'Slavikova, Viera', 'Mazanek, Pavel', 'Sterba, Jaroslav', 'Veselska, Renata']","['Chlapek P', 'Slavikova V', 'Mazanek P', 'Sterba J', 'Veselska R']","['Laboratory of Tumor Biology, Department of Experimental Biology, Faculty of Science, Masaryk University, 61137 Brno, Czech Republic. chlapek@sci.muni.cz.', ""International Clinical Research Center, St. Anne's University Hospital, 65691 Brno, Czech Republic. chlapek@sci.muni.cz."", 'Laboratory of Tumor Biology, Department of Experimental Biology, Faculty of Science, Masaryk University, 61137 Brno, Czech Republic. slavikova@sci.muni.cz.', ""International Clinical Research Center, St. Anne's University Hospital, 65691 Brno, Czech Republic. slavikova@sci.muni.cz."", 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, University Hospital Brno and Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University, 62500 Brno, Czech Republic. mazanek.pavel@fnbrno.cz.', ""International Clinical Research Center, St. Anne's University Hospital, 65691 Brno, Czech Republic. sterba.jaroslav@fnbrno.cz."", 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, University Hospital Brno and Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University, 62500 Brno, Czech Republic. sterba.jaroslav@fnbrno.cz.', 'Laboratory of Tumor Biology, Department of Experimental Biology, Faculty of Science, Masaryk University, 61137 Brno, Czech Republic. veselska@sci.muni.cz.', ""International Clinical Research Center, St. Anne's University Hospital, 65691 Brno, Czech Republic. veselska@sci.muni.cz."", 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, University Hospital Brno and Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University, 62500 Brno, Czech Republic. veselska@sci.muni.cz.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20180103,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,PMC5796081,['NOTNLM'],"['cell differentiation', 'differentiation therapy', 'mechanisms of resistance', 'retinoids']",2018/01/06 06:00,2018/07/28 06:00,['2018/01/06 06:00'],"['2017/12/01 00:00 [received]', '2017/12/28 00:00 [revised]', '2017/12/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/01/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/07/28 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms19010132 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms19010132 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2018 Jan 3;19(1). pii: ijms19010132. doi: 10.3390/ijms19010132.,20180727,1,"['0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoids)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/metabolism', 'Retinoids/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects']",,,['The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite the current advances in the field of anticancer agents, rapidly developing resistance against different chemotherapeutic drugs and significantly higher off-target effects cause millions of deaths every year. Osthol is a natural coumarin isolated from Apiaceaous plants which has demonstrated several pharmacological effects, such as antineoplastic, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. We have attempted to summarize up-to-date information related to pharmacological effects and molecular mechanisms of osthol as a lead compound in managing malignancies. Electronic databases, including PubMed, Cochrane library, ScienceDirect and Scopus were searched for in vitro, in vivo and clinical studies on anticancer effects of osthol. Osthol exerts remarkable anticancer properties by suppressing cancer cell growth and induction of apoptosis. Osthol's protective and therapeutic effects have been observed in different cancers, including ovarian, cervical, colon and prostate cancers as well as chronic myeloid leukemia, lung adenocarcinoma, glioma, hepatocellular, glioblastoma, renal and invasive mammary carcinoma. A large body of evidence demonstrates that osthol regulates apoptosis, proliferation and invasion in different types of malignant cells which are mediated by multiple signal transduction cascades. In this review, we set spotlights on various pathways which are targeted by osthol in different cancers to inhibit cancer development and progression.","['Shokoohinia, Yalda', 'Jafari, Fataneh', 'Mohammadi, Zeynab', 'Bazvandi, Leili', 'Hosseinzadeh, Leila', 'Chow, Nicholas', 'Bhattacharyya, Piyali', 'Farzaei, Mohammad Hosein', 'Farooqi, Ammad Ahmad', 'Nabavi, Seyed Mohammad', 'Yerer, Mukerrem Betul', 'Bishayee, Anupam']","['Shokoohinia Y', 'Jafari F', 'Mohammadi Z', 'Bazvandi L', 'Hosseinzadeh L', 'Chow N', 'Bhattacharyya P', 'Farzaei MH', 'Farooqi AA', 'Nabavi SM', 'Yerer MB', 'Bishayee A']","['Pharmaceutical Sciences Research Center, School of Pharmacy, Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences, Kermanshah 67146, Iran. yshokoohinia@kums.ac.ir.', 'Department of Pharmacognosy and Biotechnology, School of Pharmacy, Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences, Kermanshah 67146, Iran. yshokoohinia@kums.ac.ir.', 'Pharmaceutical Sciences Research Center, School of Pharmacy, Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences, Kermanshah 67146, Iran. fataneh.jafari@yahoo.com.', 'Students Research Committee, School of Pharmacy, Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences, Kermanshah 67146, Iran. zeynabmohamadi47@yahoo.com.', 'Students Research Committee, School of Pharmacy, Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences, Kermanshah 67146, Iran. leilibazvandi@yahoo.com.', 'Pharmaceutical Sciences Research Center, School of Pharmacy, Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences, Kermanshah 67146, Iran. lhosseinzadeh90@yahoo.com.', 'Department of Clinical and Administrative Sciences, College of Pharmacy, Larkin University, Miami, FL 33169, USA.

G4 structures are liable for various biological functions; transcription, translation, cell aging as well as diseases such as cancer. These structures are therefore considered as important targets for the development of anticancer agents. Small organic heterocyclic molecules are well known to target and stabilize G4 structures. In this article, we have designed and synthesized 2,6-di-(4-carbamoyl-2-quinolyl)pyridine derivatives and their ability to stabilize G4-structures have been determined through the FRET melting assay. It has been established that these ligands are selective for G4 over duplexes and show a preference for the parallel conformation. Next, telomerase inhibition ability has been assessed using three cell lines (K562, MyLa and MV-4-11) and telomerase activity is no longer detected at 0.1 muM concentration for the most potent ligand 1c. The most promising G4 ligands were also tested for antiproliferative activity against the two human myeloid leukaemia cell lines, HL60 and K562.","['Das, Rabindra Nath', 'Chevret, Edith', 'Desplat, Vanessa', 'Rubio, Sandra', 'Mergny, Jean-Louis', 'Guillon, Jean']","['Das RN', 'Chevret E', 'Desplat V', 'Rubio S', 'Mergny JL', 'Guillon J']","['Universite de Bordeaux, ARNA laboratory, INSERM U1212, UMR CNRS 5320, UFR des Sciences Pharmaceutiques, 33076 Bordeaux CEDEX, France. rabindra.das@u-bordeaux.fr.', 'Universite de Bordeaux, INSERM U1053, Cutaneous Lymphoma Oncogenesis Team, 33076 Bordeaux CEDEX, France. edith.chevret@u-bordeaux.fr.', 'Universite de Bordeaux, INSERM U1035, Cellules souches hematopoietiques normales et leucemiques, UFR des Sciences Pharmaceutiques, 33076 Bordeaux CEDEX, France. vanessa.desplat@u-bordeaux.fr.', 'Universite de Bordeaux, ARNA laboratory, INSERM U1212, UMR CNRS 5320, UFR des Sciences Pharmaceutiques, 33076 Bordeaux CEDEX, France. sandra.rubio@u-bordeaux.fr.', 'Universite de Bordeaux, ARNA laboratory, INSERM U1212, UMR CNRS 5320, UFR des Sciences Pharmaceutiques, 33076 Bordeaux CEDEX, France. jean-louis.mergny@inserm.fr.', 'Institute of Biophysics of the CAS, v.v.i., Kralovopolska 135, 612 65 Brno, Czech Republic. jean-louis.mergny@inserm.fr.', 'Universite de Bordeaux, ARNA laboratory, INSERM U1212, UMR CNRS 5320, UFR des Sciences Pharmaceutiques, 33076 Bordeaux CEDEX, France. jean.guillon@u-bordeaux.fr.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20171230,Switzerland,Molecules,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",100964009,PMC6017375,['NOTNLM'],"['FRET-melting', 'G-quadruplex', 'G4 ligands', 'antiproliferative activity', 'cancer', 'circular dichroism', 'diquinolinyl-pyridine', 'telomerase']",2018/01/06 06:00,2019/04/26 06:00,['2018/01/06 06:00'],"['2017/12/08 00:00 [received]', '2017/12/20 00:00 [revised]', '2017/12/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/01/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/26 06:00 [medline]']","['molecules23010081 [pii]', '10.3390/molecules23010081 [doi]']",epublish,Molecules. 2017 Dec 30;23(1). pii: molecules23010081. doi: 10.3390/molecules23010081.,20190425,1,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (Quinolines)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*chemical synthesis/*pharmacology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Drug Design', '*G-Quadruplexes', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Ligands', 'Protein Binding', 'Pyridines/*chemical synthesis/*pharmacology', 'Quinolines/*chemical synthesis/*pharmacology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Telomerase/antagonists & inhibitors']",,,['The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Microbial production of indirubin has so far been achieved by supplementation of rather expensive substrates such as indole or tryptophan. Here, we report the development of metabolically engineered Escherichia coli strain capable of producing indirubin directly from glucose. First, the Methylophaga aminisulfidivorans flavin-containing monooxygenase (FMO) and E. coli tryptophanase (TnaA) were introduced into E. coli in order to complete the biosynthetic pathway from tryptophan to indirubin. Further engineering was performed through rational strategies including disruption of the regulatory repressor gene trpR and removal of feedback inhibitions on AroG and TrpE. Then, combinatorial approach was employed by systematically screening eight genes involved in the common aromatic amino acid pathway. Moreover, availability of the aromatic precursor substrates, phosphoenolpyruvate and erythrose-4-phosphate, was enhanced by inactivating the pykF (pyruvate kinase I) and pykA (pyruvate kinase II) genes, and by overexpressing the tktA gene (encoding transketolase), respectively. Fed-batch fermentation of the final engineered strain led to production of 0.056g/L of indirubin directly from glucose. The metabolic engineering and synthetic biology strategies reported here thus allows microbial fermentative production of indirubin from glucose.","['Du, Jikun', 'Yang, Dongsoo', 'Luo, Zi Wei', 'Lee, Sang Yup']","['Du J', 'Yang D', 'Luo ZW', 'Lee SY']","['Metabolic and Biomolecular Engineering National Research Laboratory, Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering (BK21 Plus Program), Institute for the BioCentury, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), 291 Daehak-ro, Yuseong-gu, Daejeon 34141, Republic of Korea.', 'Metabolic and Biomolecular Engineering National Research Laboratory, Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering (BK21 Plus Program), Institute for the BioCentury, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), 291 Daehak-ro, Yuseong-gu, Daejeon 34141, Republic of Korea.', 'Metabolic and Biomolecular Engineering National Research Laboratory, Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering (BK21 Plus Program), Institute for the BioCentury, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), 291 Daehak-ro, Yuseong-gu, Daejeon 34141, Republic of Korea.', 'Metabolic and Biomolecular Engineering National Research Laboratory, Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering (BK21 Plus Program), Institute for the BioCentury, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), 291 Daehak-ro, Yuseong-gu, Daejeon 34141, Republic of Korea; BioInformatics Research Center and BioProcess Engineering Research Center, KAIST, Daejeon 34141, Republic of Korea.

Methods: We carried out an umbrella review and comprehensively re-analyzed the data of dose-response meta-analyses on associations between BMI and risk of 20 specific cancers (bladder, brain, breast, colonic, rectal, endometrial, gallbladder, gastric, leukemia, liver, lung, melanoma, multiple myeloma, non-Hodgkins lymphoma, esophagus, ovarian, pancreatic, prostate, renal, thyroid) by adding big data or missed individual studies. Convincing evidence for an association was defined as a strong statistical significance in fixed-effects and random-effects meta-analyses at P < 0.001, 95% prediction interval (PI) excluded null, there was no large between-study heterogeneity and no small study effects. Suggestive evidence was defined as meeting the significance threshold for the random summary effects of P < 0.05, but 95% PI included the null. Weak evidence was defined as meeting the significance threshold for the random summary effects at a P < 0.05, but 95% PI included the null and there was large between-study heterogeneity or there were small study effects. Results: Convincing evidence for an association with BMI was detectable for six cancers (leukemia, multiple myeloma, pancreatic, endometrial, rectal, and renal cell carcinoma). Suggestive evidence was detectable for malignant melanoma, non-Hodgkins lymphoma, and esophageal adenocarcinoma. Weak evidence was detectable for brain and central nervous system tumors, breast, colon, gall bladder, lung, liver, ovarian, and thyroid cancer. No evidence was detectable for bladder, gastric, and prostate cancer. Conclusions: The association of increased BMI and cancer is heterogeneous across cancer types. Leukemia, multiple myeloma, pancreatic, endometrial, rectal, and renal cell carcinoma are convincingly associated with an increased BMI by dose-response meta-analyses.","['Choi, E K', 'Park, H B', 'Lee, K H', 'Park, J H', 'Eisenhut, M', 'van der Vliet, H J', 'Kim, G', 'Shin, J I']","['Choi EK', 'Park HB', 'Lee KH', 'Park JH', 'Eisenhut M', 'van der Vliet HJ', 'Kim G', 'Shin JI']","['Mo-Im Kim Nursing Research Institute, Yonsei University College of Nursing, Seoul.', 'Department of Nursing, Yonsei University Graduate of Nursing, Seoul, Korea.', ""Department of Pediatrics, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea; Severance Children's Hospital, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea."", 'Severance Hospital, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', ""Children's & Adolescent Services, Luton & Dunstable University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, Luton, UK."", 'Department of Medical Oncology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Nursing, College of Nursing, Keimyung University, Daegu.', ""Department of Pediatrics, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea; Severance Children's Hospital, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea; Institute of Kidney Disease Research, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.

Recent reports of germline TP53 variants in childhood hypodiploid acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) suggest that this type of leukemia is another manifestation of Li-Fraumeni syndrome; however, the pattern, prevalence, and clinical relevance of TP53 variants in childhood ALL remain unknown. Patients and Methods Targeted sequencing of TP53 coding regions was performed in 3,801 children from the Children's Oncology Group frontline ALL clinical trials, AALL0232 and P9900. TP53 variant pathogenicity was evaluated according to experimentally determined transcriptional activity, in silico prediction of damaging effects, and prevalence in non-ALL control populations. TP53 variants were analyzed for their association with ALL presenting features and treatment outcomes. Results We identified 49 unique nonsilent rare TP53 coding variants in 77 (2.0%) of 3,801 patients sequenced, of which 22 variants were classified as pathogenic. TP53 pathogenic variants were significantly over-represented in ALL compared with non-ALL controls (odds ratio, 5.2; P < .001). Children with TP53 pathogenic variants were significantly older at ALL diagnosis (median age, 15.5 years v 7.3 years; P < .001) and were more likely to have hypodiploid ALL (65.4% v 1.2%; P < .001). Carrying germline TP53 pathogenic variants was associated with inferior event-free survival and overall survival (hazard ratio, 4.2 and 3.9; P < .001 and .001, respectively). In particular, children with TP53 pathogenic variants were at a dramatically higher risk of second cancers than those without pathogenic variants, with 5-year cumulative incidence of 25.1% and 0.7% ( P < .001), respectively. Conclusion Loss-of-function germline TP53 variants predispose children to ALL and to adverse treatment outcomes with ALL therapy, particularly the risk of second malignant neoplasms.","['Qian, Maoxiang', 'Cao, Xueyuan', 'Devidas, Meenakshi', 'Yang, Wenjian', 'Cheng, Cheng', 'Dai, Yunfeng', 'Carroll, Andrew', 'Heerema, Nyla A', 'Zhang, Hui', 'Moriyama, Takaya', 'Gastier-Foster, Julie M', 'Xu, Heng', 'Raetz, Elizabeth', 'Larsen, Eric', 'Winick, Naomi', 'Bowman, W Paul', 'Martin, Paul L', 'Mardis, Elaine R', 'Fulton, Robert', 'Zambetti, Gerard', 'Borowitz, Michael', 'Wood, Brent', 'Nichols, Kim E', 'Carroll, William L', 'Pui, Ching-Hon', 'Mullighan, Charles G', 'Evans, William E', 'Hunger, Stephen P', 'Relling, Mary V', 'Loh, Mignon L', 'Yang, Jun J']","['Qian M', 'Cao X', 'Devidas M', 'Yang W', 'Cheng C', 'Dai Y', 'Carroll A', 'Heerema NA', 'Zhang H', 'Moriyama T', 'Gastier-Foster JM', 'Xu H', 'Raetz E', 'Larsen E', 'Winick N', 'Bowman WP', 'Martin PL', 'Mardis ER', 'Fulton R', 'Zambetti G', 'Borowitz M', 'Wood B', 'Nichols KE', 'Carroll WL', 'Pui CH', 'Mullighan CG', 'Evans WE', 'Hunger SP', 'Relling MV', 'Loh ML', 'Yang JJ']","[""Maoxiang Qian, Xueyuan Cao, Wenjian Yang, Cheng Cheng, Hui Zhang, Takaya Moriyama, Gerard Zambetti, Kim E.

METHODS: A total of 273 previously untreated patients with CLL from April 2004 and October 2015 were enrolled into this retrospective study. We analysed the T cell subsets of all patients and figured out the number of NK cells. Comparisons of NK cell count as continuous parameter in different groups were described using Mann-Whitney U test and the Kruskal-Wallis test. Kaplan-Meier method was used to survival analysis, and the Cox proportional hazards models were used for the estimation of prognostic factors. RESULTS: NK cell counts were calculated in 273 therapy-naive CLL patients, and higher number of NK cell was observed in those with Binet stage A/B, ZAP-70 < 20%, normal serum albumin and beta2-microglobulin levels. Using a NK cell count cut-off of 0.40 x 10(9)/L, patients with lower NK cell count (< 0.40 x 10(9)/L) had a significantly shorter overall survival (OS) than those with higher NK cell count (>/= 0.40 x 10(9)/L) (P = 0.0014). Multivariate analysis showed that NK cell counts remained its prognostic value. However, the effect of NK cell count on time to treatment was not significant. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that NK cell count is an independent prognostic marker for OS in patients with CLL and NK cell counts >/= 0.40 x 10(9)/L can routinely be used to identify patients with favorable survival.","['Wang, Wen-Ting', 'Zhu, Hua-Yuan', 'Wu, Yu-Jie', 'Xia, Yi', 'Wu, Jia-Zhu', 'Wu, Wei', 'Liang, Jin-Hua', 'Wang, Li', 'Fan, Lei', 'Li, Jian-Yong', 'Xu, Wei']","['Wang WT', 'Zhu HY', 'Wu YJ', 'Xia Y', 'Wu JZ', 'Wu W', 'Liang JH', 'Wang L', 'Fan L', 'Li JY', 'Xu W']","['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing, 210029, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Hematology of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, 210029, China.', 'Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Personalized Medicine, Nanjing, 210029, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing, 210029, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Hematology of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, 210029, China.', 'Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Personalized Medicine, Nanjing, 210029, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing, 210029, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Hematology of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, 210029, China.', 'Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Personalized Medicine, Nanjing, 210029, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing, 210029, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Hematology of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, 210029, China.', 'Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Personalized Medicine, Nanjing, 210029, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing, 210029, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Hematology of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, 210029, China.', 'Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Personalized Medicine, Nanjing, 210029, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing, 210029, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Hematology of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, 210029, China.', 'Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Personalized Medicine, Nanjing, 210029, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing, 210029, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Hematology of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, 210029, China.', 'Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Personalized Medicine, Nanjing, 210029, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing, 210029, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Hematology of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, 210029, China.', 'Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Personalized Medicine, Nanjing, 210029, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing, 210029, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Hematology of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, 210029, China.', 'Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Personalized Medicine, Nanjing, 210029, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing, 210029, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Hematology of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, 210029, China.', 'Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Personalized Medicine, Nanjing, 210029, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing, 210029, China. xuwei10000@hotmail.com.', 'Key Laboratory of Hematology of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, 210029, China. xuwei10000@hotmail.com.', 'Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Personalized Medicine, Nanjing, 210029, China. xuwei10000@hotmail.com.']",['eng'],"['81370657/National Natural Science Foundation of China', '81770166/National Natural Science Foundation of China', '81470328/National Natural Science Foundation of China', '81720108002/National Natural Science Foundation of China']",['Journal Article'],20180103,Germany,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol,Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology,7902060,,['NOTNLM'],"['Absolute NK cell count', 'Chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'Dynamic', 'Host immunity', 'Prognosis']",2018/01/05 06:00,2018/02/27 06:00,['2018/01/05 06:00'],"['2017/08/22 00:00 [received]', '2017/12/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/27 06:00 [medline]', '2018/01/05 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00432-017-2568-2 [doi]', '10.1007/s00432-017-2568-2 [pii]']",ppublish,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol. 2018 Mar;144(3):449-457. doi: 10.1007/s00432-017-2568-2.

We previously reported that GDC-0152 induced apoptosis in HL-60 cells in a caspase-dependent manner. In this study, we have focused on GDC-0152-induced autophagy and the relationship between apoptosis and autophagy. We found that GDC-0152 can evoke autophagy flux as confirmed by the upregulation of LC3 and downregulation of p62. The conversion of LC3I to LC3II verified the existence of autophagy flux further. GDC-0152 induced autophagy through downregulating B cell lymphoma 2 and Bcl-2-interacting myosin-like coiled-coil protein, and upregulating WD-repeat domain phosphoinositide-interacting protein 1. Pretreating HL-60 cells with autophagy inhibitor Bafolimycin A1 reduced GDC-0152-induced apoptosis. However, pretreatment with caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK had no effect on autophagy. Reactive oxygen species were released in GDC-0152-treated HL-60 cells but did not take part in the regulation of autophagy and apoptosis. In conclusion, our findings suggest that GDC-0152-induced autophagy can trigger apoptosis in HL-60 cells.","['Peiqi, Liang', 'Rong, Hu', 'Hongming, Dong', 'Zhuogang, Liu', 'Wei, Jiang', 'Miao, Miao']","['Peiqi L', 'Rong H', 'Hongming D', 'Zhuogang L', 'Wei J', 'Miao M']","['Hematology Department, Shengjing Hospital, China Medical University, Shenyang, China.', 'Hematology Department, Shengjing Hospital, China Medical University, Shenyang, China. hur@sj-hospital.org.', 'Anatomy Department, China Medical University, Shenyang, China.', 'Hematology Department, Shengjing Hospital, China Medical University, Shenyang, China.', 'Hematology Department, Shengjing Hospital, China Medical University, Shenyang, China.', 'Hematology Department, Shengjing Hospital, China Medical University, Shenyang, China.']",['eng'],['81500135/the National Natural Science Foundation of China'],['Journal Article'],20180103,Netherlands,Mol Cell Biochem,Molecular and cellular biochemistry,0364456,,['NOTNLM'],"['Apoptosis', 'Autophagy', 'GDC-0152', 'Leukemia']",2018/01/05 06:00,2018/09/18 06:00,['2018/01/05 06:00'],"['2017/07/19 00:00 [received]', '2017/12/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/09/18 06:00 [medline]', '2018/01/05 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s11010-017-3259-7 [doi]', '10.1007/s11010-017-3259-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biochem. 2018 Aug;445(1-2):135-143. doi: 10.1007/s11010-017-3259-7.

The value of clinical methylation assays for prognostic markers has not been extensively explored. We assess the prognostic implications of methylC-capture sequencing (MCC-Seq) in patients with de novo AML by integrating DNA methylation and genetic risk stratification. MCC-Seq assessed DNA methylation level in 44 samples. The differentially methylated regions associated with prognostic genetic information were identified. The selected prognostic DNA methylation markers were independently validated in two sets. MCC-Seq exhibited good performance in AML patients. A panel of 12 differentially methylated genes was identified with promoter hyper-differentially methylated regions associated with the outcome. Compared with a low M-value, a high M-value was associated with failure to achieve complete remission (p = 0.024), increased hazard for disease-free survival in the study set (p = 0.039) and poor overall survival in The Cancer Genome Atlas set (p = 0.038). Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and survival outcomes were not adversely affected by a high M-value (p = 0.271). Our study establishes that MCC-Seq is a stable, reproducible, and cost-effective methylation assay in AML. A 12-gene M-value encompassing epigenetic and genetic prognostic information represented a valid prognostic marker for patients with AML.","['Li, Yan', 'Zhao, Hongmei', 'Xu, Qingyu', 'Lv, Na', 'Jing, Yu', 'Wang, Lili', 'Wang, Xiaowen', 'Guo, Jing', 'Zhou, Lei', 'Liu, Jing', 'Chen, Guofeng', 'Chen, Chongjian', 'Li, Yonghui', 'Yu, Li']","['Li Y', 'Zhao H', 'Xu Q', 'Lv N', 'Jing Y', 'Wang L', 'Wang X', 'Guo J', 'Zhou L', 'Liu J', 'Chen G', 'Chen C', 'Li Y', 'Yu L']","['Department of Hematology and BMT Center, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing 100853, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Hainan Branch of Chinese PLA General Hospital, Sanya 572013, China.', 'Annoroad Gene Technology Co.

We evaluated the efficacy and feasibility of higher doses of sitagliptin to enhance engraftment of UCB in patients with hematological cancers. Fifteen patients, median age 41 (range, 18-59) years, received single UCB grafts matched at 4 (n=11) or 5 (n=4) of 6 HLA loci with median nucleated cell dose of 3.5 (range, 2.57-4.57) x10(7)/kg. Sitagliptin 600 mg every 12 hours was administered days -1 to +2. All patients engrafted by day 30, with 12 (80%) engrafting by day 21. The median time to neutrophil engraftment was 19 (range, 12-30) days. Plasma DPP-4 activity was better inhibited with a mean residual trough DPP-4 activity of 70%+/-19%. Compared to patients previously treated with 600 mg/day, sitagliptin 600 mg every 12 hours appeared to improve engraftment, supporting the hypothesis that more sustained DPP-4 inhibition is required. In-vivo inhibition of DPP-4 using high-dose sitagliptin compares favorably with other approaches to enhance UCB engraftment with greater simplicity, and may show synergy in combination with other strategies.","['Farag, Sherif S', 'Nelson, Robert', 'Cairo, Mitchell S', ""O'Leary, Heather A"", 'Zhang, Shuhong', 'Huntley, Carol', 'Delgado, David', 'Schwartz, Jennifer', 'Zaid, Mohammad Abu', 'Abonour, Rafat', 'Robertson, Michael', 'Broxmeyer, Hal']","['Farag SS', 'Nelson R', 'Cairo MS', ""O'Leary HA"", 'Zhang S', 'Huntley C', 'Delgado D', 'Schwartz J', 'Zaid MA', 'Abonour R', 'Robertson M', 'Broxmeyer H']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana, USA.', 'Indiana University Simon Cancer Center, Indianapolis, Indiana, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana, USA.', 'Indiana University Simon Cancer Center, Indianapolis, Indiana, USA.', 'Children and Adolescent Cancer and Blood Diseases Center and Department of Pediatrics, New York Medical College, Valhalla, New York, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana, USA.', 'Indiana University Simon Cancer Center, Indianapolis, Indiana, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana, USA.', 'Indiana University Simon Cancer Center, Indianapolis, Indiana, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana, USA.', 'Indiana University Simon Cancer Center, Indianapolis, Indiana, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Indianapolis, Indiana, USA.', 'Indiana University Simon Cancer Center, Indianapolis, Indiana, USA.']",['eng'],['R01 HL112669/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],['Journal Article'],20171127,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,PMC5746387,['NOTNLM'],"['CD26', 'DPP-4', 'cord blood', 'engraftment', 'leukemia']",2018/01/05 06:00,2018/01/05 06:01,['2018/01/05 06:00'],"['2017/10/03 00:00 [received]', '2017/10/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/01/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/05 06:01 [medline]']","['10.18632/oncotarget.22739 [doi]', '22739 [pii]']",epublish,Oncotarget. 2017 Nov 27;8(66):110350-110357. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.22739. eCollection 2017 Dec 15.,,66,,,,,,['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST The authors report no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Functional domain (FD) retention is a critical factor in the activity of transcription factor fusion genes (TFFGs). A systematic investigation of FD retention in TFFGs and their outcome (e.g. expression changes) in a pan-cancer study has not yet been completed. Here, we examined the FD retention status in 386 TFFGs across 13 major cancer types and identified 83 TFFGs involving 67 TFs that retained FDs. To measure the potential biological relevance of TFs in TFFGs, we introduced a Major Active Isofusion Index (MAII) and built a prioritized TFFG network using MAII scores and the observed frequency of fusion positive samples. Interestingly, the four TFFGs (PML-RARA, RUNX1-RUNX1T1, TMPRSS2-ERG, and SFPQ-TFE3) with the highest MAII scores showed 50 differentially expressed target genes (DETGs) in fusion-positive versus fusion-negative cancer samples. DETG analysis revealed that they were involved in tumorigenesis-related processes in each cancer type. PLAU, which encodes plasminogen activator urokinase and serves as a biomarker for tumor invasion, was found to be consistently activated in the samples with the highest MAII scores. Among the 50 DETGs, 21 were drug targetable genes. Fourteen of these 21 DETGs were expressed in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) samples. Accordingly, we constructed an AML-specific TFFG network, which included 38 DETGs in RUNX1-RUNX1T1 or PML-RARA positive samples. In summary, this study revealed several TFFGs and their potential target genes, and provided insights into the clinical implications of TFFGs.","['Kim, Pora', 'Ballester, Leomar Y', 'Zhao, Zhongming']","['Kim P', 'Ballester LY', 'Zhao Z']","['Center for Precision Health, School of Biomedical Informatics, The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, Houston, TX 77030, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, Houston, TX 77030, USA.', 'Center for Precision Health, School of Biomedical Informatics, The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, Houston, TX 77030, USA.', 'Human Genetics Center, School of Public Health, The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],['R01 LM012806/LM/NLM NIH HHS/United States'],['Journal Article'],20171124,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,PMC5746368,['NOTNLM'],"['PML-RARA', 'differential expression', 'functional domain retention', 'gene fusion network', 'transcription factor fusion gene']",2018/01/05 06:00,2018/01/05 06:01,['2018/01/05 06:00'],"['2017/07/18 00:00 [received]', '2017/10/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/01/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/05 06:01 [medline]']","['10.18632/oncotarget.22653 [doi]', '22653 [pii]']",epublish,Oncotarget. 2017 Nov 24;8(66):110103-110117. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.22653. eCollection 2017 Dec 15.,,66,,,,,,['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST The authors declare no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Following treatment with TKIs, the bone marrow microenvironment has been found to harbor a small pool of surviving leukemic CD34+ progenitor cells. The long-term survival of these leukemic cells has been attributed, at least in part, to the protective effects of bone marrow stroma. We found that the NOX-A12 'Spiegelmer', an L-enantiomeric RNA oligonucleotide that inhibits SDF-1alpha, showed in vitro and in vivo activity against BCR-ABL- and FLT3-ITD-dependent leukemia cells. NOX-A12 was sufficient to suppress SDF-1-induced migration in vitro. The combination of NOX-A12 with TKIs reduced cell migration in the same in vitro model of SDF-1-induced chemotaxis to a greater extent than either drug alone, suggesting positive cooperativity as a result of the SDF-1 blocking function of NOX-A12 and cytotoxicity resulting from targeted oncogenic kinase inhibition. These results are consistent with our in vivo findings using a functional pre-clinical mouse model of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), whereby we demonstrated the ability of NOX-A12, combined with the ABL kinase inhibitor, nilotinib, to reduce the leukemia burden in mice to a greater extent than either agent alone. Overall, the data support the idea of using SDF-1 inhibition in combination with targeted kinase inhibition to override drug resistance in oncogene-driven leukemia to significantly diminish or eradicate residual leukemic disease.","['Weisberg, Ellen L', 'Sattler, Martin', 'Azab, Abdel Kareem', 'Eulberg, Dirk', 'Kruschinski, Anna', 'Manley, Paul W', 'Stone, Richard', 'Griffin, James D']","['Weisberg EL', 'Sattler M', 'Azab AK', 'Eulberg D', 'Kruschinski A', 'Manley PW', 'Stone R', 'Griffin JD']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02215, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02215, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02215, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.', 'Noxxon Pharma, Max-Dohrn-Strasse 8-10, 10589 Berlin, Germany.', 'Noxxon Pharma, Max-Dohrn-Strasse 8-10, 10589 Berlin, Germany.', 'Novartis Institutes of Biomedical Research, CH-4002 Basel, Switzerland.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02215, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02215, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20171106,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,PMC5746358,['NOTNLM'],"['NOX-A12', 'SDF-1', 'chronic myeloid leukemia', 'drug resistance', 'nilotinib']",2018/01/05 06:00,2018/01/05 06:01,['2018/01/05 06:00'],"['2017/07/08 00:00 [received]', '2017/10/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/01/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/05 06:01 [medline]']","['10.18632/oncotarget.22409 [doi]', '22409 [pii]']",epublish,Oncotarget. 2017 Nov 6;8(66):109973-109984. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.22409. eCollection 2017 Dec 15.,,66,,,,,,"['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST D.E. and A.K. are employees of Noxxon Pharmaceuticals and', 'have a financial interest with Noxxon Pharmaceuticals.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

L-Asp is an important component of treatment regimens for Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL). Sensitivity to L-Asp is due to the absence of L-Asparagine synthetase (ASNS), the enzyme that catalyzes the biosynthesis of L-asparagine. ASNS gene is located on 7q21.3, and its increased expression in ALLs correlates with L-Asp resistance. Chromosome 7 monosomy (-7) is a recurrent aberration in myeloid disorders, particularly in adverse-risk Acute Myeloid Leukemias (AMLs) and therapy-related myeloid neoplasms (t-MN), that leads to a significant downregulation of the deleted genes, including ASNS. Therefore, we hypothesized that -7 could affect L-Asp sensitivity in AMLs. By treating AML cell lines and primary cells from pediatric patients with L-Asp, we showed that -7 cells were more sensitive than AML cells without -7. Importantly, both ASNS gene and protein expression were significantly lower in -7 AML cell lines, suggesting that haploinsufficiency of ASNS might induce sensitivity to L-Asp in AMLs. To prove the role of ASNS haploinsufficiency in sensitizing AML cells to L-Asp treatment, we performed siRNA-knockdown of ASNS in AML cell lines lacking -7, and observed that ASNS knockdown significantly increased L-Asp cytotoxicity. In conclusion, -7 AMLs showed high sensitivity to L-Asp treatment due to low expression of ASNS. Thus, L-Asp may be considered for treatment of AML pediatric patients carrying -7, in order to improve the outcome of adverse-risk AMLs and t-MN patients.","['Bertuccio, Salvatore Nicola', 'Serravalle, Salvatore', 'Astolfi, Annalisa', 'Lonetti, Annalisa', 'Indio, Valentina', 'Leszl, Anna', 'Pession, Andrea', 'Melchionda, Fraia']","['Bertuccio SN', 'Serravalle S', 'Astolfi A', 'Lonetti A', 'Indio V', 'Leszl A', 'Pession A', 'Melchionda F']","['Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Unit, Department of Pediatrics, S.Orsola-Malpighi Hospital, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.', 'Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Unit, Department of Pediatrics, S.Orsola-Malpighi Hospital, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.', 'Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Unit, Department of Pediatrics, S.Orsola-Malpighi Hospital, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.', '""Giorgio Prodi"" Cancer Research Center, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.', 'Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Unit, Department of Pediatrics, S.Orsola-Malpighi Hospital, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.', '""Giorgio Prodi"" Cancer Research Center, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.', 'Department of Woman and Child Health, Laboratory of Hematology-Oncology, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.', 'Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Unit, Department of Pediatrics, S.Orsola-Malpighi Hospital, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.', '""Giorgio Prodi"" Cancer Research Center, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.', 'Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Unit, Department of Pediatrics, S.Orsola-Malpighi Hospital, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20170619,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,PMC5746353,['NOTNLM'],"['ASNS gene', 'L-Asparaginase', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'monosomy chromosome 7']",2018/01/05 06:00,2018/01/05 06:01,['2018/01/05 06:00'],"['2016/11/16 00:00 [received]', '2017/06/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/01/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/05 06:01 [medline]']","['10.18632/oncotarget.18565 [doi]', '18565 [pii]']",epublish,Oncotarget. 2017 Jun 19;8(66):109915-109923. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.18565. eCollection 2017 Dec 15.,,66,,,,,,"['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST The authors do not have any conflicts of interest to', 'declare.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The objective of this study was to perform a detailed clinicopathologic study of patients with relapsed myeloid neoplasm following allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant for myelodysplastic syndrome. Methods: Pre-transplant, post-transplant, and relapse bone marrow and peripheral blood morphologic features (including dysplasia) were retrospectively evaluated by study authors. Clinical features and results of cytogenetic analysis and engraftment/chimerism studies were obtained from the medical record. Results: Our study describes 21 patients with a median time to relapse of 6 months (range 2-82). Ten of the patients relapsed with higher grade disease, including six with overt acute myeloid leukemia. Pre-transplant megakaryocyte dysplasia was associated with dysplastic megakaryocytes in the relapse specimen; however, neither erythroid dysplasia nor granulocytic dysplasia were associated with their counterpart in the relapse specimen. Relapse specimens had a lower marrow cellularity and higher blast percentage than pre-transplant disease.

Methods to better match patients to drugs are in high demand. We demonstrate a promising approach to identify robust molecular markers for targeted treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) by introducing: data from 30 AML patients including genome-wide gene expression profiles and in vitro sensitivity to 160 chemotherapy drugs, a computational method to identify reliable gene expression markers for drug sensitivity by incorporating multi-omic prior information relevant to each gene's potential to drive cancer. We show that our method outperforms several state-of-the-art approaches in identifying molecular markers replicated in validation data and predicting drug sensitivity accurately. Finally, we identify SMARCA4 as a marker and driver of sensitivity to topoisomerase II inhibitors, mitoxantrone, and etoposide, in AML by showing that cell lines transduced to have high SMARCA4 expression reveal dramatically increased sensitivity to these agents.","['Lee, Su-In', 'Celik, Safiye', 'Logsdon, Benjamin A', 'Lundberg, Scott M', 'Martins, Timothy J', 'Oehler, Vivian G', 'Estey, Elihu H', 'Miller, Chris P', 'Chien, Sylvia', 'Dai, Jin', 'Saxena, Akanksha', 'Blau, C Anthony', 'Becker, Pamela S']","['Lee SI', 'Celik S', 'Logsdon BA', 'Lundberg SM', 'Martins TJ', 'Oehler VG', 'Estey EH', 'Miller CP', 'Chien S', 'Dai J', 'Saxena A', 'Blau CA', 'Becker PS']","['Paul G.

One way in which gPr80 helps MLVs to escape host innate immune restriction is by increasing capsid stability, a feature that protects viral replication intermediates from being detected by cytosolic DNA sensors. gPr80 also increases the resistance of MLVs to deamination and restriction by mouse APOBEC3 (mA3). How the gPr80 accessory protein, with its three N-linked glycosylation sites, contributes to these resistance mechanisms is still not fully understood. Here we further characterized the function of gPr80 and, more specifically, revealed that the asparagines targeted for glycosylation in gPr80 also contribute to capsid stability through their parallel involvement in the Pr65 Gag structural polyprotein. In fact, we demonstrate that sensitivity to deamination by the mA3 and human A3 proteins is directly linked to capsid stability. We also show that full-length gPr80 is detected in purified viruses. However, our results suggest that gPr80 is inserted in the NexoCcyto orientation of a type I integral membrane protein. Additionally, our experiments have revealed the existence of a large population of Env-deficient virus-like particles (VLPs) harboring gPr80 inserted in the opposite (NcytoCexo) polarity, which is typical of type II integral membrane proteins. Overall this study provides new insight into the complex nature of the MLV gPr80 accessory protein.IMPORTANCE Viruses have evolved numerous strategies to infect, spread in, and persist in their hosts. Here we analyze the details of how the MLV-encoded glycosylated Gag (gPr80) protein protects the virus from being restricted by host innate immune defenses. gPr80 is a variant of the structural Pr65 Gag protein with an 88-amino-acid extended leader sequence that directs the protein for translation and glycosylation in the endoplasmic reticulum. This study dissects the specific contributions of gPr80 glycans and capsid stability in helping the virus to infect cells, spread, and counteract the effects of the host intrinsic restriction factor APOBEC3. Overall this study provides further insight into the elusive role of the gPr80 protein.","['Renner, Tyler Milston', 'Belanger, Kasandra', 'Lam, Cindy', 'Gerpe, Maria Carla Rosales', 'McBane, Joanne Eileen', 'Langlois, Marc-Andre']","['Renner TM', 'Belanger K', 'Lam C', 'Gerpe MCR', 'McBane JE', 'Langlois MA']","['Department of Biochemistry, Microbiology and Immunology, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Microbiology and Immunology, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Microbiology and Immunology, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Microbiology and Immunology, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Microbiology and Immunology, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Microbiology and Immunology, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada langlois@uottawa.ca.']",['eng'],['89774/CIHR/Canada'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180226,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,PMC5827372,['NOTNLM'],"['*APOBEC3', '*MLV', '*SERINC3', '*SERINC5', '*glyco-Gag']",2018/01/05 06:00,2018/04/12 06:00,['2018/01/05 06:00'],"['2017/08/30 00:00 [received]', '2017/12/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/04/12 06:00 [medline]', '2018/01/05 06:00 [entrez]']","['JVI.01530-17 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.01530-17 [doi]']",epublish,J Virol. 2018 Feb 26;92(6). pii: JVI.01530-17. doi: 10.1128/JVI.01530-17.

Coupled with its differential and favorable expression profile, CD19 has rapid internalization kinetics and is not shed into the circulation, making it an ideal target for the development of antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) to treat B-cell malignancies. ADCT-402 (loncastuximab tesirine) is a novel CD19-targeted ADC delivering SG3199, a highly cytotoxic DNA minor groove interstrand crosslinking pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PDB) dimer warhead. It showed potent and highly targeted in vitro cytotoxicity in CD19-expressing human cell lines. ADCT-402 was specifically bound, internalized, and trafficked to lysosomes in CD19-expressing cells and, following release of the PBD warhead, resulted in formation of DNA crosslinks that persisted for 36 hours. Bystander killing of CD19(-) cells by ADCT-402 was also observed. In vivo, single doses of ADCT-402 resulted in highly potent, dose-dependent antitumor activity in several subcutaneous and disseminated human tumor models with marked superiority to comparator ADCs delivering tubulin inhibitors. Dose-dependent DNA crosslinks and gamma-H2AX DNA damage response were measured in tumors by 24 hours after single dose administration, whereas matched peripheral blood mononuclear cells showed no evidence of DNA damage. Pharmacokinetic analysis in rat and cynomolgus monkey showed excellent stability and tolerability of ADCT-402 in vivo. Together, these impressive data were used to support the clinical testing of this novel ADC in patients with CD19-expressing B-cell malignancies.","['Zammarchi, Francesca', 'Corbett, Simon', 'Adams, Lauren', 'Tyrer, Peter C', 'Kiakos, Konstantinos', 'Janghra, Narinder', 'Marafioti, Teresa', 'Britten, Charles E', 'Havenith, Carin E G', 'Chivers, Simon', ""D'Hooge, Francois"", 'Williams, David G', 'Tiberghien, Arnaud', 'Howard, Philip W', 'Hartley, John A', 'van Berkel, Patrick H']","['Zammarchi F', 'Corbett S', 'Adams L', 'Tyrer PC', 'Kiakos K', 'Janghra N', 'Marafioti T', 'Britten CE', 'Havenith CEG', 'Chivers S', ""D'Hooge F"", 'Williams DG', 'Tiberghien A', 'Howard PW', 'Hartley JA', 'van Berkel PH']","['ADC Therapeutics (UK) Limited, London, United Kingdom.', 'Spirogen/Medimmune Ltd, London, United Kingdom; and.', 'Cancer Research UK Drug DNA Interactions Research Group and.', 'Spirogen/Medimmune Ltd, London, United Kingdom; and.', 'Spirogen/Medimmune Ltd, London, United Kingdom; and.', 'Cancer Research UK Drug DNA Interactions Research Group and.', 'Department of Pathology, University College London Cancer Institute, London, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Pathology, University College London Cancer Institute, London, United Kingdom.', 'ADC Therapeutics (UK) Limited, London, United Kingdom.', 'ADC Therapeutics (UK) Limited, London, United Kingdom.', 'ADC Therapeutics (UK) Limited, London, United Kingdom.', 'Spirogen/Medimmune Ltd, London, United Kingdom; and.', 'Spirogen/Medimmune Ltd, London, United Kingdom; and.', 'Spirogen/Medimmune Ltd, London, United Kingdom; and.', 'Spirogen/Medimmune Ltd, London, United Kingdom; and.', 'ADC Therapeutics (UK) Limited, London, United Kingdom.', 'Spirogen/Medimmune Ltd, London, United Kingdom; and.', 'Cancer Research UK Drug DNA Interactions Research Group and.', 'ADC Therapeutics (UK) Limited, London, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],['C2559A/A16569/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180103,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,,,2018/01/05 06:00,2019/03/20 06:00,['2018/01/05 06:00'],"['2017/10/26 00:00 [received]', '2017/12/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/20 06:00 [medline]', '2018/01/05 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)32417-4 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2017-10-813493 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2018 Mar 8;131(10):1094-1105. doi: 10.1182/blood-2017-10-813493.

To our knowledge, CRS after radiation therapy (RT) for cancer has not been reported before. The development of unusual clinical signs and symptoms after RT led us to investigate the possibility of CRS after RT and review the medical literature on this topic. CASE PRESENTATION: A 65 year-old man with untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia and recurrent, metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma undergoing anti-programmed death 1 (PD1) immunotherapy was referred for palliative RT to sites of progressing metastases. Within hours of each weekly dose of RT, he experienced fever, tachycardia, hypotension, rash, dyspnea, and rigors. Based on clinical suspicion for CRS, blood cytokine measurements were performed 1 h after the second and third dose of RT and demonstrated tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels approximately ten-fold higher than normal. These were near normal immediately prior to the third dose of RT, and resolved to normal levels 3 weeks after RT. He experienced rapid regression of irradiated tumors, with development of new sites of metastases soon thereafter. A literature review revealed no clinical cases of CRS after RT for cancer. CONCLUSIONS: RT during anti-PD1 immunotherapy in a patient with underlying immune dysfunction appeared to be the putative mediator of an immune process which yielded significant increases in pro-inflammatory cytokines, and produced the clinical symptoms meeting the definition of grade 3 CRS. This case demonstrates the capability of RT to elicit immune-related adverse events.","['Barker, Christopher A', 'Kim, Samuel K', 'Budhu, Sadna', 'Matsoukas, Konstantina', 'Daniyan, Anthony F', ""D'Angelo, Sandra P""]","['Barker CA', 'Kim SK', 'Budhu S', 'Matsoukas K', 'Daniyan AF', ""D'Angelo SP""]","['Department of Radiation Oncology, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, 1275 York Avenue, New York, NY, 10065, USA. barkerc@mskcc.org.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, 1275 York Avenue, New York, NY, 10065, USA.', 'Immunology, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, USA.', 'Information Systems and Library, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, USA.']",['eng'],"['K12 CA184746/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30-CA008748/Cancer Center Support Grant/International']","['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20180103,England,J Immunother Cancer,Journal for immunotherapy of cancer,101620585,PMC5795275,['NOTNLM'],"['*Chronic lymphocytic leukemia', '*Cytokine', '*Cytokine release syndrome', '*Immunotherapy', '*Merkel cell carcinoma', '*Programmed death 1 (PD1)', '*Radiation therapy', '*Radiotherapy', '*Systemic inflammatory response syndrome', '*Tumor necrosis factor']",2018/01/05 06:00,2019/10/16 06:00,['2018/01/05 06:00'],"['2017/06/05 00:00 [received]', '2017/12/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/01/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/16 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s40425-017-0311-9 [doi]', '10.1186/s40425-017-0311-9 [pii]']",epublish,J Immunother Cancer. 2018 Jan 3;6(1):1. doi: 10.1186/s40425-017-0311-9.,20191015,1,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (PDCD1 protein, human)', '0 (Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological/therapeutic use', 'Carcinoma, Merkel Cell/blood/drug therapy/*radiotherapy', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cytokines/*blood', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/drug therapy/*radiotherapy', 'Male', 'Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Skin Neoplasms/blood/drug therapy/*radiotherapy']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Prime focus of this study was to evaluate the availability of anticancer medicines in public and private sectors, and their affordability among patients with different income levels. METHODS: A descriptive, cross-sectional survey was conducted in 22 cancer care hospitals (18 public hospitals and 04 private hospitals) and 44 private pharmacies in Punjab, Pakistan. All (n = 4400) participants were >/=18 years of age. Data were collected at different intervals and analyzed by using Statistical Packages for Social Sciences (IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 21.0. Armonk, NY: IBM Corp.) RESULTS: A total of 4913 patients were approached, and 4400 responded to the survey (response rate = 89.6%). Non-hodgkin lymphoma (12.3%), breast cancer (8.6%), and leukemia (7.6%) were the most prevailing cancers. Conventional medicines like cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, and etoposide were the most prescribed medicines. Oncologists were reluctant to prescribe newer anticancer medicines due to high prices. Originator brands (OBs) were more readily available (52.5%) but less affordable (53.4%); whereas, lowest price generics (LPGs) were less available (28.1%) but more affordable (67.9%). Anticancer medicines were more affordable by the high income class patients than the low income class patients. CONCLUSION: The availability of both OBs and LPGs was greater at private hospitals and pharmacies as compared to public hospitals. The high income class had more affordability of both OBs and LPGs; however, LPGs were more affordable for all income classes.","['Sarwar, Muhammad Rehan', 'Iftikhar, Sadia', 'Saqib, Anum']","['Sarwar MR', 'Iftikhar S', 'Saqib A']","['Department of Pharmacy, The Islamia University of Bahawalpur, Bahawalpur, Punjab, Pakistan. rehansarwaralvi@gmail.com.', 'Akhtar Saeed College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Lahore, Pakistan. rehansarwaralvi@gmail.com.', 'Akhtar Saeed College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Lahore, Pakistan.', 'Department of Pharmacy, The Islamia University of Bahawalpur, Bahawalpur, Punjab, Pakistan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20180103,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,PMC5753448,['NOTNLM'],"['*Affordability', '*Anticancer medicines', '*Availability', '*Cancer', '*Lowest price generics', '*Originator brand']",2018/01/05 06:00,2018/08/15 06:00,['2018/01/05 06:00'],"['2017/08/10 00:00 [received]', '2017/12/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/01/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/08/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12885-017-3980-3 [doi]', '10.1186/s12885-017-3980-3 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2018 Jan 3;18(1):14. doi: 10.1186/s12885-017-3980-3.,20180814,1,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*economics/*supply & distribution/therapeutic use', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hospitals, Public/*statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Income/*statistics & numerical data', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/*economics/epidemiology', 'Pakistan/epidemiology', 'Private Sector/*statistics & numerical data', 'Young Adult']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-4312-9157'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Novel combinations of imatinib with other drugs is a strategy to improve treatment efficiency. OBJECTIVE: In this study, the antileukemic and apoptotic effects of a benzamide derivative XT5 and benzoxazole derivative XT2B and their combination with imatinib were investigated in imatinib-sensitive (K562S) and imatinib-resistant (K562R) CML cells. METHODS: In vitro cytotoxicity was determined by MTT assay. Then, apoptotic effect of XT5 on CML cell lines was tested by Annexin V flow cytometry, caspase activation and RT-PCR. Docking calculation was performed using AutoDock Vina in PyMOL environment using AutoDock/Vina plugin for PyMOL. RESULTS: According to our MTT assay data, XT5 indicated significant antiproliferative effect on cell lines, therefore we investigated apoptotic effects of XT5. Treatment of K562 cell lines with a combination of XT5 and imatinib-XT5 increased cytotoxicity, the Annexin V binding and caspase 3/7 activation. In addition to apoptosis assays, we observed an increase in the expression levels of the pro-apoptotic (BAX, BAD and BIM) genes in XT5 treated K562R and K562S cells. Molecular modelling experiments showed that XT5 showed hydrogenbonding interactions with important amino acids of BCR-ABL kinase receptor; however XT2B did not show any hydrogen bond interaction. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that XT5 could be a potential candidate to be used as a new anticancer drug and XT5 combination with imatinib as an alternate treatment strategy for overcoming imatinib resistance.","['Ozkan, Tulin', 'Hekmatshoar, Yalda', 'Ertan-Bolelli, Tugba', 'Hidayat, Andry N', 'Beksac, Meral', 'Aki-Yalcin, Esin', 'Yalcin, Ismail', 'Sunguroglu, Asuman']","['Ozkan T', 'Hekmatshoar Y', 'Ertan-Bolelli T', 'Hidayat AN', 'Beksac M', 'Aki-Yalcin E', 'Yalcin I', 'Sunguroglu A']","['Department of Medical Biology, School of Medicine, Ankara University, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Department of Medical Biology, School of Medicine, Ankara University, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, Ankara University, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Biotechnology Institute, Ankara University, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Department of Hematology and Cord Blood Bank, Ankara University, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, Ankara University, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, Ankara University, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Department of Medical Biology, School of Medicine, Ankara University, Ankara, Turkey.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Netherlands,Anticancer Agents Med Chem,Anti-cancer agents in medicinal chemistry,101265649,,['NOTNLM'],"['*CML', '*K562', '*apoptosis', '*benzamide', '*imatinib resistance.']",2018/01/05 06:00,2019/07/12 06:00,['2018/01/05 06:00'],"['2017/04/25 00:00 [received]', '2017/07/12 00:00 [revised]', '2017/12/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/12 06:00 [medline]', '2018/01/05 06:00 [entrez]']","['ACAMC-EPUB-87642 [pii]', '10.2174/1871520618666171229222534 [doi]']",ppublish,Anticancer Agents Med Chem. 2018;18(11):1521-1530. doi: 10.2174/1871520618666171229222534.,20190711,11,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Benzamides/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', '*Molecular Docking Simulation', 'Molecular Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",,"['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.net.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On this basis, therapeutic drugs targeting BCL-2 and MCL-1 might have enhanced activity if used in combination. We identified anti-leukaemic drugs sensitising to BCL-2 antagonism and drugs sensitising to MCL-1 antagonism using the technique of dynamic BH3 profiling, whereby cells were primed with drugs to discover whether this would elicit mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilisation in response to BCL-2-targeting BAD-BH3 peptide or MCL-1-targeting MS1-BH3 peptide. We found that a broad range of anti-leukaemic agents-notably MCL-1 inhibitors, DNA damaging agents and FLT3 inhibitors-sensitise leukaemia cells to BAD-BH3. We further analysed the BCL-2 inhibitors ABT-199 and JQ1, the MCL-1 inhibitors pladienolide B and torin1, the FLT3 inhibitor AC220 and the DNA double-strand break inducer etoposide to correlate priming responses with co-operative induction of apoptosis. ABT-199 in combination with pladienolide B, torin1, etoposide or AC220 strongly induced apoptosis within 4 hours, but the MCL-1 inhibitors did not co-operate with etoposide or AC220. In keeping with the long half-life of BCL-2, the BET domain inhibitor JQ1 was found to downregulate BCL-2 and to prime cells to respond to MS1-BH3 at 48, but not at 4 hours: prolonged priming with JQ1 was then shown to induce rapid cytochrome C release when pladienolide B, torin1, etoposide or AC220 were added. In conclusion, dynamic BH3 profiling is a useful mechanism-based tool for understanding and predicting co-operative lethality between drugs sensitising to BCL-2 antagonism and drugs sensitising to MCL-1 antagonism. A plethora of agents sensitised cells to BAD-BH3-mediated mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilisation in the dynamic BH3 profiling assay and this was associated with effective co-operation with the BCL-2 inhibitory compounds ABT-199 or JQ1.","['Grundy, Martin', 'Seedhouse, Claire', 'Jones, Thomas', 'Elmi, Liban', 'Hall, Michael', 'Graham, Adam', 'Russell, Nigel', 'Pallis, Monica']","['Grundy M', 'Seedhouse C', 'Jones T', 'Elmi L', 'Hall M', 'Graham A', 'Russell N', 'Pallis M']","['Clinical Haematology, Nottingham University Hospitals, Nottingham, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Haematology, Division of Cancer and Stem Cells, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Haematology, Division of Cancer and Stem Cells, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Haematology, Division of Cancer and Stem Cells, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Haematology, Division of Cancer and Stem Cells, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Haematology, Division of Cancer and Stem Cells, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, United Kingdom.', 'Clinical Haematology, Nottingham University Hospitals, Nottingham, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Haematology, Division of Cancer and Stem Cells, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, United Kingdom.', 'Clinical Haematology, Nottingham University Hospitals, Nottingham, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180103,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,PMC5752038,,,2018/01/04 06:00,2018/02/16 06:00,['2018/01/04 06:00'],"['2017/08/15 00:00 [received]', '2017/12/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/01/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/16 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0190682 [doi]', 'PONE-D-17-30154 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2018 Jan 3;13(1):e0190682. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0190682. eCollection 2018.,20180215,1,"['0 ((+)-JQ1 compound)', '0 (A-1210477)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Azepines)', '0 (Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic)', '0 (Drug Combinations)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (Triazoles)', 'N54AIC43PW (venetoclax)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Azepines/pharmacology', 'Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Combinations', 'Humans', 'Indoles/pharmacology', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Sulfonamides/pharmacology', 'Triazoles/pharmacology']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-0719-2469'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The role of p53 in the cell is determined by the type of imposed oxidative stress, its intensity and duration. The last decade of research has unravelled a dual nature in the function of p53 in mediating the oxidative stress burden. However, this is dependent on the specific properties of the applied stress and thus requires further analysis. METHODS: A systematic review was performed following an electronic search of Pubmed, Google Scholar, and ScienceDirect databases. Articles published in the English language between January 1, 1990 and March 1, 2017 were identified and isolated based on the analysis of p53 in skeletal muscle in both animal and cell culture models. RESULTS: Literature was categorized according to the modality of imposed oxidative stress including exercise, diet modification, exogenous oxidizing agents, tissue manipulation, irradiation, and hypoxia. With low to moderate levels of oxidative stress, p53 is involved in activating pathways that increase time for cell repair, such as cell cycle arrest and autophagy, to enhance cell survival. However, with greater levels of stress intensity and duration, such as with irradiation, hypoxia, and oxidizing agents, the role of p53 switches to facilitate increased cellular stress levels by initiating DNA fragmentation to induce apoptosis, thereby preventing aberrant cell proliferation. CONCLUSION: Current evidence confirms that p53 acts as a threshold regulator of cellular homeostasis. Therefore, within each modality, the intensity and duration are parameters of the oxidative stressor that must be analyzed to determine the role p53 plays in regulating signaling pathways to maintain cellular health and function in skeletal muscle.

Human leucocyte antigen (HLA) and beta2 microglobulin (beta2M) serve as key molecules in tumour immunity, and their expression is reduced frequently in tumour cells. Programmed cell death (PD)-1/PD-ligand1 (PD-L1) interactions play a role in escape of tumour cells from T cell immunity. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the clinicopathological relevance of HLA and beta2M expressions in ATLL cells and PD-L1 expression in lymphoma or stromal cells and predict the overall survival of patients with ATLL. METHODS AND RESULTS: We analysed a total of 123 biopsy samples from patients newly diagnosed with ATLL by using immunohistochemical analysis. Of the patients enrolled, 91 (74%) were positive for HLA (in cell membrane, 60 patients), 89 (72%) were positive for beta2M (in cell membrane, 54 patients) and 48 (39%) were positive for both HLA and beta2M in the cell membrane (HLA(m+) beta2M(m+) ). No significant clinical differences other than prognosis were found between the HLA(m+) beta2M(m+) group and the other groups. Immunophenotypical evaluation revealed significantly higher rates of CD30-positive lymphoma cells (P = 0.003) and PD-L1-positive stromal cells in microenvironments (miPD-L1(high) ) (P = 0.011) of the HLA(m+) beta2M(m+) group than in the other groups. The HLA(m+) beta2M(m+) group had a significantly better prognosis that the other groups (P = 0.0096), and patients showing HLA(m+) beta2M(m+) with miPD-L1(high) had the most favourable prognosis among all groups. CONCLUSIONS: The membranous expression of HLA and beta2M is likely to reflect the immune response and would be useful to predict prognosis before starting ATLL therapy.","['Asano, Naoko', 'Miyoshi, Hiroaki', 'Kato, Takeharu', 'Shimono, Joji', 'Yoshida, Noriaki', 'Kurita, Daisuke', 'Sasaki, Yuya', 'Kawamoto, Keisuke', 'Ohshima, Koichi', 'Seto, Masao']","['Asano N', 'Miyoshi H', 'Kato T', 'Shimono J', 'Yoshida N', 'Kurita D', 'Sasaki Y', 'Kawamoto K', 'Ohshima K', 'Seto M']","['Department of Molecular Diagnostics, Nagano Prefectural Shinshu Medical Center, Suzaka, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Kurume University School of Medicine, Kurume, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Kurume University School of Medicine, Kurume, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Kurume University School of Medicine, Kurume, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Kurume University School of Medicine, Kurume, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Kurume University School of Medicine, Kurume, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Kurume University School of Medicine, Kurume, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Kurume University School of Medicine, Kurume, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Kurume University School of Medicine, Kurume, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Kurume University School of Medicine, Kurume, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Kurume University School of Medicine, Kurume, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20180221,England,Histopathology,Histopathology,7704136,,['NOTNLM'],"['PD-L1', 'adult T cell leukaemia/lymphoma', 'immunophenotype', 'immunosurveillance', 'survival']",2018/01/04 06:00,2018/09/07 06:00,['2018/01/04 06:00'],"['2017/08/25 00:00 [received]', '2017/12/20 00:00 [revised]', '2017/12/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/09/07 06:00 [medline]', '2018/01/04 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/his.13461 [doi]'],ppublish,Histopathology. 2018 May;72(6):945-954. doi: 10.1111/his.13461.

Consequently, modulation of DSB repair pathway renders leukemic cells resistant to therapy. As we do not fully understand the regulation of DSB repair acquired by resistant cells, targeting these cells has been a challenge. Here we investigated the regulation of DSB repair pathway in early drug resistant population (EDRP) and late drug resistant population (LDRP). We found that doxorubicin induced equal DSBs in parent and EDRP cells; however, cell death is induced only in the parent cells. Further analysis revealed that EDRP cells acquire relaxed chromatin via upregulation of lysine acetyl transferase KAT2A (GCN5). Drug treatment induces GCN5 interaction with ATM facilitating its recruitment to DSB sites. Hyperactivated ATM maximize H2AX, NBS1, BRCA1, Chk2, and Mcl-1 activation, accelerating DNA repair and survival of EDRP cells. Consequently, inhibition of GCN5 significantly reduces ATM activation and survival of EDRP cells. Contrary to EDRP, doxorubicin failed to induce DSBs in LDRP because of reduced drug uptake and downregulation of TOP2beta. Accordingly, ATM inhibition prior to doxorubicin treatment completely eliminated EDRP but not LDRP. Furthermore, baseline AML samples (n = 44) showed significantly higher GCN5 at mRNA and protein levels in MRD positive compared to MRD negative samples. Additionally, meta-analysis (n = 221) showed high GCN5 expression correlates with poor overall survival. Together, these results provide important insights into the molecular mechanism specific to EDRP and will have implications for the development of novel therapeutics for AML.","['Salunkhe, Sameer', 'Mishra, Saket V', 'Nair, Jyothi', 'Ghosh, Samadri', 'Choudhary, Neha', 'Kaur, Ekjot', 'Shah, Sanket', 'Patkar, Ketaki', 'Anand, Dev', 'Khattry, Navin', 'Hasan, Syed K', 'Dutt, Shilpee']","['Salunkhe S', 'Mishra SV', 'Nair J', 'Ghosh S', 'Choudhary N', 'Kaur E', 'Shah S', 'Patkar K', 'Anand D', 'Khattry N', 'Hasan SK', 'Dutt S']","['Shilpee Dutt laboratory, Tata Memorial Centre, Advanced Centre for Treatment, Research and Education in Cancer, Navi Mumbai, 410210, India.', 'Homi Bhabha National Institute, Training School Complex, Anushakti Nagar, Mumbai, 400085, India.', 'Shilpee Dutt laboratory, Tata Memorial Centre, Advanced Centre for Treatment, Research and Education in Cancer, Navi Mumbai, 410210, India.', 'Homi Bhabha National Institute, Training School Complex, Anushakti Nagar, Mumbai, 400085, India.', 'Shilpee Dutt laboratory, Tata Memorial Centre, Advanced Centre for Treatment, Research and Education in Cancer, Navi Mumbai, 410210, India.', 'Homi Bhabha National Institute, Training School Complex, Anushakti Nagar, Mumbai, 400085, India.', 'Shilpee Dutt laboratory, Tata Memorial Centre, Advanced Centre for Treatment, Research and Education in Cancer, Navi Mumbai, 410210, India.', 'Shilpee Dutt laboratory, Tata Memorial Centre, Advanced Centre for Treatment, Research and Education in Cancer, Navi Mumbai, 410210, India.', 'Shilpee Dutt laboratory, Tata Memorial Centre, Advanced Centre for Treatment, Research and Education in Cancer, Navi Mumbai, 410210, India.', 'Homi Bhabha National Institute, Training School Complex, Anushakti Nagar, Mumbai, 400085, India.', 'Shilpee Dutt laboratory, Tata Memorial Centre, Advanced Centre for Treatment, Research and Education in Cancer, Navi Mumbai, 410210, India.', 'Shilpee Dutt laboratory, Tata Memorial Centre, Advanced Centre for Treatment, Research and Education in Cancer, Navi Mumbai, 410210, India.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Tata Memorial Centre, Advanced Centre for Treatment, Research and Education in Cancer, Navi Mumbai, 410210, India.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Tata Memorial Centre, Advanced Centre for Treatment, Research and Education in Cancer, Navi Mumbai, 410210, India.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Tata Memorial Centre, Advanced Centre for Treatment, Research and Education in Cancer, Navi Mumbai, 410210, India.', 'Shilpee Dutt laboratory, Tata Memorial Centre, Advanced Centre for Treatment, Research and Education in Cancer, Navi Mumbai, 410210, India.', 'Homi Bhabha National Institute, Training School Complex, Anushakti Nagar, Mumbai, 400085, India.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180113,United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,,['NOTNLM'],"['*ATM', '*DNA repair', '*GCN5', '*chemoresistance', '*leukemia']",2018/01/04 06:00,2019/01/10 06:00,['2018/01/04 06:00'],"['2017/06/02 00:00 [received]', '2017/11/29 00:00 [revised]', '2017/12/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/10 06:00 [medline]', '2018/01/04 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.31242 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2018 May 15;142(10):2175-2185. doi: 10.1002/ijc.31242.

With this data increasing in a daily basis, the design and development of efficient and accurate statistical methods has become absolutely necessary. Specific analyses, such as those related to genome-wide association studies and multi-omics information, are often aimed at clustering sub-conditions of cancers and other diseases. Hierarchical clustering methods, which can be categorized into agglomerative and divisive, have been widely used in such situations. However, unlike agglomerative methods divisive clustering approaches have consistently proved to be computationally expensive. RESULTS: The proposed clustering algorithm (DRAGON) was verified on mutation and microarray data, and was gauged against standard clustering methods in the literature. Its validation included synthetic and significant biological data. When validated on mixed-lineage leukemia data, DRAGON achieved the highest clustering accuracy with data of four different dimensions. Consequently, DRAGON outperformed previous methods with 3-,4- and 5-dimensional acute leukemia data. When tested on mutation data, DRAGON achieved the best performance with 2-dimensional information. CONCLUSIONS: This work proposes a computationally efficient divisive hierarchical clustering method, which can compete equally with agglomerative approaches. The proposed method turned out to correctly cluster data with distinct topologies.

Moreover, TWIST-1 protein is a prognostic factor of leukemogenesis, and its level is raised in CML patients with cytogenetic resistance to imatinib. So, there is a likely relationship between BCR-ABL1 and TWIST-1 genes. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between TWIST-1 and BCR-ABL1 expressions. METHODS: Peripheral blood samples were obtained from 44 CML patients under treatment and also from ten healthy subjects as normal controls. The expression of TWIST-1 and BCR-ABL1 genes was measured using real-time PCR, and ABL1 was used as the reference gene. The gene expression was evaluated by REST software. RESULTS: The expression levels of TWIST-1 and BCR-ABL1 genes in CML patients was changed 40.23 +/- 177.75-fold and 6 +/- 18-fold, respectively. DISCUSSION: No significant relationship was observed between the expressions of TWIST-1 and BCR-ABL1 genes. All patients with TWIST-1 expression levels >/=100-fold had failure of response to treatment. CONCLUSION: The probability of the relationship between BCR-ABL1 and TWIST-1 is still debatable, and the average of TWIST-1 expression has been higher in patients without response to treatment. Definitive conclusion needs further investigations.","['Heidari, Nazanin', 'Vosoughi, Tina', 'Mohammadi Asl, Javad', 'Saki Malehi, Amal', 'Saki, Najmaldin']","['Heidari N', 'Vosoughi T', 'Mohammadi Asl J', 'Saki Malehi A', 'Saki N']","['a Thalassemia and Hemoglobinopathy Research Center, Research Institute of Health, Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences , Ahvaz , Iran.', 'a Thalassemia and Hemoglobinopathy Research Center, Research Institute of Health, Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences , Ahvaz , Iran.', 'b Department of Medical Genetics , School of Medicine, Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences , Ahvaz , Iran.', 'a Thalassemia and Hemoglobinopathy Research Center, Research Institute of Health, Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences , Ahvaz , Iran.', 'a Thalassemia and Hemoglobinopathy Research Center, Research Institute of Health, Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences , Ahvaz , Iran.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20180112,England,Biomarkers,"Biomarkers : biochemical indicators of exposure, response, and susceptibility to chemicals",9606000,,['NOTNLM'],"['BCR-ABL1', 'Chronic myelogenous leukaemia', 'TWIST-1']",2018/01/04 06:00,2018/01/04 06:00,['2018/01/04 06:00'],"['2018/01/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/04 06:00 [medline]', '2018/01/04 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/1354750X.2018.1423705 [doi]'],aheadofprint,Biomarkers. 2018 Jan 12:1-6. doi: 10.1080/1354750X.2018.1423705.,,,,,,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8494-5594'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unfortunately, clinical reports have shown that the treatment is associated with cardiotoxicity. Many efforts have been made to mitigate drug-mediated cardiac damage using naturally occurring antioxidant compounds possessing free radical scavenging activity. The present investigation aims to explore protective role of L-ascorbic acid (L-AA) and alpha-tocopherol (alpha-TOC) from As2O3-induced oxidative stress in H9c2 cardiomyocytes through the evaluation of Nrf2 (nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2) and Bcl-2 (B-cell lymphoma 2) transcription factors. The in vitro study was conducted using H9c2 cardiomyocytes. The evaluation of total antioxidant capacity, mitochondrial membrane potential, cellular calcium concentration and reactive oxygen species generation was performed. Oxidative stress (Nrf2) and anti-apoptotic (Bcl2) signaling indicators were measured by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. A depletion of the total antioxidant capacity and mitochondrial transmembrane potential were observed in As2O3-treated cardiomyocytes. In addition, the cellular calcium concentration and ROS generation were found to be increased on treatment with As2O3 with the alterations in the activity of transcription factors, Nrf2 and Bcl2. Co-treatment of antioxidant vitamins with As2O3 resulted in a significant reversal of oxidative stress and alteration on the antioxidant defense through the activation of Nrf2 and Bcl2. L-AA and alpha-TOC alleviates As2O3-induced oxidative stress in cardiac cells by activating Nrf2 and Bcl2 transcription factors that results in increased cell survival and prevents apoptosis.","['Vineetha, Radhakrishnan Chandraprabha', 'Binu, Prakash', 'Arathi, Pettamanna', 'Nair, Raveendran Harikumaran']","['Vineetha RC', 'Binu P', 'Arathi P', 'Nair RH']","['a School of Biosciences , Mahatma Gandhi University , Kottayam , Kerala , India.', 'a School of Biosciences , Mahatma Gandhi University , Kottayam , Kerala , India.', 'a School of Biosciences , Mahatma Gandhi University , Kottayam , Kerala , India.', 'a School of Biosciences , Mahatma Gandhi University , Kottayam , Kerala , India.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20180118,England,Toxicol Mech Methods,Toxicology mechanisms and methods,101134521,,['NOTNLM'],"['Antioxidant vitamins', 'H9c2 cells', 'arsenic trioxide', 'cardiotoxicity', 'oxidative stress']",2018/01/04 06:00,2018/09/20 06:00,['2018/01/04 06:00'],"['2018/01/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/09/20 06:00 [medline]', '2018/01/04 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/15376516.2017.1422578 [doi]'],ppublish,Toxicol Mech Methods. 2018 Jun;28(5):353-360. doi: 10.1080/15376516.2017.1422578.

With increasing alternative donors available, the preferred donor or stem cell source is debated. We set out to study outcome in recipients of alloHSCT with poor-risk AML in first complete remission (CR1) by donor type. A total of 6545 adult patients with poor-risk AML in CR1 receiving an alloHSCT using matched related donor (MRD, n = 3511) or alternative donors, including 10/10 (n = 1959) or 9/10 matched unrelated donors (MUDs, n = 549), umbilical cord blood (UCB) grafts (n = 333), or haplo-identical (haplo) donors (n = 193) were compared. Overall survival (OS) at 2 years following MRD alloHSCT was an estimated 59 +/- 1%, which did not differ from 10/10 MUD (57 +/- 1%) and haplo alloHSCT (57 +/- 4%). OS, however, was significantly lower for 9/10 MUD alloHSCT (49 +/- 2%) and UCB grafts (44 +/- 3%), respectively (P < .001). Nonrelapse mortality (NRM) depended on donor type and was estimated at 26 +/- 3% and 29 +/- 3% after haplo alloHSCT and UCB grafts at 2 years vs 15 +/- 1% following MRD alloHSCT. Multivariable analysis confirmed the impact of donor type with OS following MRD, 10/10 MUD, and haplo alloHSCT not being statistically significantly different. NRM was significantly higher for alternative donors as compared with MRD alloHSCT. Collectively, these results suggest that alloHSCT with MRDs and 10/10 MUDs may still be preferred in patients with poor-risk AML in CR1. If an MRD or 10/10 MUD is not available, then the repertoire of alternative donors includes 9/10 MUD, UCB grafts, and haplo-identical donors. The latter type of donor is increasingly applied and now approximates results with matched donors.","['Versluis, Jurjen', 'Labopin, Myriam', 'Ruggeri, Annalisa', 'Socie, Gerard', 'Wu, Depei', 'Volin, Liisa', 'Blaise, Didier', 'Milpied, Noel', 'Craddock, Charles', 'Yakoub-Agha, Ibrahim', 'Maertens, Johan', 'Ljungman, Per', 'Huynh, Anne', 'Michallet, Mauricette', 'Deconinck, Eric', 'Chevallier, Patrice', 'Passweg, Jakob', 'Ciceri, Fabio', 'Mohty, Mohamad', 'Cornelissen, Jan J', 'Nagler, Arnon']","['Versluis J', 'Labopin M', 'Ruggeri A', 'Socie G', 'Wu D', 'Volin L', 'Blaise D', 'Milpied N', 'Craddock C', 'Yakoub-Agha I', 'Maertens J', 'Ljungman P', 'Huynh A', 'Michallet M', 'Deconinck E', 'Chevallier P', 'Passweg J', 'Ciceri F', 'Mohty M', 'Cornelissen JJ', 'Nagler A']","['Department of Hematology, Erasmus University Medical Center Cancer Institute, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Sorbonne Universites, Saint-Antoine, Paris, France.', 'INSERM, Saint-Antoine, Paris, France.', 'Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Hematologie Clinique et Therapie Cellulaire, and.', 'Acute Leukemia Working Party Office, Hopital Saint-Antoine, Paris, France.', 'Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Hematologie Clinique et Therapie Cellulaire, and.', 'Eurocord.', 'INSERM, Unite mixte de recherche 1160, and.', 'Department of Hematology/Transplantation, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Department of Medicine, Helsinki University Hospital, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Department of Hematology and Transplant Program, Institut Paoli Calmettes, Marseille, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire (CHU) Bordeaux, Hopital Haut-leveque, Pessac, France.', 'Centre for Clinical Haematology, Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Birmingham, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Hematology, CHU de Lille, Lille Inflammation Research International Center INSERM U995, Universite Lille, Lille, France.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital Gasthuisberg, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Department of Hematology, Karolinksa University Hospital, Huddinge, Sweden.', 'Department of Hematology, CHU de Toulouse, Hopital Purpan, Toulouse, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Centre Hospitalier Lyon Sud, Lyon, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Hopital Jean Minjoz, Besancon, France.', 'Department of Hematology, CHU Nantes, Nantes, France.', 'Stem Cell Transplant Team, University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy; and.', 'Sorbonne Universites, Saint-Antoine, Paris, France.', 'INSERM, Saint-Antoine, Paris, France.', 'Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Hematologie Clinique et Therapie Cellulaire, and.', 'Department of Hematology, Erasmus University Medical Center Cancer Institute, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Acute Leukemia Working Party Office, Hopital Saint-Antoine, Paris, France.', 'Division of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel-Hashomer, Israel.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20170228,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,PMC5738980,,,2018/01/04 06:00,2018/01/04 06:01,['2018/01/04 06:00'],"['2016/10/21 00:00 [received]', '2017/01/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/01/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/04 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1182/bloodadvances.2016002386 [doi]', '2016/002386 [pii]']",epublish,Blood Adv. 2017 Feb 28;1(7):477-485. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2016002386. eCollection 2017 Feb 28.,,7,,,,,,"['Presented by J.V. as an oral presentation at the 56th annual meeting of the', 'American Society of Hematology, San Francisco, CA, 6-9 December 2014, and at the', '42nd annual meeting of the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,', 'Valencia, Spain, 3-6 April 2016.Conflict-of-interest disclosure: The authors', 'declare no competing financial interests.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In adults with familial GATA2-MDS, those with somatic mutations in ASXL1 experience rapid disease progression to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and poor prognosis after stem cell transplantation; however, the prevalence of somatic mutations in primary pediatric GATA2-MDS is unclear. Here, we studied a cohort of 8 pediatric patients with MDS and lacking additional GATA2-associated clinical features or significant family history and identified heterozygous germ line GATA2 mutations in 5 patients, including 1 with a normal karyotype. For those with GATA2-MDS, we screened for somatic mutations in genes with prognostic relevance in AML/MDS, using a targeted next-generation sequencing panel. Although no somatic mutations in ASXL1 were observed, somatic mutations were found in RUNX1, SETBP1, IKZF1, and CRLF2. One subject with deleterious mutations in RUNX1, SETBP1, and IKZF1 rapidly progressed to AML with disease that was refractory to treatment. Our findings confirm the importance of GATA2 testing in primary pediatric MDS, even in the absence of other clinical features of GATA2 deficiency. Further, similar to what has been observed in adults with GATA2-MDS, somatic mutations with potential prognostic effect occur in children with MDS associated with mutations in GATA2.","['Fisher, Kevin E', 'Hsu, Amy P', 'Williams, Christopher L', 'Sayeed, Hadi', 'Merritt, Brian Y', 'Elghetany, M Tarek', 'Holland, Steven M', 'Bertuch, Alison A', 'Gramatges, Maria Monica']","['Fisher KE', 'Hsu AP', 'Williams CL', 'Sayeed H', 'Merritt BY', 'Elghetany MT', 'Holland SM', 'Bertuch AA', 'Gramatges MM']","['Department of Pathology & Immunology, and.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Section of Hematology/Oncology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX; and.', 'Laboratory of Clinical Infectious Diseases, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Section of Hematology/Oncology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX; and.', 'Department of Pathology & Immunology, and.', 'Department of Pathology & Immunology, and.', 'Department of Pathology & Immunology, and.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Section of Hematology/Oncology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX; and.', 'Laboratory of Clinical Infectious Diseases, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Section of Hematology/Oncology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX; and.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Section of Hematology/Oncology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX; and.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20170227,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,PMC5738979,,,2018/01/04 06:00,2018/01/04 06:01,['2018/01/04 06:00'],"['2016/10/18 00:00 [received]', '2017/01/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/01/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/04 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1182/bloodadvances.2016002311 [doi]', '2016/002311 [pii]']",epublish,Blood Adv. 2017 Feb 27;1(7):443-448. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2016002311. eCollection 2017 Feb 28.,,7,,,,['ORCID: 0000-0002-0947-104X'],,"['Conflict-of-interest disclosure: The authors declare no competing financial', 'interests.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bioinformatic analyses of the B-allele frequency and log R ratio values from genome-wide association data have identified individuals who are mosaic for large structural abnormalities (>2 Mb). We investigated the most common autosomal event, namely mosaic del(20q), in 46 254 nonhematologic cancer cases and 36 229 cancer-free controls. We detected 91 mosaic del(20q) in leukocytes (80%) and buccal material (20%). The mosaic del(20q) mapped to a well-characterized minimally deleted region (MDR) reported in myeloid disorders. Common breakpoint clusters map to the coordinates of 29.9 to 31.5 Mb on the centromeric side of mosaic del(20q), and 42.0 to 45.4 Mb and 48.1 to 50.7 Mb on the telomeric end (GRCh36). Multivariate analyses suggest del(20q) increases with age, and is more common in males but less common in individuals of African ancestry. No conclusive associations were noted between the presence of mosaic del(20q) and subsequent solid tumor risk. Our observations demonstrate that the MDR of del(20q) is the most common large scale mosaic autosomal abnormality in whole blood and has a frequency of approximately 1 in every 1000 adults over the age of 50, which exceeds the expected incidence of myeloid leukemia in the population. Our results indicate that subclonal mosaic events of a region implicated in myeloid disorders on 20q are more frequent than the predicted population-estimated incidence of myeloid diseases, and thus suggest that these events can be tolerated until additional events accumulate that drive myeloid disorders.","['Machiela, Mitchell J', 'Zhou, Weiyin', 'Caporaso, Neil', 'Dean, Michael', 'Gapstur, Susan M', 'Goldin, Lynn', 'Rothman, Nathaniel', 'Stevens, Victoria L', 'Yeager, Meredith', 'Chanock, Stephen J']","['Machiela MJ', 'Zhou W', 'Caporaso N', 'Dean M', 'Gapstur SM', 'Goldin L', 'Rothman N', 'Stevens VL', 'Yeager M', 'Chanock SJ']","['Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Rockville, MD.', 'Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Rockville, MD.', 'Cancer Genomics Research Laboratory, Leidos Biomedical Research Inc., Frederick, MD; and.', 'Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Rockville, MD.', 'Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Rockville, MD.', 'Epidemiology Research Program, American Cancer Society, Atlanta, GA.', 'Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Rockville, MD.', 'Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Rockville, MD.', 'Epidemiology Research Program, American Cancer Society, Atlanta, GA.', 'Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Rockville, MD.', 'Cancer Genomics Research Laboratory, Leidos Biomedical Research Inc., Frederick, MD; and.', 'Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Rockville, MD.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20170213,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,PMC5738991,,,2018/01/04 06:00,2018/01/04 06:01,['2018/01/04 06:00'],"['2016/11/22 00:00 [received]', '2017/01/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/01/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/04 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1182/bloodadvances.2016003129 [doi]', '2016/003129 [pii]']",epublish,Blood Adv. 2017 Feb 13;1(6):380-385. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2016003129. eCollection 2017 Feb 14.,,6,,,,['ORCID: 0000-0001-6538-9705'],,"['Conflict-of-interest disclosure: The authors declare no competing financial', 'interests.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We hypothesized that genetic cancer predisposition disorders, such as Fanconi anemia (FA), could manifest a high rate of chromosomal mosaic events (CMEs) in peripheral blood, which could be used as early biomarkers of cancer risk. We studied the prevalence of CMEs by single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array in 130 FA patients' blood DNA and their impact on cancer risk. We detected 51 CMEs (4.4-159 Mb in size) in 16 out of 130 patients (12.3%), of which 9 had multiple CMEs. The most frequent events were gains at 3q (n = 6) and 1q (n = 5), both previously associated with leukemia, as well as rearrangements with breakpoint clustering within the major histocompatibility complex locus (P = 7.3 x 10(-9)). Compared with 15 743 age-matched population controls, FA patients had a 126 to 140 times higher risk of detectable CMEs in blood (P < 2.2 x 10(-16)). Prevalent and incident hematologic and solid cancers were more common in CME carriers (odds ratio [OR] = 11.6, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 3.4-39.3, P = 2.8 x 10(-5)), leading to poorer prognosis. The age-adjusted hazard risk (HR) of having cancer was almost 5 times higher in FA individuals with CMEs than in those without CMEs. Regarding survival, the HR of dying was 4 times higher in FA individuals having CMEs (HR = 4.0, 95% CI = 2.0-7.9, P = 5.7 x 10(-5)). Therefore, our data suggest that molecular karyotyping with SNP arrays in easy-to-obtain blood samples could be used for better monitoring of bone marrow clonal events, cancer risk, and overall survival of FA patients.","['Reina-Castillon, Judith', 'Pujol, Roser', 'Lopez-Sanchez, Marcos', 'Rodriguez-Santiago, Benjamin', 'Aza-Carmona, Miriam', 'Gonzalez, Juan Ramon', 'Casado, Jose Antonio', 'Bueren, Juan Antonio', 'Sevilla, Julian', 'Badel, Isabel', 'Catala, Albert', 'Belendez, Cristina', 'Dasi, Maria Angeles', 'Diaz de Heredia, Cristina', 'Soulier, Jean', 'Schindler, Detlev', 'Perez-Jurado, Luis Alberto', 'Surralles, Jordi']","['Reina-Castillon J', 'Pujol R', 'Lopez-Sanchez M', 'Rodriguez-Santiago B', 'Aza-Carmona M', 'Gonzalez JR', 'Casado JA', 'Bueren JA', 'Sevilla J', 'Badel I', 'Catala A', 'Belendez C', 'Dasi MA', 'Diaz de Heredia C', 'Soulier J', 'Schindler D', 'Perez-Jurado LA', 'Surralles J']","['Department of Experimental and Health Sciences, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Hospital del Mar Research Institute, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de Enfermedades Raras, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de Enfermedades Raras, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Genetics and Microbiology, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Bellaterra, Spain.', 'Department of Experimental and Health Sciences, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Hospital del Mar Research Institute, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Centre for Research in Environmental Epidemiology, ISGlobal, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Experimental and Health Sciences, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Hospital del Mar Research Institute, Barcelona, Spain.', 'qGenomics Laboratory, Esplugues de Llobregat, Spain.', 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de Enfermedades Raras, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Genetics and Microbiology, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Bellaterra, Spain.', 'Department of Experimental and Health Sciences, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Centre for Research in Environmental Epidemiology, ISGlobal, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de Epidemiologia y Salud Publica, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de Enfermedades Raras, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Division of Hematopoietic Innovative Therapies, Centro de Investigaciones Energeticas, Medioambientales y Tecnologicas, Madrid, Spain.', 'Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria Fundacion Jimenez Diaz, Madrid, Spain.', 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de Enfermedades Raras, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Division of Hematopoietic Innovative Therapies, Centro de Investigaciones Energeticas, Medioambientales y Tecnologicas, Madrid, Spain.', 'Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria Fundacion Jimenez Diaz, Madrid, Spain.', 'Hematology Service, Hospital Nino Jesus, Madrid, Spain.', 'Pediatrics Service, Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Hematology Service, Hospital Sant Joan de Deu, Esplugues de Llobregat, Spain.', 'Oncohematology Service, Hospital Gregorio Maranon, Madrid, Spain.', 'Hematology Service, Hospital Universitario la Fe, Valencia, Spain.', ""Hemato-Oncology Service, Hospital Maternoinfantil Vall d'Hebron, Barcelona, Spain."", 'Institute of Hematology, Universite Paris-Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France.', 'INSERM, Unite Mixte de Recherche 944, and.', 'Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Unite Mixte de Recherche 7212, Saint-Louis Hospital, Paris, France.', 'Department of Human Genetics, University of Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany; and.', 'Department of Experimental and Health Sciences, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Hospital del Mar Research Institute, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de Enfermedades Raras, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de Enfermedades Raras, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Genetics and Microbiology, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Bellaterra, Spain.', 'Genetics Department, Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau, Barcelona, Spain.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20170123,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,PMC5744036,,,2018/01/04 06:00,2018/01/04 06:01,['2018/01/04 06:00'],"['2016/08/29 00:00 [received]', '2016/12/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/01/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/04 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1182/bloodadvances.2016000943 [doi]', '2016/000943 [pii]']",epublish,Blood Adv. 2017 Jan 23;1(5):319-329. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2016000943. eCollection 2017 Jan 24.,,5,,,,,,"['Conflict-of-interest disclosure: B.R.-S. is an employee of, and L.A.P.-J. is a', 'scientific advisor for, qGenomics, SL.

To identify AML-associated genes prognostic of AML relapse post-allo-SCT, we resequenced 35 genes in 113 adults at diagnosis, 49 of whom relapsed. Two hundred sixty-two mutations were detected in 102/113 (90%) patients. An increased risk of relapse was observed in patients with mutations in WT1 (P = .018), DNMT3A (P = .045), FLT3 ITD (P = .071), and TP53 (P = .06), whereas mutations in IDH1 were associated with a reduced risk of disease relapse (P = .018). In 29 patients, we additionally compared mutational profiles in bone marrow at diagnosis and relapse to study changes in clonal structure at relapse. In 13/29 patients, mutational profiles altered at relapse. In 9 patients, mutations present at relapse were not detected at diagnosis. In 15 patients, additional available pre-allo-SCT samples demonstrated that mutations identified posttransplant but not at diagnosis were detectable immediately prior to transplant in 2 of 15 patients.

Some CP-CML patients acquire additional mutation(s) that transforms CP-CML to poor prognosis, hard to treat, acute myeloid or lymphoid leukemia or blast phase CML (BP-CML). It is unclear where in the hemopoietic hierarchy additional mutations are acquired in BP-CML, how the hemopoietic hierarchy is altered as a consequence, and the cellular identity of the resulting leukemia-propagating stem cell (LSC) populations. Here, we show that myeloid BP-CML is associated with expanded populations that have the immunophenotype of normal progenitor populations that vary between patients. Serial transplantation in immunodeficient mice demonstrated functional LSCs reside in multiple populations with the immunophenotype of normal progenitor as well as stem cells. Multicolor fluorescence in situ hybridization detected serial acquisition of cytogenetic abnormalities of chromosome 17, associated with transformation to BP-CML, that is detected with equal frequency in all functional LSC compartments.

Humans are a Forssman antigen-negative species; however, rare individuals with Apae phenotype express FORS1 on their red blood cells. We previously demonstrated that the replacement of the LeuGlyGly tripeptide sequence at codons 266 to 268 of human AT with GBGT1-encoded FS-specific GlyGlyAla enabled the enzyme to produce FORS1 antigen, although the FS activity was weak. We searched for additional molecular mechanisms that might allow human AT to express FORS1. A variety of derivative expression constructs of human AT were prepared. DNA was transfected into COS1 (B3GALNT1) cells, and cell-surface expression of FORS1 was immunologically monitored. To our surprise, the deletion of exon 3 or 4, but not of exon 2 or 5, of human AT transcripts bestowed moderate FS activity, indicating that the A allele is inherently capable of producing a protein with FS activity. Because RNA splicing is frequently altered in cancer, this mechanism may explain, at least partially, the appearance of FORS1 in human cancer. Furthermore, strong FS activity was attained, in addition to AT and BT activities, by cointroducing 1 of those deletions and the GlyGlyAla substitution, possibly by the synergistic effects of altered intra-Golgi localization/conformation by the former and modified enzyme specificity by the latter.","['Yamamoto, Miyako', 'Cid, Emili', 'Yamamoto, Fumiichiro']","['Yamamoto M', 'Cid E', 'Yamamoto F']","['Laboratory of Immunohematology and Glycobiology, Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute, Campus Can Ruti, Barcelona, Spain; and.', 'Laboratory of Immunohematology and Glycobiology, Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute, Campus Can Ruti, Barcelona, Spain; and.', 'Laboratory of Immunohematology and Glycobiology, Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute, Campus Can Ruti, Barcelona, Spain; and.', ""Programa de Medicina Predictiva i Personalitzada del Cancer, Institut d'Investigacio Germans Trias i Pujol, Campus Can Ruti, Barcelona, Spain.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20171220,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,PMC5745132,,,2018/01/04 06:00,2018/01/04 06:01,['2018/01/04 06:00'],"['2017/06/26 00:00 [received]', '2017/11/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/01/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/04 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1182/bloodadvances.2017009795 [doi]', '2017/009795 [pii]']",epublish,Blood Adv. 2017 Dec 20;1(27):2756-2766. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2017009795. eCollection 2017 Dec 26.,,27,,,,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-9516-1402', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5025-352X', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9690-7034']",,"['Conflict-of-interest disclosure: The authors declare no competing financial', 'interests.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Given the recent descriptions of clonal hematopoiesis in aged populations, the increased risk of developing hematologic malignancies in individuals with clonal hematopoiesis, and the many similarities in hematopoietic aging and acquired bone marrow failure (BMF) syndromes, such as myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), this raises significant questions regarding the relationship between aging hematopoiesis and MDS, including the factors that regulate HSC aging, whether clonal hematopoiesis is required for the development of MDS, and even whether BMF is an inevitable consequence of aging.

Here, we investigated the risk of BP based on additional chromosomal abnormality (ACA) profiles in a cohort of 2326 CML patients treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). We examined the time intervals from initial diagnosis to ACA emergence (interval 1), from ACA emergence to onset of BP (interval 2), and survival after onset of BP (interval 3). Based on BP risk associated with each ACA, patients were stratified into intermediate-1, intermediate-2, and HR groups, with a median duration of interval 2 of unreached, 19.2 months, and 1.9 months, respectively. There was no difference in durations of intervals 1 or 3 among 3 groups. Including patients without ACAs who formed the standard-risk group, the overall 5-year cumulative probability of BP was 9.8%, 28.0%, 41.7%, and 67.4% for these 4 groups, respectively. The pre-BP disease course in those who developed BP was similar regardless of cytogenetic alterations, and 84.4% of BP patients developed BP within the first 5 years of diagnosis. In summary, interval 2 is the predominant determinant of BP risk and patient outcome. By prolonging the duration of interval 2, TKI therapy mitigates BP risk associated with low-risk ACAs or no ACAs but does not alter the natural course of CML with HR ACAs. Thus, we have identified a group of patients who have HR of BP and may benefit from timely alternative treatment to prevent onset of BP.","['Gong, Zimu', 'Medeiros, L Jeffrey', 'Cortes, Jorge E', 'Chen, Zi', 'Zheng, Lan', 'Li, Yan', 'Bai, Shi', 'Lin, Pei', 'Miranda, Roberto N', 'Jorgensen, Jeffrey L', 'McDonnell, Timothy J', 'Wang, Wei', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M', 'Hu, Shimin']","['Gong Z', 'Medeiros LJ', 'Cortes JE', 'Chen Z', 'Zheng L', 'Li Y', 'Bai S', 'Lin P', 'Miranda RN', 'Jorgensen JL', 'McDonnell TJ', 'Wang W', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Hu S']","['Department of Hematopathology and.', 'Department of Hematopathology and.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Hematopathology and.', 'Department of Hematopathology and.', 'Department of Hematopathology and.', 'Department of Hematopathology and.', 'Department of Hematopathology and.', 'Department of Hematopathology and.', 'Department of Hematopathology and.', 'Department of Hematopathology and.', 'Department of Hematopathology and.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Hematopathology and.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20171208,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,PMC5728641,,,2018/01/04 06:00,2018/01/04 06:01,['2018/01/04 06:00'],"['2017/08/22 00:00 [received]', '2017/10/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/01/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/04 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1182/bloodadvances.2017011858 [doi]', '2017/011858 [pii]']",epublish,Blood Adv. 2017 Dec 8;1(26):2541-2552. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2017011858. eCollection 2017 Dec 12.,,26,,,,['ORCID: 0000-0001-7110-3814'],,"['Conflict-of-interest disclosure: The authors declare no competing financial', 'interests.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We conducted a single-center retrospective study of 78 consecutive adults who had sIL-2r measured for suspected HLH. Serum sIL-2r levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (adult reference range, 241-846 U/mL). There were 38 patients with HLH and 40 with a non-HLH diagnosis (such as sepsis, liver disease, histiocyte disorders, autoimmune disease, leukemia, or lymphoma). The receiver operating characteristic curve demonstrated that sIL-2r is a good to excellent diagnostic test for adult HLH, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.90 (95% confidence interval, 0.83-0.97) compared with AUC 0.78 (95% confidence interval, 0.67-0.88) for ferritin. The optimal threshold for sIL-2r was 2515 U/mL (sensitivity, 100%; specificity, 72.5%). Although there was a large indeterminate range for sIL-2r, a level of 2400 U/mL or less was helpful for ruling out HLH (sensitivity, 100%), and more than 10 000 U/mL was helpful for ruling in HLH (specificity, 93%). Higher mean sIL-2r levels were seen in malignancy-associated HLH (20 241 U/mL) compared with infection-associated HLH and macrophage activation syndrome (9720 and 5008 U/mL, respectively; P < .05). Levels above 10 000 U/mL were not associated with worse prognosis in patients with HLH.

This review examines some basics of telomere biology and relates how telomere function, telomerase activity, and mutations in TERC or TERT are involved in bone marrow failure, leukemias, and other cancers. Given the challenge to obtain accurate data on telomerase activity and telomere length in specific cell types, the situation in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remains puzzling. In most cancers, telomerase levels are increased after cells have encountered a ""telomere crisis,"" which is typically associated with poor prognosis. Cells emerging from ""telomere crisis"" have defective DNA damage responses, resulting, for example, from loss of p53. Such cells often express elevated telomerase levels as a result of point mutations in the TERT promoter or amplification of the TERT gene. While telomeres in AML blasts are typically shorter than expected for normal leukocytes, most AML cells do not show evidence of having gone through a ""telomere crisis."" In chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), the difference between the telomere length in nonmalignant T cells and malignant blasts from the same patient was found to correlate with the remaining duration of the chronic phase. This observation supports that a mitotic clock is ticking in CML stem cells and that disease progression in CML heralds the onset of a ""telomere crisis."" The presence of very short telomeres in tumor cells was found to predict disease progression in chronic lymphocytic leukemia, myeloma, and various solid tumors.

It can be detected by molecular methods that use leukemia-specific or patient-specific molecular markers (fusion gene transcripts, or immunoglobulin/T-cell receptor [IG/TR] gene rearrangements), and by multi-parametric flow cytometry. The sensitivity and specificity of these methods can vary across treatment time points and therapeutic settings. Thus, knowledge of the principles and limitations of each technology is of the utmost importance for correct interpretation of MRD results. Time will tell whether new molecular and flow cytometric high-throughput technologies can overcome the limitations of current standard methods and eventually bring additional benefits. MRD during standard ALL chemotherapy is the strongest overall prognostic indicator and has therefore been used for refining initial treatment stratification. Moreover, MRD positivity after the maintenance phase of treatment may point to an impending relapse and thus enable salvage treatment to be initiated earlier, which could possibly improve treatment results. The prognostic relevance of pretransplantation MRD was shown by several studies, and MRD high-risk patients were shown to benefit from stem cell transplantation (SCT). Also, MRD positivity after SCT correlates with worse outcomes. In addition, MRD information is very instructive in current clinical trials that test novel agents to evaluate their treatment efficacy. Although conventional clinical risk factors lose their independent prognostic significance when combined with MRD information, recently identified genetic markers may further improve the treatment stratification in ALL.","['Bruggemann, Monika', 'Kotrova, Michaela']","['Bruggemann M', 'Kotrova M']","['Department of Hematology, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Campus Kiel, Kiel, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Campus Kiel, Kiel, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20171128,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,PMC5729622,,,2018/01/04 06:00,2018/01/04 06:01,['2018/01/04 06:00'],"['2017/07/17 00:00 [received]', '2017/08/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/01/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/04 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1182/bloodadvances.2017009845 [doi]', '2017/009845 [pii]']",epublish,Blood Adv. 2017 Nov 28;1(25):2456-2466. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2017009845. eCollection 2017 Nov 28.,,25,,,,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-5514-5010', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5394-1072']",,"['Conflict-of-interest disclosure: M.B. received honoraria from Amgen, Inc. and', 'Roche Pharma AG; received financial support for reference diagnostics from Amgen,', 'Inc., Affimed, and Regeneron; was a member of the Speakers Bureau for Amgen,', 'Inc., and Pfizer Oncology; received research funding from Amgen, Inc.; and served', 'as a consultant for Incyte.

We studied the prognostic value of early POD in a cohort of patients with CLL enrolled between 2010 and 2014 in the Connect CLL Registry. Overall, 829 eligible patients receiving first-line therapy were categorized into 3 groups: early POD (progression <2 years after treatment initiation), late POD (progression >/=2 years after treatment initiation), and no POD as of 1 May 2017. Baseline demographics, treatment characteristics, and overall survival (OS) were analyzed. Logistic regression models identified independent predictors of early POD; Cox regression models were used to evaluate the risk of early POD. With a median follow-up of 48.8 months, 209 (25.2%), 162 (19.5%), and 458 (55.3%) patients had early, late, and no POD, respectively. Patients with early POD were older and had inferior response to similar first-line treatment regimens vs late and no POD groups (overall response rate: 53% vs 80% vs 84%). Patients with early POD were more likely to have unfavorable-risk cytogenetics (del[11q]/del[17p]) than patients with no POD (34% vs 20%; P = .04). Early POD was associated with an inferior OS across all patients (hazard ratio, 3.6; 95% confidence interval, 2.6-5.1; P < .01) and in patients treated with fludarabine, cyclophosphamide plus rituximab, and bendamustine plus rituximab (P < .05). Early POD within 2 years of first-line therapy is a robust clinical prognostic factor for inferior OS in patients with CLL.

Recent genome-wide studies have uncovered frequent genetic alterations involving RAS pathway mutations and loss of the INK4A/ARF locus, suggesting their important role in the pathogenesis, relapse, and chemotherapy resistance of B-ALL. To better understand the oncogenic mechanisms by which these alterations might promote B-ALL and to develop an in vivo preclinical model of relapsed B-ALL, we engineered mouse strains with induced somatic Kras(G12D) pathway activation and/or loss of Ink4a/Arf during early stages of B-cell development. Although constitutive activation of Kras(G12D) in B cells induced prominent transcriptional changes that resulted in enhanced proliferation, it was not sufficient by itself to induce development of a high-grade leukemia/lymphoma. Instead, in 40% of mice, these engineered mutations promoted development of a clonal low-grade lymphoproliferative disorder resembling human extranodal marginal-zone lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue or lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma. Interestingly, loss of the Ink4a/Arf locus, apart from reducing the number of apoptotic B cells broadly attenuated Kras(G12D)-induced transcriptional signatures. However, combined Kras activation and Ink4a/Arf inactivation cooperated functionally to induce a fully penetrant, highly aggressive B-ALL phenotype resembling high-risk subtypes of human B-ALL such as BCR-ABL and CRFL2-rearranged. Ninety percent of examined murine B-ALL tumors showed loss of the wild-type Ink4a/Arf locus without acquisition of highly recurrent cooperating events, underscoring the role of Ink4a/Arf in restraining Kras-driven oncogenesis in the lymphoid compartment. These data highlight the importance of functional cooperation between mutated Kras and Ink4a/Arf loss on B-ALL.","['Sewastianik, Tomasz', 'Jiang, Meng', 'Sukhdeo, Kumar', 'Patel, Sanjay S', 'Roberts, Kathryn', 'Kang, Yue', 'Alduaij, Ahmad', 'Dennis, Peter S', 'Lawney, Brian', 'Liu, Ruiyang', 'Song, Zeyuan', 'Xiong, Jessie', 'Zhang, Yunyu', 'Lemieux, Madeleine E', 'Pinkus, Geraldine S', 'Rich, Jeremy N', 'Weinstock, David M', 'Mullighan, Charles G', 'Sharpless, Norman E', 'Carrasco, Ruben D']","['Sewastianik T', 'Jiang M', 'Sukhdeo K', 'Patel SS', 'Roberts K', 'Kang Y', 'Alduaij A', 'Dennis PS', 'Lawney B', 'Liu R', 'Song Z', 'Xiong J', 'Zhang Y', 'Lemieux ME', 'Pinkus GS', 'Rich JN', 'Weinstock DM', 'Mullighan CG', 'Sharpless NE', 'Carrasco RD']","['Department of Oncologic Pathology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', 'Department of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Transfusion Medicine, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Oncologic Pathology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', 'Department of Surgical Oncology, The Fourth Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.', 'Department of Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH.', 'Department of Pathology, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH.', ""Department of Pathology, Brigham & Women's Hospital, Boston, MA."", ""Department of Pathology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", 'Department of Oncologic Pathology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', 'Pathology and Laboratory Medicine Institute, Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.', 'Department of Oncologic Pathology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', 'Center for Computational Cancer Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', 'Department of Oncologic Pathology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', 'Department of Oncologic Pathology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', 'Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, School of Medicine, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA; and.', 'Bioinfo, Plantagenet, ON, Canada.', ""Department of Pathology, Brigham & Women's Hospital, Boston, MA."", 'Department of Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA; and.', ""Department of Pathology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", 'Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, School of Medicine, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC.', 'Department of Oncologic Pathology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', ""Department of Pathology, Brigham & Women's Hospital, Boston, MA.""]",['eng'],"['F30 CA165857/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA151391/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA196783/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM007250/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",['Journal Article'],20171121,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,PMC5729631,,,2018/01/04 06:00,2018/01/04 06:01,['2018/01/04 06:00'],"['2017/09/07 00:00 [received]', '2017/09/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/01/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/04 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1182/bloodadvances.2017012211 [doi]', '2017/012211 [pii]']",epublish,Blood Adv. 2017 Nov 21;1(25):2361-2374. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2017012211. eCollection 2017 Nov 28.,,25,,,,,,"['Conflict-of-interest disclosure: The authors declare no competing financial', 'interests.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We devised a novel approach based on chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-redirected T lymphocytes. We selected CD7 as a target because of its consistent expression in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), including the most aggressive subtype, early T-cell precursor (ETP)-ALL. In 49 diagnostic T-ALL samples (including 14 ETP-ALL samples), median CD7 expression was >99%; CD7 expression remained high at relapse (n = 14), and during chemotherapy (n = 54). We targeted CD7 with a second-generation CAR (anti-CD7-41BB-CD3zeta), but CAR expression in T lymphocytes caused fratricide due to the presence of CD7 in the T cells themselves. To downregulate CD7 and control fratricide, we applied a new method (protein expression blocker [PEBL]), based on an anti-CD7 single-chain variable fragment coupled with an intracellular retention domain. Transduction of anti-CD7 PEBL resulted in virtually instantaneous abrogation of surface CD7 expression in all transduced T cells; 2.0% +/- 1.7% were CD7(+) vs 98.1% +/- 1.5% of mock-transduced T cells (n = 5; P < .0001). PEBL expression did not impair T-cell proliferation, interferon-gamma and tumor necrosis factor-alpha secretion, or cytotoxicity, and eliminated CAR-mediated fratricide. PEBL-CAR T cells were highly cytotoxic against CD7(+) leukemic cells in vitro and were consistently more potent than CD7(+) T cells spared by fratricide. They also showed strong anti-leukemic activity in cell line- and patient-derived T-ALL xenografts. The strategy described in this study fits well with existing clinical-grade cell manufacturing processes and can be rapidly implemented for the treatment of patients with high-risk T-cell malignancies.","['Png, Yi Tian', 'Vinanica, Natasha', 'Kamiya, Takahiro', 'Shimasaki, Noriko', 'Coustan-Smith, Elaine', 'Campana, Dario']","['Png YT', 'Vinanica N', 'Kamiya T', 'Shimasaki N', 'Coustan-Smith E', 'Campana D']","['Department of Pediatrics, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20171121,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,PMC5729624,,,2018/01/04 06:00,2018/01/04 06:01,['2018/01/04 06:00'],"['2017/06/27 00:00 [received]', '2017/10/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/01/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/04 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1182/bloodadvances.2017009928 [doi]', '2017/009928 [pii]']",epublish,Blood Adv. 2017 Nov 21;1(25):2348-2360. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2017009928. eCollection 2017 Nov 28.,,25,,,,['ORCID: 0000-0002-8180-2202'],,"['Conflict-of-interest disclosure: Y.T.P., N.V., T.K., E.C.-S., and D.C. are', 'coinventors on patent applications describing some of the technologies used in', 'this study.

Little is known about the value patients place upon the attributes of available CLL treatments, which vary in efficacy, side effects, and mode of administration. We used a discrete-choice experiment (DCE) to investigate patients' preferences for treatment attributes and the impact of out-of-pocket cost on patients' choices. DCE surveys pose a series of choices between hypothetical treatment options, each defined by a set of attributes, and the responses provide quantitative estimates of the average relative preferences for treatment attribute. Each hypothetical treatment in this survey was defined by 5 attributes with predefined levels for efficacy, adverse events, and mode administration. A patient advocacy organization recruited 384 patients with a self-reported physician diagnosis of CLL to complete the online survey. Respondents placed the highest relative importance on longer progression-free survival (PFS). However, the risk of adverse events also was important, as significant additional PFS was needed to offset patients' acceptance of worsening adverse events. A supplemental question with 2 treatments and varying costs was included to assess the impact of cost on choice. When costs were included, a large proportion of patients changed their choices between the 2 treatments. Given the available treatments and the high cost of some treatments, physicians may want to explore their patients' preferences for different treatment features, including benefit-risk tradeoffs and out-of-pocket cost, when selecting the best treatment strategies for patients.","['Mansfield, Carol', 'Masaquel, Anthony', 'Sutphin, Jessie', 'Weiss, Elisa', 'Gutierrez, Meghan', 'Wilson, Jennifer', 'Boeri, Marco', 'Li, Jia', 'Reyes, Carolina']","['Mansfield C', 'Masaquel A', 'Sutphin J', 'Weiss E', 'Gutierrez M', 'Wilson J', 'Boeri M', 'Li J', 'Reyes C']","['RTI Health Solutions, Research Triangle Park, NC.', 'Genentech Inc., South San Francisco, CA.', 'RTI Health Solutions, Research Triangle Park, NC.', 'The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, Rye Brook, NY; and.', 'Lymphoma Research Foundation, New York, NY.', 'The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, Rye Brook, NY; and.', 'RTI Health Solutions, Research Triangle Park, NC.', 'Genentech Inc., South San Francisco, CA.', 'Genentech Inc., South San Francisco, CA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20171031,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,PMC5737119,,,2018/01/04 06:00,2018/01/04 06:01,['2018/01/04 06:00'],"['2017/03/30 00:00 [received]', '2017/09/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/01/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/04 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1182/bloodadvances.2017007294 [doi]', '2017/007294 [pii]']",epublish,Blood Adv. 2017 Oct 31;1(24):2176-2185. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2017007294. eCollection 2017 Nov 14.,,24,,,,,,"['Conflict-of-interest disclosure: C.M., M.B., and J.S. are full-time employees of', 'RTI Health Solutions and were paid contractors of Genentech, Inc., in the', 'development of the survey, the analysis and interpretation of the data, and', 'preparation of the study report.

MAPK mutations occur in hematologic cancers as well, but their role is less clear and few models are available to study this. We developed an in vivo model of disseminated BRAF(V600E) B-cell leukemia to determine the effects of this mutation on tumor development and immune evasion. Mice with B-cell-restricted BRAF(V600E) expression crossed with the Emicro-TCL1 model of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) developed leukemia significantly earlier (median, 4.9 vs 8.1 months; P < .001) and had significantly shorter lifespan (median, 7.3 vs 12.1 months; P < .001) versus BRAF wild-type counterparts. BRAF(V600E) expression did not affect B-cell proliferation but reduced spontaneous apoptosis. BRAF(V600E)-mutant leukemia produced greater T-cell effects, evidenced by exhaustion immunophenotype and CD44(+) T-cell percentage, as well as increased expression of PD-L1 on CD11b(+) cells. Results were confirmed in syngeneic mice engrafted with BRAF(V600E) leukemia cells. Furthermore, a BRAF(V600E)-expressing CLL cell line more strongly inhibited anti-CD3/CD28-induced T-cell proliferation, which was reversed by BRAF(V600E) inhibition. These results demonstrate the immune-suppressive impact of BRAF(V600E) in B-cell leukemias and introduce a new model to develop rational combination strategies targeting both tumor cells and tumor-mediated immune evasion.","['Tsai, Yo-Ting', 'Lakshmanan, Aparna', 'Lehman, Amy', 'Harrington, Bonnie K', 'Lucas, Fabienne McClanahan', 'Tran, Minh', 'Sass, Ellen J', 'Long, Meixiao', 'Flechtner, Alan D', 'Jaynes, Florinda', 'La Perle, Krista', 'Coppola, Vincenzo', 'Lozanski, Gerard', 'Muthusamy, Natarajan', 'Byrd, John C', 'Grever, Michael R', 'Lucas, David M']","['Tsai YT', 'Lakshmanan A', 'Lehman A', 'Harrington BK', 'Lucas FM', 'Tran M', 'Sass EJ', 'Long M', 'Flechtner AD', 'Jaynes F', 'La Perle K', 'Coppola V', 'Lozanski G', 'Muthusamy N', 'Byrd JC', 'Grever MR', 'Lucas DM']","['Comprehensive Cancer Center.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center.', 'Center for Biostatistics.', 'College of Veterinary Medicine, and.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center.', 'College of Veterinary Medicine, and.', 'College of Veterinary Medicine, and.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center.', 'College of Veterinary Medicine, and.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center.', 'Department of Pathology, College of Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus OH.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center.', 'College of Veterinary Medicine, and.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center.', 'College of Veterinary Medicine, and.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center.']",['eng'],"['P30 CA016058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA140158/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA177292/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R35 CA197734/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['Journal Article'],20171030,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,PMC5737117,,,2018/01/04 06:00,2018/01/04 06:01,['2018/01/04 06:00'],"['2017/03/14 00:00 [received]', '2017/09/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/01/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/04 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1182/bloodadvances.2017006593 [doi]', '2017/006593 [pii]']",epublish,Blood Adv. 2017 Oct 30;1(24):2147-2160. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2017006593. eCollection 2017 Nov 14.,,24,,,,,,"['Conflict-of-interest disclosure: The authors declare no competing financial', 'interests.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we found that Toll-like receptor 1 (TLR1) and TLR2 are upregulated on primary AML CD34(+)CD38(-) cells relative to corresponding normal bone marrow cells. Activating the TLR1/TLR2 complex by the agonist Pam3CSK4 in MLL-AF9-driven human AML resulted in induction of apoptosis by p38 MAPK-dependent activation of Caspase 3 and myeloid differentiation in a NFkappaB-dependent manner. By using murine Trp53(-/-)MLL-AF9 AML cells, we demonstrate that p53 is dispensable for Pam3CSK4-induced apoptosis and differentiation. Moreover, murine AML1-ETO9a-driven AML cells also were forced into apoptosis and differentiation on TLR1/TLR2 activation, demonstrating that the antileukemic effects observed were not confined to MLL-rearranged AML. We further evaluated whether Pam3CSK4 would exhibit selective antileukemic effects. Ex vivo Pam3CSK4 treatment inhibited murine and human leukemia-initiating cells, whereas murine normal hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) were relatively less affected. Consistent with these findings, primary human AML cells across several genetic subtypes of AML were more vulnerable for TLR1/TLR2 activation relative to normal human HSPCs. In the MLL-AF9 AML mouse model, treatment with Pam3CSK4 provided proof of concept for in vivo therapeutic efficacy. Our results demonstrate that TLR1 and TLR2 are upregulated on primitive AML cells and that agonistic targeting of TLR1/TLR2 forces AML cells into apoptosis by p38 MAPK-dependent activation of Caspase 3, and differentiation by activating NFkappaB, thus revealing a new putative strategy for therapeutically targeting AML cells.","['Eriksson, Mia', 'Pena-Martinez, Pablo', 'Ramakrishnan, Ramprasad', 'Chapellier, Marion', 'Hogberg, Carl', 'Glowacki, Gabriella', 'Orsmark-Pietras, Christina', 'Velasco-Hernandez, Talia', 'Lazarevic, Vladimir Lj', 'Juliusson, Gunnar', 'Cammenga, Jorg', 'Mulloy, James C', 'Richter, Johan', 'Fioretos, Thoas', 'Ebert, Benjamin L', 'Jaras, Marcus']","['Eriksson M', 'Pena-Martinez P', 'Ramakrishnan R', 'Chapellier M', 'Hogberg C', 'Glowacki G', 'Orsmark-Pietras C', 'Velasco-Hernandez T', 'Lazarevic VL', 'Juliusson G', 'Cammenga J', 'Mulloy JC', 'Richter J', 'Fioretos T', 'Ebert BL', 'Jaras M']","['Department of Clinical Genetics and.', 'Department of Clinical Genetics and.', 'Department of Clinical Genetics and.', 'Department of Clinical Genetics and.', 'Department of Clinical Genetics and.', 'Department of Clinical Genetics and.', 'Department of Clinical Genetics and.', 'Department of Molecular Hematology, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Radiation Physics, Skane University Hospital, Lund, Sweden.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Radiation Physics, Skane University Hospital, Lund, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Linkoping University, Linkoping, Sweden.', ""Division of Experimental Hematology and Cancer Biology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH; and."", 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Radiation Physics, Skane University Hospital, Lund, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical Genetics and.', ""Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA."", 'Department of Clinical Genetics and.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20171018,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,PMC5728277,,,2018/01/04 06:00,2018/01/04 06:01,['2018/01/04 06:00'],"['2017/02/22 00:00 [received]', '2017/09/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/01/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/04 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1182/bloodadvances.2017006148 [doi]', '2017/006148 [pii]']",epublish,Blood Adv. 2017 Oct 18;1(23):2046-2057. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2017006148. eCollection 2017 Oct 24.,,23,,,,,,"['Conflict-of-interest disclosure: The authors declare no competing financial', 'interests.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One patient received no cancer-directed therapy. Of the remaining 15 patients, all received conventional chemotherapy, and 9 (60%) underwent transplant. Thirteen patients (87%) received immunomodulating therapy (predominantly rituximab). The median time from cancer diagnosis to PML diagnosis was 48.5 months. PML was diagnosed a median of 2.1 months from symptom onset; however, the median time to PML diagnosis was 5.4 months for the 4 patients presenting with a cerebellar syndrome.

Clonal hematopoiesis in people without an MDS diagnosis carries an increased risk of cardiovascular death. Many clonally restricted mutations are shared between patients with MDS and those with non-MDS clonal hematopoiesis; therefore, we evaluated the risk of cardiovascular death among patients with MDS. We evaluated adults with MDS in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database of the National Cancer Institute and compared them with the general population living in the same states. We grouped histological subtypes of MDS into lower-, intermediate-, and higher-risk disease. The primary outcomes were overall survival and primary cause of death (COD) as reported to state registries. A total of 21 372 patients with MDS between 2001 and 2011 died during follow-up with a known COD. The rate of death due to cardiovascular disease (CVD) was 4613 per 100 000 person-years, compared with 2091 in the age- and-sex-adjusted US population (standardized mortality ratio, 2.21). At 24 months, the cumulative incidence of death attributed to MDS or leukemia was 23% vs 8% for CVD. Among those alive at 60 months, 27% eventually died of CVD compared with 29% from MDS or leukemia; those with lower-risk disease who survived >60 months had more deaths attributed to cardiovascular causes (30%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 26.7-33.2%) than MDS itself (24%; 95% CI, 21.4-27.5%). Patients with MDS are more likely to die of cardiovascular causes than the general population.

In patients without an HLA-matched sibling donor, a family haploidentical donor is an alternative option. The present study reports the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation activity for haploidentical transplantation in MDS patients. A total of 228 patients transplanted from a mismatched HLA-related donor between 2007 and 2014 were studied. The median age at transplant was 56 years. Eighty-four (37%) patients had MDS transformed into acute myeloid leukemia at the time of transplant. Ex vivo T-cell depletion was used in 34 patients. One hundred ninety-four patients received a T-cell replete transplant and 102 patients received posttransplant cyclophosphamide (PT-CY) as graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis. The cumulative incidences of acute and chronic GVHD in PT-CY vs other patients were 25% vs 37% and 37% vs 24%, respectively. The cumulative incidence of nonrelapse mortality was 55% in patients who did not receive PT-CY (no PT-CY) and 41% in patients who did receive PT-CY. Three-year overall survival was 28% in no PT-CY patients and 38% in PT-CY patients. In multivariable analysis, the main risk factors were the intensity of the conditioning regimen and the use of PT-CY. In conclusion, the outcomes of MDS patients who received an haploidentical transplant are close to the results other transplantations from HLA-mismatched donors with approximately one-third of patients alive and free of disease 3 years after transplant, and the use of PT-CY may improve their outcomes.","['Robin, Marie', 'Porcher, Raphael', 'Ciceri, Fabio', 'van Lint, Maria Teresa', 'Santarone, Stella', 'Ehninger, Gerhard', 'Blaise, Didier', 'Gullbas, Zafer', 'Gonzales Muniz, Soledad', 'Michallet, Mauricette', 'Velardi, Andrea', 'Koster, Linda', 'Maertens, Johan', 'Sierra, Jorge', 'Selleslag, Dominik', 'Radujkovic, Aleksandar', 'Diez-Martin, Jose L', 'Kanz, Lothar', 'Arroyo, Concepcion Herrera', 'Niederwieser, Dietger', 'Huang, He', 'McDonald, Andrew', 'de Witte, Theo', 'Koc, Yener', 'Kroger, Nicolaus']","['Robin M', 'Porcher R', 'Ciceri F', 'van Lint MT', 'Santarone S', 'Ehninger G', 'Blaise D', 'Gullbas Z', 'Gonzales Muniz S', 'Michallet M', 'Velardi A', 'Koster L', 'Maertens J', 'Sierra J', 'Selleslag D', 'Radujkovic A', 'Diez-Martin JL', 'Kanz L', 'Arroyo CH', 'Niederwieser D', 'Huang H', 'McDonald A', 'de Witte T', 'Koc Y', 'Kroger N']","['Hospital Saint-Louis, Assistance Publique Hopitaux de Paris, INSERM 1131, University Paris 7, Paris, France.', 'Team methods, Epidemiology and Statistics Sorbonne Paris Cite Research Centre, Unite Mixte de Recherche 1153, INSERM, Paris Descartes University, Paris, France.', 'Epidemiology Center, Assistance Publique Hopitaux de Paris, Hopital Hotel-Dieu, Paris, France.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, San Raffaele Hospital, Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology, San Martino Hospital, Genoa, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology, Civil Hospital, Pescara, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Dresden University Hospital, Dresden, Germany.', 'Department Hematology, Paoli Calmettes Institute, Marseille, France.', 'Hematologic Oncology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, Anadolu Medical Center Hospital, Kocaeli, Turkey.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Asturias Central University Hospital, Oviedo, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Lyon Sud Hospital, Lyon, France.', 'Division of Hematology and Clinical Immunology, Perugia University, Perugia, Italy.', 'European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation Data Office, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital Gasthuisberg, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Hospital Santa Creu i Sant Pau, Barcelona, Spain.', 'A.Z.

However, these therapies also have effects on T cells in CLL by mediating toxicity and possibly controlling disease. By focusing on the effects of BCR signaling inhibitors on the T-cell compartment, we may gain new insights into the comprehensive biological outcomes of systemic treatment to further understand mechanisms of drug efficacy, predict the toxicity or adverse events, and identify novel combinatorial therapies. Here, we review T-cell abnormalities in preclinical models and patient samples, finding that CLL T cells orchestrate immune dysfunction and immune-related complications. We then continue to address the effects of clinically available small molecule BCR signaling inhibitors on the immune cells, especially T cells, in the context of concomitant immune-mediated adverse events and implications for future treatment strategies. Our review suggests potentially novel mechanisms of action related to BCR inhibitors, providing a rationale to extend their use to other cancers and autoimmune disorders.","['Maharaj, Kamira', 'Sahakian, Eva', 'Pinilla-Ibarz, Javier']","['Maharaj K', 'Sahakian E', 'Pinilla-Ibarz J']","['Department of Immunology, H.

Using real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, we showed that BAALC expression is significantly lower in APL compared with other subsets of AML (P < .001). We also demonstrated that BAALC overexpression was associated with shorter disease-free survival (DFS) (hazard ratio [HR], 4.43; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.29-15.2; P = .018) in 221 consecutive patients (median age, 35 years; range, 18-82 years) with newly diagnosed APL homogeneously treated with all-trans retinoic acid and anthracycline-based chemotherapy. Cox proportional hazard modeling showed that BAALC overexpression was independently associated with shorter DFS in the total cohort (HR, 5.26; 95% CI, 1.52-18.2; P = .009) and in patients with high-risk disease (ie, those with initial leukocyte counts >10 x 10(9)/L) (HR, 5.3; 95% CI, 1.14-24.5; P = .033).

We investigated whether different BM sites could differently modulate T-ALL propagation using in vivo animal models. We observed that mouse and human T-ALL develop slowly in the BM of tail vertebrae compared with the BM from thorax vertebrae. T-ALL recovered from tail BM displays lower cell-surface marker expression and decreased metabolism and cell-cycle progression, demonstrating a dormancy phenotype. Functionally, tail-derived T-ALL exhibit a deficient short-term ex vivo growth and a delayed in vivo propagation. These features are noncell-autonomous because T-ALL from tail and thorax shares identical genomic abnormalities and functional disparities disappear in vivo and in prolonged in vitro assays. Importantly tail-derived T-ALL displays higher intrinsic resistance to cell-cycle-related drugs (ie, vincristine sulfate and cytarabine). Of note, T-ALL recovered from gonadal adipose tissues or from cocultures with adipocytes shares metabolic, cell-cycle, and phenotypic or chemoresistance features, with tail-derived T-ALL suggesting adipocytes may participate in the tail BM imprints on T-ALL. Altogether these results demonstrate that BM sites differentially orchestrate T-ALL propagation stamping specific features to leukemic cells such as quiescence and decreased response to cell-cycle-dependent chemotherapy.","['Cahu, Xavier', 'Calvo, Julien', 'Poglio, Sandrine', 'Prade, Nais', 'Colsch, Benoit', 'Arcangeli, Marie-Laure', 'Leblanc, Thierry', 'Petit, Arnaud', 'Baleydier, Frederic', 'Baruchel, Andre', 'Landman-Parker, Judith', 'Junot, Christophe', 'Larghero, Jerome', 'Ballerini, Paola', 'Delabesse, Eric', 'Uzan, Benjamin', 'Pflumio, Francoise']","['Cahu X', 'Calvo J', 'Poglio S', 'Prade N', 'Colsch B', 'Arcangeli ML', 'Leblanc T', 'Petit A', 'Baleydier F', 'Baruchel A', 'Landman-Parker J', 'Junot C', 'Larghero J', 'Ballerini P', 'Delabesse E', 'Uzan B', 'Pflumio F']","[""Laboratoire de Recherche sur les Cellules Souches Hematopoietiques et Leucemiques, Equipe Labellisee Ligue Nationale contre le Cancer, Institut de Radiobiologie Cellulaire et Moleculaire, Commissariat a l'energie Atomique et aux Energies Alternatives (CEA), Fontenay-aux-Roses, France."", 'INSERM, Unite 967, Fontenay-aux-Roses, France.', 'Universite Paris Diderot, Paris 7, Fontenay-aux-Roses, France.', 'Universite Paris Sud, Paris 11, Fontenay-aux-Roses, France.', ""Laboratoire de Recherche sur les Cellules Souches Hematopoietiques et Leucemiques, Equipe Labellisee Ligue Nationale contre le Cancer, Institut de Radiobiologie Cellulaire et Moleculaire, Commissariat a l'energie Atomique et aux Energies Alternatives (CEA), Fontenay-aux-Roses, France."", 'INSERM, Unite 967, Fontenay-aux-Roses, France.', 'Universite Paris Diderot, Paris 7, Fontenay-aux-Roses, France.', 'Universite Paris Sud, Paris 11, Fontenay-aux-Roses, France.', ""Laboratoire de Recherche sur les Cellules Souches Hematopoietiques et Leucemiques, Equipe Labellisee Ligue Nationale contre le Cancer, Institut de Radiobiologie Cellulaire et Moleculaire, Commissariat a l'energie Atomique et aux Energies Alternatives (CEA), Fontenay-aux-Roses, France."", 'INSERM, Unite 967, Fontenay-aux-Roses, France.', 'Universite Paris Diderot, Paris 7, Fontenay-aux-Roses, France.', 'Universite Paris Sud, Paris 11, Fontenay-aux-Roses, France.', ""Laboratoire d'Hematologie, INSERM U1037, Toulouse, France."", 'Universite Paul Sabatier, Toulouse, France.', ""Laboratoire d'Etude du Metabolisme des Medicaments, CEA-Institut National pour la Recherche Agronomique Unite Mixte de Recherche 0496, Direction de la Recherche Fondamentale/Institut de Biologie et de Technologie de Saclay/Service de Pharmacologie et d'Immunologie, Universite Paris Saclay, MetaboHUB, Gif-sur-Yvette, France."", ""Laboratoire de Recherche sur les Cellules Souches Hematopoietiques et Leucemiques, Equipe Labellisee Ligue Nationale contre le Cancer, Institut de Radiobiologie Cellulaire et Moleculaire, Commissariat a l'energie Atomique et aux Energies Alternatives (CEA), Fontenay-aux-Roses, France."", 'INSERM, Unite 967, Fontenay-aux-Roses, France.', 'Universite Paris Diderot, Paris 7, Fontenay-aux-Roses, France.', 'Universite Paris Sud, Paris 11, Fontenay-aux-Roses, France.', ""Service d'Hemato-Immunologie Pediatrique, Hopital Robert Debre, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris (AP-HP), Universite Paris Diderot, Paris, France."", ""AP-HP, Service d'Hematologie Pediatrique, Hopital A.

In contrast to a majority of murine B-cell malignancies, which stain positive with the B220 antibody, we discovered a novel form of B-cell leukemia in NUP98-PHF23 (NP23) transgenic mice. The immunophenotype (Lin(-) B220(-) CD19(+) AA4.1(+)) was identical to that of progenitor (pro) B-1 cells, and VH gene usage was skewed toward 3' V regions, similar to murine fetal liver B cells. Moreover, the gene expression profile of these leukemias was most similar to that of fetal liver pro-B fraction BC, a known source of B-1 B cells, further supporting a pro-B-1 origin of these leukemias. The NP23 pro-B-1 acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALLs) acquired spontaneous mutations in both Bcor and Janus kinase (Jak) pathway (Jak1/2/3 and Stat5a) genes, supporting a hypothesis that mutations in 3 critical pathways (stem-cell self-renewal, B-cell differentiation, and cytokine signaling) collaborate to induce B-cell precursor (BCP) ALL. Finally, the thymic stromal lymphopoietin (Tslp) cytokine is required for murine B-1 development, and chromosomal rearrangements resulting in overexpression of the TSLP receptor (CRLF2) are present in some patients with high-risk BCP-ALL (referred to as CRLF2r ALL). Gene expression profiles of NP23 pro-B-1 ALL were more similar to that of CRLF2r ALL than non-CRLF2r ALL, and analysis of VH gene usage from patients with CRLF2r ALL demonstrated preferential usage of VH regions used by human B-1 B cells, leading to the suggestion that this subset of patients with BCP-ALL has a malignancy of B-1, rather than B-2, B-cell origin.","['Gough, Sheryl M', 'Goldberg, Liat', 'Pineda, Marbin', 'Walker, Robert L', 'Zhu, Yuelin J', 'Bilke, Sven', 'Chung, Yang Jo', 'Dufraine, Joseph', 'Kundu, Subhadip', 'Jacoby, Elad', 'Fry, Terry J', 'Fischer, Susanna', 'Panzer-Grumayer, Renate', 'Meltzer, Paul S', 'Aplan, Peter D']","['Gough SM', 'Goldberg L', 'Pineda M', 'Walker RL', 'Zhu YJ', 'Bilke S', 'Chung YJ', 'Dufraine J', 'Kundu S', 'Jacoby E', 'Fry TJ', 'Fischer S', 'Panzer-Grumayer R', 'Meltzer PS', 'Aplan PD']","['Genetics Branch and.', 'Genetics Branch and.', 'Genetics Branch and.', 'Genetics Branch and.', 'Genetics Branch and.', 'Genetics Branch and.', 'Genetics Branch and.', 'Genetics Branch and.', 'Genetics Branch and.', 'Pediatric Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD.', 'Pediatric Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD.', ""Leukemia Biology Group, Children's Cancer Research Institute, Vienna, Austria; and."", ""Leukemia Biology Group, Children's Cancer Research Institute, Vienna, Austria; and."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Genetics Branch and.', 'Genetics Branch and.']",['eng'],"['Z01 BC010983/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States', 'ZIA SC010378/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States']",['Journal Article'],20170908,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,PMC5728343,,,2018/01/04 06:00,2018/01/04 06:01,['2018/01/04 06:00'],"['2017/06/26 00:00 [received]', '2017/08/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/01/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/04 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1182/bloodadvances.2017009837 [doi]', '2017/009837 [pii]']",epublish,Blood Adv. 2017 Sep 8;1(20):1749-1759. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2017009837. eCollection 2017 Sep 12.,,20,,,,,,"['Conflict-of-interest disclosure: The authors declare no competing financial', 'interests.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To determine if inherited genetic susceptibility contributes to these differences we performed 2 genome-wide association studies (GWAS) by age, sex, and subtype and subsequent meta-analyses. The GWAS included 446 B-ALL cases, and 3027 healthy unrelated blood and marrow transplant (BMT) donors as controls from the Determining the Influence of Susceptibility Conveying Variants Related to One-Year Mortality after BMT (DISCOVeRY-BMT) study.

The Trib1-COP1 complex is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that targets C/EBPalpha for degradation, and its overexpression specifically induces acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Here we show that myeloid leukemia factor 1 (MLF1) stabilizes C/EBPalpha protein levels by inhibiting the ligase activity of the Trib1-COP1 complex. MLF1 directly interacts with COP1 in the nucleus and interferes with the formation of the Trib1-COP1 complex, thereby blocking its ability to polyubiquitinate C/EBPalpha for degradation. MLF1 overexpression suppressed the Trib1-induced growth advantage in a murine bone marrow (BM) culture and Trib1-induced AML development in BM-transplanted mouse models. MLF1 was expressed in hematopoietic stem cells and myeloid progenitors (common myeloid progenitors and granulocyte-macrophage progenitors) in normal hematopoiesis, which is consistent with the distribution of C/EBPalpha. An MLF1 deficiency conferred a more immature phenotype on Trib1-induced AML development. A higher expression ratio of Trib1 to MLF1 was a key determinant for AML development in mouse models, which was also confirmed in human patient samples with acute leukemia. These results indicate that MLF1 is a positive regulator that is critical for C/EBPalpha stability in the early phases of hematopoiesis and leukemogenesis.","['Nakamae, Ikuko', 'Kato, Jun-Ya', 'Yokoyama, Takashi', 'Ito, Hidenori', 'Yoneda-Kato, Noriko']","['Nakamae I', 'Kato JY', 'Yokoyama T', 'Ito H', 'Yoneda-Kato N']","['Department of Tumor Cell Biology, Graduate School of Biological Sciences, Nara Institute of Science and Technology, Ikoma, Japan.', 'Department of Tumor Cell Biology, Graduate School of Biological Sciences, Nara Institute of Science and Technology, Ikoma, Japan.', 'Department of Tumor Cell Biology, Graduate School of Biological Sciences, Nara Institute of Science and Technology, Ikoma, Japan.', 'Department of Tumor Cell Biology, Graduate School of Biological Sciences, Nara Institute of Science and Technology, Ikoma, Japan.', 'Department of Tumor Cell Biology, Graduate School of Biological Sciences, Nara Institute of Science and Technology, Ikoma, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20170901,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,PMC5728337,,,2018/01/04 06:00,2018/01/04 06:01,['2018/01/04 06:00'],"['2017/03/22 00:00 [received]', '2017/07/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/01/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/04 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1182/bloodadvances.2017007054 [doi]', '2017/007054 [pii]']",epublish,Blood Adv. 2017 Sep 1;1(20):1682-1693. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2017007054. eCollection 2017 Sep 12.,,20,,,,,,"['Conflict-of-interest disclosure: The authors declare no competing financial', 'interests.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The genetic landscape of Ph-like ALL is characterized by a diverse array of kinase-activating alterations (including rearrangements, sequence mutations, and copy number alterations), suggesting that patients with Ph-like ALL are candidates for targeted therapy, similar to BCR-ABL1 ALL. We sought to investigate the functional role and targetability of the spectrum of kinase-activating alterations identified in Ph-like ALL. We demonstrate cytokine-independent growth and activation of JAK-STAT signaling pathways in Ba/F3 cells by all alterations tested. The development of murine Arf(-/-) pre-B ALL expressing RCSD1-ABL2 or SSBP2-CSF1R was accelerated with the presence of IK6, a dominant negative isoform of Ikaros common in Ph-like ALL, providing evidence that these fusions are leukemogenic. In vitro screening using a panel of tyrosine kinase inhibitors against 14 different kinase alterations identified the ABL1-inhibitor, dasatinib, as a potent inhibitor of ABL-class fusions (ABL1, ABL2, CSF1R, PDGFRB), whereas the JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor ruxolitinib, was most effective against JAK-STAT-activating alterations (JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, IL7R, IL2RB), but not TYK2. Evaluation of dasatinib or ruxolitinib against patient-derived xenograft models demonstrated superior antileukemic efficacy when combined with dexamethasone compared with either agent alone. These data provide the foundation for rationally designed clinical trials that assess the efficacy of targeted therapy in patients with Ph-like ALL.","['Roberts, Kathryn G', 'Yang, Yung-Li', 'Payne-Turner, Debbie', 'Lin, Wenwei', 'Files, Jacob K', 'Dickerson, Kirsten', 'Gu, Zhaohui', 'Taunton, Jack', 'Janke, Laura J', 'Chen, Taosheng', 'Loh, Mignon L', 'Hunger, Stephen P', 'Mullighan, Charles G']","['Roberts KG', 'Yang YL', 'Payne-Turner D', 'Lin W', 'Files JK', 'Dickerson K', 'Gu Z', 'Taunton J', 'Janke LJ', 'Chen T', 'Loh ML', 'Hunger SP', 'Mullighan CG']","['Department of Pathology and.', 'Department of Pathology and.', 'Department of Pathology and.', ""Department of Chemical Biology and Therapeutics, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", 'Department of Pathology and.', 'Department of Pathology and.', 'Integrated Biomedical Sciences Program, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, TN.', 'Department of Pathology and.', 'Department of Cellular and Molecular Pharmacology.', 'Department of Pathology and.', ""Department of Chemical Biology and Therapeutics, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", ""Department of Pediatrics, UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital, and."", 'Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA; and.', ""Department of Pediatrics and Center for Childhood Research, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, and."", 'Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA.', 'Department of Pathology and.']",['eng'],"['P30 CA021765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R25 CA023944/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180886/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180899/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['Journal Article'],20170830,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,PMC5728345,,,2018/01/04 06:00,2018/01/04 06:01,['2018/01/04 06:00'],"['2017/08/03 00:00 [received]', '2017/08/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/01/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/04 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1182/bloodadvances.2017011296 [doi]', '2017/011296 [pii]']",epublish,Blood Adv. 2017 Aug 30;1(20):1657-1671. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2017011296. eCollection 2017 Sep 12.,,20,,,,['ORCID: 0000-0002-1871-1851'],,"['Conflict-of-interest disclosure: S.P.H. has received consulting fees from', 'Novartis and honoraria from Amgen.

In this article, we show that EPHB4 is highly expressed in approximately 30% of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) samples. In an unbiased RNA interference screen of primary leukemia samples, we found that EPHB4 drives survival in a subset of AML cases. Knockdown of EPHB4 inhibits phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT signaling, and this is accompanied by a reduction in cell viability, which can be rescued by a constitutively active form of AKT. Finally, targeting EPHB4 with a highly specific monoclonal antibody (MAb131) is effective against AML in vitro and in vivo. EPHB4 is therefore a potential target in AML with high EPHB4 expression.","['Merchant, Akil A', 'Jorapur, Aparna', 'McManus, Amy', 'Liu, Ren', 'Krasnoperov, Valery', 'Chaudhry, Parvesh', 'Singh, Mohan', 'Harton, Lisa', 'Agajanian, Mary', 'Kim, Miriam', 'Triche, Timothy J Jr', 'Druker, Brian J', 'Tyner, Jeffrey W', 'Gill, Parkash S']","['Merchant AA', 'Jorapur A', 'McManus A', 'Liu R', 'Krasnoperov V', 'Chaudhry P', 'Singh M', 'Harton L', 'Agajanian M', 'Kim M', 'Triche TJ Jr', 'Druker BJ', 'Tyner JW', 'Gill PS']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA.', 'Vasgene Therapeutics, Inc, Los Angeles, CA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA.', 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology and.', 'Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, OR.', 'Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Chevy Chase, MD; and.', 'Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, OR.', 'Department of Cell, Developmental, and Cancer Biology, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, OR.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA.']",['eng'],"['K08 CA154975/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA014089/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R00 CA151457/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['Journal Article'],20170828,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,PMC5728330,,,2018/01/04 06:00,2018/01/04 06:01,['2018/01/04 06:00'],"['2017/02/09 00:00 [received]', '2017/07/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/01/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/04 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1182/bloodadvances.2017005694 [doi]', '2017/005694 [pii]']",epublish,Blood Adv. 2017 Aug 28;1(20):1635-1644. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2017005694. eCollection 2017 Sep 12.,,20,,,,,,"['Conflict-of-interest disclosure: A.A.M. received research funding and served as a', 'consultant for Pfizer, Inc.

The 19-year-old female patient presented with B symptoms, pancytopenia, and circulating blasts. The bone marrow aspirate was hypercellular and was infiltrated by an immature blast population that was confirmed as B-ALL by flow cytometry. Sequential fluorescent in situ hybridization was performed on the patient's leukemic cells, which were shown to contain both ETV6-RUNX1 and BCR-ABL1 gene rearrangements. The majority of nuclei (85%) showed only the ETV6-RUNX1 gene rearrangement; however, an additional 10% also showed a variant BCR-ABL1 gene rearrangement, indicating the ETV6-RUNX1 gene rearrangement was the primary change. A review of the literature has shown that acquisition of a BCR-ABL1 gene rearrangement as a secondary change in B-ALL is a very rare occurrence, and the effect it may have on prognosis is uncertain in the modern therapy age.","['Dun, Karen A', 'Vanhaeften, Rob', 'Batt, Tracey J', 'Riley, Louise A', 'Diano, Giuseppe', 'Williamson, Jan']","['Dun KA', 'Vanhaeften R', 'Batt TJ', 'Riley LA', 'Diano G', 'Williamson J']","['Cytogenetics Laboratory.', 'Molecular Medicine Laboratory, and.', 'Department of Haematology, Royal Hobart Hospital, Hobart, TAS, Australia.', 'Cytogenetics Laboratory.', 'Cytogenetics Laboratory.', 'Molecular Medicine Laboratory, and.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20161130,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,PMC5737165,,,2016/11/30 00:00,2016/11/30 00:01,['2018/01/04 06:00'],"['2016/08/15 00:00 [received]', '2016/10/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/11/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '2016/11/30 00:01 [medline]']","['10.1182/bloodadvances.2016000463 [doi]', '2016/000463 [pii]']",epublish,Blood Adv. 2016 Nov 30;1(2):132-138. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2016000463. eCollection 2016 Dec 13.,,2,,,,,,"['Conflict-of-interest disclosure: The authors declare no competing financial', 'interests.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To evaluate the safety and activity of idelalisib in combination with immunotherapy, chemotherapy, or both, 79 patients with relapsed/refractory iNHL were enrolled based on investigator preference in 3 treatment groups. Patients received continuous idelalisib in combination with (1) rituximab (IR; 375 mg/m(2) weekly x 8 doses), (2) bendamustine (IB; 90 mg/m(2) per day x 2, for 6 cycles), or (3) both bendamustine and rituximab at aforementioned doses (IBR; monthly x 6 cycles). Patients had a median age of 61 years, a median of 3 prior therapies, and 46% had refractory disease. The overall response rate was 75% (22% complete response) for IR, 88% (36%) for IB, and 79% (43%) for IBR. The median progression-free survival was 37.1 months overall: 29.7 months for IR, 32.8 for IB, and 37.1 months for IBR. The median duration of response was 28.6 months in the IR group and has not been reached in the IB and IBR groups. The most common grade >/=3 adverse events and laboratory abnormalities were neutropenia (41%), pneumonia (19%), transaminase elevations (16%), diarrhea/colitis (15%), and rash (9%).

DNA sequence variants/mutations other than JAK2/CALR/MPL were detected in 147 patients (81%), with the most frequent being ASXL1 (36%), TET2 (18%), SRSF2 (18%), and U2AF1 (16%); furthermore, 35%, 26%, 10%, and 9% of the patients harbored 1, 2, 3, or 4 or more such variants/mutations, respectively. Adverse variants/mutations were identified by age-adjusted multivariable analysis of impact on overall survival or leukemia-free survival and included ASXL1, SRSF2, CBL, KIT, RUNX1, SH2B3, and CEBPA; their combined prevalence was 56%. Adverse variants/mutations were associated with inferior overall survival (median, 3.6 vs 8.5 years; P < .001) and leukemia-free survival (7-year risk, 25% vs 4%; P < .001), and the effect on survival was independent of both the Dynamic International Prognostic Scoring System Plus and JAK2/CALR/MPL mutational status, with respective hazard ratios of 2.0 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3-3.1) and 2.9 (95% CI, 1.9-4.4). Additional prognostic information was obtained by considering the number of adverse variants/mutations; median survivals in patients with zero (n = 80), 1 or 2 (n = 93), or 3 or more (n = 9) adverse variants/mutations were 8.5, 4, and 0.7 years, respectively (P < .001). Additional data were obtained on pattern of mutation co-segregation and phenotypic correlation, including significant associations between U2AF1 and JAK2 mutations (P = .04) and U2AF1 mutations and anemia (P = .003) and thrombocytopenia (P = .006).

Although studies of posttransplant immune reconstitution have identified correlates of clinical outcome, the number and profile of mature immune cells infused with the stem cell graft is also likely to be an important determinant and has been relatively poorly studied. We characterized immune cells within the stem cell graft of 107 patients who underwent T-cell-depleted allo-HSCT and related this to clinical outcome. The number of natural killer (NK) cells and T cells that were infused varied markedly between patients, but T-cell dose was not an important factor in subsequent outcome. In contrast, the number of NK cells was a powerful determinant of the risk of disease relapse. Patients who received an NK cell dose below the median level of 6.3 x 10(6) cells per kg had a relapse rate of 40% at 2 years posttransplant compared with only 6% for those whose stem cell graft contained a dose above this value. Analysis of NK subsets showed that this effect was mediated primarily by the CD56(dim) population of mature effector cells and that high-level expression of the activatory protein DNAM on donor NK cells was also strongly protective. These observations offer important insights into the mechanism of GVL and suggest that optimization studies of the number of NK cells within the stem cell graft should be considered as a means to reduce disease relapse.","['Maggs, Luke', 'Kinsella, Francesca', 'Chan, Y L Tracey', 'Eldershaw, Suzy', 'Murray, Duncan', 'Nunnick, Jane', 'Bird, Joanne', 'Craddock, Charles', 'Zuo, Jianmin', 'Malladi, Ram', 'Moss, Paul']","['Maggs L', 'Kinsella F', 'Chan YLT', 'Eldershaw S', 'Murray D', 'Nunnick J', 'Bird J', 'Craddock C', 'Zuo J', 'Malladi R', 'Moss P']","['Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy, College of Medical and Dental Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom; and.', 'Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy, College of Medical and Dental Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom; and.', 'Birmingham Health Partners, Department of Haematology, Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Birmingham, United Kingdom.', 'Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy, College of Medical and Dental Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom; and.', 'Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy, College of Medical and Dental Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom; and.', 'Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy, College of Medical and Dental Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom; and.', 'Birmingham Health Partners, Department of Haematology, Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Birmingham, United Kingdom.', 'Birmingham Health Partners, Department of Haematology, Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Birmingham, United Kingdom.', 'Birmingham Health Partners, Department of Haematology, Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Birmingham, United Kingdom.', 'Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy, College of Medical and Dental Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom; and.', 'Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy, College of Medical and Dental Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom; and.', 'Birmingham Health Partners, Department of Haematology, Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Birmingham, United Kingdom.', 'Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy, College of Medical and Dental Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom; and.', 'Birmingham Health Partners, Department of Haematology, Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Birmingham, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['G110379/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'MR/K021192/1/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom']",['Journal Article'],20170821,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,PMC5728471,,,2018/01/04 06:00,2018/01/04 06:01,['2018/01/04 06:00'],"['2017/05/22 00:00 [received]', '2017/07/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/01/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/04 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1182/bloodadvances.2017008631 [doi]', '2017/008631 [pii]']",epublish,Blood Adv. 2017 Aug 21;1(19):1589-1597. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2017008631. eCollection 2017 Aug 22.,,19,,,,,,"['Conflict-of-interest disclosure: The authors declare no competing financial', 'interests.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, ibrutinib must be discontinued in a subset of patients due to progressive CLL or transformation to aggressive lymphoma (Richter transformation). Transformation occurs early in the course of therapy and has an extremely poor prognosis. Thus, identification of prognostic markers associated with transformation is of utmost importance. Near-tetraploidy (4 copies of most chromosomes within a cell) has been reported in various lymphomas, but its incidence and significance in CLL has not been described. Using fluorescence in situ hybridization, we detected near-tetraploidy in 9 of 297 patients with CLL prior to beginning ibrutinib treatment on 1 of 4 clinical trials (3.0%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.4%-5.7%). Near-tetraploidy was associated with aggressive disease characteristics: Rai stage 3/4 (P = .03), deletion 17p (P = .03), and complex karyotype (P = .01). Near-tetraploidy was also associated with ibrutinib discontinuation due to Richter transformation (P < .0001), but not due to progressive CLL (P = .41). Of the 9 patients with near-tetraploidy, 6 had Richter transformation with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. In a multivariable model, near-tetraploidy (hazard ratio [HR], 8.66; 95% CI, 3.83-19.59; P < .0001) and complex karyotype (HR, 4.77; 95% CI, 1.42-15.94; P = .01) were independent risk factors for discontinuing ibrutinib due to transformation.

We identified an antibody, AT1413, that was of donor origin and that specifically recognizes a novel sialylated epitope on CD43 (CD43s).

In contrast, simultaneous NPM1 and FLT3 tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) mutations were reported to improve response over that of an isolated NPM1 mutation in one as yet unverified report. To validate this, we explored the impact of the co-occurrence of FLT3-TKD and NPM1 mutations on clinical outcomes. Study populations included 21 patients (8%) with FLT3-TKD(+)NPM1(+) mutated, 18 patients (7%) with FLT3-TKD-only-mutated, 117 patients (44%) with NPM1-only-mutated, and 107 patients (41%) with FLT3-ITD(+)NPM1-mutated AML. Compared with NPM1(+) -only-mutated AML, FLT3-TKD/NPM1 double mutation status was associated with a significantly superior relapse-free survival (median, not reached vs 18.3 months; P = .03) and a trend toward improved overall survival (OS). The presence of FLT3-TKD/NPM1 double mutation status was an independent positive predictor in multivariable analysis. Allogeneic stem cell transplant did not improve outcomes in the FLT3-TKD/NPM1 cohort. Consistent with historical data, the co-mutation status defined a highly favorable prognostic group characterized by high response rates and prolonged disease-free and OS. These study findings substantiate previous data describing this intriguing paradoxical cooperative effect. Our results emphasize the need for elucidating the mechanistic links between FLT3-TKD and NPM1 in future molecular and murine model studies.","['Boddu, Prajwal', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Borthakur, Gautam', 'Kadia, Tapan', 'Daver, Naval', 'Pierce, Sherry', 'Andreeff, Michael', 'Ravandi, Farhad', 'Cortes, Jorge', 'Kornblau, Steven M']","['Boddu P', 'Kantarjian H', 'Borthakur G', 'Kadia T', 'Daver N', 'Pierce S', 'Andreeff M', 'Ravandi F', 'Cortes J', 'Kornblau SM']","['Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.']",['eng'],"['P01 CA049639/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['Journal Article'],20170817,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,PMC5728474,,,2018/01/04 06:00,2018/01/04 06:01,['2018/01/04 06:00'],"['2017/06/02 00:00 [received]', '2017/07/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/01/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/04 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1182/bloodadvances.2017009019 [doi]', '2017/009019 [pii]']",epublish,Blood Adv. 2017 Aug 17;1(19):1546-1550. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2017009019. eCollection 2017 Aug 22.,,19,,,,,,"['Conflict-of-interest disclosure: The authors declare no competing financial', 'interests.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, their clinical and prognostic relevance in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs) remains unclear to date. In this study, we profiled lncRNA expressions in 176 adult patients with primary MDS, and identified 4 lncRNAs whose expression levels were significantly associated with overall survival (OS). We then constructed a risk-scoring system with the weighted sum of these 4 lncRNAs. Higher lncRNA scores were associated with higher marrow blast percentages, higher-risk subtypes of MDSs (based on both the Revised International Prognostic Scoring System [IPSS-R] and World Health Organization classification), complex cytogenetic changes, and mutations in RUNX1, ASXL1, TP53, SRSF2, and ZRSR2, whereas they were inversely correlated with SF3B1 mutation. Patients with higher lncRNA scores had a significantly shorter OS and a higher 5-year leukemic transformation rate compared with those with lower scores. The prognostic significance of our 4-lncRNA risk score could be validated in an independent MDS cohort. In multivariate analysis, higher lncRNA scores remained an independent unfavorable risk factor for OS (relative risk, 4.783; P < .001) irrespective of age, cytogenetics, IPSS-R, and gene mutations. To our knowledge, this is the first report to provide a lncRNA platform for risk stratification of MDS patients. In conclusion, our integrated 4-lncRNA risk-scoring system is correlated with distinctive clinical and biological features in MDS patients, and serves as an independent prognostic factor for survival and leukemic transformation. This concise yet powerful lncRNA-based scoring system holds the potential to improve the current risk stratification of MDS patients.","['Yao, Chi-Yuan', 'Chen, Ching-Hsuan', 'Huang, Huai-Hsuan', 'Hou, Hsin-An', 'Lin, Chien-Chin', 'Tseng, Mei-Hsuan', 'Kao, Chein-Jun', 'Lu, Tzu-Pin', 'Chou, Wen-Chien', 'Tien, Hwei-Fang']","['Yao CY', 'Chen CH', 'Huang HH', 'Hou HA', 'Lin CC', 'Tseng MH', 'Kao CJ', 'Lu TP', 'Chou WC', 'Tien HF']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, and.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan; and.', 'Graduate Institute of Clinical Medicine, College of Medicine, and.', 'Institute of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, and.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, and.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, and.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan; and.', 'Graduate Institute of Clinical Medicine, College of Medicine, and.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, and.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, and.', 'Institute of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, and.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan; and.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, and.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20170816,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,PMC5728469,,,2018/01/04 06:00,2018/01/04 06:01,['2018/01/04 06:00'],"['2017/05/09 00:00 [received]', '2017/07/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/01/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/04 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1182/bloodadvances.2017008284 [doi]', '2017/008284 [pii]']",epublish,Blood Adv. 2017 Aug 16;1(19):1505-1516. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2017008284. eCollection 2017 Aug 22.,,19,,,,,,"['Conflict-of-interest disclosure: The authors declare no competing financial', 'interests.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we report that this bidirectional function of RUNX1 possibly arises from the total level of RUNX family expressions. Indeed, analysis of clinical data revealed that intermediate-level gene expression of RUNX1 marked the poorest-prognostic cohort in relation to AML patients with high- or low-level RUNX1 expressions. Through a series of RUNX1 knockdown experiments with various RUNX1 attenuation potentials, we found that moderate attenuation of RUNX1 contributed to the enhanced propagation of AML cells through accelerated cell-cycle progression, whereas profound RUNX1 depletion led to cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis. In these RUNX1-silenced tumors, amounts of compensative upregulation of RUNX2 and RUNX3 expressions were roughly equivalent and created an absolute elevation of total RUNX (RUNX1 + RUNX2 + RUNX3) expression levels in RUNX1 moderately attenuated AML cells. This elevation resulted in enhanced transactivation of glutathione S-transferase alpha 2 (GSTA2) expression, a vital enzyme handling the catabolization of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) as well as advancing the cell-cycle progressions, and thus ultimately led to the acquisition of proliferative advantage in RUNX1 moderately attenuated AML cells. Besides, treatment with ethacrynic acid, which is known for its GSTA inhibiting property, actually prolonged the survival of AML mice in vivo. Collectively, our findings indicate that moderately attenuated RUNX1 expressions paradoxically enhance leukemogenesis in AML cells through intracellular environmental change via GSTA2, which could be a novel therapeutic target in antileukemia strategy.","['Morita, Ken', 'Maeda, Shintaro', 'Suzuki, Kensho', 'Kiyose, Hiroki', 'Taniguchi, Junichi', 'Liu, Pu Paul', 'Sugiyama, Hiroshi', 'Adachi, Souichi', 'Kamikubo, Yasuhiko']","['Morita K', 'Maeda S', 'Suzuki K', 'Kiyose H', 'Taniguchi J', 'Liu PP', 'Sugiyama H', 'Adachi S', 'Kamikubo Y']","['Department of Human Health Sciences, Graduate School of Medicine, and.', 'Department of Human Health Sciences, Graduate School of Medicine, and.', 'Department of Human Health Sciences, Graduate School of Medicine, and.', 'Department of Human Health Sciences, Graduate School of Medicine, and.', 'Department of Chemistry, Graduate School of Science, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Oncogenesis and Development Section, National Human Genome Research Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD; and.', 'Department of Chemistry, Graduate School of Science, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Human Health Sciences, Graduate School of Medicine, and.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Human Health Sciences, Graduate School of Medicine, and.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20170808,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,PMC5727854,,,2018/01/04 06:00,2018/01/04 06:01,['2018/01/04 06:00'],"['2017/04/11 00:00 [received]', '2017/07/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/01/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/04 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1182/bloodadvances.2017007591 [doi]', '2017/007591 [pii]']",epublish,Blood Adv. 2017 Aug 8;1(18):1440-1451. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2017007591. eCollection 2017 Aug 8.,,18,,,,,,"['Conflict-of-interest disclosure: The authors declare no competing financial', 'interests.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, targeting these protective mechanisms could eradicate therapy-resistant cancer cells and improve outcomes. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) provides extrinsic protection for several solid tumors and multiple myeloma. In pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML), IL-6-induced STAT3 signaling frequently becomes stronger at relapse, and increases in IL-6-induced STAT3 activity are associated with inferior survival after relapse. These findings suggested that the IL-6-induced STAT3 pathway may promote chemotherapy resistance and disease progression. Thus, we investigated the dysregulation of IL-6 levels in the bone marrow niche in pediatric patients with AML and the association between IL-6 levels and outcome. We measured levels of over 40 cytokines and growth factors in plasma from diagnostic bone marrow aspirates of 45 pediatric AML patients and 7 healthy sibling controls. Of the measured cytokines, only IL-6 levels were associated with event-free survival. Importantly, the effect of elevated IL-6 was most striking among children classified as having a low risk of relapse. In these patients, 5-year event-free survival was 82.5% +/- 11% for patients with low IL-6 levels at diagnosis (n = 14) compared with 17.3% +/- 11% for patients with elevated IL-6 (n = 13, log-rank P = .0003). In vitro, exogenous IL-6 reduced mitoxantrone-induced apoptosis in cell lines and primary pediatric AML samples. These results suggest that IL-6 levels at diagnosis could be used to help identify children at high risk of relapse, particularly those who are otherwise classified as low risk by current algorithms. Moreover, the IL-6 pathway could represent a target for overcoming environment-mediated chemotherapy resistance.","['Stevens, Alexandra M', 'Miller, Jennifer M', 'Munoz, Jaime O', 'Gaikwad, Amos S', 'Redell, Michele S']","['Stevens AM', 'Miller JM', 'Munoz JO', 'Gaikwad AS', 'Redell MS']","['Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology and.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology and.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology and.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology and.']",['eng'],"['U24 CA114766/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA175026/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA125123/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 AI036211/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'K12 CA090433/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'S10 RR024574/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",['Journal Article'],20170801,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,PMC5727855,,,2018/01/04 06:00,2018/01/04 06:01,['2018/01/04 06:00'],"['2017/04/21 00:00 [received]', '2017/07/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/01/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/04 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1182/bloodadvances.2017007856 [doi]', '2017/007856 [pii]']",epublish,Blood Adv. 2017 Aug 1;1(18):1387-1397. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2017007856. eCollection 2017 Aug 8.,,18,,,,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-7292-2464', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2515-3703']",,"['Conflict-of-interest disclosure: The authors declare no competing financial', 'interests.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the sensitivity and specificity of scoring systems could be enhanced for improved identification of patients with the highest risk. We aimed to identify genomic predictive biomarkers of imatinib response at diagnosis to aid selection of first-line therapy. Targeted amplicon sequencing was performed to determine the germ line variant profile in 517 and 79 patients treated with first-line imatinib and nilotinib, respectively. The Sokal score and ASXL1 rs4911231 and BIM rs686952 variants were independent predictors of early molecular response (MR), major MR, deep MRs (MR(4) and MR(4.5)), and failure-free survival (FFS) with imatinib treatment. In contrast, the ASXL1 and BIM variants did not consistently predict MR or FFS with nilotinib treatment. In the imatinib-treated cohort, neither Sokal or the ASXL1 and BIM variants predicted overall survival (OS) or progression to accelerated phase or blast crisis (AP/BC). The Sokal risk score was combined with the ASXL1 and BIM variants in a classification tree model to predict imatinib response. The model distinguished an ultra-high-risk group, representing 10% of patients, that predicted inferior OS (88% vs 97%; P = .041), progression to AP/BC (12% vs 1%; P = .034), FFS (P < .001), and MRs (P < .001). The ultra-high-risk patients may be candidates for more potent or combination first-line therapy. These data suggest that germ line genetic variation contributes to the heterogeneity of response to imatinib and may contribute to a prognostic risk score that allows early optimization of therapy.","['Marum, Justine E', 'Yeung, David T', 'Purins, Leanne', 'Reynolds, John', 'Parker, Wendy T', 'Stangl, Doris', 'Wang, Paul P S', 'Price, David J', 'Tuke, Jonathan', 'Schreiber, Andreas W', 'Scott, Hamish S', 'Hughes, Timothy P', 'Branford, Susan']","['Marum JE', 'Yeung DT', 'Purins L', 'Reynolds J', 'Parker WT', 'Stangl D', 'Wang PPS', 'Price DJ', 'Tuke J', 'Schreiber AW', 'Scott HS', 'Hughes TP', 'Branford S']","['Department of Genetics and Molecular Pathology, Centre for Cancer Biology, SA Pathology, Adelaide, Australia.', 'Division of Health Sciences, University of South Australia, Adelaide, Australia.', 'Department of Genetics and Molecular Pathology, Centre for Cancer Biology, SA Pathology, Adelaide, Australia.', 'Department of Haematology, SA Pathology, Adelaide, Australia.', 'Cancer Theme, South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute, Adelaide, Australia.', 'School of Medicine, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, Australia.', 'Department of Haematology Cellular Therapies, SA Pathology, Adelaide, Australia.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences, Monash University, Victoria, Australia.', 'Australian Cancer Research Foundation Cancer Genomics Facility, Centre for Cancer Biology, SA Pathology, Adelaide, Australia.', 'Department of Genetics and Molecular Pathology, Centre for Cancer Biology, SA Pathology, Adelaide, Australia.', 'Australian Cancer Research Foundation Cancer Genomics Facility, Centre for Cancer Biology, SA Pathology, Adelaide, Australia.', 'School of Mathematical Sciences, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, Australia.', 'School of Mathematical Sciences, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, Australia.', 'Australian Cancer Research Foundation Cancer Genomics Facility, Centre for Cancer Biology, SA Pathology, Adelaide, Australia.', 'Department of Genetics and Molecular Pathology, Centre for Cancer Biology, SA Pathology, Adelaide, Australia.', 'School of Medicine, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, Australia.', 'Australian Cancer Research Foundation Cancer Genomics Facility, Centre for Cancer Biology, SA Pathology, Adelaide, Australia.', 'School of Pharmacy and Medical Science, University of South Australia, Adelaide, Australia; and.', 'School of Biological Sciences, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, Australia.', 'Department of Haematology, SA Pathology, Adelaide, Australia.', 'Cancer Theme, South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute, Adelaide, Australia.', 'School of Pharmacy and Medical Science, University of South Australia, Adelaide, Australia; and.', 'Department of Genetics and Molecular Pathology, Centre for Cancer Biology, SA Pathology, Adelaide, Australia.', 'School of Medicine, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, Australia.', 'School of Pharmacy and Medical Science, University of South Australia, Adelaide, Australia; and.', 'School of Biological Sciences, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, Australia.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20170731,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,PMC5727850,,,2018/01/04 06:00,2018/01/04 06:01,['2018/01/04 06:00'],"['2017/03/15 00:00 [received]', '2017/06/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/01/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/04 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1182/bloodadvances.2017006825 [doi]', '2017/006825 [pii]']",epublish,Blood Adv. 2017 Jul 31;1(18):1369-1381. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2017006825. eCollection 2017 Aug 8.,,18,,,,,,"['Conflict-of-interest disclosure: D.T.Y. received funding and honoraria from and', 'has served as a consultant on an advisory board of Novartis Oncology and', 'Bristol-Myers Squibb.

In this study, treated s-AML (ts-AML) was defined by: (1) prior diagnosis of myelodysplasia, myeloproliferative neoplasm, or aplastic anemia and (2) at least 1 therapy for that diagnosis. ts-AML was categorized by age (< or >/=60 years), and each cohort assessed for response rates and overall survival (OS) on various treatment regimens. Survival outcomes were compared against other high-risk prognostic subsets. Results showed that complete response and 8-week mortality rates were 32% and 27% in the younger, and 24% and 19% in the older age groups, respectively. There was a significant OS difference within s-AML based on prior treatment of AHD (ie, ts-AML vs s-AML with untreated AHD, 4.2 vs 9.2 months; P < .001). Survival in ts-AML was poor across both cohorts (younger and older, 5 and 4.7 months, respectively). In younger AML, survival was significantly inferior in ts-AML when compared with deletion 5/7, TP53, 3q abnormality, and therapy-related AML groups (median, 5 vs 7.9, 7.8, 7.9, and 11.2 months, respectively; P < .01). Additional adverse karyotype within ts-AML was associated with even worse outcomes (OS range, 1.6-2.8 months). ts-AML represents a very high-risk category, even in younger AML patients. s-AML should be further classified to describe ts-AML, an entity less responsive to currently applied treatment approaches. Future AML trial designs should accommodate ts-AML as a distinct subgroup.","['Boddu, Prajwal', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Ravandi, Farhad', 'Verstovsek, Srdan', 'Jabbour, Elias', 'Borthakur, Gautam', 'Konopleva, Marina', 'Bhalla, Kapil N', 'Daver, Naval', 'DiNardo, Courtney D', 'Benton, Christopher B', 'Takahashi, Koichi', 'Estrov, Zeev', 'Pierce, Sherry R', 'Andreeff, Michael', 'Cortes, Jorge E', 'Kadia, Tapan M']","['Boddu P', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Ravandi F', 'Verstovsek S', 'Jabbour E', 'Borthakur G', 'Konopleva M', 'Bhalla KN', 'Daver N', 'DiNardo CD', 'Benton CB', 'Takahashi K', 'Estrov Z', 'Pierce SR', 'Andreeff M', 'Cortes JE', 'Kadia TM']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.']",['eng'],"['P01 CA049639/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA171338/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA173877/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['Journal Article'],20170719,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,PMC5727976,,,2018/01/04 06:00,2018/01/04 06:01,['2018/01/04 06:00'],"['2017/05/05 00:00 [received]', '2017/06/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/01/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/04 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1182/bloodadvances.2017008227 [doi]', '2017/008227 [pii]']",epublish,Blood Adv. 2017 Jul 19;1(17):1312-1323. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2017008227. eCollection 2017 Jul 25.,,17,,,,,,"['Conflict-of-interest disclosure: The authors declare no competing financial', 'interests.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The lifetime incidence of ATL among HTLV-1-infected individuals is approximately 5%. Although epidemiologic studies have revealed risk factors for ATL, the molecular mechanisms that determine the fates of carriers remain unclear. A better understanding of clonal composition and related longitudinal dynamics would clarify the process of ATL leukemogenesis and provide insights into the mechanisms underlying the proliferation of a malignant clone. Genomic DNA samples and clinical information were obtained from individuals enrolled in the Joint Study for Predisposing Factors for ATL Development, a Japanese prospective cohort study. Forty-seven longitudinal samples from 20 individuals (9 asymptomatic carriers and 11 patients with ATL at enrollment) were subjected to a clonality analysis. A method based on next-generation sequencing was used to characterize clones on the basis of integration sites. Relationships were analyzed among clonal patterns, clone sizes, and clinical status, including ATL onset and progression. Among carriers, those exhibiting an oligoclonal or monoclonal pattern with largely expanded clones subsequently progressed to ATL. All indolent patients who progressed to acute-type ATL exhibited monoclonal expansion. In both situations, the major expanded clone after progression was derived from the largest pre-existing clone. This study has provided the first detailed information regarding the dynamics of HTLV-1-infected T-cell clones and collectively suggests that the clonality of HTLV-1-infected cells could be a useful predictive marker of ATL onset and progression.","['Firouzi, Sanaz', 'Farmanbar, Amir', 'Nakai, Kenta', 'Iwanaga, Masako', 'Uchimaru, Kaoru', 'Utsunomiya, Atae', 'Suzuki, Yutaka', 'Watanabe, Toshiki']","['Firouzi S', 'Farmanbar A', 'Nakai K', 'Iwanaga M', 'Uchimaru K', 'Utsunomiya A', 'Suzuki Y', 'Watanabe T']","['Department of Computational Biology and Medical Sciences, Graduate School of Frontier Sciences, and.', 'Department of Computational Biology and Medical Sciences, Graduate School of Frontier Sciences, and.', 'Laboratory of Functional Analysis in Silico, Human Genome Center, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Computational Biology and Medical Sciences, Graduate School of Frontier Sciences, and.', 'Laboratory of Functional Analysis in Silico, Human Genome Center, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Frontier Life Science, Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki University, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Computational Biology and Medical Sciences, Graduate School of Frontier Sciences, and.', 'Hematology/Oncology, Research Hospital, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Imamura Bun-in Hospital, Kagoshima, Japan; and.', 'Department of Computational Biology and Medical Sciences, Graduate School of Frontier Sciences, and.', 'Department of Computational Biology and Medical Sciences, Graduate School of Frontier Sciences, and.', 'Department of Advanced Medical Innovation, St. Marianna University Graduate School of Medicine, Kanagawa, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20170627,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,PMC5728319,,,2018/01/04 06:00,2018/01/04 06:01,['2018/01/04 06:00'],"['2017/02/21 00:00 [received]', '2017/05/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/01/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/04 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1182/bloodadvances.2017005900 [doi]', '2017/005900 [pii]']",epublish,Blood Adv. 2017 Jun 27;1(15):1195-1205. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2017005900. eCollection 2017 Jun 27.,,15,,,,,,"['Conflict-of-interest disclosure: The authors declare no competing financial', 'interests']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Upon engagement by its ligand, CXCL12, CXCR4 triggers intracellular signaling pathways that control trafficking of cells to tissues where the ligand is expressed, such as the bone marrow (BM). In hematologic cancers, CXCR4-driven homing of malignant cells to the BM protective niche is a key mechanism driving disease and therapy resistance. We developed a humanized CXCR4 immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) antibody (Ab), PF-06747143, which binds to CXCR4 and inhibits CXCL12-mediated signaling pathways, as well as cell migration. In in vivo preclinical studies, PF-06747143 monotherapy rapidly and transiently mobilized cells from the BM into the peripheral blood. In addition, PF-06747143 effectively induced tumor cell death via its Fc constant region-mediated effector function. This Fc-mediated cell killing mechanism not only enhanced antitumor efficacy, but also played a role in reducing the duration of cell mobilization, when compared with an IgG4 version of the Ab, which does not have Fc-effector function. PF-06747143 treatment showed strong antitumor effect in multiple hematologic tumor models including non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and multiple myeloma (MM).

Elevated CD123 expression is part of the diagnostic immunophenotyping of myeloid leukemia, and higher expression is associated with poor prognosis. However, the biological basis of the poorer prognosis is unclear, and may include heightened IL-3 signaling and non-cell autonomous interactions with the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment. We used TF-1 cells expressing different levels of CD123 and found elevated CD123 levels amplified the proliferative response to exogenous IL-3 and maintained viability in reducing IL-3 concentrations. This was associated with stronger activation of STAT5, Akt, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 in vitro. Surprisingly, in vivo e14.5 fetal liver cells transduced with retroviral constructs to express high CD123 failed to engraft in syngeneic recipients. In exploring the underlying mechanism for this, we found that CXCR4, a key molecule involved in LSC/BM interactions, was specifically downregulated in CD123 overexpressing cells in a manner dependent on IL-3 signaling. CXCR4 downregulation was sufficient to alter the chemotactic response of hematopoietic cells to stromal derived factor-1 (SDF-1). Thus, we propose that the overexpression of CD123 in AML LSC dictates their location by altering CXCR4/SDF-1 interaction in the BM, raising the possibility that this mechanism underpins the egress of BM AML LSC and more mature cells into the circulation.","['Wittwer, Nicole L', 'Brumatti, Gabriela', 'Marchant, Ceilidh', 'Sandow, Jarrod J', 'Pudney, Melanie K', 'Dottore, Mara', ""D'Andrea, Richard J"", 'Lopez, Angel F', 'Ekert, Paul G', 'Ramshaw, Hayley S']","['Wittwer NL', 'Brumatti G', 'Marchant C', 'Sandow JJ', 'Pudney MK', 'Dottore M', ""D'Andrea RJ"", 'Lopez AF', 'Ekert PG', 'Ramshaw HS']","['Centre for Cancer Biology, SA Pathology and the University of South Australia, Adelaide, SA, Australia.', 'Walter and Eliza Hall Institute, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', 'Centre for Cancer Biology, SA Pathology and the University of South Australia, Adelaide, SA, Australia.', 'Walter and Eliza Hall Institute, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', 'Centre for Cancer Biology, SA Pathology and the University of South Australia, Adelaide, SA, Australia.', 'Centre for Cancer Biology, SA Pathology and the University of South Australia, Adelaide, SA, Australia.', 'Centre for Cancer Biology, SA Pathology and the University of South Australia, Adelaide, SA, Australia.', 'Faculty of Health Sciences, School of Medicine, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, SA, Australia; and.', 'Centre for Cancer Biology, SA Pathology and the University of South Australia, Adelaide, SA, Australia.', 'Faculty of Health Sciences, School of Medicine, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, SA, Australia; and.', ""Murdoch Children's Research Institute, Parkville, VIC, Australia."", 'Centre for Cancer Biology, SA Pathology and the University of South Australia, Adelaide, SA, Australia.', 'Faculty of Health Sciences, School of Medicine, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, SA, Australia; and.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20170620,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,PMC5728309,,,2018/01/04 06:00,2018/01/04 06:01,['2018/01/04 06:00'],"['2016/11/10 00:00 [received]', '2017/05/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/01/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/04 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1182/bloodadvances.2016002931 [doi]', '2016/002931 [pii]']",epublish,Blood Adv. 2017 Jun 20;1(15):1067-1079. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2016002931. eCollection 2017 Jun 27.,,15,,,,,,"['Conflict-of-interest disclosure: The authors declare no competing financial', 'interests.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CHIP is currently defined as a clonal hematopoietic population carrying somatic point mutations in 1 of the leukemia-associated genes. Patients with t-MNs often present with chromosomal abnormalities in addition to somatic point mutations. It remains unclear whether chromosomal abnormalities can cooccur with point mutations as part of CHIP. Here we report that 3 of 14 patients with t-MNs had low amplitude but detectable chromosome arm-level copy number alterations (CNAs) in the peripheral blood samples that were taken at the time of their primary cancer diagnosis and before exposure to therapy. These CNAs were the same CNAs seen in t-MN bone marrow samples and affected the same allele, suggesting the same clonal origin. These data suggest that not only somatic point mutations but also chromosome arm-level CNAs are detectable as CHIP and preexist before patients' exposure to chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy. These data suggest that screening of both somatic point mutations and CNAs might allow more complete ascertainment of CHIP.","['Takahashi, Koichi', 'Wang, Feng', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Song, Xingzhi', 'Patel, Keyur', 'Neelapu, Sattva', 'Gumbs, Curtis', 'Little, Latasha', 'Tippen, Samantha', 'Thornton, Rebecca', 'DiNardo, Courtney D', 'Ravandi, Farhad', 'Bueso-Ramos, Carlos', 'Zhang, Jianhua', 'Wu, Xifeng', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Futreal, P Andrew']","['Takahashi K', 'Wang F', 'Kantarjian H', 'Song X', 'Patel K', 'Neelapu S', 'Gumbs C', 'Little L', 'Tippen S', 'Thornton R', 'DiNardo CD', 'Ravandi F', 'Bueso-Ramos C', 'Zhang J', 'Wu X', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Futreal PA']","['Department of Leukemia and.', 'Department of Genomic Medicine, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Genomic Medicine, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Leukemia and.', 'Department of Genomic Medicine, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Hematopathology.', 'Department of Lymphoma/Myeloma, and.', 'Department of Genomic Medicine, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Genomic Medicine, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Genomic Medicine, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Genomic Medicine, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Leukemia and.', 'Department of Leukemia and.', 'Department of Hematopathology.', 'Department of Genomic Medicine, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Epidemiology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Leukemia and.', 'Department of Genomic Medicine, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.']",['eng'],['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['Journal Article'],20170619,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,PMC5728325,,,2018/01/04 06:00,2018/01/04 06:01,['2018/01/04 06:00'],"['2017/04/24 00:00 [received]', '2017/05/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/01/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/04 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1182/bloodadvances.2017007922 [doi]', '2017/007922 [pii]']",epublish,Blood Adv. 2017 Jun 19;1(15):1031-1036. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2017007922. eCollection 2017 Jun 27.,,15,,,,['ORCID: 0000-0002-8027-9659'],,"['Conflict-of-interest disclosure: The authors declare no competing financial', 'interests.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Systematic screening strategies can focus on early detection and intervention to prevent ON from progressing to stages associated with pain and functional impairment. These strategies hold promise for reducing ON-associated morbidity without the risk of impairing leukemia control. Herein, we critically reviewed clinical data on pharmacological, nonpharmacological/nonsurgical, and surgical (including cellular) treatment options for ON, which are covered in the literature and/or are conceivable based on the supposed underlying ON pathophysiology. Prevention of ON progression is of paramount importance, and attempts seem to be more effective in early (precollapse) disease status than in late-stage (collapse) ON. Based on the results of ongoing prospective magnetic resonance imaging screening studies, which will hopefully identify those patients with a high risk of ON progression and debilitating sequelae, prospective interventional studies are urgently needed. Although there is still a lack of high-quality studies, based on currently available data, core decompression surgery combined with cellular therapies (eg, employing mesenchymal stem cells) appears most promising for preventing joint infraction in children at high risk of developing late-stage ON.","['Kuhlen, Michaela', 'Kunstreich, Marina', 'Krull, Kathinka', 'Meisel, Roland', 'Borkhardt, Arndt']","['Kuhlen M', 'Kunstreich M', 'Krull K', 'Meisel R', 'Borkhardt A']","['Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology, and Clinical Immunology, Center for Child and Adolescent Health, Medical Faculty, University of Duesseldorf, Duesseldorf, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology, and Clinical Immunology, Center for Child and Adolescent Health, Medical Faculty, University of Duesseldorf, Duesseldorf, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology, and Clinical Immunology, Center for Child and Adolescent Health, Medical Faculty, University of Duesseldorf, Duesseldorf, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology, and Clinical Immunology, Center for Child and Adolescent Health, Medical Faculty, University of Duesseldorf, Duesseldorf, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology, and Clinical Immunology, Center for Child and Adolescent Health, Medical Faculty, University of Duesseldorf, Duesseldorf, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20170613,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,PMC5737600,,,2018/01/04 06:00,2018/01/04 06:01,['2018/01/04 06:00'],"['2017/03/30 00:00 [received]', '2017/05/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/01/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/04 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1182/bloodadvances.2017007286 [doi]', '2017/007286 [pii]']",epublish,Blood Adv. 2017 Jun 13;1(14):981-994. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2017007286. eCollection 2017 Jun 13.,,14,,,,,,"['Conflict-of-interest disclosure: The authors declare no competing financial', 'interests.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Genetically modified mouse models only partially recapitulate the disease phenotype, whereas xenotransplantation of CMML cells in immunocompromised mice has been rarely successful so far. Here, CMML CD34(+) cells sorted from patient bone marrow (BM) or peripheral blood (PB) were injected intravenously into NSG (NOD/LtSz-scid IL2rgammanull) mice and NSG mice engineered to express human granulo-monocyte colony-stimulating factor, stem cell factor, and interleukin-3 (NSGS mice). Fifteen out of 16 patient samples (94%) successfully engrafted into NSG or NSGS or both mouse strains. The expansion of human cells, predominant in the BM, was also observed in the spleen and the PB and was greatly enhanced in mice producing the 3 human cytokines.

Reported toxicities include pleural effusions and pulmonary hypertension, and although the incidence of these events is well described, response to therapy and impact of dose modifications on toxicity has not been comprehensively characterized in a real-world setting. We retrospectively reviewed the incidence of dasatinib adverse events in 212 chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia patients at 17 Australian institutions. Adverse events were reported in 116 patients (55%), most commonly pleural effusions (53 patients, 25%), which was the predominant cause of permanent drug cessation. Age and dose were risk factors for pleural effusion (P < .01 and .047, respectively). Recurrence rates were higher in those who remained on 100 mg compared with those who dose reduced (P = .041); however, recurrence still occurred at 50 mg. Patients who developed pleural effusions were more likely to have achieved MR4.5 after 6 months of dasatinib than those without effusions (P = .008). Pulmonary hypertension occurred in 5% of patients, frequently in association with pleural effusion, and was reversible upon dasatinib cessation in 6 of 7 patients. Dose reductions and temporary cessations had minimal impact on MR rates. Our observations suggest that by using the lowest effective dose in older patients to minimize the effusion risk, dose modification for cytopenias, and care with concomitant antiplatelet therapy, the necessity for permanent dasatinib cessation due to toxicity is likely to be minimal in immunologically competent patients.","['Fox, Lucy C', 'Cummins, Katherine D', 'Costello, Ben', 'Yeung, David', 'Cleary, Rebecca', 'Forsyth, Cecily', 'Tatarczuch, Maciek', 'Burbury, Kate', 'Motorna, Olga', 'Shortt, Jake', 'Fleming, Shaun', 'McQuillan, Andrew', 'Schwarer, Anthony', 'Harrup, Rosemary', 'Holmes, Amy', 'Ratnasingam, Sumita', 'Chan, Kah-Lok', 'Hsu, Wei-Hsun', 'Ashraf, Asma', 'Putt, Faye', 'Grigg, Andrew']","['Fox LC', 'Cummins KD', 'Costello B', 'Yeung D', 'Cleary R', 'Forsyth C', 'Tatarczuch M', 'Burbury K', 'Motorna O', 'Shortt J', 'Fleming S', 'McQuillan A', 'Schwarer A', 'Harrup R', 'Holmes A', 'Ratnasingam S', 'Chan KL', 'Hsu WH', 'Ashraf A', 'Putt F', 'Grigg A']","['Austin Hospital, Melbourne, Australia.', 'Epworth Healthcare, Melbourne, Australia.', 'Austin Hospital, Melbourne, Australia.', 'Alfred Hospital, Melbourne, Australia.', 'Alfred Hospital, Melbourne, Australia.', 'Baker IDI Heart and Diabetes Institute, Melbourne, Australia.', 'Royal Adelaide Hospital, Adelaide, Australia.', 'Princess Alexandra Hospital, Brisbane, Australia.', 'Gosford Hospital, Gosford, Australia.', 'Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Australia.', 'Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Australia.', 'Monash Health, Clayton, Melbourne, Australia.', 'Monash Health, Clayton, Melbourne, Australia.', 'School of Clinical Sciences at Monash Health, Monash University, Clayton, Melbourne, Australia.', 'Alfred Hospital, Melbourne, Australia.', 'School of Clinical Sciences at Monash Health, Monash University, Clayton, Melbourne, Australia.', 'Hollywood Medical Centre, Perth, Australia.', 'Austin Hospital, Melbourne, Australia.', 'Epworth Healthcare, Melbourne, Australia.', 'Box Hill Hospital, Melbourne, Australia.', 'Royal Hobart Hospital, Hobart, Australia.', 'Canberra Hospital, Canberra, Australia.', 'Royal Melbourne Hospital, Melbourne, Australia.', ""St Vincent's Hospital, Melbourne, Australia."", 'Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Sydney, Australia; and.', 'Calvary Mater Hospital, Newcastle, Australia.', 'Austin Hospital, Melbourne, Australia.', 'Austin Hospital, Melbourne, Australia.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20170515,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,PMC5727806,,,2018/01/04 06:00,2018/01/04 06:01,['2018/01/04 06:00'],"['2016/12/18 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/01/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/04 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1182/bloodadvances.2016003889 [doi]', '2016/003889 [pii]']",epublish,Blood Adv. 2017 May 15;1(13):802-811. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2016003889. eCollection 2017 May 23.,,13,,,,,,"['Conflict-of-interest disclosure: J.S. and D.Y. have received honoraria from', 'Novartis and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS) and research funding from BMS and', 'participated in Advisory Boards for Novartis.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play an important role in normal development and pathologies. Here, we examined the expression of 738 miRNA species in 41 newly diagnosed pediatric T-ALLs and in human thymus-derived cells. We found that expression of 2 clustered miRNAs, miR-125b/99a, peaks in primitive T cells and is upregulated in the T leukemia homeobox 3 (TLX3)-positive subtype of T-ALL. Using loss- and gain-of-function approaches, we established functional relationships between TLX3 and miR-125b. Both TLX3 and miR-125b support in vitro cell growth and in vivo invasiveness of T-ALL. Besides, ectopic expression of TLX3 or miR-125b in human hematopoietic progenitor cells enhances production of T-cell progenitors and favors their accumulation at immature stages of T-cell development resembling the differentiation arrest observed in TLX3 T-ALL. Ectopic miR-125b also remarkably accelerated leukemia in a xenograft model, suggesting that miR125b is an important mediator of the TLX3-mediated transformation program that takes place in immature T-cell progenitors. Mechanistically, TLX3-mediated activation of miR-125b may impact T-cell differentiation in part via repression of Ets1 and CBFbeta genes, 2 regulators of T-lineage. Finally, we established that TLX3 directly regulates miR-125b production through binding and transactivation of LINC00478, a long noncoding RNA gene, which is the host of miR-99a/Let-7c/miR-125b. Altogether, our results reveal an original functional link between TLX3 and oncogenic miR-125b in T-ALL development.","['Renou, Laurent', 'Boelle, Pierre-Yves', 'Deswarte, Caroline', 'Spicuglia, Salvatore', 'Benyoucef, Aissa', 'Calvo, Julien', 'Uzan, Benjamin', 'Belhocine, Mohamed', 'Cieslak, Agata', 'Landman-Parker, Judith', 'Baruchel, Andre', 'Asnafi, Vahid', 'Pflumio, Francoise', 'Ballerini, Paola', 'Naguibneva, Irina']","['Renou L', 'Boelle PY', 'Deswarte C', 'Spicuglia S', 'Benyoucef A', 'Calvo J', 'Uzan B', 'Belhocine M', 'Cieslak A', 'Landman-Parker J', 'Baruchel A', 'Asnafi V', 'Pflumio F', 'Ballerini P', 'Naguibneva I']","[""Commissariat a l'Energie Atomique et aux Energies Alternatives, Institut de Radiobiologie Cellulaire et Moleculaire, Laboratoire des Cellules Souches Hematopoietiques et Leucemiques, Equipe Labellisee Ligue Contre le Cancer, Unite Mixte de Recherche (UMR) 967 Stabilite genomique, cellules souches et radiations, Fontenay-aux-Roses, France."", 'INSERM U967, Fontenay-aux-Roses, France.', 'Universite Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cite, UMR 967, Fontenay-aux-Roses, France.', 'Universite Paris-Sud, UMR 967, Fontenay-aux-Roses, France.', ""Departement d'Informatique Medicale, Universite Pierre et Marie Curie, Paris VI, Paris, France."", ""Service d'Hematologie Pediatrique, Hopital A.

However, patients develop resistance, with poor outcomes and no established treatment options. Mutations in BTK and PLCG2 have emerged as main mechanisms of drug resistance, but not all patients carry these mutations. Further understanding of mechanisms of resistance is urgently needed and will support rational development of new therapeutic strategies. To that end, we characterized the genomic profiles of serial samples from 9 patients with ibrutinib-relapsed disease, including 6 who had Richter transformation. Mutations, indels, copy-number aberrations, and loss of heterozygosity were assessed using next-generation sequencing and single-nucleotide polymorphism array. We found that 18p deletion (del(18p)), together with del(17p)/TP53 mutations, was present in 5 of 9 patients before ibrutinib therapy. In addition to BTK(C481) , we identified BTK(T316A) , a structurally novel mutation located in the SH2 domain of BTK. Minor BTK clones with low allele frequencies were captured in addition to major BTK clones. Although TP53 loss predisposes patients for relapse, clone size of TP53 loss may diminish during disease progression while mutant BTK clone expands. In patients who had Richter transformation, we found that the transformed cells were clonal descendants of circulating leukemia cells but continued to undergo evolution and drifts. Surprisingly, transformed lymphoma cells in tissue may acquire a different BTK mutation from that in the CLL leukemia cells.

No consensus exists on selection criteria over several haploidentical donors. We evaluated the impact of donor-recipient antigenic and allelic HLA-A, -B, -C, and -DRB1 mismatches on mismatched haplotype on outcomes of 509 unmanipulated haplo-HSCTs performed for acute leukemia under a PTCy (N = 313) or ATG (N = 196) regimen. An antigenic but not allelic mismatch at the HLA-DRB1 locus was an independent risk factor for grade >/=2 aGVHD in PTCy (hazard ratio [HR], 2.0; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2-4.0; P = .02) but not in ATG regimens (HR, 1.3; 95% CI, 0.4-3.4; P = .6). Moreover, the hazards of aGVHD were significantly associated with other factors influencing alloreactivity, including peripheral blood as stem cell source (HR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.4-3; P < .01), reduced-intensity conditioning (HR, 0.6; 95% CI, 0.4-0.9; P = .04), and female donors (HR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1-3.2; P = .05), in PTCy but not ATG regimens. No significant associations were found between cumulative number of HLA mismatches and GVHD, or between HLA-matching status and other study end points including transplant-related mortality, disease-free survival, and relapse. Based on these data, the role of HLA mismatching on unshared haplotype appears not to be sufficiently prominent to justify its consideration in haploidentical donor selection. However, the role of HLA matching in haploidentical HSCT might be modulated by GVHD prophylaxis, calling for further investigations in this increasingly relevant field.","['Lorentino, Francesca', 'Labopin, Myriam', 'Fleischhauer, Katharina', 'Ciceri, Fabio', 'Mueller, Carlheinz R', 'Ruggeri, Annalisa', 'Shimoni, Avichai', 'Bornhauser, Martin', 'Bacigalupo, Andrea', 'Gulbas, Zafer', 'Koc, Yener', 'Arcese, William', 'Bruno, Benedetto', 'Tischer, Johanna', 'Blaise, Didier', 'Messina, Giuseppe', 'Beelen, Dietrich W', 'Nagler, Arnon', 'Mohty, Mohamad']","['Lorentino F', 'Labopin M', 'Fleischhauer K', 'Ciceri F', 'Mueller CR', 'Ruggeri A', 'Shimoni A', 'Bornhauser M', 'Bacigalupo A', 'Gulbas Z', 'Koc Y', 'Arcese W', 'Bruno B', 'Tischer J', 'Blaise D', 'Messina G', 'Beelen DW', 'Nagler A', 'Mohty M']","['Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplant Unit, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.', 'Hematologie Clinique et Therapie Cellulaire, Hopital Saint-Antoine, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Paris, France.', 'Universite Pierre et Marie Curie, Paris, France.', 'Unite de Recherche Mixte en Sante (UMR_S) 938, INSERM, Paris, France.', 'Institute for Experimental Cellular Therapy, University Hospital Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplant Unit, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.', 'German National Bone Marrow Donor Registry, Ulm, Germany.', 'Hematologie Clinique et Therapie Cellulaire, Hopital Saint-Antoine, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Paris, France.', 'Universite Pierre et Marie Curie, Paris, France.', 'Unite de Recherche Mixte en Sante (UMR_S) 938, INSERM, Paris, France.', 'Hematology Division, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel Hashomer, Israel.', 'Medizinische Klinik Und Poliklinik I, Universitatsklinikum Carl Gustav Carus Der Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Division of Hematology, Catholic University of the Sacred Heart, Rome, Italy.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Department, Anadolu Medical Center Hospital, Kocaeli, Turkey.', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Unit, Medical Park Hospital, Antalya, Turkey.', 'Stem Cell Transplant Unit, Fondazione Policlinico Tor Vergata, Tor Vergata University, Rome, Italy.', 'Dipartimento di Ematologia, Presidio Molinette, Universita di Torino, Turin, Italy.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, Grosshadern Clinic, University Hospital of Munich (Ludwig Maximilians University), Munich, Germany.', 'Programme de Transplantation et Therapie Cellulaire, Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie de Marseille, Institut Paoli Calmettes, Marseille, France.', 'Hematology and Stem Transplantation Unit, Onco-Hematology Department, Bianchi Melacrino Morelli Hospital Agency, Reggio Calabria, Italy; and.', 'Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation, University Hospital, Essen, Germany.', 'Universite Pierre et Marie Curie, Paris, France.', 'Hematology Division, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel Hashomer, Israel.', 'Hematologie Clinique et Therapie Cellulaire, Hopital Saint-Antoine, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Paris, France.', 'Universite Pierre et Marie Curie, Paris, France.', 'Unite de Recherche Mixte en Sante (UMR_S) 938, INSERM, Paris, France.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20170421,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,PMC5727822,,,2018/01/04 06:00,2018/01/04 06:01,['2018/01/04 06:00'],"['2017/03/05 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/01/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/04 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1182/bloodadvances.2017006429 [doi]', '2017/006429 [pii]']",epublish,Blood Adv. 2017 Apr 21;1(11):669-680. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2017006429. eCollection 2017 Apr 25.,,11,,,,['ORCID: 0000-0002-3596-9810'],,"['Conflict-of-interest disclosure: The authors declare no competing financial', 'interests.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we show that the CLL lymph node niche is characterized by overexpression and activation of HIF-1alpha, which increases adenosine generation and signaling, affecting tumor and host cellular responses. Hypoxia in CLL lymphocytes modifies central metabolic pathways, protects against drug-driven apoptosis, and induces interleukin 10 (IL-10) production. In myeloid cells, it forces monocyte differentiation to macrophages expressing IRF4, IDO, CD163, and CD206, hallmarks of the M2 phenotype, which promotes tumor progression. It also induces IL-6 production and enhances nurturing properties. Low oxygen levels decrease T-cell proliferation, promote glycolysis, and cause the appearance of a population of PD-1(+) and IL-10-secreting T cells. Blockade of the A2A adenosine receptor counteracts these effects on all cell populations, making leukemic cells more susceptible to pharmacological agents while restoring immune competence and T-cell proliferation. Together, these results indicate that adenosine signaling through the A2A receptor mediates part of the effects of hypoxia. They also suggest that therapeutic strategies to inhibit the adenosinergic axis may be useful adjuncts to chemotherapy or tyrosine kinase inhibitors in the treatment of CLL patients.","['Serra, Sara', 'Vaisitti, Tiziana', 'Audrito, Valentina', 'Bologna, Cinzia', 'Buonincontri, Roberta', 'Chen, Shih-Shih', 'Arruga, Francesca', 'Brusa, Davide', 'Coscia, Marta', 'Jaksic, Ozren', 'Inghirami, Giorgio', 'Rossi, Davide', 'Furman, Richard R', 'Robson, Simon C', 'Gaidano, Gianluca', 'Chiorazzi, Nicholas', 'Deaglio, Silvia']","['Serra S', 'Vaisitti T', 'Audrito V', 'Bologna C', 'Buonincontri R', 'Chen SS', 'Arruga F', 'Brusa D', 'Coscia M', 'Jaksic O', 'Inghirami G', 'Rossi D', 'Furman RR', 'Robson SC', 'Gaidano G', 'Chiorazzi N', 'Deaglio S']","['Department of Medical Sciences, University of Turin, Turin, Italy.', 'Human Genetics Foundation, Turin, Italy.', 'Department of Medical Sciences, University of Turin, Turin, Italy.', 'Human Genetics Foundation, Turin, Italy.', 'Department of Medical Sciences, University of Turin, Turin, Italy.', 'Human Genetics Foundation, Turin, Italy.', 'Department of Medical Sciences, University of Turin, Turin, Italy.', 'Human Genetics Foundation, Turin, Italy.', 'Department of Medical Sciences, University of Turin, Turin, Italy.', 'Human Genetics Foundation, Turin, Italy.', 'The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, Northwell Health, Manhasset, NY.', 'Department of Medical Sciences, University of Turin, Turin, Italy.', 'Human Genetics Foundation, Turin, Italy.', 'Human Genetics Foundation, Turin, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology, Azienda Ospedaliera Citta della Salute e della Scienza, Turin, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology, Dubrava University Hospital, Zagreb, Croatia.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY.', 'Department of Molecular Biotechnology and Health Sciences, University of Turin, Turin, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Translational Medicine, University of Eastern Piedmont, Novara, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY; and.', 'Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard University, Boston, MA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Translational Medicine, University of Eastern Piedmont, Novara, Italy.', 'The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, Northwell Health, Manhasset, NY.', 'Department of Medical Sciences, University of Turin, Turin, Italy.', 'Human Genetics Foundation, Turin, Italy.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20161122,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,PMC5744057,,,2016/11/22 00:00,2016/11/22 00:01,['2018/01/04 06:00'],"['2016/08/30 00:00 [received]', '2016/09/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/11/22 00:00 [pubmed]', '2016/11/22 00:01 [medline]']","['10.1182/bloodadvances.2016000984 [doi]', '2016/000984 [pii]']",epublish,Blood Adv. 2016 Nov 22;1(1):47-61. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2016000984. eCollection 2016 Nov 29.,,1,,,,,,"['Conflict-of-interest disclosure: The authors declare that there is no conflict of', 'interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A myeloid neoplasm-relevant 27-gene panel was used for next-generation sequencing of bone marrow or whole blood DNA and conventional tools were used for analysis. ""Adverse variants/mutations"" were identified by age-adjusted multivariable analysis of impact on overall, leukemia-free, or myelofibrosis-free survival. Fifty-three percent of 133 Mayo Clinic patients with PV and 53% of 183 with ET harbored 1 or more sequence variants/mutations other than JAK2/CALR/MPL; the most frequent were TET2 and ASXL1. ""Adverse variants/mutations"" in PV included ASXL1, SRSF2, and IDH2 and in ET SH2B3, SF3B1, U2AF1, TP53, IDH2, and EZH2; combined prevalence was 15% and 15%, respectively. Adverse variants/mutations were associated with inferior survival in both PV (median, 7.7 vs 16.9 years) and ET (median, 9 vs 22 years) and the effect was independent of conventional prognostic models with respective hazard ratio (95% confidence interval) of 2.8 (1.5-5.1) and 2.6 (1.4-4.8); these observations were validated in 215 Italian patients with PV and 174 with ET. In both Mayo Clinic and Italian cohorts, leukemic or fibrotic progression was also predicted by adverse variants/mutations. Number of mutations did not provide additional prognostic information.

TIGIT is a recently identified inhibitory receptor on T cells and natural killer (NK) cells. In this study, we examined TIGIT expression on T cell subsets from CLL patients. While we did not observe any differences in TIGIT expression in CD8+ T cells of healthy controls and CLL cells, we found an enrichment of TIGIT+ T cells in the CD4+ T cell compartment in CLL. Intriguingly, CLL patients with an advanced disease stage displayed elevated numbers of CD4+ TIGIT+ T cells compared to low risk patients. Autologous CLL-T cell co-culture assays revealed that depleting CD4+ TIGIT+ expressing T cells from co-cultures significantly decreased CLL viability. Accordingly, a supportive effect of TIGIT+CD4+ T cells on CLL cells in vitro could be recapitulated by blocking the interaction of TIGIT with its ligands using TIGIT-Fc molecules, which also impeded the T cell specific production of CLL-prosurvival cytokines. Our data reveal that TIGIT+CD4+T cells provide a supportive microenvironment for CLL cells, representing a potential therapeutic target for CLL treatment.","['Catakovic, Kemal', 'Gassner, Franz

The aim of this study is to retrospectively evaluate B-mode ultrasound (US) and elastography (ES) findings of breast involvement by hematologic malignancies with clinical outcomes. Materials and Methods: All core-needle biopsy results that were performed at our tertiary breast center from January 2013 to September 2016 were searched. Our search revealed 9 patients with breast involvement either by leukemia or lymphoma. All patients were examined using B-mode US and ES. US and ES findings were analyzed with the consensus of two radiologists, and clinical outcomes were noted. Results: The mean age of the study population was 41.6 years (range, 20-83 years). Two patients showed diffuse hypoechoic parenchymal infiltration. The elasticity assessments of these lesions were soft and intermediate. The remaining 7 patients had mass lesions. The elasticity assessment of these masses according to Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System US was as follows: Soft (n = 1), intermediate (n = 4), high (n = 2). Conclusions: It is important to consider that hematologic malignancies may appear as soft or intermediate lesions on ES. Patients' history and clinical background should help us to consider breast involvement. In addition, the clinical outcomes may not be related with elasticity assessments.","['Aslan, Hulya', 'Pourbagher, Aysin']","['Aslan H', 'Pourbagher A']","['Department of Radiology, Faculty of Medicine, Baskent University, Adana Dr. Turgut Noyan Teaching and Medical Research Center, Dadaloglu Mh, Adana, Turkey.', 'Department of Radiology, Faculty of Medicine, Baskent University, Adana Dr. Turgut Noyan Teaching and Medical Research Center, Dadaloglu Mh, Adana, Turkey.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20171130,United States,J Clin Imaging Sci,Journal of clinical imaging science,101564708,PMC5747218,['NOTNLM'],"['Breast', 'elastography', 'leukemia', 'lymphoma', 'ultrasound']",2018/01/04 06:00,2018/01/04 06:01,['2018/01/04 06:00'],"['2017/08/10 00:00 [received]', '2017/10/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/01/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/04 06:01 [medline]']","['10.4103/jcis.JCIS_65_17 [doi]', 'JCIS-7-42 [pii]']",epublish,J Clin Imaging Sci. 2017 Nov 30;7:42. doi: 10.4103/jcis.JCIS_65_17. eCollection 2017.,,,,,,,,['There are no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Materials and Methods: In this Ethics Approved Study, databases of the Long Term Follow-Up Clinic at Sydney Children's Hospital and the Prince of Wales Cancer Centre were audited for patients who received radiotherapy to the head as a child, and subsequently developed an intracranial meningioma. Features noted were, initial diagnosis, extent of prior treatment, dose, latency to diagnosis, subsequent treatment, and outcome. Results: There were 18 patients with an equal gender mix of males/females (9), the majority of patients being treated with whole brain radiotherapy for leukaemia prophylaxis. 6 patients had radiotherapy, 4 had follow-up out to 17 years with no further adverse event, and control of the meningioma. Conclusion: Surgery may still be the treatment of choice, however where appropriate radiotherapy can be considered, with good prospect of benefit to the patient.","['Smee, Robert I']",['Smee RI'],"['Department of Radiation Oncology, The Prince of Wales Cancer Centre, High St, Randwick, New South Wales, Australia.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,J Radiosurg SBRT,Journal of radiosurgery and SBRT,101565296,PMC5675471,['NOTNLM'],"['Paediatric tumours', 'SRS/SIMRT', 'latency period', 'radiation-associated meningiomas', 'radiotherapy']",2011/01/01 00:00,2011/01/01 00:01,['2018/01/04 06:00'],"['2018/01/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/01 00:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,J Radiosurg SBRT. 2011;1(2):141-145.,,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, single-cell response profiles and primary human tissue comprise a response platform used to discover novel microbial metabolites with cell-type-selective effector properties in untargeted metabolomic inventories. Metabolites display diverse effector mechanisms, including targeting protein synthesis, cell cycle status, DNA damage repair, necrosis, apoptosis, or phosphoprotein signaling. Arrayed metabolites are tested against acute myeloid leukemia patient bone marrow and molecules that specifically targeted blast cells or nonleukemic immune cell subsets within the same tissue biopsy are revealed. Cell-targeting polyketides are identified in extracts from biosynthetically prolific bacteria, including a previously unreported leukemia blast-targeting anthracycline and a polyene macrolactam that alternates between targeting blasts or nonmalignant cells by way of light-triggered photochemical isomerization. High-resolution cell profiling with mass cytometry confirms response mechanisms and is used to validate initial observations.","['Earl, David C', 'Ferrell, P Brent Jr', 'Leelatian, Nalin', 'Froese, Jordan T', 'Reisman, Benjamin J', 'Irish, Jonathan M', 'Bachmann, Brian O']","['Earl DC', 'Ferrell PB Jr', 'Leelatian N', 'Froese JT', 'Reisman BJ', 'Irish JM', 'Bachmann BO']","['Department of Chemistry, Vanderbilt University, 7330 Stevenson Center, Station B 351822, Nashville, TN, 37235, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, 1161 21st Avenue South, D-3100 Medical Center North, Nashville, TN, 37232, USA.', 'Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, Vanderbilt University, 465 21st Avenue South, Nashville, TN, 37232, USA.', 'Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, 2220 Pierce Avenue, Nashville, TN, 37232, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Microbiology and Immunology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, 1161 21st Avenue South, D-2220 Medical Center North, Nashville, TN, 37232, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry, Vanderbilt University, 7330 Stevenson Center, Station B 351822, Nashville, TN, 37235, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry, Vanderbilt University, 7330 Stevenson Center, Station B 351822, Nashville, TN, 37235, USA.', 'Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, Vanderbilt University, 465 21st Avenue South, Nashville, TN, 37232, USA. jonathan.irish@vanderbilt.edu.', 'Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, 2220 Pierce Avenue, Nashville, TN, 37232, USA. jonathan.irish@vanderbilt.edu.', 'Department of Pathology, Microbiology and Immunology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, 1161 21st Avenue South, D-2220 Medical Center North, Nashville, TN, 37232, USA. jonathan.irish@vanderbilt.edu.', 'Department of Chemistry, Vanderbilt University, 7330 Stevenson Center, Station B 351822, Nashville, TN, 37235, USA. brian.bachmann@vanderbilt.edu.']",['eng'],"['L30 CA179768/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K12 CA090625/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'L30 HL139435/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM007347/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA068485/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM065086/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM092218/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'K23 HL138291/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R00 CA143231/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180102,England,Nat Commun,Nature communications,101528555,PMC5750220,,,2018/01/04 06:00,2018/02/03 06:00,['2018/01/04 06:00'],"['2017/04/13 00:00 [received]', '2017/12/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/01/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/03 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41467-017-02470-8 [doi]', '10.1038/s41467-017-02470-8 [pii]']",epublish,Nat Commun. 2018 Jan 2;9(1):39. doi: 10.1038/s41467-017-02470-8.,20180202,1,['0 (Cell Extracts)'],IM,"['Aged', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cell Extracts', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'DNA Damage', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry/methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/pathology', 'Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Metabolome', 'Metabolomics/*methods', 'Monocytes/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Streptomyces/chemistry', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Young Adult']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9428-8866'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report here that human lymphocytes [B cells, T cells, natural killer (NK) cells], monocytes, and neutrophils derived from healthy blood donors, as well as B cells from chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients, rapidly eject mtDNA as web filament structures upon recognition of CpG and non-CpG oligodeoxynucleotides of class C. The release was quenched by ZnCl2, independent of cell death (apoptosis, necrosis, necroptosis, autophagy), and continued in the presence of TLR9 signaling inhibitors. B-cell mtDNA webs were distinct from neutrophil extracellular traps concerning structure, reactive oxygen species (ROS) dependence, and were devoid of antibacterial proteins. mtDNA webs acted as rapid (within minutes) messengers, priming antiviral type I IFN production. In summary, our findings point at a previously unrecognized role for lymphocytes in antimicrobial defense, utilizing mtDNA webs as signals in synergy with cytokines and natural antibodies, and cast light on the interplay between mitochondria and the immune system.","['Ingelsson, Bjorn', 'Soderberg, Daniel', 'Strid, Tobias', 'Soderberg, Anita', 'Bergh, Ann-Charlotte', 'Loitto, Vesa', 'Lotfi, Kourosh', 'Segelmark, Marten', 'Spyrou, Giannis', 'Rosen, Anders']","['Ingelsson B', 'Soderberg D', 'Strid T', 'Soderberg A', 'Bergh AC', 'Loitto V', 'Lotfi K', 'Segelmark M', 'Spyrou G', 'Rosen A']","['Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Linkoping University, SE-581 85 Linkoping, Sweden.', 'Department of Medical and Health Sciences, Linkoping University, SE-581 85 Linkoping, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Linkoping University, SE-581 85 Linkoping, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Linkoping University, SE-581 85 Linkoping, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Linkoping University, SE-581 85 Linkoping, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Linkoping University, SE-581 85 Linkoping, Sweden.', 'Department of Medical and Health Sciences, Linkoping University, SE-581 85 Linkoping, Sweden.', 'Department of Hematology, Linkoping University, SE-581 85 Linkoping, Sweden.', 'Department of Medical and Health Sciences, Linkoping University, SE-581 85 Linkoping, Sweden.', 'Department of Nephrology, Linkoping University, SE-581 85 Linkoping, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Linkoping University, SE-581 85 Linkoping, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Linkoping University, SE-581 85 Linkoping, Sweden; anders.rosen@liu.se.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180102,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,PMC5776968,['NOTNLM'],"['*CpG-C', '*DAMP', '*immune DNA sensing', '*lymphocyte signaling', '*mitochondrial DNA release']",2018/01/04 06:00,2018/07/18 06:00,['2018/01/04 06:00'],"['2018/01/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/07/18 06:00 [medline]', '2018/01/04 06:00 [entrez]']","['1711950115 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1711950115 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2018 Jan 16;115(3):E478-E487. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1711950115.

Here, we analyzed our CLL patient cohort for second skin (pre)malignancies and found a significantly lower incidence of skin cancer in the patients showing immune responses to CLL-associated antigens. Surprisingly, CLL-associated antigen-specific immune responses did not associate with clinical characteristics including leukocyte, neutrophil, and thrombocyte count, hemoglobin, immunoglobulin levels, or CD8(+) and CD4(+) T-cell immune status.

While treatment-naive BL has been characterized, the genomic landscape of BL at the time of relapse (rBL) has never been reported. Here, we present a genomic characterization of two rBL patients. The diagnostic samples had mutations common in BL, including MYC and CCND3. Additional mutations were detected at relapse, affecting important pathways such as NFkappaB (IKBKB) and MEK/ERK (NRAS) signaling, glutamine metabolism (SIRT4), and RNA processing (ZFP36L2). Genes implicated in drug resistance were also mutated at relapse (TP53, BAX, ALDH3A1, APAF1, FANCI). This concurrent genomic profiling of samples obtained at diagnosis and relapse has revealed mutations not previously reported in this disease. The patient-derived cell lines will be made available and, along with their detailed genetics, will be a valuable resource to examine the role of specific mutations in therapeutic resistance.","['Wever, Claudia M', 'Geoffrion, Dominique', 'Grande, Bruno M', 'Yu, Stephen', 'Alcaide, Miguel', 'Lemaire, Maryse', 'Riazalhosseini, Yasser', 'Hebert, Josee', 'Gavino, Christina', 'Vinh, Donald C', 'Petrogiannis-Haliotis, Tina', 'Dmitrienko, Svetlana', 'Mann, Koren K', 'Morin, Ryan D', 'Johnson, Nathalie A']","['Wever CM', 'Geoffrion D', 'Grande BM', 'Yu S', 'Alcaide M', 'Lemaire M', 'Riazalhosseini Y', 'Hebert J', 'Gavino C', 'Vinh DC', 'Petrogiannis-Haliotis T', 'Dmitrienko S', 'Mann KK', 'Morin RD', 'Johnson NA']","['a Department of Medicine , McGill University, Lady Davis Institute, Jewish General Hospital , Montreal , Canada.', 'b Lady Davis Institute, Jewish General Hospital , Montreal , Canada.', 'b Lady Davis Institute, Jewish General Hospital , Montreal , Canada.', 'c Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry , Simon Fraser University , Burnaby , Canada.', 'd Genome Sciences Centre, BC Cancer Agency , Vancouver , Canada.', 'c Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry , Simon Fraser University , Burnaby , Canada.', 'c Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry , Simon Fraser University , Burnaby , Canada.', 'b Lady Davis Institute, Jewish General Hospital , Montreal , Canada.', 'e Department of Human Genetics , McGill University , Montreal , Canada.', 'f McGill University and Genome Quebec Innovation Centre , Montreal , Canada.', 'g Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine , Universite de Montreal , Montreal , Canada.', 'h Research Centre and Division of Hematology-Oncology Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital , The Quebec Leukemia Cell Bank , Montreal , Canada.', 'i Infectious Disease Susceptibility Program (Research Institute-McGill University Health Centre) , Montreal , Canada.', 'j Department of Medicine , Medical Microbiology and Human Genetics (McGill University Health Centre) , Montreal , Canada.', 'i Infectious Disease Susceptibility Program (Research Institute-McGill University Health Centre) , Montreal , Canada.', 'j Department of Medicine , Medical Microbiology and Human Genetics (McGill University Health Centre) , Montreal , Canada.', 'k Department of Pathology , Jewish General Hospital , Montreal , Canada.', 'k Department of Pathology , Jewish General Hospital , Montreal , Canada.', 'a Department of Medicine , McGill University, Lady Davis Institute, Jewish General Hospital , Montreal , Canada.', 'b Lady Davis Institute, Jewish General Hospital , Montreal , Canada.', 'c Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry , Simon Fraser University , Burnaby , Canada.', 'd Genome Sciences Centre, BC Cancer Agency , Vancouver , Canada.', 'a Department of Medicine , McGill University, Lady Davis Institute, Jewish General Hospital , Montreal , Canada.', 'b Lady Davis Institute, Jewish General Hospital , Montreal , Canada.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180103,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Lymphoma and Hodgkin disease', '*cell cycle and apoptosis changes', '*drug resistance', '*lymphocytes', '*molecular genetics']",2018/01/04 06:00,2019/03/19 06:00,['2018/01/04 06:00'],"['2018/01/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/19 06:00 [medline]', '2018/01/04 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10428194.2017.1413186 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2018 Sep;59(9):2159-2174. doi: 10.1080/10428194.2017.1413186.

The described method allows identifying LYS with a 44.6 femtomolar limit of detection, using sample volume as low as 1muL and detection time in the range of 10min. We used luminol to generate the chemiluminescence and demonstrated that the compartmentalization of LYS in droplets also comprising gold nanoparticles provided enhanced luminescence. We functionalized the gold nanoparticles with a thiolated aptamer to achieve the required selectivity that allowed us to detect LYS in human serum.","['Giuffrida, Maria Chiara', 'Cigliana, Giovanni', 'Spoto, Giuseppe']","['Giuffrida MC', 'Cigliana G', 'Spoto G']","['Consorzio Interuniversitario ""Istituto Nazionale Biostrutture e Biosistemi"", c/o Dipartimento di Scienze Chimiche, Universita di Catania, Viale Andrea Doria 6, Catania, Italy.', 'Clinical Pathology Unit, Regina Elena National Cancer Institute, Via Chianesi, Roma, Italy.', 'Consorzio Interuniversitario ""Istituto Nazionale Biostrutture e Biosistemi"", c/o Dipartimento di Scienze Chimiche, Universita di Catania, Viale Andrea Doria 6, Catania, Italy; Dipartimento di Scienze Chimiche, Universita di Catania, Viale Andrea Doria 6, I-95125 Catania, Italy.

These NanoLIF particles are designed to prolong the neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory actions of LIF in future preclinical studies of ischemic stroke. METHODS: LIF was packaged in nanoparticles made of poly(ethylene glycol)-poly(lactic acid) (PEG-PLA) polymer to form LIF-loaded nanoparticles (NanoLIF). The surface of NanoLIF was also modified with the CD11b antibody (CD11b-NanoLIF) targeting activated peripheral macrophages to increase cytokine delivery to inflammatory macrophages. ELISA was used to quantify bioactive cytokine inside and releasing from NanoLIF. NanoLIF biological activity was measured using the M1 murine leukemia cell proliferation assay. RESULTS: NanoLIF and CD11b-NanoLIF had diameters of approximately 30 nm, neutral surface charge, and physicochemical stability retaining biological activity of the cytokine during incubation at 25 degrees C for 12 h. NanoLIF particles released LIF relatively fast from 0 to 6 h after incubation at 37 degrees C followed by slow release from 24 to 72 h according to a two-phase exponential decay model. NanoLIF and CD11b-NanoLIF significantly decreased M1 cell proliferation over 72 h compared to free LIF. CONCLUSIONS: NanoLIF and CD11b-NanoLIF preserved the metabolic stability and biological activity of LIF in vitro. These results are promising to improve the therapeutic potential of LIF in treating neurodegenerative and inflammatory diseases.","['Davis, Stephanie M', 'Reichel, Derek', 'Bae, Younsoo', 'Pennypacker, Keith R']","['Davis SM', 'Reichel D', 'Bae Y', 'Pennypacker KR']","['Department of Neurology, College of Medicine, University of Kentucky, 741 South Limestone, Lexington, Kentucky, 40536, USA.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, University of Kentucky, 789 South Limestone, Lexington, Kentucky, 40536, USA.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, University of Kentucky, 789 South Limestone, Lexington, Kentucky, 40536, USA.', 'Department of Neurology, College of Medicine, University of Kentucky, 741 South Limestone, Lexington, Kentucky, 40536, USA. keith.pennypacker@uky.edu.']",['eng'],"['R01 NS091146/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', '5R01NS091146-03/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20180102,United States,Pharm Res,Pharmaceutical research,8406521,PMC6265655,['NOTNLM'],"['*cytokine delivery', '*inflammation', '*macrophages', '*neurodegeneration', '*stroke']",2018/01/03 06:00,2018/11/13 06:00,['2018/01/03 06:00'],"['2017/08/02 00:00 [received]', '2017/10/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/01/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/11/13 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s11095-017-2282-4 [doi]', '10.1007/s11095-017-2282-4 [pii]']",epublish,Pharm Res. 2018 Jan 2;35(1):6. doi: 10.1007/s11095-017-2282-4.,20181112,1,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents)', '0 (CD11b Antigen)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Drug Carriers)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (monomethoxypolyethyleneglycol-polylactide block copolymer)', '3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents/*pharmacology', 'Brain Ischemia/drug therapy', 'CD11b Antigen/chemistry/immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytokines/*metabolism', 'Drug Carriers/chemistry', 'Drug Liberation', 'Drug Stability', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/chemistry/immunology/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Macrophages/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Nanoparticles/*chemistry', 'Neurodegenerative Diseases', 'Particle Size', 'Polyethylene Glycols/*chemistry', 'Stroke/drug therapy', 'Surface Properties']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4618-0903'],,,['NIHMS997350'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The CR rate after this modified regimen was 100% (n = 15). Twelve patients were able to proceed to allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation, two patients died before transplantation due to infection, and the remaining one who was ineligible for transplant due to her age received an additional five courses of consolidation chemotherapy. Overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) of the study patients was 61.0 and 47.5% at 3 years. OS and relapse-free survival of transplanted patients was 66.8 and 55.0% at 3 years.

In 2011, there was a call for projects relating to long-term follow-up (LTFU), which led to several studies being conducted. Five years later, we sent a questionnaire to present LTFU in France and describe its strengths and weaknesses and to establish appropriate steps that should be taken. METHODS: A questionnaire was sent by email to all the members of the French Society of Childhood Cancers in spring 2016. The study involved 44 centres/hospitals with a Paediatric Oncology Department. RESULTS: 54 answers were analysed, provided by 31/44 (70%) centres working together with the French Society of Childhood Cancers. Screening is the main objective of LTFU care (90%). The main difficulties that arose were: lack of sufficient time to devote to this activity (57%), difficulties contacting adult childhood cancer survivors (aCCSs) (26%), aCCSs who ultimately did not show up to the consultation (19%), cost (15%), and lack of organization (13%). Seven LTFU programmes were identified: two regional organizations (Rhone Alpes and Grand Ouest), four centre-size organizations, and one national study (involving 15 Haematology Centres) relating to Child and Adolescent Leukaemia. CONCLUSION: LTFU is a major concern for French centres specialized in paediatric oncology. Organization is not well defined and difficulties still arise (Who are the best care providers? What frequency of care is most appropriate? etc.). Advances in knowledge: LTFU focused on health problems (physical, psychological, social, economic issues) that affect CCSs is needed to ensure that these patients regain the most optimal physical and emotional health possible. Practitioners suggest different ways to improve LTFU, such as national co-operation with Epidemiology Registers to promote homogenous LTFU care.","['Demoor-Goldschmidt, Charlotte', 'Tabone, Marie-Dominique', 'Bernier, Valerie', 'de Vathaire, Florent', 'Berger, Claire']","['Demoor-Goldschmidt C', 'Tabone MD', 'Bernier V', 'de Vathaire F', 'Berger C']","['1 Cancer and Radiation team, Centre for Research in Epidemiology and Population Health (CESP), INSERM U1018, University Paris-Sud, UVSQ, University Paris-Saclay , Villejuif , France.', '2 Department of Pediatric Onco-hematology, CHU Angers , Angers , France.', '3 Department of Pediatric Onco-hematology, Hopital Armand Trousseau , Paris , France.', '4 Department of Radiation Oncology, Institut de Cancerologie de Lorraine , Nancy , France.', '1 Cancer and Radiation team, Centre for Research in Epidemiology and Population Health (CESP), INSERM U1018, University Paris-Sud, UVSQ, University Paris-Saclay , Villejuif , France.', '5 Department of hemato-oncology pediatric, Chu nord st Etienne , Saint-Etienne , France.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20180110,England,Br J Radiol,The British journal of radiology,0373125,PMC5966008,,,2018/01/03 06:00,2018/04/03 06:00,['2018/01/03 06:00'],"['2018/01/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/04/03 06:00 [medline]', '2018/01/03 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1259/bjr.20170819 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Radiol. 2018 Apr;91(1084):20170819. doi: 10.1259/bjr.20170819.

Medical records of 18 patients having 20 episodes of NEP were reviewed retrospectively. Primary diagnosis was acute lymphoblastic leukemia in 12 and myeloblastic leukemia in 6 cases. According to prognosis, 3 patients were in the standard-risk group, 6 in the moderate-risk group, and 9 in the high-risk group. Ultrasonography detected increased bowel wall thickness in 6 patients. Abdominal x-ray revealed air-fluid levels (n=8), pneumatosis intestinalis, pneumoperitoneum (n=1), and portal venous gas (n=1). All patients received medical treatment, and 1 with unrelieved hematochezia required resection of the cecum. Two cases with appendicitis and another 1 with pneumoperitoneum responded to antibiotics and recovered without surgery. The mortality rate was 30% and related to sepsis-induced complications. The presence of hypokalemia, hypoalbuminemia, metabolic acidosis, and admission to the intensive care unit were more common in patients with mortality (P=0.01). In conclusion, NEP should be kept in mind as a treatable but potentially lethal complication of childhood leukemia. Radiologic findings should be interpreted in conjunction with clinical picture.

Although this malignancy is relatively frequent after solid-organ transplant, it is extremely rare after bone marrow transplantation. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation is associated with severe prolonged immunosuppression; however, a few cases of Kaposi sarcoma after hematopoietic stem cell transplant were previously reported. Here, we report a case of Kaposi sarcoma after haploidentical allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant. The patient was a known case of acute myelogenous leukemia and underwent transplant after relapse. Four months posttransplant, she presented with 3 dark blue or purplish small nodules on her face above the upper lip. Histopathologic study confirmed Kaposi sarcoma. Serum antibody against human herpes virus type 8 was positive. After discontinuation of immunosuppressive medication and cryotherapy for local control, Kaposi sarcoma skin nodules healed with residual pigmented skin lesions. The patient is currently in complete remission for Kaposi sarcoma and cured from acute myelogenous leukemia 36 months after stem cell transplant. Only 14 cases of Kaposi sarcoma after hematopoietic cell transplant have been previously reported in the literature (11 after allogeneic and 3 after autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant). According to our knowledge from literature review, this case is the first report of Kaposi sarcoma after a haploidentical HLA match transplant.","['Ramzi, Mani', 'Vojdani, Reza', 'Haghighinejad, Hourvash']","['Ramzi M', 'Vojdani R', 'Haghighinejad H']","['From the Hematology Research Center, Department of Hematology, Medical Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation; Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.']",['eng'],,['Case Reports'],20180102,Turkey,Exp Clin Transplant,Experimental and clinical transplantation : official journal of the Middle East Society for Organ Transplantation,101207333,,,,2018/01/03 06:00,2018/01/03 06:00,['2018/01/03 06:00'],"['2018/01/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/03 06:00 [medline]', '2018/01/03 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.6002/ect.2017.0075 [doi]'],ppublish,Exp Clin Transplant. 2021 Feb;19(2):173-175. doi: 10.6002/ect.2017.0075.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Ninety-seven patients with AML who did not achieve CR after the first course of standard chemotherapy were enrolled. Among them, 45 patients received G-CSF priming combined with low-dose chemotherapy during days 20-22 of the first course of chemotherapy, serving as priming group, 52 patients were administered standard chemotherapy again, serving as control group. RESULTS: Between the two groups there were no differences in the French-American-British (FAB) classification, risk status, the first course of chemotherapy, blood cell count or blasts percentage of bone marrow before the second course. But the CR rate was significantly higher and the adverse effect was much lower in the priming group than the control group. Cox multivariate regression analysis showed that WBC level before the second course and the selection of the second chemotherapy regimen were two independent factors for long survival of patients. DISCUSSION: These results elucidate that standard chemotherapy followed by G-CSF priming new double induction chemotherapy is an effective method for AML patients to improve CR rate and reduce adverse effects.","['Shen, Ying', 'He, Aili', 'Wang, Fangxia', 'Bai, Ju', 'Wang, Jianli', 'Zhao, Wanhong', 'Zhang, Wanggang', 'Cao, Xingmei', 'Chen, Yinxia', 'Liu, Jie', 'Ma, Xiaorong', 'Chen, Hongli', 'Feng, Yuandong', 'Yang, Yun']","['Shen Y', 'He A', 'Wang F', 'Bai J', 'Wang J', 'Zhao W', 'Zhang W', 'Cao X', 'Chen Y', 'Liu J', 'Ma X', 'Chen H', 'Feng Y', 'Yang Y']","[""Department of Hematology, Second Affiliated Hospital, Xi'an Jiaotong University, 710004 Xi'an, Shaanxi, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Second Affiliated Hospital, Xi'an Jiaotong University, 710004 Xi'an, Shaanxi, China; National-Local Joint Engineering Research Center of Biodiagnostics and Biotherapy, 710004 Xi'an, Shaanxi, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Second Affiliated Hospital, Xi'an Jiaotong University, 710004 Xi'an, Shaanxi, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Second Affiliated Hospital, Xi'an Jiaotong University, 710004 Xi'an, Shaanxi, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Second Affiliated Hospital, Xi'an Jiaotong University, 710004 Xi'an, Shaanxi, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Second Affiliated Hospital, Xi'an Jiaotong University, 710004 Xi'an, Shaanxi, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Second Affiliated Hospital, Xi'an Jiaotong University, 710004 Xi'an, Shaanxi, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Second Affiliated Hospital, Xi'an Jiaotong University, 710004 Xi'an, Shaanxi, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Second Affiliated Hospital, Xi'an Jiaotong University, 710004 Xi'an, Shaanxi, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Second Affiliated Hospital, Xi'an Jiaotong University, 710004 Xi'an, Shaanxi, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Second Affiliated Hospital, Xi'an Jiaotong University, 710004 Xi'an, Shaanxi, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Second Affiliated Hospital, Xi'an Jiaotong University, 710004 Xi'an, Shaanxi, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Second Affiliated Hospital, Xi'an Jiaotong University, 710004 Xi'an, Shaanxi, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Second Affiliated Hospital, Xi'an Jiaotong University, 710004 Xi'an, Shaanxi, China.

Anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family inhibitors, such as venetoclax, are promising therapies for AML. Nonetheless, resistance is emerging. We demonstrate that venetoclax combined with cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor alvocidib is potently synergistic in venetoclax-sensitive and -resistant AML models in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo. Alvocidib decreased MCL-1, and/or increased pro-apoptotic proteins such as BIM or NOXA, often synergistically with venetoclax. Over-expression of BCL-XL diminished synergy, while knock-down of BIM almost entirely abrogated synergy, demonstrating that the synergistic interaction between alvocidib and venetoclax is primarily dependent on intrinsic apoptosis. CDK9 inhibition predominantly mediated venetoclax sensitization, while CDK4/6 inhibition with palbociclib did not potentiate venetoclax activity. Combined, venetoclax and alvocidib modulate the balance of BCL-2 family proteins through complementary, yet variable mechanisms favoring apoptosis, highlighting this combination as a promising therapy for AML or high-risk MDS with the capacity to overcome intrinsic apoptosis mechanisms of resistance. These results support clinical testing of combined venetoclax and alvocidib for the treatment of AML and advanced MDS.","['Bogenberger, James', 'Whatcott, Clifford', 'Hansen, Nanna', 'Delman, Devora', 'Shi, Chang-Xin', 'Kim, Wontak', 'Haws, Hillary', 'Soh, Katherine', 'Lee, Ye Sol', 'Peterson, Peter', 'Siddiqui-Jain, Adam', 'Weitman, Steven', 'Stewart, Keith', 'Bearss, David', 'Mesa, Ruben', 'Warner, Steven', 'Tibes, Raoul']","['Bogenberger J', 'Whatcott C', 'Hansen N', 'Delman D', 'Shi CX', 'Kim W', 'Haws H', 'Soh K', 'Lee YS', 'Peterson P', 'Siddiqui-Jain A', 'Weitman S', 'Stewart K', 'Bearss D', 'Mesa R', 'Warner S', 'Tibes R']","['Mayo Clinic, Scottsdale, AZ, USA.', 'Tolero Pharmaceuticals, Lehi, UT, USA.', 'Mayo Clinic, Scottsdale, AZ, USA.', 'Mayo Clinic, Scottsdale, AZ, USA.', 'Mayo Clinic, Scottsdale, AZ, USA.', 'Tolero Pharmaceuticals, Lehi, UT, USA.', 'Tolero Pharmaceuticals, Lehi, UT, USA.', 'Tolero Pharmaceuticals, Lehi, UT, USA.', 'Tolero Pharmaceuticals, Lehi, UT, USA.', 'Tolero Pharmaceuticals, Lehi, UT, USA.', 'Tolero Pharmaceuticals, Lehi, UT, USA.', 'Tolero Pharmaceuticals, Lehi, UT, USA.', 'Mayo Clinic, Scottsdale, AZ, USA.', 'Tolero Pharmaceuticals, Lehi, UT, USA.', 'Mayo Clinic, Scottsdale, AZ, USA.', 'Tolero Pharmaceuticals, Lehi, UT, USA.', 'Mayo Clinic, Scottsdale, AZ, USA.', 'NYU School of Medicine, New York, NY, USA.']",['eng'],['P30 CA054174/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['Journal Article'],20171103,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,PMC5739808,['NOTNLM'],"['BCL-2', 'acute myeloid leukemia (AML)', 'alvocidib/flavopiridol', 'venetoclax/ABT-199']",2018/01/02 06:00,2018/01/02 06:01,['2018/01/02 06:00'],"['2017/07/22 00:00 [received]', '2017/10/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/01/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/02 06:01 [medline]']","['10.18632/oncotarget.22284 [doi]', '22284 [pii]']",epublish,Oncotarget. 2017 Nov 3;8(63):107206-107222. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.22284. eCollection 2017 Dec 5.,,63,,,,,,"['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST C.J.W., W.K., H.H., K.K.S., Y.L., P.P., A.S-J., S.W.,', 'D.J.B. and S.L.W. are employed by Tolero Pharmaceuticals.

In the current study, the JAK2 inhibitor TG101209 was used to treat T-ALL cell lines and primary T-ALL cells. The effects of TG101209 on T-ALL cells were determined, and the signaling proteins related to cell growth, apoptosis and autophagy were analysed. The results indicated that TG101209 significantly inhibited T-ALL cell proliferation and induced cell apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. The mechanisms involved the suppression of the JAK2-STAT signaling pathway and activation of apoptosis or autophagy. Additionally, a JAK2 gene copy gain (FISH) and up-regulated JAK2, LC3 and Beclin1 expression (western blotting) were observed in T-ALL samples compared with healthy controls, which implied that JAK2 is a target for T-ALL treatment. TG101209 initiated apoptosis and autophagy in T-ALL cells; therefore, this JAK2 inhibitor may be a potential drug or alternative therapy for T-ALL.","['Cheng, Zhao', 'Yi, Yifang', 'Xie, Sisi', 'Yu, Haizhi', 'Peng, Hongling', 'Zhang, Guangsen']","['Cheng Z', 'Yi Y', 'Xie S', 'Yu H', 'Peng H', 'Zhang G']","['Department of Hematology, The Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, 410011, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, 410011, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, 410011, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, 410011, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, 410011, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, 410011, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20171023,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,PMC5739771,['NOTNLM'],"['JAK -STAT', 'T-ALL', 'apoptosis', 'autophagy']",2018/01/02 06:00,2018/01/02 06:01,['2018/01/02 06:00'],"['2017/03/22 00:00 [received]', '2017/09/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/01/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/02 06:01 [medline]']","['10.18632/oncotarget.22053 [doi]', '22053 [pii]']",epublish,Oncotarget. 2017 Oct 23;8(63):106753-106763. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.22053. eCollection 2017 Dec 5.,,63,,,,,,['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST The authors declare that they have no competing interests.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, using cell lines as valid models for evaluating responses to novel drug therapies raises serious concerns, as cell lines are prone to genotypic/phenotypic drift and loss of heterogeneity in vitro. Here, we reported that OP9 cells, not OP9-derived adipocytes (OP9TA), support the growth of primary B-ALL cells in vitro. To identify the factors from OP9 cells that support the growth of primary B-ALL cells, we performed RNA-Seq to analyze the gene expression profiles of OP9 and OP9TA cells. We thus developed a defined, serum/feeder-free condition (FI76V) that can support the expansion of a range of clinically distinct primary B-ALL cells that still maintain their leukemia-initiating ability. We demonstrated the suitability of high-throughput drug screening based on our B-ALL cultured conditions. Upon screening 378 kinase inhibitors, we identified a cluster of 17 kinase inhibitors that can efficiently kill B-ALL cells in vitro. Importantly, we demonstrated the synergistic cytotoxicity of dinaciclib/BTG226 to B-ALL cells. Taken together, we developed a defined condition for the ex vivo expansion of primary B-ALL cells that is suitable for high-throughput screening of novel compounds.","['Jiang, Zhiwu', 'Wu, Di', 'Ye,

CXCR4 is also involved in survival, proliferation and dissemination of cancer, including acute lymphoblastic and myeloid leukemia (ALL, AML). Relapsed/refractory ALL and AML are frequently resistant to conventional therapy and novel highly active strategies are urgently needed to overcome resistance. Methods: We used patient-derived (PDX) and cell line-based xenograft mouse models of ALL and AML to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of a CXCR4-targeted endoradiotherapy (ERT) theranostic approach. Results: The positron emission tomography (PET) tracer (68)Ga-Pentixafor enabled visualization of CXCR4 positive leukemic burden. In xenografts, CXCR4-directed ERT with (177)Lu-Pentixather distributed to leukemia harboring organs and resulted in efficient reduction of leukemia. Despite a substantial in vivo cross-fire effect to the leukemia microenvironment, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) subjected to ERT were viable and capable of supporting the growth and differentiation of non-targeted normal hematopoietic cells ex vivo. Finally, three patients with refractory AML after first allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT) underwent CXCR4-directed ERT resulting in leukemia clearance, second alloSCT, and successful hematopoietic engraftment. Conclusion: Targeting CXCR4 with ERT is feasible and provides a highly efficient means to reduce refractory acute leukemia for subsequent cellular therapies. Prospective clinical trials testing the incorporation of CXCR4 targeting into conditioning regimens for alloSCT are highly warranted.","['Habringer, Stefan', 'Lapa, Constantin', 'Herhaus, Peter', 'Schottelius, Margret', 'Istvanffy, Rouzanna', 'Steiger, Katja', 'Slotta-Huspenina, Julia', 'Schirbel, Andreas', 'Hanscheid, Heribert', 'Kircher, Stefan', 'Buck, Andreas K', 'Gotze, Katharina', 'Vick, Binje', 'Jeremias, Irmela', 'Schwaiger, Markus', 'Peschel, Christian', 'Oostendorp, Robert', 'Wester, Hans-Jurgen', 'Grigoleit, Gotz-Ulrich', 'Keller, Ulrich']","['Habringer S', 'Lapa C', 'Herhaus P', 'Schottelius M', 'Istvanffy R', 'Steiger K', 'Slotta-Huspenina J', 'Schirbel A', 'Hanscheid H', 'Kircher S', 'Buck AK', 'Gotze K', 'Vick B', 'Jeremias I', 'Schwaiger M', 'Peschel C', 'Oostendorp R', 'Wester HJ', 'Grigoleit GU', 'Keller U']","['Internal Medicine III, Hematology and Medical Oncology, Technische Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK) and German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Nuclear Medicine, University Hospital Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany.', 'Internal Medicine III, Hematology and Medical Oncology, Technische Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany.', 'Institute of Pharmaceutical Radiochemistry, Technische Universitat Munchen, Garching, Germany.', 'Internal Medicine III, Hematology and Medical Oncology, Technische Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology, Technische Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology, Technische Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Nuclear Medicine, University Hospital Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany.', 'Department of Nuclear Medicine, University Hospital Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany.', 'Institute for Pathology, University of Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany.', 'Department of Nuclear Medicine, University Hospital Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany.', 'Internal Medicine III, Hematology and Medical Oncology, Technische Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK) and German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK) and German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Research Unit Gene Vectors, Helmholtz Center Munich, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK) and German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Research Unit Gene Vectors, Helmholtz Center Munich, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK) and German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Nuclear Medicine, Technische Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany.', 'Internal Medicine III, Hematology and Medical Oncology, Technische Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK) and German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Internal Medicine III, Hematology and Medical Oncology, Technische Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany.', 'Institute of Pharmaceutical Radiochemistry, Technische Universitat Munchen, Garching, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine II, Hematology and Medical Oncology, University Hospital Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany.', 'Internal Medicine III, Hematology and Medical Oncology, Technische Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK) and German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180101,Australia,Theranostics,Theranostics,101552395,PMC5743554,['NOTNLM'],"['*C-X-C chemokine receptor 4', '*acute leukemia', '*in vivo molecular imaging', '*microenvironment', '*theranostics']",2018/01/02 06:00,2018/12/12 06:00,['2018/01/02 06:00'],"['2017/06/09 00:00 [received]', '2017/10/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/01/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/12/12 06:00 [medline]']","['10.7150/thno.21397 [doi]', 'thnov08p0369 [pii]']",epublish,Theranostics. 2018 Jan 1;8(2):369-383. doi: 10.7150/thno.21397. eCollection 2018.,20181211,2,"['0 (177Lu-pentixather)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Middle Aged', 'Peptides/*administration & dosage', 'Receptors, CXCR4/*metabolism', 'Theranostic Nanomedicine/*methods']",,,"['Competing Interests: H.J.W. is shareholder of Scintomics (Germany).

However, its functions in normal and malignant hematopoiesis remain elusive. Here, we report that METTL14, a key component of the m(6)A methyltransferase complex, is highly expressed in normal hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells carrying t(11q23), t(15;17), or t(8;21) and is downregulated during myeloid differentiation. Silencing of METTL14 promotes terminal myeloid differentiation of normal HSPCs and AML cells and inhibits AML cell survival/proliferation. METTL14 is required for development and maintenance of AML and self-renewal of leukemia stem/initiation cells (LSCs/LICs). Mechanistically, METTL14 exerts its oncogenic role by regulating its mRNA targets (e.g., MYB and MYC) through m(6)A modification, while the protein itself is negatively regulated by SPI1. Collectively, our results reveal the SPI1-METTL14-MYB/MYC signaling axis in myelopoiesis and leukemogenesis and highlight the critical roles of METTL14 and m(6)A modification in normal and malignant hematopoiesis.","['Weng, Hengyou', 'Huang, Huilin', 'Wu, Huizhe', 'Qin, Xi', 'Zhao, Boxuan Simen', 'Dong, Lei', 'Shi, Hailing', 'Skibbe, Jennifer', 'Shen, Chao', 'Hu, Chao', 'Sheng, Yue', 'Wang, Yungui', 'Wunderlich, Mark', 'Zhang, Bin', 'Dore, Louis C', 'Su, Rui', 'Deng, Xiaolan', 'Ferchen, Kyle', 'Li, Chenying', 'Sun, Miao', 'Lu, Zhike', 'Jiang, Xi', 'Marcucci, Guido', 'Mulloy, James C', 'Yang, Jianhua', 'Qian, Zhijian', 'Wei, Minjie', 'He, Chuan', 'Chen, Jianjun']","['Weng H', 'Huang H', 'Wu H', 'Qin X', 'Zhao BS', 'Dong L', 'Shi H', 'Skibbe J', 'Shen C', 'Hu C', 'Sheng Y', 'Wang Y', 'Wunderlich M', 'Zhang B', 'Dore LC', 'Su R', 'Deng X', 'Ferchen K', 'Li C', 'Sun M', 'Lu Z', 'Jiang X', 'Marcucci G', 'Mulloy JC', 'Yang J', 'Qian Z', 'Wei M', 'He C', 'Chen J']","['Department of Cancer Biology, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH 45219, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH 45219, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH 45219, USA; Department of Pharmacology, School of Pharmacy, China Medical University, Shenyang, Liaoning 110122, China.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH 45219, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Institute for Biophysical Dynamics, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH 45219, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Institute for Biophysical Dynamics, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH 45219, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH 45219, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH 45219, USA; Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang 310003, China.', 'Department of Medicine and Cancer Research Center, The University of Illinois, Chicago, IL 60612, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH 45219, USA; Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang 310003, China.', ""Division of Experimental Hematology and Cancer Biology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH 45229, USA."", 'Department of Hematologic Malignancies Translational Science and Gehr Family Leukemia Center, City of Hope, Duarte, CA 91010, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Institute for Biophysical Dynamics, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH 45219, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH 45219, USA; Department of Pharmacology, School of Pharmacy, China Medical University, Shenyang, Liaoning 110122, China.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH 45219, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH 45219, USA; Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang 310003, China.', ""Division of Human Genetics, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH 45229, USA."", 'Department of Chemistry, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Institute for Biophysical Dynamics, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH 45219, USA.', 'Department of Hematologic Malignancies Translational Science and Gehr Family Leukemia Center, City of Hope, Duarte, CA 91010, USA.', ""Division of Experimental Hematology and Cancer Biology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH 45229, USA."", 'Key Laboratory of Gene Engineering of the Ministry of Education, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou 510275, China.', 'Department of Medicine and Cancer Research Center, The University of Illinois, Chicago, IL 60612, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacology, School of Pharmacy, China Medical University, Shenyang, Liaoning 110122, China.

Patients with MDS suffer significant impairments to both their quality of life and survival. Age is the dominant risk factor for the development of MDS, with a median age at diagnosis over 70years. Consequently, patients with MDS frequently have concurrent comorbidities and/or frailty which may be coincident or related to the disease itself. Disease characteristics, degree of comorbidity, and presence of frailty all impact prognosis. Treatment of MDS focuses on supportive care, with disease-modifying approaches (chemotherapy and allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation) reserved for fit patients with high-risk disease. Care of patients with MDS requires understanding the disease in the context of an older population, and tailoring approaches to both disease risk and patient suitability for therapy.","['Luskin, Marlise R', 'Abel, Gregory A']","['Luskin MR', 'Abel GA']","['Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, 450 Brookline Avenue, Dana 2056, Boston, MA 02215, USA; Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.

Because lineage commitment hierarchies differ between embryo and adult, and the impact of oncogenes is cell-context dependent, we hypothesized that the childhood affiliation of ETV6-RUNX1 cALL reflects its origins in a progenitor unique to embryonic life. We characterize the first emerging B cells in first-trimester human embryos, identifying a developmentally restricted CD19(-)IL-7R(+) progenitor compartment, which transitions from a myeloid to lymphoid program during ontogeny. This developmental series is recapitulated in differentiating human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), thereby providing a model for the initiation of cALL. Genome-engineered hPSCs expressing ETV6-RUNX1 from the endogenous ETV6 locus show expansion of the CD19(-)IL-7R(+) compartment, show a partial block in B lineage commitment, and produce proB cells with aberrant myeloid gene expression signatures and potential: features (collectively) consistent with a pre-leukemic state.","['Boiers, Charlotta', 'Richardson, Simon E', 'Laycock, Emma', 'Zriwil, Alya', 'Turati, Virginia A', 'Brown, John', 'Wray, Jason P', 'Wang, Dapeng', 'James, Chela', 'Herrero, Javier', 'Sitnicka, Ewa', 'Karlsson, Stefan', 'Smith, Andrew J H', 'Jacobsen, Sten Erik W', 'Enver, Tariq']","['Boiers C', 'Richardson SE', 'Laycock E', 'Zriwil A', 'Turati VA', 'Brown J', 'Wray JP', 'Wang D', 'James C', 'Herrero J', 'Sitnicka E', 'Karlsson S', 'Smith AJH', 'Jacobsen SEW', 'Enver T']","['Department of Cancer Biology, UCL Cancer Institute, UCL, London, UK; Lund Stem Cell Center, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, UCL Cancer Institute, UCL, London, UK.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, UCL Cancer Institute, UCL, London, UK.', 'Lund Stem Cell Center, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, UCL Cancer Institute, UCL, London, UK.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, UCL Cancer Institute, UCL, London, UK.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, UCL Cancer Institute, UCL, London, UK.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, UCL Cancer Institute, UCL, London, UK.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, UCL Cancer Institute, UCL, London, UK.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, UCL Cancer Institute, UCL, London, UK.', 'Lund Stem Cell Center, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Lund Stem Cell Center, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'MRC Centre for Regenerative Medicine, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK; MRC Molecular Haematology Unit, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.', 'MRC Molecular Haematology Unit, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK; Departments of Cell and Molecular Biology and Medicine Huddinge, Center for Hematology and Regenerative Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden; Haematopoietic Stem Cell Laboratory, Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK; Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, UCL Cancer Institute, UCL, London, UK; Lund Stem Cell Center, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.

STUDY DESIGN: An observational study. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: The Hematology/Oncology Unit of The Children's Hospital and Institute of Child Health, Lahore, from January 2012 till December 2014. METHODOLOGY: Demographics including age, gender, histopathology, stage and outcome data, in biopsy proven NHL patients were analyzed. Burkitts/B Cell and Diffuse Large B Cell lymphoma patients were treated with MCP 842 Protocol while T/B-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma (LL) patients were treated with EURO-LB 02 protocol. RESULTS: Ninety-one patients were treated during the study period at CHL. Data was insufficient in 18 patients, so they were excluded from the study. Patients included were 73. Males were 53 (72.6%). Thirty-seven (50.7%) were 5-10 years of age, and 22 (30.1%) 10-16 years old. Abdominal mass was the commonest presentation seen in 32 (43.8%), lymphadenopathy in 27 (37%), intussusception in 5 (6.8%), while intestinal obstruction, obstructive uropathy, nasopharyngeal mass, gastric mass, primary bone lymphoma, pericardial effusion, jaw swelling, cheek swelling and paraspinal mass present in one (1%) each. Histopathological subtypes consist of Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) in 32 (43.8%), B cell NHL in 10 (13.7%), lymphoblastic lymphoma (LL) in 26 (35.6%), diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) in 2 (2.8%), and anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) in 1 (1.4%). Sixty-seven (91%) presented in stage III, and six (8.4%) in stage IV. Forty-eight (65.8%) patients had completed treatment and are well to date, 16 (21.9%) died, 5 (6.8%) left against medical advice (LAMA), and 4 (5.5%) patients relapsed. CONCLUSION: Burkitts lymphoma was the commonest type of NHL seen in this cohort that predominantly presented with an abdominal mass. Children usually presented in advanced stage with delayed diagnosis. Better supportive care can improve the prognosis significantly. Training of pediatricians is equally important along with increasing parental/family knowledge about the disease symptoms so that they can seek early medical care, and earlier diagnosis is possible.","['Faizan, Mahwish', 'Anwar, Saadia', 'Khan, Safia']","['Faizan M', 'Anwar S', 'Khan S']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology Oncology, he Children Hospital and Institute of Child Health, Lahore.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology Oncology, he Children Hospital and Institute of Child Health, Lahore.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology Oncology, he Children Hospital and Institute of Child Health, Lahore.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Pakistan,J Coll Physicians Surg Pak,Journal of the College of Physicians and Surgeons--Pakistan : JCPSP,9606447,,,,2018/01/02 06:00,2018/06/05 06:00,['2018/01/02 06:00'],"['2016/11/03 00:00 [received]', '2017/11/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/01/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/06/05 06:00 [medline]']","['040579197 [pii]', '10.29271/jcpsp.2018.01.48 [doi]']",ppublish,J Coll Physicians Surg Pak. 2018 Jan;28(1):48-51. doi: 10.29271/jcpsp.2018.01.48.,20180604,1,"['18D0SL7309 (Chlorambucil)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'MCP protocol']",IM,"['Adolescent', '*Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/drug therapy/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chlorambucil', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Hospitals, Pediatric', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/drug therapy/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*drug therapy/mortality/*pathology', 'Male', 'Mitoxantrone', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Pakistan/epidemiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma', 'Prednisolone', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Very limited data are available regarding ED in patients with relapsed APL. In this retrospective study, 285 de novo and 79 relapsed patients were included. All patients received single-agent arsenic trioxide as induction therapy. The differences in baseline clinical features, incidence, causes, and prognostic factors of ED were compared between the two patient cohorts. The relapse cohort exhibited a better overall condition than the de novo cohort upon hospital admission. The ED rate in the relapsed patients (24.1%) was somewhat higher than that in the de novo patients (17.9%), although the difference was not significant (P = 0.219). For both cohorts, hemorrhage was the main cause of ED, followed by differentiation syndrome, infection, and other causes. Increased serum creatinine level, older age, male sex, white blood cell (WBC) count > 10 x 10(9)/L, and fibrinogen < 1 g/L were independently risk factors for ED in the de novo patients, whereas WBC count > 10 x 10(9)/L, elevated serum uric acid level, and D-dimer > 4 mg/L were independent risk factors for ED in the relapsed patients.

We examined if a hospital-based diagnosis of pneumonia was a clinical marker of the three most common childhood cancers. DESIGN: Population-based cohort study. SETTING: Denmark, hospital diagnoses, 1994-2013. METHODS: Using national health registries, we compared the observed incidence of leukaemia, lymphoma and brain cancer among 83 935 children with a hospital-based pneumonia diagnosis with that expected among children in the general population. We calculated absolute cancer risks and standardised incidence ratios (SIRs) as a measure of relative risk. RESULTS: The cancer SIRs were substantially increased during the first 6 months of follow-up; lymphoid leukaemia: 6.2 (95% CI 3.5 to 10.3); myeloid leukaemia: 14.8 (95% CI 6.0 to 30.6); Hodgkin's lymphoma: 60.8 (95% CI 26.2 to 120), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma: 15.9 (95% CI 5.2 to 37.2) and brain cancer: 4.4 (95% CI 1.9 to 8.7). The 6-month absolute risks of leukaemia, lymphoma and brain cancer were all low, reaching 0.05% when combined. An increased risk persisted beyond 5 years for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and brain cancer.

Although it is mostly an indolent disease it is still incurable and with limited knowledge in relation to its etiology. We aim to confirm and quantify established risk factors for CLL/SLL using a multi-center epidemiological population-based case-control study on CLL/SLL as well as to explore new exposures inconclusively associated with CLL/SLL METHODS: Using the framework provided by the large MCC-Spain case-control study, we explored established and suggested risk factors associated with CLL/SLL using data collected through a face-to-face interview. We estimated odds ratios (OR) and confidence intervals (CI) adjusted by basic confounders, in 1,845 controls from the general population and 560 CLL/SLL from 5 different Spanish regions. RESULTS: Among the established risk factors, CLL/SLL cases were 3 times more likely to report first degree relatives with an hematological cancer (OR=3.11, 95% CI 2.10 to 4.61) and nearly twice likely to have ever worked in agriculture (OR=1.70, 95% CI=1.34 to 2.16). New findings suggest that women with CLL/SLL were more likely to have central obesity (OR=1.67 95% CI=1.12 to 2.48). An inverse association was found for current alcohol consumption (p-trend<0.016) and for type II diabetes. CONCLUSION: We confirmed previous established risk factors for CLL/SLL. Among the new findings, further research of central obesity as preventable exposure and the treatment for type II diabetes are warranted.","['Benavente, Yolanda', 'Casabonne, Delphine', 'Costas, Laura', 'Robles, Claudia', 'Alonso, Esther', 'de la Banda, Esmeralda', 'Gonzalez-Barca, Eva', 'Marcos-Gragera, Rafael', 'Llorca, Javier', 'Tardon, Adonina', 'Monleon, Jose J', 'Aymerich, Marta', 'Campo, Elias', 'Gimeno-Vazquez, Eva', 'Castano-Vinyals, Gemma', 'Aragones, Nuria', 'Pollan, Marina', 'Kogevinas, Manolis', 'de Sanjose, Silvia']","['Benavente Y', 'Casabonne D', 'Costas L', 'Robles C', 'Alonso E', 'de la Banda E', 'Gonzalez-Barca E', 'Marcos-Gragera R', 'Llorca J', 'Tardon A', 'Monleon JJ', 'Aymerich M', 'Campo E', 'Gimeno-Vazquez E', 'Castano-Vinyals G', 'Aragones N', 'Pollan M', 'Kogevinas M', 'de Sanjose S']","[""Unit of Infections and Cancer (UNIC), Cancer Epidemiology Research Programme, IDIBELL, Institut Catala d'Oncologia, 08908, L'Hospitalet De Llobregat, Barcelona, Spain; CIBER Epidemiologia y Salud Publica (CIBERESP), 28029, Madrid, Spain.

The molecular function of EZH2 is to establish H3K27me3 mark on specific genes by which promotes transcriptional repression of target genes. The activity of EZH2 affects the balance between self-renewal and differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells. In addition, EZH2 contributes to the cell cycle regulation in mature lymphocytes. A large number of studies have been performed to identify the implication of EZH2 in tumor development of leukemia. Aberrant expression of EZH2 is increasingly recognized in leukemic malignancies. To clarify its therapeutic potential in hematopoietic malignancies it should be determined whether EZH2 is involved in the pathology of these neoplasms. This paper reviews the current knowledge of the role of EZH2 in the pathogenesis of myeloid and lymphoid leukemia. We will discuss the mechanisms in which microRNAs regulate the expression of EZH2 in different types of leukemias that may provide a means to alter cancer epigenetics associated to tumorogenesis to achieve therapeutic benefits.","['Safaei, Sahar', 'Baradaran, Behzad', 'Hagh, Majid Farshdousti', 'Alivand, Mohammad Reza', 'Talebi, Mehdi', 'Gharibi, Tohid', 'Solali, Saeed']","['Safaei S', 'Baradaran B', 'Hagh MF', 'Alivand MR', 'Talebi M', 'Gharibi T', 'Solali S']","['Immunology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran; Department of Immunology, Division of Hematology and Transfusion Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Immunology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Hematology and Oncology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran; Drug Applied Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Department of Medical Genetics, Faculty of Medicine, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Hematology and Oncology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Immunology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran; Department of Immunology, Faculty of Medicine, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Molecular Medicine Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran; Immunology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran; Department of Immunology, Division of Hematology and Transfusion Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.

Autologous SCT (auto-SCT) and haploidentical donor SCT (haplo-SCT) are the widely used alternatives in cases of a lack of a HLA-matched donor. However, limited data have been published on the direct comparison between these 2 transplant types. Based on the transplant database in our center, we conducted a retrospective study involving patients with favorable- and intermediate-risk AML in first complete remission (CR1), according to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guideline. Patients with extramedullary disease or those achieving CR by more than 2 cycles were excluded. In total, 195 patients were included in the study, 88 of whom underwent auto-SCT and 107 haplo-SCT. In the entire cohort analyses the impact of high relapse incidence in the auto-SCT group was compensated by low nonrelapse mortality (NRM), which resulted in a comparable overall survival (OS) (79.0% +/- 4.6% versus 80.1% +/- 5.0%, P = .769) and relapse-free survival (RFS) (66.1% +/- 5.2% versus 77.4% +/- 4.8%, P = .079) compared with those observed in the haplo-SCT group. However, for patients with intermediate-risk AML, NRM was similar between the groups, and haplo-SCT exhibited superior survival. In case of post-SCT relapse, patients with intermediate-risk AML showed markedly inferior 3-year OS compared with that shown by patients with favorable-risk AML (23.3% +/- 9.8% versus 60.8% +/- 14.3%, P = .011). In the multivariate analyses, minimal residual disease (MRD) measured by flow cytometry and gene mutation status before transplantation were independent predictors for both OS and RFS. We concluded that both auto-SCT and haplo-SCT were acceptable options for postremission treatment of patients with favorable- and intermediate-risk AML. Haplo-SCT yielded a better outcome in patients with intermediate-risk AML, but the relapse after SCT still led to a poor outcome. Clearance of MRD before SCT could improve the prognosis after transplantation.","['Chen, Jia', 'Yang, Lingyi', 'Fan, Yi', 'Xu, Yang', 'Han, Yue', 'Tang, Xiaowen', 'Qiu, Huiying', 'Fu, Chengcheng', 'Miao, Miao', 'Chen, Feng', 'Wu, Depei']","['Chen J', 'Yang L', 'Fan Y', 'Xu Y', 'Han Y', 'Tang X', 'Qiu H', 'Fu C', 'Miao M', 'Chen F', 'Wu D']","['Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu Province, China; Institute of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu Province, China; Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu Province, China.', 'Department of Respiratory, the First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu Province, China.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu Province, China.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu Province, China; Institute of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu Province, China; Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu Province, China.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu Province, China; Institute of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu Province, China; Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu Province, China.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu Province, China; Institute of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu Province, China; Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu Province, China.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu Province, China; Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu Province, China.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu Province, China; Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu Province, China.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu Province, China; Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu Province, China.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu Province, China; Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu Province, China.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu Province, China; Institute of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu Province, China; Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu Province, China.

However, many recipients of alloHCT develop graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), in which allogeneic immune responses lead to the damage of healthy tissue. GVHD is a leading cause of nonrelapse mortality and a key contributor to morbidity among patients undergoing alloHCT. Therefore, improving alloHCT outcomes will require treatment strategies that prevent or mitigate GVHD without disrupting GVL activity. Janus kinases (JAKs) are intracellular signaling molecules that are well positioned to regulate GVHD. A variety of cytokines that signal through the JAK signaling pathways play a role in regulating the development, proliferation, and activation of several immune cell types important for GVHD pathogenesis, including dendritic cells, macrophages, T cells, B cells, and neutrophils. Importantly, despite JAK regulation of GVHD, preclinical evidence suggests that JAK inhibition preserves GVL activity. Here we provide an overview of potential roles for JAK signaling in the pathogenesis of acute and chronic GVHD as well as effects on GVL activity. We also review preclinical and clinical results with JAK inhibitors in acute and chronic GVHD settings, with added focus on those actively being evaluated in patients with acute and chronic GVHD.","['Schroeder, Mark A', 'Choi, Jaebok', 'Staser, Karl', 'DiPersio, John F']","['Schroeder MA', 'Choi J', 'Staser K', 'DiPersio JF']","['Washington University School of Medicine, Division of Oncology, Section of Stem Cell Transplantation, St. Louis, Missouri.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Cox regression with time-dependent covariates, landmark analysis, and competing risk models were used to estimate the outcomes and effects of treatment and patient- and disease-related risk factors. RESULTS: The early relapse rate and early nonrelapse mortality (NRM) were 12.8% and 4.4%, respectively. In our study, 77.2% of patients completed postremission therapy: 44% received allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), 20% completed treatment with high-dose cytarabine (HIDAC), and 13% completed treatment with intermediate-dose cytarabine. The 3-year overall survival rate was 67.5% for patients treated with HIDAC and 63.4% after HCT (P = .5876). The NRM and relapse rate at 3 years were 0% and 58.9% after HIDAC and 21.9% and 29.3% after HCT, respectively. HCT reduced the risk of relapse (hazard ratio, 0.6; 95% confidence interval, 0.36-0.98). Total body irradiation-based myeloablative conditioning increased NRM compared with busulfan-based conditioning (hazard ratio, 8.33; 95% confidence interval, 2.52-27.45). CONCLUSION: Most patients with acute myeloid leukemia with intermediate-risk cytogenetics received allogeneic HCT, which decreased the risk of relapse but increased NRM, leading to a similar overall survival for patients who received HCT and HIDAC. Our data support the use of allogeneic transplantation for patients in CR1 from a human leukocyte antigen-matched related or unrelated donor after a busulfan-based myeloablative conditioning regimen as a primary strategy of postremission therapy for eligible younger patients.","['Vydra, Jan', 'Salek, Cyril', 'Schwarz, Jiri', 'Zak, Pavel', 'Novak, Jan', 'Petecukova, Veronika', 'Pecherkova, Pavla', 'Mayer, Jiri', 'Cetkovsky, Petr', 'Racil, Zdenek']","['Vydra J', 'Salek C', 'Schwarz J', 'Zak P', 'Novak J', 'Petecukova V', 'Pecherkova P', 'Mayer J', 'Cetkovsky P', 'Racil Z']","['Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Prague, Czech Republic; Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology and Oncology, Masaryk University and University Hospital Brno, Brno, Czech Republic.

We review recent research regarding functions of Myc as an important modulator in immune disorders, postallogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and several cancers. Myc overexpression has been repeatedly linked to immune disorders and specific cancers, such as myasthenia gravis, psoriasis, pemphigus vulgaris, atherosclerosis, long-term allogeneic survival among HSCT patients, (primary) inflammatory breast cancer, (primary) ovarian carcinoma and hematological malignancies: acute myeloid leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia, Hodgkin's lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.

In this study, we aim to explore the clinicopathological features of myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative (MDS/MPN) neoplasms with 3q26.2/EVI1 rearrangements and determine the potential impact of these cytogenetic abnormalities on treatment response and survival. The study group included 12 cases of MDS/MPN with 3q26.2 rearrangements detected by conventional karyotyping. There were 7 men and 5 women with a median age of 67 years (range, 51-79 years) at time of initial MDS/MPN diagnosis. Ten cases were classified as chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) and 2 were MDS/MPN, unclassifiable. Among CMML cases, 5 (50%) were proliferative type and 5 (50%) were dysplastic type. Based on blast counts, these 10 CMML were: CMML-0 (n=2), CMML-1 (n=3), and CMML-2 (n=5). Eleven (92%) patients had 3q26 rearrangements at the initial diagnosis. Inv(3)(q21q26.2) was most common, identified in 7(58%) patients, followed by t(3;21)(q26.2;q22) in 2 patients and 1 patient each with t(3;3)(q21;q26.2), t(2;3)(p21;q26-27), and t(3;6)(q26.2;q26). Six (50%) patients had 3q26.2 rearrangements as a sole cytogenetic abnormality and 6 (50%) patients had additional cytogenetic abnormalities. Molecular studies revealed DNMT3A mutations in all 3 patients assessed and RAS mutations in 2 of 8 (25%) patients. No mutations in ASXL1 (n=3), TET2 (n=3), FLT3 ITD/D835 (n=10), and CEBPA (n=7) were detected. Most patients received hypomethylating agent based chemotherapy. The median follow-up was 11.5 months (range, 1.5-24 months) and at time of last follow-up, 11 (92%) died with a median survival of 13.4 months (range, 1.5-24 months). The only patient alive had a relatively short follow-up of 2.4 months and showed disease progression at the last visit. In conclusion, 3q26.2/EVI1 rearrangements are a rare event and usually present at time of initial diagnosis in MDS/MPN. The presence of 3q26.2/EVI1 rearrangements in MDS/MPN is associated with rapid disease progression, poor response to treatment, and a poor prognosis.","['Hu, Zhihong', 'Hu, Shimin', 'Ji, Changsheng', 'Tang, Zhenya', 'Thakral, Beenu', 'Loghavi, Sanam', 'Medeiros, L Jeffrey', 'Wang, Wei']","['Hu Z', 'Hu S', 'Ji C', 'Tang Z', 'Thakral B', 'Loghavi S', 'Medeiros LJ', 'Wang W']","['Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, United States.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, United States.', ""Department of Pathology, Jimo People's Hospital, Qingdao, China."", 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, United States.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, United States.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, United States.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, United States.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, United States.

We compared outcomes of transplants in older patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) who received either HLA-matched unrelated donor (MUD) cells or haplo/cord grafts. Between 2007 and 2013, 109 adults ages 50 and older underwent similar reduced-intensity conditioning with fludarabine and melphalan and antibody-mediated T cell depletion for AML (n = 83) or high-risk MDS (n = 26) followed by either a MUD (n = 68) or haplo/cord (n = 41) graft. Patient characteristics were similar for each graft source except for more minority patients receiving a haplo/cord transplant (P = .01). One half of the AML patients were not in remission. Two-year progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and graft-versus-host disease-free relapse-free survival were 38%, 48%, and 32.1% for MUD and 33%, 48%, and 33.8% for haplo/cord transplants (P = .62 for PFS; P = .97 for OS; P= .84), respectively. Acute grades II to IV and chronic graft-versus-host-disease rates did not differ at 19.5% and 4.9% in haplo/cord compared with 25% and 7.4% after MUD (P = .53 and P = .62, respectively). Multivariate analysis confirmed no significant differences in transplant outcomes by donor type. Haplo/cord reduced-intensity transplantation achieves similar outcomes relative to MUD in older AML and MDS patients, making this a promising option for those without matched donors.","['Tsai, Stephanie B', 'Rhodes, Joanna', 'Liu, Hongtao', 'Shore, Tsiporah', 'Bishop, Michael', 'Cushing, Melissa M', 'Gergis, Usama', 'Godley, Lucy', 'Kline, Justin', 'Larson, Richard A', 'Mayer, Sebastian', 'Odenike, Olatoyosi', 'Stock, Wendy', 'Wickrema, Amittha', 'van Besien, Koen', 'Artz, Andrew S']","['Tsai SB', 'Rhodes J', 'Liu H', 'Shore T', 'Bishop M', 'Cushing MM', 'Gergis U', 'Godley L', 'Kline J', 'Larson RA', 'Mayer S', 'Odenike O', 'Stock W', 'Wickrema A', 'van Besien K', 'Artz AS']","['Section of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois; Section of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Medicine, Loyola University Medical Center, Maywood, Illinois.', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant Program, Weill-Cornell Medical College, New York, New York.', 'Section of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois.', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant Program, Weill-Cornell Medical College, New York, New York.', 'Section of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois.', 'Department of Pathology, Weill-Cornell Medical College, New York, New York.', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant Program, Weill-Cornell Medical College, New York, New York.', 'Section of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois.', 'Section of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois.', 'Section of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois.', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant Program, Weill-Cornell Medical College, New York, New York.', 'Section of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Medicine, Loyola University Medical Center, Maywood, Illinois.', 'Section of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois.', 'Section of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois.', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant Program, Weill-Cornell Medical College, New York, New York.', 'Section of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois.

However, the impact of BMI on survival in children undergoing HSCT is not well defined, with conflicting results being reported on this issue. We analyzed 855 patients age 2 to 20 years with diagnosis of acute leukemia who underwent umbilical cord blood transplantation (UCBT) from 1990 to 2015. Patients were classified according to BMI as normal (fifth to 85th percentile), underweight (less than fifth percentile), overweight (85th to 95th percentile), and obese (>95th percentile) using growth charts for age and sex. All patients received single-unit UCBT after a myeloablative conditioning regimen. Diagnosis was acute lymphoblastic leukemia in 68% of the patients. Sixty-one percent of patients (n = 523) were in the normal BMI category, 11% (n = 96) were underweight, 16% (n = 137) overweight, and 12% (n = 99) obese. The cumulative incidence of grade II to IV acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) was 35% (32% to 38%). According to pretransplantation BMI, aGVHD was 46% (33% to 59%) for underweight, 34% (31% to 42%) for normal, 36% (18% to 38%) for overweight, and 27% (15% to 37%) for obese (P = .04). In multivariate analysis, a BMI less than the fifth percentile was associated with higher incidence of acute grade II to IV GVHD compared with normal-BMI patients (hazard ratio, 1.61; 95% confidence interval, 1.15 to 2.26; P = .006). Our results show that being underweight at the time of transplantation is associated with an increased risk of aGVHD, highlighting the importance of nutritional status before UCBT.","['Paviglianiti, Annalisa', 'Dalle, Jean Hugues', 'Ayas, Mouhab', 'Boelens, Jan Jaap', 'Volt, Fernanda', 'Iori, Anna Paola', 'de Souza, Mair Pedro', 'Diaz, Miguel Angel', 'Michel, Gerard', 'Locatelli, Franco', 'Jubert, Charlotte', 'Yakoub-Agha, Ibrahim', 'Bittencourt, Henrique', 'Bertrand, Yves', 'Kenzey, Chantal', 'Tozatto Maio, Karina', 'Hayashi, Hiromi', 'Rocha, Vanderson', 'Bader, Peter', 'Gluckman, Eliane', 'Ruggeri, Annalisa']","['Paviglianiti A', 'Dalle JH', 'Ayas M', 'Boelens JJ', 'Volt F', 'Iori AP', 'de Souza MP', 'Diaz MA', 'Michel G', 'Locatelli F', 'Jubert C', 'Yakoub-Agha I', 'Bittencourt H', 'Bertrand Y', 'Kenzey C', 'Tozatto Maio K', 'Hayashi H', 'Rocha V', 'Bader P', 'Gluckman E', 'Ruggeri A']","['Eurocord, Hopital Saint Louis, Paris, France; Monacord, Centre Scientifique de Monaco, Monaco, Monaco.

Cytogenetic monitoring has a lower sensitivity, is expensive, and requires invasive bone marrow sampling. Nevertheless, chronic myeloid leukemia guidelines continue to recommend performing routine cytogenetic response assessments, even when adequate molecular diagnostics are available. METHODS: In a population-based registry of newly diagnosed CML patients in the Netherlands, all simultaneous cytogenetic and molecular assessments performed at 3, 6, and 12 months were identified and response of these matched assessments was classified according to European Leukemia Net (ELN) recommendations. The impact of discrepant cytogenetic and molecular response classifications and course of patients with additional chromosomal abnormalities were evaluated. RESULTS: The overall agreement of 200 matched assessments was 78%. In case of discordant responses, response at 24 months was consistently better predicted by the molecular outcome. Cytogenetic response assessments provided relevant additional clinical information only in some cases of molecular ""warning."" The development of additional cytogenetic abnormalities was always accompanied with molecular failure. CONCLUSION: We conclude that it is safe to omit routine cytogenetics for response assessment during treatment and to only use molecular monitoring, in order to prevent ambiguous classifications, reduce costs, and reduce the need for invasive bone marrow sampling. Cytogenetic re-assessment should still be performed when molecular response is suboptimal.","['Geelen, Inge G P', 'Thielen, Noortje', 'Janssen, Jeroen J W M', 'Hoogendoorn, Mels', 'Roosma, Tanja J A', 'Valk, Peter J M', 'Visser, Otto', 'Cornelissen, Jan J', 'Westerweel, Peter E']","['Geelen IGP', 'Thielen N', 'Janssen JJWM', 'Hoogendoorn M', 'Roosma TJA', 'Valk PJM', 'Visser O', 'Cornelissen JJ', 'Westerweel PE']","['Department of Hematology, Albert Schweitzer Hospital, Dordrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Diakonessenhuis, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Medical Center Leeuwarden, Leeuwarden, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Netherlands Comprehensive Cancer Organisation (IKNL), Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Albert Schweitzer Hospital, Dordrecht, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20180207,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,,['NOTNLM'],"['molecular cytogenetics', 'myeloproliferative neoplasms', 'philadelphia chromosome']",2017/12/31 06:00,2018/09/06 06:00,['2017/12/31 06:00'],"['2017/12/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/12/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/09/06 06:00 [medline]', '2017/12/31 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ejh.13023 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2018 Apr;100(4):367-371. doi: 10.1111/ejh.13023.

We found that C5aR interacted with its antagonist/agonist ribosomal protein S19 (RP S19) polymer or a RP S19 polymer functional analogue S-tagged C5a/RP S19, which connects an RP S19 C-terminus (IAGQVAAANKKH) to the S-tagged C5a C-terminus, promoted acute inflammation at the resolution phase via an activation of the apoptosis-inducing transcription factor delta lactoferrin (deltaLf) in neutrophils and the membrane mobilizing factor full-length annexin A3 (ANXA3) in macrophages. To confirm the antagonistic system of the recycling C5aR, S-tagged deltaLf-coupled BrCN-activated Sepharose 4B beads were incubated with cytoplasmic proteins and identified a neutrophil-specific deltaANXA3 via pull-down experiments. The S-tagged C5a/RP S19-induced agonistic functions in macrophage-like cells that were differentiated from human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells by phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate were suppressed by deltaLf and deltaANXA3 co-overexpression. deltaANXA3 seems to participate in the antagonistic system of the neutrophil C5aR involving IAGQVAAANKKH and deltaLf. Most likely, deltaANXA3 works as antagonist for the recycling C5aR on neutrophils during the resolution phase of acute inflammation.","['Yamanegi, Koji', 'Yamada, Naoko', 'Nakasho, Keiji', 'Nishiura, Hiroshi']","['Yamanegi K', 'Yamada N', 'Nakasho K', 'Nishiura H']","['Department of Pathology, Hyogo College of Medicine, Nishinomiya, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Hyogo College of Medicine, Nishinomiya, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20171229,Australia,Pathol Int,Pathology international,9431380,,['NOTNLM'],"['C5a receptor', 'delta annexin A3', 'delta lactoferrin', 'neutrophils', 'ribosomal protein S19']",2017/12/31 06:00,2018/10/26 06:00,['2017/12/31 06:00'],"['2017/05/03 00:00 [received]', '2017/11/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/12/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/26 06:00 [medline]', '2017/12/31 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/pin.12626 [doi]'],ppublish,Pathol Int. 2018 Feb;68(2):109-116. doi: 10.1111/pin.12626.

Clofarabine-based induction (CLO) provides an alternative to low-intensity therapy (LIT) and palliative care for this population, but supporting data are conflicted. Recently, our institution adopted the FLAG regimen (fludarabine, cytarabine, and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor) based on data reporting similar outcomes to CLO in elderly patients with AML unable to tolerate anthracycline-based induction. We retrospectively analyzed the efficacy and safety of patients >/= 60 years old with AML treated with FLAG or CLO over the past 10 years. We performed a propensity score match that provided 32 patients in each group. Patients treated with FLAG had a higher CR/CRi rate (65.6 vs. 37.5%, P = 0.045) and OS (7.9 vs. 2.8 months, P = 0.085) compared to CLO. Furthermore, FLAG was better tolerated with significantly less grade 3/4 toxicities and a shorter duration of neutropenia (18.5 vs. 30 days, P = 0.002). Finally, we performed a cost analysis that estimated savings to be $30,000-45,000 per induction with FLAG. Our study supports the use of FLAG both financially and as an effective, well-tolerated high-dose treatment regimen for elderly patients with AML. No cases of cerebellar neurotoxicity occurred.","['Scappaticci, Gianni B', 'Marini, Bernard L', 'Nachar, Victoria R', 'Uebel, James R', 'Vulaj, Vera', 'Crouch, Ashley', 'Bixby, Dale L', 'Talpaz, Moshe', 'Perissinotti, Anthony J']","['Scappaticci GB', 'Marini BL', 'Nachar VR', 'Uebel JR', 'Vulaj V', 'Crouch A', 'Bixby DL', 'Talpaz M', 'Perissinotti AJ']","['Department of Pharmacy Services and Clinical Sciences, Michigan Medicine and University of Michigan College of Pharmacy, 1500 East Medical Center Drive, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacy Services and Clinical Sciences, Michigan Medicine and University of Michigan College of Pharmacy, 1500 East Medical Center Drive, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacy Services and Clinical Sciences, Michigan Medicine and University of Michigan College of Pharmacy, 1500 East Medical Center Drive, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine and Division of Hematology and Oncology, Michigan Medicine and University of Michigan Medical School, 1500 East Medical Center Drive, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacy Services and Clinical Sciences, Michigan Medicine and University of Michigan College of Pharmacy, 1500 East Medical Center Drive, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine and Division of Hematology and Oncology, Michigan Medicine and University of Michigan Medical School, 1500 East Medical Center Drive, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine and Division of Hematology and Oncology, Michigan Medicine and University of Michigan Medical School, 1500 East Medical Center Drive, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine and Division of Hematology and Oncology, Michigan Medicine and University of Michigan Medical School, 1500 East Medical Center Drive, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacy Services and Clinical Sciences, Michigan Medicine and University of Michigan College of Pharmacy, 1500 East Medical Center Drive, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, USA. ajperis@med.umich.edu.', ', Ann Arbor, USA. ajperis@med.umich.edu.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20171229,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Clofarabine', 'Elderly patients', 'FLAG', 'Leukemia']",2017/12/31 06:00,2018/03/10 06:00,['2017/12/31 06:00'],"['2017/08/16 00:00 [received]', '2017/12/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/12/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/10 06:00 [medline]', '2017/12/31 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00277-017-3217-1 [doi]', '10.1007/s00277-017-3217-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2018 Apr;97(4):573-584. doi: 10.1007/s00277-017-3217-1.

Notch signaling is especially important to T cell development, and its deregulation leads to leukemia. Although not well characterized, it continues to play an integral role in peripheral T cells, in which a unique mode of Notch activation can occur. In contrast to canonical Notch activation initiated by adjacent ligand-expressing cells, TCR stimulation is sufficient to induce Notch signaling. However, the interactions between these two pathways have not been defined. In this article, we show that Notch activation occurs in peripheral T cells within a few hours post-TCR stimulation and is required for optimal T cell activation. Using a panel of inhibitors against components of the TCR signaling cascade, we demonstrate that Notch activation is facilitated through initiation of protein kinase C-induced ADAM activity. Moreover, our data suggest that internalization of Notch via endocytosis plays a role in this process. Although ligand-mediated Notch stimulation relies on mechanical pulling forces that disrupt the autoinhibitory domain of Notch, we hypothesized that, in T cells in the absence of ligands, these conformational changes are induced through chemical adjustments in the endosome, causing alleviation of autoinhibition and receptor activation. Thus, T cells may have evolved a unique method of Notch receptor activation, which is described for the first time, to our knowledge, in this article.","['Steinbuck, Martin Peter', 'Arakcheeva, Ksenia', 'Winandy, Susan']","['Steinbuck MP', 'Arakcheeva K', 'Winandy S']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Immunology Training Program, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA 02118.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Immunology Training Program, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA 02118.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Immunology Training Program, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA 02118 swinandy@bu.edu.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA104962/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA176811/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20171229,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,PMC5854196,,,2017/12/31 06:00,2018/10/03 06:00,['2017/12/31 06:00'],"['2017/01/13 00:00 [received]', '2017/11/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/12/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/03 06:00 [medline]', '2017/12/31 06:00 [entrez]']","['jimmunol.1700070 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1700070 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2018 Feb 1;200(3):997-1007. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1700070.

Immunotherapy with chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cells redirects a patient's immune cells against the tumour antigen. CAR-T cell therapy has demonstrated promise in treating patients with several haematological malignancies, including acute B-cell lymphoblastic leukaemia and B-cell lymphomas. CAR-T cell therapy for patients with other solid tumours is also being tested. Safety is an important consideration in CAR-T cell therapy given the potential for serious adverse events, including death. Previous reviews on CAR-T cell therapy have been limited in scope and methodology. Herein, we present a protocol for a systematic review to identify CAR-T cell interventional studies and examine the safety and efficacy of this therapy in patients with haematology malignancies and solid tumours. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will search MEDLINE, including In-Process and Epub Ahead of Print, EMBASE and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from 1946 to 22 February 2017. Studies will be screened by title, abstract and full text independently and in duplicate. Studies that report administering CAR-T cells of any chimeric antigen receptor construct targeting antigens in patients with haematological malignancies and solid tumours will be eligible for inclusion. Outcomes to be extracted will include complete response rate (primary outcome), overall response rate, overall survival, relapse and adverse events. A meta-analysis will be performed to synthesise the prevalence of outcomes reported as proportions with 95% CIs. The potential for bias within included studies will be assessed using a modified Institute of Health Economics tool. Heterogeneity of effect sizes will be determined using the Cochrane I (2) statistic. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The review findings will be submitted for peer-reviewed journal publication and presented at relevant conferences and scientific meetings to promote knowledge transfer.

The recent discovery of STAT3 mutations has shed light on the genetic basis of T-LGLL pathogenesis. However, the association of STAT3 mutational status with patients' clinical, histopathologic, and other laboratory features has not been thoroughly evaluated in T-LGLL. In this study, STAT3 mutations were identified in 18 of 36 patients with T-LGLL (50%), including Y640F (12/18, 66.7%), N647I (3/18, 16.7%), E638Q (1/18, 5.6%), I659L (1/18, 5.6%), and K657R (1/18, 5.6%). Interestingly, pure red cell aplasia was seen exclusively in T-LGLL patients without STAT3 mutations (6/15 in the wild-type STAT3 group versus 0/13 in the mutant STAT3 group; P = .02); these patients also were the only responders to T-LGLL therapy (mainly cyclophosphamide) in wild-type STAT3 group. Patients harboring STAT3 mutations were more prone to rheumatoid arthritis (4/13 versus 0/15 in the wild-type STAT3 group; P = .04), frequently requiring therapy for neutropenia/neutropenia-associated infections, and demonstrated good therapeutic responses to methotrexate. No significant differences were seen in complete blood count, flow cytometric immunophenotypic features, T-cell receptor gamma V-J rearrangement repertoire, and bone marrow biopsy morphology among the STAT3-mutation and wild-type groups other than significantly larger tumor burden in patients with STAT3 mutations. The distinct disease association and therapeutic responses observed in patients with mutant and wild-type STAT3 warrant further investigation to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. They also highlight the importance of identifying STAT3 mutational status in patients with T-LGLL, which may aid in clinical therapeutic choice.","['Shi, Min', 'He, Rong', 'Feldman, Andrew L', 'Viswanatha, David S', 'Jevremovic, Dragan', 'Chen, Dong', 'Morice, William G']","['Shi M', 'He R', 'Feldman AL', 'Viswanatha DS', 'Jevremovic D', 'Chen D', 'Morice WG']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905, USA.

This work detailed the antiproliferative action of marinobufagin on tumor and normal lines, investigate its mechanism on HL-60 leukemia cells and its toxic effects on Allium cepa meristematic cells. Initially, cytotoxic action was assessed by colorimetric assays. Next, HL-60 cells were analyzed by morphological and flow cytometry techniques and growing A. cepa roots were examined after 72h exposure. Marinobufagin presented high antiproliferative action against all human tumor lines [IC50 values ranging from 0.15 (leukemia) to 7.35 (larynx) muM] and it failed against human erythrocytes and murine lines. Human normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were up to 72.5-fold less sensitive [IC50: 10.88muM] to marinobufagin than HL-60 line, but DNA strand breaks were no detected. Leukemia treaded cells exhibited cell viability reduction, DNA fragmentation, phosphatidylserine externalization, binucleation, nuclear condensation and cytoplasmic vacuoles. Marinobufagin also reduced the growth of A. cepa roots (EC50: 7.5muM) and mitotic index, caused cell cycle arrest and chromosomal alterations (micronuclei, delays and C-metaphases) in meristematic cells. So, to find out partially targeted natural molecules on human leukemia cells, like marinobufagin, is an amazing and stimulating way to continue the battle against cancer.","['Machado, Katia da Conceicao', 'Sousa, Livia Queiroz de', 'Lima, Daisy Jereissati Barbosa', 'Soares, Bruno Marques', 'Cavalcanti, Bruno Coelho', ""Maranhao, Sarah Sant'Anna"", 'Noronha, Janaina da Costa de', 'Rodrigues, Domingos de Jesus', 'Militao, Gardenia Carmen Gadelha', 'Chaves, Mariana Helena', 'Vieira-Junior, Gerardo Magela', 'Pessoa, Claudia', 'Moraes, Manoel Odorico de', 'Sousa, Joao Marcelo de Castro E', 'Melo-Cavalcante, Ana Amelia de Carvalho', 'Ferreira, Paulo Michel Pinheiro']","['Machado KDC', 'Sousa LQ', 'Lima DJB', 'Soares BM', 'Cavalcanti BC', 'Maranhao SS', 'Noronha JDC', 'Rodrigues DJ', 'Militao GCG', 'Chaves MH', 'Vieira-Junior GM', 'Pessoa C', 'Moraes MO', 'Sousa JMCE', 'Melo-Cavalcante AAC', 'Ferreira PMP']","['Postgraduate Program in Pharmaceutical Sciences, Federal University of Piaui, Teresina, Brazil.', 'Postgraduate Program in Pharmaceutical Sciences, Federal University of Piaui, Teresina, Brazil.', 'Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, Federal University of Ceara, Fortaleza, Brazil.', 'Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, Federal University of Ceara, Fortaleza, Brazil.', 'Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, Federal University of Ceara, Fortaleza, Brazil.', 'Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, Federal University of Ceara, Fortaleza, Brazil.', 'Institute of Natural, Humanities and Social Sciences, Federal University of Mato Grosso, Sinop, Brazil.', 'Institute of Natural, Humanities and Social Sciences, Federal University of Mato Grosso, Sinop, Brazil.', 'Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, Federal University of Pernambuco, Recife, Brazil.', 'Department of Chemistry, Federal University of Piaui, Teresina, Brazil.', 'Department of Chemistry, Federal University of Piaui, Teresina, Brazil.', 'Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, Federal University of Ceara, Fortaleza, Brazil.', 'Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, Federal University of Ceara, Fortaleza, Brazil.', 'Postgraduate Program in Pharmaceutical Sciences, Federal University of Piaui, Teresina, Brazil; Department of Biological Sciences, Federal University of Piaui, Picos, Brazil.', 'Postgraduate Program in Pharmaceutical Sciences, Federal University of Piaui, Teresina, Brazil.', 'Postgraduate Program in Pharmaceutical Sciences, Federal University of Piaui, Teresina, Brazil; Department of Biophysics and Physiology, Laboratory of Experimental Cancerology, Federal University of Piaui, Teresina, Brazil.

Increasing evidence indicates that oncogenes and tumor suppressors regulate the Ca(2+) transport systems. Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) receptors (IP3Rs) are IP3-activated Ca(2+) release channels located on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). They play pivotal roles in the regulation of cell death and survival by controlling Ca(2+) transfer from the ER to mitochondria through mitochondria-associated ER membranes (MAMs). Optimal levels of Ca(2+) mobilization to mitochondria are necessary for mitochondrial bioenergetics, whereas excessive Ca(2+) flux into mitochondria causes loss of mitochondrial membrane integrity and apoptotic cell death. In addition to well-known functions on outer mitochondrial membranes, B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) family proteins are localized on the ER and regulate IP3Rs to control Ca(2+) transfer into mitochondria. Another regulatory protein of IP3R, IP3R-binding protein released with IP3 (IRBIT), cooperates with or counteracts the Bcl-2 family member depending on cellular states. Furthermore, several oncogenes and tumor suppressors, including Akt, K-Ras, phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML), BRCA1, and BRCA1 associated protein 1 (BAP1), are localized on the ER or at MAMs and negatively or positively regulate apoptotic cell death through interactions with IP3Rs and regulation of Ca(2+) dynamics. The remodeling of Ca(2+) signaling by oncogenes and tumor suppressors that interact with IP3Rs has fundamental roles in the pathology of cancers.","['Ando, Hideaki', 'Kawaai, Katsuhiro', 'Bonneau, Benjamin', 'Mikoshiba, Katsuhiko']","['Ando H', 'Kawaai K', 'Bonneau B', 'Mikoshiba K']","['Laboratory for Developmental Neurobiology, RIKEN Brain Science Institute, 2-1 Hirosawa, Wako, Saitama, 351-0198, Japan.

However, tumor cells often develop resistance to BET inhibitors, greatly limiting their therapeutic potential. To study the mechanism underlying the resistance of BET inhibitors in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells, we herein investigated the impact of BET inhibitor JQ1 on the gene expression of Bcl-2 family members by RNA sequencing analysis, and found that acute treatment with JQ1 triggered upregulation of Mcl-1 in HCCLM3 and BEL7402cell lines. This JQ1-triggered Mcl-1 upregulation was further confirmed by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and western blotting analysis, both at mRNA and protein levels. Inhibition of Mcl-1 by RNA interference dramatically enhanced JQ1-triggered caspase-3 activation, cleavage of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase and apoptotic cell death induction in multiple HCC cell lines. Moreover, JQ1 in combination with cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor flavopiridol at a subtoxic concentration that reduced expression of Mcl-1, triggered massive apoptotic cell death in HCCLM3 and BEL7402cell lines. Together, these data suggest that Mcl-1 is a major contributor to BET inhibitor-resistance in HCC cells, and that combining drugs capable of down-regulating Mcl-1 may promote therapeutic potential in human HCC.","['Zhang, Hua-Peng', 'Li, Gong-Quan', 'Zhang, Yi', 'Guo, Wen-Zhi', 'Zhang, Jia-Kai', 'Li, Jie', 'Lv, Jian-Feng', 'Zhang, Shui-Jun']","['Zhang HP', 'Li GQ', 'Zhang Y', 'Guo WZ', 'Zhang JK', 'Li J', 'Lv JF', 'Zhang SJ']","['Department of Hepatobiliary and Pancreatic Surgery, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan, China; Open and Key Laboratory of Hepatobiliary & Pancreatic Surgery and Digestive Organ Transplantation at Henan Universities, Zhengzhou, Henan, China; Henan Key Laboratory of Digestive Organ Transplantation, Zhengzhou, Henan, China; Zhengzhou Key Laboratory of Hepatobiliary & Pancreatic Diseases and Organ Transplantation, Zhengzhou, Henan, China.', 'Department of Hepatobiliary and Pancreatic Surgery, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan, China; Open and Key Laboratory of Hepatobiliary & Pancreatic Surgery and Digestive Organ Transplantation at Henan Universities, Zhengzhou, Henan, China; Henan Key Laboratory of Digestive Organ Transplantation, Zhengzhou, Henan, China; Zhengzhou Key Laboratory of Hepatobiliary & Pancreatic Diseases and Organ Transplantation, Zhengzhou, Henan, China.', 'Open and Key Laboratory of Hepatobiliary & Pancreatic Surgery and Digestive Organ Transplantation at Henan Universities, Zhengzhou, Henan, China; Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan, China.', 'Department of Hepatobiliary and Pancreatic Surgery, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan, China; Open and Key Laboratory of Hepatobiliary & Pancreatic Surgery and Digestive Organ Transplantation at Henan Universities, Zhengzhou, Henan, China; Henan Key Laboratory of Digestive Organ Transplantation, Zhengzhou, Henan, China; Zhengzhou Key Laboratory of Hepatobiliary & Pancreatic Diseases and Organ Transplantation, Zhengzhou, Henan, China.', 'Department of Hepatobiliary and Pancreatic Surgery, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan, China; Open and Key Laboratory of Hepatobiliary & Pancreatic Surgery and Digestive Organ Transplantation at Henan Universities, Zhengzhou, Henan, China; Henan Key Laboratory of Digestive Organ Transplantation, Zhengzhou, Henan, China; Zhengzhou Key Laboratory of Hepatobiliary & Pancreatic Diseases and Organ Transplantation, Zhengzhou, Henan, China.', 'Department of Hepatobiliary and Pancreatic Surgery, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan, China; Open and Key Laboratory of Hepatobiliary & Pancreatic Surgery and Digestive Organ Transplantation at Henan Universities, Zhengzhou, Henan, China; Henan Key Laboratory of Digestive Organ Transplantation, Zhengzhou, Henan, China; Zhengzhou Key Laboratory of Hepatobiliary & Pancreatic Diseases and Organ Transplantation, Zhengzhou, Henan, China.', 'Department of Hepatobiliary and Pancreatic Surgery, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan, China; Open and Key Laboratory of Hepatobiliary & Pancreatic Surgery and Digestive Organ Transplantation at Henan Universities, Zhengzhou, Henan, China; Henan Key Laboratory of Digestive Organ Transplantation, Zhengzhou, Henan, China; Zhengzhou Key Laboratory of Hepatobiliary & Pancreatic Diseases and Organ Transplantation, Zhengzhou, Henan, China.

This is the first reported case in Latvia; the patient did not discontinue the drug after the first adverse effects in the form of pleural effusions, which we speculate led only to partial reversion of the disease. CASE PRESENTATION: A 67-year-old white man with chronic myelogenous leukemia was treated with the dual Src and BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor dasatinib. After treatment with dasatinib he had multiple pleural effusions which were suspected to be caused by congestive heart failure. Later a transthoracic Doppler echocardiography and right-sided heart catheterization revealed severe pulmonary hypertension with pulmonary vascular resistance of 12 Wood units and mean pulmonary artery pressure of 53 mmHg. Computed tomography ruled out a possible pulmonary embolism; laboratory specific tests for human immunodeficiency virus, rheumatoid factor, and anti-nuclear antibodies were negative, and dasatinib-induced pulmonary arterial hypertension was diagnosed. A follow-up right-sided heart catheterization and 6-minute walk test done a month after the discontinuation of dasatinib showed significant improvement: mean pulmonary artery pressure of 34 mmHg and pulmonary vascular resistance of 4 Wood units. CONCLUSIONS: Patients should always be closely monitored when using dasatinib for a prolonged time. Dasatinib-induced pulmonary hypertension may be fully reversible after the therapy is suspended, but the key factors involved are still unclear and need to be further studied.","['Skride, Andris', 'Sablinskis, Matiss', 'Sablinskis, Kristaps', 'Lesina, Krista', 'Lejnieks, Aivars', 'Lejniece, Sandra']","['Skride A', 'Sablinskis M', 'Sablinskis K', 'Lesina K', 'Lejnieks A', 'Lejniece S']","['Riga Stradins University, Riga, Latvia.', 'Pauls Stradins Clinical University Hospital, Riga, Latvia.', 'Riga Stradins University, Riga, Latvia.', 'Riga Stradins University, Riga, Latvia.', 'Riga Stradins University, Riga, Latvia.', 'Riga East University Hospital, Riga, Latvia.', 'Riga Stradins University, Riga, Latvia.', 'Riga East University Hospital, Riga, Latvia.', 'Riga Stradins University, Riga, Latvia. lejniece@latnet.lv.', 'Riga East University Hospital, Riga, Latvia. lejniece@latnet.lv.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20171229,England,J Med Case Rep,Journal of medical case reports,101293382,PMC5747081,['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic myelogenous leukemia', 'Dasatinib', 'Pleural effusion', 'Pulmonary arterial hypertension']",2017/12/31 06:00,2018/08/08 06:00,['2017/12/31 06:00'],"['2017/05/01 00:00 [received]', '2017/11/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/12/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/12/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/08/08 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13256-017-1515-9 [doi]', '10.1186/s13256-017-1515-9 [pii]']",epublish,J Med Case Rep. 2017 Dec 29;11(1):362. doi: 10.1186/s13256-017-1515-9.,20180807,1,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Aged', '*Cardiac Catheterization', 'Dasatinib/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', '*Echocardiography, Doppler', 'Humans', 'Hypertension, Pulmonary/*chemically induced/physiopathology/rehabilitation/therapy', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Pleural Effusion', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Walk Test']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In total, 112 newly diagnosed patients in our center were enrolled in the study. Their clinical information was collected and the patients werefollowed over the course of the study. Flow cytometry was used to detect the expression of CD9. RESULTS: CD9 expression was more common in B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) and patients > 40 years old. CD9-positive patients exhibited a higher BCR-ABL fusion gene positive rate and higher neutrophil counts than CD9 negative patients (P= 0.004 and P= 0.004, respectively). Response to induction chemotherapy was not dependent on CD9 expression. CD9-positive patients had a lower 2-year overall survival rate than CD9-negative patients. CONCLUSION: CD9 expression predicts some clinical characteristics and indicates an unfavorable prognosis in ALL patients.","['Liang, Peiqi', 'Miao, Miao', 'Liu, Zhuogang', 'Wang, Hongtao', 'Jiang, Wei', 'Ma, Shiyu', 'Li, Chuan', 'Hu, Rong']","['Liang P', 'Miao M', 'Liu Z', 'Wang H', 'Jiang W', 'Ma S', 'Li C', 'Hu R']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Netherlands,Cancer Biomark,Cancer biomarkers : section A of Disease markers,101256509,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'CD9', 'clinical characteristics', 'prognosis']",2017/12/30 06:00,2018/09/01 06:00,['2017/12/30 06:00'],"['2017/12/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/09/01 06:00 [medline]', '2017/12/30 06:00 [entrez]']","['CBM170422 [pii]', '10.3233/CBM-170422 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Biomark. 2018;21(4):781-786. doi: 10.3233/CBM-170422.,20180831,4,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CD9 protein, human)', '0 (Tetraspanin 29)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/mortality/*pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Tetraspanin 29/analysis/*biosynthesis', 'Young Adult']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It possesses antileukemic activity and has been clinically utilized for the treatment of acute leukemia and lymphoma. Sodium periodate (NaIO4) was reacted with HT to produce five HT derivatives including four novel compounds. Their antiproliferative activity against HL-60 acute promyelocytic leukemia cells revealed that the presence of the C-5' methyl group enhances the antiproliferative activity because the IC50 values of the HT derivatives, including HT1 (5'-de-O-methylharringtonine), were at least 2000 times higher (>100 muM) than that of HT ( approximately 47 nM). In addition, an indirect competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (icELISA) using a monoclonal antibody against HT (mAb 1D2) revealed that these antiproliferative activities were related to their cellular uptake. These results indicated that esterification of HT1 at the C-4' carboxylic acid group may enhance the antiproliferative activity of HT.","['Sakamoto, Seiichi', 'Miyamoto, Tomofumi', 'Usui, Kazuteru', 'Tanaka, Hiroyuki', 'Morimoto, Satoshi']","['Sakamoto S', 'Miyamoto T', 'Usui K', 'Tanaka H', 'Morimoto S']","['Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kyushu University , 3-1-1 Maidashi, Higashi-ku, Fukuoka 812-8582, Japan.', 'Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kyushu University , 3-1-1 Maidashi, Higashi-ku, Fukuoka 812-8582, Japan.', 'Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kyushu University , 3-1-1 Maidashi, Higashi-ku, Fukuoka 812-8582, Japan.', 'Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kyushu University , 3-1-1 Maidashi, Higashi-ku, Fukuoka 812-8582, Japan.', 'Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kyushu University , 3-1-1 Maidashi, Higashi-ku, Fukuoka 812-8582, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20171229,United States,J Nat Prod,Journal of natural products,7906882,,,,2017/12/30 06:00,2019/06/18 06:00,['2017/12/30 06:00'],"['2017/12/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/18 06:00 [medline]', '2017/12/30 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/acs.jnatprod.7b00541 [doi]'],ppublish,J Nat Prod. 2018 Jan 26;81(1):34-40. doi: 10.1021/acs.jnatprod.7b00541.

The conventional cytogenetic study (CCS) has been the gold standard for more than five decades. However, FISH (Fluorescence in Situ Hybridization) testing has become a popular modality owing to its targeted approach and the ability to detect abnormalities in non-mitotic cells. We here aimed to compare the diagnostic yields of a FISH panel against CCS in HMs. Methods: Samples of bone marrow and peripheral blood for a total of 201 HMs were tested for specific gene rearrangements using multi-target FISH and the results were compared with those from CCS. Results: Exhibited a greater diagnostic yield with a positive result in 39.8% of the cases, as compared to 17.9% of cases detected by CCS. Cases of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) benefited the most by FISH testing, which identified chromosomal aberrations beyond the capacity of CCS. FISH was least beneficial in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) where the highest concordance with CCS was exhibited. Acute lymphocytic leukaemia (ALL) demonstrated greater benefit with CCS. In addition, we found the following abnormalities to be most prevalent in HMs by FISH panel testing: RUNX1 (21q22) amplification in ALL, deletion of D13S319/LAMP1 (13q14) in CLL, CKS1B (1q21) amplification in multiple myeloma and deletion of EGR1/RPS14 (5q31/5q32) in MDS, consistent with the literature. Conclusions: In conclusion, FISH was found to be advantageous in only a subset of HMs and cannot completely replace CCS. Utilization of the two modalities in conjunction or independently should depend on the indicated HM for an optimal approach to detecting chromosomal aberrations.","['Ashok, Vishal', 'Ranganathan, Ramya', 'Chander, Smitha', 'Damodar, Sharat', 'Bhat, Sunil', 'S, Nataraj K', 'A, Satish Kumar', 'Jadav, Sachin Suresh', 'Rajashekaraiah, Mahesh', 'T S, Sundareshan']","['Ashok V', 'Ranganathan R', 'Chander S', 'Damodar S', 'Bhat S', 'S NK', 'A SK', 'Jadav SS', 'Rajashekaraiah M', 'T S S']","['Department of Cytogenetics, Anand Diagnostic Laboratory, Bangalore, India.

This could have paramount implications for cancer diagnosis, gene treatments and other domains. Clustering may reveal natural structures and identify interesting patterns in underlying data. The main objective of this research was to derive a heuristic approach to detection of highly co-expressed genes related to cancer from gene expression data with minimum Mean Squared Error (MSE). Methods: A modified CSO algorithm using Harmony Search (MCSO-HS) for clustering cancer gene expression data was applied. Experiment results are analyzed using two cancer gene expression benchmark datasets, namely for leukaemia and for breast cancer. Result: The results indicated MCSO-HS to be better than HS and CSO, 13% and 9% with the leukaemia dataset. For breast cancer dataset improvement was by 22% and 17%, respectively, in terms of MSE. Conclusion: The results showed MCSO-HS to outperform HS and CSO with both benchmark datasets. To validate the clustering results, this work was tested with internal and external cluster validation indices. Also this work points to biological validation of clusters with gene ontology in terms of function, process and component.","['M, Pandi', 'R, Balamurugan', 'N, Sadhasivam']","['M P', 'R B', 'N S']","['Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Bannari Amman Institute of Technology, Sathyamangalam, Erode, India.

This study aimed to improve outcome in patients with ITR of B-cell ALL (B-ALL) occurring after 18 months of first clinical remission using intensive systemic chemotherapy and to decrease long-term sequelae by limiting use of testicular radiation. PROCEDURE: Forty patients in first ITR of B-ALL were enrolled. Induction (dexamethasone, vincristine, daunorubicin, and intrathecal triple therapy) was preceded by one dose of high-dose methotrexate (MTX, 5 g/m(2) ). Following induction, 25 of 26 patients who had persistent testicular enlargement underwent testicular biopsy. Eleven had biopsy-proven disease and received bilateral testicular radiation (24 Gy), whereas twenty-nine did not. RESULTS: Overall 5-year event-free survival (EFS)/OS was 65.0 +/- 8.8%/73.1 +/- 8.3%, with 5-year EFS 62.1 +/- 11.0% vs. 72.7 +/- 14.4% for patients who did not receive radiation therapy (XRT) (n = 29) compared with those who did (n = 11), respectively (P = 0.64). There were six second bone marrow relapses and six second ITRs. The proportion of second relapses was similar in the patients that received testicular radiation and those who did not.

We assessed the capacity of a physical therapy and motivation-based intervention, beginning after diagnosis and continuing through the end of treatment, to positively modify these factors. PROCEDURE: A 2.5-year randomized controlled trial of 73 patients aged 4-18.99 years within 10 days of ALL diagnosis assessed BMD at baseline (T(0) ) and end of therapy (T(3) ), strength, range of motion, endurance, motor skills, and HRQL at baseline (T(0) ), 8 (T(1) ), 15 (T(2) ), and 135 (T(3) ) weeks. RESULTS: There were no significant changes between groups (intervention, n = 33; usual care, n = 40) in BMD (P = 0.059) at T(3) or physical function and HRQL at T(0) -T(3) . While BMD declined in both the intervention (T(0) = -0.21, T(3) = -0.55) and usual care (T(0) = -0.62, T(3) = -0.78) groups, rates of decline did not differ between groups (P = 0.56). Univariate analysis (n = 73) showed associations of higher T(3) bone density with body mass index T(1) (P = 0.01), T(2) (P = <0.0001), T(3) (P = 0.01), T(3) ankle flexibility/strength (P = 0.001), and T(2) parent (P = 0.02)/T(0) child (P = 0.03) perceptions of less bodily pain. CONCLUSIONS: The intervention delivered during treatment was not successful in modifying BMD, physical function, or HRQL. Physical activity, at the level and intensity required to modify these factors, may not be feasible during early treatment owing to the child's responses to the disease and treatment. Future studies will consider intervention implementation during late maintenance therapy, extending into survivorship.","['Cox, Cheryl L', 'Zhu, Liang', 'Kaste, Sue C', 'Srivastava, Kumar', 'Barnes, Linda', 'Nathan, Paul C', 'Wells, Robert J', 'Ness, Kirsten K']","['Cox CL', 'Zhu L', 'Kaste SC', 'Srivastava K', 'Barnes L', 'Nathan PC', 'Wells RJ', 'Ness KK']","[""Department of Epidemiology and Cancer Control, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", 'Department of Biostatistics, The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, Houston, Texas.', ""Department of Epidemiology and Cancer Control, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", 'Department of Radiology, The University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, Tennessee.', ""Department of Epidemiology and Cancer Control, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Epidemiology and Cancer Control, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", 'The Hospital for Sick Children, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Division of Pediatrics-Unit 87, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', ""Department of Epidemiology and Cancer Control, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee.""]",['eng'],['R01 CA129384/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",20171229,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,PMC5821547,['NOTNLM'],"['*bone mineral density', '*health-related quality of life', '*late effects', '*pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*physical function']",2017/12/30 06:00,2019/04/25 06:00,['2017/12/30 06:00'],"['2017/08/17 00:00 [received]', '2017/11/09 00:00 [revised]', '2017/11/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/12/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/25 06:00 [medline]', '2017/12/30 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.26929 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2018 Apr;65(4). doi: 10.1002/pbc.26929.

Pediatric data on the epidemiology of acute kidney injury (AKI) in AML are limited. We report on the incidence of AKI in childhood AML and the risk factors associated with AKI episodes. METHODS: A retrospective cohort of 53 patients (</=18 years), with de novo AML, receiving chemotherapy over a 10-year period. All serum creatinine (SCr) levels during therapy-related hospitalizations were assessed to stage AKI episodes as per Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes criteria. Severe AKI was defined as AKI stages 2 or 3 and urine output criteria were not used. AKI risk factors were assessed independently in both cycle 1 alone and combining all chemotherapy cycles. RESULTS: AKI developed in 34 patients (64%) with multiple AKI episodes in 10 patients (46 total episodes). Twenty-four severe AKI episodes occurred in 23 patients (43.4%) with a mean duration of 26.1 days (SD 7.3). In cycle 1, hyperleukocytosis was not predictive of AKI, but severe sepsis was an independent risk factor of severe AKI (odds ratio [OR]: 13.4; 95% CI 1.9-94.9). With cycles combined, all subjects with AKI had severe sepsis and older age (>/=10 years) was associated with severe AKI (OR: 20.8; 95% CI 3.8-112.2). CONCLUSION: There was a high incidence of AKI in our AML cohort with a strong association with older age (>/=10 years) and severe sepsis. Larger prospective studies are needed to confirm the high burden of AKI and risk factors in this susceptible population.","['Du Plessis, Liezl', 'Rassekh, Shahrad Rod', 'Mammen, Cherry']","['Du Plessis L', 'Rassekh SR', 'Mammen C']","[""Division of Hematology/Oncology/Blood & Marrow Transplant, British Columbia Children's Hospital (BCCH), Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada."", ""Division of Hematology/Oncology/Blood & Marrow Transplant, British Columbia Children's Hospital (BCCH), Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada."", ""Division of Nephrology, British Columbia Children's Hospital (BCCH), Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.""]",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",20171229,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,['NOTNLM'],"['*AKI', '*chemotherapy', '*childhood acute myeloid leukemia']",2017/12/30 06:00,2019/04/25 06:00,['2017/12/30 06:00'],"['2017/09/20 00:00 [received]', '2017/11/02 00:00 [revised]', '2017/11/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/12/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/25 06:00 [medline]', '2017/12/30 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.26915 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2018 Apr;65(4). doi: 10.1002/pbc.26915.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study involved 283 children residents of Kyiv, Zhytomyr and Chernihiv regions. There were 90 acute leukemia patients(AL) (ALL - 56, AML - 34), and 193 people of comparison group with anemia, leukemoid reactions and lymphadenopathy. We analyzed the type of comorbid somatic pathology, diseases in the genealogy, hematological parameters, cortisol levels in blood serum and irradiation doses in all children. In patients with AL expected median survival was calculated. RESULTS: In 28.9 % of AL children the initial cortisol content was below 200 nmol/l, in 7.8 % - higher than 500 nmol/l (in the comparison group 10.4 % and 17.1 % respectively). Among AL patients with cortisol levels below 200 nmol/l were significantly less amount of persons with chronic bacterial infections and persistent viral infections (CMV, EBV) and in the genealogy of these children allergic reactions, endocrine pathology diagnosed more often compared with patients, whose hormone levels was higher than 200 nmol/l (p < 0.05). Distribution of children from control group by gradations of cortisol, age groups, defined somatic pathology and diseases in genealogy had no difference. It is shown, that lower initial blood serum cortisol level in ALL children correlates to a greater probability of relapse (Rs = -0,67). In patients with AML a direct correlation between cortisol level and median survival was detected (Rs = 0,79). Children radiation doses were ranging from 0.08 mSv to 14.9 mSv, and there were slightly higher among residents of Zhytomyr region (8.4 +/- 1.2 mSv) compared to other regions. However, these doses did not affect blood serum cortisol levels in children and the course of AL. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest the need for correction and individualization of corticosteroid doses for optimization of AL patients treatment.

Estab lishing the Academy was among the first steps of the independent Ukrainian government and aimed to provide a high level health care for population. It was extremely needed for the minimization of Chornobyl medical consequences. This choice was related to a growing recognition of the scientific research in fulfilling the capital ES, Cyrillicenter's mission - study of the effects of low dose radiation on human body and radiation protection of the exposed population.The Center entered the Academy as a potent insti tution. Director General Dr. Anatoly Romanenko and his first deputy prof. Oles Pyatak were lucky to concentrate in three institutes of the Center a talent ed workforce including director of the Institute of Clinical Radiology prof Volodymyr Bebeshko, director of the Institute of Epidemiology and Prophylaxis of radiation Injuries prof. Volodymyr Buzunov, director of the Institute of Experimental Radiology prof. Mikhail Rudnev. Drs. T. Azaren kova, S. Galkina, V. Boer, T. Treskunova were appointed as scientific secretaries. Dosimetry divi sion was headed by brilliant prof Ilya Likhtarev and his staff Drs. I. Los, V. Korzun, V. Repin, O. Pere voznikov, O. Bondarenko, V. Chumak and others.The Center met creation of the Academy with expe rienced research and clinical staff encountering 1587 members, including 272 research staff, 28 doctors of science and 98 PhDs, modern diagnostic and labo ratory equipment, 300 beds in clinical departments and construction of hospital and out patient hospi tal in Svyatoshin. Scientific staff included experi enced prof. I. Khomaziuk, prof. B. Prevarsky, prof. V. Zamostian, prof. P. Chayalo, prof. M. Omelya nets, prof. A. Prysyazhnyuk. Dr. A. Niagu, Dr. E. Stepanova, Dr. A.Chumak, Dr. V. Klymenko, Dr. D. Komarenko, M. Pilinska, L.Ovsiannikova, O. Pi rogova. were among the first academic supervisors in studies of Chornobyl health effects and got professor certificates in this new area. First PhD theses were successfully passed by Dr. E. Gorbov, and Dr. of Sciences - by Dr. D. Bazyka. Basics of future aca demic research directions were elaborated that time by Drs. O. Kovalenko, Zh. Minchenko, V. Talko, I. Holyavka, D. Belyi, D. Yakimenko, E. Mikhai lovska, V. Malyzhev, V. Sushko, A. Cheban, K. Lo ganovsky, K. Bruslova, I. Dyagil, T. Liubarets, O. Kucher, G. Chobotko, and others. Later the major ity of these studies formed a background for Chornobyl legislation, regulatory directives, pre sented as dissertations.A quarter of century passed. The Center as a part of the National Academy of Medical Sciences resisted the challenges and moved forward, was recognized worldwide and fulfilled its main mission - providing highly qualified health care to radiation exposed. Staff numbers decreased (1,091), but work amount has increased. Since 2000, new premises were installed - a hospital with the biggest in Ukraine outpatient clin ic, new laboratory facilities, the last of which was in troduced in 2013. The Academy became a national one and since 2011 the Center was recognized as a national research institution (NRCRM), staff mem bers received 3 State Awards of Ukraine in the Field of Science and Technology, numerous personal awards.During this period, NRCRM staff conducted and published priority research data on radiation risks and molecular mechanisms of leukemia, including chronic lymphocytic, myelodysplastic syndrome, multiple myeloma, thyroid cancer, breast cancer in Chornobyl accident cleanup workers. Studies of the mechanisms of non tumor pathology - cardio vascular, cerebrovascular, cognitive disorders are in process. Of high importance are studies of possible transgenerational effects of radiation. The devel oped new technologies and protocols for the advanced care of radiation exposed were intro duced to the general health care system, the addi tional departments of oncology and chemotherapy were equipped and started activities, databases of cancer cases in exposed population and separate groups of exposed were introduced, as well as an international database of radiation injuries. The Clinical and Epidemiological registry of the NRCRM is in function and developed. An adapta tion of research directions with a respect to the pathomorphosis of radiation induced diseases in the remote period after irradiation will continue.Performed complex studies of the effects of incorporation of 131I on the fetus and the next gen eration of experimental animals became important for understanding the mechanisms of formation of radiation effects. Introduction of new foodstuffs and supplements with radiation protective proper ties was of positive effect for population protection during the first years.In the area of dosimetry a substantial progress has been achieved in reconstruction of thyroid doses in the Ukrainian population, dosimetric passportisation of settlements, radiochemistry, the creation of new methods for reconstructive dosimetry for cleanup workers - SEAD, RADRUE, and ROCKVILLE. All developments are implemented to practice, tens of thousands of doses have been restored. International recognition has received for the method of in utero doses reconstruction. As editor in chief, I regard it successful to incorporate our bilingual edition <<Problems of Radiation Medicine and Radiobiology>> into the NCBI MedLine, SCOPUS and other data bases, that creates an unique opportunity to widely disseminate results of the Center's research.Strategies for the future. Ukraine belongs to countries with a priority development of nuclear energy. Even with the increase in the production of clean energy, there is no other way than the further deployment of a complete nuclear fuel cycle and energy industrial complex, the expansion of the nuclear technologies to all sectors of the economy.The main potential threats to radiation safety include the aging of the material base of the NPPs with the prolongation of the working life for nuclear reactors with the expired terms of exploitation; the existence of a <<nuclear legacy>> sites of the former USSR in the territories of enterprises for the extrac tion and processing of uranium ores. About 5,000 institutions and enterprises use more than 25,000 sources of ionizing radiation in general. The use of radiological technologies and sources of ionizing radiation in medicine is increasing, in particular the burden on patients and staff in invasive cardiac sur gery. This will require significant efforts from the NRCRM to ensure an adequate radiation protec tion of the population, taking into account the experience collected during the mitigation of health effects of Chornobyl. Radiological threats of malev olent use of nuclear technology hasn't be forgotten.The mission of the NRCRM is to expand basic research of the health effects of ionizing radiation, elaboration and implementation of the care and radiation protection of population. Background for future is paved by a successful implementation of a special program of medical and biophysical control of personnel during transformation of the Shelter object into an environmentally safe sys tem, the State social program of increasing safty, labor hygiene and environment for 2014-2018; many years of successful cooperation with the State Nuclear Regulatory Inspectorate, the Natio nal Commission for Radiation Protection, <<Ener goatom>> company, the relevant departments of the Ministry of Health, international organizations such as WHO, UNSCEAR, IAEA, IARC, the US National Cancer Institute, IRSN, Nagasaki, Hiroshima, Fukushima universities and others.From the editorial board I congratulate the staff of the Center with the twenty fifth anniversary of the Academy. I would like also to wish the National Academy of Medical Sciences of Ukraine new ad vances in medical science and practice, sustainabil ity, unity, development and worldwide recognition.","['Bazyka, D']",['Bazyka D'],"['State Institution <<National Research Center for Radiation Medicine of the National Academy of Medical Sciences of Ukraine>>, Melnykova str., 53, Kyiv, 04050, Ukraine.']","['eng', 'ukr']",,"['Editorial', 'Historical Article']",,Ukraine,Probl Radiac Med Radiobiol,Problemy radiatsiinoi medytsyny ta radiobiolohii,101560511,,['NOTNLM'],['*NRCRM'],2017/12/30 06:00,2019/07/05 06:00,['2017/12/30 06:00'],"['2017/07/05 00:00 [received]', '2017/12/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/12/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/05 06:00 [medline]']",['UDK [pii]'],ppublish,Probl Radiac Med Radiobiol. 2017 Dec;22:10-14.,20190704,,['0 (Radiation-Protective Agents)'],IM,"['Academies and Institutes/history/organization & administration/*trends', 'Acute Radiation Syndrome/history/physiopathology/*therapy', 'Biomedical Research/history/*trends', 'Cardiovascular Diseases/history/physiopathology/therapy', 'Chernobyl Nuclear Accident', 'History, 20th Century', 'History, 21st Century', 'Humans', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/history/physiopathology/therapy', 'Radiation Injuries/history/physiopathology/*therapy', 'Radiation Monitoring/history/methods', 'Radiation-Protective Agents/therapeutic use', 'Radiobiology/history/*trends', 'Radiometry/history/methods', 'Thyroid Neoplasms/history/physiopathology/therapy', 'Ukraine']",,['D.

Mutations in Toll like receptor 9 (TLR9) and myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MYD88) genes may lead to an abnormal immune response that may cause greater cell proliferation and thus alter an individual's susceptibility to haematological malignancies including CLL. Objective: This work was designed to study any association of the TLR9 (rs2066807C/G and rs187084T/C) and MYD88 (L265P) single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) with risk of CLL in Egyptians. Materials and methods: One hundred patients with CLL and 100 healthy controls from the Egyptian population were genotyped by the polymerase chain reaction/restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR/RFLP) method. Results: With TLR9 rs2066807C/G the CC genotype was more frequent in both control and patient groups while for TLR9 rs187084T/C the TT genotype was most common. There were no significant associations with CLL risk. With MYD88 (L265P) only the TT genotype was detected. Conclusion: Our preliminary data suggest that polymorphisms in the TLR9 and MYD88 genes may not contribute to CLL susceptibility. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first dealing with TLR9 and MYD88 gene polymorphisms in CLL patients. Further studies with larger sample size should be conducted to validate these results in the Egyptian population.","['Ali, Yasser B.M', 'Foad, Rasha M', 'Abdel-Wahed, Essam']","['Ali YB', 'Foad RM', 'Abdel-Wahed E']","['Molecular Biology Department, Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology Research Institute (GEBRI), University of Sadat City, Egypt.Email: Yasser.Ali@gebri.usc.edu.eg']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20171229,Thailand,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,101130625,PMC5980878,['NOTNLM'],"['*CLL', '*MYD88', '*TLR9', '*polymorphism', '*PCR/RFLP']",2017/12/30 06:00,2018/08/15 06:00,['2017/12/30 06:00'],"['2017/12/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/12/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/08/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.22034/APJCP.2017.18.12.3245 [doi]'],epublish,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2017 Dec 29;18(12):3245-3250. doi: 10.22034/APJCP.2017.18.12.3245.,20180814,12,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (MYD88 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Differentiation Factor 88)', '0 (TLR9 protein, human)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 9)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Egypt', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/epidemiology/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloid Differentiation Factor 88/*genetics', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Prognosis', 'Toll-Like Receptor 9/*genetics']",,['Creative Commons Attribution License'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There are current only limited data on related cutaneous manifestations. This study aimed to assess cutaneous lesions and their etiologies in a Thai group of FNP patients. Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted on 43 non-transplant febrile neutropenic patients with concurrent cutaneous lesions, as determined by dermatopathologic studies at Songklanagarind Hospital in Thailand over a five-year period. Results: The mean age was 39 years (SD: 18.8). Approximately 60% were male. The most common underlying disease was a hematologic neoplasm. Twenty-one of the participants had developed FNP within 7.5+/-8.7 days after presenting with skin lesions. Twenty-two participants had skin lesions 9.0+/-11.1 days after FNP diagnosis. Cutaneous manifestations were mostly in the form of multiple lesions (67.4%), of which the most common were nodular skin lesions (37.2%) presenting on the lower extremities of the body (58.1%). The dermatopathologic diagnoses included infections which were almost all fungal and leukemia cutis. The development of skin lesions after FNP proved to be a statistically significant risk factor for fungal infection (OR 8.13, P = 0.009), whereas age (over 40 years) proved to be a statistically significant protective factor (OR 0.20, P = 0.04). Conclusions: There are a variety of cutaneous manifestations in FNP, of which the most common were cutaneous nodular skin lesions in the lower extremities. The most frequent infection was fungal in patients under 40 who had developed skin lesions after FNP.","['Aiempanakit, Kumpol', 'Naorungroj, Surarit', 'Chiratikarnwong, Kanokphorn', 'Auepemkiate, Sauvarat', 'Apinantriyo, Benjawan']","['Aiempanakit K', 'Naorungroj S', 'Chiratikarnwong K', 'Auepemkiate S', 'Apinantriyo B']","['Division of Dermatology, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Prince of Songkla University, Hatyai, Songkhla, Thailand.

Cell viability was determined by propidium iodide (PI) exclusion method followed by flow cytometry. Our results showed that YT1 inhibited the cell viability and resulted in morphologic changes to the U937, HL60 and K562 cells, respectively. Among them, U937 cells were the most sensitive cell line. On the contrary, YT1 had no cytotoxic effects on human fetal skin fibroblast WS1 cells. Flow cytometric analysis indicated that YT1 induced G2/M phase arrest and apoptosis (subG1 population) in U937 cells. The presence of apoptotic bodies evidenced by DAPI staining and DNA fragmentation detected by agarose gel electrophoresis further supported the induction of apoptosis in the YT1treated U937 cells. Annexin V/PI staining of U937 cells confirmed that the early apoptotic event occurred after YT1 exposure. YT1 disrupted the mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsim) in a timedependent manner. YT1 increased the protein levels of Bax and Bak but decreased Bcl2 and Bid protein levels in U937 cells in a timedependent manner. In addition, YT1 stimulated the expression of cytochrome c and proteolytic activation of caspase3 and caspase9 after exposure to YT1 in U937 cells. In summary, YT1 suppressed the viability of U937 leukemia cells through the intrinsic apoptosis pathway.

Owing to its heterogeneity, AML is divided into classes associated with different treatment outcomes and specific gene expression profiles. Based on previous studies on AML, in this study, we designed and generated an AML-array containing 900 oligonucleotide probes complementary to human genes implicated in hematopoietic cell differentiation and maturation, proliferation, apoptosis and leukemic transformation. The AML-array was used to hybridize 118 samples from 33 patients with AML of the M1 and M2 subtypes of the French-AmericanBritish (FAB) classification and 15 healthy volunteers (HV). Rigorous analysis of the microarray data revealed that 83 genes were differentially expressed between the patients with AML and the HV, including genes not yet discussed in the context of AML pathogenesis. The most overexpressed genes in AML were STMN1, KITLG, CDK6, MCM5, KRAS, CEBPA, MYC, ANGPT1, SRGN, RPLP0, ENO1 and SET, whereas the most underexpressed genes were IFITM1, LTB, FCN1, BIRC3, LYZ, ADD3, S100A9, FCER1G, PTRPE, CD74 and TMSB4X. The overexpression of the CPA3 gene was specific for AML with mutated NPM1 and FLT3. Although the microarray-based method was insufficient to differentiate between any other AML subgroups, quantitative PCR approaches enabled us to identify 3 genes (ANXA3, S100A9 and WT1) whose expression can be used to discriminate between the 2 studied AML FAB subtypes. The expression levels of the ANXA3 and S100A9 genes were increased, whereas those of WT1 were decreased in the AML-M2 compared to the AML-M1 group. We also examined the association between the STMN1, CAT and ABL1 genes, and the FLT3 and NPM1 mutation status. FLT3+/NPM1- AML was associated with the highest expression of STMN1, and ABL1 was upregulated in FLT3+ AML and CAT in FLT3- AML, irrespectively of the NPM1 mutation status. Moreover, our results indicated that CAT and WT1 gene expression levels correlated with the response to therapy. CAT expression was highest in patients who remained longer under complete remission, whereas WT1 expression increased with treatment resistance. On the whole, this study demonstrates that the AML-array can potentially serve as a first-line screening tool, and may be helpful for the diagnosis of AML, whereas the differentiation between AML subgroups can be more successfully performed with PCR-based analysis of a few marker genes.","['Handschuh, Luiza', 'Kazmierczak, Maciej', 'Milewski, Marek C', 'Goralski, Michal', 'Luczak, Magdalena', 'Wojtaszewska, Marzena', 'Uszczynska-Ratajczak, Barbara', 'Lewandowski, Krzysztof', 'Komarnicki, Mieczyslaw', 'Figlerowicz, Marek']","['Handschuh L', 'Kazmierczak M', 'Milewski MC', 'Goralski M', 'Luczak M', 'Wojtaszewska M', 'Uszczynska-Ratajczak B', 'Lewandowski K', 'Komarnicki M', 'Figlerowicz M']","['European Center for Bioinformatics and Genomics, Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry, Polish Academy of Sciences, 61-704 Poznan, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Poznan University of Medical Sciences, 60-569 Poznan, Poland.', 'European Center for Bioinformatics and Genomics, Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry, Polish Academy of Sciences, 61-704 Poznan, Poland.', 'European Center for Bioinformatics and Genomics, Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry, Polish Academy of Sciences, 61-704 Poznan, Poland.', 'European Center for Bioinformatics and Genomics, Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry, Polish Academy of Sciences, 61-704 Poznan, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Poznan University of Medical Sciences, 60-569 Poznan, Poland.', 'European Center for Bioinformatics and Genomics, Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry, Polish Academy of Sciences, 61-704 Poznan, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Poznan University of Medical Sciences, 60-569 Poznan, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Poznan University of Medical Sciences, 60-569 Poznan, Poland.', 'European Center for Bioinformatics and Genomics, Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry, Polish Academy of Sciences, 61-704 Poznan, Poland.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20171228,Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,PMC5807040,,,2017/12/30 06:00,2018/09/01 06:00,['2017/12/30 06:00'],"['2017/09/21 00:00 [received]', '2017/12/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/12/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/09/01 06:00 [medline]', '2017/12/30 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.3892/ijo.2017.4233 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2018 Mar;52(3):656-678. doi: 10.3892/ijo.2017.4233.

Areas covered: The present review summarizes the current knowledge on the role of granulocyte transfusions and colony-stimulating factors as treatment strategy for hematologic patients with serious infectious complications. In addition, a survey among 21 hematologic centers, to evaluate the clinical practice for the use of G-CSF originator and biosimilars was performed. Expert commentary: Granulocyte transfusions with a target dose of at least 1.5-3 x 10(8) cells/kg, may be considered as an approach to bridge the gap between marrow suppression and recovery of granulocytes. G-CSF shortens the period of neutropenia, the hospitalization, the use of antibiotics and the rate of febrile neutropenia (FN) in adult and pediatric patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and in adults with acute myeloid leukemia where these advantages nevertheless, did not translate into a clinical benefit. G-CSF biosimilar showed equivalence or non-inferiority to filgrastim. There are no data supporting the use of GM-CSF, eltrombopag and erythropoietin for preventing or treating infectious complications in patients with hematologic disorders.","['Busca, Alessandro', 'Cesaro, Simone', 'Teofili, Luciana', 'Delia, Mario', 'Cattaneo, Chiara', 'Criscuolo, Marianna', 'Marchesi, Francesco', 'Fracchiolla, Nicola Stefano', 'Valentini, Caterina Giovanna', 'Farina, Francesca', 'Di Blasi, Roberta', 'Prezioso, Lucia', 'Spolzino, Angelica', 'Candoni, Anna', 'Del Principe, Maria Ilaria', 'Verga, Luisa', 'Nosari, Annamaria', 'Aversa, Franco', 'Pagano, Livio']","['Busca A', 'Cesaro S', 'Teofili L', 'Delia M', 'Cattaneo C', 'Criscuolo M', 'Marchesi F', 'Fracchiolla NS', 'Valentini CG', 'Farina F', 'Di Blasi R', 'Prezioso L', 'Spolzino A', 'Candoni A', 'Del Principe MI', 'Verga L', 'Nosari A', 'Aversa F', 'Pagano L']","[""a SSD Trapianto Cellule Staminali, A.O.U.

SDS affects several organs causing bone marrow failure, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, skeletal malformations, and cognitive disorders. About 15% of SDS patients develop myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and are at higher risk of developing acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Deficiency in SBDS expression has been associated with increased apoptosis and lack of myeloid differentiation in bone marrow hematopoietic progenitors. Importantly, most SDS patients carry nonsense mutations in SBDS. Since ataluren is a well-characterized small molecule inhibitor that can suppress nonsense mutations, here, we have assessed the efficacy of this drug in restoring SBDS expression in hematopoietic cells obtained from a cohort of SDS patients. Remarkably, we show that ataluren treatment readily restores SBDS protein expression in different cell types, particularly bone marrow stem cells. Furthermore, ataluren promotes myeloid differentiation in hematopoietic progenitors, reduces apoptotic rate in primary PBMCs, and brings mammalian target of rapamycin phosphorylation levels back to normal in both lymphoblasts and bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells (BM-MSCs). Since a specific therapy against SDS is currently lacking, these results provide the rationale for ataluren repurposing clinical trials.","['Bezzerri, Valentino', 'Bardelli, Donatella', 'Morini, Jacopo', 'Vella, Antonio', 'Cesaro, Simone', 'Sorio, Claudio', 'Biondi, Andrea', 'Danesino, Cesare', 'Farruggia, Piero', 'Assael, Baroukh Maurice', ""D'amico, Giovanna"", 'Cipolli, Marco']","['Bezzerri V', 'Bardelli D', 'Morini J', 'Vella A', 'Cesaro S', 'Sorio C', 'Biondi A', 'Danesino C', 'Farruggia P', 'Assael BM', ""D'amico G"", 'Cipolli M']","['Department of Medicine, University of Verona, Italy.', 'Unit of Immunology and Immunotherapy, Centro Ricerca Tettamanti, Pediatric Department, University of Milano Bicocca, Fondazione MBBM, Italy.', 'Department of Physics, University of Pavia, Italy.', 'Unit of Immunology, Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Integrata di Verona, Italy.', 'Unit of Pediatric Hematology Oncology, Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Integrata di Verona, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Verona, Italy.', 'School of Medicine and Surgery, University of Milano-Bicocca, Italy.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, University of Pavia, Italy.', 'Department of Oncology, ARNAS Ospedale Civico Palermo, Italy.', 'Department of Pulmonology, Adult CF center, IRCCS Fondazione Ca Granda, Policlinico Milano, Italy.', 'Unit of Immunology and Immunotherapy, Centro Ricerca Tettamanti, Pediatric Department, University of Milano Bicocca, Fondazione MBBM, Italy.', 'Cystic Fibrosis Center, Azienda Ospedaliero Universitaria Ospedali Riuniti, Ancona, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180209,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,,,,2017/12/30 06:00,2019/05/06 06:00,['2017/12/30 06:00'],"['2017/12/11 00:00 [received]', '2017/12/21 00:00 [revised]', '2017/12/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/12/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/06 06:00 [medline]', '2017/12/30 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.25025 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2018 Aug;93(4):527-536. doi: 10.1002/ajh.25025.

The discovery of FLT3 pathway and its potential role in leukemogenesis has generated excitement in the field and has provided a potential target for drug development. Despite setbacks encountered with first-generation inhibitors, we are witnessing an outbreak of novel agents with potent activity and improved pharmacodynamics which continue to generate promising results. The disease, however, remains a challenge to both patients and physicians with rapid emergence of resistance and subsequent treatment failure. Multiple unanswered questions remain as to which are the optimal FLT3-inhibitors and which strategies and combinations are likely to overcome resistance. This review revisits the development of FLT3-inhibitors, the pathways incriminated in their failure and summarizes available molecularly-designed strategies to design better clinical trials.","['Assi, Rita', 'Ravandi, Farhad']","['Assi R', 'Ravandi F']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20180125,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,,,,2017/12/30 06:00,2019/05/06 06:00,['2017/12/30 06:00'],"['2017/10/23 00:00 [received]', '2017/12/21 00:00 [revised]', '2017/12/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/12/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/06 06:00 [medline]', '2017/12/30 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.25027 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2018 Aug;93(4):553-563. doi: 10.1002/ajh.25027.

The bone marrow pathologic, cytogenetic, and molecular features of blast phase have not been well characterized. In this study, we reviewed 422 PV patients over a period of 11 years and identified 58 patients who developed acute myeloid leukemia (blast phase) during the course of disease. We found that blast phase of PV was characterized by overt myelodysplasia (n = 51, 88%); moderate to severe myelofibrosis (33 of 45, 73%); an abnormal karyotype (n = 51, 88%) that was often complex karyotype (n = 42, 72%); and gene mutations involving TP53 (55%), TET2 (27%), and DNMT3A (25%). Patients with blast phase of PV had an aggressive clinical course, with a median overall survival of 4 months after onset of blast phase. Eleven patients had close follow-up from polycythemic phase to blast phase: Four patients showed dysplastic changes in the polycythemic phase, and three of them transformed to blast phase without a ""middle phase"" of post-PV myelofibrosis.We conclude that blast phase of PV is characterized by myelodysplasia, moderate to severe fibrosis, a high frequency of an abnormal and often complex karyotype, and frequentTP53mutation.","['Hidalgo Lopez, Juliana E', 'Carballo-Zarate, Adrian', 'Verstovsek, Srdan', 'Wang, Sa A', 'Hu, Shimin', 'Li, Shaoying', 'Xu, Jie', 'Zuo, Wenli', 'Tang, Zhenya', 'Yin, C Cameron', 'Medeiros, L Jeffrey', 'Bueso-Ramos, Carlos E', 'Tang, Guilin']","['Hidalgo Lopez JE', 'Carballo-Zarate A', 'Verstovsek S', 'Wang SA', 'Hu S', 'Li S', 'Xu J', 'Zuo W', 'Tang Z', 'Yin CC', 'Medeiros LJ', 'Bueso-Ramos CE', 'Tang G']","['Department of Hematopathology, Unit 0072, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Blvd, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, Unit 0072, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Blvd, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, Unit 0072, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Blvd, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, Unit 0072, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Blvd, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, Unit 0072, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Blvd, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, Unit 0072, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Blvd, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, Unit 0072, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Blvd, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, Unit 0072, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Blvd, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, Unit 0072, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Blvd, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, Unit 0072, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Blvd, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, Unit 0072, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Blvd, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, Unit 0072, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Blvd, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.

In the case where the available personalized data are not sufficient to fully determine the parameter values, an appropriate prediction task may be followed. This study, a hybrid combination of computational optimization and machine learning methods with an already developed mechanistic model called the acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) Oncosimulator which simulates ALL progression and treatment response is presented. These methods are used in order for the parameters of the model to be estimated for retrospective cases and to be predicted for prospective ones. The parameter value prediction is based on a regression model trained on retrospective cases. The proposed Hybrid ALL Oncosimulator system has been evaluated when predicting the pre-phase treatment outcome in ALL. This has been correctly achieved for a significant percentage of patient cases tested (approx. 70% of patients). Moreover, the system is capable of denying the classification of cases for which the results are not trustworthy enough. In that case, potentially misleading predictions for a number of patients are avoided, while the classification accuracy for the remaining patient cases further increases. The results obtained are particularly encouraging regarding the soundness of the proposed methodologies and their relevance to the process of achieving clinical applicability of the proposed Hybrid ALL Oncosimulator system and VPH models in general.","['Ouzounoglou, Eleftherios', 'Kolokotroni, Eleni', 'Stanulla, Martin', 'Stamatakos, Georgios S']","['Ouzounoglou E', 'Kolokotroni E', 'Stanulla M', 'Stamatakos GS']","['In Silico Oncology and In Silico Medicine Group, Institute of Communication and Computer Systems, National Technical University of Athens, Athens, Greece.', 'In Silico Oncology and In Silico Medicine Group, Institute of Communication and Computer Systems, National Technical University of Athens, Athens, Greece.', 'Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'In Silico Oncology and In Silico Medicine Group, Institute of Communication and Computer Systems, National Technical University of Athens, Athens, Greece.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20171215,England,Interface Focus,Interface focus,101531990,PMC5740218,['NOTNLM'],"['acute lymphoblastic leukaemia', 'machine learning methods', 'multiscale modelling', 'oncosimulator', 'prednisone response prediction', 'simulation model']",2017/12/30 06:00,2017/12/30 06:01,['2017/12/30 06:00'],"['2017/12/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/12/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/30 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1098/rsfs.2016.0163 [doi]', 'rsfs20160163 [pii]']",ppublish,Interface Focus. 2018 Feb 6;8(1):20160163. doi: 10.1098/rsfs.2016.0163.

FLT3-ITD expressing cells express elevated levels of NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4)-generated pro-survival hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) contributing to increased levels of DNA oxidation and double strand breaks. NOX4 is constitutively active and has been found to have various isoforms expressed at multiple locations within a cell. The purpose of this study was to investigate the expression, localisation and regulation of NOX4 28 kDa splice variant, NOX4D. NOX4D has previously been shown to localise to the nucleus and nucleolus in various cell types and is implicated in the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and DNA damage. Here, we demonstrate that FLT3-ITD expressing-AML patient samples as well as -cell lines express the NOX4D isoform resulting in elevated H2O2 levels compared to FLT3-WT expressing cells, as quantified by flow cytometry. Cell fractionation indicated that NOX4D is nuclear membrane-localised in FLT3-ITD expressing cells. Treatment of MV4-11 cells with receptor trafficking inhibitors, tunicamycin and brefeldin A, resulted in deglycosylation of NOX4 and NOX4D. Inhibition of the FLT3 receptor revealed that the FLT3-ITD oncogene is responsible for the production of NOX4D-generated H2O2 in AML. We found that inhibition of the PI3K/AKT and STAT5 pathways resulted in down-regulation of NOX4D-generated pro-survival ROS. Taken together these findings indicate that nuclear membrane-localised NOX4D-generated pro-survival H2O2 may be contributing to genetic instability in FLT3-ITD expressing AML.","['Moloney, Jennifer N', 'Jayavelu, Ashok Kumar', 'Stanicka, Joanna', 'Roche, Sarah L', ""O'Brien, Rebecca L"", 'Scholl, Sebastian', 'Bohmer, Frank-D', 'Cotter, Thomas G']","['Moloney JN', 'Jayavelu AK', 'Stanicka J', 'Roche SL', ""O'Brien RL"", 'Scholl S', 'Bohmer FD', 'Cotter TG']","['Tumour Biology Laboratory, School of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Bioscience Research Institute, University College Cork, Cork, Ireland.', 'Institute of Molecular Cell Biology, CMB, Jena University Hospital, Jena, Germany.', 'Current address: Department of Proteomics and Signal Transduction, Max-Planck Institute of Biochemistry, Martinsried, Germany.', 'Tumour Biology Laboratory, School of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Bioscience Research Institute, University College Cork, Cork, Ireland.', 'Tumour Biology Laboratory, School of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Bioscience Research Institute, University College Cork, Cork, Ireland.', 'Tumour Biology Laboratory, School of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Bioscience Research Institute, University College Cork, Cork, Ireland.', 'Department of Haematology/Oncology, Clinic for Internal Medicine II, Jena University Hospital, Jena, Germany.', 'Institute of Molecular Cell Biology, CMB, Jena University Hospital, Jena, Germany.', 'Tumour Biology Laboratory, School of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Bioscience Research Institute, University College Cork, Cork, Ireland.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20171101,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,PMC5739649,['NOTNLM'],"['FLT3-ITD', 'NOX4 splice variant D/NOX4D 28 kDa', 'acute myeloid leukaemia', 'nuclear membrane', 'pro-survival reactive oxygen species']",2017/12/30 06:00,2017/12/30 06:01,['2017/12/30 06:00'],"['2017/07/27 00:00 [received]', '2017/10/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/12/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/12/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/30 06:01 [medline]']","['10.18632/oncotarget.22241 [doi]', '22241 [pii]']",epublish,Oncotarget. 2017 Nov 1;8(62):105440-105457. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.22241. eCollection 2017 Dec 1.,,62,,,,,,"['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST The authors declare that they have no conflicts of', 'interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Within the standard-risk group, more CD20-negative than CD20-positive patients achieved CR (100% vs. 83.3%, P=0.003) and durable CR1 (100% vs. 82.4%, P=0.014). For patients in the CD20-negative standard-risk, CD20-positive standard-risk, CD20-negative high-risk, and CD20-positive high-risk groups, the 3-year cumulative incidence of relapse was 42.6%, 70.0%, 59.3%, and 69.5%, respectively (P=0.118); the 3-year disease-free survival rates were 52.1%, 0%, 20.7%, and 13.7%, respectively (P=0.006); and the 3-year overall survival rates were 55.8%, 13.8%, 23.6%, and 16.9%, respectively (P=0.006). Our results suggest that patients with CD20-negative standard-risk B cell precursor-ALL have favorable prognosis compared with CD20-positive standard-risk or CD20-negative or -positive high-risk patients. CD20-positive standard-risk ALL patients may need other therapeutic modalities bridging to allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.","['Yang, ShenMiao', 'Wang, Jing', 'Zhao, Ting', 'Jia, JinSong', 'Zhu, HongHu', 'Jiang, Hao', 'Lu, Jin', 'Jiang, Bin', 'Shi, HongXia', 'Liu, YanRong', 'Lai, YueYun', 'Xu, LanPing', 'Huang, XiaoJun', 'Jiang, Qian']","['Yang S', 'Wang J', 'Zhao T', 'Jia J', 'Zhu H', 'Jiang H', 'Lu J', 'Jiang B', 'Shi H', 'Liu Y', 'Lai Y', 'Xu L', 'Huang X', 'Jiang Q']","[""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing, China."", 'Peking Tsinghua Center for Life Sciences, Academy for Advanced Interdisciplinary Studies, Peking University, Beijing, China.', ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing, China.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20171031,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,PMC5739646,['NOTNLM'],"['B cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'CD20', 'Ph-negative', 'adult']",2017/12/30 06:00,2017/12/30 06:01,['2017/12/30 06:00'],"['2017/06/12 00:00 [received]', '2017/09/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/12/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/12/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/30 06:01 [medline]']","['10.18632/oncotarget.22207 [doi]', '22207 [pii]']",epublish,Oncotarget. 2017 Oct 31;8(62):105397-105406. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.22207. eCollection 2017 Dec 1.,,62,,,,,,"['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST The authors declare that they have no conflicts of', 'interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we assess the effects of five polyphenols when used alone and in combination with antimetabolites: methotrexate, 6-mercaptopurine and 5-fluorouracil; in lymphoid and myeloid leukemia cells lines, and non-tumor control cells. The effects of combined treatments were investigated on ATP and glutathione levels, cell-cycle progression, DNA damage and apoptosis. Polyphenols antagonized methotrexate and 6-mercaptopurine induced cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis in most leukemia cell lines. This was associated with reduced DNA damage and increased glutathione levels, greater than that seen following individual treatments alone. In contrast, 5-fluorouracil when combined with quercetin, apigenin and rhein caused synergistic decrease in ATP levels, induction of cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis in some leukemia cell lines. However, antagonistic effects were observed when 5-fluorouracil was combined with rhein and cis-stilbene in myeloid cell lines. The effects were dependant on polyphenol type and chemotherapy agent investigated, and cell type treated. Interestingly treatment of non-tumor control cells with polyphenols protected cells from antimetabolite treatments. This suggests that polyphenols modulate the action of antimetabolite agents; more importantly they antagonized methotrexate and 6-mercaptopurine actions, thus suggesting the requirement of polyphenol-exclusion during their use.","['Mahbub, Amani', 'Le Maitre, Christine', 'Haywood-Small, Sarah', 'Cross, Neil', 'Jordan-Mahy, Nicola']","['Mahbub A', 'Le Maitre C', 'Haywood-Small S', 'Cross N', 'Jordan-Mahy N']","['Laboratory Medicine College, Pathology Department, Umm Al Qura University, Makkah, Saudi Arabia.', 'Biomolecular Sciences Research Center, Sheffield Hallam University, Sheffield, UK.', 'Biomolecular Sciences Research Center, Sheffield Hallam University, Sheffield, UK.', 'Biomolecular Sciences Research Center, Sheffield Hallam University, Sheffield, UK.', 'Biomolecular Sciences Research Center, Sheffield Hallam University, Sheffield, UK.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20170824,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,PMC5739607,['NOTNLM'],"['5-fluorouracil', '6-mercaptopurine', 'leukemia', 'methotrexate', 'polyphenols']",2017/12/30 06:00,2017/12/30 06:01,['2017/12/30 06:00'],"['2016/11/22 00:00 [received]', '2017/08/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/12/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/12/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/30 06:01 [medline]']","['10.18632/oncotarget.20501 [doi]', '20501 [pii]']",epublish,Oncotarget. 2017 Aug 24;8(62):104877-104893. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.20501. eCollection 2017 Dec 1.,,62,,,,,,"['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST The authors declare no conflicts of interest for this', 'submission.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The miRNA expression dataset GSE62137 and mRNA expression dataset GSE22529 were downloaded from National Center of Biotechnology Information Gene Expression Omnibus database. In CLL samples compared with normal B cell samples, differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs) were identified via the GEO2R instrument of GEO and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were obtained via the limma package of R. Functional enrichment analysis of the DEGs was performed via the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery. The targets of the DEMs were identified based on the miRNAWalk platform. The overlaps between the DEGs and the targets of the DEMs were selected, and the miRNA-Gene regulatory network was constructed based on the overlaps and the corresponding DEMs. A total of 63 DEMs and 504 DEGs were identified in CLL samples compared with normal B cell samples. Eleven enriched functional clusters of the DEGs were obtained. 405 miRNA-Gene regulatory pairs were identified. The miRNA-Gene regulatory pairs contained 351 target genes of the DEMs, including 9 overlaps with the DEGs. A miRNA-Gene regulatory network was constructed. Bioinformatics methods could help us develop a better understanding of the molecular mechanism of CLL. MiRNAs may play a critical role in regulating the process of CLL. They may affect CLL by regulating the processes of immunoreactivity and protein degradation. Genes such as Neurogenic Locus Notch Homolog Protein 2, PR/SET domain 4 and A-kinase anchoring protein 12 may be their regulating targets in CLL.","['Li, Jie', 'Qin, Yi', 'Zhang, Haiyan']","['Li J', 'Qin Y', 'Zhang H']","['Department of Transfusion Medicine, The Fifth Central Hospital of Tianjin, Tianjin 300450, P.R.

Information is summarized from earlier case reports and incidences of SR in ALL, to identify common patterns. Furthermore, the phenomenon of SR is compared with another disease variant of ALL, termed prodromal or preceding-ALL (pre-ALL). SR and the aleukemic phase in pre-ALL are associated with fever and/or sepsis and have similar kinetics and epidemiology. Therefore, pre-ALL not only closely resembles SR in ALL, but both conditions may represent a single disease entity. Production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and immune cell effects may induce temporary remission of ALL and the suppression of hematopoiesis. In contrast to SR in other types of cancer, all documented cases of SR in ALL were only transient. However, the disease can still be effectively treated with standard ALL therapies following relapse.","['Hores, Timm', 'Wendelin, Knut', 'Schaefer-Eckart, Kerstin']","['Hores T', 'Wendelin K', 'Schaefer-Eckart K']","['Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Paracelsus Medical University, D-90419 Nuremberg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Paracelsus Medical University, D-90419 Nuremberg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Paracelsus Medical University, D-90419 Nuremberg, Germany.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20171030,Greece,Oncol Lett,Oncology letters,101531236,PMC5738709,['NOTNLM'],"['acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'case report', 'pancytopenia', 'sepsis', 'spontaneous remission']",2017/12/30 06:00,2017/12/30 06:01,['2017/12/30 06:00'],"['2017/05/03 00:00 [received]', '2017/08/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/12/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/12/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/30 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3892/ol.2017.7288 [doi]', 'OL-0-0-7288 [pii]']",ppublish,Oncol Lett. 2018 Jan;15(1):115-120. doi: 10.3892/ol.2017.7288.

Deregulation of TFs expression and activity is often occurs in malignant B cells. The aim of this study was to evaluate TFs expression in chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells taking into consideration CD150 cell surface expression. From other side we attempted to regulate TFs expression via CD150 and CD180 cell surface receptors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Studies were performed on normal peripheral blood B-cell subpopulations and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells isolated from peripheral blood of 67 primary untreated patients with CLL. Evaluation of TFs expression was performed on mRNA level using qRT-PCR and on protein level by western blot analysis. RESULTS: Median of PAX5 and EBF1 mRNA expression was higher in cell surface CD150 positive (csCD150(+)) compared to csCD150(-) CLL cases or normal CD19(+) and CD19(+)CD5(+) B-cell subsets. Differences in mRNA expression of IRF8, IRF4 and BLIMP1 between studied groups of CLL and normal B cells were not revealed. All CLL cases were characterized by downregulated expression of PU.1 and BCL6 mRNAs in comparison to normal B cells. At the same time elevated SPIB mRNA expression level was restricted to CLL cells. Protein expression of IRF4, IRF8 and BCL6 was uniformly distributed between csCD150(-) and csCD150(+) CLL cases. PU.1 protein and CD20 that is direct PU.1 target gene positively correlated with CD150 cell surface expression on CLL cells. Ligation of CD150 and CD180 alone or in combination upregulated IRF8 and PU.1 while downregulated the IRF4 mRNA expression. Signaling via CD150 or CD180 alone elevated the level of BCL6 mRNA. Strong downregulation of IRF4 mRNA was observed after CD150, CD180 or CD150 andCD180 coligation on CLL cells. We found that in CLL cells CD150 is a negative regulator of SPIB while CD180 is involved in upregulation of EBF1 expression level. Moreover, CD180 ligation on CLL cells caused increase of CD150 mRNA level that is a one of the EBF1 target genes. CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of TFs expression profile revealed upregulated SPIB mRNA level and downregulated PU.1 in CLL cells. CD150 and CD180 receptors may modulate transcriptional program in CLL cells by regulating the TFs expression levels.","['Gordiienko, I', 'Shlapatska, L', 'Kholodniuk, V M', 'Kovalevska, L', 'Ivanivskaya, T S', 'Sidorenko, S P']","['Gordiienko I', 'Shlapatska L', 'Kholodniuk VM', 'Kovalevska L', 'Ivanivskaya TS', 'Sidorenko SP']","['Department of Molecular and Cellular Pathobiology, R.E.

RESULTS: We have shown that the TGFB - SMAD canonical pathway is not active in CLL cells. SMAD-responsive genes, such as BCL2L1 (BCL-XL), CCND2 (Cyclin D2), and MYC, are down-regulated in CLL cells compared with peripheral blood B cells of healthy donors. CONCLUSIONS: The TGFB-mediated signaling is not active in CLL cells due to low (or absent) expression of SMAD1, -4, -5, -9, and ATF-3.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 81 adult AL patients (38 males and 43 females with the age of 16-59 years) were studied. The patients were divided into two groups: group I (n = 34), AL patients treated with chemotherapy (CT) and L-arginine hydrochloride; group II (n = 47) - AL patients treated with CT only. Cardiac evaluation and endothelial function assessment were performed at baseline and after second CT. Electrocardiography (ECG) parameters, lipid peroxidation activity, antioxidant protection and NO system state were evaluated. RESULTS: The bioelectric activity abnormalities of the myocardium were observed in studied patients with low cardiac risk after induction CT. In case of L-arginine administration, only minimal daily ECG changes were recorded. A significant difference in the lipid peroxidation and antioxidant defense system activity in patients of groups I and II was determined. We noticed deepening of endothelial dysfunction on the background of cytostatic therapy with anthracycline antibiotics compared with baseline values in patients of group II. It was found that prophylactic L-arginine increases superoxide dismutase level and reduces the total NOS activity due to its inducible isoform. CONCLUSION: The leading factor of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity is the imbalance between free radical generation and their inactivation that leads to endothelial dysfunction development. L-arginine eliminates the prooxidant-antioxidant imbalance and improves the endothelial function.","['Skrypnyk, I', 'Maslova, G', 'Lymanets, T', 'Gusachenko, I']","['Skrypnyk I', 'Maslova G', 'Lymanets T', 'Gusachenko I']","['Chair of Internal Medicine numero sign 1, Ukrainian Medical Stomatological Academy, Poltava 36011, Ukraine.', 'Chair of Internal Medicine numero sign 1, Ukrainian Medical Stomatological Academy, Poltava 36011, Ukraine.', 'Chair of Internal Medicine numero sign 1, Ukrainian Medical Stomatological Academy, Poltava 36011, Ukraine.', 'Hematology Department, M.V.

The major drawbacks regarding TKIs are their low efficacy in eradicating the leukemic stem cells responsible for disease maintenance and relapse upon drug cessation. Herein, we performed ribonucleic acid sequencing of flow-sorted primitive (CD34(+)CD38(low)) and progenitor (CD34(+) CD38(+)) chronic phase CML cells, and identified transcriptional upregulation of 32 cell surface molecules relative to corresponding normal bone marrow cells. Focusing on novel markers with increased expression on primitive CML cells, we confirmed upregulation of the scavenger receptor CD36 and the leptin receptor by flow cytometry. We also delineate a subpopulation of primitive CML cells expressing CD36 that is less sensitive to imatinib treatment. Using CD36 targeting antibodies, we show that the CD36 positive cells can be targeted and killed by antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. In summary, CD36 defines a subpopulation of primitive CML cells with decreased imatinib sensitivity that can be effectively targeted and killed using an anti-CD36 antibody.","['Landberg, Niklas', 'von Palffy, Sofia', 'Askmyr, Maria', 'Lilljebjorn, Henrik', 'Sanden, Carl', 'Rissler, Marianne', 'Mustjoki, Satu', 'Hjorth-Hansen, Henrik', 'Richter, Johan', 'Agerstam, Helena', 'Jaras, Marcus', 'Fioretos, Thoas']","['Landberg N', 'von Palffy S', 'Askmyr M', 'Lilljebjorn H', 'Sanden C', 'Rissler M', 'Mustjoki S', 'Hjorth-Hansen H', 'Richter J', 'Agerstam H', 'Jaras M', 'Fioretos T']","['Division of Clinical Genetics, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Sweden niklas.landberg@med.lu.se thoas.fioretos@med.lu.se.', 'Division of Clinical Genetics, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Sweden.', 'Division of Clinical Genetics, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Sweden.', 'Division of Clinical Genetics, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Sweden.', 'Division of Clinical Genetics, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Sweden.', 'Division of Clinical Genetics, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Sweden.', 'Hematology Research Unit Helsinki, Department of Clinical Chemistry and Hematology, University of Helsinki, and Helsinki University Hospital Comprehensive Cancer Center, Finland.', 'Department of Hematology, St Olavs Hospital, Trondheim, Norway.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Radiation Physics, Skane University Hospital, Lund, Sweden.', 'Division of Clinical Genetics, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Sweden.', 'Division of Clinical Genetics, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Sweden.', 'Division of Clinical Genetics, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Sweden niklas.landberg@med.lu.se thoas.fioretos@med.lu.se.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20171228,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,PMC5830390,,,2017/12/30 06:00,2019/03/07 06:00,['2017/12/30 06:00'],"['2017/04/10 00:00 [received]', '2017/12/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/12/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/07 06:00 [medline]', '2017/12/30 06:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.2017.169946 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2017.169946 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2018 Mar;103(3):447-455. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2017.169946.

Here, we compare high-throughput sequencing (HTS) of IGH and TRG genes vs flow cytometry (FC) for measurable residual disease (MRD) detection at the end of induction chemotherapy in pediatric patients with newly diagnosed B-ALL. Six hundred nineteen paired pretreatment and end-of-induction bone marrow samples from Children's Oncology Group studies AALL0331 (clinicaltrials.gov #NCT00103285) (standard risk [SR]; with MRD by FC at any level) and AALL0232 (clinicaltrials.gov #NCT00075725) (high risk; with day 29 MRD <0.1% by FC) were evaluated by HTS and FC for event-free (EFS) and overall survival (OS). HTS and FC showed similar 5-year EFS and OS for MRD-positive and -negative patients using an MRD threshold of 0.01%. However, there was a high discordant rate with HTS identifying 55 (38.7%) more patients MRD positive at this threshold. These discrepant patients have worse outcomes than FC MRD-negative patients. In addition, the increased analytic sensitivity of HTS permitted identification of 19.9% of SR patients without MRD at any detectable level who had excellent 5-year EFS (98.1%) and OS (100%). The higher analytic sensitivity and lower false-negative rate of HTS improves upon FC for MRD detection in pediatric B-ALL by identifying a novel subset of patients at end of induction who are essentially cured using current chemotherapy and identifying MRD at 0.01% in up to one-third of patients who are missed at the same threshold by FC.","['Wood, Brent', 'Wu, David', 'Crossley, Beryl', 'Dai, Yunfeng', 'Williamson, David', 'Gawad, Charles', 'Borowitz, Michael J', 'Devidas, Meenakshi', 'Maloney, Kelly W', 'Larsen, Eric', 'Winick, Naomi', 'Raetz, Elizabeth', 'Carroll, William L', 'Hunger, Stephen P', 'Loh, Mignon L', 'Robins, Harlan', 'Kirsch, Ilan']","['Wood B', 'Wu D', 'Crossley B', 'Dai Y', 'Williamson D', 'Gawad C', 'Borowitz MJ', 'Devidas M', 'Maloney KW', 'Larsen E', 'Winick N', 'Raetz E', 'Carroll WL', 'Hunger SP', 'Loh ML', 'Robins H', 'Kirsch I']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA.', 'Adaptive Biotechnologies, Seattle, WA.', 'Department of Biostatistics, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL.', 'Adaptive Biotechnologies, Seattle, WA.', ""Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", ""Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", 'Department of Biostatistics, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL.', ""University Physicians, Children's Hospital of Colorado, Aurora, CO."", ""Maine Children's Cancer Center, Scarborough, ME."", 'Pediatric Oncology, UT Southwestern, Dallas, TX.', 'Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT.', 'Pediatric Oncology, New York University, New York, NY.', ""Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA."", 'Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA; and.', 'Adaptive Biotechnologies, Seattle, WA.', 'Computational Biology, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA.', 'Adaptive Biotechnologies, Seattle, WA.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA175353/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180886/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180899/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20171228,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,PMC5865233,,,2017/12/30 06:00,2019/03/20 06:00,['2017/12/30 06:00'],"['2017/09/13 00:00 [received]', '2017/12/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/12/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/20 06:00 [medline]', '2017/12/30 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)32383-1 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2017-09-806521 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2018 Mar 22;131(12):1350-1359. doi: 10.1182/blood-2017-09-806521.

Secondary objectives included evaluation of transplant-related disease states and medications in the post-transplant setting that may lead to an increased risk of falls, post-fall variables, and number of tests ordered after a fall. Methods This retrospective, case-control study matched patients in a 2:1 ratio of nonfallers to fallers. Data from The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center (OSUWMC) reported fall events and patient electronic medical records were utilized. A total of 168 adult Blood and Marrow Transplant inpatients with a hematological malignancy diagnosis were evaluated from 1 January 2010 to 30 September 2012. Results Univariable and multivariable conditional logistic regression models were used to assess the relationship between potential predictor variables of interest and falls. Variables that were found to be significant predictors of falls from the univariable models include age group, incontinence, benzodiazepines, corticosteroids, anticonvulsants and antidepressants, and number of days status-post transplant. When considered for a multivariable model age group, corticosteroids, and a cancer diagnosis of leukemia were significant in the final model. Conclusion Recent medication utilization such as benzodiazepines, anticonvulsants, corticosteroids, and antidepressants placed patients at a higher risk of experiencing a fall. Other significant factors identified from a multivariable analysis found were patients older than age 65, patients with recent corticosteroid administration and a cancer diagnosis of leukemia.","['Vela, Cory M', 'Grate, Lisa M', 'McBride, Ali', 'Devine, Steven', 'Andritsos, Leslie A']","['Vela CM', 'Grate LM', 'McBride A', 'Devine S', 'Andritsos LA']","['1 H.

Current recommendations by several groups suggest cardiac monitoring prior to and during anthracycline therapy. We aim to review the usefulness of baseline cardiac screening for left ventricular ejection fraction to assess if it had any impact on chemotherapy decisions in patients to be treated with anthracycline-based regimens or any beneficial effect upon outcomes. Methods We conducted a retrospective three-year audit of cancer patients who underwent GBPS prior to anthracycline (doxorubicin) chemotherapy. Subjects were identified via records from the Department of Nuclear Medicine. Pharmacy dispensing records identified those who received doxorubicin. Patient demographics, cancer type, cardiac risk factors, GBPS ejection fraction (EF), and cumulative anthracycline dose were collected. Results From 1 August 2009 to 31 July 2012, 179 patients underwent GBPS pre-doxorubicin chemotherapy. The mean age was 59 years (range 21-89 years), with 51% being males. Only two patients (1.1%) had an abnormal EF < 50%, while 33 patients (18%) had an EF 51-59% and 144 patients (80%) had EF >/= 60%. The two patients with reduced baseline EF still received anthracycline-based chemotherapy. All 135 patients without any known cardiovascular risk factors had normal EFs. The total number of patients who received anthracycline chemotherapy during the same period was 207. Thus 28 patients (13%) commenced anthracycline without a prior GBPS. Conclusion Only 1.1% of the screened patients had EF < 50%.

In May 2014, the US Food and Drug Administration approved revisions to the packaging information that included directions for home administration of reconstituted omacetaxine by patients or caregivers using syringes filled at a healthcare facility. We developed recommendations for the transport, storage, and spill-clean procedure of reconstituted omacetaxine for home and clinic administration. Methods We conducted chemical stability and microbial growth studies of reconstituted omacetaxine solution stored in vials and syringes at room temperature or refrigerated for various durations. Several shipping configurations were tested in simulated transport conditions to evaluate their ability to contain solution leakage and maintain product quality during distribution. In addition, we evaluated cleaning products and procedures for their effectiveness in removing residual omacetaxine from household surfaces after mock spills. Results Reconstituted omacetaxine showed limited degradation when refrigerated for 14 days in vials and syringes, and no microbial growth was observed for 12 days after intentional inoculation. In shipping studies, the configurations maintained prepared syringes within the recommended storage temperature range throughout transport and could contain leaks if spills occurred. In the event of an accidental spill in a home environment, effective cleaning can be achieved using household cleaning products and defined procedures. Conclusion These data provide important information regarding the safe transportation and administration of reconstituted omacetaxine in the home and clinic.","['Parikh, Alpa', 'van de Rijn, Jennifer', 'Melville, Chris', 'Sarkari, Marazban', 'Peltier, Sylvie', 'McKean, Robert']","['Parikh A', 'van de Rijn J', 'Melville C', 'Sarkari M', 'Peltier S', 'McKean R']","['Teva Branded Pharmaceutical Products R&D, Inc., USA.', 'Teva Branded Pharmaceutical Products R&D, Inc., USA.', 'Teva Branded Pharmaceutical Products R&D, Inc., USA.', 'Teva Branded Pharmaceutical Products R&D, Inc., USA.', 'Teva Branded Pharmaceutical Products R&D, Inc., USA.', 'Teva Branded Pharmaceutical Products R&D, Inc., USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20170220,England,J Oncol Pharm Pract,Journal of oncology pharmacy practice : official publication of the International Society of Oncology Pharmacy Practitioners,9511372,,['NOTNLM'],"['Omacetaxine mepesuccinate', 'home administration', 'stability']",2017/12/30 06:00,2018/07/25 06:00,['2017/12/30 06:00'],"['2017/12/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/07/25 06:00 [medline]', '2017/12/30 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/1078155217692151 [doi]'],ppublish,J Oncol Pharm Pract. 2018 Apr;24(3):201-208. doi: 10.1177/1078155217692151.

Both dasatinib and nilotinib are indicated for first-line treatment as well as for treatment-resistant chronic myeloid leukemia. Animal studies with dasatinib or nilotinib demonstrate fetal skeletal malformations as well as significant mortality during organogenesis. The goal of this article is to review the experience to date of dasatinib and nilotinib in human pregnancy, specifically dasatinib and nilotinib dose, length of exposure, trimester of use, as well as patient and fetal outcomes. Based on the limited data, both dasatinib and nilotinib may cause fetal harm. Additionally, thorough analysis of the available literature indicates no correlation between dasatinib nor nilotinib dose, length of exposure, trimester of use, and deleterious patient or fetal outcomes can be concluded. Therefore, health care professionals need to regularly counsel women of child bearing potential with chronic myeloid leukemia regarding the risks of taking dasatinib or nilotinib during pregnancy. The safest potential therapeutic options for the management of chronic myeloid leukemia in pregnancy include temporary discontinuation of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor followed by observation or intervention with interferon alfa and/or leukapheresis.","['Barkoulas, Theodora', 'Hall, Philip D']","['Barkoulas T', 'Hall PD']","['South Carolina College of Pharmacy, Medical University of South Carolina, USA.', 'South Carolina College of Pharmacy, Medical University of South Carolina, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20170217,England,J Oncol Pharm Pract,Journal of oncology pharmacy practice : official publication of the International Society of Oncology Pharmacy Practitioners,9511372,,['NOTNLM'],"['Dasatinib', 'chronic myeloid leukemia', 'nilotinib', 'pregnancy']",2017/12/30 06:00,2018/07/22 06:00,['2017/12/30 06:00'],"['2017/12/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/07/22 06:00 [medline]', '2017/12/30 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/1078155217692399 [doi]'],ppublish,J Oncol Pharm Pract. 2018 Mar;24(2):121-128. doi: 10.1177/1078155217692399.

Patients were followed to determine switching and discontinuation rates. Factors associated with switching or discontinuation from index TKI therapy, reasons for discontinuation based on electronic chart notes, and frequency of laboratory monitoring were assessed during the follow-up period. Methods A retrospective cohort study was conducted in chronic myelogenous leukemia patients aged >/= 18 years who were identified from the Kaiser Permanente Southern California (KPSC) Cancer Registry database during the study time period of 1 January 2007 to 12 December 2013. The index date was defined as the date of the first TKI prescription (imatinib, dasatinib, or nilotinib) identified during the study time period with no prior history of TKI use within 12 months. Patients had to have continuous membership with drug benefit eligibility and no prior history of stem cell transplant (SCT) or other cancers during the 12 months prior to the index date. Baseline characteristics were identified during 12 months prior to the index date and outcomes were identified during the follow-up period after the index date. All patients were followed from index TKI therapy until end of study time period (12 December 2014), death, stem cell transplant, or disenrollment from the health plan unless one of the following occurred first: a patient switched their index therapy, or a patient discontinued their index therapy. Forward stepwise selection multivariable logistic regression models were used to evaluate factors associated with patients who continued therapy compared to those who switched or discontinued therapy with the index TKI. Chart notes were reviewed 30 days prior and 30 days post index TKI discontinuation to evaluate reasons for discontinuation. Molecular and cytogenetic testing frequency was also assessed during the follow-up period among the different patient groups. Results Two hundred sixteen patients were identified with incident chronic myelogenous leukemia and use of TKI therapy: 189 (87.5%) received imatinib, 19 (8.8%) received dasatinib, and 8 (3.7%) received nilotinib. The mean age on index date was 53 years and 63% were male; 103 patients (48%) continued on their index therapy, while 62 patients (28%) switched, and 51 patients (24%) discontinued.","['Rashid, Nazia', 'Koh, Han A', 'Lin, Kathy J', 'Stwalley, Brian', 'Felber, Eugene']","['Rashid N', 'Koh HA', 'Lin KJ', 'Stwalley B', 'Felber E']","['1 Kaiser Permanente, Southern California Region, Drug Information Services, Downey, CA, USA.', '2 Southern California Permanente Medical Group, Kaiser Permanente Southern California, Bellflower, CA, USA.', '1 Kaiser Permanente, Southern California Region, Drug Information Services, Downey, CA, USA.', '3 Bristol-Myers Squibb, US Medical Health Services (Field), CA, USA.', '3 Bristol-Myers Squibb, US Medical Health Services (Field), CA, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Pragmatic Clinical Trial']",20170310,England,J Oncol Pharm Pract,Journal of oncology pharmacy practice : official publication of the International Society of Oncology Pharmacy Practitioners,9511372,,['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic myeloid leukemia', 'molecular monitoring', 'switching', 'treatment patterns', 'tyrosine kinase inhibitor']",2017/12/30 06:00,2018/08/22 06:00,['2017/12/30 06:00'],"['2017/12/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/08/22 06:00 [medline]', '2017/12/30 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/1078155217697484 [doi]'],ppublish,J Oncol Pharm Pract. 2018 Jun;24(4):253-263. doi: 10.1177/1078155217697484.

29284153,NLM,MEDLINE,20181214,1096-1186 (Electronic) 1043-6618 (Linking),128,2018 Feb,Role of RET protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitors in the treatment RET-driven thyroid and lung cancers.,1-17,S1043-6618(17)31665-1 [pii] 10.1016/j.phrs.2017.12.021 [doi],"RET is a transmembrane receptor protein-tyrosine kinase that is required for the development of the nervous system and several other tissues. The mechanism of activation of RET by its glial-cell derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) ligands differs from that of all other receptor protein-tyrosine kinases owing to the requirement for additional GDNF family receptor-alpha (GFRalpha) co-receptors (GFRalpha1/2/3/4). RET point mutations have been reported in multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN2A, MEN2B) and medullary thyroid carcinoma. In contrast, RET fusion proteins have been reported in papillary thyroid and non-small cell lung adenocarcinomas. More than a dozen fusion partners of RET have been described in papillary thyroid carcinomas, most frequently CCDC6-RET and NCOA4-RET. RET-fusion proteins, commonly KIF5B-RET, have also been found in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Several drugs targeting RET have been approved by the FDA for the treatment of cancer: (i) cabozantinib and vandetanib for medullary thyroid carcinomas and (ii) lenvatinib and sorafenib for differentiated thyroid cancers. In addition, alectinib and sunitinib are approved for the treatment of other neoplasms. Each of these drugs is a multikinase inhibitor that has activity against RET. Previous X-ray studies indicated that vandetanib binds within the ATP-binding pocket and forms a hydrogen bond with A807 within the RET hinge and it makes hydrophobic contact with L881 of the catalytic spine which occurs in the floor of the adenine-binding pocket. Our molecular modeling studies indicate that the other antagonists bind in a similar fashion. All of these antagonists bind to the active conformation of RET and are therefore classified as type I inhibitors. The drugs also make variable contacts with other residues of the regulatory and catalytic spines. None of these drugs was designed to bind preferentially to RET and it is hypothesized that RET-specific antagonists might produce even better clinical outcomes. Currently the number of new cases of neoplasms bearing RET mutations or RET-fusion proteins is estimated to be about 10,000 per year in the United States. This is about the same as the incidence of chronic myelogenous leukemia for which imatinib and second and third generation BCR-Abl non-receptor protein-tyrosine kinase antagonists have proven clinically efficacious and which are commercially successful. These findings warrant the continued development of specific antagonists targeting RET-driven neoplasms.","['Roskoski, Robert Jr', 'Sadeghi-Nejad, Abdollah']","['Roskoski R Jr', 'Sadeghi-Nejad A']","['Blue Ridge Institute for Medical Research, 3754 Brevard Road, Suite 116, Box 19, Horse Shoe, NC 28742-8814, United States.

However, which of these two donor types is optimal for patients with leukemia in need of allografting is unknown. RECENT FINDINGS: For patients with acute leukemia, results of UCB SCT have been improved by the use of double umbilical cord units and emerging ex-vivo expansion technologies. However, the costs associated with procuring double cord units and high transplant-related mortality due to delayed immunological reconstitution and infections, particularly in adult patients, remain a problem. Recently, Haplo SCT has become an increasingly utilized alternative donor source. While improvements of ex-vivo T-cell depletion platforms continue, emergence of T-cell-replete platforms, such as the use of post-transplantation cyclophosphamide (PTCy), is increasingly being utilized in treating acute leukemia patients. PTCy-based Haplo SCT is gaining popularity among transplant clinicians due to its relatively easy learning curve, low cost, low incidence of graft-versus-host disease, and favorable survival in acute leukemia patients. SUMMARY: The clinical question of whether Haplo SCT should replace UCB SCT needs to be answered by ongoing randomized trials. However, the rapidly increasing adoption of Haplo SCT worldwide as the viable alternative for patients without a human leukocyte antigen-matched donor has seemingly addressed the question ahead of scientific judgment.","['Liu, Jia Hau', 'Kanakry, Christopher G', 'Luznik, Leo']","['Liu JH', 'Kanakry CG', 'Luznik L']","['Division of Hematologic Malignancies, Department of Oncology, The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.', 'Tai-Cheng Stem Cell Therapy Center, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Experimental Transplantation and Immunology Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'Division of Hematologic Malignancies, Department of Oncology, The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,,,,2017/12/29 06:00,2019/01/12 06:00,['2017/12/29 06:00'],"['2017/12/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/12 06:00 [medline]', '2017/12/29 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/MOH.0000000000000412 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2018 Mar;25(2):103-111. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0000000000000412.,20190111,2,,IM,"['Acute Disease', '*Cord Blood Stem Cell Transplantation', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*therapy', '*Transplantation, Haploidentical']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite the associated graft-versus-leukemia effect, leukemia relapse remains the most common cause of treatment failure after alloHCT. Here, we review the available data on whether there is an advantage in providing pretransplant consolidation chemotherapy prior to alloHCT. RECENT FINDINGS: Randomized controlled studies are lacking. Data derive largely from four large retrospective registry studies. These analyses are consistent in demonstrating the lack of any survival benefit for pretransplant consolidation chemotherapy once a patient achieves a complete remission and a donor is readily available. These results are valid across conditioning regimen intensities, donor sources, and doses of cytarabine administered during consolidation. SUMMARY: Available evidence suggests that patients with acute myeloid leukemia in first complete remission for whom a suitable donor is readily available should not be given pretransplant consolidation before proceeding to alloHCT, regardless of conditioning regimen intensity and that transplantation should be offered promptly at the time remission is achieved without undue delay. Nevertheless, patients for whom a suitable donor is not readily available after achieving first remission, should probably receive 'bridging' consolidation chemotherapy while waiting for a donor to be identified in an attempt to decrease the risk of early disease recurrence before transplantation. The role of minimal residual disease and genetic markers in directing consolidation choices are unclear to date.","['Yeshurun, Moshe', 'Wolach, Ofir']","['Yeshurun M', 'Wolach O']","['Institute of Hematology, Davidoff Cancer Center, Beilinson Hospital, Petah Tikva and Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,,,,2017/12/29 06:00,2019/01/12 06:00,['2017/12/29 06:00'],"['2017/12/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/12 06:00 [medline]', '2017/12/29 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/MOH.0000000000000410 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2018 Mar;25(2):75-80. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0000000000000410.,20190111,2,,IM,"['Allografts', 'Consolidation Chemotherapy/*methods', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/pathology/*therapy', 'Remission Induction']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

New treatment strategies which improve drug delivery and exploit cellular targets are changing the landscape of how we treat this disease. RECENT FINDINGS: Induction therapy is in the process of changing for several patient populations. The introduction of CPX-351 offers a novel strategy for treating patients with therapy-related AML or AML with myelodysplasia-related changes; gemtuzumab ozogamicin may become incorporated into standard induction therapy, especially for patients with core-binding factor leukemias; and for older adults, combination therapy with venetoclax may offer a more efficacious strategy than the single-agent regimens previously used. Additionally, targeted therapies are now becoming available for patients with mutations in FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) or isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (IDH2), ushering in an era of personalized medicine in the treatment of AML. SUMMARY: The US Food and Drug Administration approval of several agents in 2017 will change the way AML treatment is approached and will offer both clinicians and patients a new armamentarium with which to treat this disease.","['Menghrajani, Kamal', 'Tallman, Martin S']","['Menghrajani K', 'Tallman MS']","['Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.', 'Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.', 'Weill-Cornell Medical College, New York, New York, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,,,,2017/12/29 06:00,2019/01/12 06:00,['2017/12/29 06:00'],"['2017/12/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/12 06:00 [medline]', '2017/12/29 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/MOH.0000000000000409 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2018 Mar;25(2):90-94. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0000000000000409.,20190111,2,"['0 (Aminoglycosides)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '93NS566KF7 (Gemtuzumab)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aminoglycosides/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Gemtuzumab', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Risk Factors']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, it also exerts tumor-suppressive functions in p53-independent contexts. The activities of p14arf are regulated by the nucleolar chaperone nucleophosmin (NPM1), which controls its levels and cellular localization. In acute myeloid leukemia with mutations in the NPM1 gene, mutated NPM1 aberrantly translocates in the cytosol carrying with itself p14arf that is subsequently degraded, thus impairing the p14arf-HDM2-p53 axis. In this work we investigated the complex between these two proteins by means of NMR and other techniques. We identified a novel NPM1-interacting motif in the C-terminal region of p14arf, which corresponds to its predicted nucleolar localization signal. This motif recognizes a specific region of the NPM1 N-terminal domain and, upon binding, the two proteins form soluble high molecular weight complexes. By NMR, we identified critical residues on both proteins involved in the interaction. Collectively, our data provide a structural framework to rationalize the overall assembly of the p14arf-NPM1 supramolecular complexes. A number of p14arf cancer-associated mutations cluster in this motif and their effect on the interaction with NPM1 was also analyzed.","['Luchinat, Enrico', 'Chiarella, Sara', 'Franceschini, Mimma', 'Di Matteo, Adele', 'Brunori, Maurizio', 'Banci, Lucia', 'Federici, Luca']","['Luchinat E', 'Chiarella S', 'Franceschini M', 'Di Matteo A', 'Brunori M', 'Banci L', 'Federici L']","['CERM, Centro Risonanze Magnetiche, Universita di Firenze, Italy.', 'Dipartimento di Scienze Biomediche, Sperimentali e Cliniche - Universita di Firenze, Italy.', 'Ce.S.I.-MeT Centro di Scienze dell\'Invecchiamento e Medicina Traslazionale, Universita ""G. d\'Annunzio"" di Chieti, Italy.', 'Dipartimento di Scienze Mediche, Orali e Biotecnologiche - Universita ""G. d\'Annunzio"" di Chieti, Italy.', 'Ce.S.I.-MeT Centro di Scienze dell\'Invecchiamento e Medicina Traslazionale, Universita ""G. d\'Annunzio"" di Chieti, Italy.', 'Dipartimento di Scienze Mediche, Orali e Biotecnologiche - Universita ""G. d\'Annunzio"" di Chieti, Italy.', 'Istituto di Biologia e Patologia Molecolari, Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche, Roma, Italy.', 'Dipartimento di Scienze Biochimiche, ""A.

In this study, we repositioned thiopurine drugs used for the treatment of acute leukaemia as new tyrosinase inhibitors. Tyrosinase catalyses two successive oxidations in melanin biosynthesis: the conversions of tyrosine to dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) and DOPA to dopaquinone. Continuous efforts are underway to discover small molecule inhibitors of tyrosinase for therapeutic and cosmetic purposes. Structure-based virtual screening predicted inhibitor candidates from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs. Enzyme assays confirmed the thiopurine leukaemia drug, thioguanine, as a tyrosinase inhibitor with the inhibitory constant of 52 muM. Two other thiopurine drugs, mercaptopurine and azathioprine, were also evaluated for their tyrosinase inhibition; mercaptopurine caused stronger inhibition than thioguanine did, whereas azathioprine was a poor inhibitor. The inhibitory constant of mercaptopurine (16 muM) was comparable to that of the well-known inhibitor kojic acid (13 muM). The cell-based assay using B16F10 melanoma cells confirmed that the compounds inhibit mammalian tyrosinase. Particularly, 50 muM thioguanine reduced the melanin content by 57%, without apparent cytotoxicity. Cheminformatics showed that the thiopurine drugs shared little chemical similarity with the known tyrosinase inhibitors.","['Choi, Joonhyeok', 'Lee, You-Mie', 'Jee, Jun-Goo']","['Choi J', 'Lee YM', 'Jee JG']","['Research Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, Kyungpook National University, 80 Daehak-ro, Buk-gu, Daegu 41566, Korea. crowz124@naver.com.', 'Research Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, Kyungpook National University, 80 Daehak-ro, Buk-gu, Daegu 41566, Korea. lym@knu.ac.kr.', 'Research Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, Kyungpook National University, 80 Daehak-ro, Buk-gu, Daegu 41566, Korea. jjee@knu.ac.kr.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20171228,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,PMC5796027,['NOTNLM'],"['cheminformatics', 'docking simulation', 'drug repositioning', 'thiopurine', 'tyrosinase']",2017/12/29 06:00,2018/07/25 06:00,['2017/12/29 06:00'],"['2017/10/21 00:00 [received]', '2017/12/14 00:00 [revised]', '2017/12/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/12/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/12/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/07/25 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms19010077 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms19010077 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2017 Dec 28;19(1). pii: ijms19010077. doi: 10.3390/ijms19010077.,20180724,1,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Melanins)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'EC 1.14.18.1 (Monophenol Monooxygenase)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)', 'MRK240IY2L (Azathioprine)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/chemistry/therapeutic use', 'Azathioprine/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Catalytic Domain', '*Drug Repositioning', 'Enzyme Assays', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Melanins/*antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Melanoma, Experimental/drug therapy/enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Mercaptopurine/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Molecular Docking Simulation', 'Monophenol Monooxygenase/*antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Conformation, alpha-Helical', 'Protein Conformation, beta-Strand', 'Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Thioguanine/chemistry/therapeutic use', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,,['The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Thirty 8-week-old male SD rats were randomly divided into five groups of equal number: blank control, model control, high-dose CS, medium-dose CS, and low-dose CS. OAS models were established by intraperitoneal injection of cyclophosphamide and, a month later, treated intragastrically with normal saline or CS at 2, 1, and 0.5 g per kg of the body weight per day, all for 4 weeks. Then, the testes of the animals were harvested to obtain the testicular weight, sperm concentration and motility, and the level of serum testosterone (T), detect the expressions of the transcription factor 1 (Oct4), Thy-1 cell surface antigen (Thy1), promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF), KIT proto-oncogene receptor tyrosine kinase (C-kit) and glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) in the testis tissue of the rats in the low-dose CS group by real-time PCR. RESULTS: The testis weights in the blank control, model control, high-dose CS, medium-dose CS, and low-dose CS groups were (1.52+/-0.06), (1.55+/-0.06), (1.43+/-0.30), (1.35+/-0.40) and (1.34+/-0.04) g, respectively, not significantly different in the blank and model controls from those in the CS groups (P>0.05). The visual field sperm count per 10 HP was significantly increased in the high-, medium-, and low-dose CS groups (202+/-20, 196+/-5 and 216+/-25) as compared with the blank and model controls (200+/-15 and 134+/-30) (P<0.05). The mRNA expressions of the Oct4, Thy1, PLZF and GDNF genes were remarkably higher in the low-dose CS group than in the controls (P<0.05), but that of the C-kit gene showed no significant difference from the latter (P>0.05). The visual field sperm motility per 10 HP was markedly increased in the blank control (52.1+/-5.5%), model control (38.1+/-2.5%), high-dose CS (59.1+/-9.5%), medium-dose CS (58.7+/-9.5%), and low-dose CS (49.6+/-1.0%) groups, and so was the level of serum testosterone (190+/-87.5, 82.5+/-25.8, 229+/-75.6, 331+/-86.7 and 185+/-82.4 mmol/L), both remarkably higher in the CS groups than in the model controls (P<0.05) but with no statistically significant difference between the CS groups and the blank controls (P>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: CS can significantly improve sperm concentration, sperm motility and serum T level in OAS rats, probably by inducing the expression of GDNF in the rat Sertoli cells, promoting the proliferation of undifferentiated spermatogonial cells, and enhancing spermatogenesis.","['Cao, Yi-Juan', 'Li, Zhen-Bei', 'Qi, Yu-Juan', 'Liu, Ying', 'Gu, Juan', 'Hu, Fang-Fang', 'Zhang, Wen-da', 'Hao, Lin', 'Hou, Jian-Quan', 'Han, Cong-Hui']","['Cao YJ', 'Li ZB', 'Qi YJ', 'Liu Y', 'Gu J', 'Hu FF', 'Zhang WD', 'Hao L', 'Hou JQ', 'Han CH']","['Department of Urology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu 215006, China.', 'Center of Reproductive Medicine, Xuzhou Central Hospital, Xuzhou, Jiangsu 221009, China.', 'Center of Reproductive Medicine, Xuzhou Central Hospital, Xuzhou, Jiangsu 221009, China.', 'Center of Reproductive Medicine, Xuzhou Central Hospital, Xuzhou, Jiangsu 221009, China.', 'Center of Reproductive Medicine, Xuzhou Central Hospital, Xuzhou, Jiangsu 221009, China.', 'Center of Reproductive Medicine, Xuzhou Central Hospital, Xuzhou, Jiangsu 221009, China.', 'Department of Urology, Xuzhou Central Hospital, Xuzhou, Jiangsu 221009, China.', 'Department of Urology, Xuzhou Central Hospital, Xuzhou, Jiangsu 221009, China.', 'Department of Urology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu 215006, China.', 'Department of Urology, Xuzhou Central Hospital, Xuzhou, Jiangsu 221009, China.', 'Xuzhou Center of Reproductive Medicine, Southeast University, Xuzhou, Jiangsu 221009, China.']",['chi'],,['Journal Article'],,China,Zhonghua Nan Ke Xue,Zhonghua nan ke xue = National journal of andrology,101093592,,['NOTNLM'],"['cynomorium songaricum', 'glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor', 'oligoasthenospermia', 'serum testosterone', 'sperm count', 'sperm motility', 'undifferentiated spermatogonial cell']",2017/12/29 06:00,2018/04/17 06:00,['2017/12/29 06:00'],"['2017/12/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/12/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/04/17 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Nan Ke Xue. 2016 Dec;22(12):1116-1121.,20180416,12,"['0 (Drugs, Chinese Herbal)', '3XMK78S47O (Testosterone)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cynomorium/*chemistry', 'Drugs, Chinese Herbal/*pharmacology', 'Male', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sertoli Cells', 'Sperm Count', 'Sperm Motility', 'Spermatogenesis', 'Spermatogonia/*drug effects', 'Spermatozoa/drug effects', 'Testis/*drug effects', 'Testosterone/blood']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) of sALL cases were calculated by site and 1M stage. We also evaluated the differences in 5-year sALL survival by age, site, and extent of 1M, latency of sALL after 1M, and evidence of underlying racial/ethnic disparity. We identified 10,956 patients with de-novo/primary acute lymphoblastic leukemia (1ALL) and 772 with sALL. Women (49.1% vs. 42.9%), white patients (72.0% vs. 59.5%), older patients (58.8% vs. 25.2%; age >/=65 years), and patients diagnosed between 2003 and 2012 (66.8% vs. 53.9%) had a higher proportion of sALL compared with 1ALL. There was a significantly inferior median 5-year survival for sALL patients compared to 1ALL (6 vs. 15 months; HR 1.20, 95% CI 1.10-1.31, P < 0.001). The median latency period was 60.0 months; the most common 1M among sALL patients were breast (17.9%) and prostate (17.4%). Patients with any 1M were at increased risk of developing sALL (SIR 1.76, 95% CI 1.58-1.95, P < 0.001).

METHODS: We assessed the consistency of the Moreau score in a series of 138 patients with at least two samples involved by a B-LPD (316 samples) other than germinal center-derived malignancies, hairy cell leukemia, and mantle cell lymphomas. Patients with evidence of two distinct B-LPDs were also excluded. RESULTS: We found 53 inconsistencies in 44 of 138 (32%) patients. FMC7 was the most inconsistent (18 cases) and CD5 the least (5 cases). CD200 was inconsistent in 6 of 67 (9%) cases. The most important predictive factor for the finding of antigenic inconsistencies was sampling of a different anatomic site. Other factors, including number of samples, time between samples, or cytogenetic group, were not predictive. For the most part, these inconsistencies did not appear to be clinically relevant. CONCLUSION: Inconsistencies in the Moreau score are common, supporting the importance of integrated laboratory diagnosis. However, the practical implications of these antigenic inconsistencies are probably limited.","['Sorigue, Marc', 'Sarrate, Edurne', 'Franch-Sarto, Mireia', 'Feliu, Evarist', 'Junca, Jordi']","['Sorigue M', 'Sarrate E', 'Franch-Sarto M', 'Feliu E', 'Junca J']","['Hematology Laboratory, ICO-Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol, Josep Carreras Leukemia Research Institute, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Badalona, Spain.', 'Hematology Laboratory, ICO-Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol, Josep Carreras Leukemia Research Institute, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Badalona, Spain.', 'Hematology Laboratory, ICO-Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol, Josep Carreras Leukemia Research Institute, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Badalona, Spain.', 'Hematology Laboratory, ICO-Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol, Josep Carreras Leukemia Research Institute, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Badalona, Spain.', 'Hematology Laboratory, ICO-Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol, Josep Carreras Leukemia Research Institute, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Badalona, Spain.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20171228,United States,J Clin Lab Anal,Journal of clinical laboratory analysis,8801384,PMC6817032,['NOTNLM'],"['B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder', 'CD200', 'CD5', 'Moreau chronic lymphocytic leukemia score', 'consistency']",2017/12/29 06:00,2018/10/10 06:00,['2017/12/29 06:00'],"['2017/11/02 00:00 [received]', '2017/12/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/12/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/10 06:00 [medline]', '2017/12/29 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcla.22376 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Lab Anal. 2018 Jun;32(5):e22376. doi: 10.1002/jcla.22376.

However, these beneficial effects are limited by the transient function of adoptively transferred NK cells. Previous studies demonstrate that cytokine-induced memory-like NK cells that are preactivated by IL-12, IL-15, and IL-18 have enhanced effector functions and long life span in vivo. Here, we investigated the effects of IL-12/18-preactivated and IL-12/15/18-preactivated donor NK cells on GVL and aGVHD in a murine model of allo-HSCT. We found that both IL-12/18- and IL-12/15/18-preactivated NK cells mediated stronger GVL effect than control NK cells mainly due to their elevated activation/cytotoxicity and sustained proliferative potential. Interestingly, we observed that although both IL-12/18- and IL-12/15/18-preactivated NK cells significantly inhibited severe aGVHD, only the IL-12/18-preactivated NK cells maintained the beneficial effect of donor NK cells on mild aGVHD. The IL-12/15/18-preactivated NK cell infusion accelerated aGVHD in the fully-mismatched mild aGVHD model. Our results demonstrated that IL-12/18-preactivated NK cells displayed sustained and enhanced GVL functions, and could mitigate aGVHD despite the severity of the disease. IL-12/18-preactivated donor NK cell infusion may be an effective and safe adoptive therapy after allo-HSCT.","['Song, Yuan', 'Hu, Bo', 'Liu, Yonghao', 'Jin, Ziqi', 'Zhang, Yinsheng', 'Lin, Dandan', 'Zhu, Ying', 'Lei, Lei', 'Gong, Huanle', 'Mei, Yu', 'Teo, Huey Yee', 'Wu, Depei', 'Liu, Haiyan']","['Song Y', 'Hu B', 'Liu Y', 'Jin Z', 'Zhang Y', 'Lin D', 'Zhu Y', 'Lei L', 'Gong H', 'Mei Y', 'Teo HY', 'Wu D', 'Liu H']","['Institute of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, China.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Institute of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, China.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Institute of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, China.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Institute of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, China.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Institute of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, China.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Institute of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, China.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Institute of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, China.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Institute of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, China.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Institute of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, China.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Immunology Programme, Life Sciences Institute and Department of Microbiology and Immunology, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Immunology Programme, Life Sciences Institute and Department of Microbiology and Immunology, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Institute of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, China.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Immunology Programme, Life Sciences Institute and Department of Microbiology and Immunology, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180129,Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,,['NOTNLM'],"['*GVHD', '*GVL', '*IL-15', '*Memory-like', '*NK cells']",2017/12/29 06:00,2019/01/23 06:00,['2017/12/29 06:00'],"['2017/06/11 00:00 [received]', '2017/11/25 00:00 [revised]', '2017/12/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/12/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/23 06:00 [medline]', '2017/12/29 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/eji.201747177 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 2018 Apr;48(4):670-682. doi: 10.1002/eji.201747177.

This neurotoxicity could lead to dose reduction or treatment discontinuation, which could in turn reduce survival. In this line, several studies associated peripheral neurotoxicity and polymorphisms in genes involved in pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of VCR. Nowadays, it is well known that these genes are regulated by microRNAs (miRNAs) and SNPs in miRNAs could modify their levels or function. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine whether SNPs in miRNAs could be associated with VCR-induced neurotoxicity. To achieve this aim, we analyzed all the SNPs in miRNAs (minor allele frequency (MAF) >/= 0.01) which could regulate VCR-related genes in a large cohort of Spanish children with B-cell precursor ALL (B-ALL) homogeneously treated with LAL/SHOP protocols. We identified the A allele of rs12402181 in the seed region of miR-3117-3p, that could affect the binding with ABCC1 and RALBP1 gene, and C allele of rs7896283 in pre-mature sequence of miR-4481, which could be involved in peripheral nerve regeneration, significantly associated with VCR-induced neurotoxicity.

We have previously found that polymorphisms in BCL2L11 gene coding for pro-apoptotic Bim protein influence reduction of overall survival (OS) in a corticosteroid (CS) dose-dependent manner in childhood ALL patients. The same set of SNPs was here investigated for an association with CS-related ON assessed retrospectively in 304 children with ALL from Quebec (QcALL cohort) who received Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI) ALL treatment protocols. Two-year cumulative incidence of symptomatic ON was 10.6%. Two BCL2L11 polymorphisms, the 891T>G (rs2241843) in all QcALL patients and 29201C>T (rs724710) in high-risk group were significantly associated with ON, P = 0.009 and P = 0.003, respectively. The association remained significant in multivariate model (HR891TT = 2.4, 95% CI 1.2-4.8, P = 0.01 and HR29201CC = 5.7, 95% CI 1.6-20.9, P = 0.008).

In the present study, we evaluated the cancer-inhibiting mechanism of AQ-101 and tested the therapeutic potential of this compound for treating cancer in mice. We found that AQ-101 was able to induce MDM2 protein degradation through a self-ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated mechanism. This AQ-101-induced MDM2 downregulation led to activation of p53, which contributed to apoptosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), especially those with a wild-type p53 phenotype and MDM2 expression in vitro and in vivo When given for a period of 2 weeks (20 mg/kg/day, 3x/week), AQ-101 inhibited development of ALL in nude or SCID mice with a human ALL xenograft and achieved cure by the end of the 5-month experiment. Importantly, AQ-101 showed minimal or no inhibitory effect on normal human hematopoiesis in vitro and was well tolerated in vivo in animal models. Given that MDM2-overexpressing cancers are commonly refractory to current treatment options, our study results suggest that further development of AQ-101 is warranted, as it represents a potentially new, safe anticancer drug with a novel strategy for targeting MDM2.

Patients with T-cell large granular lymphocytic leukemia (T-LGL) on the other hand are considered to be less vulnerable for severe opportunistic fungal infection as their course of disease is chronic and marked by less violent cytopenia then in e.g. Aplastic Anemia. Only neutropenia is regarded as independent risk factor for severe opportunistic infection in T-LGL patients. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of a 53 year old patient with T-LGL, Immune-Thrombocytopenia (ITP) and combined antibody deficiency, who presented with fever and reduced general condition. The patient revealed a complicated infection involving the lungs and later the brain, with the presentation of vomiting and seizures. Broad microbiological testing of blood-, lung- and cerebrospinal fluid samples was inconclusive. In the absence of mycological proof, Aspergillus infection was confirmed by pathological examination of a brain specimen and finally successfully treated with liposomal amphotericin B and voriconazole, adopting a long-term treatment scheme. CONCLUSIONS: Beyond typical problems in the clinical practice involving fungal infections and hematologic malignancies, this case of invasive aspergillosis in a patient with T-LGL illustrates caveats in diagnosis, therapy and follow-up. Our data support careful ambulatory monitoring for patients with T-LGL, even in the absence of neutropenia. Especially those patients with combined hematologic malignancies and immune defects are at risk. Long-term treatment adhesion for 12 months with sufficient drug levels was necessary for sustained clearance from infection.","['Turki, Amin T', 'Rashidi-Alavijeh, Jassin', 'Durig, Jan', 'Gerken, Guido', 'Rath, Peter-Michael', 'Witzke, Oliver']","['Turki AT', 'Rashidi-Alavijeh J', 'Durig J', 'Gerken G', 'Rath PM', 'Witzke O']","['Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation, West-German Cancer Center, University Hospital Essen, Essen, Germany. amin.turki@uk-essen.de.', 'Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, University Hospital Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, West-German Cancer Center, University Hospital Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, University Hospital Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Institute of Medical Microbiology, University Hospital Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Department of Infectious Diseases, University Hospital Essen, Essen, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20171228,England,BMC Infect Dis,BMC infectious diseases,100968551,PMC5745601,['NOTNLM'],"['*Amphotericin B', '*Aspergillus', '*Cerebral abscess', '*Invasive aspergillosis', '*T-LGL', '*Voriconazole']",2017/12/29 06:00,2018/03/31 06:00,['2017/12/29 06:00'],"['2017/10/12 00:00 [received]', '2017/12/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/12/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/12/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/31 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12879-017-2877-8 [doi]', '10.1186/s12879-017-2877-8 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Infect Dis. 2017 Dec 28;17(1):797. doi: 10.1186/s12879-017-2877-8.,20180330,1,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '7XU7A7DROE (Amphotericin B)', 'JFU09I87TR (Voriconazole)']",IM,"['Amphotericin B/therapeutic use', 'Antifungal Agents/therapeutic use', 'Aspergillosis/complications/*diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Aspergillus/isolation & purification', 'Brain/diagnostic imaging/microbiology/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Large Granular Lymphocytic/complications/*diagnosis', 'Lung/microbiology/pathology', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed', 'Voriconazole/therapeutic use']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is a common cause of ibrutinib discontinuation. Risk factors for atrial fibrillation include advanced age, hypertension (HTN), mitral valve disease (MVD), left atrial remodeling, coronary artery disease (CAD) and risk factors for cardiovascular dysfunction We conducted a retrospective case control study using the presence of left atrial abnormality identified on pre-ibrutinib EKGs, defined as either (1) Lead II-bifed p wave, with 40 mcsec between peaks for >/= 2.5 mm wide >/= 100 msec in duration, (2) Lead V1-biphasic P wave with terminal portion >/= 40 msec in duration or terminal portion >/= 1 mm deep or (3) PR interval >/= 200 msec (intra-atrial conduction delay) as a predictor for development of atrial fibrillation. 183 consecutively CLL patients treated with ibrutinib were identified. 44 patients met inclusion criteria (20 cases, 24 controls). 20 (11.3%) of patients developed atrial fibrillation. Left atrial enlargement was identified as a significant predictor of development of atrial fibrillation (OR 9.1, 95% CI 2.2-37.3, p=0.02). Age, baseline HTN, CAD, diabetes, age and sex were not significant predictors. Area under the ROC curve for the model was estimated to be 75%.

SUMMARY ANSWER: BOT cells were found in frozen-thawed and xenografted ovarian tissue in 1 of 11 BOT patients. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: The risk of reintroducing malignant cells upon ovarian tissue transplantation has been subject of debate for many years. Reimplantation of cryopreserved ovarian tissue from leukemia patients is unsafe, while results from studies of cryopreserved ovarian tissue from other forms of cancer, such as Hodgkin's lymphoma, are reassuring. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: Prospective experimental study conducted in an academic research unit using ovarian tissue from 11 patients undergoing cryopreservation for BOTs. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Histology, immunohistochemistry (IHC) for mucin 1 (MUC1) and cytokeratin 7 (CK7) and molecular analysis by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) for CK7 and MUC1 were performed on frozen-thawed ovarian tissue from 11 patients. Long-term (5 months) xenografting of ovarian tissue in immunodeficient mice was performed. The xenografts were analyzed by histology, IHC and RT-qPCR, furthermore IHC for CD10, a marker of endometriosis, was performed on a selected sample. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Analysis by histology, IHC and RT-qPCR indicated 10 of the ovarian tissue samples were negative. Analysis of the xenograft samples indicated nine were negative for malignant cells but in two xenografts glandular lesions were detected by histology. In these two xenografts, CK7 and MUC1 markers were demonstrated by IHC and CK7 expression also by RT-qPCR. A BOT was confirmed in the xenograft in which the original ovarian tissue was positive, while in the other case IHC demonstrated expression of endometriosis marker CD10. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Cryopreserved ovarian fragments cannot be tested before transplantation, therefore the preimplantation analysis cannot guarantee that all cryopreserved fragments will be free of BOT cells. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: BOT cells can be found in cryopreserved ovarian tissue from BOT patients, therefore preimplantation analysis is an absolute prerequisite. Endometriosis can also be detected in cryopreserved ovarian tissue and caution should also be exercised in this scenario.

The recent digital pathology equipments investigate and analyze the blood smear images automatically. The previous automated segmentation algorithms worked on healthy and non-healthy WBCs separately. Also, such algorithms had employed certain color components which leak adaptively with different datasets. Methods: In this paper, a novel segmentation algorithm for WBCs in the blood smear images is proposed using multi-scale similarity measure based on the neutrosophic domain. We employ neutrosophic similarity score to measure the similarity between different color components of the blood smear image. Since we utilize different color components from different color spaces, we modify the neutrosphic score algorithm to be adaptive. Two different segmentation frameworks are proposed: one for the segmentation of nucleus, and the other for the cytoplasm of WBCs. Moreover, our proposed algorithm is applied to both healthy and non-healthy WBCs. in some cases, the single blood smear image gather between healthy and non-healthy WBCs which is considered in our proposed algorithm. Also, our segmentation algorithm is performed without any external morphological binary enhancement methods which may effect on the original shape of the WBC. Results: Different public datasets with different resolutions were used in our experiments. We evaluate the system performance based on both qualitative and quantitative measurements. The quantitative results indicates high precision rates of the segmentation performance measurement A1 = 96.5% and A2 = 97.2% of the proposed method. The average segmentation performance results for different WBCs types reach to 97.6%. Conclusion: In this paper, a method based on adaptive neutrosphic sets similarity score is proposed in order to detect WBCs from a blood smear microscopic image and segment its components (nucleus and the cytoplasm). The proposed segmentation algorithm can be utilized for fully-automated classification systems, such systems can be either for the healthy WBCs or even for non-healthy WBCs specially the leukemia cells.","['Shahin, A I', 'Guo, Yanhui', 'Amin, K M', 'Sharawi, Amr A']","['Shahin AI', 'Guo Y', 'Amin KM', 'Sharawi AA']","['Department of Biomedical Engineering, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt.0000 0004 0639 9286grid.7776.1', 'Department of Biomedical Engineering, HTI, Ramadan city, Egypt.0000 0004 0377 3877grid.462266.2', 'Department of Computer Science, University of Illinois at Springfield, Springfield, IL USA.0000 0001 0845 7273grid.266464.4', 'Department of Information Technology, Menoufia University, Menoufia, Egypt.0000 0004 0621 4712grid.411775.1', 'Department of Biomedical Engineering, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt.0000 0004 0639 9286grid.7776.1']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20171218,England,Health Inf Sci Syst,Health information science and systems,101638060,PMC5736500,['NOTNLM'],"['Adaptive neutrosophic similarity score', 'Color based segmentation', 'Neutrosophic set', 'WBCs segmentation']",2017/12/28 06:00,2017/12/28 06:01,['2017/12/28 06:00'],"['2017/08/29 00:00 [received]', '2017/11/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/12/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/12/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/28 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1007/s13755-017-0038-5 [doi]', '38 [pii]']",epublish,Health Inf Sci Syst. 2017 Dec 18;6(1):1. doi: 10.1007/s13755-017-0038-5. eCollection 2018 Dec.,,1,,,,['ORCID: 0000-0003-1814-9682'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Radiation has demonstrated genetic effects in animal models, leading to concerns over the potential hereditary effects of atomic bomb-related radiation. However, no direct analyses of whole DNA have yet been reported. We therefore investigated de novo variants in offspring of atomic-bomb survivors by whole-genome sequencing (WGS). We collected peripheral blood from three trios, each comprising a father (atomic-bomb survivor with acute radiation symptoms), a non-exposed mother, and their child, none of whom had any past history of haematological disorders. One trio of non-exposed individuals was included as a control. DNA was extracted and the numbers of de novo single nucleotide variants in the children were counted by WGS with sequencing confirmation. Gross structural variants were also analysed. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants prior to the study. There were 62, 81, and 42 de novo single nucleotide variants in the children of atomic-bomb survivors, compared with 48 in the control trio. There were no gross structural variants in any trio. These findings are in accord with previously published results that also showed no significant genetic effects of atomic-bomb radiation on second-generation survivors.","['Horai, Makiko', 'Mishima, Hiroyuki', 'Hayashida, Chisa', 'Kinoshita, Akira', 'Nakane, Yoshibumi', 'Matsuo, Tatsuki', 'Tsuruda, Kazuto', 'Yanagihara, Katsunori', 'Sato, Shinya', 'Imanishi, Daisuke', 'Imaizumi, Yoshitaka', 'Hata, Tomoko', 'Miyazaki, Yasushi', 'Yoshiura, Koh-Ichiro']","['Horai M', 'Mishima H', 'Hayashida C', 'Kinoshita A', 'Nakane Y', 'Matsuo T', 'Tsuruda K', 'Yanagihara K', 'Sato S', 'Imanishi D', 'Imaizumi Y', 'Hata T', 'Miyazaki Y', 'Yoshiura KI']","['Department of Hematology, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Atomic Bomb Disease Institute, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Human Genetics, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Atomic Bomb Disease Institute, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Human Genetics, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Atomic Bomb Disease Institute, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Human Genetics, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Atomic Bomb Disease Institute, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Health Management Center, Nagasaki Atomic Bomb Casualty Council, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Health Management Center, Nagasaki Atomic Bomb Casualty Council, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Atomic Bomb Disease Institute, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Atomic Bomb Disease Institute, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Atomic Bomb Disease Institute, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Atomic Bomb Disease Institute, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Atomic Bomb Disease Institute, Nagasaki, Japan. y-miyaza@nagasaki-u.ac.jp.', 'Department of Human Genetics, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Atomic Bomb Disease Institute, Nagasaki, Japan. kyoshi@nagasaki-u.ac.jp.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20171226,England,J Hum Genet,Journal of human genetics,9808008,,,,2017/12/28 06:00,2018/08/28 06:00,['2017/12/28 06:00'],"['2017/08/26 00:00 [received]', '2017/11/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/10/11 00:00 [revised]', '2017/12/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/08/28 06:00 [medline]', '2017/12/28 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s10038-017-0392-9 [doi]', '10.1038/s10038-017-0392-9 [pii]']",ppublish,J Hum Genet. 2018 Mar;63(3):357-363. doi: 10.1038/s10038-017-0392-9.

Phosphate has many roles in physiological functions, thus the depletion of serum phosphate could lead to impairment in multiple organ systems, which include the respiratory, cardiovascular, neurological and muscular systems and haematological and metabolic functions. Hypophosphataemia is defined as plasma phosphate level below 0.80 mmol per litre (mmol/L) and can be further divided into subgroups of mild (plasma phosphate of 0.66 to 0.79 mmol/L), moderate (plasma phosphate of 0.32 to 0.65 mmol/L) and severe (plasma phosphate of less than 0.32 mmol/L). The causes of hypophosphataemia include inadequate phosphate intake, decreased intestinal absorption, gastrointestinal or renal phosphate loss, and redistribution of phosphate into cells. Symptomatic hypophosphataemia associated with haematological malignancies has been reported infrequently. We report here a case of asymptomatic severe hypophosphataemia in a child with acute T-cell lymphoblastic leukaemia. A 14-year-old Chinese boy was diagnosed to have acute T cell lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). His serum biochemistry results were normal except inorganic phosphate and lactate dehydrogenase levels. The serum inorganic phosphate level was 0.1mmol/L and the level was low on repeated analysis. The child had no symptoms related to low phosphate levels. The possible causes of low phosphate were ruled out and urine Tmp/GFR was normal. Chemotherapy regime was started and the serum phosphate levels started to increase. Hypophosphataemia in leukaemia was attributed to shift of phosphorus into leukemic cells and excessive cellular phosphate consumption by rapidly proliferating cells. Several reports of symptomatic hypophosphataemia in myelogenous and lymphoblastic leukaemia in adults have been reported. To our knowledge this is the first case of severe asymptomatic hypophosphataemia in a child with ALL.","['Zakaria, N H', 'Sthaneshwar, P', 'Shanmugam, H']","['Zakaria NH', 'Sthaneshwar P', 'Shanmugam H']","['University Malaya, Faculty of Medicine, Department of Pathology, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. pavai@ummc.edu.my.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,Malaysia,Malays J Pathol,The Malaysian journal of pathology,8101177,,,,2017/12/28 06:00,2018/08/16 06:00,['2017/12/28 06:00'],"['2017/12/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/12/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/08/16 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Malays J Pathol. 2017 Dec;39(3):317-320.,20180815,3,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Humans', 'Hypophosphatemia/*etiology', 'Male', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*complications']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Case report and literature review.,143-146,10.3960/jslrt.17027 [doi],"Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) is a peripheral T-cell lymphoma caused by human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 infection. Although conjunctival lymphoma is commonly reported with B-cell lymphoma, it rarely occurs in cases of ATLL. A 73-year-old Japanese female patient was admitted to our institution with evidence of abnormal lymphocytes, lymphadenopathy, and lung nodular lesions. Acute type ATLL was diagnosed, and therapy following the mLSG15 protocol was initiated. At the end of the second course, new bone lesions were detected. A modified treatment regimen was scheduled, but was postponed due to the appearance of gastrointestinal symptoms. Close observation resulted in a diagnosis of cytomegalovirus enteritis. One month after the diagnosis, the patient developed pain and discomfort in her left eye, which was determined to be due to a bulbar conjunctival tumor. Pathological findings revealed conjunctival infiltration of ATLL. Mogamulizumab treatment was initiated and was successful in eradicating the conjunctival lesions after the first course. However, at the end of the third course of therapy, pancytopenia was noted. Therefore, mogamulizumab therapy was discontinued, and the patient was on follow-up observation. Although there was no relapse of the conjunctival lesions, the patient died 1 year after the initial diagnosis, following therapy resistance.","['Shimono, Joji', 'Kaino, Shigeki', 'Okada, Kohei', 'Oshimi, Kazuo', 'Ishida, Yusuke', 'Takahashi, Tatsuro', 'Miyagishima, Takuto', 'Teshima, Takanori']","['Shimono J', 'Kaino S', 'Okada K', 'Oshimi K', 'Ishida Y', 'Takahashi T', 'Miyagishima T', 'Teshima T']","['Department of Hematology, Kushiro Rosai Hospital.', 'Department of Hematology, Hokkaido University Faculty of Medicine.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, Kushiro Rosai Hospital.', 'Department of Hematology, Kushiro Rosai Hospital.', 'Department of Hematology, Hokkaido University Faculty of Medicine.', 'Department of Hematology, Kushiro Rosai Hospital.', 'Department of Pathology, Kushiro Rosai Hospital.', 'Department of Pathology, Kushiro Rosai Hospital.', 'Department of Hematology, Kushiro Rosai Hospital.', 'Department of Hematology, Hokkaido University Faculty of Medicine.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",,Japan,J Clin Exp Hematop,Journal of clinical and experimental hematopathology : JCEH,101141257,PMC6144186,['NOTNLM'],"['Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma', 'Conjunctival lymphoma', 'Ocular adnexal lymphoma']",2017/12/28 06:00,2018/08/01 06:00,['2017/12/28 06:00'],"['2017/12/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/12/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/08/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3960/jslrt.17027 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Exp Hematop. 2017;57(3):143-146. doi: 10.3960/jslrt.17027.,20180731,3,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'YI437801BE (mogamulizumab)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Conjunctiva/drug effects/pathology', 'Conjunctival Neoplasms/drug therapy/pathology/*secondary', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/diagnosis/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Lymphocytes/drug effects/pathology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RSKs (p90 ribosomal S6 kinases) have emerged as central regulators of cell migration; however, the mechanisms mediating RSK-dependent motility remain incompletely understood. We have identified a unique signaling mechanism by which RSK2 promotes cell motility through leukemia-associated RhoGEF (LARG)-dependent Rho GTPase activation. RSK2 directly interacts with LARG and nucleotide-bound Rho isoforms, but not Rac1 or Cdc42. We further show that epidermal growth factor or FBS stimulation induces association of endogenous RSK2 with LARG and LARG with RhoA. In response to these stimuli, RSK2 phosphorylates LARG at Ser1288 and thereby activates RhoA. Phosphorylation of RSK2 at threonine 577 is essential for activation of LARG-RhoA. Moreover, RSK2-mediated motility signaling depends on RhoA and -B, but not RhoC. These results establish a unique RSK2-dependent LARG-RhoA signaling module as a central organizer of directed cell migration and invasion.","['Shi, Geng-Xian', 'Yang, Won Seok', 'Jin, Ling', 'Matter, Michelle L', 'Ramos, Joe W']","['Shi GX', 'Yang WS', 'Jin L', 'Matter ML', 'Ramos JW']","['Cancer Biology Program, University of Hawaii Cancer Center, University of Hawaii at Manoa, Honolulu, HI 96813.', 'Cancer Biology Program, University of Hawaii Cancer Center, University of Hawaii at Manoa, Honolulu, HI 96813.', 'Cancer Biology Program, University of Hawaii Cancer Center, University of Hawaii at Manoa, Honolulu, HI 96813.', 'Cancer Biology Program, University of Hawaii Cancer Center, University of Hawaii at Manoa, Honolulu, HI 96813.', 'Cancer Biology Program, University of Hawaii Cancer Center, University of Hawaii at Manoa, Honolulu, HI 96813 joeramos@hawaii.edu.']",['eng'],"['P30 CA071789/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM088266/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM104984/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20171226,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,PMC5777029,['NOTNLM'],"['*ARHGEF12', '*LARG', '*RSK2', '*Rho GTPases', '*motility']",2017/12/28 06:00,2018/07/18 06:00,['2017/12/28 06:00'],"['2017/12/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/07/18 06:00 [medline]', '2017/12/28 06:00 [entrez]']","['1708584115 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1708584115 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2018 Jan 9;115(2):E190-E199. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1708584115.

Recently, the next-generation sequencing approach has allowed systematic identification of molecular features in pediatric T-ALL. Here, by performing RNA-sequencing and other genomewide analysis, we investigated the genomic landscape in 61 adult and 69 pediatric T-ALL cases. Thirty-six distinct gene fusion transcripts were identified, with SET-NUP214 being highly related to adult cases. Among 18 previously unknown fusions, ZBTB16-ABL1, TRA-SALL2, and involvement of NKX2-1 were recurrent events. ZBTB16-ABL1 functioned as a leukemogenic driver and responded to the effect of tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Among 48 genes with mutation rates >3%, 6 were newly found in T-ALL. An aberrantly overexpressed short mRNA transcript of the SLC17A9 gene was revealed in most cases with overexpressed TAL1, which predicted a poor prognosis in the adult group. Up-regulation of HOXA, MEF2C, and LYL1 was often present in adult cases, while TAL1 overexpression was detected mainly in the pediatric group. Although most gene fusions were mutually exclusive, they coexisted with gene mutations. These genetic abnormalities were correlated with deregulated gene expression markers in three subgroups. This study may further enrich the current knowledge of T-ALL molecular pathogenesis.","['Chen, Bing', 'Jiang, Lu', 'Zhong, Meng-Ling', 'Li, Jian-Feng', 'Li, Ben-Shang', 'Peng, Li-Jun', 'Dai, Yu-Ting', 'Cui, Bo-Wen', 'Yan, Tian-Qi', 'Zhang, Wei-Na', 'Weng, Xiang-Qin', 'Xie, Yin-Yin', 'Lu, Jing', 'Ren, Rui-Bao', 'Chen, Su-Ning', 'Hu, Jian-Da', 'Wu, De-Pei', 'Chen, Zhu', 'Tang, Jing-Yan', 'Huang, Jin-Yan', 'Mi, Jian-Qing', 'Chen, Sai-Juan']","['Chen B', 'Jiang L', 'Zhong ML', 'Li JF', 'Li BS', 'Peng LJ', 'Dai YT', 'Cui BW', 'Yan TQ', 'Zhang WN', 'Weng XQ', 'Xie YY', 'Lu J', 'Ren RB', 'Chen SN', 'Hu JD', 'Wu DP', 'Chen Z', 'Tang JY', 'Huang JY', 'Mi JQ', 'Chen SJ']","['State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Rui Jin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Rui Jin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Rui Jin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Rui Jin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, China.', ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Key Laboratory of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Ministry of Health, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200127, China."", 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Rui Jin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Rui Jin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Rui Jin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Rui Jin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Rui Jin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Rui Jin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Rui Jin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Rui Jin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Rui Jin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, China.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Soochow 215006, China.', 'Fujian Institute of Hematology, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, Fuzhou 350001, China.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Soochow 215006, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Rui Jin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, China;

As JMML often exhibits an aggressive course, the timing of diagnosis and treatment is critical to outcome. Areas covered: This review summarizes current approaches to diagnosis and treatment of JMML, highlighting most recent insights into genetic and epigenetic mechanisms underlying the disease, and providing an overview of novel potential therapeutic strategies. Expert commentary: At present, allogeneic HSCT remains the only potentially effective therapy, being able to cure more than 50% of patients, relapse representing the main cause of treatment failure. Prompt HSCT is recommended for all children with NF1, somatic PTPN11 and KRAS mutations, and for most children with somatic NRAS mutations. Conversely, a 'watch and wait' strategy should be adopted in children with germline CBL mutations, specific somatic NRAS mutation, and in Noonan syndrome patients, since spontaneous resolution has been reported to occur. Novel drugs targeting relevant nodes of JMML leukemogenesis have been explored in pre-HSCT window or at relapse. The use of 5-azacytidine, a DNA-hypomethylating agent reported to induce hematologic and molecular remission in some JMML children, is currently being investigated in clinical trials.","['Locatelli, Franco', 'Algeri, Mattia', 'Merli, Pietro', 'Strocchio, Luisa']","['Locatelli F', 'Algeri M', 'Merli P', 'Strocchio L']","[""a Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology , IRCCS Bambino Gesu Children's Hospital , Rome , Italy."", 'b Department of Pediatric Science , University of Pavia , Pavia , Italy.', ""a Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology , IRCCS Bambino Gesu Children's Hospital , Rome , Italy."", ""a Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology , IRCCS Bambino Gesu Children's Hospital , Rome , Italy."", ""a Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology , IRCCS Bambino Gesu Children's Hospital , Rome , Italy.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20180103,England,Expert Rev Hematol,Expert review of hematology,101485942,,['NOTNLM'],"['*5-azacytidine', '*RAS pathway', '*hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', '*juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia', '*myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative disorders', '*targeted therapy']",2017/12/28 06:00,2018/12/21 06:00,['2017/12/28 06:00'],"['2017/12/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/12/21 06:00 [medline]', '2017/12/28 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/17474086.2018.1421937 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Rev Hematol. 2018 Feb;11(2):129-143. doi: 10.1080/17474086.2018.1421937.

The transcriptional co-factor LIM domain only 2 (LMO2) and its target gene HHEX are essential for self-renewal of T cell precursors and T-ALL etiology. LMO2 directly associates with LDB1 in a large DNA-containing nuclear complex and controls the transcription of T-ALL-related genes. Recently, we reported that overexpression of the LIM-homeodomain transcription factor, Lhx2, results in liberation of the Lmo2 protein from the Lmo2-Ldb1 complex, followed by ubiquitin proteasome mediated degradation. Here, we found that proliferation of five human T-ALL-derived cell lines, including CCRF-CEM, was significantly suppressed by retroviral overexpression of Lhx2. The majority of Lhx2-transduced CCRF-CEM cells arrested in G0 phase and subsequently underwent apoptosis. Expression of LMO2 protein as well as HHEX, ERG, HES1 and MYC genes was repressed in CCRF-CEM cells by transduction with Lhx2. Lhx2-mediated growth inhibition was partially rescued by simultaneous overexpression of Lmo2; however, both the C-terminal LIM domain and the homeodomain of Lhx2 were required for its growth-suppressive activity. These data indicate that Lhx2 is capable of blocking proliferation of T-ALL-derived cells by both LMO2-dependent and -independent means. We propose Lhx2 as a new molecular tool for anti-T-ALL drug development.","['Miyashita, Kazuya', 'Kitajima, Kenji', 'Goyama, Susumu', 'Kitamura, Toshio', 'Hara, Takahiko']","['Miyashita K', 'Kitajima K', 'Goyama S', 'Kitamura T', 'Hara T']","['Stem Cell Project, Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science, 2-1-6 Kamikitazawa, Setagaya-ku, Tokyo 156-8506, Japan; Division of Cellular Therapy, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, 4-6-1 Shirokanedai, Minato-ku, Tokyo 108-8639, Japan.', 'Stem Cell Project, Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science, 2-1-6 Kamikitazawa, Setagaya-ku, Tokyo 156-8506, Japan.', 'Division of Cellular Therapy, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, 4-6-1 Shirokanedai, Minato-ku, Tokyo 108-8639, Japan.', 'Division of Cellular Therapy, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, 4-6-1 Shirokanedai, Minato-ku, Tokyo 108-8639, Japan.', 'Stem Cell Project, Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science, 2-1-6 Kamikitazawa, Setagaya-ku, Tokyo 156-8506, Japan; Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, 1-5-45 Yushima, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8510, Japan.

Then in 2017, a wave of new drugs suddenly became approved. This review serves to introduce the newly available drugs, discuss their impact upon therapy, and highlight additional novel agents that are waiting in the wings. RECENT FINDINGS: Newly approved agents in AML include a tyrosine kinase inhibitor for patients with FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) mutations, an inhibitor of mutant isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH2), and two novel agents using antibody-delivered or liposome-delivered cytotoxics. All of these new agents have demonstrable activity in AML and several have improved survival in randomized studies. In addition to these agents, promising data from other inhibitors of FLT3, IDH1, and B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) will be discussed. SUMMARY: Response, survival, and symptom burden of AML therapy are all improving through novel agents. As many of the newly approved drugs benefit-specific genetic subsets, a new priority has emerged to increase the speed of diagnostic genomic studies as a means to guide frontline therapy. This will ensure patients are optimally categorized and treated with to the most rational agents.","['Perl, Alexander E']",['Perl AE'],"['Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology-Oncology and the Abramson Cancer Center at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,,,,2017/12/27 06:00,2019/01/12 06:00,['2017/12/27 06:00'],"['2017/12/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/12 06:00 [medline]', '2017/12/27 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/MOH.0000000000000411 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2018 Mar;25(2):81-89. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0000000000000411.,20190111,2,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cytotoxins)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 1.1.1.41 (IDH2, human)', 'EC 1.1.1.41 (Isocitrate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Cytotoxins/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Isocitrate Dehydrogenase/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Mutation', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

STAG2 is the most commonly mutated cohesin member in AML as well as solid tumors. STAG2 is recurrently, mutated in Ewing's Sarcoma, bladder cancer, and glioblastoma, and is one of only ten genes known to be recurrently mutated in over four distinct tissue types of human cancer RECENT FINDINGS: The cohesin complex, a multiprotein ring, is canonically known to align and stabilize replicated chromosomes prior to cell division. Although initially thought to lead to unequal chromosomal separation in dividing cells, data in myeloid malignancies show this is not observed in cohesin mutant MDS/AML, either in large patient cohorts or mouse models. Mounting evidence supports a potential alternate mechanism whereby drivers of cell-type specific gene expression and hematopoietic development are impaired through alteration in three-dimensional nuclear organization and gene structure. SUMMARY: Understanding the functional consequences of cohesin mutations in regulating lineage-specific and signal-dependent defects and in myeloid transformation will identify novel pathophysiologic mechanisms of disease and inform the development of novel therapeutic targets.","['Viny, Aaron D', 'Levine, Ross L']","['Viny AD', 'Levine RL']","['Human Oncology & Pathogenesis Program, Center for Hematologic Malignancies, and Leukemia Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, USA.']",['eng'],['P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,PMC6601335,,,2017/12/27 06:00,2019/01/12 06:00,['2017/12/27 06:00'],"['2017/12/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/12 06:00 [medline]', '2017/12/27 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/MOH.0000000000000405 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2018 Mar;25(2):61-66. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0000000000000405.,20190111,2,"['0 (Antigens, Nuclear)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (STAG2 protein, human)', '0 (cohesins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Nuclear/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone/*genetics/metabolism', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', '*Mutation', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics/metabolism']",,,,['NIHMS1037922'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study evaluated the effects of the synthetic MERTK inhibitors UNC569 and UNC1062 on in vitro growth of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four AML cell lines expressing MERTK were treated with UNC569 and UNC1062 and analyzed for cell proliferation, immunoblotting, and gene expression. The effects of MERTK knockdown were also evaluated. RESULTS: Treatment with the inhibitors suppressed cell growth and induced apoptosis in all cell lines. OCI/AML5 and TMD7 cells, in which MERTK was constitutively phosphorylated by autocrine mechanisms, were highly susceptible to these inhibitors. The treatment reduced the phosphorylation of MERTK and its down-stream signalling molecules, v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog 1 (AKT) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). Similar effects were observed after MERTK knockdown. The inhibitors and the knockdown caused similar changes in mRNA expression. CONCLUSION: These MERTK inhibitors are potential molecular-targeted drugs for treating AML expressing constitutively phosphorylated MERTK.","['Koda, Yuki', 'Itoh, Mai', 'Tohda, Shuji']","['Koda Y', 'Itoh M', 'Tohda S']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan tohda.mlab@tmd.ac.jp.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,,['NOTNLM'],"['*MERTK', '*apoptosis', '*leukaemia']",2017/12/27 06:00,2018/01/06 06:00,['2017/12/27 06:00'],"['2017/09/12 00:00 [received]', '2017/10/29 00:00 [revised]', '2017/10/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/12/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/12/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/06 06:00 [medline]']","['38/1/199 [pii]', '10.21873/anticanres.12208 [doi]']",ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2018 Jan;38(1):199-204. doi: 10.21873/anticanres.12208.,20180105,1,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Morpholines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (UNC1062)', '0 (UNC569)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (MERTK protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (c-Mer Tyrosine Kinase)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Morpholines/*pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Pyrazoles/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Sulfonamides/*pharmacology', 'c-Mer Tyrosine Kinase/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism']",,"['Copyright(c) 2018, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.', 'Delinasios), All rights reserved.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the current study, we report on investigation of the distribution of curcumin and metabolism to THC in PBMC from healthy individuals and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients following exposure to Lipocurc (liposomal curcumin). Materials and Methods: The time and temperature-dependent distribution of liposomal curcumin and metabolism to tetrahydrocurcumin (THC) were measured in vitro in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) obtained from healthy individuals, PBMCHI(cryopreserved and freshly isolated PBMC) and CLL patients (cryopreserved PBMC) with lymphocyte counts ranging from 17-58x10(6) cells/ml (PBMCCLL,Grp 1) and >150x10(6) cells/ml (PBMCCLL,Grp 2). PBMC were incubated in plasma protein supplemented media with Lipocurc for 2-16 min at 37 degrees C and 4 degrees C and the cell and medium levels of curcumin determined by LC-MS/MS. Results: PBMC from CLL patients displayed a 2.2-2.6-fold higher distribution of curcumin compared to PBMCHICurcumin distribution into PBMCCLL, Grp 1/Grp 2 ranged from 384.75 - 574.50 ng/g w.w. of cell pellet and was greater compared to PBMCHIthat ranged from 122.27-220.59 ng/g w.w. of cell pellet following incubation for up to 15-16 min at 37 degrees C. The distribution of curcumin into PBMCCLL,Grp 2 was time-dependent in comparison to PBMCHIwhich did not display a time-dependence and there was no temperature-dependence for curcumin distribution in either cell type. Curcumin was metabolized to THC in PBMC. The metabolism of curcumin to THC was not markedly different between PBMCHI(range=23.94-42.04 ng/g w.w. cell pellet) and PBMCCLL,Grp 1/Grp 2 (range=23.08-48.22 ng/g. w.w. cell pellet). However, a significantly greater time and temperature-dependence was noted for THC in PBMCCLL,Grp 2 compared to PBMCHIConclusion: Curcumin distribution into PBMC from CLL patients was higher compared to PBMC from healthy individuals, while metabolism to THC was similar. The potential for a greater distribution of curcumin into PBMC from CLL patients may be of therapeutic benefit.","['Bolger, Gordon T', 'Licollari, Albert', 'Tan, Aimin', 'Greil, Richard', 'Pleyer, Lisa', 'Vcelar, Brigitta', 'Majeed, Muhammad', 'Sordillo, Peter']","['Bolger GT', 'Licollari A', 'Tan A', 'Greil R', 'Pleyer L', 'Vcelar B', 'Majeed M', 'Sordillo P']","['Nucro-Technics, Scarborough, ON, Canada psordillo@signpathpharma.com bolger@nucro-technics.com.', 'Nucro-Technics, Scarborough, ON, Canada.', 'Nucro-Technics, Scarborough, ON, Canada.', 'IIIrd Medical Department with Hematology and Medical Oncology, Oncologic Center, Paracelsus Medical University, Salzburg, Salzburg Cancer Research Institute, Cancer Cluster Salzburg, Salzburg, Austria.', 'IIIrd Medical Department with Hematology and Medical Oncology, Oncologic Center, Paracelsus Medical University, Salzburg, Salzburg Cancer Research Institute, Cancer Cluster Salzburg, Salzburg, Austria.', 'Polymun Scientific Immunbiologische Forschung GmbH, Klosterneuburg, Austria.', 'Sabinsa Corporation, East Windsor, NJ, U.S.A.', 'SignPath Pharma Inc., New York, NY, U.S.A. psordillo@signpathpharma.com bolger@nucro-technics.com.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Curcumin', '*blood cells', '*chronic lymphocytic leukemia', '*tetrahydrocurcumin']",2017/12/27 06:00,2018/01/02 06:00,['2017/12/27 06:00'],"['2017/10/20 00:00 [received]', '2017/11/02 00:00 [revised]', '2017/11/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/12/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/12/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/02 06:00 [medline]']","['38/1/121 [pii]', '10.21873/anticanres.12199 [doi]']",ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2018 Jan;38(1):121-130. doi: 10.21873/anticanres.12199.,20180101,1,"['0 (Liposomes)', '00U0645U03 (tetrahydrocurcumin)', 'IT942ZTH98 (Curcumin)']",IM,"['Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Curcumin/*administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*metabolism', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/*metabolism', 'Liposomes']",,"['Copyright(c) 2018, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.', 'Delinasios), All rights reserved.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The field has continued to advance rapidly since then, and the past 2 years have witnessed important changes to the classification of MPN and diagnostic criteria for polycythemia vera (PV), novel insights into the mechanisms of bone marrow fibrosis in primary myelofibrosis (PMF), increasing appreciation of the biologic differences between essential thrombocythemia (ET), prefibrotic and overt PMF, and between primary and post-PV/ET myelofibrosis (MF). Additionally, the mechanisms through which mutant CALR drives JAK-STAT pathway activation and oncogenic transformation are now better understood. Although mastocytosis is no longer included under the broad heading of MPN in the 2016 revision to the World Health Organization classification, an important milestone in mastocytosis research was reached in 2017 with the regulatory approval of midostaurin for patients with advanced systemic mastocytosis (AdvSM).

These complications in other tyrosine kinase inhibitors are revealed as unknown. Materials and methods: We determined the prevalence of PAOD in patients with CML as compared with matched-control population by cross-sectional case-control study. Peripheral artery occlusive disease was screened by ankle-brachial index (ABI). Results: In total, 78 CML and 156 matched-control patients were included. The median age was 55 years. In all, 61 (78.2%) were on imatinib and 13 (16.7%) were on nilotinib, whereas 4 patients (5.2%) were on dasatinib. Prevalence of low ABI (<0.9) was 9.0%, and nilotinib users had the highest prevalence of low ABI of 30.7%. All cases with low ABI were not shown to be clinically overt of PAOD. There were well-balanced characteristics between cases of CML and matched control except in higher levels of hypercholesterolemia in the control. Interestingly, CML had more amounts of pathologic ABI than the control (odds ratio: 2.09, 95% confidence interval: 0.71-6.21), and diagnosis of diabetes found it to be independent of the risk of PAOD.

MTT assay showed that Pd@W.tea NPs (IC50 =0.006 muM) were more antiproliferative toward the human leukemia (MOLT-4) cells than the W.tea extract (IC50 =0.894 muM), doxorubicin (IC50 =2.133 muM), or cisplatin (IC50 =0.013 muM), whereas they were relatively innocuous for normal human fibroblast (HDF-a) cells. The anticancer cell effects of Pd@W.tea NPs are mediated through the induction of apoptosis and G2/M cell-cycle arrest.","['Azizi, Susan', 'Mahdavi Shahri, Mahnaz', 'Rahman, Heshu Sulaiman', 'Rahim, Raha Abdul', 'Rasedee, Abdullah', 'Mohamad, Rosfarizan']","['Azizi S', 'Mahdavi Shahri M', 'Rahman HS', 'Rahim RA', 'Rasedee A', 'Mohamad R']","['Department of Bioprocess Technology, Faculty of Biotechnology and Biomolecular Sciences, Universiti Putra Malaysia, UPM Serdang, Selangor, Malaysia.', 'Department of Chemistry, Shiraz Branch, Islamic Azad University, Shiraz, Iran.', 'College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Sulaimani, Sulaimani Nwe.', 'College of Health Science, Komar University of Science and Technology (KUST), Chaq-Chaq Qularaise, Sulaimani City, Iraq.', 'Faculty of Veterinary Medicine.', 'Department of Cell and Molecular Biology, Faculty of Biotechnology and Biomolecular Sciences.', 'Faculty of Veterinary Medicine.', 'Department of Bioprocess Technology, Faculty of Biotechnology and Biomolecular Sciences, Universiti Putra Malaysia, UPM Serdang, Selangor, Malaysia.', 'Laboratory of Biopolymer and Derivatives, Institute of Tropical Forestry and Forest Products, Universiti Putra Malaysia, UPM Serdang, Selangor, Malaysia.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20171214,New Zealand,Int J Nanomedicine,International journal of nanomedicine,101263847,PMC5734231,['NOTNLM'],"['cytotoxicity', 'green synthesis', 'leukemic cells', 'medical application', 'nanobiotechnology', 'palladium nanoparticles', 'white tea']",2017/12/26 06:00,2018/03/27 06:00,['2017/12/26 06:00'],"['2017/12/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/12/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/27 06:00 [medline]']","['10.2147/IJN.S149371 [doi]', 'ijn-12-8841 [pii]']",epublish,Int J Nanomedicine. 2017 Dec 14;12:8841-8853. doi: 10.2147/IJN.S149371. eCollection 2017.,20180326,,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Phenols)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '5TWQ1V240M (Palladium)']",IM,"['Anti-Bacterial Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Antioxidants/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Camellia sinensis/*chemistry', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Escherichia coli/drug effects', 'Flavonoids/analysis', 'Green Chemistry Technology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/pathology', 'Microscopy, Electron, Scanning', 'Microscopy, Electron, Transmission', 'Nanoparticles/*chemistry', 'Palladium/*chemistry', 'Phenols/analysis', 'Plant Extracts/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Staphylococcus epidermidis/drug effects']",,,['Disclosure The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This health problem is caused due to the accumulation of mature B-lymphocytes in the peripheral blood and bone marrow. In the course of cancer, CD4+ T cells become ""exhausted"" and characterized with poor effector functions and the expression of multiple inhibitory receptors. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the frequency and functional properties of exhausted CD4+ T lymphocytes in patients with CLL. METHODS: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were obtained from 25 untreated CLL patients and 15 healthy volunteers. CLL patients were clinically classified according to the Rai staging system. The frequency of CD4+/Tim-3+/PD-1+ cells was obtained by flow cytometry. To evaluate cell proliferation and cytokine production, CD4+ T cells were isolated and stimulated with phytohemagglutinin and PMA/ionomycin. Concentrations of IL-2, IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, and IL-10 were measured in the culture supernatants of stimulated cells by the ELISA technique. RESULTS: The percentage of CD4+/Tim-3+/PD-1+ cells was significantly higher in CLL patients than that of healthy controls. CD4+ T cells from CLL patients showed lower proliferative responses, a lower production of IL-2, IFN-gamma, and TNF-alpha, and a higher production of IL-10, compared to healthy controls. CD4+ T cells from CLL patients in advanced clinical stages showed more exhaustion features than those of early stages. CONCLUSION: Given that the exhaustion phase of T cells can be reversible, targeted blocking of immune inhibitory molecules could be a promising tool to restore the host immune responses against leukemic cells in CLL.","['Allahmoradi, Esmaeil', 'Taghiloo, Saeid', 'Tehrani, Mohsen', 'Hossein-Nattaj, Hadi', 'Janbabaei, Ghasem', 'Shekarriz, Ramin', 'Asgarian-Omran, Hossein']","['Allahmoradi E', 'Taghiloo S', 'Tehrani M', 'Hossein-Nattaj H', 'Janbabaei G', 'Shekarriz R', 'Asgarian-Omran H']","['Department of Immunology, School of Medicine, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences, Sari, Iran.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Iran,Iran J Immunol,Iranian journal of immunology : IJI,101282932,,,,2017/12/26 06:00,2018/08/09 06:00,['2017/12/26 06:00'],"['2017/12/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/12/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/08/09 06:00 [medline]']","['01 [pii]', 'IJIv14i4A1 [doi]']",ppublish,Iran J Immunol. 2017 Dec;14(4):257-269. doi: IJIv14i4A1.,20180808,4,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (HAVCR2 protein, human)', '0 (Hepatitis A Virus Cellular Receptor 2)', '0 (PDCD1 protein, human)', '0 (Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Carcinogenesis', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Clonal Anergy', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Hepatitis A Virus Cellular Receptor 2/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/*methods', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor/metabolism']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells produce angiogenic factors, which likely contribute to this remodeling, but anti-angiogenic therapies do not improve AML patient outcomes. Using intravital microscopy, we found that AML progression leads to differential remodeling of vasculature in central and endosteal bone marrow regions. Endosteal AML cells produce pro-inflammatory and anti-angiogenic cytokines and gradually degrade endosteal endothelium, stromal cells, and osteoblastic cells, whereas central marrow remains vascularized and splenic vascular niches expand. Remodeled endosteal regions have reduced capacity to support non-leukemic HSCs, correlating with loss of normal hematopoiesis. Preserving endosteal endothelium with the small molecule deferoxamine or a genetic approach rescues HSCs loss, promotes chemotherapeutic efficacy, and enhances survival. These findings suggest that preventing degradation of the endosteal vasculature may improve current paradigms for treating AML.","['Duarte, Delfim', 'Hawkins, Edwin D', 'Akinduro, Olufolake', 'Ang, Heather', 'De Filippo, Katia', 'Kong, Isabella Y', 'Haltalli, Myriam', 'Ruivo, Nicola', 'Straszkowski, Lenny', 'Vervoort, Stephin J', 'McLean, Catriona', 'Weber, Tom S', 'Khorshed, Reema', 'Pirillo, Chiara', 'Wei, Andrew', 'Ramasamy, Saravana K', 'Kusumbe, Anjali P', 'Duffy, Ken', 'Adams, Ralf H', 'Purton, Louise E', 'Carlin, Leo M', 'Lo Celso, Cristina']","['Duarte D', 'Hawkins ED', 'Akinduro O', 'Ang H', 'De Filippo K', 'Kong IY', 'Haltalli M', 'Ruivo N', 'Straszkowski L', 'Vervoort SJ', 'McLean C', 'Weber TS', 'Khorshed R', 'Pirillo C', 'Wei A', 'Ramasamy SK', 'Kusumbe AP', 'Duffy K', 'Adams RH', 'Purton LE', 'Carlin LM', 'Lo Celso C']","['Department of Life Sciences, Sir Alexander Fleming Building, Imperial College London, SW7 2AZ London, UK; The Francis Crick Institute, WC2A 3LY London, UK.

Since this complex pathway is crucial to cell functions such as growth, proliferation, and survival, inhibition of this pathway would be postulated to inhibit leukemia initiation and propagation. Inhibition of the mTORC1 pathway has met with limited success in AML due to multiple resistance mechanisms including direct insensitivity of the mTORC1 complex, feedback activation of the PI3k/Akt signaling network, insulin growth factor-1 (IGF-1) activation of PI3K, and others. This review explores the role of mTOR inhibition in AML, mechanisms of resistance, and means to improve outcomes through use of dual mTORC1/2 inhibitors or dual TORC/PI3K inhibitors. How these inhibitors interface with currently available therapies in AML will require additional preclinical experiments and conduct of well-designed clinical trials.","['Herschbein, Lauren', 'Liesveld, Jane L']","['Herschbein L', 'Liesveld JL']","['Department of Medicine, The James P.

Tet2 loss and Nras mutation cooperatively led to decrease in negative regulators of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation, including Spry2, thereby causing synergistic activation of MAPK signaling by epigenetic silencing. Tet2/Nras double-mutant leukemia showed preferential sensitivity to MAPK kinase (MEK) inhibition in both mouse model and patient samples.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cytotoxicity of cycloartobiloxanthone was evaluated by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5 diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay against four human lung cancer cell lines (H23, H460, H292 and A549) and their half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) were assessed. Apoptotic induction in H460 cells was investigated by Hoechst 33342/propidium iodide (PI) staining assay and protein hallmarks of mitochondria-dependent apoptotic pathway were examined by western blot analysis. RESULTS: Cycloartobiloxanthone exhibited potent cytotoxic effect on both small and non-small cell lung cancer cells. Nuclear Hoechst/PI staining revealed that apoptotic cell death was the main mechanism of toxicity of cycloartobiloxanthone. The apoptosis-inducing potency of cycloartobiloxanthone was comparable to those of standard anticancer drugs cisplatin and etoposide at the same concentration. Protein analysis further showed that apoptosis was mediated via mitochondria-dependent pathway. p53 was activated in cells treated with cycloartobiloxanthone. Subsequently, pro-apoptotic protein B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2)-associated X protein (BAX) was found to be significantly increased, concomitantly with the decrease of anti-apoptotic proteins BCL2 and myeloid cell leukemia 1 (MCL1). Moreover, markers of the intrinsic apoptosis pathway, namely activated caspase-9, activated caspase-3, and cleaved poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (PARP), dramatically increased in cycloartobiloxanthone-treated cells compared to the non-treated controls. CONCLUSION: Cycloartobiloxanthone has anticancer activity against human lung cancer cells by triggering mitochondrial apoptotic caspase-dependent mechanism. This compound might have promising effects for cancer therapy.","['Losuwannarak, Nattanan', 'Sritularak, Boonchoo', 'Chanvorachote, Pithi']","['Losuwannarak N', 'Sritularak B', 'Chanvorachote P']","['Department of Pharmacology and Physiology, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand.', 'Cell-based Drug and Health Product Development Research Unit, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand.', 'Department of Pharmacognosy and Pharmaceutical Botany, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Physiology, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand pithi_chan@yahoo.com.', 'Cell-based Drug and Health Product Development Research Unit, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Greece,In Vivo,"In vivo (Athens, Greece)",8806809,PMC5892644,['NOTNLM'],"['*BAX', '*Cycloartobiloxanthone', '*MCL1', '*apoptosis', '*lung cancer', '*mitochondria-dependent apoptotic pathway']",2017/12/25 06:00,2018/08/14 06:00,['2017/12/25 06:00'],"['2017/09/04 00:00 [received]', '2017/10/10 00:00 [revised]', '2017/10/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/12/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/12/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/08/14 06:00 [medline]']","['32/1/71 [pii]', '10.21873/invivo.11206 [doi]']",ppublish,In Vivo. 2018 Jan-Feb;32(1):71-78. doi: 10.21873/invivo.11206.,20180813,1,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (cycloartobiloxanthone)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['A549 Cells', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/metabolism', 'Artocarpus/chemistry', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Flavonoids/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/metabolism/pathology', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Molecular Structure', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects']",,"['Copyright(c) 2018, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.', 'Delinasios), All rights reserved.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our results indicated that DES induced caspase-dependent apoptosis in a human T-ALL cell line (Jurkat cells), while exerting no significant cytotoxicity in normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Phytohaemagglutinin and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate induced interleukin (IL)-2 production and activation of NF-kappaB signaling pathways, which were both inhibited by DES. Moreover, DES exerted synergistic effects with CX-4945 on proliferation and IL-2 production in Jurkat cells. Our results demonstrated that DES exerts anti-proliferative and immunosuppressive effects through inhibition of CK2 and the NF-kappaB signaling pathway in human T-ALL Jurkat cells.","['Jung, Jung-Il', 'Park, Kyeong-Yong', 'Kim, Soon Ae', 'Kim, Jiyeon']","['Jung JI', 'Park KY', 'Kim SA', 'Kim J']","['Department of Biomedical Laboratory Science, School of Medicine, Eulji University, Daejeon 34824, Republic of Korea.

However, the benefit of consolidation chemotherapy remains uncertain in patients undergoing alloHCT. We compared clinical outcomes of 524 adult patients with ALL in CR1 who received >/=2 (n = 109), 1 (n = 93), or 0 cycles (n = 322) of consolidation before myeloablative alloHCT from 2008 to 2012. As expected, time to alloHCT was longer with increasing cycles of consolidation. Patients receiving >/=2, 1, or 0 cycles of consolidation had an adjusted 3-year cumulative incidence of relapse of 20%, 27%, and 22%; 1-year transplant-related mortality (TRM) of 16%, 18%, and 23%; adjusted 3-year leukemia-free survival (LFS) of 54%, 48%, and 47%; and 3-year overall survival (OS) of 63%, 59%, and 54% (all P values >.40). Multivariable analysis confirmed that consolidation was not prognostic for LFS (relative risk, 1.20, 95% confidence interval, .86 to 1.67; P = .28 for no consolidation; RR, 1.18, 95% confidence interval, .79 to 1.76; P = .41 for 1 cycle versus >/=2 cycles = reference). Similarly, consolidation was not associated with OS, relapse, TRM, or graft-versus-host disease. We conclude that consolidation chemotherapy does not appear to provide added benefit in adult ALL patients with available donors who undergo myeloablative alloHCT in CR1.","['Bejanyan, Nelli', 'Zhang, Mei-Jie', 'Wang, Hai-Lin', 'Lazaryan, Aleksandr', 'de Lima, Marcos', 'Marks, David I', 'Sandmaier, Brenda M', 'Bachanova, Veronika', 'Rowe, Jacob', 'Tallman, Martin', 'Kebriaei, Partow', 'Kharfan-Dabaja, Mohamed', 'Peter Gale, Robert', 'Lazarus, Hillard M', 'Ustun, Celalettin', 'Copelan, Edward', 'Ky Hamilton, Betty', 'Schiller, Gary', 'Hogan, William', 'Hashmi, Shahrukh', 'Seftel, Matthew', 'Kanakry, Christopher G', 'Olsson, Richard F', 'Martino, Rodrigo', 'Saber, Wael', 'Khoury, H Jean', 'Weisdorf, Daniel J']","['Bejanyan N', 'Zhang MJ', 'Wang HL', 'Lazaryan A', 'de Lima M', 'Marks DI', 'Sandmaier BM', 'Bachanova V', 'Rowe J', 'Tallman M', 'Kebriaei P', 'Kharfan-Dabaja M', 'Peter Gale R', 'Lazarus HM', 'Ustun C', 'Copelan E', 'Ky Hamilton B', 'Schiller G', 'Hogan W', 'Hashmi S', 'Seftel M', 'Kanakry CG', 'Olsson RF', 'Martino R', 'Saber W', 'Khoury HJ', 'Weisdorf DJ']","['Division of Hematology, Oncology and Transplantation, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota.

After ruxolitinib failure, however, there are few therapeutic options. We assessed the efficacy and safety of momelotinib, a JAK 1 and JAK 2 inhibitor, versus best available therapy (BAT) in patients with myelofibrosis who had suboptimal responses or haematological toxic effects with ruxolitinib. METHODS: In this randomised, phase 3, open-label trial, patients were screened for eligibility from 52 clinical centres in Canada, France, Germany, Israel, Italy, Spain, the UK, and the USA. Patients who had myelofibrosis and previous ruxolitinib treatment for at least 28 days who either required red blood cell transfusions while on ruxolitinib or ruxolitinib dose reduction to less than 20 mg twice a day with at least one of grade 3 thrombocytopenia, anaemia, or bleeding at grade 3 or worse, with palpable spleen of at least 5 cm and without grade 2 or greater peripheral neuropathy were included in the study. Patients were randomly assigned (2:1) to either 24 weeks of open-label momelotinib 200 mg once a day or BAT (which could include ruxolitinib, chemotherapy, steroids, no treatment, or other standard interventions), after which all patients could receive extended momelotinib treatment. Patients were randomly assigned to treatment by an interactive web response system and the randomisation was stratified by transfusion dependence and by baseline total symptom score (TSS). Results were analysed on an intention-to-treat basis. The primary endpoint was a reduction by at least 35% in the spleen volume at 24 weeks compared with baseline. Safety analyses included adverse event monitoring. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02101268. FINDINGS: Between June 19, 2014, and July 28, 2016, 156 patients were recruited to the study; 104 received momelotinib and 52 received BAT. BAT was ruxolitinib in 46 (89%) of 52 patients. 73 (70%) of 104 patients in the momelotinib group and 40 (77%) of 52 patients in the BAT group completed the 24-week treatment phase. Seven (7%) of 104 patients in the momelotinib group and three (6%) of 52 in the BAT group had a reduction in the spleen volume by at least 35% compared with baseline (proportion difference [Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel method], 0.01; 95% CI -0.09 to 0.10), p=0.90). The most common grade 3 or worse adverse events were anaemia (14 [14%] of 104 in the momelotinib group vs seven [14%] of 52 in the BAT group), thrombocytopenia (seven [7%] vs three [6%]), and abdominal pain (one [1%] vs three [6%]). Peripheral neuropathy occurred in 11 (11%) of 104 patients receiving momelotinib (one of which was grade 3) and in no patients in the BAT group. Serious events were reported for 36 (35%) patients in the momelotinib group and 12 (23%) of patients in the BAT group. Deaths due to adverse events were reported for six patients (6%) receiving momelotinib (acute myeloid leukaemia [n=2], respiratory failure [n=2, with one considered possibly related to momelotinib], cardiac arrest [n=1, considered possibly related to momelotinib], and bacterial sepsis [n=1]); and four patients (8%) receiving BAT (lung adenocarcinoma [n=1], myelofibrosis [n=1], and sepsis [n=2]). INTERPRETATION: In patients with myelofibrosis previously treated with ruxolitinib, momelotinib was not superior to BAT for the reduction of spleen size by at least 35% compared with baseline.

We assessed the efficacy and safety of rituximab maintenance treatment versus observation for elderly patients in remission after front-line abbreviated induction by fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab (FCR). METHODS: This randomised, open-label, multicentre phase 3 trial at 89 centres in France enrolled treatment-naive and fit patients aged 65 years or older with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia without del(17p). Eligible patients had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-1 and adequate renal and hepatic function. Patients in response to complete induction treatment with four monthly courses of full-dose FCR with two interim rituximab doses on day 14 of cycles 1 and 2 (oral fludarabine [40 mg/m(2) per day] and oral cyclophosphamide [250 mg/m(2) per day] for the first 3 days of each cycle, rituximab at 375 mg/m(2) intravenously on day 0 of cycle 1 and subsequently at 500 mg/m(2) on day 14 of cycle 1, days 1 and 14 of cycle 2, and day 1 of cycles 3 and 4) were eligible for randomisation. Recovery from FCR toxicity and patient willingness to continue the trial were mandatory. We randomly assigned (1:1) patients to either receive intravenous rituximab (500 mg/m(2)) every 8 weeks for up to 2 years or undergo observation, with a central computer-generated randomisation list using randomly permuted blocks of variable sizes. Randomisation was stratified by IGHV mutational status, the presence or absence of del(11q), and response level to induction treatment. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival, with the objective to assess the superiority of rituximab maintenance relative to observation. The final analysis was done in the intention-to-treat population. Safety was analysed in all patients who received at least one dose of study drug in the rituximab group and in all patients in the observation group. This trial is closed to accrual whilst continuing patient follow-up. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00645606. FINDINGS: Between Dec 14, 2007, and Feb 18, 2014, 542 patients were enrolled, of whom 525 started FCR induction. Between June 10, 2008, and Aug 14, 2014, 409 (78%) patients were randomly assigned to rituximab maintenance (n=202) or observation (n=207). Four (2%) patients in the rituximab group did not receive the allocated treatment (progressive disease [n=1], adverse events [n=3]). After a median follow-up of 47.7 months (IQR 30.4-65.8), median progression-free survival in the rituximab group (59.3 months, 95% CI 49.6-not estimable) was improved compared with the observation group (49.0 months, 39.9-60.5; hazard ratio 0.55, 95% CI 0.40-0.75; p=0.0002). Neutropenia and grade 3-4 infections were more common with rituximab maintenance (105 [53%] of 198 patients vs 74 [36%] of 207 patients and 38 [19%] vs 21 [10%], respectively) during the study. The most common grade 3-4 infection was lower respiratory tract infection (24 [12%] vs eight [4%]). The incidence of second cancers, except basal cell carcinoma, was similar in both groups (29 [15%] vs 23 [11%]). Deaths were related to adverse events for 23 (11%) patients in the rituximab group and 16 (8%) in the observation group. INTERPRETATION: 2-year maintenance rituximab in selected elderly patients improves progression-free survival and shows an acceptable safety profile. Immunotherapy maintenance strategy is a relevant option in front-line treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, even in the age of targeted therapy.

Various toxic effects of LPS have been extensively reported, mainly on the toxicity of LPS in cellular level, macrophages or tumor cells, etc. This work aimed on the impact of LPS on mast cell metabolism, which focused on LPS-induced cellular metabolic profiles. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) based metabolomics strategy was implemented for the endo-metabolites detection in rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) cells, treated with 10mug/mL LPS for 24h, along with multiple time-dose tests of cells viability/apoptosis. Significantly changes metabolites were mainly involved the metabolism of glycine, serine, threonine and the biosynthesis of phenylalanine, tyrosine, tryptophan and pentose phosphate pathway. The endo-metabolism results illustrated that LPS treatment led to downregulation of glycine, serine and threonine metabolism besides pentose phosphate pathway in RBL-2H3 cells. This novel insight into LPS cellular metabolism, provides some heuristic guidance for elucidating the underlying mechanism of LPS-mediated disease.","['Cui, Fangchao', 'Zhu, Pei', 'Ji, Jian', 'Blazenovic, Ivana', 'Gholami, Morteza', 'Zhang, Yinzhi', 'Sun, Xiulan']","['Cui F', 'Zhu P', 'Ji J', 'Blazenovic I', 'Gholami M', 'Zhang Y', 'Sun X']","['School of Food Science, State Key Laboratory of Food Science and Technology, National Engineering Research Center for Functional Foods, School of Food Science Synergetic Innovation Center of Food Safety and Nutrition, Jiangnan University, Wuxi, Jiangsu 214122, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Dairy Biotechnology, Shanghai Engineering Research Center of Dairy Biotechnology, Dairy Research Institute, Bright Dairy & Food Co., Ltd., Shanghai 200436, China.', 'School of Food Science, State Key Laboratory of Food Science and Technology, National Engineering Research Center for Functional Foods, School of Food Science Synergetic Innovation Center of Food Safety and Nutrition, Jiangnan University, Wuxi, Jiangsu 214122, China.', 'West Coast Metabolomics Center, UC Davis, 95616 Davis, CA, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Sciences, Golestan University, Gorgan, Iran.', 'School of Food Science, State Key Laboratory of Food Science and Technology, National Engineering Research Center for Functional Foods, School of Food Science Synergetic Innovation Center of Food Safety and Nutrition, Jiangnan University, Wuxi, Jiangsu 214122, China.', 'School of Food Science, State Key Laboratory of Food Science and Technology, National Engineering Research Center for Functional Foods, School of Food Science Synergetic Innovation Center of Food Safety and Nutrition, Jiangnan University, Wuxi, Jiangsu 214122, China.

Consequently, BLV control is becoming more favorable; however, BLV control cannot be successful without identifying infected animals. Bovicheck BLV (Biovet, Saint-Hyacinthe, QC, Canada) is currently the only assay licensed by the Canadian Centre for Veterinary Biologics. The first goal of this study was, therefore, to determine the reproducibility of the Bovicheck BLV assay for serum samples derived from Canadian cattle. The second goal was to evaluate and compare 5 different ELISA and determine their test characteristics using serum samples from Canadian herds. The considered ELISA were Bovicheck BLV, ID Screen BLV Competition (IDvet, Grabels, France), Idexx Leukosis Serum X2 Ab Test (Idexx Europe B.V., Hoofddorp, the Netherlands), Svanovir BLV gp51-Ab (Svanova, Uppsala, Sweden), and the Serelisa BLV Ab Mono Indirect (Synbiotics, Lyon, France). Eighty serum samples from Canadian cattle provided by Prairie Diagnostic Services (PDS; Saskatoon, SK, Canada) and an additional 80 serum samples from Canadian dairy and beef herds were used for the study. The Bovicheck BLV assay yielded the same results for all PDS-derived samples, implying a high level of reproducibility and robustness of this assay. Additionally, the comparison of the assays' results showed high agreement between assays, with Cohen's kappa values between kappa = 0.91 and kappa = 1. Furthermore, using original test results of the field samples as true status, relative diagnostic sensitivity and specificity were calculated. Relative diagnostic sensitivity of all tests was 100%. False-positive results were probable; therefore, the following relative diagnostic specificities were determined: 100% for Bovicheck BLV, Idexx Leukosis Serum X2, and Svanovir BLV; 95% for ID Screen BLV; and 97% for Serelisa BLV. When considering other test characteristics, ID Screen BLV is exceptional due to considerable practical advantages.","['Kuczewski, Alessa', 'Orsel, Karin', 'Barkema, Herman W', 'Kelton, David F', 'Hutchins, Wendy A', 'van der Meer, Frank J U M']","['Kuczewski A', 'Orsel K', 'Barkema HW', 'Kelton DF', 'Hutchins WA', 'van der Meer FJUM']","['Department of Ecosystem and Public Health, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada T2N 1N4.

In the context of acute leukaemia, it is important to have a diagnosis of the blasts lineage as soon as possible to decide the appropriate treatment. This is sometimes delayed due to difficulties in obtaining a bone marrow aspirate due to a ""dry tap"". In this study we evaluated retrospectively cell markers results by flow cytometry of unfixed bone marrow trephines of 65 patients with leukaemia at diagnosis and including a few after treatment. Our aims were: 1) To compare cell markers results between bone marrow trephine (BMT) and bone marrow aspirate (BMA) 24 cases and BMT with peripheral blood (PB) 14 cases in paired samples to establish if they were reproducible with results of the unfixed bone marrow trephine biopsies. 2) To ascertain a precise diagnosis in 27 (42%) of the cases in which only a bone marrow trephine was available. We demonstrated that unfixed bone marrow trephine provides an adequate and representative cell suspension for flow cytometry and it is a powerful tool when no other material (bone marrow aspirate or peripheral blood) is available to make a rapid diagnosis. Furthermore when marrow aspirate or peripheral blood paired samples were available, flow cytometry results obtained were identical across all the sample types. Applicability to the clinical laboratory: We described a method to obtain a cell suspension from core biopsies that can easily be implemented routinely in a laboratory that performs diagnostic flow cytometry immunophenotyping. This method is simple, inexpensive and it doesn't require extra equipment.","['Morilla, R', 'Moss, K', 'Nikolova, V', 'Marquardt, K', 'Duke, S', 'Adamowska, K', 'Fuller, L', 'Taifoor, A', 'Johnson, N', 'Zeisig, A', 'Morilla, A', 'Atra, A', 'Taussig, D C']","['Morilla R', 'Moss K', 'Nikolova V', 'Marquardt K', 'Duke S', 'Adamowska K', 'Fuller L', 'Taifoor A', 'Johnson N', 'Zeisig A', 'Morilla A', 'Atra A', 'Taussig DC']","['Royal Marsden Hospital, Haemato-Oncology Section, United Kingdom.

However, the application of As2O3 is largely limited by its drug resistance in the treatment of non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). Therefore, it is an urgent task to enhance the sensitivity of lung cancer cells to As2O3. In this study, using human lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells as a cell culture model, we demonstrated that an adenosine triphosphate binding cassette (ABC) transporter, ABCG2, was significantly increased by As2O3 treatment, while other ABC transporters, ABCB1 and ABCC1 showed no remarkable change in the response to As2O3. After inhibition of ABCG2 by its specific inhibitor, the drug sensitivity of As2O3 to A549 cells was significantly enhanced, manifested by decreased cell viability and colony formation as well as the increased ROS production and cell apoptosis. To further understand the molecular mechanism underlying the elevation of ABCG2 expression in As2O3-treated cells, we detected the activation state of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) pathway and its relationship with ABCG2 expression. Our results revealed that the increased expression of ABCG2 was regulated by NF-kappaB, and thus affecting the cell death of As2O3-treated A549 cells. These findings indicate that inhibition of NF-kappaB/ABCG2 pathway by specific inhibitors may be a new strategy for the improvement of As2O3 sensitivity in NSCLC treatment.","['Jiang, Xuejun', 'Chen, Chengzhi', 'Gu, Shiyan', 'Zhang, Zunzhen']","['Jiang X', 'Chen C', 'Gu S', 'Zhang Z']","[""Department of Occupational and Environmental Health, West China School of Public Health, Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan, People's Republic of China; Center of Experimental Teaching for Public Health, Experimental Teaching and Management Center, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Occupational and Environmental Health, West China School of Public Health, Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan, People's Republic of China; Department of Occupational and Environmental Health, School of Public Health and Management, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Occupational and Environmental Health, West China School of Public Health, Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Occupational and Environmental Health, West China School of Public Health, Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan, People's Republic of China.

Donors were related (n = 43) or unrelated (n = 57). When a planned interim analysis showed superior progression-free survival in the TBI arm (P = .04), all subsequent patients received TBI. With a follow-up of 12 to 40 months (median, 20), the 1-year overall survival was 80% for the TBI arm and 69% for the non-TBI arm. The 1-year cumulative incidence of relapse was 22% and 34%, respectively (P = .06). Among patients with low-risk disease the 1-year relapse incidence was 15% and 31% (P = .20) and for patients with high-risk disease, 26% and 36% (P = .18), respectively. Among MDS patients the 1-year relapse incidence was 27% versus 33% (P = .49) and among AML patients 16% versus 35% (P = .05), respectively. The largest difference was among patients with unfavorable cytogenetics, with 1-year relapse incidences of 31% and 63% (P = .18), respectively. Nonrelapse mortality in this high-risk patient population was 9% at 6 months and did not differ between arms. Thus, treosulfan/fludarabine/low-dose TBI provided effective conditioning for allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation in high-risk patients up to 70 years of age. The addition of TBI had a more profound effect in patients with AML than in those with MDS. High-risk disease features were associated with a lower overall success rate. Further studies are warranted.","['Deeg, H Joachim', 'Stevens, Emily A', 'Salit, Rachel B', 'Ermoian, Ralph P', 'Fang, Min', 'Gyurkocza, Boglarka', 'Sorror, Mohamed L', 'Fatobene, Giancarlo', 'Baumgart, Joachim', 'Burroughs, Lauri M', 'Delaney, Colleen', 'Doney, Kris', 'Egan, Daniel N', 'Flowers, Mary E D', 'Milano, Filippo', 'Radich, Jerry P', 'Scott, Bart L', 'Sickle, Eileen J', 'Wood, Brent L', 'Yeung, Cecilia', 'Storer, Barry E']","['Deeg HJ', 'Stevens EA', 'Salit RB', 'Ermoian RP', 'Fang M', 'Gyurkocza B', 'Sorror ML', 'Fatobene G', 'Baumgart J', 'Burroughs LM', 'Delaney C', 'Doney K', 'Egan DN', 'Flowers MED', 'Milano F', 'Radich JP', 'Scott BL', 'Sickle EJ', 'Wood BL', 'Yeung C', 'Storer BE']","['Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington; University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, Washington.

However, whether PPARgamma is expressed in Jurkat cells, a human T-lymphocyte leukaemia cell line, and whether activation of PPARgamma affects cell biological behaviors remains to be clarified. In this study, we investigated the effect of a PPARgamma activator rosiglitazone, under clinically relevant pharmacological concentrations, on the growth and apoptosis of Jurkat cells in vitro and explored the possible mechanism. Metformin was also included as a positive control for the anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects. We found that PPARgamma mRNA was transcribed in Jurkat cells. Treatment with rosiglitazone (5 microM, 10 microM, and 20 microM) or metformin (1 mM and 10 mM) inhibited cell proliferation, and induced cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 or S phase, respectively, in a dose-dependent manner. Although metformin significantly upregulated the protein levels of the pro-apoptotic markers cleaved-caspase 3 and Bax in Jurkat cells, rosiglitazone did not have such an effect. Moreover, rosiglitazone significantly upregulated the level of PPARgamma, and downregulated the expression of insulin receptor (IR) and insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R) in a dose-dependent manner. Our data indicate that rosiglitazone has an anti-proliferative effect in Jurkat cells, which may be at least partly mediated via downregulating IR and IGF-1R expression. Therefore, rosiglitazone may have a potential role not only for management of hyperglycaemia but also for control of tumor progression in patients with T-lymphocyte leukaemia and diabetes.","['Wei, Rui', 'Yu, Fei', 'Yang, Jin', 'Gao, Hongwei', 'Wang, Haining', 'Hong, Tianpei']","['Wei R', 'Yu F', 'Yang J', 'Gao H', 'Wang H', 'Hong T']","['Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Peking University Third Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Peking University Third Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Peking University Third Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Peking University Third Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Peking University Third Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Peking University Third Hospital, Beijing, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20180118,England,Cell Biol Int,Cell biology international,9307129,,['NOTNLM'],"['Jurkat cells', 'PPARgamma', 'cell cycle arrest', 'metformin', 'proliferation', 'rosiglitazone']",2017/12/24 06:00,2018/09/11 06:00,['2017/12/24 06:00'],"['2017/09/08 00:00 [received]', '2017/12/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/12/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/09/11 06:00 [medline]', '2017/12/24 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cbin.10925 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Biol Int. 2018 May;42(5):515-524. doi: 10.1002/cbin.10925.

NPM1 is one of the most common recurrently mutated genes in AML. NPM1 mutations often co-occur with FLT3-ITDs and mutations in genes regulating DNA methylation, such as DNMT3A, TET2, and IDH1/2. It remains unclear whether these genetic alterations are associated with distinct immunophenotypic findings or affect prognosis. We identified 133 cases of NPM1-mutated AML and correlated sequencing data with immunophenotypic and clinical findings. Of 84 cases (63%) that lacked monocytic differentiation (""myeloid AML""), 40 (48%) demonstrated an acute promyelocytic leukemia-like (APL-like) immunophenotype by flow cytometry, with absence of CD34 and HLA-DR and strong myeloperoxidase expression, in the absence of a PML-RARA translocation. Pathologic variants in TET2, IDH1, or IDH2 were identified in 39/40 APL-like cases. This subset of NPM1-mutated AML was associated with longer relapse-free and overall survival, when compared with cases that were positive for CD34 and/or HLA-DR. The combination of NPM1 and TET2 or IDH1/2 mutations along with an APL-like immunophenotype identifies a distinct subtype of AML. Further studies addressing its biology and clinical significance may be especially relevant in the era of IDH inhibitors and recent work showing efficacy of ATRA therapy in NPM1 and IDH1-mutated AML.","['Mason, Emily F', 'Kuo, Frank C', 'Hasserjian, Robert P', 'Seegmiller, Adam C', 'Pozdnyakova, Olga']","['Mason EF', 'Kuo FC', 'Hasserjian RP', 'Seegmiller AC', 'Pozdnyakova O']","['Department of Pathology, Microbiology, and Immunology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee.', ""Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts."", 'Department of Pathology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Department of Pathology, Microbiology, and Immunology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee.', ""Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20180125,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,,,,2017/12/24 06:00,2019/05/06 06:00,['2017/12/24 06:00'],"['2017/12/16 00:00 [received]', '2017/12/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/12/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/06 06:00 [medline]', '2017/12/24 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.25018 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2018 Aug;93(4):504-510. doi: 10.1002/ajh.25018.

However, the monetary costs of treatment regimens are not measured. AALL0232 was a COG randomized phase III trial for children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia that found that dexamethasone (DEX) was a more effective glucocorticoid than prednisone (PRED) in patients younger than 10 years, but PRED was equally effective and less toxic in older patients. In addition, high-dose methotrexate (HD-MTX) led to better survival than escalating doses of methotrexate (C-MTX). Cost data from the Pediatric Health Information System database were merged with clinical data from the COG AALL0232 trial. Total and component costs were compared between treatment arms and across hospitals. Inpatient costs were higher in the HD-MTX and DEX arms when compared to the C-MTX and PRED arms at the end of therapy. There was no difference in cost between these arms at last follow-up. Considerable variation in total costs existed across centers to deliver the same therapy that was driven by differences in inpatient days and pharmacy costs. The more effective regimens were found to be more expensive during therapy but were ultimately cost-neutral in longer term follow-up. The variations in cost across centers suggest an opportunity to standardize resource utilization for patients receiving similar therapies, which could translate into reduced healthcare expenditures.","['DiNofia, Amanda M', 'Seif, Alix E', 'Devidas, Meenakshi', 'Li, Yimei', 'Hall, Matthew', 'Huang, Yuan-Shung V', 'Cahen, Viviane', 'Hunger, Stephen P', 'Winick, Naomi J', 'Carroll, William L', 'Fisher, Brian T', 'Larsen, Eric C', 'Aplenc, Richard']","['DiNofia AM', 'Seif AE', 'Devidas M', 'Li Y', 'Hall M', 'Huang YV', 'Cahen V', 'Hunger SP', 'Winick NJ', 'Carroll WL', 'Fisher BT', 'Larsen EC', 'Aplenc R']","[""Division of Oncology, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."", 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', ""Division of Oncology, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."", 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'Division of Biostatistics, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida.', ""Division of Oncology, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."", 'The Center for Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', ""Children's Hospital Association, Lenexa, Kansas."", ""Center for Pediatric Clinical Effectiveness, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."", ""Division of Oncology, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."", ""Division of Oncology, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."", 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Center for Cancer and Blood Disorders, University of Texas at Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas.', 'Perlmutter Cancer Center Departments of Pediatrics and Pathology, NYU Langone Medical Center, New York, New York.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'The Center for Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', ""Center for Pediatric Clinical Effectiveness, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."", ""Division of Infectious Diseases, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."", 'Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Maine Medical Center, Scarborough, Maine.', ""Division of Oncology, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."", 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'The Center for Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', ""Center for Pediatric Clinical Effectiveness, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.""]",['eng'],"['T32 CA009679/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016520/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180899/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180886/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 HD064567/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States']","['Clinical Trial, Phase III', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20171223,United States,Cancer Med,Cancer medicine,101595310,PMC5773964,['NOTNLM'],"['*Child', '*clinical trial', '*costs', '*leukemia', '*variation']",2017/12/24 06:00,2019/06/25 06:00,['2017/12/24 06:00'],"['2017/05/01 00:00 [received]', '2017/08/26 00:00 [revised]', '2017/08/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/12/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/25 06:00 [medline]', '2017/12/24 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cam4.1206 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Med. 2018 Jan;7(1):3-12. doi: 10.1002/cam4.1206.

This refers to a CDI incidence density of 2.0/1000 inpatient days. According to the hospital hygiene standard, symptomatic patients with CDI were kept in contact isolation. Most patients (median age 8.2 years) suffered from acute lymphoblastic leukemia; 88.9% were treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics during the preceding 4 weeks. 29.6% received intravenous morphine/metamizole and parenteral nutrition due to severe chemotherapy-induced mucositis. None of the patients experienced severe complications such as lower gastrointestinal tract bleeding, sepsis, or toxic megacolon. Genotyping of the isolates derived from symptomatic patients revealed many different ribotypes without detection of the hypervirulent 027 strain and did not point at hospital transmission as an important promoter of CDI in our unit. CONCLUSION: Under strict standard hygiene and contact isolation for symptomatic patients, genotyping of clinical isolates revealed that in pediatric cancer patients, CDI is not necessarily based on nosocomial transmission. The rate of CDI-related severe complications was low. What is Known: * Pediatric cancer patients face an increased risk of Clostridium difficile-associated disease due to immunosuppression, cancer chemotherapy, mucositis, and dysbiosis following intravenous broad-spectrum antimicrobial treatment. * C. difficile may be transmitted from patient to patient. What is New: * Under strict standard hygiene and contact isolation for symptomatic patients, genotyping of clinical isolates revealed that in pediatric cancer patients, CDI is not necessarily based on nosocomial transmission. * The rate of CDI-related severe complications was low.","['Simon, Arne', 'Mock, Markus', 'Graf, Norbert', 'von Muller, Lutz']","['Simon A', 'Mock M', 'Graf N', 'von Muller L']","['Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, Saarland University Hospital, Saar, Homburg, Germany.

Both aberrant cyclin D1 expression and underlying chromosomal aberration may be used as molecular targets for monitoring minimal residual disease (MRD). The present study aims to assess the usefulness of quantitative cyclin D1 gene expression compared to the standardised but more technologically demanding DNA-based method for immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGH) or t(11;14) clone-specific gene rearrangement quantification in a cohort of bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood (PB) samples from patients with MCL. We simultaneously evaluated DNA-MRD and cyclin D1 expression levels in 234 samples from 57 patients. We observed that both in DNA-MRD positive and negative BM/PB pairs from the same time points the expression levels of cyclin D1 are lower in PB than in BM (median 19x, BM/PB range 0.41-352). The correlation of cyclin D1 transcript levels with DNA-MRD or with flow cytometry was good only in samples with a very high infiltration. In DNA-MRD-negative BM samples, we observed a significant heterogeneity of cyclin D1 expression (in the range of more than three orders of magnitude). This is in contrast to previous reports demonstrating the usefulness of cyclin D1 for MRD monitoring that did not use DNA-based method as a reference. In PB, the specificity of cyclin D1 expression was better due to a lower physiological background. In conclusion, we show that cyclin D1 is unsuitable for MRD monitoring in BM.","['Lokvenc, M', 'Kalinova, Marketa', 'Forsterova, K', 'Klener, P', 'Trneny, M', 'Fronkova, E', 'Kodet, R']","['Lokvenc M', 'Kalinova M', 'Forsterova K', 'Klener P', 'Trneny M', 'Fronkova E', 'Kodet R']","['Department of Pathology and Molecular Medicine, University Hospital Motol, 2nd Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Pathology and Molecular Medicine, University Hospital Motol, 2nd Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic. marketa.kalinova@lfmotol.cuni.cz.', 'First Department of Medicine - Department of Haematology, Charles University General Hospital and First Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'First Department of Medicine - Department of Haematology, Charles University General Hospital and First Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'First Department of Medicine - Department of Haematology, Charles University General Hospital and First Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'CLIP - Childhood Leukaemia Investigation Prague, Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, 2nd Faculty of Medicine, Charles University and University Hospital Motol, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Pathology and Molecular Medicine, University Hospital Motol, 2nd Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],"['CZ.2.16/3.1.00/24022/EU-Prague, OPPK', 'CZ.2.16/3.1.00/2505/EU-Prague, OPPK', 'GAUK no. 20214/Grantova Agentura, Univerzita Karlova', '00064203/Ministerstvo Zdravotnictvi Ceske Republiky', 'PRVOUK P24/LF1/3/Ministerstvo Skolstvi, Mladeze a Telovychovy (CZ)', 'PRVOUK-27/LF1/1/Ministerstvo Skolstvi, Mladeze a Telovychovy', 'NPU I nr.LO1604/Ministerstvo Skolstvi, Mladeze a Telovychovy', '16-32568A/AZV', 'GBP302/12/G101/Grantova Agentura Ceske Republiky']",['Journal Article'],20171222,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,,['NOTNLM'],"['Cyclin D1', 'Mantle cell lymphoma', 'Minimal residual disease', 'Real-time PCR']",2017/12/24 06:00,2018/02/16 06:00,['2017/12/24 06:00'],"['2017/06/28 00:00 [received]', '2017/12/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/12/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/16 06:00 [medline]', '2017/12/24 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00277-017-3210-8 [doi]', '10.1007/s00277-017-3210-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2018 Mar;97(3):467-474. doi: 10.1007/s00277-017-3210-8.

In this study, we analyzed the clinical, cytogenetic, and molecular features of five new patients with the t(12;22)/MN1-EVT6 who presented with acute myeloid leukemia or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. We subsequently reviewed the literature and identified seven additional cases reported with t(12;22)/MN1-EVT6. Our data suggest that neoplasms carrying the t(12;22)/MN1-ETV6, although rare, can commonly present as myeloid neoplasms at the initial diagnosis, including acute myeloid leukemia (n = 8), myelodysplastic syndrome (n = 2), and myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms (n = 2). There were five men and seven women with a median age of 43 years (range, 15-63 years) at initial diagnosis. Cytogenetics revealed t(12;22) as the sole abnormality in five patients, with the remaining seven patients harboring additional chromosomal aberrations. Of the five patients who received known therapy regimens, all of them had poor response to the idarubicin/mitoxantrone + cytarabine regimen. Of the seven patients with follow-up information, six patients died with a median overall survival time of only 5 months (range, 1-12 months) after the emergence of t(12;22). In summary, patients with t(12;22) are frequently associated with myeloid neoplasms, poor response to chemotherapy, and inferior outcome.","['Shao, Haigang', 'Cen, Jiannong', 'Chen, Suning', 'Qiu, Huiying', 'Pan, Jinlan']","['Shao H', 'Cen J', 'Chen S', 'Qiu H', 'Pan J']","[""Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Hemostasis of Ministry of Health, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, 188 Shizi Street, Suzhou, 215006, People's Republic of China."", ""Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Hemostasis of Ministry of Health, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, 188 Shizi Street, Suzhou, 215006, People's Republic of China."", ""Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Hemostasis of Ministry of Health, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, 188 Shizi Street, Suzhou, 215006, People's Republic of China."", ""Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Hemostasis of Ministry of Health, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, 188 Shizi Street, Suzhou, 215006, People's Republic of China."", ""Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Hemostasis of Ministry of Health, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, 188 Shizi Street, Suzhou, 215006, People's Republic of China. jinlanpan@126.com.""]",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",20171222,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,,['NOTNLM'],"['MN1-EVT6 fusion gene', 'Myeloid neoplasm', 't(12;22)']",2017/12/24 06:00,2018/02/16 06:00,['2017/12/24 06:00'],"['2017/11/22 00:00 [received]', '2017/12/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/12/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/16 06:00 [medline]', '2017/12/24 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00277-017-3208-2 [doi]', '10.1007/s00277-017-3208-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2018 Mar;97(3):417-424. doi: 10.1007/s00277-017-3208-2.

The average annual population of Lahore was 9.8 million in 2010-2012. This is a sequel to a study published earlier. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study. SETTING: The registry has 19 centres in Lahore reporting their data to the coordinating office located within the Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital and Research Center (SKMCH&RC), Lahore, Pakistan. PARTICIPANTS: Data existing in the PCR database, based on a confirmed diagnosis of cancer from 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2012, among the Lahore residents, were reviewed. OUTCOME MEASURES: Cancer counts and the age-standardised incidence rates (ASIR) per 100 000 population were computed by gender, cancer site/type and age group (0-14, 15-19 and >/=20 years). RESULTS: Between 2010 and 2012, of the 15 840 new cancers diagnosed, 57% were in females. The ASIRs in age groups 0-14, 15-19 and >/=20 years, among females, were: 6.1, 8.4 and 170.7, respectively, and among males, 9.3, 12.2 and 104.5, respectively. The common diagnoses in children, adolescents and adults were: (1) among females: leukaemia: 2.2; bone tumour: 1.4 and breast cancer: 79.2, respectively, and (2) among males: leukaemia: 3.6; bone tumour: 2.4 and prostate cancer: 10.7, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The ASIR was higher in adult women than in men, but it was lower in girls and young women than their corresponding male counterparts. Leukaemia was the most common diagnosis in children and bone tumour in adolescents, regardless of gender. Among women, breast cancer and, in men, prostate cancer, were the leading cancer types, in adults.

In this study, we showed that RTS could strongly induce apoptosis in K562 and K562/ADM cells. After the cells were treated by RTS, apoptotic population were increased compared to control and clearly distinguishable by DAPI nuclei staining. With increasing the dose of RTS, more cells arrested in S phase and G2/M phase. Secondly, we also showed that RTS could induce autophagy via up-regulation of LC3, p62/SQSTM1 and inhibition of mTOR in a much lower arsenic dosage in contrast to ATO and realgar. In addition, autophagy induced by RTS partially due to the degradation of fusion oncoprotein Bcr-Abl, which is associated with multidrug resistant in (MDR)-CML. Our results also showed that the apoptotic rate decreased when autophagic flux was attenuated by CQ via inhibiting cleaved-caspase-3 and alleviating Bcl-2 level. These suggested that RTS triggered autophagy is a pro-death process in CML and MDR-CML cells. In conclusion, our findings demonstrated that RTS could serve as a promising arsenic candidate for anti-CML/MDR-CML by inducing apoptosis and autophagy and is more potent than ATO and realgar.","['Wang, Xin', 'Chen, Baoqiang', 'Zhao, Longhe', 'Zhi, Dejuan', 'Hai, Yang', 'Song, Peng', 'Li, Yang', 'Xie, Qinjian', 'Inam, Ullah', 'Wu, Zhengrong', 'Yu, Lan', 'Li, Hongyu']","['Wang X', 'Chen B', 'Zhao L', 'Zhi D', 'Hai Y', 'Song P', 'Li Y', 'Xie Q', 'Inam U', 'Wu Z', 'Yu L', 'Li H']","['School of Pharmacy, Lanzhou University, 199 Donggang Rd., Lanzhou, Gansu, 730000, PR China.', 'School of Pharmacy, Lanzhou University, 199 Donggang Rd., Lanzhou, Gansu, 730000, PR China.', 'School of Pharmacy, Lanzhou University, 199 Donggang Rd., Lanzhou, Gansu, 730000, PR China.', 'School of Pharmacy, Lanzhou University, 199 Donggang Rd., Lanzhou, Gansu, 730000, PR China.', 'School of Pharmacy, Lanzhou University, 199 Donggang Rd., Lanzhou, Gansu, 730000, PR China.', 'School of Life Sciences, Lanzhou University, 222 Tianshui Rd., Lanzhou, Gansu, 730000, PR China.', 'School of Pharmacy, Lanzhou University, 199 Donggang Rd., Lanzhou, Gansu, 730000, PR China.', 'Gansu Corps Hospital of CAPF, 251 Gong Jia Wan Jianlan Xin Cun, Lanzhou, Gansu, 730000, PR China.', 'School of Pharmacy, Lanzhou University, 199 Donggang Rd., Lanzhou, Gansu, 730000, PR China.', 'School of Pharmacy, Lanzhou University, 199 Donggang Rd., Lanzhou, Gansu, 730000, PR China.', 'School of Pharmacy, Lanzhou University, 199 Donggang Rd., Lanzhou, Gansu, 730000, PR China.', 'School of Pharmacy, Lanzhou University, 199 Donggang Rd., Lanzhou, Gansu, 730000, PR China; School of Life Sciences, Lanzhou University, 222 Tianshui Rd., Lanzhou, Gansu, 730000, PR China.

Recent advances have identified isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutations in up to 80% lower grade gliomas (LGG) and in 76% secondary glioblastomas (GBM). IDH mutations are also seen in 10%-20% of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In AML, it was determined that mutations of IDH and other genes involving epigenetic regulations are early events, emerging in the pre-leukemic stem cells (pre-LSCs) stage, whereas mutations in genes propagating oncogenic signal are late events in leukemia. IDH mutations are also early events in glioma, occurring before TP53 mutation, 1p/19q deletion, etc. Despite these advances in glioma research, studies into other molecular alterations have lagged considerably. In this study, we analyzed currently available databases. We identified EZH2, KMT2C, and CHD4 as important genes in glioma in addition to the known gene IDH1/2. We also showed that genomic alterations of PIK3CA, CDKN2A, CDK4, FIP1L1, or FUBP1 collaborate with IDH mutations to negatively affect patients' survival in LGG. In LGG patients with TP53 mutations or IDH1/2 mutations, additional genomic alterations of EZH2, KMC2C, and CHD4 individually or in combination were associated with a markedly decreased disease-free survival than patients without such alterations. Alterations of EZH2, KMT2C, and CHD4 at genetic level or protein level could perturb epigenetic program, leading to malignant transformation in glioma. By reviewing current literature on both AML and glioma and performing bioinformatics analysis on available datasets, we developed a hypothetical model on the tumorigenesis from premalignant stem cells to glioma.","['Zhang, Le', 'Liu, Ying', 'Wang, Mengning', 'Wu, Zhenhai', 'Li, Na', 'Zhang, Jinsong', 'Yang, Chuanwei']","['Zhang L', 'Liu Y', 'Wang M', 'Wu Z', 'Li N', 'Zhang J', 'Yang C']","['College of Computer Science, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.', 'College of Computer and Information Science, Southwest University, Chongqing, China.', 'The Vivian Smith Department of Neurosurgery, Center for Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine, The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Harvard Stem Cell Institute, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA.', ""Department of neurosurgery, ShouGuang People's Hospital, Shandong, China."", 'College of Computer and Information Science, Southwest University, Chongqing, China.', 'Pharmacological & Physiological Science, School of Medicine, Saint Louis University, St. Louis, MO, USA.', 'Breast Medical Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Systems Biology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 HL093195/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA178513/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Mol Cell Biol,Journal of molecular cell biology,101503669,PMC5907834,,,2017/12/23 06:00,2019/06/30 06:00,['2017/12/23 06:00'],"['2017/08/30 00:00 [received]', '2017/12/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/12/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/30 06:00 [medline]', '2017/12/23 06:00 [entrez]']","['4763639 [pii]', '10.1093/jmcb/mjx056 [doi]']",ppublish,J Mol Cell Biol. 2017 Dec 1;9(6):477-488. doi: 10.1093/jmcb/mjx056.,20190628,6,"['0 (CHD4 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 1.1.1.41 (Isocitrate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (EZH2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Mi-2 Nucleosome Remodeling and Deacetylase Complex)']",IM,"['Brain Neoplasms/*genetics/pathology', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein/genetics/*metabolism', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Glioma/*genetics/pathology', 'Humans', 'Isocitrate Dehydrogenase/*genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics', 'Mi-2 Nucleosome Remodeling and Deacetylase Complex/genetics/*metabolism', 'Models, Biological', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Neoplasm Grading', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics', 'Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Survival Analysis', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: In this multicenter study, respondents were children age eight to 18 years who had cancer or had received HSCT, and their parents. Two different child respondent populations were targeted. More symptomatic respondents were receiving active treatment for cancer, admitted to the hospital, and expected to be in the hospital three days later. Less symptomatic respondents were in maintenance therapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia or had completed cancer therapy. Children completed SSPedi and then responded to validated self-report measures of mucositis, nausea, pain, and global quality of life. Children in the more symptomatic group repeated SSPedi and a global symptom change scale three days later. Parent proxy-report was optional. Reliability was evaluated using intraclass correlations while convergent validity was evaluated using Spearman correlations. Results: Of 502 children enrolled, 302 were in the more symptomatic group and 200 were in the less symptomatic group. Intraclass correlation coefficients were 0.88 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.82 to 0.92) for test-retest reliability and 0.76 (95% CI = 0.71 to 0.80) for inter-rater reliability. The mean difference in SSPedi scores between more and less symptomatic groups was 7.8 (95% CI = 6.4 to 9.2). SSPedi was responsive to change in global symptoms. All hypothesized relationships among measures were observed. Conclusions: SSPedi is a self-report symptom bother tool for children with cancer and HSCT recipients that is reliable, valid, and responsive to change. SSPedi can be used for clinical and research purposes. Future work should focus on integration into care delivery.","['Dupuis, L Lee', 'Johnston, Donna L', 'Baggott, Christina', 'Hyslop, Shannon', 'Tomlinson, Deborah', 'Gibson, Paul', 'Orsey, Andrea', 'Dix, David', 'Price, Vicky', 'Vanan, Magimairajan', 'Portwine, Carol', 'Kuczynski, Susan', 'Spiegler, Brenda', 'Tomlinson, George A', 'Sung, Lillian']","['Dupuis LL', 'Johnston DL', 'Baggott C', 'Hyslop S', 'Tomlinson D', 'Gibson P', 'Orsey A', 'Dix D', 'Price V', 'Vanan M', 'Portwine C', 'Kuczynski S', 'Spiegler B', 'Tomlinson GA', 'Sung L']","['Program in Child Health Evaluative Sciences, The Hospital for Sick Children, Peter Gilgan Centre for Research and Learning, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Pharmacy, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', ""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada."", 'Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Stanford University Cancer Clinical Trials Office, Palo Alto, CA.', 'Program in Child Health Evaluative Sciences, The Hospital for Sick Children, Peter Gilgan Centre for Research and Learning, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Program in Child Health Evaluative Sciences, The Hospital for Sick Children, Peter Gilgan Centre for Research and Learning, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Haematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, London Health Sciences Centre, London, Ontario, Canada.', ""Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Connecticut Children's Medical Center, Hartford, CT."", ""Division of Hematology/Oncology/BMT, Department of Pediatrics, BC Children's Hospital, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada."", 'Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, IWK Health Centre, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada.', 'Pediatric Hematology/Oncology/BMT, CancerCare Manitoba, Research Institute in Oncology and Hematology, Departments of Pediatrics and Child Health and Biochemistry and Medical Genetics, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.', ""Division of Haematology/Oncology, McMaster Children's Hospital, Health Sciences Centre, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada."", 'Ontario Parents Advocating for Children with Cancer (OPACC), Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Psychology, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Medicine, Toronto General Hospital, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Program in Child Health Evaluative Sciences, The Hospital for Sick Children, Peter Gilgan Centre for Research and Learning, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Division of Haematology/Oncology, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Validation Study']",,United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,PMC6005103,,,2017/12/23 06:00,2019/07/30 06:00,['2017/12/23 06:00'],"['2017/07/13 00:00 [received]', '2017/10/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/12/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/30 06:00 [medline]', '2017/12/23 06:00 [entrez]']","['4768302 [pii]', '10.1093/jnci/djx250 [doi]']",ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 2018 Jun 1;110(6):661-668. doi: 10.1093/jnci/djx250.,20190729,6,,,"['Adolescent', 'Age of Onset', 'Child', '*Diagnostic Self Evaluation', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/psychology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mass Screening/methods/standards', 'Neoplasms/epidemiology/psychology/*therapy', '*Pediatrics/methods/standards', 'Psychometrics', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Self Report/*standards', '*Symptom Assessment/methods/standards', 'Transplant Recipients/psychology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to identify the potential mediators involved in ceramide accumulation and the cell death response, differentially expressed genes were identified by Affymetrix Microarray Analysis. Molt-4-LXSN cells, expressing wild type p53, and p53-deficient Molt-4-E6 cells were irradiated and harvested at 3 and 8 hours post-irradiation. Human genome U133 plus 2.0 array containing >47,000 transcripts was used for gene expression profiling. From over 10,000 probes, 281 and 12 probes were differentially expressed in Molt-4-LXSN and Molt-4-E6 cells, respectively. Data analysis revealed 63 (upregulated) and 20 (downregulated) genes (>2 fold) in Molt-4-LXSN at 3 hours and 140 (upregulated) and 21 (downregulated) at 8 hours post-irradiation. In Molt-4-E6 cells, 5 (upregulated) genes each were found at 3 hours and 8 hours, respectively. In Molt-4-LXSN cells, a significant fraction of the genes with altered expression at 3 hours were found to be involved in apoptosis signaling pathway (BCL2L11), p53 pathway (PMAIP1, CDKN1A and FAS) and oxidative stress response (FDXR, CROT and JUN). Similarly, at 8 hours the genes with altered expression were involved in the apoptosis signaling pathway (BAX, BIK and JUN), p53 pathway (BAX, CDKN1A and FAS), oxidative stress response (FDXR and CROT) and p53 pathway feedback loops 2 (MDM2 and CDKN1A). A global molecular and biological interaction map analysis showed an association of these altered genes with apoptosis, senescence, DNA damage, oxidative stress, cell cycle arrest and caspase activation. In a targeted study, activation of apoptosis correlated with changes in gene expression of some of the above genes and revealed sequential activation of both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways that precede ceramide accumulation and subsequent execution of apoptosis. One or more of these altered genes may be involved in p53-dependent ceramide accumulation.","['Hage-Sleiman, Rouba', 'Bahmad, Hisham', 'Kobeissy, Hadile', 'Dakdouk, Zeinab', 'Kobeissy, Firas', 'Dbaibo, Ghassan']","['Hage-Sleiman R', 'Bahmad H', 'Kobeissy H', 'Dakdouk Z', 'Kobeissy F', 'Dbaibo G']","['Department of Biology, Faculty of Sciences, Lebanese University, Hadath, Lebanon.', 'Department of Anatomy, Cell Biology and Physiological Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, Faculty of Medicine, American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, Faculty of Medicine, American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, Faculty of Medicine, American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, Faculty of Medicine, American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Center for Infectious Diseases Research, Faculty of Medicine, American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Validation Study']",20171222,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,PMC5741252,,,2017/12/23 06:00,2018/01/18 06:00,['2017/12/23 06:00'],"['2017/09/26 00:00 [received]', '2017/12/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/12/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/12/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/18 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0190221 [doi]', 'PONE-D-17-34833 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2017 Dec 22;12(12):e0190221. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0190221. eCollection 2017.,20180116,12,['0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)'],IM,"['Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Gamma Rays', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics/*pathology', 'Multigene Family', 'Systems Biology', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*physiology']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-2460-1348'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients with BRAF V600E-mutated melanoma respond to FDA-approved BRAF inhibitors. In addition, subsets of other BRAF V600E-mutated tumors may also benefit from BRAF inhibitor therapy. Currently, clinical laboratories typically use molecular-based methods for mutation analysis. However, recently a BRAF V600E mutation-specific antibody has become available as a cost-effective alternative method to DNA-based molecular testing. We analyzed multiple tumor types including melanoma, colorectal carcinoma, papillary thyroid cancer, hairy cell leukemia, and Langerhans cell histiocytosis using both DNA-based sequencing and the BRAF V600E mutation-specific antibody. Our results show a high degree of concordance between the 2 methods.

However, evidence of impairment in survivors of other pediatric malignancies and possible risk factors is limited. PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: HRPF of 17 survivors of pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML), 26 survivors of neuroblastoma (NBL), 28 survivors of Wilms tumor (WT) (median age 28.8 [18.8-62.6] years) after a median follow-up time of 24.5 (6.5-43.6) years, and 74 healthy controls (median age 26.9 [17.9-61.7] years). Risk factors were investigated. Testing included submaximal cardiovascular endurance (6-Minute Walk Test (6 MWT), flexibility, and muscle strength. RESULTS: Results are expressed as mean (standard error). Survivors scored significantly lower than controls on the 6 MWT (588 +/- 6.1 m vs. controls 611 +/- 6.0 m; P = 0.008), on side flexion of the trunk (20.1 +/- 0.4 cm vs. controls 22.4 +/-0.4 cm; P < 0.001), and on vertical jump (39.7 +/- 0.8 cm vs. controls 43.8 +/- 0.8 cm; P < 0.001). Survivors of AML had lower scores on the 6 MWT (563 +/- 12.4 m) than survivors of NBL (585 +/- 9.9 m) and survivors of WT (606 +/- 9.6 m), P = 0.046. Being a survivor, higher body mass index (BMI) and no participation in sports were independently associated with lower scores on the 6 MWT. CONCLUSION: Survivors of NBL, WT, and especially AML have impaired HRPF. Higher BMI and physical inactivity at adult age appeared prominent risk factors for impaired HRPF in these survivors.","['Hartman, Annelies', 'Pluijm, Saskia M F', 'Wijnen, Mark', 'Neggers, Sebastian J C M M', 'Clemens, Eva', 'Pieters, Rob', 'van den Heuvel-Eibrink, Marry M']","['Hartman A', 'Pluijm SMF', 'Wijnen M', 'Neggers SJCMM', 'Clemens E', 'Pieters R', 'van den Heuvel-Eibrink MM']","[""Department of Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, Erasmus MC Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."", ""Department of Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, Erasmus MC Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."", 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', ""Department of Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, Erasmus MC Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."", 'Section of Endocrinology, Department of Internal Medicine, Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', ""Department of Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, Erasmus MC Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."", 'Section of Endocrinology, Department of Internal Medicine, Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', ""Department of Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, Erasmus MC Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."", 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', ""Department of Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, Erasmus MC Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."", 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20171222,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,['NOTNLM'],"['*childhood cancer', '*health-related fitness', '*obesity', '*physical activity', '*survivor']",2017/12/23 06:00,2019/04/25 06:00,['2017/12/23 06:00'],"['2017/05/05 00:00 [received]', '2017/10/31 00:00 [revised]', '2017/10/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/12/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/25 06:00 [medline]', '2017/12/23 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.26907 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2018 Apr;65(4). doi: 10.1002/pbc.26907.

The aim of this study was to investigate the vascular and structural changes in the retina of diabetic mice and to explore whether LIF prevents experimental diabetes-induced retinal injury in the early stages. METHODS: Diabetes was induced in C57Bl/6J mice with streptozotocin (STZ) injections. Successful diabetic animal models were randomly separated into two groups: the diabetic group (n = 15) and the LIF-treated group (n = 15). Normal C57BL/6 mice served as the normal control group (n = 14). Recombinant human LIF was intravitreally injected 8 weeks after the diabetic model was successfully established. Retinas were collected and evaluated using histological and immunohistochemical techniques, and flat-mounted retinas and Western blotting were performed at 18 weeks after the induction of diabetes and 2 days after the intravitreal injection of LIF. The analysis of variance test were used. RESULTS: Histological analysis showed that there were fewer retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and the inner nuclear layer (INL) became thinner in the diabetic model group (RGC 21.8 +/- 4.0 and INL 120.2 +/- 4.6 mum) compared with the normal control group (RGC 29.0 +/- 6.7, t = -3.02, P = 0.007; INL 150.7 +/- 10.6 mum, t = -8.88, P < 0.001, respectively). After LIF treatment, the number of RGCs (26.9 +/- 5.3) was significantly increased (t = 3.39, P = 0.030) and the INL (134.5 +/- 14.2 mum) was thicker compared to the diabetic group (t = 2.75, P = 0.013). In the anti-Brn-3a-labeled retinas, the number of RGCs in the LIF-treated group (3926.0 +/- 143.9) was obviously increased compared to the diabetic group (3507.7 +/- 286.1, t = 2.38, P = 0.030), while no significance was found between the LIF-treated group and the control group (4188.3 +/- 114.7, t = -2.47, P = 0.069). Flat-mounted retinas demonstrated that a disorganized, dense distribution of the vessel was prominent in the diabetic model group. Vessel distribution in the LIF-treated mouse group was typical and the thickness was uniform. The levels of phosphosignal transducer and activator of transcription 3 activation were obviously higher in the LIF-injected retinas than those in the diabetic control group (t = 3.85, P = 0.019) and the normal control (t = -3.20, P = 0.019). CONCLUSION: The present study provides evidence that LIF treatment protects the integrity of the vasculature and prevents retinal injury in the early stages of diabetic retinopathy in STZ-induced diabetic models.","['Yang, Xiu-Fen', 'Huang, Ying-Xiang', 'Lan, Ming', 'Zhang, Tao-Ran', 'Zhou, Jie']","['Yang XF', 'Huang YX', 'Lan M', 'Zhang TR', 'Zhou J']","['Department of Ophthalmology, The Friendship Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing 100050, China.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, The Friendship Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing 100050, China.', ""Institute of Laboratory Animals of Sichuan Academy of Medical Sciences & Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital, Chengdu, Sichuan 610072, China."", 'Department of Ophthalmology, The Friendship Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing 100050, China.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, The Friendship Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing 100050, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,China,Chin Med J (Engl),Chinese medical journal,7513795,PMC5754962,,,2017/12/23 06:00,2019/05/01 06:00,['2017/12/23 06:00'],"['2017/12/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/12/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/01 06:00 [medline]']","['ChinMedJ_2018_131_1_75_221263 [pii]', '10.4103/0366-6999.221263 [doi]']",ppublish,Chin Med J (Engl). 2018 Jan 5;131(1):75-81. doi: 10.4103/0366-6999.221263.,20190430,1,"['0 (Blood Glucose)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '5W494URQ81 (Streptozocin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blood Glucose', 'Cell Count', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental/chemically induced/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Diabetic Retinopathy/chemically induced/pathology/*prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Intravitreal Injections', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Recombinant Proteins/therapeutic use', 'Retina/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Retinal Ganglion Cells/drug effects/pathology', 'Retinal Vessels/*drug effects/pathology', '*Streptozocin']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Monoclonal B lymphocytosis (MBL) is a precursor state of CLL and is currently under recognized. Since MBL is seen as a benign disorder that rarely evolves into CLL, screening for MBL is not standardized and does not require any treatment. When reviewing renal disease associated with MBL, there is very scant data in the literature and to date there is no case describing the association between MBL and MCD. Here, we describe the case of a 71-year old woman admitted for nephrotic syndrome (NS). We diagnosed a MBL. Kidney biopsy revealed MCD. Treatment with corticosteroids was introduced but no improvement was observed. Chemotherapy with rituximab and chlorambucil was thus started, leading to complete remission of both MBL and MCD. To our knowledge, this is the first description of the association of MBL and MCD. This case suggests that screening for MBL may have unexpected diagnostic and therapeutic implications in patients presenting with seemingly idiopathic NS.","['Wynsberghe, Margaux Van', 'Lenain, Pascal', 'Drieux, Fanny', 'Guerrot, Dominique', 'Bertrand, Dominique']","['Wynsberghe MV', 'Lenain P', 'Drieux F', 'Guerrot D', 'Bertrand D']","['Service de Nephrologie, Centre Hospitalier de Rouen, 76000, Rouen, France.', 'Service Hematologie, Centre Henri Becquerel, 76000, Rouen, France.', 'Service Anatomopathologie, Centre Hospitalier de Rouen, 76000, Rouen, France.', 'Service de Nephrologie, Centre Hospitalier de Rouen, 76000, Rouen, France.', 'Service de Nephrologie, Centre Hospitalier de Rouen, 76000, Rouen, France. dominique.bertrand@chu-rouen.fr.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20171221,Italy,J Nephrol,Journal of nephrology,9012268,,['NOTNLM'],"['*B lymphocytosis', '*Chrnic lynmphocytic leukemia', '*Hematology', '*Minimal change disease', '*Nephrotic syndrome']",2017/12/23 06:00,2019/08/14 06:00,['2017/12/23 06:00'],"['2017/08/30 00:00 [received]', '2017/12/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/12/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/14 06:00 [medline]', '2017/12/23 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s40620-017-0464-0 [doi]', '10.1007/s40620-017-0464-0 [pii]']",ppublish,J Nephrol. 2018 Apr;31(2):317-320. doi: 10.1007/s40620-017-0464-0.

However, we are increasingly becoming aware of several deleterious effects of cancer and the subsequent ""cure"" that extend beyond physical sequelae. Indeed, survivors of childhood cancer commonly report cognitive, emotional, and psychological difficulties, including attentional difficulties, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS). Cognitive late- and long-term effects have been largely attributed to neurotoxic effects of cancer treatments (e.g., chemotherapy, cranial irradiation, surgery) on brain development. The role of childhood adversity in pediatric cancer - namely, the presence of a life-threatening disease and endurance of invasive medical procedures - has been largely ignored in the existing neuroscientific literature, despite compelling research by our group and others showing that exposure to more commonly studied adverse childhood experiences (i.e., domestic and community violence, physical, sexual, and emotional abuse) strongly imprints on neural development. While these adverse childhood experiences are different in many ways from the experience of childhood cancer (e.g., context, nature, source), they do share a common element of exposure to threat (i.e., threat to life or physical integrity). Therefore, we argue that the double hit of early threat and cancer treatments likely alters neural development, and ultimately, cognitive, behavioral, and emotional outcomes. In this paper, we (1) review the existing neuroimaging research on child, adolescent, and adult survivors of childhood cancer, (2) summarize gaps in our current understanding, (3) propose a novel neurobiological framework that characterizes childhood cancer as a type of childhood adversity, particularly a form of early threat, focusing on development of the hippocampus and the salience and emotion network (SEN), and (4) outline future directions for research.","['Marusak, Hilary A', 'Iadipaolo, Allesandra S', 'Harper, Felicity W', 'Elrahal, Farrah', 'Taub, Jeffrey W', 'Goldberg, Elimelech', 'Rabinak, Christine A']","['Marusak HA', 'Iadipaolo AS', 'Harper FW', 'Elrahal F', 'Taub JW', 'Goldberg E', 'Rabinak CA']","['Department of Pharmacy Practice, Eugene Applebaum College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences, Wayne State University, 259 Mack Ave., Suite 2190, Detroit, MI, 48202, USA. hmarusak@med.wayne.edu.', 'Department of Pharmacy Practice, Eugene Applebaum College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences, Wayne State University, 259 Mack Ave., Suite 2190, Detroit, MI, 48202, USA.', 'Population Studies and Disparities Research Program, Karmanos Cancer Institute, Detroit, MI, USA.', 'Department of Oncology, School of Medicine, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacy Practice, Eugene Applebaum College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences, Wayne State University, 259 Mack Ave., Suite 2190, Detroit, MI, 48202, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, School of Medicine, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI, USA.', ""Children's Hospital of Michigan, Detroit, MI, USA."", 'Department of Pediatrics, School of Medicine, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI, USA.', 'Kids Kicking Cancer, Southfield, MI, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacy Practice, Eugene Applebaum College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences, Wayne State University, 259 Mack Ave., Suite 2190, Detroit, MI, 48202, USA.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Eugene Applebaum College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI, USA.', 'Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Neurosciences, School of Medicine, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI, USA.']",['eng'],"['14-238-04-IRG/American Cancer Society (US)/International', '129368-PF-16-057-01-PCSM/American Cancer Society (US)/International', 'K01 MH101123/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'K01MH101123/National Institute of Mental Health (US)/International', 'R61MH111935/National Institute of Mental Health (US)/International', 'R61 MH111935/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Review']",20171222,United States,Neuropsychol Rev,Neuropsychology review,9009029,PMC6639713,['NOTNLM'],"['*Childhood cancer', '*brain', '*brain tumor', '*leukemia', '*pediatric oncology']",2017/12/23 06:00,2019/01/23 06:00,['2017/12/23 06:00'],"['2017/05/03 00:00 [received]', '2017/11/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/12/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/23 06:00 [medline]', '2017/12/23 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s11065-017-9365-1 [doi]', '10.1007/s11065-017-9365-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Neuropsychol Rev. 2018 Jun;28(2):123-175. doi: 10.1007/s11065-017-9365-1.

The latter has been demonstrated to be promoted in vitro by mushroom polysaccharides via induction of apoptosis. However, the antileukemia activity of these compounds on primary cells is still not reported. In the present study, we examined the in vitro effects of Tramesan (TR), a bioactive compound extracted from Trametes versicolor, on leukemic cell lines and primary cells. Our results demonstrated that TR induced a marked growth inhibition of leukemic cell lines and primary cells from AML patients. The antiproliferative effects of TR were associated in primary AML cells with a significant increase of apoptosis. No significant cytotoxic effects were observed in normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells (MNC) from healthy donors. Our data demonstrated a cytotoxic activity of TR on leukemia cells prompting further translational applications.

Although cytogenetic abnormalities such as trisomy 8 or absence of chromosome Y are well known, few reports about cmml with trisomy 11 have been published. Here, we report a case of cmml with trisomy 11 as the sole chromosomal abnormality, resulting in a very poor outcome. Based on a bone marrow specimen, cmml-1 with trisomy 11 was diagnosed in a 79-year-old man presenting with anemia and atypical peripheral blood cells.

Two months after his diagnosis, the patient's leucocytosis and anemia rapidly worsened, with increasing numbers of immature peripheral cells, which was strongly suggestive of leukemic transformation. Because of acute kidney injury superimposed on chronic kidney disease that led to poor performance status, cytotoxic chemotherapy was not considered feasible, and the patient was transferred to a hospice care facility.","['Yoo, S H', 'Lim, J', 'Byun, J M', 'Park, J H', 'Kim, K H', 'Choi, I S']","['Yoo SH', 'Lim J', 'Byun JM', 'Park JH', 'Kim KH', 'Choi IS']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul Red Cross Hospital, and.', 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University Boramae Medical Center, Seoul, Korea.', 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University Boramae Medical Center, Seoul, Korea.', 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University Boramae Medical Center, Seoul, Korea.', 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University Boramae Medical Center, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20171220,Switzerland,Curr Oncol,"Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",9502503,PMC5736495,['NOTNLM'],"['Myelodysplastic syndrome', 'case reports', 'chronic myelomonocytic leukemia', 'trisomy 11']",2017/12/23 06:00,2017/12/23 06:01,['2017/12/23 06:00'],"['2017/12/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/12/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/23 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3747/co.24.3738 [doi]', 'conc-24-e547 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Oncol. 2017 Dec;24(6):e547-e550. doi: 10.3747/co.24.3738.

BCL-2 and functionally redundant counterpart, MCL-1, are frequently over-expressed in high-risk diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). While clinical inhibition of BCL-2 has been achieved with the BH3 mimetic venetoclax, anti-tumor efficacy is limited by compensatory induction of MCL-1. Voruciclib, an orally bioavailable clinical stage CDK-selective inhibitor, potently blocks CDK9, the transcriptional regulator of MCL-1. Here, we demonstrate that voruciclib represses MCL-1 protein expression in preclinical models of DLBCL. When combined with venetoclax in vivo, voruciclib leads to model-dependent tumor cell apoptosis and tumor growth inhibition. Strongest responses were observed in two models representing high-risk activated B-cell (ABC) DLBCL, while no response was observed in a third ABC model, and intermediate responses were observed in two models of germinal center B-cell like (GCB) DLBCL. Given the range of responses, we show that CIVO, a multiplexed tumor micro-dosing technology, represents a viable functional precision medicine approach for differentiating responders from non-responders to BCL-2/MCL-1 targeted therapy. These findings suggest that the combination of voruciclib and venetoclax holds promise as a novel, exclusively oral combination therapy for a subset of high-risk DLBCL patients.","['Dey, Joyoti', 'Deckwerth, Thomas L', 'Kerwin, William S', 'Casalini, Joseph R', 'Merrell, Angela J', 'Grenley, Marc O', 'Burns, Connor', 'Ditzler, Sally H', 'Dixon, Chantel P', 'Beirne, Emily', 'Gillespie, Kate C', 'Kleinman, Edward F', 'Klinghoffer, Richard A']","['Dey J', 'Deckwerth TL', 'Kerwin WS', 'Casalini JR', 'Merrell AJ', 'Grenley MO', 'Burns C', 'Ditzler SH', 'Dixon CP', 'Beirne E', 'Gillespie KC', 'Kleinman EF', 'Klinghoffer RA']","['Presage Biosciences, Inc, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Presage Biosciences, Inc, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Presage Biosciences, Inc, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Presage Biosciences, Inc, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Presage Biosciences, Inc, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Presage Biosciences, Inc, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Presage Biosciences, Inc, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Presage Biosciences, Inc, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Presage Biosciences, Inc, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Presage Biosciences, Inc, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Presage Biosciences, Inc, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Edward F.

The histone methyltransferase KMT2D, a frequently aberrant epigenetic modifier in various tumors, has an undefined role in PCa. Moreover, little is known regarding KMT2D's mutation in Chinese patients or its downstream signaling pathways and targets. Here, we profiled the mutational spectrum of 32 significantly PCa-associated genes by using disease-targeted sequencing, and found that KMT2D was highly mutated (63.04%, 29/46) in Chinese patients. Moreover, high KMT2D transcription was also associated with poor prognosis in an independent cohort (n = 51). In KMT2D-knockdown PC-3 and DU145 cells, cell proliferation (P < 0.01), invasion (P < 0.001), and migration (P < 0.01) were consequently suppressed. KMT2D depletion effectively suppressed tumor growth by 92.21% in vivo. Notably, integrative analyses of RNAseq and ChIPseq characterized two crucial genes downregulated by KMT2D, leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR) and Kruppel-like factor-4 (KLF4), which are regulators in PI3K/Akt and EMT, respectively. Our present study revealed that KMT2D epigenetically activates PI3K/Akt pathway and EMT by targeting LIFR and KLF4 and thus serves as a putative epigenetic-based target for treating PCa.","['Lv, Shidong', 'Ji, Liyan', 'Chen, Bin', 'Liu, Shuqiang', 'Lei, Chengyong', 'Liu, Xi', 'Qi, Xiaoxiao', 'Wang, Ying', 'Lai-Han Leung, Elaine', 'Wang, Hongyi', 'Zhang, Lin', 'Yu, Xiaoming', 'Liu, Zhongqiu', 'Wei, Qiang', 'Lu, Linlin']","['Lv S', 'Ji L', 'Chen B', 'Liu S', 'Lei C', 'Liu X', 'Qi X', 'Wang Y', 'Lai-Han Leung E', 'Wang H', 'Zhang L', 'Yu X', 'Liu Z', 'Wei Q', 'Lu L']","['Department of Urology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.', 'International Institute for Translational Chinese Medicine, Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.', 'International Institute for Translational Chinese Medicine, Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.', ""Department of Science and Training, General Hospital of Guangzhou Military Command of People's Liberation Army, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China."", 'International Institute for Translational Chinese Medicine, Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.', 'Department of Urology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.', 'International Institute for Translational Chinese Medicine, Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.', 'International Institute for Translational Chinese Medicine, Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.', 'International Institute for Translational Chinese Medicine, Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Quality Research in Chinese Medicine/Macau Institute For Applied Research in Medicine and Health, Macau University of Science and Technology, Macau (SAR), China.', 'Department of Urology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.', 'Department of Urology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.', 'Department of Urology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.', 'International Institute for Translational Chinese Medicine, Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China. liuzq@gzucm.edu.cn.', 'State Key Laboratory of Quality Research in Chinese Medicine/Macau Institute For Applied Research in Medicine and Health, Macau University of Science and Technology, Macau (SAR), China. liuzq@gzucm.edu.cn.', 'Department of Urology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China. qwei@smu.edu.cn.', 'International Institute for Translational Chinese Medicine, Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China. lllu@gzucm.edu.cn.', 'State Key Laboratory of Quality Research in Chinese Medicine/Macau Institute For Applied Research in Medicine and Health, Macau University of Science and Technology, Macau (SAR), China. lllu@gzucm.edu.cn.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20171222,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,PMC6168472,,,2017/12/23 06:00,2019/03/12 06:00,['2017/12/23 06:00'],"['2017/05/26 00:00 [received]', '2017/10/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/10/14 00:00 [revised]', '2017/12/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/12 06:00 [medline]', '2017/12/23 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41388-017-0026-x [doi]', '10.1038/s41388-017-0026-x [pii]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2018 Mar;37(10):1354-1368. doi: 10.1038/s41388-017-0026-x.

Here, the proband of a consanguineous family displayed moderate bilateral cataracts and elevated serum ferritin in the absence of iron overload. The parents and siblings showed variable degrees of mild bilateral cataracts combined with elevated levels of circulating ferritin. Sequencing of FTL identified a novel 5'UTR mutation c.-151A > G, also named ""Ghent +49A > G"". The zygosity of the mutation, occurring in homozygous and heterozygous state in the proband and other affected family members respectively, correlated well with severity of ophthalmological and hematological manifestations. The substitution is expected to impair the secondary structure of the upper IRE stem. Functional characterization of +49A > G by electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated a reduced binding affinity for IRP1 compared to the wild-type IRE of FTL.

However, the effect of obesity and overweight on the incidence of AML is not supported by all studies, and the relationship between obesity and prognosis of AML and APL has not been established. Thus, we conducted a meta-analysis to determine the role of BMI on the risk and clinical outcome of AML, including APL. Twenty-six eligible studies enrolling 12,971 AML (including 866 APL) patients were retrieved and analyzed. Overweight and obesity was associated with an increased incidence of AML (relative risk [RR], 1.23; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.12-1.35; P < 0.001). High BMI did not significantly affect overall survival (OS) (hazard ratio [HR], 0.97; 95% CI, 0.92-1.03; P = 0.323) or disease-free survival (HR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.88-1.10; P = 0.755) in patients with non-APL AML. By contrast, APL patients with high BMI had shorter OS (HR, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.26-2.48; P = 0.001) and a higher risk of differentiation syndrome (HR, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.03-2.27, P = 0.04).

Here, we tested whether this effect is generalizable to patients with acute leukemia.

We used qPCR for relative telomere length (RTL) measurement, and Cox proportional hazard models for statistical analyses. In a discovery cohort of 300 patients, longer donor RTL (>25th percentile) was associated with reduced risks of relapse (HR = 0.62, p = 0.05) and acute graft-versus-host disease II-IV (HR = 0.68, p = 0.05), and possibly with a higher probability of neutrophil engraftment (HR = 1.3, p = 0.06). However, these results did not replicate in two validation cohorts of 297 and 488 recipients. There was one exception; a higher probability of neutrophil engraftment was observed in one validation cohort (HR = 1.24, p = 0.05). In a combined analysis of the three cohorts, no statistically significant associations (all p > 0.1) were found between donor RTL and any outcomes.","['Gadalla, Shahinaz M', 'Wang, Tao', 'Loftus, David', 'Friedman, Lyssa', 'Dagnall, Casey', 'Haagenson, Michael', 'Spellman, Stephen R', 'Buturovic, Ljubomir', 'Blauwkamp, Marsha', 'Shelton, Jason', 'Fleischhauer, Katharina', 'Hsu, Katharine C', 'Verneris, Michael R', 'Krstajic, Damjan', 'Hicks, Belynda', 'Jones, Kristine', 'Lee, Stephanie J', 'Savage, Sharon A']","['Gadalla SM', 'Wang T', 'Loftus D', 'Friedman L', 'Dagnall C', 'Haagenson M', 'Spellman SR', 'Buturovic L', 'Blauwkamp M', 'Shelton J', 'Fleischhauer K', 'Hsu KC', 'Verneris MR', 'Krstajic D', 'Hicks B', 'Jones K', 'Lee SJ', 'Savage SA']","['Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD, USA. gadallas@mail.nih.gov.', 'Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI, USA.', 'Division of Biostatistics, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI, USA.', 'Telomere Diagnostics, Menlo Park, CA, USA.', 'Cancer Genomics Research Laboratory, Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Leidos Biomedical Research, Inc., Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research, Frederick, MD, USA.', 'Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research, Minneapolis, MN, USA.', 'Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research, Minneapolis, MN, USA.', 'Clinical Persona, Inc., East Palo Alto, CA, USA.', 'Telomere Diagnostics, Menlo Park, CA, USA.', 'Telomere Diagnostics, Menlo Park, CA, USA.', 'Institute for Experimental Cellular Therapy, University Hospital Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Pediatric BMT, University of Colorado, Aurora, CO, USA.', 'Clinical Persona, Inc., East Palo Alto, CA, USA.', 'Cancer Genomics Research Laboratory, Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Leidos Biomedical Research, Inc., Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research, Frederick, MD, USA.', 'Cancer Genomics Research Laboratory, Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Leidos Biomedical Research, Inc., Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research, Frederick, MD, USA.', 'Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research, Minneapolis, MN, USA.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD, USA.']",['eng'],"['U24 CA076518/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'ZIA CP010144-18/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States', 'ZIA CP010144-17/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA046934/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20171221,England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,PMC5898974,,,2017/12/23 06:00,2019/05/16 06:00,['2017/12/23 06:00'],"['2017/02/20 00:00 [received]', '2017/07/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/07/27 00:00 [revised]', '2017/12/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/16 06:00 [medline]', '2017/12/23 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41409-017-0029-9 [doi]', '10.1038/s41409-017-0029-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2018 Apr;53(4):383-391. doi: 10.1038/s41409-017-0029-9.

Of the 251 patients who were diagnosed with a T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma in our center between 1999 and 2014, at least 25 were identified in immunocompromised patients. Herein, we retrospectively analyzed the clinical and pathological characteristics of these 25 cases. In addition, we searched the literature and present an overview of 605 previously published cases. The actual number of patients with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia and patients on immunosuppressive drugs for inflammatory bowel disease or rheumatoid arthritis in the total cohort of 251 patients diagnosed with T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma was much higher than the number of patients expected to have these diseases in this cohort, based on their prevalence in the general population. This, together with the large number of additional cases found in the literature, suggest that the risk of developing T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma is increased in immunocompromised patients. Compared to T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma in the general population, these lymphomas are more often located extranodally, present at a younger age and appear to have a poor outcome. The observations made in the study herein should raise awareness of the possible development of T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma in immunodeficient patients, and challenge the prolonged use of immunosuppressive drugs in patients who are in clinical remission of their autoimmune disease.","['Nijland, Marieke L', 'Koens, Lianne', 'Pals, Steven T', 'Berge, Ineke J M Ten', 'Bemelman, Frederike J', 'Kersten, Marie Jose']","['Nijland ML', 'Koens L', 'Pals ST', 'Berge IJMT', 'Bemelman FJ', 'Kersten MJ']","['Renal Transplant Unit, Department of Nephrology, Academic Medical Center, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Pathology, Academic Medical Center, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Pathology and Lymphoma and Myeloma Center Amsterdam (LYMMCARE), Academic Medical Center, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Renal Transplant Unit, Department of Nephrology, Academic Medical Center, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Renal Transplant Unit, Department of Nephrology, Academic Medical Center, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology and Lymphoma and Myeloma Center Amsterdam (LYMMCARE), Academic Medical Center, Amsterdam, the Netherlands m.j.kersten@amc.uva.nl.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20171221,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,PMC5830383,,,2017/12/23 06:00,2019/03/07 06:00,['2017/12/23 06:00'],"['2017/05/03 00:00 [received]', '2017/12/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/12/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/07 06:00 [medline]', '2017/12/23 06:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.2017.169987 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2017.169987 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2018 Mar;103(3):486-496. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2017.169987.

In this study, we show that the IL6-related stem cell-promoting factor LIF supports PDAC-associated neural remodeling (PANR). LIF was overexpressed in tumor tissue compared with healthy pancreas, but its receptors LIFR and gp130 were expressed only in intratumoral nerves. Cancer cells and stromal cells in PDAC tissues both expressed LIF, but only stromal cells could secrete it. Biological investigations showed that LIF promoted the differentiation of glial nerve sheath Schwann cells and induced their migration by activating JAK/STAT3/AKT signaling. LIF also induced neuronal plasticity in dorsal root ganglia neurons by increasing the number of neurites and the soma area. Notably, injection of LIF-blocking antibody into PDAC-bearing mice reduced intratumoral nerve density, supporting a critical role for LIF function in PANR. In serum from human PDAC patients and mouse models of PDAC, we found that LIF titers positively correlated with intratumoral nerve density. Taken together, our findings suggest LIF as a candidate serum biomarker and diagnostic tool and a possible therapeutic target for limiting the impact of PANR in PDAC pathophysiology and metastatic progression.Significance: This study suggests a target to limit neural remodeling in pancreatic cancer, which contributes to poorer quality of life and heightened metastatic progression in patients.

Here, we investigate the role of Sema7A (semaphorin 7A) in atherosclerosis and its underlying mechanism. APPROACH AND RESULTS: Using genetically engineered Sema7A(-/-)ApoE(-/-) mice, we showed that deletion of Sema7A attenuates atherosclerotic plaque formation primarily in the aorta of ApoE(-/-) mice on a high-fat diet. A higher level of Sema7A in the atheroprone lesser curvature suggests a correlation of Sema7A with disturbed flow. This notion is supported by elevated Sema7A expression in human umbilical venous endothelial cells either subjected to oscillatory shear stress or treated with the PKA (protein kinase A)/CREB (cAMP response element-binding protein) inhibitor H89 (N-[2-(p-bromocinnamylamino)ethyl]-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide.2HCl hydrate). Further studies using the partial carotid artery ligation model showed that disturbed flow in the left carotid artery of Sema7A(+/+)ApoE(-/-) mice promoted the expression of endothelial Sema7A and cell adhesion molecules, leukocyte adhesion, and plaque formation, whereas such changes were attenuated in Sema7A(-/-)ApoE(-/-) mice. Further studies showed that blockage of beta1 integrin, a known Sema7A receptor, or inhibition of FAK (focal adhesion kinase), MEK1/2 (mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1/2), or NF-kappaB (nuclear factor-kappaB) significantly reduced the expression of cell adhesion molecules and THP-1 (human acute monocytic leukemia cell line) monocyte adhesion in Sema7A-overexpressing human umbilical venous endothelial cells. Studies using chimeric mice suggest that vascular, most likely endothelial, Sema7A plays a major role in atherogenesis. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate a significant role of Sema7A in atherosclerosis by mediating endothelial dysfunction in a beta1 integrin-dependent manner.","['Hu, Shuhong', 'Liu, Yifei', 'You, Tao', 'Heath, Jack', 'Xu, Linru', 'Zheng, Xiaowei', 'Wang, Aili', 'Wang, Yinyan', 'Li, Fengchan', 'Yang, Fei', 'Cao, Yiren', 'Zhang, Huayu', 'van Gils, Janine M', 'van Zonneveld, Anton Jan', 'Jo, Hanjoong', 'Wu, Qingyu', 'Zhang, Yonghong', 'Tang, Chaojun', 'Zhu, Li']","['Hu S', 'Liu Y', 'You T', 'Heath J', 'Xu L', 'Zheng X', 'Wang A', 'Wang Y', 'Li F', 'Yang F', 'Cao Y', 'Zhang H', 'van Gils JM', 'van Zonneveld AJ', 'Jo H', 'Wu Q', 'Zhang Y', 'Tang C', 'Zhu L']","['From the Cyrus Tang Hematology Center (S.H., Y.L., T.Y., L.X., Y.W., F.L., F.Y., Y.C., Q.W., C.T., L.Z.), Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health (X.Z., A.W., Y.Z.), Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology of Jiangsu Province (S.H., Y.L., T.Y., Q.W., C.T., L.Z.), and Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Preventive and Translational Medicine for Geriatric Diseases (X.Z., A.W., Q.W., Y.Z.), Soochow University, Suzhou, China; Wallace H.

One such dynamic Nup, called Nup98, has been implicated in gene activation in healthy cells and has been shown to drive leukemogenesis when mutated in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Here we show that in hematopoietic cells, Nup98 binds predominantly to transcription start sites to recruit the Wdr82-Set1A/COMPASS (complex of proteins associated with Set1) complex, which is required for deposition of the histone 3 Lys4 trimethyl (H3K4me3)-activating mark. Depletion of Nup98 or Wdr82 abolishes Set1A recruitment to chromatin and subsequently ablates H3K4me3 at adjacent promoters. Furthermore, expression of a Nup98 fusion protein implicated in aggressive AML causes mislocalization of H3K4me3 at abnormal regions and up-regulation of associated genes. Our findings establish a function of Nup98 in hematopoietic gene activation and provide mechanistic insight into which Nup98 leukemic fusion proteins promote AML.","['Franks, Tobias M', 'McCloskey, Asako', 'Shokirev, Maxim Nikolaievich', 'Benner, Chris', 'Rathore, Annie', 'Hetzer, Martin W']","['Franks TM', 'McCloskey A', 'Shokirev MN', 'Benner C', 'Rathore A', 'Hetzer MW']","['Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Salk Institute for Biological Studies, La Jolla, California 92037, USA.', 'Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Salk Institute for Biological Studies, La Jolla, California 92037, USA.', 'The Razavi Newman Integrative Genomics and Bioinformatics Core, Salk Institute for Biological Studies, La Jolla, California 92037, USA.', 'Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Salk Institute for Biological Studies, La Jolla, California 92037, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, University of California at San Diego, La Jolla, California 92093, USA.', 'Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Salk Institute for Biological Studies, La Jolla, California 92037, USA.', 'Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Salk Institute for Biological Studies, La Jolla, California 92037, USA.']",['eng'],"['P30 CA014195/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM098749/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NS096786/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20171221,United States,Genes Dev,Genes & development,8711660,PMC5769767,['NOTNLM'],"['*Nup98', '*Set1A', '*Wdr82', '*acute myeloid leukemia', '*histone 3 Lys4 trimethylation', '*transcription']",2017/12/23 06:00,2018/02/03 06:00,['2017/12/23 06:00'],"['2017/09/08 00:00 [received]', '2017/11/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/12/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/03 06:00 [medline]', '2017/12/23 06:00 [entrez]']","['gad.306753.117 [pii]', '10.1101/gad.306753.117 [doi]']",ppublish,Genes Dev. 2017 Nov 15;31(22):2222-2234. doi: 10.1101/gad.306753.117.

However, IM resistance is still a challenge in the treatment of CML. Recently, it was reported that exosomes (Exo) were involved in drug resistance. Therefore, the present study investigated whether Exo secreted by human umbilical cord mesenchymal stromal cells (hUC-MSC-Exo) affected the sensitivity of K562 cells to IM. METHODS: hUC-MSC-Exo were isolated and identified. K562 cells were then treated or not with IM (1 micromol/L) in combination with hUC-MSC-Exo (50 microg/mL). Cell viability and apoptosis were determined by cell counting kit 8 (CCK-8) and annexin V/propidium iodide (PI) double staining, respectively. Apoptotic proteins, caspase and their cleaved forms were detected by Western blot. RESULTS: It was shown that hUC-MSC-Exo alone had no effect on cell viability and apoptosis of K562 cells. However, hUC-MSC-Exo promoted IM-induced cell viability inhibition and apoptosis. Moreover, hUC-MSC-Exo enhanced the increased Bax expression and the decreased Bcl-2 expression that were induced by IM. Compared with IM alone, caspase-9 and caspase-3 were further activated by combination of hUC-MSC-Exo with IM. Finally, the effects of hUC-MSC-Exo on K562 cells could be reversed by pretreatment of K562 cells with caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK (30 micromol/L) DISCUSSION: These results indicate that hUC-MSC-Exo enhanced the sensitivity of K562 cells to IM via activation of caspase signaling pathway. Therefore, combining IM with hUC-MSC-Exo could be a promising approach to improve the efficacy of CML treatment.","['Liu, Ying', 'Song, Baoquan', 'Wei, Yimeng', 'Chen, Fang', 'Chi, Ying', 'Fan, Huifang', 'Liu, Na', 'Li, Zongjin', 'Han, Zhongchao', 'Ma, Fengxia']","['Liu Y', 'Song B', 'Wei Y', 'Chen F', 'Chi Y', 'Fan H', 'Liu N', 'Li Z', 'Han Z', 'Ma F']","[""State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Hospital of Blood Diseases, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, People's Republic of China; Central Laboratory, The First Affiliated Hospital of Hebei North University, Hebei, Zhangjiakou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Hospital of Blood Diseases, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Hospital of Blood Diseases, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Hospital of Blood Diseases, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Hospital of Blood Diseases, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, People's Republic of China."", ""School of Medicine, Nankai University, Tianjin, People's Republic of China."", ""School of Medicine, Nankai University, Tianjin, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Hospital of Blood Diseases, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Hospital of Blood Diseases, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, People's Republic of China.

Therapeutic options are limited in patients unsuitable for ASCT. Evidence that androgens might be beneficial in MDS is controversial. We aimed to document the clinical outcomes of patients diagnosed with MDS treated with danazol as first-line therapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed patients diagnosed in our center with MDS according to the World Health Organization 2008 criteria and treated with danazol between 2005 and 2015. Response was defined according to international working group criteria. RESULTS: We included 42 patients treated exclusively with danazol. Median dose was 400 mg/d (range, 100-600 mg/d). Median follow-up was 12 (range, 3-76) months. Twenty-four of these patients (60%) achieved clinical response. Median overall survival was 24 months (95% confidence interval, 5.1-42). Responders were older than nonresponders (P = .025) and had higher baseline hemoglobin concentration (P = .009). No patients discontinued danazol because of toxicity.

Methods THP-1 cells were differentiated by PMA and stimulated by LPS to release inflammatory factors in cell supernatants, like tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin 6 (IL-6), which were detected by ELISA. The doses and durations of both PMA and LPS treatment were optimized to develop the inflammatory cell model. Rolipram was added along with LPS after PMA differentiation to assess the response of cells to the anti-inflammatory agent. Results THP-1 cells showed no significant differences in cell morphology between PMA treatment for 24 hours and for 48 hours, but significantly high levels of TNF-alpha and IL-6 were released under LPS treatment. TNF-alpha level increased significantly after the differentiation by PMA at 100 ng/mL in comparison with that at 50 ng/mL, and it increased in a LPS dose-depended manner untill a plateau at 0.2 mug/mL LPS; the secretion level of IL-6 increased remarkably when THP-1 cells were induced by PMA at 100 ng/mL and stimulated by LPS>/=1 mug/mL. The inflammatory cell model made using PMA at 100 ng/mL and LPS at 0.5 mug/mL was more sensitive to the anti-inflammatory agent rolipram, compared with that by 0.1 mug/mL LPS. Conclusion PMA at 100 ng/mL was selected for the differentiation of THP-1 cells with the enhanced responsiveness to LPS stimulation; THP-1 cells by the induction of PMA at 100 ng/mL coupled with the stimulation of LPS at no less than 0.2 mug/mL was an optimal inflammatory cell model for significant secretion of TNF-alpha and IL-6, which was sensitive to the action of anti-inflammatory agents.","['Zou, Mingyue', 'Xi, Lei', 'Rao, Jingjing', 'Jing, Yixian', 'Liao, Fei', 'Yang, Xiaolan']","['Zou M', 'Xi L', 'Rao J', 'Jing Y', 'Liao F', 'Yang X']","['Ministry-of-Education Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medical Diagnostics, College of Laboratory Medicine, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400016, China.', 'Ministry-of-Education Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medical Diagnostics, College of Laboratory Medicine, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400016, China.', 'Ministry-of-Education Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medical Diagnostics, College of Laboratory Medicine, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400016, China.', 'Ministry-of-Education Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medical Diagnostics, College of Laboratory Medicine, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400016, China.', 'Ministry-of-Education Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medical Diagnostics, College of Laboratory Medicine, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400016, China.', 'Ministry-of-Education Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medical Diagnostics, College of Laboratory Medicine, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400016, China. *Corresponding author, E-mail: xiaolanyang666@yeah.net.']",['chi'],,['Journal Article'],,China,Xi Bao Yu Fen Zi Mian Yi Xue Za Zhi,Xi bao yu fen zi mian yi xue za zhi = Chinese journal of cellular and molecular immunology,101139110,,,,2017/12/23 06:00,2018/06/06 06:00,['2017/12/23 06:00'],"['2017/12/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/12/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/06/06 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Xi Bao Yu Fen Zi Mian Yi Xue Za Zhi. 2017 Nov;33(11):1456-1461.,20180605,11,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents)', '0 (Inflammation Mediators)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Phosphodiesterase 4 Inhibitors)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', 'K676NL63N7 (Rolipram)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Anti-Inflammatory Agents/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Inflammation Mediators/*metabolism', 'Interleukin-6/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/metabolism/pathology', 'Lipopolysaccharides/*pharmacology', 'Macrophages/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Models, Biological', 'Phosphodiesterase 4 Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Rolipram/pharmacology', 'THP-1 Cells', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In almost four decades of scientific research, both viruses have had different fates, HTLV-1 being often upstaged by HIV-1. However, although being very close in terms of genome organization, cellular tropism, and viral replication, HIV-1 and HTLV-1 are not completely commutable in terms of treatment, especially because of the opposite fate of the cells they infect: death versus immortalization, respectively. Nowadays, the antiretroviral therapies developed to treat HIV-1 infected individuals and to limit HIV-1 spread among the human population have a poor or no effect on HTLV-1 infected individuals, and thus, do not prevent the development of HTLV-1-associated diseases, which still lack highly efficient treatments. The present review mainly focuses on the course of HTLV-1 infection, from the initial infection of the host to diseases development and associated treatments, but also investigates HIV-1/HTLV-1 co-infection events and their impact on diseases development.","['Futsch, Nicolas', 'Mahieux, Renaud', 'Dutartre, Helene']","['Futsch N', 'Mahieux R', 'Dutartre H']","['International Center for Research in Infectiology, Retroviral Oncogenesis Laboratory, INSERM U1111-Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1, CNRS, UMR5308, Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon, Universite Lyon, F-69007 Lyon, France. nicolas.futsch@ens-lyon.fr.', 'Equipe labellisee ""Ligue Nationale Contre le Cancer"", France. nicolas.futsch@ens-lyon.fr.', 'International Center for Research in Infectiology, Retroviral Oncogenesis Laboratory, INSERM U1111-Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1, CNRS, UMR5308, Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon, Universite Lyon, F-69007 Lyon, France. renaud.mahieux@ens-lyon.fr.', 'Equipe labellisee ""Ligue Nationale Contre le Cancer"", France. renaud.mahieux@ens-lyon.fr.', 'International Center for Research in Infectiology, Retroviral Oncogenesis Laboratory, INSERM U1111-Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1, CNRS, UMR5308, Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon, Universite Lyon, F-69007 Lyon, France. helene.dutartre@ens-lyon.fr.', 'Equipe labellisee ""Ligue Nationale Contre le Cancer"", France. helene.dutartre@ens-lyon.fr.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20171221,Switzerland,Viruses,Viruses,101509722,PMC5795414,['NOTNLM'],"['*ATLL', '*HIV-1', '*HTLV-1', '*TSP/HAM', '*treatments', '*viral transmission']",2017/12/22 06:00,2018/12/12 06:00,['2017/12/22 06:00'],"['2017/11/30 00:00 [received]', '2017/12/16 00:00 [revised]', '2017/12/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/12/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/12/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/12/12 06:00 [medline]']","['v10010001 [pii]', '10.3390/v10010001 [doi]']",epublish,Viruses. 2017 Dec 21;10(1). pii: v10010001. doi: 10.3390/v10010001.,20181211,1,,IM,"['CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/virology', 'Coinfection/therapy/virology', 'Drug Discovery', 'HIV Infections/complications', 'HTLV-I Infections/complications/*therapy/*transmission/virology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/therapy/virology', 'Paraparesis, Tropical Spastic/therapy/virology', 'Virus Replication']",,,['The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, TKI resistance has remained an unsolved issue. In this study, we investigate the impact of adding arsenic trioxide (ATO) on the action of Dasatinib, a second-generation TKI, in Ph(+) ALL. We show that ATO cooperates with Dasatinib in both TKI-sensitive and resistant Ph(+) ALL cell lines to increase apoptosis and we unravel the underlying mechanisms. Indeed, combining ATO and Dasatinib leads to severe cell apoptosis by activating the UPR apoptotic IRE1/JNK/PUMA axis, while neutralizing the UPR ATF4-dependent anti-apoptotic axis, activated by ATO alone. Additionally, ATO and Dasatinib in combination repress the expression of several genes, which we previously showed to be associated with shorter survival probability in ALL patients. Overall these data support the use of ATO in combination with Dasatinib as a novel therapeutic regimen for Ph(+) ALL patients.","['Wang, Tao', 'Cheng, Chunyan', 'Peng, Lijun', 'Gao, Mengqing', 'Xi, Mengping', 'Rousseaux, Sophie', 'Khochbin, Saadi', 'Wang, Jin', 'Mi, Jianqing']","['Wang T', 'Cheng C', 'Peng L', 'Gao M', 'Xi M', 'Rousseaux S', 'Khochbin S', 'Wang J', 'Mi J']","['State Key Laboratory for Medical Genomics and Department of Hematology, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Collaborative Innovation Center of Systems Biomedicine, Pole Sino-Francais des Sciences du Vivant et Genomique, Rui Jin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'State Key Laboratory for Medical Genomics and Department of Hematology, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Collaborative Innovation Center of Systems Biomedicine, Pole Sino-Francais des Sciences du Vivant et Genomique, Rui Jin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'State Key Laboratory for Medical Genomics and Department of Hematology, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Collaborative Innovation Center of Systems Biomedicine, Pole Sino-Francais des Sciences du Vivant et Genomique, Rui Jin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'State Key Laboratory for Medical Genomics and Department of Hematology, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Collaborative Innovation Center of Systems Biomedicine, Pole Sino-Francais des Sciences du Vivant et Genomique, Rui Jin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'State Key Laboratory for Medical Genomics and Department of Hematology, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Collaborative Innovation Center of Systems Biomedicine, Pole Sino-Francais des Sciences du Vivant et Genomique, Rui Jin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'CNRS UMR 5309, INSERM U1209, Institute for Advanced Biosciences, Universite Grenoble-Alpes, La Tronche, France.', 'CNRS UMR 5309, INSERM U1209, Institute for Advanced Biosciences, Universite Grenoble-Alpes, La Tronche, France.', 'State Key Laboratory for Medical Genomics and Department of Hematology, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Collaborative Innovation Center of Systems Biomedicine, Pole Sino-Francais des Sciences du Vivant et Genomique, Rui Jin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'State Key Laboratory for Medical Genomics and Department of Hematology, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Collaborative Innovation Center of Systems Biomedicine, Pole Sino-Francais des Sciences du Vivant et Genomique, Rui Jin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20171220,England,J Cell Mol Med,Journal of cellular and molecular medicine,101083777,PMC5824394,['NOTNLM'],"['*ATF4', '*IRE1/JNK/PUMA pathway', '*Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukaemia', '*apoptosis', '*arsenic trioxide', '*tyrosine kinase inhibitor']",2017/12/22 06:00,2019/10/23 06:00,['2017/12/22 06:00'],"['2017/07/12 00:00 [received]', '2017/10/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/12/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/23 06:00 [medline]', '2017/12/22 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/jcmm.13436 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Mol Med. 2018 Mar;22(3):1614-1626. doi: 10.1111/jcmm.13436.

One hypothesis suggests that host diversity impedes pathogen virulence, because adaptation to one host genotype carries trade-offs in the ability to replicate and cause disease in other host genotypes. To test this hypothesis, with the simplest level of population diversity within the loci of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), we serially passaged Friend virus complex (FVC) through two rounds, in hosts with either the same MHC genotypes (pure passage) or hosts with different MHC genotypes (alternated passage). Alternated passages showed a significant overall reduction in viral titre (31%) and virulence (54%) when compared to pure passages. Furthermore, a resistant host genotype initially dominated any effects due to MHC diversity; however, when FVC was allowed to adapt to the resistant host genotype, predicted MHC effects emerged; that is, alternated lines show reduced virulence. These data indicate serial exposure to diverse MHC genotypes is an impediment to pathogen adaptation, suggesting genetic variation at MHC loci is important for limiting virulence in a rapidly evolving pathogen and supports negative frequency-dependent selection as a force maintaining MHC diversity in host populations.","['Cornwall, D H', 'Kubinak, J L', 'Zachary, E', 'Stark, D L', 'Seipel, D', 'Potts, W K']","['Cornwall DH', 'Kubinak JL', 'Zachary E', 'Stark DL', 'Seipel D', 'Potts WK']","['Department of Biology, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, USA.', 'University of South Carolina School of Medicine, Columbia, SC, USA.', 'Department of Biology, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, USA.', 'Department of Biology, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, USA.', 'Department of Biology, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, USA.', 'Department of Biology, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, USA.']",['eng'],['R01 GM109500/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20180112,Switzerland,J Evol Biol,Journal of evolutionary biology,8809954,,['NOTNLM'],"['*ecology', '*evolution', '*experimental evolution', '*major histocompatibility complex', '*virology', '*virulence']",2017/12/22 06:00,2019/03/13 06:00,['2017/12/22 06:00'],"['2017/02/22 00:00 [received]', '2017/11/30 00:00 [revised]', '2017/12/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/12/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/13 06:00 [medline]', '2017/12/22 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/jeb.13225 [doi]'],ppublish,J Evol Biol. 2018 Feb;31(2):314-322. doi: 10.1111/jeb.13225.

METHODS: This was a retrospective nationwide questionnaire survey of delivery at >/=22 weeks of gestation in CCS at perinatal centers registered with the Japanese Perinatologists Association between 2010 and 2014. We evaluated the maternal characteristics, pregnancy and neonatal outcomes and the relationship between cancer treatment and these outcomes. RESULTS: The total number of CCS was 61, and the total number of deliveries was 71, corresponding to 0.019% of total deliveries. Regarding cancer, 46% of the patients had had leukemia. Epilepsy was seen in seven (11%). Mean gestational age at delivery was 37.9 weeks. The rate of preterm delivery was 24%. Mean birthweight was 2,718 g. There were three congenital anomalies (4.2%). The rate of preterm delivery was higher and mean birthweight lower in the women treated with radiotherapy than in those without radiotherapy (42% vs 16%, P = 0.025; 2,436 +/- 737 g vs 2,827 +/- 483 g, P = 0.010). The adjusted OR of radiotherapy for preterm deliveries was 3.53 (P = 0.049). CONCLUSIONS: Although the number of deliveries by CCS was low in Japan, the pregnancy outcomes were favorable. The important points for managing pregnancy in CCS were preterm delivery as an obstetric complication, especially in CCS who had been treated with radiotherapy, and epilepsy as a maternal complication, which may be related to previously received treatment.","['Sekiguchi, Masaki', 'Miyoshi, Yoko', 'Kikuchi, Norihiko', 'Sago, Haruhiko']","['Sekiguchi M', 'Miyoshi Y', 'Kikuchi N', 'Sago H']","['Center for Maternal-Fetal, Neonatal and Reproductive Medicine, National Center for Child Health and Development, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Shinshu University School of Medicine, Matsumoto, Japan.', 'Center for Maternal-Fetal, Neonatal and Reproductive Medicine, National Center for Child Health and Development, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20180212,Australia,Pediatr Int,Pediatrics international : official journal of the Japan Pediatric Society,100886002,,['NOTNLM'],"['cancer survivor', 'childhood cancer', 'pregnancy outcome', 'preterm delivery', 'radiotherapy']",2017/12/22 06:00,2018/07/28 06:00,['2017/12/22 06:00'],"['2017/08/23 00:00 [received]', '2017/11/19 00:00 [revised]', '2017/12/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/12/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/07/28 06:00 [medline]', '2017/12/22 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ped.13483 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Int. 2018 Mar;60(3):254-258. doi: 10.1111/ped.13483.

This study evaluated a Web-based cognitive rehabilitation therapy program (eReCog) in cancer survivors compared with a waitlist control group. METHODS: Adult cancer survivors with self-reported cognitive symptoms who had completed primary treatment at least 6 months prior were recruited. Participants completed telephone screening and were randomly allocated to the 4-week online intervention or waitlist. Primary outcome was perceived cognitive impairment assessed with the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Cognitive Function version 3. Secondary outcomes were additional measures of subjective cognitive functioning, objective cognitive functioning, and psychosocial variables. RESULTS: Seventy-six women were allocated to the intervention (n = 40) or waitlist (n = 36). A significant interaction was found on the instrumental activities of daily living measure of self-reported prospective memory whereby the intervention group reported a greater reduction in prospective memory failures than the waitlist group. Interaction trends were noted on perceived cognitive impairments (P = .089) and executive functioning (P = .074). No significant interactions were observed on other measures of objective cognitive functioning or psychosocial variables. CONCLUSIONS: The Web-based intervention shows promise for improving self-reported cognitive functioning in adult cancer survivors. Further research is warranted to better understand the mechanisms by which the intervention might contribute to improved self-reported cognition.","['Mihuta, Mary E', 'Green, Heather J', 'Shum, David H K']","['Mihuta ME', 'Green HJ', 'Shum DHK']","['Menzies Health Institute Queensland and School of Applied Psychology, Griffith University, Gold Coast, Australia.', 'Menzies Health Institute Queensland and School of Applied Psychology, Griffith University, Gold Coast, Australia.', 'Menzies Health Institute Queensland and School of Applied Psychology, Griffith University, Gold Coast, Australia.', 'Neuropsychology and Applied Cognitive Neuroscience Laboratory, CAS Key Laboratory of Mental Health, Institute of Psychology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180215,England,Psychooncology,Psycho-oncology,9214524,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Web-based', '*adult', '*cancer', '*cognitive rehabilitation', '*oncology', '*online', '*survivors']",2017/12/22 06:00,2019/04/30 06:00,['2017/12/22 06:00'],"['2017/01/30 00:00 [received]', '2017/11/02 00:00 [revised]', '2017/12/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/12/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/30 06:00 [medline]', '2017/12/22 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pon.4615 [doi]'],ppublish,Psychooncology. 2018 Apr;27(4):1172-1179. doi: 10.1002/pon.4615.

Actually, early death (ED) is currently thought as a major challenge in APL. ATO has been reported to inhibit platelet function in vitro, and whether it increases the ED rate by exacerbating the hemorrhagic symptoms remains to be investigated. METHODS: Effects of ATO on platelet aggregation and adhesion were evaluated in vitro and in thirty-two complete remission (CR) and four newly diagnosed APL patients. Furthermore, concentrations of plasma total arsenic were monitored in APL patients via ICP-MS. RESULTS: The inhibition of platelet function, either aggregation or adhesion, did occur in vitro when the concentration of ATO reached 2 mumol/L. However, in CR APL patients receiving ATO with normal platelet count, the platelets responded normally when being activated and so did those in the newly diagnosed patients with thrombocytopenia. Our data further showed that the conventional dosage of ATO reached a plasma concentration substantially below the required concentration to inhibit platelets. CONCLUSIONS: In the first-line treatment of APL, the use of ATO is safe and effective and does not compromise the hemostatic potential that may eventually increase ED rate.","['Cui, Wen', 'Wang, Jin',

However, there is still uncertainty as to the risk to the general population from exposure to lower environmental levels of benzene. To estimate the excess risk of leukemia from low-dose benzene exposure, various methods for incorporating epidemiological data in quantitative risk assessment were utilized. Tobacco smoke was identified as one of the main potential sources of benzene exposure and was the focus of this exposure assessment, allowing further investigation of the role of benzene in smoking-induced leukemia. Potency estimates for benzene were generated from individual occupational studies and meta-analysis data, and an exposure assessment for two smoking subgroups (light and heavy smokers) carried out. Subsequently, various techniques, including life-table analysis, were then used to evaluate both the excess lifetime risk and the contribution of benzene to smoking-induced leukemia and AML. The excess lifetime risk for smokers was estimated at between two and six additional leukemia deaths in 10,000 and one to three additional AML deaths in 10,000. The contribution of benzene to smoking-induced leukemia was estimated at between 9% and 24% (Upper CL 14-31%). For AML this contribution was estimated as 11-30% (Upper CL 22-60%). From the assessments carried out here, it appears there is an increased risk of leukemia from low-level exposure to benzene and that benzene may contribute up to a third of smoking-induced leukemia. Comparable results from using methods with varying degrees of complexity were generated.","['Fiebelkorn, Stacy', 'Meredith, Clive']","['Fiebelkorn S', 'Meredith C']","['British American Tobacco, R&D Centre, Southampton, SO15 8TL, UK.', 'British American Tobacco, R&D Centre, Southampton, SO15 8TL, UK.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20171219,United States,Risk Anal,Risk analysis : an official publication of the Society for Risk Analysis,8109978,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Benzene', '*epidemiology', '*leukemia', '*tobacco smoke']",2017/12/22 06:00,2018/11/27 06:00,['2017/12/22 06:00'],"['2015/12/30 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/29 00:00 [revised]', '2017/10/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/12/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/11/27 06:00 [medline]', '2017/12/22 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/risa.12956 [doi]'],ppublish,Risk Anal. 2018 Jul;38(7):1490-1501. doi: 10.1111/risa.12956.

The objective of the current study was to test for the presence of BLV and HPV in the same breast tissue specimens to determine whether the viruses were associated with breast cancer either singly or together. METHODS: Archival formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded breast tissue sections from 216 women were received from The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center along with patient diagnosis. In situ polymerase chain reaction and/or DNA hybridization methods were used to detect targeted DNA segments of BLV and HPV. Standard statistical methods were used to calculate age-adjusted odds ratios, attributable risk, and P values for the trend related to the association between presence of a virus and a diagnosis of breast disease. RESULTS: Women diagnosed with breast cancer were significantly more likely to have BLV DNA in their breast tissue compared with women with benign diagnoses and no history of breast cancer. Women with breast pathology classified as premalignant and no history of breast cancer also were found to have an elevated risk of harboring BLV DNA in their breast tissue. HPV status was not associated with malignancy, premalignant breast disease, or the presence of BLV in the breast tissues. CONCLUSIONS: The data from the current study supported previous findings of a significant association between BLV DNA in breast tissue and a diagnosis of breast cancer, but did not demonstrate oncogenic strains of HPV associated with breast cancer or the presence of BLV DNA in breast tissue. The authors believe the findings of the current study contribute to overall knowledge regarding a possible causal role for viruses in human breast cancer. Cancer 2018;124:1342-9.

The objective of this analysis was to develop a prediction model for a sustained molecular response with BCR-ABL1 level <0.0032% on the international scale (MR(4.5) ) for at least 2 years according to BCR-ABL1 levels achieved within the first 12 months of therapy. METHODS: Data for 603 patients with newly diagnosed chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase in consecutive prospective clinical trials were analyzed. The best fit average molecular response was defined by robust linear regression models, with which the average molecular levels were defined. The minimum acceptable molecular response was defined by quantile regression for the 95th percentile, with which the worst 5% BCR-ABL1 levels were identified. RESULTS: In 603 patients with a median follow-up of 103 months, 2002 BCR-ABL1-level data points within 1 year of tyrosine kinase inhibitors were identified. The regression equation for the best fit average levels for a sustained MR(4.5) was Log10 (PCR) = -0.1424 x (Months) - 0.8668, and the regression equation for minimum acceptable levels was Log10 (PCR) = -0.1403 x (Months) + 0.6142 (where PCR indicates polymerase chain reaction). To achieve a sustained MR(4.5) , the best fit average levels were 0.051%, 0.019%, 0.007%, and 0.003% at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months, respectively; the minimum acceptable levels were 1.561%, 0.592%, 0.225%, and 0.085% at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This model proposes optimal values that predict the highest probability of reaching such a goal. These values can be used to guide therapy when a sustained MR(4.5) is the objective.

The AALL1131 study evaluated postinduction therapy using cyclophosphamide (CPM), etoposide (ETOP), and clofarabine (CLOF) for patients with VHR B-ALL. METHODS: Patients who were 1 to 30 years old and had VHR B-ALL received modified Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster therapy after induction and were randomized to 1) CPM, cytarabine, mercaptopurine, vincristine (VCR), and pegaspargase (control arm), 2) CPM, ETOP, VCR, and pegaspargase (experimental arm 1), or 3) CPM, ETOP, CLOF (30 mg/m(2) /d x 5), VCR, and pegaspargase (experimental arm 2) during the second half of consolidation and delayed intensification. RESULTS: The rates of grade 4/5 infections and grade 3/4 pancreatitis were significantly increased in experimental arm 2. The dose of CLOF was, therefore, reduced to 20 mg/m(2) /d x 5, and myeloid growth factor was required after CLOF administration. Despite these changes, 4 of 39 patients (10.3%) developed grade 4 infections, with 1 of these patients developing a grade 5 acute kidney injury attributed to CLOF, whereas only 1 of 46 patients (2.2%) in experimental arm 1 developed grade 4 infections, and there were no grade 4/5 infections in the control arm (n = 20). Four patients in experimental arm 2 had prolonged cytopenias for >60 days, whereas none did in the control arm or experimental arm 1. Counts failed to recover for 2 of these patients, one having a grade 5 acute kidney injury and the other removed from protocol therapy; both events occurred 92 days after the start of consolidation part 2. CONCLUSIONS: In AALL1131, CLOF, administered with CPM and ETOP, was associated with unacceptable toxicity. Cancer 2018;124:1150-9.

However, studies on long-term adverse effects and in the ethnic population are lacking. OBJECTIVE: To study the long-term mucocutaneous adverse effects of imatinib and factors predicting these adverse effects. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, consenting adult chronic myeloid leukemia patients on imatinib for more than 250 days were recruited. The details of imatinib treatment were retrieved from hematology clinic records. RESULTS: Four hundred and thirty-eight patients who were on imatinib for a mean duration of 1820 days were recruited. A mean number of 1.42 +/- 0.98 cutaneous adverse effects were seen per patient. Melasma-like pigmentation, periorbital edema, oral lichenoid reaction, cutaneous hypopigmentation, and vesicobullous eruptions were seen in 236 (53.9%), 81 (18.5%), 70 (16%), 42 (9.6%), and 12 (2.7%) patients, respectively. Drug-induced cutaneous eruptions (9.1%) and cutaneous hypopigmentation (9.6%) were seen less frequently. Cutaneous hyperpigmentation was more likely seen in younger patients (P = 0.001) and females (P < 0.001). On multivariate analysis, female gender was a significant risk factor for developing cutaneous hyperpigmentation and periorbital edema. CONCLUSION: Cutaneous hyperpigmentation and periorbital edema are common long-term adverse effects of imatinib in Indian patients. Female gender is a significant risk factor for the development of both these adverse effects.","['Vinay, Keshavamurthy', 'Yanamandra, Uday', 'Dogra, Sunil', 'Handa, Sanjeev', 'Suri, Vikas', 'Kumari, Savita', 'Khadwal, Alka', 'Prakash, Gaurav', 'Lad, Deepesh', 'Varma, Subhash', 'Malhotra, Pankaj']","['Vinay K', 'Yanamandra U', 'Dogra S', 'Handa S', 'Suri V', 'Kumari S', 'Khadwal A', 'Prakash G', 'Lad D', 'Varma S', 'Malhotra P']","['Department of Dermatology, Venereology and Leprology, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India.', 'Department of Hematology, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India.', 'Department of Dermatology, Venereology and Leprology, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India.', 'Department of Dermatology, Venereology and Leprology, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India.', 'Department of Hematology, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India.', 'Department of Hematology, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India.', 'Department of Hematology, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India.', 'Department of Hematology, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India.', 'Department of Hematology, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India.', 'Department of Hematology, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India.', 'Department of Hematology, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20171220,England,Int J Dermatol,International journal of dermatology,0243704,,,,2017/12/22 06:00,2018/09/19 06:00,['2017/12/22 06:00'],"['2017/04/12 00:00 [received]', '2017/10/02 00:00 [revised]', '2017/11/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/12/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/09/19 06:00 [medline]', '2017/12/22 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ijd.13852 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Dermatol. 2018 Mar;57(3):332-338. doi: 10.1111/ijd.13852.

However, data from patients who received treatment on a frontline regimen without cranial irradiation are limited, and no genome-wide analysis has been reported. METHODS: Lumbar BMD was evaluated by quantitative computed tomography at diagnosis, after 120 weeks of continuation therapy, and after 2 years off therapy in pediatric patients with ALL (ages 2-18 years at diagnosis) who were treated on the St. Jude Total XV Protocol. Clinical, pharmacokinetic, and genetic risk factors associated with decreased BMD Z-scores were evaluated. RESULTS: The median BMD Z-score in 363 patients was 0.06 at diagnosis, declined to -1.08 at week 120, but partly recovered to -0.72 after 2 years off therapy; BMD in patients with low BMD Z-scores at diagnosis remained low after therapy. Older age (>/=10 years vs 2-9.9 years at diagnosis; P < .001), a higher BMD Z-score at diagnosis (P = .001), and a greater area under the plasma drug concentration-time curve for dexamethasone in weeks 7 and 8 of continuation therapy (P = .001) were associated with a greater decrease in BMD Z-score from diagnosis to week 120. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms in 2 genes important in osteogenesis and bone mineralization (COL11A1 [reference single-nucleotide polymorphism rs2622849]; P = 2.39 x 10(-7) ] and NELL1 [rs11025915]; P = 4.07 x 10(-6) ]) were associated with a decreased BMD Z-score. NELL1 (P = .003) also was associated with a greater dexamethasone area under the plasma drug concentration-time curve.

Since the discovery of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), CML, once a fatal disease, has become a chronic illness if managed appropriately. Changing treatment landscape has unsurfaced the challenge of TKI resistance that is clinically difficult to overcome. RECENT FINDINGS: In this review, we discuss the concept of TKI resistance and pathways leading to the resistance which allows for a survival advantage to CML LSCs. Aside from BCR-ABL-dependent mechanisms of resistance which involves aberrant expression in the regulatory pumps involving efflux and influx of the TKI affecting drug bioavailability, activation of alternate survival pathways may be accountable for primary or secondary resistance. Activation of these pathways, intrinsically and extrinsically to LSCs, may be mediated through various upstream and downstream signaling as well as conditions affecting the microenvironment. Several therapeutic approaches that combine TKI with an additional agent that inhibits the activation of an alternate pathway have been studied as part of clinical trials which we will discuss here. SUMMARY: We categorize the resistance into BCR-ABL-dependent and BCR-ABL-independent subgroups to further describe the complex molecular pathways which can potentially serve as a therapeutic target. We further discuss novel combination strategies currently in early or advanced phase clinical trials aimed to overcome the TKI resistance. We further highlight the need for further research despite the tremendous strides already made in the management of CML.","['Talati, Chetasi', 'Pinilla-Ibarz, Javier']","['Talati C', 'Pinilla-Ibarz J']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of South Florida.', 'Department of Malignant Hematology, H.

Although these agents induce responses in up to 40% of patients, most patients ultimately experience loss of response. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of the different therapies under development for MDS after HMA therapy. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent advances in the understanding of MDS pathogenesis have led to the development of new potential therapies after HMA failure. Newer HMAs, less susceptible to in-vivo deamination, such as guadecitabine or ASTX727 have shown activity. Alterations of immune checkpoints in MDS have led to multiple clinical trials evaluating the activity of monoclonal antibodies targeting these proteins (pembrolizumab, nivolumab, ipilimumab). Different combinations and new formulations of cytotoxic agents, such as clofarabine or CPX-351, are newer options for specific subsets of patients. Finally, targeted agents inhibiting multiple kinases (rigosertib), BCL2 (venetoclax) or mutant IDH1 (ivosidenib), IDH2 (enasidenib), FLT3 (sorafenib, midostaurin) or spliceosome components (H3B-8800) are other novel options. SUMMARY: Despite the poor prognosis associated with HMA failure, clinical trials, new cytotoxic agents and allogeneic stem-cell transplantation, can offer therapeutic opportunities for these patients for whom there is no standard of care.","['Montalban-Bravo, Guillermo', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Jabbour, Elias']","['Montalban-Bravo G', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Jabbour E']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,,,,2017/12/22 06:00,2019/01/12 06:00,['2017/12/22 06:00'],"['2017/12/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/12 06:00 [medline]', '2017/12/22 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/MOH.0000000000000400 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2018 Mar;25(2):146-153. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0000000000000400.,20190111,2,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Ipilimumab)', '2KT4YN1DP7 (guadecitabine)', '31YO63LBSN (Nivolumab)', 'DPT0O3T46P (pembrolizumab)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/*therapeutic use', 'Azacitidine/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance/*drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Ipilimumab/*therapeutic use', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy/metabolism/mortality/pathology', 'Nivolumab/*therapeutic use']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although this pattern was discovered more than sixty years ago, it remains an open question to explain its ubiquity. Here, we propose an explanation based on evolutionary dynamics on graphs. For simple models of a mutant or pathogen invading a network-structured population of healthy cells, we show that skewed distributions of incubation periods emerge for a wide range of assumptions about invader fitness, competition dynamics, and network structure. The skewness stems from stochastic mechanisms associated with two classic problems in probability theory: the coupon collector and the random walk. Unlike previous explanations that rely crucially on heterogeneity, our results hold even for homogeneous populations. Thus, we predict that two equally healthy individuals subjected to equal doses of equally pathogenic agents may, by chance alone, show remarkably different time courses of disease.","['Ottino-Loffler, Bertrand', 'Scott, Jacob G', 'Strogatz, Steven H']","['Ottino-Loffler B', 'Scott JG', 'Strogatz SH']","['Center for Applied Mathematics, Cornell University, Ithaca, United States.', 'Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, United States.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, United States.', 'Center for Applied Mathematics, Cornell University, Ithaca, United States.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20171221,England,Elife,eLife,101579614,PMC5739548,['NOTNLM'],"['*complex networks', '*computational biology', '*evolutionary graph theory', '*human', '*incubation period', '*infectious disease', '*mathematical model', '*systems biology']",2017/12/22 06:00,2018/07/17 06:00,['2017/12/22 06:00'],"['2017/07/06 00:00 [received]', '2017/11/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/12/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/12/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/07/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.7554/eLife.30212 [doi]'],epublish,Elife. 2017 Dec 21;6. doi: 10.7554/eLife.30212.,20180716,,,IM,"['Animals', '*Biological Variation, Population', 'Biostatistics', 'Humans', '*Infectious Disease Incubation Period', 'Time Factors']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-6839-5510', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2971-7673', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2923-3118']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two-thirds of patients switched to nilotinib treatment due to lack of imatinib efficacy. Of 146 evaluable patients, 16 (11.0%) (95% confidence interval: 6.4-17.2%) achieved uMR(4) , defined as undetectable molecular disease in cDNA with MR(4) sensitivity (>/=10 000 ABL1 transcripts) at 18 months and confirmed at 24 months (primary endpoint). Among patients without major molecular response (MMR) or deep molecular response (DMR) at study entry, 66.3% achieved MMR and 44.2% DMR within a median of 5.7 and 6.24 months, respectively. Fifty-three patients (36.3%) have prematurely terminated the study before 24 months of follow-up, primarily due to nilotinib treatment discontinuation (n = 43; 29.5%), mainly motivated by treatment intolerance (n = 27; 18.5%) and inefficacy (n = 10; 6.8%). The most frequent extra-haematological adverse events (AEs) reported as related to treatment with nilotinib were pruritus (16.4%), asthenia (13.7%) and dry skin (13.0%). Ischaemic cardiovascular AEs were reported in 18 patients (12.3%).

Some studies have assessed the long-term morbidity after childhood cancer treatment in the developing countries. This study was conducted to assess the spectrum of late effects of cancer treatment in paediatric cancer survivors. METHODS: Evaluation of the first 300 patients who completed five years of follow up in the after treatment completion clinic was done. Details of primary diagnosis, treatment received and current clinical status were noted. The spectrum of late effects was ascertained by appropriate investigations. RESULTS: Haematological malignancies comprised 25 per cent of total cases. Most common primary diagnosis comprised acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, retinoblastoma and Hodgkin's lymphoma. The median age at evaluation and follow up was 14 and 8.5 yr, respectively. Twenty three per cent (69) of the survivors had a minimal disability (growth retardation or underweight), 13 per cent (39) had moderate disabilities needing medical attention (hepatitis B surface antigen positive, myocardial dysfunction, azoospermia and hypothyroidism), while two per cent had major/life-threatening disabilities (mental retardation, liver disease and mortality). Eleven patients relapsed on follow up, of those five patients expired. Two second malignancies were recorded during the period of follow up. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: Late effects were of concern; however, severe disability (Grade 3-5) was seen in only two per cent survivors. Lifelong follow up of childhood cancer survivors is required to assess cancer-related morbidity, occurrence of a secondary neoplasm, to facilitate timely diagnosis and to implement remedial or preventive interventions to optimize health outcomes. Awareness towards the existence of late effects of cancer therapy is required among parents, patients and health professionals.","['Seth, Rachna', 'Singh, Amitabh', 'Seth, Sandeep', 'Sapra, Savita']","['Seth R', 'Singh A', 'Seth S', 'Sapra S']","['Department of Pediatrics, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.', 'Department of Pediatrics, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.', 'Department of Cardiology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.', 'Department of Pediatrics, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,India,Indian J Med Res,The Indian journal of medical research,0374701,PMC5761031,,,2017/12/22 06:00,2018/07/28 06:00,['2017/12/22 06:00'],"['2017/12/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/12/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/07/28 06:00 [medline]']","['IndianJMedRes_2017_146_2_216_221092 [pii]', '10.4103/ijmr.IJMR_196_16 [doi]']",ppublish,Indian J Med Res. 2017 Aug;146(2):216-223. doi: 10.4103/ijmr.IJMR_196_16.,20180727,2,,IM,"['*Cancer Survivors', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hodgkin Disease/drug therapy/*epidemiology/pathology', 'Humans', 'India/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*epidemiology/pathology', 'Retinoblastoma/drug therapy/*epidemiology/pathology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our understanding of the genomic landscape of AML has improved prognostic accuracy and lead to the development of targeted therapies. In 2017 the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved midostaurin, gemtuzumab ozogamicin, CPX-351 and enasidenib for the treatment of AML. There are many novel agents under investigation for treatment of AML, but those that inhibit the anti-apoptotic molecule BCL-2 are of particular interest due to strong pre-clinical data and early promising clinical results. Areas covered: This article provides an overview of the pathophysiology of BCL-2 inhibition in AML, biomarkers and resistance mechanisms to BCL-2 inhibition and an update of results of the preclinical and clinical trials. Expert commentary: Venetoclax-based combination treatment for newly diagnosed elderly patients for whom intense chemotherapy is not an option may be the first setting in which this agent may be employed in AML. Based on pre-clinical evidence, BCL-2 inhibition may be useful in relapsed/refractory disease in conjunction with cytotoxic therapy, but has modest single agent activity.","['Yogarajah, Meera', 'Stone, Richard M']","['Yogarajah M', 'Stone RM']","['a Brody School of Medicine , East Carolina University , Greenville , NC , USA.', 'b Dana Farber Cancer Institute , Harvard Medical School , Boston , MA , USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20180103,England,Expert Rev Hematol,Expert review of hematology,101485942,,['NOTNLM'],"['*ABT 199', '*AML', '*BCL-2 inhibitors', '*novel agents in AML', '*venetoclax']",2017/12/22 06:00,2018/12/21 06:00,['2017/12/22 06:00'],"['2017/12/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/12/21 06:00 [medline]', '2017/12/22 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/17474086.2018.1420474 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Rev Hematol. 2018 Feb;11(2):145-154. doi: 10.1080/17474086.2018.1420474.

However, the molecular events that occur in variants of t(8;21) are not well characterized. In the present study, we report genetic features of a variant three-way translocation of t(8;12;21)(q22;p11;q22) in a patient with AML. In this patient, leukemia cells lacked azurophilic granules, which does not correspond with the classic features of t(8;21). RNA-seq analysis revealed that TM7SF3 at 12p11 was fused to VPS13B at 8q22 and VPS13B to RUNX1, in addition to RUNX1-RUNX1T1. VPS13B was located near RUNX1T1 and both were localized at the same chromosomal bands. The reading frames of TM7SF3 and VPS13B did not match to those of VPS13B and RUNX1, respectively. Disruption of VPS13B causes Cohen syndrome, which presents intermittent neutropenia with a left-shifted granulopoiesis in the bone marrow. Disruption of VPS13B may thus cause the unusual features of RUNX1-RUNX1T1 leukemia. Our case indicates that rearrangement of VPS13B may be additional genetic events in variant t(8;21).","['Abe, Akihiro', 'Yamamoto, Yukiya', 'Katsumi, Akira', 'Okamoto, Akinao', 'Tokuda, Masutaka', 'Inaguma, Yoko', 'Yamamoto, Kiyoko', 'Yanada, Masamitsu', 'Kanie, Tadaharu', 'Tomita, Akihiro', 'Akatsuka, Yoshiki', 'Okamoto, Masataka', 'Kameyama, Toshiki', 'Mayeda, Akila', 'Emi, Nobuhiko']","['Abe A', 'Yamamoto Y', 'Katsumi A', 'Okamoto A', 'Tokuda M', 'Inaguma Y', 'Yamamoto K', 'Yanada M', 'Kanie T', 'Tomita A', 'Akatsuka Y', 'Okamoto M', 'Kameyama T', 'Mayeda A', 'Emi N']","['Department of Hematology, Fujita Health University, 98 Dengakugakubo, Toyoake, Aichi, 470-1192, Japan. aakihiro@fijita-hu.ac.jp.', 'Department of Hematology, Fujita Health University, 98 Dengakugakubo, Toyoake, Aichi, 470-1192, Japan.', 'National Center for Geriatrics and Gerontology, Obu, Aichi, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Fujita Health University, 98 Dengakugakubo, Toyoake, Aichi, 470-1192, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Fujita Health University, 98 Dengakugakubo, Toyoake, Aichi, 470-1192, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Fujita Health University, 98 Dengakugakubo, Toyoake, Aichi, 470-1192, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Fujita Health University, 98 Dengakugakubo, Toyoake, Aichi, 470-1192, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Fujita Health University, 98 Dengakugakubo, Toyoake, Aichi, 470-1192, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Fujita Health University, 98 Dengakugakubo, Toyoake, Aichi, 470-1192, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Fujita Health University, 98 Dengakugakubo, Toyoake, Aichi, 470-1192, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Fujita Health University, 98 Dengakugakubo, Toyoake, Aichi, 470-1192, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Fujita Health University, 98 Dengakugakubo, Toyoake, Aichi, 470-1192, Japan.', 'Division of Gene Expression Mechanism, Institute for Comprehensive Medical Science, Fujita Health University, Toyoake, Aichi, Japan.', 'Division of Gene Expression Mechanism, Institute for Comprehensive Medical Science, Fujita Health University, Toyoake, Aichi, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Fujita Health University, 98 Dengakugakubo, Toyoake, Aichi, 470-1192, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20171220,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,,['NOTNLM'],"['3-Way translocation', 'AML', 'RUNX1-RUNX1T1', 'TM7SF3', 'VPS13B']",2017/12/22 06:00,2018/09/07 06:00,['2017/12/22 06:00'],"['2017/06/21 00:00 [received]', '2017/12/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/12/06 00:00 [revised]', '2017/12/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/09/07 06:00 [medline]', '2017/12/22 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12185-017-2387-x [doi]', '10.1007/s12185-017-2387-x [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2018 Aug;108(2):208-212. doi: 10.1007/s12185-017-2387-x.

We have previously shown that nanoliposomal C6-ceramide (CNL) is an effective therapy in an in vivo murine model of CLL. However, the key signaling pathways mediating CNL-induced cell death in CLL remains unknown. We hypothesized that CNL targets STAT3, a critical regulator of hematopoietic biology. We observed that CNL treatment reduced phosphorylated STAT3 at both Y705 and S727 residues in CLL cell lines and patient cells. This, in turn, reduced STAT3 transcriptional activity and expression of critical STAT3-dependent survival factors like Mcl-1 and survivin. The effect of CNL on STAT3 was further confirmed ex vivo as shown by reduced STAT3 phosphorylation in xenograft tumors obtained from mice treated with CNL. CNL suppressed STAT3 phosphorylation at Y705 and S727 through reduction in BTK activity and MEK1/2 kinase/PKC activities, respectively. Moreover, a synergistic reduction in CLL cell viability was observed on co-treatment with CNL and the BTK inhibitor, ibrutinib. Expression of an oncogenic form of STAT3 conferred partial resistance to CNL, providing confirmation that STAT3 mediates CNL-induced cell death. Taken together, these findings provide the first body of evidence demonstrating ceramide regulation of STAT3 phosphorylation. These results are also the first to demonstrate an effect of ceramide on BTK, a critical kinase mediating the B-cell receptor signaling in CLL cells and suggest a novel and synergistic combination of CNL and BTK inhibitors for CLL treatment.","['Doshi, Ushma A', 'Shaw, Jeremy', 'Fox, Todd E', 'Claxton, David F', 'Loughran, Thomas P', 'Kester, Mark']","['Doshi UA', 'Shaw J', 'Fox TE', 'Claxton DF', 'Loughran TP', 'Kester M']","['Department of Pharmacology, Penn State College of Medicine, Hershey, PA, USA.', 'Department of Experimental Pathology, University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, VA, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacology, University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, VA, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Penn State Milton S Hershey Medical Center and College of Medicine, Hershey, PA, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, VA, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacology, University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, VA, USA.', 'NanoSTAR Institute, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, USA.']",['eng'],"['P01 CA171983/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA044579/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA009109/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20171027,England,Signal Transduct Target Ther,Signal transduction and targeted therapy,101676423,PMC5661641,,,2017/12/22 06:00,2017/12/22 06:01,['2017/12/22 06:00'],"['2017/02/05 00:00 [received]', '2017/06/09 00:00 [revised]', '2017/08/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/12/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/12/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/22 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1038/sigtrans.2017.51 [doi]'],epublish,Signal Transduct Target Ther. 2017 Oct 27;2:17051. doi: 10.1038/sigtrans.2017.51. eCollection 2017.,20210202,,,,,,,"['MK-Penn State Research Foundation (PSRF) has licensed ceramide nanoliposomes to', 'Keystone Nano, Inc.

The 5-year survival rates remain frustratingly low (65% for children and 26% for adults). Resistance to frontline chemotherapy (usually cytarabine) often develops; therefore a new treatment modality is needed. Bcl-2 family proteins play an important role in balancing cell survival and apoptosis. The antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins have been found to be dysregulated in AML. ABT-199, a BH3 mimetic, was developed to target antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2. Although ABT-199 has demonstrated promising results, resistance occurs. Previous studies in AML show that ABT-199 alone decreases the association of proapoptotic protein Bim with Bcl-2, but this is compensated by increased association of Bim with prosurvival protein Mcl-1, stabilizing Mcl-1, resulting in resistance to ABT-199. In this study, we investigated the antileukemic activity of the Mcl-1-selective inhibitor A-1210477 in combination with ABT-199 in AML cells. We found that A-1210477 synergistically induced apoptosis with ABT-199 in AML cell lines and primary patient samples. The synergistic induction of apoptosis was decreased upon Bak, Bax and Bim knockdown. While A-1210477 treatment alone also increased Mcl-1 protein levels, combination with ABT-199 reduced binding of Bim to Mcl-1. Our results demonstrate that sequestration of Bim by Mcl-1, a mechanism of ABT-199 resistance, can be abrogated by combined treatment with the Mcl-1 inhibitor A-1201477.","['Luedtke, Daniel A', 'Niu, Xiaojia', 'Pan, Yihang', 'Zhao, Jianyun', 'Liu, Shuang', 'Edwards, Holly', 'Chen, Kang', 'Lin, Hai', 'Taub, Jeffrey W', 'Ge, Yubin']","['Luedtke DA', 'Niu X', 'Pan Y', 'Zhao J', 'Liu S', 'Edwards H', 'Chen K', 'Lin H', 'Taub JW', 'Ge Y']","['Cancer Biology Graduate Program, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, Michigan, USA.', 'National Engineering Laboratory for AIDS Vaccine, School of Life Sciences, Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, New York, USA.', 'National Engineering Laboratory for AIDS Vaccine, School of Life Sciences, Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, Michigan, USA.', 'National Engineering Laboratory for AIDS Vaccine, School of Life Sciences, Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, Michigan, USA.', 'Department of Oncology, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, Michigan, USA.', 'Molecular Therapeutics Program, Karmanos Cancer Institute, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, Michigan, USA.', 'Department of Oncology, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, Michigan, USA.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, Michigan, USA.', 'Mucosal Immunology Studies Team, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, The First Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, Michigan, USA.', 'Molecular Therapeutics Program, Karmanos Cancer Institute, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, Michigan, USA.', ""Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Children's Hospital of Michigan, Detroit, Michigan, USA."", 'Cancer Biology Graduate Program, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, Michigan, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, Michigan, USA.', 'Department of Oncology, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, Michigan, USA.', 'Molecular Therapeutics Program, Karmanos Cancer Institute, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, Michigan, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170407,England,Signal Transduct Target Ther,Signal transduction and targeted therapy,101676423,PMC5661618,,,2017/12/22 06:00,2017/12/22 06:01,['2017/12/22 06:00'],"['2017/01/05 00:00 [received]', '2017/02/22 00:00 [revised]', '2017/02/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/12/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/12/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/22 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1038/sigtrans.2017.12 [doi]'],epublish,Signal Transduct Target Ther. 2017 Apr 7;2:17012. doi: 10.1038/sigtrans.2017.12. eCollection 2017.,20210202,,,,,['ORCID: 0000-0001-9892-3118'],,['The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We used the cancer genome atlas exome sequencing (~8000 samples) to compare 22 different cancer phenotypes with more than 6000 controls using a case-control study design and demonstrate that mosaic protein truncating variants in these genes are also associated with solid-tumor cancers. The absence of these cancer-associated mosaic variants from the tumors themselves suggest these are not themselves tumor drivers. Through analysis of different cancer phenotypes we observe gene-specificity for mosaic mutations. We confirm a specific link between PPM1D and ovarian cancer, consistent with previous reports linking PPM1D to breast and ovarian cancer. Additionally, glioblastoma, melanoma and lung cancers show gene specific burdens of mosaic protein truncating mutations. Taken together, these results extend existing observations and broadly link solid-tumor cancers to somatic blood DNA changes.","['Artomov, Mykyta', 'Rivas, Manuel A', 'Genovese, Giulio', 'Daly, Mark J']","['Artomov M', 'Rivas MA', 'Genovese G', 'Daly MJ']","['Broad Institute, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.grid.66859.34', 'Analytic and Translational Genetics Unit, MGH, Boston, MA 02114 USA.0000 0004 0386 9924grid.32224.35', 'Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.000000041936754Xgrid.38142.3c', 'Department of Biomedical Data Science, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.0000000419368956grid.168010.e', 'Broad Institute, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.grid.66859.34', 'Broad Institute, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.grid.66859.34', 'Analytic and Translational Genetics Unit, MGH, Boston, MA 02114 USA.0000 0004 0386 9924grid.32224.35']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20170706,England,NPJ Genom Med,NPJ genomic medicine,101685193,PMC5677955,,,2017/12/22 06:00,2017/12/22 06:01,['2017/12/22 06:00'],"['2016/09/27 00:00 [received]', '2017/05/16 00:00 [revised]', '2017/06/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/12/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/12/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/22 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41525-017-0025-4 [doi]', '25 [pii]']",epublish,NPJ Genom Med. 2017 Jul 6;2:22. doi: 10.1038/s41525-017-0025-4. eCollection 2017.,,,,,,['ORCID: 0000-0003-3066-5575'],,['The authors declare no competing financial interests.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The patient was clinically asymptomatic, and lacked a family history of neuropathy. The effect of the mutation was modelled in a zebrafish knockdown system that recapitulated the symptoms of the patient both prior to and after treatment with vincristine. Confocal microscopy of pre- and post-synaptic markers revealed that the GARS knockdown results in changes to peripheral motor neurons, acetylcholine receptors and their co-localisation in neuromuscular junctions (NMJs), whereas a sensitive and reproducible stimulus-response assay demonstrated that the changes correlating with the GARS mutation in themselves fail to produce peripheral neuropathy symptoms. However, with vincristine treatment the GARS knockdown exacerbates decreased stimulus response and NMJ lesions. We propose that there is substantial benefit in the use of a targeted NGS screen of cancer patients who are to be treated with microtubule targeting agents for deleterious mutations in CMT linked genes, and for the screening in zebrafish of reagents that might inhibit CIPN.","['Holloway, Michael P', 'DeNardo, Bradley D', 'Phornphutkul, Chanika', 'Nguyen, Kevin', 'Davis, Colby', 'Jackson, Cynthia', 'Richendrfer, Holly', 'Creton, Robbert', 'Altura, Rachel A']","['Holloway MP', 'DeNardo BD', 'Phornphutkul C', 'Nguyen K', 'Davis C', 'Jackson C', 'Richendrfer H', 'Creton R', 'Altura RA']","[""Department of Pediatrics, Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Hasbro Children's Hospital and The Warren Alpert Medical School at Brown University, Providence, RI, USA."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Hasbro Children's Hospital and The Warren Alpert Medical School at Brown University, Providence, RI, USA."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Division of Pediatric Endocrinology and Metabolism, Rhode Island Hospital and Brown University, Providence, RI, USA.', ""Department of Pediatrics, Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Hasbro Children's Hospital and The Warren Alpert Medical School at Brown University, Providence, RI, USA."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Hasbro Children's Hospital and The Warren Alpert Medical School at Brown University, Providence, RI, USA."", 'Departments of Pathology and Clinical Molecular Biology, Rhode Island Hospital and Brown University School of Medicine, Providence, RI, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Biology, Cell Biology and Biochemistry, Brown University, Providence, RI, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Biology, Cell Biology and Biochemistry, Brown University, Providence, RI, USA.', ""Department of Pediatrics, Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Hasbro Children's Hospital and The Warren Alpert Medical School at Brown University, Providence, RI, USA.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20160608,England,NPJ Genom Med,NPJ genomic medicine,101685193,PMC5685301,,,2016/06/08 00:00,2016/06/08 00:01,['2017/12/22 06:00'],"['2016/01/27 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/20 00:00 [revised]', '2016/04/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/12/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '2016/06/08 00:01 [medline]']",['10.1038/npjgenmed.2016.16 [doi]'],epublish,NPJ Genom Med. 2016 Jun 8;1:16016. doi: 10.1038/npjgenmed.2016.16. eCollection 2016.,,,,,,,,['The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: All children diagnosed and treated for ALL between 01 January 2003 and 31 December 2013 at our centre were retrospectively reviewed. Logistic regression was used to investigate risk factors for ON occurrence. Results: Of 235 children treated for ALL, 48/235 (20.4%) children suffered musculoskeletal symptoms necessitating radiological investigation. A total of 13 (5.5%) had MRI-diagnosed ON, with a median diagnosis time of 12 months (interquartile range 10 to 14) following initiation of chemotherapy.ON affected 40 joints in 13 children. The most commonly involved joints were hips (14 joints in eight patients) and knees (12 joints in seven patients).Older age at ALL diagnosis was associated with significantly increased risk of development of ON per year (odds ratio 1.35, 95% confidence interval 1.17 to 1.57, p < 0.001).Eight children underwent at least one surgical intervention. Joint arthroplasty was undertaken in nine joints of four children at a mean age of 18.3 years. All patients who underwent hip arthroplasty had previously received core decompression, with a mean time of 27.8 months (18 to 33) between treatments. Conclusions: ON is a significant complication of ALL treatment. Our results suggest risk stratification for development of ON by age, and targeted monitoring of high-risk joints is possible. ON treatment is varied with little evidence base.","['Rhodes, A', 'Gray, J', 'Harvey, N', 'Davies, J H', 'Oreffo, R O C', 'Reading, I', 'Clarke, N M P', 'Aarvold, A']","['Rhodes A', 'Gray J', 'Harvey N', 'Davies JH', 'Oreffo ROC', 'Reading I', 'Clarke NMP', 'Aarvold A']","[""University of Southampton, Tremona Road, Southampton, UK and Southampton Children's Hospital, Tremona Road, Southampton, UK."", ""University of Southampton, Tremona Road, Southampton, UK and Southampton Children's Hospital, Tremona Road, Southampton, UK."", 'MRC Lifecourse Epidemiology Unit, University of Southampton, Tremona Road, Southampton, UK and NIHR Southampton Biomedical Research Centre, Tremona Road, Southampton, UK.', ""University of Southampton, Tremona Road, Southampton, UK and Southampton Children's Hospital, Tremona Road, Southampton, UK."", 'University of Southampton, Tremona Road, Southampton, UK and Bone and Joint Research Group, Centre for Human Development, Stem Cells and Regeneration, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Tremona Road, Southampton, UK.', 'University of Southampton, Tremona Road, Southampton, UK and NIHR Southampton Biomedical Research Centre, Tremona Road, Southampton, UK.', 'University of Southampton, Tremona Road, Southampton, UK.', ""University of Southampton, Tremona Road, Southampton, UK and Southampton Children's Hospital, Tremona Road, Southampton, UK.""]",['eng'],"['MC_U147585827/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', '21231/Arthritis Research UK/United Kingdom', 'MC_U147585819/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', '17702/Arthritis Research UK/United Kingdom', 'MC_UP_A620_1014/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'MC_UU_12011/1/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'HTA/10/33/04/Department of Health/United Kingdom', 'G0400491/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'MC_U147585824/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom']",['Journal Article'],,England,J Child Orthop,Journal of children's orthopaedics,101313582,PMC5725770,['NOTNLM'],"['*acute lymphoblastic leukaemia', '*childhood arthroplasty', '*core decompression', '*corticosteroids', '*osteonecrosis']",2017/12/22 06:00,2017/12/22 06:01,['2017/12/22 06:00'],"['2017/12/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/12/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/22 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1302/1863-2548.11.170142 [doi]', 'jco-11-440 [pii]']",ppublish,J Child Orthop. 2017 Dec 1;11(6):440-447. doi: 10.1302/1863-2548.11.170142.,,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, novel therapies are urgently needed. Repositioning of old drugs is gaining great interest in cancer treatment. Astemizole is an antihistamine proposed to be repositioned for cancer therapy. This drug targets several molecules involved in cancer including histamine receptors, ABC transporters and the potassium channels Eag1 and HERG. Astemizole inhibits the proliferation of different cancer cells including those from cervix, breast, leukemia and liver. Gefitinib is widely used to treat lung cancer; however, no response or drug resistance occurs in many cases. Here, we studied the combined effect of astemizole and gefitinib on the proliferation, survival, apoptosis and gene and protein expression of Eag1 channels in the human lung cancer cell lines A549 and NCI-H1975. Cell proliferation and survival were studied by the MTT method and the colony formation assay, respectively; apoptosis was investigated by flow cytometry. Gene expression was assessed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and protein expression was studied by Western blot analysis and immunocytochemistry. We obtained the inhibitory concentrations 20 and 50 (IC20 and IC50, respectively) values for each drug from the cell proliferation experiments. Drug combination at their IC20 had a superior effect by reducing cell proliferation and survival in up to 80% and 100%, respectively. The drugs alone did not affect apoptosis of H1975 cells, but the drug combination at their IC20 increased apoptosis roughly four times in comparison to the effect of the drugs alone. Eag1 mRNA levels and protein expression were decreased by the drug combination in A549 cells, and astemizole induced subcellular localization changes of the channel protein in these cells. Our in vitro studies strongly suggest that the combination astemizole-gefitinib may be a novel and promising therapy for lung cancer patients.","['Chavez-Lopez, Maria de Guadalupe', 'Zuniga-Garcia, Violeta', 'Hernandez-Gallegos, Elisabeth', 'Vera, Eunice', 'Chasiquiza-Anchatuna, Carmen Alexandra', 'Viteri-Yanez, Marco', 'Sanchez-Ramos, Janet', 'Garrido, Efrain', 'Camacho, Javier']","['Chavez-Lopez MG', 'Zuniga-Garcia V', 'Hernandez-Gallegos E', 'Vera E', 'Chasiquiza-Anchatuna CA', 'Viteri-Yanez M', 'Sanchez-Ramos J', 'Garrido E', 'Camacho J']","['Department of Pharmacology, Center for Research and Advanced Studies of the National Polytechnic Institute, Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Center for Research and Advanced Studies of the National Polytechnic Institute, Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Center for Research and Advanced Studies of the National Polytechnic Institute, Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Center for Research and Advanced Studies of the National Polytechnic Institute, Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Center for Research and Advanced Studies of the National Polytechnic Institute, Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Department of Life Sciences and Agriculture, University of the Armed Forces ESPE, Sangolqui, Ecuador.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Center for Research and Advanced Studies of the National Polytechnic Institute, Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Department of Life Sciences and Agriculture, University of the Armed Forces ESPE, Sangolqui, Ecuador.', 'Department of Genetics and Molecular Biology, Center for Research and Advanced Studies of the National Polytechnic Institute, Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Department of Genetics and Molecular Biology, Center for Research and Advanced Studies of the National Polytechnic Institute, Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Center for Research and Advanced Studies of the National Polytechnic Institute, Mexico City, Mexico.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20171206,New Zealand,Onco Targets Ther,OncoTargets and therapy,101514322,PMC5724417,['NOTNLM'],"['astemizole', 'gefitinib', 'lung cancer', 'potassium channels']",2017/12/22 06:00,2017/12/22 06:01,['2017/12/22 06:00'],"['2017/12/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/12/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/22 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/OTT.S144506 [doi]', 'ott-10-5795 [pii]']",epublish,Onco Targets Ther. 2017 Dec 6;10:5795-5803. doi: 10.2147/OTT.S144506. eCollection 2017.,,,,,,,,"['Disclosure CAC-A and MV-Y received financial support for undergraduate studies', 'from Universidad de las Fuerzas Armadas, ESPE, Ecuador.

METHODS: The clinical and biological cha-racteristics of 33 AML patients with EVI1 positive were retrospectively analyzed in 361 AML patients who were diagnosed and treated in our institute from March 2015 to July 2016, and the clinical and biological features, and rates of the induced remission were compared between the intermediate risk and poor risk with EVI1 positive AML, moreover, the influential factors on complete remission (CR) were analyzed. The expression of EVI1/ABL was tested in 32 healthy donors to confirm the abnormal threshold of EVI1 expression. RESULTS: The definition of EVI1 positive was that the quantitative expression of EVI1/ABL was more than 8.0%. The 33 AML patients with EVI1 positive were found in 361 newly diagnosed AML patients, in which the female and male patients were 17 and 16 respectively, the median age was 45 (18-67) years, with a median follow-up of 6.6 (0.7-13.2) months. Intermediate karyotype was found in 17 patients(including 9 patients with normal karyotypes,1 patient with +8);unfavorable karyotype was found in 14 patients [including 7 patients with -7/7q(-),4 patients with t (v;11q23),3 patients with inv(3)/t(3;3), and 2 patients without mitotic figures]. The rate of CR in the first induction chemotherapy was 42.4%, and the rate of total CR was 60.6%. According to the NCCN, 16 intermediate risk patients and poor risk patients were divided, without favorable risk patients. The rate of CR in the first induction chemotherapy were 68.8% and 17.6% (P=0.005) in the intermediate risk and poor risk respectively, that of total CR were 81.3% and 41.2%(P=0.032), and the rates of relapse were 7.7% and 14.3%.Univariable analysis revealed that unfavorable karyotype could affect the rate of CR in the first reduction chemotherapy and that of total CR (P=0.004, 0.029). The poor risk patients had higher mortality (41.2% vs. 6.3%, P=0.039) and lower overall survival (OS)(P=0.012). CONCLUSION: EVI1 may be not an independent prognostic factor for the AML patients considering the appea-rance in the intermediate and poor risk patients. It predicts poor outcome in the EVI1 positive AML patients who have unfavorable karyocytes, such as -7/7q(-), t(v;11q23), and inv(3)/t(3;3), and also a low rate of both CR in the first induction chemotherapy and total CR. It also has a low rate of long-term survival and high mortality in the AML patients with EVI1 positive, who may benefit from allogeneic bone marrow transplantation as soon as possible.","['Duan, W B', 'Gong, L Z', 'Jia, J S', 'Zhu, H H', 'Zhao, X S', 'Jiang, Q', 'Zhao, T', 'Wang, J', 'Qin, Y Z', 'Huang, X J', 'Jiang, H']","['Duan WB', 'Gong LZ', 'Jia JS', 'Zhu HH', 'Zhao XS', 'Jiang Q', 'Zhao T', 'Wang J', 'Qin YZ', 'Huang XJ', 'Jiang H']","[""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing 100044, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing 100044, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing 100044, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing 100044, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing 100044, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing 100044, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing 100044, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing 100044, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing 100044, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing 100044, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing 100044, China.""]",['chi'],,['Journal Article'],,China,Beijing Da Xue Xue Bao Yi Xue Ban,Beijing da xue xue bao.

The mechanisms of anemia in MDS are unclear. Using a mouse genetic approach, here we show that dual deficiency of mDia1 and miR-146a, encoded on chromosome 5q and commonly deleted in MDS (del(5q) MDS), causes an age-related anemia and ineffective erythropoiesis mimicking human MDS. We demonstrate that the ageing bone marrow microenvironment is important for the development of ineffective erythropoiesis in these mice. Damage-associated molecular pattern molecules (DAMPs), whose levels increase in ageing bone marrow, induced TNFalpha and IL-6 upregulation in myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in mDia1/miR-146a double knockout mice. Mechanistically, we reveal that pathologic levels of TNFalpha and IL-6 inhibit erythroid colony formation and differentially affect terminal erythropoiesis through reactive oxygen species-induced caspase-3 activation and apoptosis. Treatment of the mDia1/miR-146a double knockout mice with all-trans retinoic acid, which promoted the differentiation of MDSCs and ameliorated the inflammatory bone marrow microenvironment, significantly rescued anemia and ineffective erythropoiesis. Our study underscores the dual roles of the ageing microenvironment and genetic abnormalities in the pathogenesis of ineffective erythropoiesis in del(5q) MDS.","['Mei, Y', 'Zhao, B', 'Basiorka, A A', 'Yang, J', 'Cao, L', 'Zhang, J', 'List, A', 'Ji, P']","['Mei Y', 'Zhao B', 'Basiorka AA', 'Yang J', 'Cao L', 'Zhang J', 'List A', 'Ji P']","['Department of Pathology, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Cancer Biology PhD Program, H.

Patients received wKCyd for up to nine 28-day cycles, followed by maintenance with carfilzomib until progression/intolerance. The phase 1 portion used a 3+3 dose-escalation scheme to determine the maximum tolerated dose of weekly carfilzomib: 12 patients received wKCyd with carfilzomib doses of 45, 56 and 70 mg/m(2). The recommended phase 2 dose was established at 70 mg/m(2) and 54 patients (phase 1 and 2) received weekly carfilzomib 70 mg/m(2): 85% of them achieved partial response (PR), 66% very good PR, 30%near-complete response (CR) and 15% CR. Responses improved in 40 patients who started maintenance: 98% achieved PR, including 29% CR and 10% stringent CR.

We hypothesized that new drug classes and combinations employed prior to AHCT as well as after post-AHCT relapse may have changed the natural history of MM in this population. We analyzed the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research database to track overall survival (OS) of MM patients receiving single AHCT within 12 months after diagnosis (N=3256) and relapsing early post-AHCT (<24 months), and to identify factors predicting for early vs late relapses (24-48 months post-AHCT). Over three periods (2001-2004, 2005-2008, 2009-2013), patient characteristics were balanced except for lower proportion of Stage III, higher likelihood of one induction therapy with novel triplets and higher rates of planned post-AHCT maintenance over time. The proportion of patients relapsing early was stable over time at 35-38%. Factors reducing risk of early relapse included lower stage, chemosensitivity, transplant after 2008 and post-AHCT maintenance. Shorter post-relapse OS was associated with early relapse, IgA MM, Karnofsky <90, stage III, >1 line of induction and lack of maintenance. Post-AHCT early relapse remains a poor prognostic factor, even though outcomes have improved over time.","['Kumar, S K', 'Dispenzieri, A', 'Fraser, R', 'Mingwei, F', 'Akpek, G', 'Cornell, R', 'Kharfan-Dabaja, M', 'Freytes, C', 'Hashmi, S', 'Hildebrandt, G', 'Holmberg, L', 'Kyle, R', 'Lazarus, H', 'Lee, C', 'Mikhael, J', 'Nishihori, T', 'Tay, J', 'Usmani, S', 'Vesole, D', 'Vij, R', 'Wirk, B', 'Krishnan, A', 'Gasparetto, C', 'Mark, T', 'Nieto, Y', 'Hari, P', ""D'Souza, A""]","['Kumar SK', 'Dispenzieri A', 'Fraser R', 'Mingwei F', 'Akpek G', 'Cornell R', 'Kharfan-Dabaja M', 'Freytes C', 'Hashmi S', 'Hildebrandt G', 'Holmberg L', 'Kyle R', 'Lazarus H', 'Lee C', 'Mikhael J', 'Nishihori T', 'Tay J', 'Usmani S', 'Vesole D', 'Vij R', 'Wirk B', 'Krishnan A', 'Gasparetto C', 'Mark T', 'Nieto Y', 'Hari P', ""D'Souza A""]","['Mayo Clinic Rochester, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Mayo Clinic Rochester, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'CIBMTR (Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research), Department of Medicine, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI, USA.', 'CIBMTR (Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research), Department of Medicine, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Rush University, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA.', 'Department of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, H.

One isoform, beta-arrestin2 (betaarr2), has been implicated in initiation and progression of chronic myeloid leukemia, another myeloproliferative neoplasm closely related to primary myelofibrosis. Accordingly, we investigated the relationship between betaarr2 and primary myelofibrosis. In a murine model of MPLW515L-mutant primary myelofibrosis, mice transplanted with donor betaarr2-knockout (betaarr2-/-) hematopoietic stem cells infected with MPL-mutant retrovirus did not develop myelofibrosis, whereas controls uniformly succumbed to disease. Although transplanted betaarr2-/- cells homed properly to marrow, they did not repopulate long-term due to increased apoptosis and decreased self-renewal of betaarr2-/- cells. In order to assess the effect of acute loss of betaarr2 in established primary myelofibrosis in vivo, we utilized a tamoxifen-induced Cre-conditional betaarr2-knockout mouse. Mice that received Cre (+) donor cells and developed myelofibrosis had significantly improved survival compared with controls. These data indicate that lack of antiapoptotic betaarr2 mediates marrow failure of murine hematopoietic stem cells overexpressing MPLW515L. They also indicate that betaarr2 is necessary for progression of primary myelofibrosis, suggesting that it may serve as a novel therapeutic target in this disease.","['Rein, Lindsay Am', 'Wisler, James W', 'Kim, Jihee', 'Theriot, Barbara', 'Huang, LiYin', 'Price, Trevor', 'Yang, Haeyoon', 'Chen, Minyong', 'Chen, Wei', 'Sipkins, Dorothy', 'Fedoriw, Yuri', 'Walker, Julia Kl', 'Premont, Richard T', 'Lefkowitz, Robert J']","['Rein LA', 'Wisler JW', 'Kim J', 'Theriot B', 'Huang L', 'Price T', 'Yang H', 'Chen M', 'Chen W', 'Sipkins D', 'Fedoriw Y', 'Walker JK', 'Premont RT', 'Lefkowitz RJ']","['Division of Hematologic Malignancies and Cellular Therapy.', 'Division of Cardiology.', 'Department of Medicine, and.', 'Department of Medicine, and.', 'Department of Medicine, and.', 'Division of Hematologic Malignancies and Cellular Therapy.', 'Division of Hematologic Malignancies and Cellular Therapy.', 'Division of Gastroenterology, Duke University, Durham, North Carolina, USA.', 'Division of Gastroenterology, Duke University, Durham, North Carolina, USA.', 'Division of Hematologic Malignancies and Cellular Therapy.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA.', 'Duke University School of Nursing and.', 'Division of Gastroenterology, Duke University, Durham, North Carolina, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Department of Biochemistry, and Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Duke University, Durham, North Carolina, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA172570/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL016037/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 HL007057/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20171221,United States,JCI Insight,JCI insight,101676073,PMC5752278,['NOTNLM'],"['*Apoptosis', '*Hematology', '*Hematopoietic stem cells', '*Leukemias', '*Oncology']",2017/12/22 06:00,2019/07/10 06:00,['2017/12/22 06:00'],"['2017/10/18 00:00 [received]', '2017/11/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/12/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/12/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/10 06:00 [medline]']","['98094 [pii]', '10.1172/jci.insight.98094 [doi]']",epublish,JCI Insight. 2017 Dec 21;2(24). pii: 98094. doi: 10.1172/jci.insight.98094.,20190708,24,"['0 (Arrb2 protein, mouse)', '0 (beta-Arrestin 2)', '094ZI81Y45 (Tamoxifen)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/physiology', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cell Proliferation/physiology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Disease Progression', 'Graft Survival/physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/methods', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/chemically induced/*metabolism/pathology', 'Tamoxifen', 'beta-Arrestin 2/deficiency/genetics/*physiology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These ALV subgroups use diverse cellular proteins encoded by four genetic loci in chickens as receptors to gain entry into host cells. Hosts exposed to ALVs might be under selective pressure to develop resistance to ALV infection. Indeed, resistance alleles have previously been identified in all four receptor loci in chickens. The tvb gene encodes a receptor, which determines the susceptibility of host cells to ALV subgroup B (ALV-B), ALV-D, and ALV-E. Here we describe the identification of two novel alleles of the tvb receptor gene, which possess independent insertions each within exon 4. The insertions resulted in frameshift mutations that reveal a premature stop codon that causes nonsense-mediated decay of the mutant mRNA and the production of truncated Tvb protein. As a result, we observed that the frameshift mutations in the tvb gene significantly lower the binding affinity of the truncated Tvb receptors for the ALV-B, ALV-D, and ALV-E envelope glycoproteins and significantly reduce susceptibility to infection by ALV-B, ALV-D and ALV-E in vitro and in vivo Taken together, these findings suggest that frameshift mutation can be a molecular mechanism of reducing susceptibility to ALV and enhance our understanding of virus-host coevolution.IMPORTANCE Avian leukosis virus (ALV) once caused devastating economic loss to the U.S. poultry industry prior the current eradication schemes in place, and it continues to cause severe calamity to the poultry industry in China and Southeast Asia, where deployment of a complete eradication scheme remains a challenge. The tvb gene encodes the cellular receptor necessary for subgroup B, D, and E ALV infection. Two tvb allelic variants that resulted from frameshift mutations have been identified in this study, which have been shown to have significantly reduced functionality in mediating subgroup B, D, and E ALV infection. Unlike the control of herpesvirus-induced diseases by vaccination, the control of avian leukosis in chickens has relied totally on virus eradication measures and host genetic resistance. This finding enriches the allelic pool of the tvb gene and expands the potential for genetic improvement of ALV resistance in varied chicken populations by selection.","['Li, Xinjian', 'Chen, Weiguo', 'Zhang, Huanmin', 'Li, Aijun', 'Shu, Dingming', 'Li, Hongxing', 'Dai, Zhenkai', 'Yan, Yiming', 'Zhang, Xinheng', 'Lin, Wencheng', 'Ma, Jingyun', 'Xie, Qingmei']","['Li X', 'Chen W', 'Zhang H', 'Li A', 'Shu D', 'Li H', 'Dai Z', 'Yan Y', 'Zhang X', 'Lin W', 'Ma J', 'Xie Q']","[""College of Animal Science, South China Agricultural University and Guangdong Provincial Key Lab of Agro-Animal Genomics and Molecular Breeding, Guangzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Key Laboratory of Animal Health Aquaculture and Environmental Control, Guangdong, Guangzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""College of Animal Science, South China Agricultural University and Guangdong Provincial Key Lab of Agro-Animal Genomics and Molecular Breeding, Guangzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Key Laboratory of Animal Health Aquaculture and Environmental Control, Guangdong, Guangzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""South China Collaborative Innovation Center for Poultry Disease Control and Product Safety, Guangzhou, People's Republic of China."", 'USDA, Agriculture Research Service, Avian Disease and Oncology Laboratory, East Lansing, Michigan, USA.', ""College of Science and Engineering, Jinan University, Guangzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Institute of Animal Science, Guangdong Academy of Agriculture Sciences, Guangzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""College of Animal Science, South China Agricultural University and Guangdong Provincial Key Lab of Agro-Animal Genomics and Molecular Breeding, Guangzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Key Laboratory of Animal Health Aquaculture and Environmental Control, Guangdong, Guangzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""College of Animal Science, South China Agricultural University and Guangdong Provincial Key Lab of Agro-Animal Genomics and Molecular Breeding, Guangzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Key Laboratory of Animal Health Aquaculture and Environmental Control, Guangdong, Guangzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""College of Animal Science, South China Agricultural University and Guangdong Provincial Key Lab of Agro-Animal Genomics and Molecular Breeding, Guangzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Key Laboratory of Animal Health Aquaculture and Environmental Control, Guangdong, Guangzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""College of Animal Science, South China Agricultural University and Guangdong Provincial Key Lab of Agro-Animal Genomics and Molecular Breeding, Guangzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Key Laboratory of Animal Health Aquaculture and Environmental Control, Guangdong, Guangzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""College of Animal Science, South China Agricultural University and Guangdong Provincial Key Lab of Agro-Animal Genomics and Molecular Breeding, Guangzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Key Laboratory of Animal Health Aquaculture and Environmental Control, Guangdong, Guangzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""South China Collaborative Innovation Center for Poultry Disease Control and Product Safety, Guangzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""College of Animal Science, South China Agricultural University and Guangdong Provincial Key Lab of Agro-Animal Genomics and Molecular Breeding, Guangzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Key Laboratory of Animal Health Aquaculture and Environmental Control, Guangdong, Guangzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""South China Collaborative Innovation Center for Poultry Disease Control and Product Safety, Guangzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""College of Animal Science, South China Agricultural University and Guangdong Provincial Key Lab of Agro-Animal Genomics and Molecular Breeding, Guangzhou, People's Republic of China qmx@scau.edu.cn."", ""Key Laboratory of Animal Health Aquaculture and Environmental Control, Guangdong, Guangzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""South China Collaborative Innovation Center for Poultry Disease Control and Product Safety, Guangzhou, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180328,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,PMC5874434,['NOTNLM'],"['*avian leukosis virus', '*chicken', '*frameshift mutations', '*genetic resistance', '*receptor binding affinity', '*tvb receptor gene']",2017/12/22 06:00,2018/04/19 06:00,['2017/12/22 06:00'],"['2017/10/10 00:00 [received]', '2017/12/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/12/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/04/19 06:00 [medline]', '2017/12/22 06:00 [entrez]']","['JVI.01770-17 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.01770-17 [doi]']",epublish,J Virol. 2018 Mar 28;92(8). pii: JVI.01770-17. doi: 10.1128/JVI.01770-17.

Nintedanib has received regulatory approval as second-line treatment of adenocarcinoma non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), in combination with docetaxel. In addition, nintedanib has been approved for the treatment of idiopathic lung fibrosis. Here we report the results from a broad kinase screen that identified additional kinases as targets for nintedanib in the low nanomolar range. Several of these kinases are known to be mutated or overexpressed and are involved in tumor development (discoidin domain receptor family, member 1 and 2, tropomyosin receptor kinase A (TRKA) and C, rearranged during transfection proto-oncogene [RET proto oncogene]), as well as in fibrotic diseases (e.g., DDRs). In tumor cell lines displaying molecular alterations in potential nintedanib targets, the inhibitor demonstrates direct antiproliferative effects: in the NSCLC cell line NCI-H1703 carrying a PDGFRalpha amplification (ampl.); the gastric cancer cell line KatoIII and the breast cancer cell line MFM223, both driven by a FGFR2 amplification; AN3CA (endometrial carcinoma) bearing a mutated FGFR2; the acute myeloid leukemia cell lines MOLM-13 and MV-4-11-B with FLT3 mutations; and the NSCLC adenocarcinoma LC-2/ad harboring a CCDC6-RET fusion. Potent kinase inhibition does not, however, strictly translate into antiproliferative activity, as demonstrated in the TRKA-dependent cell lines CUTO-3 and KM-12. Importantly, nintedanib treatment of NCI-H1703 tumor xenografts triggered effective tumor shrinkage, indicating a direct effect on the tumor cells in addition to the antiangiogenic effect on the tumor stroma. These findings will be instructive in guiding future genome-based clinical trials of nintedanib.","['Hilberg, Frank', 'Tontsch-Grunt, Ulrike', 'Baum, Anke', 'Le, Anh T', 'Doebele, Robert C', 'Lieb, Simone', 'Gianni, Davide', 'Voss, Tilman', 'Garin-Chesa, Pilar', 'Haslinger, Christian', 'Kraut, Norbert']","['Hilberg F', 'Tontsch-Grunt U', 'Baum A', 'Le AT', 'Doebele RC', 'Lieb S', 'Gianni D', 'Voss T', 'Garin-Chesa P', 'Haslinger C', 'Kraut N']","['Boehringer Ingelheim RCV GmbH Co KG, Vienna, Austria (F.H., U.T.-G., A.B., S.L., D.G., T.V., P.G.-C., C.H., N.K.);

The interaction between Ig-like transcript 3 (ILT3), a marker of tolerogenic dendritic cells, also known as LILRB4/LIR5/CD85k, and its still unidentified ligand on the surface of activated human T cells is potentially important for immune checkpoint blockade. To identify the ILT3 ligand, we generated mAb by immunizing mice with Jurkat acute T cell leukemia, which binds ILT3.Fc to its membrane. Flow cytometry, mass spectrometry, and Biacore studies demonstrated that the ILT3 ligand is a CD166/activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule. Knockdown of CD166 in primary human T cells by nucleofection abolished the capacity of ILT3.Fc to inhibit CD4(+) Th cell proliferation and to induce the generation of CD8(+)CD28(-) T suppressor cells. CD166 displays strong heterophilic interaction with CD6 and weaker homophilic CD166-CD166 cell adhesion interaction. ILT3.Fc inhibited the growth of CD166(+) tumor cell lines (TCL) derived from lymphoid malignancies in vitro and in vivo. CRISPR-Cas9-based knockout of CD166 from TCL abrogated ILT3.Fc binding and its tumor-inhibitory effect. The mechanism underlying the effect of ILT3.Fc on tumor cell growth involves inhibition of the p70S6K signaling pathway. Blockade of CD166 by ILT3.Fc inhibited progression of human TCL in NOD.Cg-Prkdc Il-2rg/SzJ mice, suggesting its potential immunotherapeutic value.","['Xu, Zheng', 'Chang, Chih-Chao', 'Li, Muyang', 'Zhang, Qing-Yin', 'Vasilescu, Elena-Rodica M', ""D'Agati, Vivette"", 'Floratos, Aristidis', 'Vlad, George', 'Suciu-Foca, Nicole']","['Xu Z', 'Chang CC', 'Li M', 'Zhang QY', 'Vasilescu EM', ""D'Agati V"", 'Floratos A', 'Vlad G', 'Suciu-Foca N']","['Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032; and zx2142@columbia.edu.', 'Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032; and.', 'Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032; and.', 'Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032; and.', 'Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032; and.', 'Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032; and.', 'Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032.', 'Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032; and.', 'Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032; and.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20171220,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,,,,2017/12/22 06:00,2018/10/03 06:00,['2017/12/22 06:00'],"['2017/04/19 00:00 [received]', '2017/11/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/12/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/03 06:00 [medline]', '2017/12/22 06:00 [entrez]']","['jimmunol.1700553 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1700553 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2018 Feb 1;200(3):1207-1219. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1700553.

The response of EF4.1 mice to an I-Ab-associated epitope of the F-MuLV envelope protein is dominated by clones expressing a Valpha2 gene segment, thus allowing a comprehensive analysis of the TCRalpha repertoire in a relatively large cohort of mice. Control and Treg-depleted EF4.1 mice were immunized, and the extent of the Valpha2-bearing, antigen-specific TCR repertoire was characterized by high-throughput sequencing and spectratyping analysis. In addition to increased clonal expansion and acquisition of effector functions, Treg depletion led to the expression of a more diverse TCR repertoire comprising several private clonotypes rarely observed in control mice or in the pre-immune repertoire. Injection of anti-CD86 antibodies in vivo led to a strong reduction in TCR diversity, suggesting that Tregs may influence TCR repertoire diversity by modulating costimulatory molecule availability. Collectively, these studies illustrate an additional mechanism whereby Tregs control the immune response to non-self-antigens.","['Fontaine, Martina', 'Vogel, Isabel', 'Van Eycke, Yves-Remi', 'Galuppo, Adrien', 'Ajouaou, Yousra', 'Decaestecker, Christine', 'Kassiotis, George', 'Moser, Muriel', 'Leo, Oberdan']","['Fontaine M', 'Vogel I', 'Van Eycke YR', 'Galuppo A', 'Ajouaou Y', 'Decaestecker C', 'Kassiotis G', 'Moser M', 'Leo O']","[""Laboratoire d'Immunobiologie, Universite Libre de Bruxelles (ULB), Gosselies, Belgium."", ""Laboratoire d'Immunobiologie, Universite Libre de Bruxelles (ULB), Gosselies, Belgium."", 'DIAPath, Center for Microscopy and Molecular Imaging, Universite Libre de Bruxelles (ULB), Gosselies, Belgium.', 'Laboratories of Image, Signal processing & Acoustics Universite Libre de Bruxelles (ULB), Brussels, Belgium.', ""Laboratoire d'Immunobiologie, Universite Libre de Bruxelles (ULB), Gosselies, Belgium."", ""Laboratoire d'Immunobiologie, Universite Libre de Bruxelles (ULB), Gosselies, Belgium."", 'DIAPath, Center for Microscopy and Molecular Imaging, Universite Libre de Bruxelles (ULB), Gosselies, Belgium.', 'Laboratories of Image, Signal processing & Acoustics Universite Libre de Bruxelles (ULB), Brussels, Belgium.', 'Retroviral Immunology, The Francis Crick Institute, London, UK.', 'Department of Medicine Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London London, UK.', ""Laboratoire d'Immunobiologie, Universite Libre de Bruxelles (ULB), Gosselies, Belgium."", ""Laboratoire d'Immunobiologie, Universite Libre de Bruxelles (ULB), Gosselies, Belgium oleo@ulb.ac.be.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20171220,England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,PMC5793804,['NOTNLM'],"['*CD4+ T-cell lymphocytes', '*TCR repertoire analysis', '*regulatory T cells']",2017/12/22 06:00,2018/10/12 06:00,['2017/12/22 06:00'],"['2017/03/06 00:00 [received]', '2017/11/17 00:00 [revised]', '2017/11/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/12/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/12 06:00 [medline]', '2017/12/22 06:00 [entrez]']","['embj.201796881 [pii]', '10.15252/embj.201796881 [doi]']",ppublish,EMBO J. 2018 Feb 1;37(3):398-412. doi: 10.15252/embj.201796881.

We are thus exploring the association of HHEX and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). METHODS: The study included 56 AML patients and 12 normal bone marrows (NBMs). Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR) was used to assess HHEX expression. The functional consequences of this gene were explored in the Kasumi-1 cell-line following dampened expression of HHEX. This was done by transfecting small interfering RNA (siRNA). RESULTS: Expression levels of HHEX in AML were similar to that found in controls (0.094+/-0.103 vs. 0.078+/-0.112; p=0.203), but AML with t(8;21) was more prevalent than other types of AMLs (p<0.01) or controls (p<0.05). Expression levels of HHEX in AML (non-M3) did not significantly affect overall survival (p=0.555). In vitro studies carried out in Kasumi-1 cells suggest that after decreasing HHEX, cell viability at 48 and 72 h were significantly reduced compared to controls (p<0.05). The apoptotic rate was also significantly increased at 48 and 72 h compared to controls (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: HHEX is expressed in multiple types of AML, with the highest levels seen in t(8;21) AML. HHEX was essential for Kasumi-1 cell proliferation and may represent a potential therapeutic target enabling against AML.","['Zhang, Shuangfeng', 'Ma, Liang', 'Chen, Yafeng', 'Xu, Huan', 'Chen, Suning', 'Wu, Wenzhong']","['Zhang S', 'Ma L', 'Chen Y', 'Xu H', 'Chen S', 'Wu W']","[""Department of Hematology, The People's Hospital of Yixing, Jiangsu, P.R.

Compared with BCR-ABL positive patients, BCR-ABL negative patients showed a lower CIR (P<0.001), a higher NRM (P=0.030) and a similar OS (41.6% versus 48.9%, P=0.497). Multivariate analysis showed that BCR-ABL positive (P=0.016) and a disease statusphase >/=CR2 (P<0.001) before HSCT were independent risk factors for LFS, while the age underwent HSCT was the principal element affecting prognosis (P<0.001). CONCLUSION: Both the relapse and infection are the main causes of death in the patients after transplantation. A disease status >/=CR2 and the BCR-ABL positive before transplantation are 2 independent risk factors of LFS in the patients with Ph(+) ALL after allo-HSCT.","['Bao, Xie-Bing', 'Cai, Wen-Zhi', 'He, Xue-Feng', 'Chen, Su-Ning', 'Qiu, Hui-Ying', 'Sun, Ai-Ning', 'Wu, De-Pei']","['Bao XB', 'Cai WZ', 'He XF', 'Chen SN', 'Qiu HY', 'Sun AN', 'Wu DP']","['Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Hemostasis of Ministry of Health, Jiangsu Collaborate Innovation Center of Hematology, Suzhou 215006, Jiangsu Province, China.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Hemostasis of Ministry of Health, Jiangsu Collaborate Innovation Center of Hematology, Suzhou 215006, Jiangsu Province, China.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Hemostasis of Ministry of Health, Jiangsu Collaborate Innovation Center of Hematology, Suzhou 215006, Jiangsu Province, China.

METHODS: The base-line ATP value in CD4(+) T lymphocytes in cases of hematological malignancies and the ATP level in CD4(+) T lymphocytes of acute leukemia patients before allo-HSCT were detected. Allo-HSCT recipients were devided into 3 groups with different level of immunereactivity according to ATP concentraiton in month 3 (day 90+/-5) after allo-HSCT. The clinical characteristics of patients in 3 groups were analyzed. RESULTS: The mass concentration of Immuknow ATP in 15 cases of hematological malignancies before allo-HSCT ranged from 56.21-435.71 ng/ml, with a mean of 203.98+/-112.72 ng/ml. The ATP level in 46 cases after allo-HSCT ranged from 1.69-333.09 ng/ml, with a median of 41.96 ng/ml. Both 91.26 ng/ml (mean-SD) and 316.70 ng/ml (mean+SD) were used as cutoff, and 36 allo-HSCT recipients (78.3%) were assigned to low immunereactivity group, 8 recipients (17.4%) to middle group and 2 recipients (4.3%) to high group. The incidence of infection in low immunereactivity group was significantly higher than that in middle immunereactivity group (86.1% vs 50.0%)(P=0.022), and also significantly higher than that in high immunereactivity group (86.1% vs 0%)(P=0.002). There were no statistical differences in the incidences of severe infection among 3 groups. The incidence of grade II or higher acute graft versus host disease (aGVHD) in high immunereactivity group was superior to that in low immunereactivity group statistically (100% vs 13.9%)(P=0.002). Immune-mediated organ injury occurred more frequently in high immunereactivity group as compared with low and middle immunereactivity groups (100% vs 0% and vs 0%)(P=0.000; P=0.002). There were no significant differences in relapse rates of leukemia among 3 groups. The percentage of patients with increased trough blood concentration of cyclosporine A(CsA) was not significantly different among 3 groups (P=0.720). CONCLUSION: Detection of ATP level in CD4(+) T lymphocytes on early stage after allo-HSCT possesses clinical significance for predicting infection, severity at aGVHD and immune-mediated organ injury.","['Li, Li', 'Liu, Yi', 'Liu, Jia-Xin', 'Zhao, De-Feng', 'Zheng, Pei-Hao', 'Yin, Wen-Jie', 'Ma, Yuan-Yuan', 'Qian, Li-Ren', 'Wang, Heng-Xiang', 'Gao, Chun-Ji', 'Shen, Jian-Liang']","['Li L', 'Liu Y', 'Liu JX', 'Zhao DF', 'Zheng PH', 'Yin WJ', 'Ma YY', 'Qian LR', 'Wang HX', 'Gao CJ', 'Shen JL']","['Department of Hematology, Navy General Hospital, Beijing 100048, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Navy General Hospital, Beijing 100048, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Navy General Hospital, Beijing 100048, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Navy General Hospital, Beijing 100048, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Navy General Hospital, Beijing 100048, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Navy General Hospital, Beijing 100048, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Navy General Hospital, Beijing 100048, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Navy General Hospital, Beijing 100048, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Air Force General Hospital, Beijing 100142, China.', 'Department of Hematology, PLA General Hospital, Beijing 100853, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Navy General Hospital, Beijing 100048, China.

METHODS: A tatol of 266 patients were diagnosed as ALL from January 1, 2010 to May 31, 2016. The clinical data of 12 cases of patients with DVT were retrospectively analyzed, 183 cases diagnosed before January 1, 2015 were received chemotherapy with the scheme of SCMC-05. The other cases were treated by the scheme of CCCG. All the patients received central venous catheter. RESULTS: The DVT happened in 12 cases including 10 cases of limb DVT and 2 cases of intacranial venous sinus thrombosis. The DVT mostly occured in intermediate risk ALL patients, the infection and coagulopathy existed in most patients. They were treated with low molecular heparin(LWHP), among them 5 cases were given extubation; the thrombus disappeared in 6 cases after 1 week; the intracranial venous sinus thrombosis in 1 case did not obviously improved after 6 months of treatment. The ALL children with DVT were treated with LWHP when using L-ASP, as a result no thrombuses happened. CONCLUSION: Centralvenous catheter and chemotherapeutic drugs were the major cause of DVT. Abnormal coagulation, infection, and risk stratification are another risk factors for thrombosis. ALL children thrombosis are benefited from LWHP prevention when using L-ASP again.","['Chu, Jin-Hua', 'Liu, Kang-Kang', 'Wang, Ning-Ling', 'Yang, Lin-Hai', 'Xie, Zhi-Wei', 'Zhang, Kun-Long', 'Tu, Song-Ji']","['Chu JH', 'Liu KK', 'Wang NL', 'Yang LH', 'Xie ZW', 'Zhang KL', 'Tu SJ']","['Department of Pediatrics, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University, Hefei 230601, Anhui Province, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University, Hefei 230601, Anhui Province, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University, Hefei 230601, Anhui Province, China.

METHODS: A total of 100 cases of AL in our hospital from Jan. 2013 to Sep. 2016 were enrolled in the study. The mRNA expression of BCL-2 and PD-L1 in peripheral blood of patients was detected by RT-PCR, and the prognosis of the patients was followed up. According to the follow-up results, these patients were divided into complete remission group and no remission group, the statistical analysis of different indexes predicting the prognosis was performed. RESULTS: Compared with the healthy control group, the positive rates of BCL-2 and PD-L1 in the bone marrow specimens of AL patients significantly increased (P<0.01). The BCL-2 predicting the prognosis of patients showed that the area under the curve (AUC) was 0.725(P=0.006), the diagnostic threshold was 1.550, the sensitivity(Sen) and specificity(Spe) were 72% and 84%, respectively.

METHODS: The specimens were collected from primary AML (68 cases) and MDS (57 cases) patients from August 2015 to June 2016 in the Harbin Institute of Hematology and Oncology. The mutations of 22 related genes were detected by using AML/MDS-NGS chips. RESULTS: TET2 gene showed the highest mutation rate in AML (55.9%) and MDS (56.1%). The gene mutations were as follows: CEBPA (11.8%), DNMT3A (7.4%), C-KIT (7.4%) and FLT3-ITD (7.4%) in AML, and U2AF1 (10.5%) and SRSF2 (10.5%) in MDS. All the genes had specific mutation sites except TP53 and CEBPA. The mutations of FLT3, C-KIT and CEBPA became negative in the 5 AML patients in remission when compared with those at primary attack, but the mutation rate of TET2 gene was not obviously changed, whereas the mutation rate of the 5 MDS patients was not significantly changed. The new gene mutations appeared in 3 MDS patients with disease progression, but the mutation rate was not changed significantly in the disease progression.

METHODS: The clinical data of 214 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia admitted in our hospital from March 2014 to February 2017 was retrospectively analyzed. Among them 65 patients had invasive fungal infection (IFI) during the chemotherapy period, out of them 35 patients treated with voriconazole were enrolled in group A; anather 30 patients treated with amphotericin B were enrolled in group B. The clinical factors that affected the incidence of IFI was statistically analyzed. And the efficacy and adverse reactions in children with ALL were compared after treatment for 8 weeks. RESULTS: The incidence of IFI in children with ALL in this study was 30.37%, and was related with the duration of hospitalization and the level of neutrophil deficiency (P<0.05). The total effective rates of group A and group B were 72.28% and 43.33%, respectively, their difference was statistically significant between 2 group (P<0.05). The incidence of renal function impairment, digestive dysfunction and neurotoxicity were 8.57%, 5.71% and 5.71% in children with ALL treated with voriconazole respectively, which were lower than those in children treated with amphotericin B (P<0.05). The score index of Physical health, energy state, emotion control and overall health in group A were significantly higher than those in B group, and the difference was statistically significant (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: The occurrence of IFI in children with ALL relats with the time of hospitalization and the level of neutrophils. The clinical effect of voriconazole is better, and the incidence of adverse reactions can be reduced, suggesting important clinical significance.","['Yi, Xue-Lan', 'Mao, Qing', 'Jiang, Yan', 'Guo, Xiu-Bing', 'Chen, Yan']","['Yi XL', 'Mao Q', 'Jiang Y', 'Guo XB', 'Chen Y']","[""The Second Department of Pediatrics, The Affiliated Hospital of Zunyi Medical College, Guizhou Children's Hospital, Zunyi 563000, Guizhou Province, China."", ""The Second Department of Pediatrics, The Affiliated Hospital of Zunyi Medical College, Guizhou Children's Hospital, Zunyi 563000, Guizhou Province, China."", ""The Second Department of Pediatrics, The Affiliated Hospital of Zunyi Medical College, Guizhou Children's Hospital, Zunyi 563000, Guizhou Province, China."", ""The Second Department of Pediatrics, The Affiliated Hospital of Zunyi Medical College, Guizhou Children's Hospital, Zunyi 563000, Guizhou Province, China."", ""The Second Department of Pediatrics, The Affiliated Hospital of Zunyi Medical College, Guizhou Children's Hospital, Zunyi 563000, Guizhou Province, China.

The serum levels of IFN-gamma, IL-4, IL-17 and TGF-beta were detected by ELISA in CLL group before and after treatment and in control group, then the differences of IFN-gamma, IL-4, IL-17 and TGF-beta levels as well as IFN-gamma/IL-4 ratio and TGF-beta/IL-17 ratio were compared between 2 groups. RESULTS: Before treatment with PCR regimen, the IL-4, IL-17 and TGF-beta levels as well as TGF-beta/IL-17 in CLL group were higher than those in control group (P<0.05), while the IFN-gamma level and IFN-gamma/IL-4 ratio in CLL group were lower than those in control group (P<0.05); after treatment with PCR regimen, the IL-4, IL-17 and TGF-beta levels as well as TGF-beta/IL-17 ratio all significantly decreased (P<0.05), while IFN-gamma level and IFN-gamma/IL-4 ratio significantly increased (P<0.05) as compared with those before treatment, moreover, the IL-4 and IL-17 levels as well as TGF-beta/ IL-17 and IFN-gamma /IL-4 ratio were no significantly different from those in control group (P>0.05), only the IFN-gamma and TGF-beta levels were significantly diffrent from control group (P<0.05). The analysis of Binet staging (stage A, B, C) showed that along with pregression of Binet stages, the TGF-gamma/IL-17 levels as well as the IFN-gamma/IL-4 ratio in CLL group negatively correlated with Binet staging (r=-0.53), while the TGF-beta/IL-17 ratio positively correlated with Binet staging (r=0.46).

METHODS: The clinical data of 45 newly diagnosed APL children admitted in our hospital from January 2004 to May 2017 were analyzed retrospectively. Among 45 APL children, 25 children were treated by chemotherapetic regimen including RIF (RIF group), another 20 children were treated by chemotherapeutic regimen including ATO (ATO group). The follow-up was performed in all APL children. The prognosis and incidence of side reactions from drugs in 2 groups were compared, and the high risk factors affecting the prognosis of patients were analyzed. RESULTS: The median follow-up time was 49.8% months. In RIF group, no early death occured in 25 APL children; 5 cases did not achieve complete remission (CR) after induction therapy, CR rate was 88%. Out of 25 cases 2 caes relapsed, 3 cases died, 20 cases maintained contined CR (CCR), 2 cases failed to be followed-up. In ATO group, 2 cases suffered from early death, 5 cases did not achieve CR after induction therapy, CR rate was 90%, 2 caese relapsed and died, 15 cases maintained CCR, the follow-up failed in 1 caes. The 5 year- OS and EFS rate in all the patients were predicted as (82.2+/-6.2)% and (76.4+/-6.6)% respectively. The OS and EFS rate in RIF group were (86.1+/-7.4)% and (78.4+/-8.6)% respectively, which were significantly different from OS and EFS rate (76.4%+/-10.6%) and (74.0%+/-10.1%) respectively in ATO group (all P>0.05). As for the side reaction from drug, except for the cardiac damage (P<0.05), incidence of other side reactions was not significantly different between 2 groups (P>0.05). In addition, the 5 year-OS and EFS rates in APL children with CNSL were significantly lower than those in APL children without CNSL (all P<0.05), the 5 year OS and EFS rate in APL children did not reache M1 and with high risk were significantly lower than those in APL children reached M1 after induction therapy and with low and standerd risk (P<0.05 and P<0.05); the 5 year-OS and EFS rates did not correlate with age and sex. CONCLUSION: The Fu Fang Huang Dai Pian shows the therapeutic efficacy on APL children same as ATO, moreover, no obvious enhancement in incidence of side reactions is observed, therefore, the Fu Fang Huang Dai Pian is effective and safe for treatment of APL children. The CNSL, poor respond to treatment, high risk in clinical stratification are high risk factors affecting prognosis of patients.","['Wang, Jian', 'Huang, Jun-Bin', 'Liu, Zu-Lin', 'Zhang, Bi-Hong', 'Xu, Hong-Gui', 'Xue, Hong-Man', 'Chen, Chun']","['Wang J', 'Huang JB', 'Liu ZL', 'Zhang BH', 'Xu HG', 'Xue HM', 'Chen C']","['Department of Pediatrics, Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou 510120, Guangdong Province, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, The Seventh Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Shenzhen 518017, Guangdong Province, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou 510120, Guangdong Province, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou 510120, Guangdong Province, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou 510120, Guangdong Province, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, The Seventh Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Shenzhen 518017, Guangdong Province, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, The Seventh Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Shenzhen 518017, Guangdong Province, China.

After treatment for 3, 6 and 12 month, the rate of major cytogenetic response (MCyR) was 78%, 79.4% and 95.9%, and the complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) rate was 48.8%, 66.7% and 73.5%, respectively. 60% patients obtained BCR-ABL(IS)<10% at 3 months, 56.3% patients obtained BCR-ABL(IS)<1% at 6 months, 55.2% patients obtained BCR-ABL(IS)<0.1% at 12 months. In continued imatinib therapy group, 53 patients (60.9%) obtained MR(4.5), and 33 cases (37.9%) obtained stable MR(4.5). Multivariate analysis showed that sex, WBC count at the time of diagnosis and BCR-ABL(IS) level at 3 months were independent factors for obtaining MR(4.5). The 3-month BCR-ABL(IS) level was an independent factor to obtain stable MR(4.5). 18 cases (40.9%) in the second-generation TKI group received MR(4.5) and the 3-month BCR-ABL(IS) level was also an independent predictor for MR(4.5). CONCLUSION: The excellent cytogenetic and molecular responses are observed in CML patients treated with cmatinib. Conversion to second-generation TKI therapy for patients with resistant or intolerant to imatinib also can achieve a satisfactory response and a higher rate of deeper molecular remission. The higher incidence of early molecular response predicting MR(4.5) and stable MR(4.5) is achieved.","['Jing, Yu', 'Yang, Lan', 'Liu, Dai-Hong']","['Jing Y', 'Yang L', 'Liu DH']","['Department of Hematology,Chinese PLA General Hospital,Beijing 100853, China.', 'Department of Hematology,Chinese PLA General Hospital,Beijing 100853, China.', 'Department of Hematology,Chinese PLA General Hospital,Beijing 100853, China.

METHODS: The expression of NS was interfered by transfection of P53-deficient HL-60 cells with the recombinant lentivirus expression vector NS-RNAi-GV248. The exression of NS and signal molecules of PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway were detected by Western blot. RESULTS: The fluorescence microscopy showed that the recombinant lentivirus vector NS-RNAi-GV248 transfected HL-60 cells successfully with a 80% transfection rate. Western blot showed that the expression of NS protein was inhibited obviously in HL-60 cells, and the expression levels of AKT, p-AKT, p70s6k and p-p70s6k were not statistically different(t1=2.31,P>0.05;t2=3.62,P>0.05;t3=1.60,P>0.05;t4=2.72,P>0.05) in comparison with control; the expression of GbetaL protein was statistically down-regnlated (t=15.01,P=0.002).

METHODS: Twenty-six newly diagnosed CML patients in the First Affilated Hospital of Soochow University from February 2015 to April 2015, 26 allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell donors as healthy controls and 26 patients treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) to obtain the best efficacy as post-treatment controls were enrolled in this study. All the metabolites of plasma were extracted by Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometer(GC-MS) to collect metabolic fingerprint. Multivariate pattern recognition analysis and t test were combined to screen out the metabolic biomarkers at different time points. The receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was used to evaluate the clinical efficacy of metabolites, and the metabolic pathway analysis was performed. RESULTS: Significantly different metabolite expression mode was found seen between CML and healthy control groups. Six changed metabolites in CML were confirmed by multivariate and variate statistical analyses. Compared with the healthy controls, the levels of tetradecanoic acid and glycerol were decreased, the lactic acid, myo-inositol, d-galactose and glycine in CML patients also increased (all VIP>1,P<0.05, AUC>0.7). The plasma metabolites in CML patients after treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) showed a recovery trend toward to normal levels. The plasma metabolic pathways of CML were mainly related with galactose, pyruvate, glycerolipid, inositol phosphate and glycine, serine and threonine metabolism (all impact value>0.10). CONCLUSION: Significant changes in plasma metabolite levels were found in CML patients. Metabolomics combined with multivariate pattern recognition analysis may be a new tool to assist diagnosis.","['Yang, Bing-Yu', 'Li, Xiao-Li', 'Yao, Yao', 'Wang, Chang', 'Chen, Su-Ning', 'Wu, Xiao-Jin', 'Wu, De-Pei']","['Yang BY', 'Li XL', 'Yao Y', 'Wang C', 'Chen SN', 'Wu XJ', 'Wu DP']","['Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Hemostasis of Ministry of Health, Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, Institute of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Suzhou 215006,Jiangsu Province,China.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Hemostasis of Ministry of Health, Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, Institute of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Suzhou 215006,Jiangsu Province,China.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Hemostasis of Ministry of Health, Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, Institute of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Suzhou 215006,Jiangsu Province,China.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Hemostasis of Ministry of Health, Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, Institute of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Suzhou 215006,Jiangsu Province,China.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Hemostasis of Ministry of Health, Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, Institute of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Suzhou 215006,Jiangsu Province,China.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Hemostasis of Ministry of Health, Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, Institute of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Suzhou 215006,Jiangsu Province,China.

It has excellent bioavailability and broad antifungal spectrum; thus, it is an attractive option for patients at high risk of invasive fungal infections (IFIs). Comparing efficacy and safety of voriconazole with other antifungals in prophylaxis or treatment of IFIs would be useful to draw conclusions regarding prevention and therapeutics of these infections. AIM: To assess efficacy and safety of voriconazole compared with other options as prophylaxis or treatment of IFIs in haematology-oncology patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A literature search was performed in MEDLINE database using the search term 'voriconazole' and completed with manual search. STUDY SELECTION: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing voriconazole with other antifungal agents or placebo. DATA EXTRACTION: Seven studies fulfilled the eligibility criteria. RESULTS: Five studies compared voriconazole to another comparator as prophylaxis of IFIs and two as treatment. Pooled results showed that voriconazole was more effective than the comparator (RR = 1.17; 95%CI = 1.01-1.34), but heterogeneity was significant (Q test 32.7; p = .00001). Sub-analysis according to prophylaxis showed RR = 1.17; 95%CI = 1.00-1.37; while as treatment, RR = 1.23; 95%CI = 0.68-2.22. Risk of adverse events was not different from that observed for the comparator (RR = 1.06, 95%CI = 0.66-1.72) though significant heterogeneity was detected (p < .01). CONCLUSIONS: Voriconazole was as effective and safe as comparators, probably better as prophylaxis than as treatment, but limitations due to variability in the sample size of studies, differences in the age of patients, and heterogeneity between studies' outcome measures indicate the need for further research.","['Rosanova, Maria Teresa', 'Bes, David', 'Serrano Aguilar, Pedro', 'Sberna, Norma', 'Lede, Roberto']","['Rosanova MT', 'Bes D', 'Serrano Aguilar P', 'Sberna N', 'Lede R']","['a Hospital de Pediatria J.

The hallmark of T-PLL is the rearrangement of chromosome 14 involving genes for the subunits of the T-cell receptor (TCR) complex, leading to overexpression of the proto-oncogene TCL1. In addition, molecular analysis shows that T-PLL exhibits substantial mutational activation of the IL2RG-JAK1-JAK3-, STAT5B axis. T-PLL patients have a poor prognosis, due to a poor response to conventional chemotherapy. Monoclonal antibody therapy with antiCD52-alemtuzumab has considerably improved outcomes, but the responses to treatment are transient; hence, patients who achieve a response to therapy are considered for stem cell transplantation (SCT).

BCR gene, closely related to ABR, acts as a tumor suppressor in chronic myeloid leukemia and has overlapping functions with ABR. Evidence for a putative tumor suppressor role of ABR has been shown in several solid tumors, in which deletion of ABR is present. Our results show downregulation of ABR in AML. A block of ABR prevents myeloid differentiation and leads to repression of the myeloid transcription factor C/EBPalpha, a major regulator of myeloid differentiation and functionally impaired in leukemia. Conversely, stable overexpression of ABR enhances myeloid differentiation. Inactivation of the known ABR target RAC1 by treatment with the RAC1 inhibitor NSC23766 resulted in an increased expression of C/EBPalpha in primary AML samples and in AML cell lines U937 and MV4;11. Finally, AML patients with high ABR expression at diagnosis showed a significant longer overall survival and patients who respond to azacitidine therapy showed a significant higher ABR expression.

We have recently identified a natural compound Quambalarine B (QB), which inhibits proliferation of several leukemic cell lines followed by cell death. We have predicted ubiquinone binding sites of mitochondrial respiratory complexes as potential molecular targets of QB in leukemia cells. Hence, we tracked the effect of QB on leukemia metabolism by applying several omics and biochemical techniques. We have confirmed the inhibition of respiratory complexes by QB and found an increase in the intracellular AMP levels together with respiratory substrates. Inhibition of mitochondrial respiration by QB triggered reprogramming of leukemic cell metabolism involving disproportions in glycolytic flux, inhibition of proteins O-glycosylation, stimulation of glycine synthesis pathway, and pyruvate kinase activity, followed by an increase in pyruvate and a decrease in lactate levels. Inhibition of mitochondrial complex I by QB suppressed folate metabolism as determined by a decrease in formate production. We have also observed an increase in cellular levels of several amino acids except for aspartate, indicating the dependence of Jurkat (T-ALL) cells on aspartate synthesis. These results indicate blockade of mitochondrial complex I and II activity by QB and reduction in aspartate and folate metabolism as therapeutic targets in T-ALL cells. Anti-cancer activity of QB was also confirmed during in vivo studies, suggesting the therapeutic potential of this natural compound.","['Valis, Karel', 'Grobarova, Valeria', 'Hernychova, Lucie', 'Buganova, Martina', 'Kavan, Daniel', 'Kalous, Martin', 'Cerny, Jiri', 'Stodulkova, Eva', 'Kuzma, Marek', 'Flieger, Miroslav', 'Cerny, Jan', 'Novak, Petr']","['Valis K', 'Grobarova V', 'Hernychova L', 'Buganova M', 'Kavan D', 'Kalous M', 'Cerny J', 'Stodulkova E', 'Kuzma M', 'Flieger M', 'Cerny J', 'Novak P']","['BIOCEV, Institute of Microbiology, v.v.i., The Czech Academy of Sciences, Vestec, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Science, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Cell Biology, Faculty of Science, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'BIOCEV, Institute of Microbiology, v.v.i., The Czech Academy of Sciences, Vestec, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Cell Biology, Faculty of Science, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Microbiology, v.v.i., The Czech Academy of Sciences, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Faculty of Chemical Technology, University of Chemistry and Technology, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Science, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Microbiology, v.v.i., The Czech Academy of Sciences, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Cell Biology, Faculty of Science, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'BIOCEV, Institute of Biotechnology, v.v.i., The Czech Academy of Sciences, Vestec, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Microbiology, v.v.i., The Czech Academy of Sciences, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Microbiology, v.v.i., The Czech Academy of Sciences, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Microbiology, v.v.i., The Czech Academy of Sciences, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Cell Biology, Faculty of Science, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'BIOCEV, Institute of Microbiology, v.v.i., The Czech Academy of Sciences, Vestec, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Science, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20171007,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,PMC5732718,['NOTNLM'],"['leukemia', 'metabolism', 'mitochondria', 'naphthoquinones', 'therapy']",2017/12/22 06:00,2017/12/22 06:01,['2017/12/22 06:00'],"['2017/07/14 00:00 [received]', '2017/09/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/12/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/12/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/22 06:01 [medline]']","['10.18632/oncotarget.21663 [doi]', '21663 [pii]']",epublish,Oncotarget. 2017 Oct 7;8(61):103137-103153. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.21663. eCollection 2017 Nov 28.,,61,,,,,,['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST Authors disclose no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nevertheless, it is very unlikely that inhibitors which target a single pathway will provide long-term disease control. Here, we report the characterization of crotonoside, a natural product extracted from Chinese medicinal herb, Croton, for the treatment of AML via inhibition of FLT3 and HDAC3/6. In vitro, crotonoside exhibited selective inhibition in AML cells. In vivo, crotonoside treatment at 70 and 35 mg/kg/d produced significant AML tumor inhibition rates of 93.5% and 73.6%, respectively. Studies on the anti-AML mechanism of crotonoside demonstrated a significant inhibition of FLT3 signaling, cell cycle arrest in G0/G1 phase, and apoptosis. In contrast to classic FLT3 inhibitor; sunitinib, crotonoside was able to selectively suppress the expression of HDAC3 and HDAC6 without altering the expression of other HDAC isoforms. Inhibitors of HDAC3 and HDAC6; RGFP966 and HPOB, respectively, also exhibited selective inhibition in AML cells. Furthermore, we established novel signaling pathways including HDAC3/NF-kappaB-p65 and HDAC6/c-Myc besides FLT3/c-Myc which are aberrantly regulated in the progression of AML. In addition, crotonoside alone or the combination of sunitinib/RFP966/HPOB exhibited a significant post-inhibition effect in AML cells by the inhibition of FLT3 and HDAC3/6. Inhibitors targeting the FLT3 and HDAC3/6 might provide a more effective treatment strategy for AML. Taken together, the present study suggests that crotonoside could be a promising candidate for the treatment of AML, and deserves further investigations.","['Li, Yu-Zhi', 'Yu, Si', 'Yan, Pei-Ao', 'Gong, Dao-Yin', 'Wu, Fang-Li', 'He, Zhi', 'Yuan, Yu-Yao', 'Zhao, An-Yan', 'Tang, Xue', 'Zhang, Ruo-Qi', 'Peng, Cheng', 'Cao, Zhi-Xing']","['Li YZ', 'Yu S', 'Yan PA', 'Gong DY', 'Wu FL', 'He Z', 'Yuan YY', 'Zhao AY', 'Tang X', 'Zhang RQ', 'Peng C', 'Cao ZX']","['Pharmacy College, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, The Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Standardization of Chinese Herbal Medicine, Key Laboratory of Systematic Research, Development and Utilization of Chinese Medicine Resources in Sichuan Province-Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Co-founded by Sichuan Province and MOST, Sichuan, China.', 'Pharmacy College, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, The Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Standardization of Chinese Herbal Medicine, Key Laboratory of Systematic Research, Development and Utilization of Chinese Medicine Resources in Sichuan Province-Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Co-founded by Sichuan Province and MOST, Sichuan, China.', 'Pharmacy College, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, The Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Standardization of Chinese Herbal Medicine, Key Laboratory of Systematic Research, Development and Utilization of Chinese Medicine Resources in Sichuan Province-Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Co-founded by Sichuan Province and MOST, Sichuan, China.', 'Pharmacy College, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, The Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Standardization of Chinese Herbal Medicine, Key Laboratory of Systematic Research, Development and Utilization of Chinese Medicine Resources in Sichuan Province-Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Co-founded by Sichuan Province and MOST, Sichuan, China.', 'Second Clinical Medical College, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Sichuan, China.', 'Second Clinical Medical College, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Sichuan, China.', 'Second Clinical Medical College, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Sichuan, China.', 'Second Clinical Medical College, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Sichuan, China.', 'Pharmacy College, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, The Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Standardization of Chinese Herbal Medicine, Key Laboratory of Systematic Research, Development and Utilization of Chinese Medicine Resources in Sichuan Province-Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Co-founded by Sichuan Province and MOST, Sichuan, China.', 'Pharmacy College, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, The Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Standardization of Chinese Herbal Medicine, Key Laboratory of Systematic Research, Development and Utilization of Chinese Medicine Resources in Sichuan Province-Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Co-founded by Sichuan Province and MOST, Sichuan, China.', 'Pharmacy College, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, The Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Standardization of Chinese Herbal Medicine, Key Laboratory of Systematic Research, Development and Utilization of Chinese Medicine Resources in Sichuan Province-Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Co-founded by Sichuan Province and MOST, Sichuan, China.', 'Pharmacy College, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, The Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Standardization of Chinese Herbal Medicine, Key Laboratory of Systematic Research, Development and Utilization of Chinese Medicine Resources in Sichuan Province-Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Co-founded by Sichuan Province and MOST, Sichuan, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20170908,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,PMC5732713,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'FLT3', 'HDAC3', 'HDAC6', 'crotonoside']",2017/12/22 06:00,2017/12/22 06:01,['2017/12/22 06:00'],"['2017/02/10 00:00 [received]', '2017/08/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/12/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/12/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/22 06:01 [medline]']","['10.18632/oncotarget.20710 [doi]', '20710 [pii]']",epublish,Oncotarget. 2017 Sep 8;8(61):103087-103099. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.20710. eCollection 2017 Nov 28.,,61,,,,,,['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST The authors declare no conflicts of interests.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Given the importance of non-malignant T cells in regulating clonal expansion in CLL, we investigated the role of AKT in T cell-mediated cytoprotection and proliferation using an established co-culture system in which primary CLL cells were incubated on a monolayer of transfected mouse fibroblasts expressing human CD40L (CD154). Stimulation of CLL cells via CD40 induced activation of AKT, which was closely associated with downregulation of its negative regulator PTEN, and protected CLL cells from killing by bendamustine. This cytoprotective effect of CD40 stimulation was prevented by a selective inhibitor of AKT. Stimulation of CLL cells with CD154 + IL-4 or IL-21 induced proliferation detected as reduced fluorescence of cells pre-stained with CFSE. AKT inhibition produced a significant, consistent reduction in proliferation induced by CD154 + IL-4 and a reduction in proliferation induced by CD154 + IL-21 in most but not all cases. In contrast, AKT inhibition had no effect on the proliferation of normal B cells induced by CD154 + IL-4 or IL-21.

Methods: The co-culture model of acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell Sup-B15 and bone marrow stromal cell OP9 was constructed. Sup-B15 cells were cultured alone or co-cultured with OP9 cells, inactivated OP9 cells, the conditional medium (CM) of co-cultured OP9 cells and Sup-B15 cells, the CM of OP9 cells alone or Sup-B15 cells alone, respectively. The effects of different concentrations of Ara-C on the proliferation of each Sup-B1 cell group mentioned above were detected by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) method. The effects of different concentrations of Ara-C on the apoptosis of each group were detected by flow cytometry (FCM). The expressions of Bcl-2 protein in each group were detected by western blot. Results: The results of CCK-8 test showed that the inhibitory efficiency of Ara-C was in a dose-dependent manner. With different concentrations of Ara-C treatment for 48 hours, the half maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC(50)) of Sup-B15 and OP9 co-cultured group, Sup-B15 and inactivated OP9 co-cultured group were 0.510 and 0.339 mug/ml, respectively, significantly higher than 0.091 mug/ml of Sup-B15 cultured alone group (P<0.05). The IC(50) of CM of Sup-B15 and OP9 co-cultured group was 0.204 mug/ml, significantly higher than 0.087 mug/ml of the CM of OP9 cultured alone group (P<0.05) and 0.097 mug/ml of the CM of Sup-B15 cultured alone group (P<0.05). The results of flow cytometry showed that with 0.10 mug/ml Ara-C treatment for 24 hours, the early apoptotic cell percentages of Sup-B15 and OP9 co-cultured group, Sup-B15 and inactivated OP9 co-cultured group and Sup-B15 cultured alone group were (6.67+/-2.19) %, (8.95+/-3.04) % and (20.46+/-2.63) %, respectively. The early apoptotic cell percentages of Sup-B15 and OP9 co-cultured group, Sup-B15 and inactivated OP9 co-cultured group were significantly lower than that of Sup-B15 cultured alone group (P<0.05). The early apoptotic cell percentages of the CM of Sup-B15 and OP9 co-cultured group, the CM of OP9 cultured alone group and the CM of Sup-B15 cultured alone group were (11.16+/-2.97)%, (22.08+/-2.71)% and (19.25+/-1.57)%, respectively, the former two of which were significantly lower than the last one (P<0.05). The results of western blot showed that the relative expression levels of Bcl-2 protein of Sup-B15 cultured alone group, Sup-B15 and OP9 co-cultured group, Sup-B15 and inactivated OP9 co-cultured group, the CM of Sup-B15 and OP9 co-cultured group, the CM of OP9 cultured alone group and the CM of Sup-B15 cultured alone group were 1.00+/-0.00, 1.53+/-0.03, 1.38+/-0.01, 1.26+/-0.05, 1.03+/-0.01 and 0.98+/-0.02, respectively.

However, the physiological role of HLF in hematopoiesis and HSC function is unclear. Here, we report that mice lacking Hlf are viable with essentially normal hematopoietic parameters, including an intact HSC pool during steady-state hematopoiesis. In contrast, when challenged through transplantation, Hlf-deficient HSCs showed an impaired ability to reconstitute hematopoiesis and became gradually exhausted upon serial transplantation. Transcriptional profiling of Hlf-deficient HSCs revealed changes associated with enhanced cellular activation, and cell-cycle analysis demonstrated a significant reduction of quiescent HSCs. Accordingly, toxic insults targeting dividing cells completely eradicated the HSC pool in Hlf-deficient mice. In summary, our findings point to HLF as a critical regulator of HSC quiescence and as an essential factor for maintaining the HSC pool during regeneration.","['Komorowska, Karolina', 'Doyle, Alexander', 'Wahlestedt, Martin', 'Subramaniam, Agatheeswaran', 'Debnath, Shubhranshu', 'Chen, Jun', 'Soneji, Shamit', 'Van Handel, Ben', 'Mikkola, Hanna K A', 'Miharada, Kenichi', 'Bryder, David', 'Larsson, Jonas', 'Magnusson, Mattias']","['Komorowska K', 'Doyle A', 'Wahlestedt M', 'Subramaniam A', 'Debnath S', 'Chen J', 'Soneji S', 'Van Handel B', 'Mikkola HKA', 'Miharada K', 'Bryder D', 'Larsson J', 'Magnusson M']","['Molecular Medicine and Gene Therapy, Lund Stem Cell Center, Lund University, BMC A12, 221 84, Lund, Sweden.', 'Molecular Medicine and Gene Therapy, Lund Stem Cell Center, Lund University, BMC A12, 221 84, Lund, Sweden.', 'Molecular Hematology, Lund Stem Cell Center, Lund University, BMC A12, 221 84, Lund, Sweden.', 'Molecular Medicine and Gene Therapy, Lund Stem Cell Center, Lund University, BMC A12, 221 84, Lund, Sweden.', 'Molecular Medicine and Gene Therapy, Lund Stem Cell Center, Lund University, BMC A12, 221 84, Lund, Sweden.', 'Molecular Medicine and Gene Therapy, Lund Stem Cell Center, Lund University, BMC A12, 221 84, Lund, Sweden.', 'Molecular Hematology, Lund Stem Cell Center, Lund University, BMC A12, 221 84, Lund, Sweden.', 'Department of Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA 90033, USA; CarthroniX, Inc., Tarzana, CA 91356, USA.', 'Department of Molecular, Cell and Developmental Biology, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90095, USA.', 'Molecular Medicine and Gene Therapy, Lund Stem Cell Center, Lund University, BMC A12, 221 84, Lund, Sweden.', 'Molecular Hematology, Lund Stem Cell Center, Lund University, BMC A12, 221 84, Lund, Sweden.', 'Molecular Medicine and Gene Therapy, Lund Stem Cell Center, Lund University, BMC A12, 221 84, Lund, Sweden.', 'Molecular Medicine and Gene Therapy, Lund Stem Cell Center, Lund University, BMC A12, 221 84, Lund, Sweden.

CLL/SLL is defined as a monoclonal lymphoproliferative disease characterized by the proliferation and accumulation of morphologically mature but immunologically dysfunctional B-cell lymphocytes that are smudge cells, as noted on peripheral smear. The primary disease sites include peripheral blood, spleen, lymph nodes, and bone marrow. CLL and SLL are identical from a pathologic and immunophenotypic standpoint. Both CLL and SLL originate from B-cell lymphocytes but present with different manifestations depending on where the abnormal cells are found. Usually, the initial leukemic phase represents CLL, where the cells are present in the blood. This eventually progresses to the lymphoma phase, representing SLL, where the cells are found in the lymph nodes. The term SLL is commonly used to represent the lymphoproliferative process limited to the lymph nodes.","['Mukkamalla, Shiva Kumar R.', 'Taneja, Alankrita', 'Malipeddi, Dhatri', 'Master, Samip R.']","['Mukkamalla SKR', 'Taneja A', 'Malipeddi D', 'Master SR']",,['eng'],,"['Review', 'Book Chapter']",,Treasure Island (FL),,,,,,,2017/12/22 06:01,2017/12/22 06:01,,,['NBK470433 [bookaccession]'],,,,,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2022, StatPearls Publishing LLC.']",,,,,,,,,20171222,,['StatPearls Publishing'],,['StatPearls'],['2017/12/22 06:01'],,,,['20211001'],

We describe the implementation and results of prophylactic anticoagulation guidelines in adults (18-50 years) treated on a Dana-Farber Cancer Institute ALL pediatric inspired consortium protocol from 2007 to 2013. A high rate of asparaginase related toxicity events, including thrombosis, resulted in a protocol amendment adding guidelines for prophylactic anticoagulation and a modified asparaginase dose and schedule. After excluding patients with Philadelphia positive ALL, a cohort of 36 patients were treated after the protocol amendment with prophylactic anticoagulation and compared to 49 patients who received no prophylactic anticoagulation. Bleeding complications were not significantly different in those treated with prophylactic anticoagulation compared with those enrolled prior to the amendment (p = 0.26). No patients on prophylactic anticoagulation had grade >/= 3 bleeding. Prior to the amendment, the 2 year cumulative incidence of VTE post-induction was 41% compared to 28% while on prophylactic anticoagulation (p = 0.32). The 2 year cumulative incidence pulmonary embolus pre-amendment was 16% compared with 8% post-amendment (p = 0.34). Prophylactic anticoagulation can be safely administered to adults with ALL without increasing the number or severity of bleeding events and, in addition to modifications in the asparaginase regimen, resulted in a reduction in the cumulative incidence of VTE.","['Grace, Rachael F', 'DeAngelo, Daniel J', 'Stevenson, Kristen E', 'Neuberg, Donna', 'Sallan, Stephen E', 'Mourad, Yasser R Abou', 'Bergeron, Julie', 'Seftel, Matthew D', 'Kokulis, Caroline', 'Connors, Jean M']","['Grace RF', 'DeAngelo DJ', 'Stevenson KE', 'Neuberg D', 'Sallan SE', 'Mourad YRA', 'Bergeron J', 'Seftel MD', 'Kokulis C', 'Connors JM']","[""Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Dana-Farber/Boston Children's Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, 450 Brookline Avenue, D3-106, Boston, MA, 02450, USA.

Sedation with general anesthesia (GA) is often used to promote compliance, reduce motion, and alleviate anxiety. The use of GA for MRI scans is costly in terms of time, personnel, and medications. In addition, prominent risks are associated with anesthesia exposure in patients with complex medical conditions. Successful behavioral interventions have been implemented in clinical research settings to promote scan success and compliance. To our knowledge, parent/caregiver acceptability of behavioral interventions to promote nonsedated MRI has not been systematically investigated in a medically complex population. As a first step toward developing a protocol-based intervention to promote nonsedated scanning, we conducted a survey to explore parental perspectives regarding acceptability of nonsedated scanning and to gain information regarding preference for specific behavioral interventions to facilitate nonsedated MRI exams. METHODS: Parents or guardians of 101 patients diagnosed with childhood cancer participated in a semi-structured survey via telephone. The sample was stratified by age group (8-12 years; 13-18 years), gender, and diagnosis (solid tumor (ST), brain tumor (BT), and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)). RESULTS: The majority of parents indicated that nonsedated MRI scans would be acceptable. Reduced anesthesia exposure was the most frequently identified benefit, followed by decreased irritability post-MRI scan, and shorter appointment time. Challenges included fear of movement and noise during scans and change in routine, with parents of younger children and those with a history of sedated exams identifying more challenges. Behavioral intervention preference differed by patient age and gender; however, education was ranked as most preferred overall. CONCLUSION: Parents of children treated for cancer consider behavior interventions to promote nonsedated scanning as acceptable. Patient characteristics should be considered when tailoring behavioral interventions. Results can inform future studies of behavioral interventions to promote nonsedated MRI scans. Future research should also investigate the risks associated with failed exams, both in terms of patient medical care and cost effectiveness.","['Walker, Breya', 'Conklin, Heather M', 'Anghelescu, Doralina L', 'Hall, Lacey P', 'Reddick, Wilburn E', 'Ogg, Robert', 'Jacola, Lisa M']","['Walker B', 'Conklin HM', 'Anghelescu DL', 'Hall LP', 'Reddick WE', 'Ogg R', 'Jacola LM']","[""Department of Pediatric Medicine, Division of Nursing Research, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, 262 Danny Thomas Place, MS738, Memphis, TN, 38105, USA."", ""Department of Psychology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, 262 Danny Thomas Place, MS740, Memphis, TN, 38105, USA."", ""Department of Pediatric Medicine, Division of Anesthesiology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, 262 Danny Thomas Place, MS130, Memphis, TN, 38105, USA."", ""Department of Psychology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, 262 Danny Thomas Place, MS740, Memphis, TN, 38105, USA."", ""Department of Diagnostic Imaging, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, 262 Danny Thomas Place, MS220, Memphis, TN, 38105, USA."", ""Department of Diagnostic Imaging, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, 262 Danny Thomas Place, MS220, Memphis, TN, 38105, USA."", ""Department of Psychology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, 262 Danny Thomas Place, MS740, Memphis, TN, 38105, USA. lisa.jacola@stjude.org.""]",['eng'],"['P30 CA021765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA21765/National Cancer Institute']",['Journal Article'],20171219,Germany,Support Care Cancer,Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer,9302957,PMC5940333,['NOTNLM'],"['Adolescents/child', 'Caregiver', 'MRI', 'Pediatric cancer', 'Sedation', 'Strategies']",2017/12/21 06:00,2019/02/02 06:00,['2017/12/21 06:00'],"['2017/06/15 00:00 [received]', '2017/12/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/12/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/02/02 06:00 [medline]', '2017/12/21 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00520-017-4009-9 [doi]', '10.1007/s00520-017-4009-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Support Care Cancer. 2018 Jun;26(6):1815-1824. doi: 10.1007/s00520-017-4009-9.

Observations: An unusual case of infectious orbital apex syndrome due to contiguous spread of Streptococcus viridans sphenoethmoiditis in a hospitalized, immunosuppressed patient with acute myelogenous leukemia is presented. Given the few clinic signs and subtle imaging findings, a delay in diagnosis occurred resulting in vision loss to light perception and internal carotid artery occlusion within the cavernous sinus. A brief literature review of orbital apex syndromes is presented. Conclusion and importance: A high clinical suspicion for orbital apex syndrome must be maintained in the appropriate circumstance given the subtle clinical signs and imaging, as well as the potential devastating morbidity of the disease process. Prompt diagnosis and treatment is crucial to patient survival and preservation of vision.","['Bodily, Lance', 'Yu, Jenny', 'Sorrentino, Dante', 'Branstetter, Barton']","['Bodily L', 'Yu J', 'Sorrentino D', 'Branstetter B']","['University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Department of Ophthalmology, 203 Lothrop St, Pittsburgh, PA 15213, United States.', 'University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Department of Ophthalmology, 203 Lothrop St, Pittsburgh, PA 15213, United States.', 'University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Department of Ophthalmology, 203 Lothrop St, Pittsburgh, PA 15213, United States.', 'University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Department of Radiology, 200 Lothrop St, Pittsburgh, PA 15213, United States.']",['eng'],,['Case Reports'],20170721,United States,Am J Ophthalmol Case Rep,American journal of ophthalmology case reports,101679941,PMC5731554,['NOTNLM'],"['Optic nerve', 'Orbit', 'Orbital apex syndrome', 'Sinusitis']",2017/12/21 06:00,2017/12/21 06:01,['2017/12/21 06:00'],"['2016/11/11 00:00 [received]', '2017/07/08 00:00 [revised]', '2017/07/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/12/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/12/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/21 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1016/j.ajoc.2017.07.006 [doi]', 'S2451-9936(16)30259-6 [pii]']",epublish,Am J Ophthalmol Case Rep. 2017 Jul 21;8:4-6. doi: 10.1016/j.ajoc.2017.07.006. eCollection 2017 Dec.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Initial investigation showed pancytopenia and radiological imaging was suggestive of necrotizing pneumonia. Subsequently, mucor was isolated from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, but even on appropriate medications her condition kept deteriorating. She had multiple bouts of hemoptysis and a repeat imaging of chest showed dissemination of mucormycosis to pulmonary vein and heart. Bone marrow biopsy identified acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) as the cause of pancytopenia. She was planned for bronchial artery embolization and chemotherapy for ALL, but consent was not given and she left our institute against medical advice. Our case highlights the importance of keeping a high index of suspicion for disseminated mucormycosis in neutropenic patients, as any delay in diagnosis and treatment could have grave consequences.","['Tansir, Ghazal', 'Rastogi, Neha', 'Ramteke, Prashant', 'Kumar, Prabhat', 'Soneja, Manish', 'Biswas, Ashutosh', 'Kumar, Sanchit', 'Jorwal, Pankaj', 'Baitha, Upendra']","['Tansir G', 'Rastogi N', 'Ramteke P', 'Kumar P', 'Soneja M', 'Biswas A', 'Kumar S', 'Jorwal P', 'Baitha U']","['Department of Medicine, All India Institute of Medical Science, New Delhi, India.', 'Division of Infectious Disease, Department of Medicine and Microbiology.

It has been reported that autophagy, an important event in various cellular processes, plays a crucial role in mediating drug-resistance to cancer cells. Our study attempts to comparatively investigate the differences of basic and induced autophagic activity between drug-sensitive and multidrug-resistant AML cells. The level of basic autophagy in K562/ADM cells was higher than that in K562 cells, which could be characterized by more cytosolic contents-packaged autophagic vacuoles in K562/ADM cells when compared to that in K562 cells. The observation of MDC staining showed that the fluorescent intensity of autophagosomes in K562/ADM cells was stronger than that in K562 cells. The expression of Beclin1 and the ratio of LC3-II to LC3-I were distinctly higher in K562/ADM cells, however, P62 protein was relatively lower in K562/ADM cells. Furthermore, we found that nutrient depletion could induce autophagic activity of both cell lines. However, autophagic activity of K562/ADM cells was always maintained at a higher level in contrast with K562 cells. ADM (Adriamycin) was also capable of inducing autophagic activity of K562 and K562/ADM cells, but the autophagic alteration in K562 cells appeared earlier. Taken together, our findings suggest that autophagy exerts an important effect on formation and maintenance of drug-resistance in AML cells.","['Wang, Feifei', 'Chen, Jing', 'Zhang, Zhewen', 'Yi, Juan', 'Yuan, Minmin', 'Wang, Mingyan', 'Zhang, Na', 'Qiu, Xuemin', 'Wei, Hulai', 'Wang, Ling']","['Wang F', 'Chen J', 'Zhang Z', 'Yi J', 'Yuan M', 'Wang M', 'Zhang N', 'Qiu X', 'Wei H', 'Wang L']","['Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', 'The Academy of Integrative Medicine of Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', 'Laboratory for Reproductive Immunology, Hospital & Institute of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Fudan University Shanghai Medical College, Shanghai, China.', 'Shanghai Key Laboratory of Female Reproductive Endocrine Related Diseases, Shanghai, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Preclinical Study for New Drugs of Gansu Province, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, Gansu Province, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Preclinical Study for New Drugs of Gansu Province, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, Gansu Province, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Preclinical Study for New Drugs of Gansu Province, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, Gansu Province, China.', 'Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', 'The Academy of Integrative Medicine of Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', 'Laboratory for Reproductive Immunology, Hospital & Institute of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Fudan University Shanghai Medical College, Shanghai, China.', 'Shanghai Key Laboratory of Female Reproductive Endocrine Related Diseases, Shanghai, China.', 'Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', 'The Academy of Integrative Medicine of Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', 'Laboratory for Reproductive Immunology, Hospital & Institute of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Fudan University Shanghai Medical College, Shanghai, China.', 'Shanghai Key Laboratory of Female Reproductive Endocrine Related Diseases, Shanghai, China.', 'Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', 'The Academy of Integrative Medicine of Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', 'Laboratory for Reproductive Immunology, Hospital & Institute of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Fudan University Shanghai Medical College, Shanghai, China.', 'Shanghai Key Laboratory of Female Reproductive Endocrine Related Diseases, Shanghai, China.', 'Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', 'The Academy of Integrative Medicine of Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', 'Laboratory for Reproductive Immunology, Hospital & Institute of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Fudan University Shanghai Medical College, Shanghai, China.', 'Shanghai Key Laboratory of Female Reproductive Endocrine Related Diseases, Shanghai, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Preclinical Study for New Drugs of Gansu Province, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, Gansu Province, China.', 'Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', 'The Academy of Integrative Medicine of Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', 'Laboratory for Reproductive Immunology, Hospital & Institute of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Fudan University Shanghai Medical College, Shanghai, China.', 'Shanghai Key Laboratory of Female Reproductive Endocrine Related Diseases, Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Japan,Intractable Rare Dis Res,Intractable & rare diseases research,101586847,PMC5735282,['NOTNLM'],"['Autophagic activity', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'drug-resistance']",2017/12/21 06:00,2017/12/21 06:01,['2017/12/21 06:00'],"['2017/12/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/12/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/21 06:01 [medline]']",['10.5582/irdr.2017.01069 [doi]'],ppublish,Intractable Rare Dis Res. 2017 Nov;6(4):281-290. doi: 10.5582/irdr.2017.01069.,,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PKD2 is activated by many stimuli including growth factors, phorbol esters, and G-protein-coupled receptor agonists. PKD2 participation to uncontrolled growth, survival, neovascularization, metastasis, and invasion has been documented in various tumor types including pancreatic, colorectal, gastric, hepatic, lung, prostate, and breast cancer, as well as glioma multiforme and leukemia. This review discusses the versatile functions of PKD2 from the perspective of cancer hallmarks as described by Hanahan and Weinberg. The PKD2 status, signaling pathways affected in different tumor types and the molecular mechanisms that lead to tumorigenesis and tumor progression are presented. The latest developments of small-molecule inhibitors selective for PKD/PKD2, as well as the need for further chemotherapies that prevent, slow down, or eliminate tumors are also discussed in this review.","['Azoitei, Ninel', 'Cobbaut, Mathias', 'Becher, Alexander', 'Van Lint, Johan', 'Seufferlein, Thomas']","['Azoitei N', 'Cobbaut M', 'Becher A', 'Van Lint J', 'Seufferlein T']","['Center for Internal Medicine I, University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany. ninel.azoitei@uni-ulm.de.', 'Laboratory for Protein Phosphorylation and Proteomics, Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Leuven Cancer Institute, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Center for Internal Medicine I, University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Laboratory for Protein Phosphorylation and Proteomics, Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Leuven Cancer Institute, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Center for Internal Medicine I, University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20171220,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,,,,2017/12/21 06:00,2019/03/12 06:00,['2017/12/21 06:00'],"['2017/08/09 00:00 [received]', '2017/09/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/09/14 00:00 [revised]', '2017/12/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/12 06:00 [medline]', '2017/12/21 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41388-017-0052-8 [doi]', '10.1038/s41388-017-0052-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2018 Mar;37(10):1263-1278. doi: 10.1038/s41388-017-0052-8.

Established clinical and genetic markers fail to fully recapitulate the clinical and biological heterogeneity of this disease. Here we report DNA methylome analysis and mutation profiling of 167 JMML samples. We identify three JMML subgroups with unique molecular and clinical characteristics. The high methylation group (HM) is characterized by somatic PTPN11 mutations and poor clinical outcome. The low methylation group is enriched for somatic NRAS and CBL mutations, as well as for Noonan patients, and has a good prognosis. The intermediate methylation group (IM) shows enrichment for monosomy 7 and somatic KRAS mutations. Hypermethylation is associated with repressed chromatin, genes regulated by RAS signaling, frequent co-occurrence of RAS pathway mutations and upregulation of DNMT1 and DNMT3B, suggesting a link between activation of the DNA methylation machinery and mutational patterns in JMML.","['Lipka, Daniel B', 'Witte, Tania', 'Toth, Reka', 'Yang, Jing', 'Wiesenfarth, Manuel', 'Nollke, Peter', 'Fischer,

Here, we report clonal shifts (change >0.1 in clonal cancer cell fraction, Q < 0.1) in 31% of patients during the first year of therapy, associated with adverse outcome. We also observe transcriptional downregulation of pathways mediating energy metabolism, cell cycle, and B cell receptor signaling. Known and previously undescribed mutations in BTK and PLCG2, or uncommonly, other candidate alterations are present in seventeen subjects at the time of progression. Thus, the frequently observed clonal shifts during the early treatment period and its potential association with adverse outcome may reflect greater evolutionary capacity, heralding the emergence of drug-resistant clones.","['Landau, Dan A', 'Sun, Clare', 'Rosebrock, Daniel', 'Herman, Sarah E M', 'Fein, Joshua', 'Sivina, Mariela', 'Underbayev, Chingiz', 'Liu, Delong', 'Hoellenriegel, Julia',

Outcomes in JMML vary markedly from spontaneous resolution to rapid relapse after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Here, we hypothesized that DNA methylation patterns would help predict disease outcome and therefore performed genome-wide DNA methylation profiling in a cohort of 39 patients. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering identifies three clusters of patients. Importantly, these clusters differ significantly in terms of 4-year event-free survival, with the lowest methylation cluster having the highest rates of survival. These findings were validated in an independent cohort of 40 patients. Notably, all but one of 14 patients experiencing spontaneous resolution cluster together and closer to 22 healthy controls than to other JMML cases. Thus, we show that DNA methylation patterns in JMML are predictive of outcome and can identify the patients most likely to experience spontaneous resolution.","['Stieglitz, Elliot', 'Mazor, Tali',

It can inhibit human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) replication at multiple stages and interact with apolipoprotein-B-mRNA-editing enzyme catalytic polypeptide-like 3G (APOBEC3G or A3G), a member of the cytidine deaminase family that exerts potent inhibitory effects against HIV-1 infection. However, HIV-1-encoded virion infectivity factor (Vif) protein specifically mediates the degradation of A3G via the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). RESULTS: We demonstrate that MOV10 counteracts Vif-mediated degradation of A3G by inhibiting the assembly of the Vif-CBF-beta-Cullin 5-ElonginB-ElonginC complex. Through interference with UPS, MOV10 enhances the level of A3G in HIV-1-infected cells and virions, and synergistically inhibits the replication and infectivity of HIV-1. In addition, the DEAG-box of MOV10 is required for inhibition of Vif-mediated A3G degradation as the DEAG-box mutant significantly loses this ability. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate a novel mechanism involved in the anti-HIV-1 function of MOV10. Given that both MOV10 and A3G belong to the interferon antiviral system, their synergistic inhibition of HIV-1 suggests that these proteins may play complicated roles in antiviral functions.","['Chen, Cancan', 'Ma, Xiaocao', 'Hu, Qifei', 'Li, Xinghua', 'Huang, Feng', 'Zhang, Junsong', 'Pan, Ting', 'Xia, Jinyu', 'Liu, Chao', 'Zhang, Hui']","['Chen C', 'Ma X', 'Hu Q', 'Li X', 'Huang F', 'Zhang J', 'Pan T', 'Xia J', 'Liu C', 'Zhang H']","['Institute of Human Virology, Zhongshan School of Medicine, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, 510080, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Tropical Disease Control of Ministry of Education, Zhongshan School of Medicine, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, 510080, China.', 'Department of Pathology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, 510080, China.', 'Institute of Human Virology, Zhongshan School of Medicine, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, 510080, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Tropical Disease Control of Ministry of Education, Zhongshan School of Medicine, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, 510080, China.', 'Institute of Human Virology, Zhongshan School of Medicine, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, 510080, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Tropical Disease Control of Ministry of Education, Zhongshan School of Medicine, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, 510080, China.', 'Department of Infectious Diseases, The Fifth Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Zhuhai, 519000, China.', 'Institute of Human Virology, Zhongshan School of Medicine, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, 510080, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Tropical Disease Control of Ministry of Education, Zhongshan School of Medicine, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, 510080, China.', 'Institute of Human Virology, Zhongshan School of Medicine, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, 510080, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Tropical Disease Control of Ministry of Education, Zhongshan School of Medicine, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, 510080, China.', 'Institute of Human Virology, Zhongshan School of Medicine, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, 510080, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Tropical Disease Control of Ministry of Education, Zhongshan School of Medicine, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, 510080, China.', 'Department of Infectious Diseases, The Fifth Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Zhuhai, 519000, China.', 'Institute of Human Virology, Zhongshan School of Medicine, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, 510080, China. liuchao9@mail.sysu.edu.cn.', 'Key Laboratory of Tropical Disease Control of Ministry of Education, Zhongshan School of Medicine, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, 510080, China. liuchao9@mail.sysu.edu.cn.', 'Institute of Human Virology, Zhongshan School of Medicine, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, 510080, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Tropical Disease Control of Ministry of Education, Zhongshan School of Medicine, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, 510080, China.']",['eng'],"['No. 81471935/National Natural Science Foundation of China', 'No. 81561128007/National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC-NIH project)', 'No. 81590765/Important Key Program of Natural Science Foundation of China', 'No. 2009010058/Introduction of Innovative R&D Team Program of Guangdong Province', 'No. 201508020256/Joint-innovation Program in Healthcare for Special Scientific', 'Research Projects of Guangzhou, China']",['Journal Article'],20171219,England,Retrovirology,Retrovirology,101216893,PMC5735797,['NOTNLM'],"['A3G', 'HIV-1', 'MOV10', 'Ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS)', 'Vif']",2017/12/21 06:00,2018/07/18 06:00,['2017/12/21 06:00'],"['2017/09/13 00:00 [received]', '2017/12/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/12/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/12/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/07/18 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12977-017-0382-1 [doi]', '10.1186/s12977-017-0382-1 [pii]']",epublish,Retrovirology. 2017 Dec 19;14(1):56. doi: 10.1186/s12977-017-0382-1.,20180717,1,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Ubiquitin)', '0 (vif Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Mov10 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (APOBEC-3G Deaminase)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (APOBEC3G protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.4.13 (RNA Helicases)']",IM,"['APOBEC-3G Deaminase/*metabolism', 'Antiviral Agents/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'HEK293 Cells', 'HIV Infections/enzymology/*metabolism/virology', 'Host-Pathogen Interactions/physiology', 'Humans', 'Mutation', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/*metabolism', 'RNA Helicases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Ubiquitin/metabolism', 'Virus Replication', 'vif Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus/*metabolism']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3863-7210'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The Lund Childhood Cancer Genetic study includes newly diagnosed childhood cancer patients as well as childhood cancer survivors visiting the Department of Pediatrics or the Late Effect Clinic at Skane University Hospital, Lund, Sweden. Questionnaires regarding family history of cancer and blood samples were provided. Reported data were validated and extended by use of the Swedish Population- and Cancer Registries. Demographics in families with one case of childhood cancer (FAM1) were investigated and compared to families with multiple cases of childhood cancer (FAM > 1) as well as to childhood cancer in the general population. RESULTS: Forty-one out of 528 families (7.8%) had more than one case of childhood cancer. In 23 families the affected children were relatives up to a 3rd degree (4.4%). In FAM > 1, 69.2% of the children with leukemia and 60% of those with tumors in the central nervous system (CNS) had a childhood relative with matching diagnosis, both significantly higher than expected. Significantly more female than male patients were observed in FAM > 1 compared to FAM1. This female predominance was most striking in childhood leukemia (77% female) and also, yet to a lesser extent, in CNS tumors (68% female). CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the high proportion of children with leukemia or CNS tumors in FAM > 1 having a childhood relative with the same diagnosis suggests a hereditary background. Moreover, we report a female predominance in childhood leukemia and childhood CNS tumors in FAM > 1, which may indicate a hereditary gender-specific risk factor in these families.","['Stjernfelt, Karl-Johan', 'von Stedingk, Kristoffer', 'Wiebe, Thomas', 'Hjorth, Lars', 'Olsson, Hakan', 'Ora, Ingrid']","['Stjernfelt KJ', 'von Stedingk K', 'Wiebe T', 'Hjorth L', 'Olsson H', 'Ora I']","['Department of Pediatrics, Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, Lund University, Skane University Hospital, Lund, Sweden.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, Lund University, Skane University Hospital, Lund, Sweden.', 'Translational Cancer Research, Medicon Village, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, Lund University, Skane University Hospital, Lund, Sweden.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, Lund University, Skane University Hospital, Lund, Sweden.', 'Department of Oncology, Lund University, Skane University Hospital, Lund, Sweden.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, Lund University, Skane University Hospital, Lund, Sweden. ingrid.ora@med.lu.se.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Clinical Sciences, Lund University, Skane University Hospital, 22185, Lund, Sweden. ingrid.ora@med.lu.se.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20171219,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,PMC5738226,['NOTNLM'],"['Familial cancer predisposition', 'Genetic cancer susceptibility', 'Hereditary cancer syndrome', 'Pediatric cancer']",2017/12/21 06:00,2018/07/24 06:00,['2017/12/21 06:00'],"['2016/06/06 00:00 [received]', '2017/12/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/12/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/12/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/07/24 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12885-017-3899-8 [doi]', '10.1186/s12885-017-3899-8 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2017 Dec 19;17(1):868. doi: 10.1186/s12885-017-3899-8.,20180723,1,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/*epidemiology/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology/pathology', 'Male', 'Registries', 'Risk Factors', 'Sex Characteristics', 'Survivors', 'Sweden/epidemiology', 'Young Adult']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3931-4125'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We therefore performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the risk of second cancers associated with receipt of cisplatin-based chemotherapy in randomized controlled trials (RCTs). METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, trial registers, conference proceedings, review articles, and reference lists of trial publications for all relevant RCTs comparing cisplatin- versus non-cisplatin-containing chemotherapy with data on second cancers. We extracted data about study characteristics and second cancers, especially leukemia/ myelodysplasia. The primary and secondary outcomes were the odds ratios (ORs) for all second cancers and for secondary leukemia/ myelodysplasia, respectively. RESULTS: We identified 28 eligible trials with 7403 patients. Second cancers were reported in 143 patients, including 75 patients in the cisplatin arm and 68 in the non-cisplatin arm (raw event rates of 1.91 and 1.96%, respectively). The pooled OR for risk of all second cancers associated with cisplatin-based chemotherapy was 0.95 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.67-1.33, P = 0.76). Secondary leukemia/ myelodysplasia was reported in 14 patients on cisplatin arms and in 6 patients on non-cisplatin arms of 11 eligible RCTs with 2629 patients (raw event rates of 1.09 and 0.45%, respectively; pooled OR = 2.34, 95%CI 0.97-5.65, P = 0.06). CONCLUSION: Cisplatin was not associated with a significantly increased risk of second cancers compared with non-cisplatin-based chemotherapy. There is a non-significant trend to increased risk of leukemia/ myelodysplasia and the absolute risk was low. The concern about risk of second cancers should not influence decisions to use an efficacious regimen containing cisplatin.","['Liang, Fei', 'Zhang, Sheng', 'Xue, Hongxi', 'Chen, Qiang']","['Liang F', 'Zhang S', 'Xue H', 'Chen Q']","['Shanghai Cancer Center and Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', 'Shanghai Cancer Center and Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai, China. wozhangsheng@hotmail.com.', 'Medical Oncology, Shanghai Cancer Center, Fudan University, 270 Dongan Road, Shanghai, 200032, China. wozhangsheng@hotmail.com.', 'Rizhao City Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine, 35 Wanghai Road, Rizhao, China.', 'Department of clinical biochemistry, School of public health Taishan medical university, Taishan, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",20171219,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,PMC5738212,['NOTNLM'],"['Cisplatin', 'Randomized controlled trials', 'Second cancer']",2017/12/21 06:00,2018/07/24 06:00,['2017/12/21 06:00'],"['2016/12/31 00:00 [received]', '2017/12/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/12/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/12/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/07/24 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12885-017-3902-4 [doi]', '10.1186/s12885-017-3902-4 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2017 Dec 19;17(1):871. doi: 10.1186/s12885-017-3902-4.,20180723,1,['Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)'],IM,"['Cisplatin/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/*epidemiology/pathology', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/chemically induced/*epidemiology/pathology', 'Retrospective Studies']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Key signalling components of the senescence machinery, such as p16(INK4a), p21(CIP1) and p53, as well as trimethylation of lysine 9 at histone H3 (H3K9me3), also operate as critical regulators of stem-cell functions (which are collectively termed 'stemness'). In cancer cells, a gain of stemness may have profound implications for tumour aggressiveness and clinical outcome. Here we investigated whether chemotherapy-induced senescence could change stem-cell-related properties of malignant cells. Gene expression and functional analyses comparing senescent and non-senescent B-cell lymphomas from Emu-Myc transgenic mice revealed substantial upregulation of an adult tissue stem-cell signature, activated Wnt signalling, and distinct stem-cell markers in senescence. Using genetically switchable models of senescence targeting H3K9me3 or p53 to mimic spontaneous escape from the arrested condition, we found that cells released from senescence re-entered the cell cycle with strongly enhanced and Wnt-dependent clonogenic growth potential compared to virtually identical populations that had been equally exposed to chemotherapy but had never been senescent. In vivo, these previously senescent cells presented with a much higher tumour initiation potential. Notably, the temporary enforcement of senescence in p53-regulatable models of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and acute myeloid leukaemia was found to reprogram non-stem bulk leukaemia cells into self-renewing, leukaemia-initiating stem cells. Our data, which are further supported by consistent results in human cancer cell lines and primary samples of human haematological malignancies, reveal that senescence-associated stemness is an unexpected, cell-autonomous feature that exerts its detrimental, highly aggressive growth potential upon escape from cell-cycle blockade, and is enriched in relapse tumours. These findings have profound implications for cancer therapy, and provide new mechanistic insights into the plasticity of cancer cells.","['Milanovic, Maja', 'Fan, Dorothy N Y', 'Belenki, Dimitri', 'Dabritz, J Henry M', 'Zhao, Zhen', 'Yu, Yong', 'Dorr, Jan R', 'Dimitrova, Lora', 'Lenze, Dido', 'Monteiro Barbosa, Ines A', 'Mendoza-Parra, Marco A', 'Kanashova, Tamara', 'Metzner, Marlen', 'Pardon, Katharina', 'Reimann, Maurice', 'Trumpp, Andreas', 'Dorken, Bernd', 'Zuber, Johannes', 'Gronemeyer, Hinrich', 'Hummel, Michael', 'Dittmar, Gunnar', 'Lee, Soyoung', 'Schmitt, Clemens A']","['Milanovic M', 'Fan DNY', 'Belenki D', 'Dabritz JHM', 'Zhao Z', 'Yu Y', 'Dorr JR', 'Dimitrova L', 'Lenze D', 'Monteiro Barbosa IA', 'Mendoza-Parra MA', 'Kanashova T', 'Metzner M', 'Pardon K', 'Reimann M', 'Trumpp A', 'Dorken B', 'Zuber J', 'Gronemeyer H', 'Hummel M', 'Dittmar G', 'Lee S', 'Schmitt CA']","['Charite -

This survey utilizes P. ostreatus and doxorubicin hydrochloride (DOX) alone and then with hyperthermia to investigate the erythroleukemia cell line. This study evaluates and compares the apoptotic and necrotic effects of various treatments on the KG-1 cell line. Methods The proliferation of KG-1 cells was measured by using a tetrazolium salt (MTT)-based colorimetric assay during 96 h after treatment by gradient dilutions of 100 ng/mL to 100 mg/mL of P. ostreatus methanol extract and then the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined and was applied in additional experiments. Afterward, the cells were treated using P. ostreatus extract, DOX (6.95 mg/L), and hyperthermia (42 and 44 degrees C), separately and then applying hyperthermia. Finally, the ratios of apoptosis and necrosis after 24 h incubation were evaluated by using flow cytometry. Results The MIC of the extract was determined (1 mg/mL), which significantly increased the ratio of apoptosis rather than necrosis, whereas the DOX treatment primarily induced necrosis on the KG-1 cells. The anticancer effects of the mushroom extract were significantly increased when it was combined with thermotherapy, which exhibited apoptotic effects at 42 degrees C but induced necrosis at 44 degrees C. Conclusions The results suggest that P. ostreatus extract induces apoptosis on KG-1 cells and its anticancer effects are significantly increased in combination with thermotherapy. Therefore, P. ostreatus could be considered as an alternative with anticancer effect for further studies in erythroleukemia patients.","['Ebrahimi, Alireza', 'Atashi, Amir', 'Soleimani, Masoud', 'Mashhadikhan, Maedeh', 'Barahimi, Ahmadreza', 'Kaviani, Saeid']","['Ebrahimi A', 'Atashi A', 'Soleimani M', 'Mashhadikhan M', 'Barahimi A', 'Kaviani S']","['Department of Hematology, Faculty of Medical Sciences, Tarbiat Modares University, Tehran, Iran.', 'Stem Cells and Tissue Engineering Research Center, Shahroud University of Medical Sciences, Shahroud 3614773955, Iran.', 'Department of Hematology, Faculty of Medical Sciences, Tarbiat Modares University, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Biology, Faculty of Sciences, Tehran Sciences and Research Branch, Islamic Azad University, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Medical Mycology, Faculty of Medical Sciences, Tarbiat Modares University, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Hematology, Faculty of Medical Sciences, Tarbiat Modares University, Tehran, Iran.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20171219,Germany,J Complement Integr Med,Journal of complementary & integrative medicine,101313855,,['NOTNLM'],"['KG-1 cells', 'apoptosis', 'chemotherapy', 'herbal medicine', 'physical medicine']",2017/12/20 06:00,2018/10/04 06:00,['2017/12/20 06:00'],"['2017/02/28 00:00 [received]', '2017/10/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/12/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/04 06:00 [medline]', '2017/12/20 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1515/jcim-2016-0136 [doi]', '/j/jcim.ahead-of-print/jcim-2016-0136/jcim-2016-0136.xml [pii]']",epublish,J Complement Integr Med. 2017 Dec 19;15(2). pii: /j/jcim.ahead-of-print/jcim-2016-0136/jcim-2016-0136.xml. doi: 10.1515/jcim-2016-0136.,20181003,2,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biological Products)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis', 'Biological Products/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', '*Hyperthermia, Induced', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/drug therapy/*therapy', 'Necrosis', 'Phytotherapy', '*Pleurotus']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the role of the overexpression of FLT3 in leukemia remains to be fully elucidated. By mining public database, the present study first identified that the expression of FLT3 in leukemia was markedly higher, compared with that in other types of tumor and cell lines, indicating that FLT3 is important in leukemia. In leukemia, FLT3 was found to be significantly upregulated in acute myeloid leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and a high expression of FLT3 contributed to reduced survival rates. By analyzing Gene Expression Omnibus and The Cancer Genome Atlas data, it was found that genetic alterations and modification of DNA methylation increased the expression of FLT3 in leukemia. FLT3ITD and FLT3 tyrosine kinase domain point mutations increased the expression of FLT3 in four independent datasets. In addition, the status of FLT3 gene methylation was negatively correlated with the expression of FLT3, and haploinsufficiency of DNA methyltransferase 1 increased the expression of Flt3 in mouse leukemia cells. By analyzing the enrichment of differentiallyexpressed genes in chemical and genetic perturbation datasets, it was found that genes, which were upregulated in the FLT3 high expression group had myeloid lymphoid leukemia and nucleophosmin 1like signatures, indicating that the overexpression of FLT3 may use the same mechanism to promote leukemia. Collectively, the results of the present study showed that the overexpression of FLT3 is a potential risk factor in leukemia.","['Cheng, Jie', 'Qu, Lijun', 'Wang, Jian', 'Cheng, Lemei', 'Wang, Yi']","['Cheng J', 'Qu L', 'Wang J', 'Cheng L', 'Wang Y']","[""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Children's Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu 215025, P.R.

Multiple factors impact the decision to treat or which regimen to use at MM relapse/progression. Recent major randomized controlled trials (RCTs) showed widely varying progression-free survivals (PFS), ranging from a median of 4 months (MM-003) to 23.6 months (ASPIRE). Based on these RCTs, next-generation proteasome inhibitors (carfilzomib and ixazomib), next-generation immunomodulatory agent (pomalidomide), and monoclonal antibodies (elotuzumab and daratumumab) were approved for relapsed and refractory MM. Daratumumab, targeting CD38, has multiple mechanisms of action including modulation of the immunosuppressive bone marrow micro-environment. In addition to the remarkable single agent activity in refractory MM, daratumumab produced deep responses and superior PFS in MM when combined with lenalidomide/dexamethasone, or bortezomib/dexamethasone. Other anti-CD38 antibodies, such as isatuximab and MOR202, are undergoing assessment. Elotuzumab, targeting SLAMF7, yielded superior response rates and PFS when combined with lenalidomide/dexamethasone. New combinations of these next generation novel agents and/or antibodies are undergoing clinical trials. Venetoclax, an oral BH3 mimetic inhibiting BCL2, showed single agent activity in MM with t(11;14), and is being studied in combination with bortezomib/dexamethasone. Selinexor, an Exportin-1 inhibitor, yielded promising results in quad- or penta-refractory MM including patients resistant to daratumumab. Pembrolizumab, an anti-PD1 check-point inhibitor, is being tested in combination with lenalidomide/dexamethasone or pomalidomide/dexamethasone. Chimeric antigen receptor-T cells targeting B-cell maturation antigen have yielded deep responses in RRMM. Finally, salvage autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) remains an important treatment in MM relapsing/progressing after a first ASCT. Herein, the clinical trial data of these agents are summarized, cautious interpretation of RCTs highlighted, and algorithm for salvage treatment of relapse/refractory MM proposed.","['Chim, C S', 'Kumar, S K', 'Orlowski, R Z', 'Cook, G', 'Richardson, P G', 'Gertz, M A', 'Giralt, S', 'Mateos, M V', 'Leleu, X', 'Anderson, K C']","['Chim CS', 'Kumar SK', 'Orlowski RZ', 'Cook G', 'Richardson PG', 'Gertz MA', 'Giralt S', 'Mateos MV', 'Leleu X', 'Anderson KC']","['Department of Medicine, Queen Mary Hospital, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong.', 'Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic at Rochester, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Department of Lymphoma/Myeloma, Division of Cancer Medicine, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Haematology & Myeloma Studies, Section of Experimental Haematology, Leeds Institute of Cancer and Pathology, University of Leeds, Leeds, UK.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic at Rochester, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, USA.', 'Department of Haematology, University Hospital of Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Hopital La Mileterie, part of the Academic Hospital of Poitiers (CHU), France.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.']",['eng'],"['P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA186781/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Review']",20171116,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,PMC5808071,,,2017/12/20 06:00,2019/01/03 06:00,['2017/12/20 06:00'],"['2017/08/02 00:00 [received]', '2017/10/09 00:00 [revised]', '2017/11/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/12/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/03 06:00 [medline]', '2017/12/20 06:00 [entrez]']","['leu2017329 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2017.329 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2018 Feb;32(2):252-262. doi: 10.1038/leu.2017.329.

Oncogenic driver mutations in PMF include Janus kinase 2, calreticulin (CALR), and myeloproliferative leukemia virus oncogene. These mutations are not only pathogenetically relevant but might also influence disease outcome. Our objective for the current communication is to comprehensively review the distinct phenotypic, therapeutic, and prognostic implications of driver mutations in PMF. RECENT FINDINGS: The discovery of driver mutations has revolutionized our understanding of pathogenic mechanisms and clinical heterogeneity in MPN, including PMF. Recently, there have been further advances in our knowledge of the molecular pathogenesis of MPN, particularly pertaining to CALR and its mutation. Moreover, the type and number of additional mutations, their order of acquisition, and their myriad combinatorial interactions with driver mutations may have dynamic pathogenic and clinical consequences. There are also additional data supporting the role of these genetic lesions and their associated allele burdens in modulating clinical features, including outcomes following treatment. SUMMARY: Literature exists to support both phenotypic and prognostic correlates of conventional driver mutations in PMF. As the genetic landscape becomes increasingly complex, establishing the functional impact of these mutations and defining their interactions with other molecular, cytogenetic, and extrinsic factors will further our insight and potentially alter our clinical approach.","['Szuber, Natasha', 'Tefferi, Ayalew']","['Szuber N', 'Tefferi A']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,,,,2017/12/20 06:00,2019/01/12 06:00,['2017/12/20 06:00'],"['2017/12/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/12 06:00 [medline]', '2017/12/20 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/MOH.0000000000000406 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2018 Mar;25(2):129-135. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0000000000000406.,20190111,2,"['0 (BCR-ABL1 fusion protein, human)', '0 (CALR protein, human)', '0 (Calreticulin)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Calreticulin/*genetics', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/diagnosis/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/*genetics', '*Mutation', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/diagnosis/*genetics/metabolism', 'Prognosis']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The retrospective cohort study was conducted at the National Institute of Blood Diseases and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Karachi, and comprised of medical record of acute myeloid leukaemia patients from March 2006 to October 2016. Data noted age at presentation, gender, medical history, physical examination, blood and bone marrow investigations such as, haemoglobin levels, blood cell count myeloperoxidase activity, periodic acid-Schiff and reticulin staining as well as final diagnosis. Comparison, where possible, was done with contemporary literature. SPSS 19 was used for data analysis. RESULTS: Of the 626 subjects, 248(39.6%) were females and 378(60.4%) males. The overall mean age was 35.3+/-17.1 years. The most common age group was 15-40 years with 354(56.5%) patients. The most common subtype was acute myeloid leukaemia with maturation 183(33.6%). Myeloperoxidase activity was positive for the majority of the acute myeloid leukaemia patients. Periodic acid-Schiff test, done on only selected patients, was mostly negative. Reticulin staining was positive for 113(65.3%) patients. The most common presenting complaints were fever 266(71.9%) and weakness 168(45.4%). Mean haemoglobin and red blood cell count were 8.3 +/- 2.4 g/dL and 2.9 +/- 1.2 1012/L, respectively.

Recent studies suggest that, rather than completely destroying a protein, caspase cleavage can confer novel characteristics or functions. In this respect, the post-caspase role of Bcl-2 family proteins remains uncharacterized. Here, we showed that Mcl-1, a pro-survival member of the Bcl-2 family, was cleaved by caspase-3 in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells undergoing chemotherapeutic agent-triggered apoptosis. Caspase cleavage partially impaired the anti-apoptotic activity of Mcl-1 by reducing its mitochondrial localization and impeding its association with the permeability transition pore-forming protein Bak. However, the stability of cleaved Mcl-1 was markedly enhanced because it was more refractory to ubiquitination-dependent proteasomal degradation, thereby improving cell viability to a greater extent than full-length Mcl-1 when transiently expressed in NSCLC cells. These findings shed new light on the role of Mcl-1 in apoptosis and suggest potential novel targets for optimizing the tumoricidal capacity of chemotherapy.","['Wang, Ting', 'Yang, Zhiwei', 'Zhang, Yimeng', 'Zhang, Xiang', 'Wang, Lei', 'Zhang, Shengli', 'Jia, Lintao']","['Wang T', 'Yang Z', 'Zhang Y', 'Zhang X', 'Wang L', 'Zhang S', 'Jia L']","[""State Key Laboratory of Cancer Biology, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an, 710032, China."", ""Department of Applied Physics, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, 710049, China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Cancer Biology, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an, 710032, China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Cancer Biology, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an, 710032, China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Cancer Biology, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an, 710032, China."", ""Department of Applied Physics, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, 710049, China. zhangsl@mail.xjtu.edu.cn."", ""State Key Laboratory of Cancer Biology, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an, 710032, China. jialth@fmmu.edu.cn.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Apoptosis,Apoptosis : an international journal on programmed cell death,9712129,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Bak', '*Chemotherapy', '*Lung cancer', '*Mcl-1', '*Proteasomal degradation']",2017/12/20 06:00,2019/08/29 06:00,['2017/12/20 06:00'],"['2017/12/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/29 06:00 [medline]', '2017/12/20 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s10495-017-1436-5 [doi]', '10.1007/s10495-017-1436-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Apoptosis. 2018 Jan;23(1):54-64. doi: 10.1007/s10495-017-1436-5.,20190828,1,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BAK1 protein, human)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein)', '15H5577CQD (Docetaxel)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Binding Sites', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Caspase 3/*chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cisplatin/pharmacology', 'Docetaxel/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/metabolism', 'Molecular Docking Simulation', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Conformation, alpha-Helical', 'Protein Conformation, beta-Strand', 'Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs', 'Proteolysis', 'bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein/*chemistry/genetics/metabolism']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nevertheless, it remains unclear whether bronchoscopy with BAL leads to changes in medical management or is associated with procedural complications among critically ill acute leukemia (AL) patients. METHODS: We evaluated 71 AL patients who underwent diagnostic bronchoscopy with BAL in the intensive care unit (ICU) between 1 January 2007 and 31 December 2012. We recorded baseline characteristics, vital signs (before, during, and after the procedure), changes in medical management following the procedure, and procedural complications. Using a multivariable logistic regression model, we explored the relationship between patient characteristics and whether bronchoscopy changed management or caused complications. Patient characteristics included as predictors in the regression model were age, sex, immunosuppression status (those undergoing active chemotherapy), and the Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation II score. RESULTS: The most common indication for ICU admission was respiratory failure (51 patients, 72%), followed by sepsis (14 patients, 20%). Overall, the results obtained from bronchoscopy with BAL were associated with a change in management in 32 patients (45%), most commonly a change in antimicrobial therapy as a result of an infectious pathogen being identified (17 patients, 24%). Complications were documented in nine patients (13%) and included post-procedural hypoxia (six patients, 8%), the need for intubation (one patient, 9% of non-intubated patients), and tracheal perforation (one patient, 1%). No clinically significant changes in patient vital signs were observed during or immediately following the procedure. Patient characteristics did not predict whether bronchoscopy was associated with changes in medical management or procedural complications in multivariable analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Flexible bronchoscopy with BAL is relatively safe and helps to guide medical management among patients with AL admitted to the ICU.","['Deotare, Uday', 'Merman, Erica', 'Pincus, Daniel', 'Kraguljac, Alan P', 'Croucher, Danielle', 'Kumar, Vikram', 'Ibrahimova, Narmin', 'Minden, Mark D', 'Lee, Christie', 'Mehta, Sangeeta']","['Deotare U', 'Merman E', 'Pincus D', 'Kraguljac AP', 'Croucher D', 'Kumar V', 'Ibrahimova N', 'Minden MD', 'Lee C', 'Mehta S']","['Leukemia Program, Department of Medical Oncology and Hematology, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada. erica.merman@utoronto.ca.', 'Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto, 500 University Avenue, Suite 602, Toronto, ON, M5G 1V7, Canada. erica.merman@utoronto.ca.', 'Department of Surgery, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Leukemia Program, Department of Medical Oncology and Hematology, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Leukemia Program, Department of Medical Oncology and Hematology, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Medicine & Interdepartmental Division of Critical Care, Mount Sinai Hospital, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Medicine & Interdepartmental Division of Critical Care, Mount Sinai Hospital, Toronto, ON, Canada.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20171218,United States,Can J Anaesth,Canadian journal of anaesthesia = Journal canadien d'anesthesie,8701709,,,,2017/12/20 06:00,2019/08/01 06:00,['2017/12/20 06:00'],"['2017/09/12 00:00 [received]', '2017/12/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/12/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/01 06:00 [medline]', '2017/12/20 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12630-017-1041-7 [doi]', '10.1007/s12630-017-1041-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Can J Anaesth. 2018 Mar;65(3):272-279. doi: 10.1007/s12630-017-1041-7.

A significantly lower rate of complete remissions, higher early mortality, higher relapse rate and poorer survival is observed in older compared with younger ALL patients. Most importantly, intensive chemotherapy with or without stem-cell transplantation is less well tolerated in older patients. In addition, there is an increasing incidence of poor prognostic factors with increasing age. Progress has been made with the development of age-adapted, moderately intensive chemotherapy protocols for Ph/BCR-ABL-negative ALL and combinations of tyrosine kinase inhibitors with chemotherapy in Ph/BCR-ABL-positive ALL. Future progress can be expected from new targeted therapies, particularly novel immunotherapies, moderately intensified consolidation strategies and reduced intensity stem-cell transplantation. For this purpose, prospective clinical trials for older patients are urgently needed.","['Gokbuget, Nicola']",['Gokbuget N'],"['Department of Medicine II, Goethe University Hospital, Theodor Stern Kai 7, 60590, Frankfurt, Germany. goekbuget@em.uni-frankfurt.de.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,New Zealand,Drugs Aging,Drugs & aging,9102074,,,,2017/12/20 06:00,2018/08/04 06:00,['2017/12/20 06:00'],"['2017/12/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/08/04 06:00 [medline]', '2017/12/20 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s40266-017-0503-5 [doi]', '10.1007/s40266-017-0503-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Drugs Aging. 2018 Jan;35(1):11-26. doi: 10.1007/s40266-017-0503-5.,20180803,1,,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Prospective Studies', 'Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In recent Total Therapy studies conducted at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, children with ALL had a 5-year overall survival of around 94%. This is the result of a combination of risk stratification based on the biological features of the leukemic cells and the response to treatment (as assessed by the detection of minimal residual disease), treatment modification based on pharmacodynamic and pharmacogenomic data, and improved supportive care. However, innovative approaches are required to further improve survival to as close to 100% as possible and to reduce the adverse effects of treatment. Next-generation sequencing of leukemic cell DNA and RNA, as well as of germline DNA, can identify submicroscopic genetic structural changes and sequence alterations that contribute to leukemogenesis. Next-generation sequencing data can be used to define new ALL subtypes, to help improve treatment response and reduce adverse effects, and to identify novel prognostic markers and therapeutic targets to facilitate personalized precision medicine. In this article, we describe our approach to detecting targetable lesions in patients with ALL by next-generation sequencing and explain how we integrate the sequencing data into the treatment of these patients.","['Inaba, Hiroto', 'Azzato, Elizabeth M', 'Mullighan, Charles G']","['Inaba H', 'Azzato EM', 'Mullighan CG']","[""Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, United States."", ""Department of Pathology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, United States."", ""Department of Pathology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, United States.""]",['eng'],"['P30 CA021765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 GM115279/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R35 CA197695/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['Journal Article'],20171204,Switzerland,Front Pediatr,Frontiers in pediatrics,101615492,PMC5722984,['NOTNLM'],"['Philadelphia chromosome-like leukemia', 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'early T-cell precursor', 'molecularly targeted therapy', 'next-generation sequencing']",2017/12/20 06:00,2017/12/20 06:01,['2017/12/20 06:00'],"['2017/08/08 00:00 [received]', '2017/11/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/12/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/12/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/20 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fped.2017.00258 [doi]'],epublish,Front Pediatr. 2017 Dec 4;5:258. doi: 10.3389/fped.2017.00258. eCollection 2017.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The genetic underpinnings of disease formation and progression remain incompletely understood. Large-scale human population studies have identified a high frequency of potential driver mutations in spliceosomal and epigenetic regulators that contribute to malignancies, such as myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and leukemias. The high conservation of cell types and genes between humans and model organisms permits the investigation of the underlying mechanisms of leukemic development and potential therapeutic testing in genetically pliable pre-clinical systems. Due to the many technical advantages, such as large-scale screening, lineage-tracing studies, tumor transplantation, and high-throughput drug screening approaches, zebrafish is emerging as a model system for myeloid malignancies.

CB helps to eliminate heat and toxic components, and prevents the accumulation of phlegm and blood stasis in the liver. In Asian countries, CB Sativus (CBS), an ideal substitute for natural CB, is presently extensively used for long-term treatment of chronic liver diseases. The present study aimed to evaluate the effects and potential mechanism(s) of action of CBS on mice with fructose-induced nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The NAFLD model was established in C57BL/6 mice by exclusively feeding fluids containing 30% fructose for 8 consecutive weeks. After these 8 weeks, mice were given CBS (50 mg/kg/day or 100 mg/kg/day) for 2 consecutive weeks. Treatment with CBS reversed the fructose-induced impaired glucose tolerance. Compared with the model group, in which mice received 8 weeks of high-fructose diet and 2 weeks of 0.5% sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, CBS treatment significantly decreased the levels of fasting serum glucose, fasting insulin, triglyceride, and total cholesterol, and increased levels of high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol. CBS treatment also significantly decreased the levels of triglyceride, total cholesterol, and free fatty acid in the liver. The activity of superoxide dismutase in the liver was increased after treatment with CBS, however, levels of malondialdehyde and reactive oxygen species decreased. Histopathological examination showed that liver steatosis and injury were significantly reduced in CBS-treated mice. The expression of fatty acid synthase, nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells, Cysteinyl aspartate-specific proteinase-3, and synonyms B-cell leukemia/lymphoma-2 gene-associated X protein were downregulated after treatment with CBS, whereas the expression of nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 was upregulated. In conclusion, CBS treatment exerted therapeutic effects in the liver of mice with NAFLD, which may be associated with amelioration of metabolic disorders, enhanced antioxidant effects, and alleviation of apoptosis.","['He, Wenxi', 'Xu, Yanjiao', 'Zhang, Chengliang', 'Lu, Jingli', 'Li, Juan', 'Xiang, Dong', 'Yang, Jinyu', 'Chang, Mujun', 'Liu, Dong']","['He W', 'Xu Y', 'Zhang C', 'Lu J', 'Li J', 'Xiang D', 'Yang J', 'Chang M', 'Liu D']","['Department of Pharmacy, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Center for Translational Medicine, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20171205,New Zealand,Drug Des Devel Ther,"Drug design, development and therapy",101475745,PMC5723121,['NOTNLM'],"['antioxidant', 'fructose', 'lipid metabolism', 'liver']",2017/12/20 06:00,2018/07/24 06:00,['2017/12/20 06:00'],"['2017/12/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/12/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/07/24 06:00 [medline]']","['10.2147/DDDT.S150187 [doi]', 'dddt-11-3449 [pii]']",epublish,Drug Des Devel Ther. 2017 Dec 5;11:3449-3460. doi: 10.2147/DDDT.S150187. eCollection 2017.,20180723,,"['0 (Drugs, Chinese Herbal)', '30237-26-4 (Fructose)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drugs, Chinese Herbal/administration & dosage/chemistry/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Fructose/adverse effects', 'Glucose Intolerance', 'Hepatocytes/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Male', 'Medicine, Chinese Traditional', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Oxidative Stress/*drug effects']",,,['Disclosure The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The severity of pancytopenia and the underlying pathology determine the management and prognosis. This study was conducted to evaluate hematological and bone marrow findings in patients presenting with pancytopenia. METHODS: A prospective observational study was conducted in Department of Pathology, Manipal College of Medical Sciences, Pokhara from January 2011 to December 2016. Clinical and hematological parameters including bone marrow aspiration and biopsy were evaluated in all patients who presented with pancytopenia. RESULTS: Among 138 cases studied, patients' age ranged from 2 to 82 years with a mean age of 43.95 years, and there was male predominance. Most of the patients presented with generalized weakness, pallor, dypnoea and fever. Hypoplastic marrow was seen in 38 (27.5%) cases, followed by 26 (18.8%) cases of megaloblastic anemia and 19 (13.76%) cases of acute leukemia. Other findings included one case each of hemophagocyosis, leishmaniasis, plasmodium vivex malaria and metastatic carcinoma. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights that pancytopenia is a common hematological problem and that the study of detailed primary hematological investigations along with bone marrow study in patients with pancytopenia will help to identify the cause for further planning and management.","['Ghartimagar, Dilasma', 'Ghosh, Arnab', 'Thapa, Sushma', 'Sapkota, Deepa', 'Jhunjhunwala, Adarsh Kumar', 'Narasimhan, Raghavan', 'Talwar, O P']","['Ghartimagar D', 'Ghosh A', 'Thapa S', 'Sapkota D', 'Jhunjhunwala AK', 'Narasimhan R', 'Talwar OP']","['Department of Pathology, Manipal College of Medical Science, Pokhara, Nepal.', 'Department of Pathology, Manipal College of Medical Science, Pokhara, Nepal.', 'Department of Pathology, Manipal College of Medical Science, Pokhara, Nepal.', 'Department of Pathology, Manipal College of Medical Science, Pokhara, Nepal.', 'Department of Pathology, Manipal College of Medical Science, Pokhara, Nepal.', 'Department of Pathology, Manipal College of Medical Science, Pokhara, Nepal.', 'Department of Pathology, Manipal College of Medical Science, Pokhara, Nepal.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Observational Study']",,Nepal,JNMA J Nepal Med Assoc,JNMA; journal of the Nepal Medical Association,0045233,,['NOTNLM'],['*hypoplastic marrow; leukemia; megaloblastic anemia; pancytopenia.'],2017/12/20 06:00,2019/03/13 06:00,['2017/12/20 06:00'],"['2017/12/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/12/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/13 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,JNMA J Nepal Med Assoc. 2017 Jul-Sep;56(207):319-24.,20190312,207,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Anemia, Megaloblastic/blood/complications/pathology/*physiopathology', 'Anorexia/etiology/physiopathology', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dyspnea/etiology/physiopathology', 'Fever/etiology/physiopathology', 'Hemorrhage/etiology/physiopathology', 'Hepatomegaly/etiology/physiopathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/blood/complications/pathology/*physiopathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Muscle Weakness/etiology/physiopathology', 'Nepal', 'Pallor/etiology/physiopathology', 'Pancytopenia/blood/complications/pathology/*physiopathology', 'Prospective Studies', 'Splenomegaly/etiology/physiopathology', 'Tertiary Care Centers', 'Young Adult']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We performed targeted sequencing in a cohort of 27 probands with a clinical diagnosis of Kabuki syndrome. Of these, 12 had causative variants in the two known Kabuki syndrome genes. In 2, we identified presumptive loss of function de novo variants in KMT2A (missense and splice site variants), a gene that encodes another histone modifying enzyme previously exclusively associated with Wiedermann-Steiner syndrome. Although Kabuki syndrome is a disorder of histone modification, we also find alterations in DNA methylation among individuals with a Kabuki syndrome diagnosis relative to matched normal controls, regardless of whether they carry a variant in KMT2A or KMT2D or not. Furthermore, we observed characteristic global abnormalities of DNA methylation that distinguished patients with a loss of function variant in KMT2D or missense or splice site variants in either KMT2D or KMT2A from normal controls. Our results provide new insights into the relationship of genotype to epigenotype and phenotype and indicate cross-talk between histone and DNA methylation machineries exposed by inborn errors of the epigenetic apparatus.","['Sobreira, Nara', 'Brucato, Martha', 'Zhang, Li', 'Ladd-Acosta, Christine', 'Ongaco, Chrissie', 'Romm, Jane', 'Doheny, Kimberly F', 'Mingroni-Netto, Regina C', 'Bertola, Debora', 'Kim, Chong A', 'Perez, Ana Ba', 'Melaragno, Maria I', 'Valle, David', 'Meloni, Vera A', 'Bjornsson, Hans T']","['Sobreira N', 'Brucato M', 'Zhang L', 'Ladd-Acosta C', 'Ongaco C', 'Romm J', 'Doheny KF', 'Mingroni-Netto RC', 'Bertola D', 'Kim CA', 'Perez AB', 'Melaragno MI', 'Valle D', 'Meloni VA', 'Bjornsson HT']","['McKusick-Nathans Institute of Genetic Medicine, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'Department of Epidemiology, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'McKusick-Nathans Institute of Genetic Medicine, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'Department of Epidemiology, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'Center for Inherited Disease Research (CIDR), Institute of Genetic Medicine, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'Center for Inherited Disease Research (CIDR), Institute of Genetic Medicine, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'Center for Inherited Disease Research (CIDR), Institute of Genetic Medicine, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'Departamento de Genetica e Biologia Evolutiva, Instituto de Biociencias, Universidade de Sao Paulo, Rua do Matao, 277, Sao Paulo, CEP 05508-090, Brazil.', 'Unidade de Genetica, Instituto da Crianca, Hospital das Clinicas da Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Unidade de Genetica, Instituto da Crianca, Hospital das Clinicas da Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Genetics Division, Department of Morphology and Genetics, Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Genetics Division, Department of Morphology and Genetics, Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'McKusick-Nathans Institute of Genetic Medicine, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'Unidade de Genetica, Instituto da Crianca, Hospital das Clinicas da Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'McKusick-Nathans Institute of Genetic Medicine, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA. hbjorns1@jhmi.edu.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA. hbjorns1@jhmi.edu.', 'Faculty of Medicine, University of Iceland, Reykjavik, Iceland. hbjorns1@jhmi.edu.']",['eng'],"['U54 HG006493/HG/NHGRI NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 HD079123/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM007814/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM007309/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 HG006542/HG/NHGRI NIH HHS/United States', 'UM1 HG006542/HG/NHGRI NIH HHS/United States', 'DP5 OD017877/OD/NIH HHS/United States']",['Journal Article'],20171107,England,Eur J Hum Genet,European journal of human genetics : EJHG,9302235,PMC5865196,,,2017/12/20 06:00,2018/07/24 06:00,['2017/12/20 06:00'],"['2017/04/20 00:00 [received]', '2017/09/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/09/20 00:00 [revised]', '2017/12/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/12/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/07/24 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41431-017-0023-0 [doi]', '10.1038/s41431-017-0023-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Eur J Hum Genet. 2017 Dec;25(12):1335-1344. doi: 10.1038/s41431-017-0023-0.

Recently, haploidentical HCT is gaining interest because of better outcomes with post-transplantation cyclophosphamide (PTCY). We analyzed patients with CLL who received an allogeneic HCT with a haploidentical donor and whose data were available in the EBMT registry. In total 117 patients (74% males) were included; 38% received PTCY as GVHD prophylaxis. For the whole study cohort OS at 2 and 5 yrs was 48 and 38%, respectively. PFS at 2 and 5 yrs was 38 and 31%, respectively. Cumulative incidence (CI) of NRM in the whole group at 2 and 5 years were 40 and 44%, respectively. CI of relapse at 2 and 5 yrs were 22 and 26%, respectively. All outcomes were not statistically different in patients who received PTCY compared to other types of GVHD prophylaxis. In conclusion, results of haploidentical HCT in CLL seem almost identical to those with HLA-matched donors. Thereby, haploidentical HCT is an appropriate alternative in high risk CLL patients with a transplant indication but no available HLA-matched donor.

In clinical trials in relatively healthy younger patients, ibrutinib has been well tolerated. As its use has become more widespread in the community, however, its full adverse event profile has emerged and proven more challenging than was initially anticipated. Reports of community-based use have estimated discontinuation rates as high as 40% in the first year of therapy. This article therefore reviews my approach to the evaluation and management of a CLL patient starting on ibrutinib, with the goal of minimizing and managing toxicity to maintain patients on ibrutinib.

MRD was measured in peripheral blood (PB) from treatment-naive patients in the CLL8, CLL10, and CLL11 clinical trials, and quantified by 4-color flow cytometry or allele-specific oligonucleotide real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. A meta-regression model was developed to predict treatment effect on PFS using treatment effect on PB-MRD. PB-MRD levels were measured in 393, 337, and 474 patients from CLL8, CLL10, and CLL11, respectively. The model demonstrated a statistically significant relationship between treatment effect on PB-MRD and treatment effect on PFS. As the difference between treatment arms in PB-MRD response rates increased, a reduction in the risk of progression or death was observed; for each unit increase in the (log) ratio of MRD(-) rates between arms, the log of the PFS hazard ratio decreased by -0.188 (95% confidence interval, -0.321 to -0.055; P = .008). External model validation on the REACH trial and sensitivity analyses confirm the robustness and applicability of the surrogacy model. Our surrogacy model supports use of PB-MRD as a primary end point in randomized clinical trials of chemoimmunotherapy in CLL. Additional CLL trial data are required to establish a more precise quantitative relationship between MRD and PFS, and to support general applicability of MRD surrogacy for PFS across diverse patient characteristics, treatment regimens, and different treatment mechanisms of action.","['Dimier, Natalie', 'Delmar, Paul', 'Ward, Carol', 'Morariu-Zamfir, Rodica', 'Fingerle-Rowson, Gunter', 'Bahlo, Jasmin', 'Fischer, Kirsten', 'Eichhorst, Barbara', 'Goede, Valentin', 'van Dongen, Jacques J M', 'Ritgen, Matthias', 'Bottcher, Sebastian', 'Langerak, Anton W', 'Kneba, Michael', 'Hallek, Michael']","['Dimier N', 'Delmar P', 'Ward C', 'Morariu-Zamfir R', 'Fingerle-Rowson G', 'Bahlo J', 'Fischer K', 'Eichhorst B', 'Goede V', 'van Dongen JJM', 'Ritgen M', 'Bottcher S', 'Langerak AW', 'Kneba M', 'Hallek M']","['Roche Products Ltd, Welwyn, United Kingdom.', 'F.

MLL1 gene fuses with partner genes that results in the generation of MLL1 fusion proteins (MLL1-FPs), which are frequently detected in acute leukemia. In the progress of leukemogenesis, a great deal of proteins cooperate with MLL1 to form multiprotein complexes serving for the dysregulation of H3K4 methylation, the overexpression of homeobox (HOX) cluster genes, and the consequent generation of leukemia. Hence, disrupting the interactions between MLL1 and the reciprocal proteins has been considered to be a new treatment strategy for leukemia. Here, we reviewed potential protein-protein interactions (PPIs) between MLL1 and its reciprocal proteins, and summarized the inhibitors to target MLL1 PPIs. The druggability of MLL1 PPIs for leukemia were also discussed.","['Wang, Zhi-Hui', 'Li, Dong-Dong', 'Chen, Wei-Lin', 'You, Qi-Dong', 'Guo, Xiao-Ke']","['Wang ZH', 'Li DD', 'Chen WL', 'You QD', 'Guo XK']","['State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines and Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Drug Design and Optimization, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing 210009, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines and Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Drug Design and Optimization, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing 210009, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines and Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Drug Design and Optimization, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing 210009, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines and Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Drug Design and Optimization, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing 210009, China; Department of Medicinal Chemistry, School of Pharmacy, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing 210009, China.

However, miR-10 expression and its clinical implication in AML remain poorly defined. Although a recent report showed high serum level of miR-10a was associated with adverse prognosis in AML, herein, we found bone marrow (BM) miR-10 overexpression was not a prognostic biomarker in AML. METHODS: BM miR-10 expression was examined by real-time quantitative PCR in BM mononuclear cells in 115 de novo AML patients and 45 controls. RESULTS: BM miR-10 (miR-10a/b) expression was significantly up-regulated in AML patients, and was positively correlated with each other. Overexpression of miR-10a was associated with lower percentage of BM blasts, whereas miR-10b overexpression tended to correlate with higher percentage of BM blasts. Importantly, miR-10a overexpression was significantly associated with FAB-M3/t(15;17) subtypes and NPM1 mutation, meanwhile, overexpression of miR-10b was correlated with NPM1 and DNMT3A mutations. However, miR-10a/b overexpression was not associated with complete remission rate, and did not have an impact on both leukemia free survival and overall survival time in non-M3 AML patients without NPM1 mutation. CONCLUSIONS: BM miR-10 overexpression is associated with genetic events but not affects clinical outcome in AML.","['Zhang, Ting-Juan', 'Guo, Hong', 'Zhou, Jing-Dong', 'Li, Xi-Xi', 'Zhang, Wei', 'Ma, Ji-Chun', 'Wen, Xiang-Mei', 'Yao, Xin-Yu', 'Lin, Jiang', 'Qian, Jun']","['Zhang TJ', 'Guo H', 'Zhou JD', 'Li XX', 'Zhang W', 'Ma JC', 'Wen XM', 'Yao XY', 'Lin J', 'Qian J']","[""Department of Hematology, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China; The Key Lab of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment of Zhenjiang City, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China; School of Medicine, Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Laboratory Center, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China; The Key Lab of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment of Zhenjiang City, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China; The Key Lab of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment of Zhenjiang City, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China; School of Medicine, Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China; The Key Lab of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment of Zhenjiang City, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China; School of Medicine, Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China; The Key Lab of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment of Zhenjiang City, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Laboratory Center, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China; The Key Lab of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment of Zhenjiang City, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Laboratory Center, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China; The Key Lab of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment of Zhenjiang City, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China; School of Medicine, Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Laboratory Center, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China; The Key Lab of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment of Zhenjiang City, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China.

Cyclin D1 immunostaining in CLL/SLL may lead to diagnostic confusion. The objective of this study was to identify the types of stained cells and the impact on diagnosis. METHODS: Cyclin D1 expression was assessed by immunostaining samples from 46 cases of CLL/SLL. CD68 and double immunostaining with CD20/CyclinD1, CD68/CyclinD1, and CD163/CyclinD1 were then performed in cases of CLL/SLL positive for cyclinD1 in the PCs. RESULTS: Dim-positive cyclin D1 staining in randomly scattered cells in the CLL/SLLs were observed in 38/46 cases (82.6%). In five (10.9%) cases, more than 50 cyclin D1-positive cells per high-power field were detected within the PCs in CLL/SLL with weak to moderate intensity. Double immunochemical staining in these cases showed that cyclin D1 in these positive cells was mostly co-expressed with CD68 and CD163 and the cells were negative for CD20. CONCLUSIONS: The cyclin D1-positive CLL/SLL cells in this study were mostly histiocytes. The expression of cyclin D1 by histiocytes may mimic cyclin D1+ CLL/SLL; thus, the recognition of cyclin D1 expression by non-lymphoid cells in lymphoma is important.","['Wu, Jianghua', 'Zhang, Yanhui', 'Sun, Lin', 'Zhai, Qiongli']","['Wu J', 'Zhang Y', 'Sun L', 'Zhai Q']","[""Department of Pathology, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, National Clinical Research Center of Cancer, Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy, Tianjin' Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Tianjin, China."", ""Department of Pathology, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, National Clinical Research Center of Cancer, Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy, Tianjin' Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Tianjin, China."", ""Department of Pathology, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, National Clinical Research Center of Cancer, Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy, Tianjin' Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Tianjin, China."", ""Department of Pathology, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, National Clinical Research Center of Cancer, Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy, Tianjin' Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Tianjin, China.

In the present research, the interplay of BCL-2, total oxidative status (TOS) and LDH was investigated in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The studied parameters, BCL-2 protein (p less than 0.001), TOS (p less than 0.001) and LDH (p less than 0.001) were significantly elevated in the ALL group compared to the normal group (N-group). However, the total antioxidant status (TAS) was reduced significantly (p less than 0.01) in ALL patients. In the ALL group, the TOS had significant negative correlation with TAS (p less than 0.01). Furthermore, non-significant positive correlations were found between BCL-2 and LDH, BCL-2 and TAS and LDH and TAS (each with; p>0.05).

Pre-leukaemic clones carrying ETV6-RUNX1 oncogenic lesions are frequently found in neonatal cord blood, but only few ETV6-RUNX1 carriers develop pB-ALL. The highly demanding and pending challenge is to reveal the multistep natural history of ETV6-RUNX1 pB-ALL, because it can offer non-toxic prophylactic interventions to preleukemic carriers. However, the lack of a genetically engineered ETV6-RUNX1 mouse model mimicking the human pB-ALL has hampered our understanding of the pathogenesis of this disease. This rule has now been broken in a study of the effect of the ETV6-RUNX1 oncogene in cancer development in a mouse model in which oncogene expression is restricted to the stem cell compartment. In this article, we review the different attempts to model this disease, including the recent representative success stories and we discuss its potential application to both identify etiologic factors of childhood ETV6-RUNX1 pB-ALL and prevent the conversion of a preleukemic clone in an irreversible transformed state.","['Rodriguez-Hernandez, Guillermo', 'Schafer, Daniel', 'Gavilan, Ana', 'Vicente-Duenas, Carolina', 'Hauer, Julia', 'Borkhardt, Arndt', 'Sanchez-Garcia, Isidro']","['Rodriguez-Hernandez G', 'Schafer D', 'Gavilan A', 'Vicente-Duenas C', 'Hauer J', 'Borkhardt A', 'Sanchez-Garcia I']","['Experimental Therapeutics and Translational Oncology Program, Instituto de Biologia Molecular y Celular del Cancer, CSIC/ Universidad de Salamanca, Campus M. de Unamuno s/n, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Institute of Biomedical Research of Salamanca (IBSAL), Salamanca, Spain.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Clinical Immunology, Heinrich-Heine University Dusseldorf, Medical Faculty, Dusseldorf, Germany.', 'Experimental Therapeutics and Translational Oncology Program, Instituto de Biologia Molecular y Celular del Cancer, CSIC/ Universidad de Salamanca, Campus M. de Unamuno s/n, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Institute of Biomedical Research of Salamanca (IBSAL), Salamanca, Spain.', 'Institute of Biomedical Research of Salamanca (IBSAL), Salamanca, Spain.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Clinical Immunology, Heinrich-Heine University Dusseldorf, Medical Faculty, Dusseldorf, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Clinical Immunology, Heinrich-Heine University Dusseldorf, Medical Faculty, Dusseldorf, Germany.', 'Experimental Therapeutics and Translational Oncology Program, Instituto de Biologia Molecular y Celular del Cancer, CSIC/ Universidad de Salamanca, Campus M. de Unamuno s/n, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Institute of Biomedical Research of Salamanca (IBSAL), Salamanca, Spain.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20170927,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,PMC5731989,['NOTNLM'],"['GEMM', 'childhood leukemia', 'epigenetic modulation', 'infection exposure', 'mutational pattern']",2017/12/20 06:00,2017/12/20 06:01,['2017/12/20 06:00'],"['2017/07/12 00:00 [received]', '2017/09/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/12/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/12/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/20 06:01 [medline]']","['10.18632/oncotarget.21281 [doi]', '21281 [pii]']",epublish,Oncotarget. 2017 Sep 27;8(60):102674-102680. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.21281. eCollection 2017 Nov 24.,,60,,,,,,['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST The authors declare no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we characterized the molecular mechanisms of NSC-743380-mediated anti-leukemia activity in AML cell lines and antileukemia activity of NSC-743380 in patient-derived primary leukemia cells from AML patients. Our results showed that treatment with NSC-743380 triggered robust apoptosis in SULT1A1-positive AML cells. Treatment with NSC-743380 did not increase intracellular reactive oxygen species or change of STAT3 activity in AML cells, but did dramatically and rapidly decrease cFLIP expression. Proteomic analysis with reverse phase protein microarray revealed that treatment of U937 and THP-1 AML cells with NSC-743380 led to drastic and time-dependent suppression of phosphorylation of several key nodes in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, including AKT and mTOR. Moreover, primary AML cells expressed SULT1A1 were highly sensitive to treatment with NSC-743380, which was not affected by co-culture with bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells. Thus, our results provide proof-of-concept evidence that AML cells expressing SULT1A1 can be targeted by small molecules that induce apoptosis through inhibiting the expression or activities of multiple targets.","['Huang, Xiao', 'Cao, Mengru', 'Wu, Shuhong', 'Wang, Li', 'Hu, Jing', 'Mehran, Reza J', 'Roth, Jack A', 'Swisher, Stephen G', 'Wang, Rui-Yu', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M', 'Andreeff, Michael', 'Sun, Xiaoping', 'Fang, Bingliang']","['Huang X', 'Cao M', 'Wu S', 'Wang L', 'Hu J', 'Mehran RJ', 'Roth JA', 'Swisher SG', 'Wang RY', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Andreeff M', 'Sun X', 'Fang B']","['Department of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.', 'Department of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Beijing Friendship Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing 100050, China.', 'Department of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.', 'Department of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.', 'Department of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.', 'Department of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.', 'Department of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.', 'Department of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.', 'Department of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.', 'Department of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA190628/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['Journal Article'],20171101,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,PMC5731942,['NOTNLM'],"['SULT1A1', 'biomarker', 'cancer', 'drug development', 'sulfotransferase']",2017/12/20 06:00,2017/12/20 06:01,['2017/12/20 06:00'],"['2017/07/03 00:00 [received]', '2017/09/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/12/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/12/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/20 06:01 [medline]']","['10.18632/oncotarget.22235 [doi]', '22235 [pii]']",epublish,Oncotarget. 2017 Nov 1;8(60):102150-102160. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.22235. eCollection 2017 Nov 24.,,60,,,,,,"['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST The authors declare that they have no conflicts of', 'interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Higher levels of these proteasomes are associated with higher cancer burden and stage. The etiology and functions of these proteasomes, referred to as circulating, plasmatic, or extracellular proteasomes (ex-PSs), are unclear. Here we show that human cancer cell lines, as well as human endometrium-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hMESCs), release proteasome complexes into culture medium (CM). To define ex-PS composition, we have affinity purified them from CM conditioned by human leukemia cell line K562. Using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FT-ICR) mass spectrometry (MS), we have identified core 20S proteasome subunits and a set of 15 proteasome-interacting proteins (PIPs), all previously described as exosome cargo proteins.

Tim-3 has also been identified in various solid tumors. However, the role of Tim-3 expression on blast cells in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is not well understood. In this study, we aimed to explore the role of Tim-3 in patients with de novo AML, and the correlation between Tim-3 and clinicopathological prognosis. The study cohort consisted of 76 patients with de novo non-M3 AML. These patients' bone marrow samples were collected and then bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMCs) were isolated for flow cytometry to detect Tim-3 expression on blasts. According to FAB type, 76 diagnosed AML patients included in this study were: M0 (n=2), M1 (n=16), M2 (n=20), M4 (n=20), M5 (n=16), and M6 (n=2). A positive expression (>20%) of Tim-3 was found in 87% (66/76) of patients with AML. The average percentage of Tim-3(+) blasts in these AML patients was 58.26 +/- 29.23%. Moreover, the frequency of Tim-3 high expression was higher in M4 patients than that in other AML patients according to FAB type (P=0.004). Tim-3 high expression was also closely associated with inv(16) (P=0.01) and C/EBPA mutation (P=0.03). The mutations of the following six genes, i.e., FLT3-ITD, NPM1, C-KIT, IDH1/IDH2, DNMT3A, were independent of the Tim-3 expression. Additionally, it is more likely to find higher levels of Tim-3 in the low-risk group than in the intermediate- and high-risk groups (P=0.02). The expression of Tim-3 was positively correlated with CD13 (r=0.36, P=0.001), CD34 (r=0.41, P=0.000), and CD7 (r=0.27, P=0.02) in AML patients. AML patients with high Tim-3 expression achieved significantly high complete remission (CR) rate (P=0.01), while their Tim-3 expression significantly decreased after CR (P=0.01). Blockade of Tim-3 expression on AML blasts significantly reduced the Idarubicin (IDA)-mediated suppression of cell growth and reduction of cell apoptosis in vitro. Collectively, our study suggests that high Tim-3 expression on AML blasts could enhances chemotherapy sensitivity.","['Xu, Liangjing', 'Xu, Jinge', 'Ma, Shoubao', 'Li, Xiaoli', 'Zhu, Mingqing', 'Chen,

We have successfully cloned a gene related to AML termed FAMLF from a FAB-M2 patient's sample of a second largest AML pedigree. Then we revealed at least three splice variants, named as FAMLF-1, FAMLF-2 and FAMLF-3, and found miR181a1/b1 in the second intron of FAMLF gene family. Higher expression of FAMLF-1 was related to a higher complete remission (CR) rate, but shorter relapse free survival (RFS) in AML. We further found that the FAMLF-1 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) haplotype and its expression were positively correlated to clinical parameters of acute myeloid leukemia partially differentiated (FAB-M2) patients, but not FAB non-M2 patients or Acute Monocytic Leukemia (FAB-M5) patients. GTAGG SNP haplotype of FAMLF gene might increase FAB-M2 susceptibility in Han population and act as a useful candidate biomarker for FAB-M2 screening. We also demonstrated that FAMLF-1 gene silencing in FAB-M2 cells could lead to proliferation inhibition, cell cycle G0/G1 phase arrest, and differentiation promotion independent of its intronic miR-181a1, which might be related to Akt/c-Myc pathway.

By simulating hyperglycemia with high glucose we may increase the effectiveness of inhibition of lactate and proton export on the dysregulation of cell pH homeostasis causing cell death or disruption of growth in cancer cells. MCT1 and MCT4 expression was determined in MCF7 and K562 cell lines using RT-PCR. Cell viability, growth, intracellular pH and cell cycle analysis was measured in the cell lines grown in 5mM and 25mM glucose containing media in the presence and absence of the MCT1 inhibitor AR-C155858 (1muM) and the NHE1 inhibitor cariporide (10muM). The MCT1 inhibitor, AR-C155858 had minimal effect on the viability, growth and intracellular pH of MCT4 expressing MCF7 cells. AR-C155858 had no effect on the viability of the MCT1 expressing K562 cells, but decreased intracellular pH and cell proliferation, by a glucose-dependent mechanism. Inhibition of NHE1 on its own had a no effect on cell growth, but together with AR-C155858 showed an additive effect on inhibition of cell growth. In cancer cells that only express MCT1, increased glucose concentrations in the presence of an MCT1 inhibitor decreased intracellular pH and reduced cell growth by G1 phase cell-cycle arrest. Thus we propose a transient hyperglycemic-clamp in combination with proton export inhibitors be evaluated as an adjunct to cancer treatment in clinical studies.","['Pivovarova, Aleksandra I', 'MacGregor, Gordon G']","['Pivovarova AI', 'MacGregor GG']","['Alabama College of Osteopathic Medicine, 445 Health Sciences Blvd, Dothan, AL 36303, United States.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, University of Alabama in Huntsville, 301 Sparkman Dr, Huntsville, AL 35899, United States.

We identified previously unreported mutations involving epigenetic regulators such as KDM5C, SRIT6, CHD4, and PRPF6 in pediatric AML patients. Despite low prevalence in general pediatric AML, mutations involving epigenetic regulators including splicing factors, were collectively enriched as a group in primary chemo-resistance AML patients. In addition, clonal evolution analysis of secondary chemo-resistance AML patients reveals dominant clone at diagnosis could survive several course of intensified chemotherapy. And gain of new mutations in genes such as MVP, TCF3, SS18, and BCL10, may contribute to chemo-resistance at relapse.

However, 40% of samples derived from patients with better outcomes fail to engraft in immunodeficient mouse recipients when conventional protocols are followed. At diagnosis, the engraftment of intermediate-risk group samples cannot be anticipated. In this study, we decided to further explore the reasons for xenograft success and failure. No differences in extracellular phenotype, apoptosis, or cell cycle profile could distinguish samples that engraft (engrafter [E]) from samples that do not engraft (nonengrafter [NE]) in NSG mice. In addition, ex vivo long-term culture assay revealed, after 5 weeks, a lower content of leukemic-LTC-initiating cells in the NE samples associated with a lower expansion rate capacity. One-week co-cultures with mesenchymal or osteoblastic or endothelial cells did not influence the proliferation rate, suggesting that E and NE samples are genuinely rapidly or slowly expanding independent of external cue. Engraftment success for some NE samples was consistently observed in recipient mice analyzed 6 months later than the conventional 3-month period. Eventually we implemented a flow cytometry-based assay, which allowed us to predict, in 1 week, the fast or delayed engraftment potential of a noncharacterized acute myeloid leukemia sample. This approach will be especially useful in selecting intermediate-risk-group patient samples and restricting the experimental duration to a 3-month period and, eventually, in reducing the number of animals and the cost and effort of unnecessary xenograft failures.","['Griessinger, Emmanuel', 'Vargaftig, Jacques', 'Horswell, Stuart', 'Taussig, David C', 'Gribben, John', 'Bonnet, Dominique']","['Griessinger E', 'Vargaftig J', 'Horswell S', 'Taussig DC', 'Gribben J', 'Bonnet D']","['INSERM U1065, C3M, Team 4 Inflammation, Cancer, Cancer Stem Cells, Nice, France; Haematopoietic Stem Cell Laboratory, The Francis Crick Institute, London, United Kingdom.

Methods Patients with WDTC were identified from SEER registries. Competing risk regression analysis was performed to calculate the risks of SHMs that occurred after WDTC treatment and outcomes after SHM development were assessed. Results Of 148,215 patients with WDTC, 53% received surgery alone and 47% received RAI. In total, 783 patients developed an SHM after a median interval of 6.5 years (interquartile range, 3.3 to 11.2 years) from WDTC diagnosis. In multivariable analysis, compared with those undergoing thyroidectomy alone, RAI treatment was associated with an increased early risk of developing acute myeloid leukemia (AML; hazard ratio, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.13 to 2.82; P = .01) and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML; hazard ratio, 3.44; 95% CI, 1.87 to 6.36; P < .001). This increased risk of AML and CML after RAI treatment was seen even in low-risk and intermediate-risk WDTC tumors. Occurrence of AML but not CML in patients with WDTC was associated with shorter median overall survival compared with matched controls (8.0 years v 31.0 years; P = .001). In addition, AML developing after RAI trended toward inferior survival compared with matched controls with de novo AML (median overall survival, 1.2 years v 2.9 years; P = .06). Conclusion Patients with WDTC treated with RAI had an increased early risk of developing AML and CML but no other hematologic malignancies. AML that arises after RAI treatment has a poor prognosis. RAI use in patients with WDTC should be limited to patients with high-risk disease features, and patients with WDTC treated with adjuvant RAI should be monitored for myeloid malignancies as part of cancer surveillance.","['Molenaar, Remco J', 'Sidana, Surbhi', 'Radivoyevitch, Tomas', 'Advani, Anjali S', 'Gerds, Aaron T', 'Carraway, Hetty E', 'Angelini, Dana', 'Kalaycio, Matt', 'Nazha, Aziz', 'Adelstein, David J', 'Nasr, Christian', 'Maciejewski, Jaroslaw P', 'Majhail, Navneet S', 'Sekeres, Mikkael A', 'Mukherjee, Sudipto']","['Molenaar RJ', 'Sidana S', 'Radivoyevitch T', 'Advani AS', 'Gerds AT', 'Carraway HE', 'Angelini D', 'Kalaycio M', 'Nazha A', 'Adelstein DJ', 'Nasr C', 'Maciejewski JP', 'Majhail NS', 'Sekeres MA', 'Mukherjee S']","['Remco J.

Failure of this transition leads to pulmonary hypertension (PH), a major cause of newborn mortality associated with preterm birth, infection, hypoxia, and malformations including congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH). While individual vasoconstrictor and dilator genes have been identified, the coordination of their expression is not well understood. Here, we found that lung mesenchyme-specific deletion of CDH-implicated genes encoding pre-B cell leukemia transcription factors (Pbx) led to lethal PH in mice shortly after birth. Loss of Pbx genes resulted in the misexpression of both vasoconstrictors and vasodilators in multiple pathways that converge to increase phosphorylation of myosin in vascular smooth muscle (VSM) cells, causing persistent constriction. While targeting endothelin and angiotensin, which are upstream regulators that promote VSM contraction, was not effective, treatment with the Rho-kinase inhibitor Y-27632 reduced vessel constriction and PH in Pbx-mutant mice. These results demonstrate a lung-intrinsic, herniation-independent cause of PH in CDH. More broadly, our findings indicate that neonatal PH can result from perturbation of multiple pathways and suggest that targeting the downstream common effectors may be a more effective treatment for neonatal PH.","['McCulley, David J', 'Wienhold, Mark D', 'Hines, Elizabeth A', 'Hacker, Timothy A', 'Rogers, Allison', 'Pewowaruk, Ryan J', 'Zewdu, Rediet', 'Chesler, Naomi C', 'Selleri, Licia', 'Sun, Xin']","['McCulley DJ', 'Wienhold MD', 'Hines EA', 'Hacker TA', 'Rogers A', 'Pewowaruk RJ', 'Zewdu R', 'Chesler NC', 'Selleri L', 'Sun X']","['Department of Pediatrics.', 'Department of Pediatrics.', 'Laboratory of Genetics.', 'Department of Medicine, and.', 'Department of Medicine, and.', 'Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Wisconsin - Madison, Madison, Wisconsin, USA.', 'Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, Weill Medical College of Cornell University, New York, New York, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics.', 'Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Wisconsin - Madison, Madison, Wisconsin, USA.', 'Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, Weill Medical College of Cornell University, New York, New York, USA.', 'Program in Craniofacial Biology, Institute of Human Genetics, Departments of Orofacial Sciences and Anatomy, UCSF, San Francisco, California, USA.', 'Laboratory of Genetics.', 'Department of Pediatrics, UCSD, San Diego, California, USA.']",['eng'],"['KL2 TR000428/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'OT2 OD023857/OD/NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL113870/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 TR002373/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'KL2 TR002374/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 TR000427/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20171218,United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,PMC5785269,['NOTNLM'],"['*Cardiovascular disease', '*Development', '*Genetics', '*Mouse models', '*Respiration']",2017/12/19 06:00,2019/07/16 06:00,['2017/12/19 06:00'],"['2017/02/14 00:00 [received]', '2017/11/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/12/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/16 06:00 [medline]', '2017/12/19 06:00 [entrez]']","['93395 [pii]', '10.1172/JCI93395 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 2018 Feb 1;128(2):655-667. doi: 10.1172/JCI93395.

The RBC antigen typing, identification of ABO blood type and quantitative analysis of InDel-, STR-, Y-polymorphisms were carried out for detection of DC. In addition, the expression of well-known oncogenes and CD-markers for monitoring MRD was evaluated to predict relapse and clinical outcome. According to our research, the analysis of InDel polymorphism using AlleleSEQR-PCR is more sensitive test for estimation of DC as compared with other assays. Moreover, the sensitivity of AlleleSEQR-PCR may be increased after isolation of the CD34 cell population in bone marrow. Nevertheless, observation of high levels in DC ((3)95%) in some leukemia patients (ALL, Ph+, bcr-abl/p190+) during first 6 months after HSCT cannot exclude the possibility of relapse. Thus, the combined monitoring of both DC (InDel) and MRD (oncogenes, WT1 and CD-markers) is a more advisable and useful test in managing hematologic malignancies and predicting relapse risk after allo-HSCT.","['Bogdanov, K V', 'Motorin, D V', 'Nikulina, T S', 'Pisotskaya, O S', 'Babenetskaya, D V', 'Mirolyubova, Y V', 'Volkova, O Y', 'Zaritskiy, A Y']","['Bogdanov KV', 'Motorin DV', 'Nikulina TS', 'Pisotskaya OS', 'Babenetskaya DV', 'Mirolyubova YV', 'Volkova OY', 'Zaritskiy AY']","['Institute of Hematology, Federal V.A.

Its efficacy depends on induction of graft versus leukemia by donor lymphocytes. Both graft versus leukemia and graft versus host disease are induced by T cells reactive against polymorphic peptides, called minor histocompatibility antigens (MiHA), which differ between patient and donor and are presented in the context of self-HLA (where HLA is human leukocyte antigen). The allelic counterpart (AC) of the MiHA is generally considered to be absent at the cell surface, based on the absence of immune responses directed against the AC. To study this in detail, we evaluate the recognition, HLA-binding affinity, and cell surface expression of three selected MiHA. By quantitative MS, we demonstrate the similarly abundant expression of both MiHA and AC at the cell surface. We conclude that the absent recognition of the AC cannot generally be explained by insufficient processing and presentation at the cell surface of the AC.","['Bijen, Helena M', 'Hassan, Chopie', 'Kester, Michel G D', 'Janssen, George M C', 'Hombrink, Pleun', 'de Ru, Arnoud H', 'Drijfhout, Jan Wouter', 'Meiring, Hugo D', 'de Jong, Ad P', 'Falkenburg, J H Frederik', 'Jimenez, Connie R', 'Heemskerk, Mirjam H M', 'van Veelen, Peter A']","['Bijen HM', 'Hassan C', 'Kester MGD', 'Janssen GMC', 'Hombrink P', 'de Ru AH', 'Drijfhout JW', 'Meiring HD', 'de Jong AP', 'Falkenburg JHF', 'Jimenez CR', 'Heemskerk MHM', 'van Veelen PA']","['Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Center for Proteomics and Metabolomics, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Center for Proteomics and Metabolomics, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Center for Proteomics and Metabolomics, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Center for Proteomics and Metabolomics, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Laboratory for Vaccine Research, Unit Research and Development, Netherlands Vaccine Institute, National Institute for Public Health and the Environment, Bilthoven, The Netherlands.', 'Laboratory for Vaccine Research, Unit Research and Development, Netherlands Vaccine Institute, National Institute for Public Health and the Environment, Bilthoven, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'OncoProteomics Laboratory, Medical Oncology, VU Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Center for Proteomics and Metabolomics, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180223,Germany,Proteomics,Proteomics,101092707,,['NOTNLM'],"['*MRM/SRM', '*MS-LC-MS/MS', '*T cell immunology', '*immunoproteomics', '*leukaemia/lymphoma', '*peptidomics', '*stable isotope labeling']",2017/12/19 06:00,2019/08/17 06:00,['2017/12/19 06:00'],"['2017/09/19 00:00 [received]', '2017/11/22 00:00 [revised]', '2017/12/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/17 06:00 [medline]', '2017/12/19 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pmic.201700250 [doi]'],ppublish,Proteomics. 2018 Jun;18(12):e1700250. doi: 10.1002/pmic.201700250.

Herein, the synthesis of a polymer with trehalose side chains and hydrolytically degradable backbone esters and its evaluation for protein stabilization and cytotoxicity are described. Specifically, an alkene-containing parent polymer is synthesized by reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer polymerization, and thiolated trehalose is installed using a radical-initiated thiol-ene reaction. The stabilizing properties of the polymer are investigated by thermally stressing granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), which is expressed and purified using a custom-designed G-CSF fusion protein with a polyhistidine-tagged maltose binding protein. The degradable polymer is shown to stabilize G-CSF to 66% after heating at 40 degrees C.

With limited drug options and the severe side effects associated with the current chemotherapy, there is pressing need to look for new and novel anticancer agents. Against this backdrop, in the present study we evaluated the anticancer activity of a natural coumarin, marmesin against human leukemia cell line U937 and normal human monocytes It was observed that marmesin exhibited an IC50 value of 40 microM and exerted its cytotoxic effects in a dose-dependent manner. However, the cytotoxic effects of marmesin were comparatively lower for the normal human monocytes as evident from the IC50 of 125 microM. Our results indicated that marmesin inhibits colony formation and induces apoptosis dose-dependently. We also investigated the effect of marmesin on the expression of Bax and Bcl-2 proteins. It was observed that marmesin treatment triggered upregulation of Bax and downregulation of Bcl-2 causing significant increase in the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, marmesin could also induce ROS mediated alterations in mitochondrial membrane potential. Additionally, marmesin induced G2/M cell cycle arrest and significantly inhibited cell migration potential of leukemia cells at the IC50. Remarkably, marmesin prevent tumor growth significantly in vivo at the dosage of 30 mg/kg in vivo. These results strongly indicate that marmesin may prove to be a novel anticancer lead for the management of leukemia.","['Dong, Lin', 'Xu, Wen-Wei', 'Li, Hong', 'Bi, Ke-Hong']","['Dong L', 'Xu WW', 'Li H', 'Bi KH']","['Department of Hematology, Qianfoshan Hospital Affiliated to Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong 250014, P.R.

The PubMed database, the Cochrane Library, conference proceedings, the EMBASE databases, and references of published trials and review articles were searched. Two reviewers independently assessed the quality of the trials and extracted the data. Odd ratios (ORs) for complete remission (CR) rate after induction therapy, 5-year overall survival (OS), and 5-year disease free survival (DFS) were pooled using the STATA package. MAIN RESULTS: Seventeen trials involving 2252 patients were ultimately analyzed. The pooled OR showed that the FLT3 ITD mutation group had a poor prognosis in terms of CR rate (OR = 0.53, 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.30-0.95, P = 0.03), 5-year OS (OR = 0.47, 95% CI, 0.29-0.75, P = 0.002), and as 5-year DFS (OR = 0.48, 95% CI, 0.29-0.78; p = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: The results suggested that FLT3 ITD mutations could become an indicator of poor prognosis of APL, and these patients should receive more intensive therapy according to current guidelines.","['Fan, Yingchao', 'Cao, Yanan', 'Bai, Xiaosong', 'Zhuang, Wenfang']","['Fan Y', 'Cao Y', 'Bai X', 'Zhuang W']","[""a Department of Laboratory Diagnosis , Shidong Hospital of Yangpu Distric , Shanghai , People's Republic of China."", ""a Department of Laboratory Diagnosis , Shidong Hospital of Yangpu Distric , Shanghai , People's Republic of China."", ""a Department of Laboratory Diagnosis , Shidong Hospital of Yangpu Distric , Shanghai , People's Republic of China."", ""a Department of Laboratory Diagnosis , Shidong Hospital of Yangpu Distric , Shanghai , People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis']",20171218,England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,,['NOTNLM'],"['5-year DFS', '5-year OS', 'CR rate', 'FLT3', 'acute promyelocytic leukemia', 'meta-analysis', 'odds ratio', 'survival']",2017/12/19 06:00,2018/10/20 06:00,['2017/12/19 06:00'],"['2017/12/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/20 06:00 [medline]', '2017/12/19 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10245332.2017.1415717 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematology. 2018 Aug;23(7):379-384. doi: 10.1080/10245332.2017.1415717.

At the same time, there exist thousands of various cell lines that were treated with hundreds of anti-cancer drugs in order to check the ability of these drugs to stop the cell proliferation, and all these cell line cultures were profiled in terms of their gene expression. Here we present a new approach in machine learning, which can predict clinical efficiency of anti-cancer drugs for individual patients by transferring features obtained from the expression-based data from cell lines.

We retrospectively analyzed 80 adult patients with de novo AML who received intensive chemotherapy. Multiple LSC marker expression was significantly associated with shorter three-year overall survival (OS), compared with single or no LSC marker expression (18.2 vs. 65.0%, p < .001). Multivariate analysis showed that the expression of multiple LSC markers remained significant in terms of three-year OS (hazard ratio: 3.80, p = .001).

AIMS: To review the current treatment paradigm of patients with high-risk disease, in particular those with del(17p) and TP53 variants. RESULTS: A 'watch and wait' approach is recommended for all patients who are asymptomatic. When symptomatic, fluorescence in situ hybridisation testing should be performed and gene sequencing considered subsequently to identify del(17p) and TP53 variants respectively. In the front-line setting, treatment within a clinical trial is the preferred option. In the relapsed or refractory setting, patients with del(17p) or TP53 aberrations should be offered treatment with a novel agent, such as ibrutinib, idelalisib-rituximab or venetoclax. However, of note, at the date of this publication venetoclax is not PBS reimbursed, and ibrutinib will not be reimbursed until 1 December 2017. CONCLUSION: Testing for del(17p) and TP53 variants identifies high-risk CLL that requires specialist management.","['Kuss, Bryone J', 'Tam, Constantine S']","['Kuss BJ', 'Tam CS']","['Department of Haematology, Flinders Medical Centre, SA Pathology, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia.', 'Molecular Medicine and Pathology, College of Medicine and Public Health, Flinders University, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia.', 'Department of Haematology, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', ""Department of Haematology, St. Vincent's Hospital, Fitzroy, Melbourne, Australia.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Australia,Intern Med J,Internal medicine journal,101092952,,['NOTNLM'],"['Australia', 'chronic lymphocytic', 'leukaemia', 'therapeutics']",2017/12/19 06:00,2018/08/08 06:00,['2017/12/19 06:00'],"['2017/12/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/12/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/08/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/imj.13680 [doi]'],ppublish,Intern Med J. 2017 Dec;47 Suppl 6:5-10. doi: 10.1111/imj.13680.,20180807,,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Purines)', '0 (Quinazolinones)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', 'YG57I8T5M0 (idelalisib)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols', 'Australia', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17/genetics', 'Guidelines as Topic', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/*genetics/immunology', '*Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Purines/*therapeutic use', 'Quinazolinones/*therapeutic use', 'Rituximab/*therapeutic use', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics', 'Watchful Waiting']",,['(c) 2017 Royal Australasian College of Physicians.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, no studies so far have presented current transfusion statistics on a population level for this patient group. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A retrospective descriptive study was conducted that was based on the Scandinavian Donations and Transfusions Database (SCANDAT2), which includes data on all blood donations and transfusions in Sweden and Denmark since the 1960s. Incident cases of hematologic malignancies were identified in the Swedish Cancer Register between 2000 and 2010. Cases were divided into nine patient groups based on diagnosis. RESULTS: A total of 28,693 patients were included in the cohort. Overall, the transfusion pattern varied depending on diagnosis and age. Patients with aggressive and acute diagnoses generally received more transfusions with immediate decline in transfusion incidence after diagnosis, whereas chronic diagnoses generally maintained more stable, but lower, transfusion incidence. In general, patients with leukemia received more transfusions than patients with lymphoma, and patients with acute leukemia as well as patients that had undergone allogeneic stem cell transplantations received the most transfusions. Within 2 years after diagnosis, patients with acute myeloid leukemia diagnosed at ages 0 to 65 years received on average between 30 to 40 red blood cell transfusions and platelet transfusions, respectively, corresponding to direct material costs close to 200,000 SEK (23,809 USD). CONCLUSION: Results from this population-based overview of blood use in hematologic malignancies showed high variability depending on diagnosis and age.","['Zhao, Jingcheng', 'Ryden, Jenny', 'Wikman, Agneta', 'Norda, Rut', 'Stanworth, Simon J', 'Hjalgrim, Henrik', 'Edgren, Gustaf']","['Zhao J', 'Ryden J', 'Wikman A', 'Norda R', 'Stanworth SJ', 'Hjalgrim H', 'Edgren G']","['Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Hematology, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical Immunology and Transfusion Medicine, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Immunology, Genetics and Pathology, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Transfusion Medicine, NHS Blood and Transplant, and the Department of Hematology, Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Radcliffe Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, and Oxford BRC Hematology Theme, Oxford, UK.', 'Department of Epidemiology Research, Statens Serum Institut.', 'Department of Hematology, Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Hematology, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20171217,United States,Transfusion,Transfusion,0417360,,,,2017/12/19 06:00,2018/09/05 06:00,['2017/12/19 06:00'],"['2017/05/24 00:00 [received]', '2017/09/26 00:00 [revised]', '2017/10/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/12/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/09/05 06:00 [medline]', '2017/12/19 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/trf.14440 [doi]'],ppublish,Transfusion. 2018 Feb;58(2):390-401. doi: 10.1111/trf.14440.

In order to reduce the relapse risk and improve the survival, the strategy of early tapering of immunosuppressive agents was prospectively evaluated. Thirty-one patients with advanced AML received early tapering of immunosuppressive drugs, while 32 patients with AML in complete remission (CR) were given the routine tapering of immunosuppressive agents after HLA-matched donor transplantation. All advanced AML patients achieved CR after allo-HSCT. At 24 months after transplantation, relapse incidences were 22% in advanced group and 16% in CR group (P = 0.553); disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were 57.7 and 57.8% in advanced group, while in CR group were 66.6% (P = 0.388) and 66.2% (P = 0.423); immunosuppressive agent-free DFS (IDFS) were similar between two groups (P = 0.407). Acute graft-versus-host disease (aGvHD) incidences were similar between two groups (P = 0.311). Chronic GvHD (cGvHD) incidence was much higher in advanced group than in CR group (70.4 vs 38.7%, P = 0.02), but severe cGvHD had no difference. In multivariate analysis, cGvHD was an independent prognostic factor for lower risk of relapse and better DFS and OS; early tapering of immunosuppressive agents was an independent prognostic factor for cGvHD. The study suggested that advanced AML patients could be directly treated with allo-HSCT and its survival could be improved through the strategy of early tapering of immunosuppressive agents without significant adverse effects ( Clinicaltrials.org NCT03150134).","['Yang, Jun', 'Cai, Yu', 'Jiang, JieLing', 'Wan, LiPing', 'Bai, HaiTao', 'Zhu, Jun', 'Li, Su', 'Wang, Chun', 'Song, Xianmin']","['Yang J', 'Cai Y', 'Jiang J', 'Wan L', 'Bai H', 'Zhu J', 'Li S', 'Wang C', 'Song X']","['Department of Hematology, Shanghai General Hospital affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Haining road 100, Shanghai, 200080, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Shanghai General Hospital affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Haining road 100, Shanghai, 200080, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Shanghai General Hospital affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Haining road 100, Shanghai, 200080, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Shanghai General Hospital affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Haining road 100, Shanghai, 200080, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Shanghai General Hospital affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Haining road 100, Shanghai, 200080, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Shanghai General Hospital affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Haining road 100, Shanghai, 200080, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Shanghai General Hospital affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Haining road 100, Shanghai, 200080, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Shanghai General Hospital affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Haining road 100, Shanghai, 200080, China. wangchun2@medmail.com.cn.', 'Department of Hematology, Shanghai General Hospital affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Haining road 100, Shanghai, 200080, China. shongxm@sjtu.edu.cn.']",['eng'],['91370601/National Natural Science Foundation of China'],['Journal Article'],20171218,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,PMC5797220,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia (AML)', 'Allogeneic', 'Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT)', 'Immunosuppressive agents']",2017/12/19 06:00,2018/02/16 06:00,['2017/12/19 06:00'],"['2017/08/13 00:00 [received]', '2017/12/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/12/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/16 06:00 [medline]', '2017/12/19 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00277-017-3204-6 [doi]', '10.1007/s00277-017-3204-6 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2018 Mar;97(3):497-507. doi: 10.1007/s00277-017-3204-6.

In the absence of diagnostic criteria or biomarkers, CNO/CRMO remains a diagnosis of exclusion. The aim of this study was to identify biomarkers for diagnosing multifocal disease (CRMO). Study design: Sera from 71 pediatric CRMO patients, 11 patients with osteoarticular infections, 62 patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), 7 patients with para-infectious or reactive arthritis, and 43 patients with acute leukemia or lymphoma, as well as 59 healthy individuals were collected. Multiplex analysis of 18 inflammation- and/or bone remodeling-associated serum proteins was performed. Statistical analysis included univariate ANOVA, discriminant analysis, univariate receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, and logistic regression analyses. Results: For 14 of 18 blood serum proteins, significant differences were determined between CRMO patients, at least one alternative diagnosis, or healthy controls. Multi-component discriminant analysis delivered five biomarkers (IL-6, CCL11/eotaxin, CCL5/RANTES, collagen Ialpha, sIL-2R) for the diagnosis of CRMO. ROC analysis allowed further reduction to a core set of 2 biomarkers (CCL11/eotaxin, IL-6) that are sufficient to discern between CRMO, healthy controls, and alternative diagnoses. Conclusion: Serum biomarkers CCL11/eotaxin and IL-6 differentiate between patients with CRMO, healthy controls, and alternative diagnoses (leukemia and lymphoma, osteoarticular infections, para-infectious arthritis, and JIA). Easily accessible biomarkers may aid in diagnosing CRMO. Further studies testing biomarkers in larger unrelated cohorts are warranted.","['Hofmann, Sigrun Ruth', 'Bottger, Fanny', 'Range, Ursula', 'Luck, Christian', 'Morbach, Henner', 'Girschick, Hermann Joseph', 'Suttorp, Meinolf', 'Hedrich, Christian Michael']","['Hofmann SR', 'Bottger F', 'Range U', 'Luck C', 'Morbach H', 'Girschick HJ', 'Suttorp M', 'Hedrich CM']","['Department of Pediatrics, Medizinische Fakultat Carl Gustav Carus, Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Medizinische Fakultat Carl Gustav Carus, Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Institute for Medical Informatics and Biometry, Medizinische Fakultat Carl Gustav Carus, Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Institute for Medical Microbiology, Medizinische Fakultat Carl Gustav Carus, Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', ""University Children's Hospital Wurzburg, University of Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany."", ""Children's Hospital, Vivantes Klinikum im Friedrichshain, Berlin, Germany."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Medizinische Fakultat Carl Gustav Carus, Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Medizinische Fakultat Carl Gustav Carus, Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', ""Department of Women's and Children's Health, Institute of Translational Medicine, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, United Kingdom."", ""Department of Paediatric Rheumatology, Alder Hey Children's NHS Foundation Trust Hospital, Liverpool, United Kingdom.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20171201,Switzerland,Front Pediatr,Frontiers in pediatrics,101615492,PMC5716982,['NOTNLM'],"['autoinflammation', 'biomarker', 'chronic nonbacterial osteomyelitis', 'chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis', 'diagnosis', 'inflammation']",2017/12/19 06:00,2017/12/19 06:01,['2017/12/19 06:00'],"['2017/10/17 00:00 [received]', '2017/11/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/12/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/12/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/19 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fped.2017.00256 [doi]'],epublish,Front Pediatr. 2017 Dec 1;5:256. doi: 10.3389/fped.2017.00256. eCollection 2017.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present study aimed to identify reliable candidate biomarkers to improve the early detection of liver cirrhosis. An integrated analysis of expression profiles of microRNAs (miRNAs/miRs) and mRNAs in liver cirrhosis tissues from the GEO database was performed. Next, the regulatory targets of the differentially expressed miRNAs in liver cirrhosis tissues were predicted. In addition, a regulatory network of miRNA-target genes was constructed. A total of 4 eligible mRNA expression profiling studies and 2 miRNA expression profiling studies met the inclusion criteria, and were thus included. A total of 48 differentially expressed miRNAs and 1,773 differentially expressed genes were identified in liver cirrhosis tissues compared with normal tissues. There were 240 miRNA-target pairs whose expression was negatively correlated. In the miRNA-target regulatory network, overexpression of miR-21 and miR-199a-3p was suggested to be closely associated with the progression of liver cirrhosis. In addition, functional enrichment analysis of the target genes indicated that cell cycle was the most significantly enriched pathway, and the dysregulation of leukemia inhibitory factor, cancerous inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2A and retinoblastoma-associated protein 1 clearly suggested their importance in the development of liver cirrhosis. We hypothesized that miR-21 and miR-199a-3p may be promising non-invasive diagnostic biomarkers for the early diagnosis of liver cirrhosis. The miRNA-target regulatory network may provide additional insight into the current data regarding the role of miRNAs in liver cirrhosis.","['Du, Hongbo', 'Yu, Hao', 'Yang, Yuying', 'Song, Yuanyuan', 'Wang, Fei', 'Li, Shangheng', 'Jiang, Yuyong']","['Du H', 'Yu H', 'Yang Y', 'Song Y', 'Wang F', 'Li S', 'Jiang Y']","['Department of Gastroenterology, Dongzhimen Hospital, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing 100007, P.R.

SYK inhibition has shown promising results in the treatment of arthritis and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). However, in other context, it has been shown that SYK overexpression in epithelial cancer cells induced senescence in p53-dependent mechanism, which underscored its antineoplastic activity in vitro. Here, we show that SYK was induced in response of DNA damage in parallel with p53 levels. In addition, using chemical inhibitors of SYK reduced p53 levels in HCT116 and HT1080 cell lines, which underlines the role of SYK inhibition on p53 activity. Furthermore, SYK inhibition modulated the cell growth, which resulted in a decreasing in cell death. Interestingly, SYK expression showed a positive prognosis in patients with solid tumors in correlations with their survival rates, as expected negative correlation was seen between SYK expression and survival rate of patients with CLL. In conclusion, these findings demonstrate that SYK inhibition modulates p53 expression and activity in HCT116 and HT1080 cells. Reconsidering using of SYK inhibitors in clinical setting in the future should be evaluated carefully in accordance with these findings to prevent the formation of secondary malignancies.","['Althubiti, Mohammad']",['Althubiti M'],"['Biochemistry Department, Faculty of Medicine, Umm Al-Qura University, Makkah, Saudi Arabia.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20170920,United States,J Cell Death,Journal of cell death,101534028,PMC5726622,['NOTNLM'],"['HCT116', 'HT1080', 'SYK', 'apoptosis', 'p53']",2017/12/19 06:00,2017/12/19 06:01,['2017/12/19 06:00'],"['2017/07/07 00:00 [received]', '2017/08/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/12/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/12/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/19 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1177/1179066017731564 [doi]', '10.1177_1179066017731564 [pii]']",epublish,J Cell Death. 2017 Sep 20;10:1179066017731564. doi: 10.1177/1179066017731564. eCollection 2017.,,,,,,,,"['Declaration of Conflicting Interests:The author(s) declared no potential', 'conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or', 'publication of this article.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To better understand the intracellular dynamics of AZA upon therapy and decipher the molecular basis for AZA resistance, we have developed a novel, multiparameter, quantitative mass spectrometry method (AZA-MS). Using AZA-MS, we have accurately quantified the abundance of the ribonucleoside (5-AZA-cR) and deoxyribonucleoside (5-AZA-CdR) forms of AZA in RNA, DNA and the cytoplasm within the same sample using nanogram quantities of input material. We report that although AZA induces DNA demethylation in a dose-dependent manner, it has no corresponding effect on RNA methylation. By applying AZA-MS to primary bone marrow samples from patients undergoing AZA therapy, we have identified that responders accumulate more 5-AZA-CdR in their DNA compared with nonresponders. AZA resistance was not a result of impaired AZA metabolism or intracellular accumulation. Furthermore, AZA-MS has helped to uncover different modes of AZA resistance. Whereas some nonresponders fail to incorporate sufficient 5-AZA-CdR into DNA, others incorporate 5-AZA-CdR and effect DNA demethylation like AZA responders, but show no clinical benefit.","['Unnikrishnan, A', 'Vo, A N Q', 'Pickford, R', 'Raftery, M J', 'Nunez, A C', 'Verma, A', 'Hesson, L B', 'Pimanda, J E']","['Unnikrishnan A', 'Vo ANQ', 'Pickford R', 'Raftery MJ', 'Nunez AC', 'Verma A', 'Hesson LB', 'Pimanda JE']","['Adult Cancer Program, Lowy Cancer Research Centre, UNSW Sydney, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.', 'Prince of Wales Clinical School, UNSW Sydney, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.', 'Adult Cancer Program, Lowy Cancer Research Centre, UNSW Sydney, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.', 'Prince of Wales Clinical School, UNSW Sydney, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.', 'Bioanalytical Mass Spectrometry Facility, UNSW Sydney, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.', 'Bioanalytical Mass Spectrometry Facility, UNSW Sydney, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.', 'Adult Cancer Program, Lowy Cancer Research Centre, UNSW Sydney, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.', 'Prince of Wales Clinical School, UNSW Sydney, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.', 'Climate Change Cluster, University of Technology Sydney, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.', 'Adult Cancer Program, Lowy Cancer Research Centre, UNSW Sydney, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.', 'Prince of Wales Clinical School, UNSW Sydney, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.', 'Adult Cancer Program, Lowy Cancer Research Centre, UNSW Sydney, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.', 'Prince of Wales Clinical School, UNSW Sydney, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.', 'Department of Pathology, School of Medical Sciences, UNSW Sydney, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.', 'Haematology Department, Prince of Wales Hospital, Randwick, New South Wales, Australia.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20171129,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,PMC5886051,,,2017/12/19 06:00,2019/03/21 06:00,['2017/12/19 06:00'],"['2017/09/11 00:00 [received]', '2017/11/19 00:00 [revised]', '2017/11/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/12/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/21 06:00 [medline]', '2017/12/19 06:00 [entrez]']","['leu2017340 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2017.340 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2018 Apr;32(4):900-910. doi: 10.1038/leu.2017.340.

However, the detailed mechanism of how SETD2-H3K36me3 downregulation accelerates MLLr leukemia remains unclear. Here, we show that in MLLr leukemia, both H3K79me2 and H3K36me3 are aberrantly elevated and co-enriched in a group of genes. SETD2 inactivation leads to a global reduction of H3K36me3 and a further elevation of H3K79me2, but does not change the expression of known MLL fusion target genes. Instead, this pattern of histone changes is associated with transcriptional deregulation of a novel set of genes; downregulating tumor suppressors (for example, ASXL1) and upregulating oncogenes (for example, ERG). Taken together, our findings reveal a global crosstalk between the oncogenic DOT1L-H3K79me2 axis and the tumor suppressive SETD2-H3K36me3 axis in gene regulation, provide molecular insights into how SETD2 mutations accelerate MLLr leukemogenesis through differential regulation of additional tumor suppressors and oncogenes.","['Bu, J', 'Chen, A', 'Yan, X', 'He, F', 'Dong, Y', 'Zhou, Y', 'He, J', 'Zhan, D', 'Lin, P', 'Hayashi, Y', 'Sun, Y', 'Zhang, Y', 'Xiao, Z', 'Grimes, H L', 'Wang, Q F', 'Huang, G']","['Bu J', 'Chen A', 'Yan X', 'He F', 'Dong Y', 'Zhou Y', 'He J', 'Zhan D', 'Lin P', 'Hayashi Y', 'Sun Y', 'Zhang Y', 'Xiao Z', 'Grimes HL', 'Wang QF', 'Huang G']","['Key Laboratory of Genomic and Precision Medicine, Collaborative Innovation Center of Genetics and Development, Beijing Institute of Genomics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.', ""Division of Pathology and Experimental Hematology and Cancer Biology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, USA."", 'University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Genomic and Precision Medicine, Collaborative Innovation Center of Genetics and Development, Beijing Institute of Genomics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.', ""Division of Pathology and Experimental Hematology and Cancer Biology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, USA."", ""Division of Pathology and Experimental Hematology and Cancer Biology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, USA."", 'Key Laboratory of Genomic and Precision Medicine, Collaborative Innovation Center of Genetics and Development, Beijing Institute of Genomics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.', ""Division of Pathology and Experimental Hematology and Cancer Biology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, USA."", ""Division of Pathology and Experimental Hematology and Cancer Biology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, USA."", 'Key Laboratory of Genomic and Precision Medicine, Collaborative Innovation Center of Genetics and Development, Beijing Institute of Genomics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Genomic and Precision Medicine, Collaborative Innovation Center of Genetics and Development, Beijing Institute of Genomics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.', ""Division of Pathology and Experimental Hematology and Cancer Biology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, USA."", 'University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.', ""Division of Pathology and Experimental Hematology and Cancer Biology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, USA."", ""Division of Pathology and Experimental Hematology and Cancer Biology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, USA."", 'Key Laboratory of Genomic and Precision Medicine, Collaborative Innovation Center of Genetics and Development, Beijing Institute of Genomics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.', 'University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.', ""Division of Pathology and Experimental Hematology and Cancer Biology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, USA."", 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', ""Division of Immunobiology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, USA."", 'Key Laboratory of Genomic and Precision Medicine, Collaborative Innovation Center of Genetics and Development, Beijing Institute of Genomics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.', 'University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.', ""Division of Pathology and Experimental Hematology and Cancer Biology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, USA.""]",['eng'],['R21 CA187276/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20171129,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,PMC6277029,,,2017/12/19 06:00,2019/03/21 06:00,['2017/12/19 06:00'],"['2017/06/29 00:00 [received]', '2017/10/31 00:00 [revised]', '2017/11/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/12/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/21 06:00 [medline]', '2017/12/19 06:00 [entrez]']","['leu2017339 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2017.339 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2018 Apr;32(4):890-899. doi: 10.1038/leu.2017.339.

There is conflicting evidence on the prognostic relevance of these clones for AML relapse. Here, we characterized paired pre-treatment and remission samples from 126 AML patients for mutations in 68 leukemia-associated genes. Fifty patients (40%) retained 1 mutation during remission at a variant allele frequency of 2%. Mutation persistence was most frequent in DNMT3A (65% of patients with mutations at diagnosis), SRSF2 (64%), TET2 (55%), and ASXL1 (46%), and significantly associated with older age (P<0.0001) and, in multivariate analyses adjusting for age, genetic risk, and allogeneic transplantation, with inferior relapse-free survival (hazard ratio, 2.34; P=0039) and overall survival (hazard ratio, 2.14; P=036). Patients with persisting mutations had a higher cumulative incidence of relapse before, but not after allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Our work underlines the relevance of mutation persistence during first remission as a novel risk factor in AML. Persistence of pre-leukemic clones may contribute to the inferior outcome of elderly AML patients. Allogeneic transplantation abrogated the increased relapse risk associated with persisting pre-leukemic clones, suggesting that mutation persistence may guide postremission treatment.Leukemia accepted article preview online, 18 December 2017. doi:10.1038/leu.2017.350.","['Rothenberg-Thurley, M', 'Amler, S', 'Goerlich, D', 'Kohnke, T', 'Konstandin, N P', 'Schneider, S', 'Sauerland, M C', 'Herold, T', 'Hubmann, M', 'Ksienzyk, B', 'Zellmeier, E', 'Bohlander, S K', 'Subklewe, M', 'Faldum, A', 'Hiddemann, W', 'Braess, J', 'Spiekermann, K', 'Metzeler, K H']","['Rothenberg-Thurley M', 'Amler S', 'Goerlich D', 'Kohnke T', 'Konstandin NP', 'Schneider S', 'Sauerland MC', 'Herold T', 'Hubmann M', 'Ksienzyk B', 'Zellmeier E', 'Bohlander SK', 'Subklewe M', 'Faldum A', 'Hiddemann W', 'Braess J', 'Spiekermann K', 'Metzeler KH']","['Laboratory for Leukemia Diagnostics, Department of Internal Medicine III, LMU Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Partner Site Munich, and German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Institute of Biostatistics and Clinical Research, WWU Munster, Munster, Germany.', 'Institute of Biostatistics and Clinical Research, WWU Munster, Munster, Germany.', 'Laboratory for Leukemia Diagnostics, Department of Internal Medicine III, LMU Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'Laboratory for Leukemia Diagnostics, Department of Internal Medicine III, LMU Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'Laboratory for Leukemia Diagnostics, Department of Internal Medicine III, LMU Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'Institute of Biostatistics and Clinical Research, WWU Munster, Munster, Germany.', 'Laboratory for Leukemia Diagnostics, Department of Internal Medicine III, LMU Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'Laboratory for Leukemia Diagnostics, Department of Internal Medicine III, LMU Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'Laboratory for Leukemia Diagnostics, Department of Internal Medicine III, LMU Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'Laboratory for Leukemia Diagnostics, Department of Internal Medicine III, LMU Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine and Pathology, University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand.', 'Laboratory for Leukemia Diagnostics, Department of Internal Medicine III, LMU Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Partner Site Munich, and German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Institute of Biostatistics and Clinical Research, WWU Munster, Munster, Germany.', 'Laboratory for Leukemia Diagnostics, Department of Internal Medicine III, LMU Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Partner Site Munich, and German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Oncology and Hematology, Hospital Barmherzige Bruder, Regensburg, Germany.', 'Laboratory for Leukemia Diagnostics, Department of Internal Medicine III, LMU Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Partner Site Munich, and German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Laboratory for Leukemia Diagnostics, Department of Internal Medicine III, LMU Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Partner Site Munich, and German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20171218,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,,,2017/12/19 06:00,2017/12/19 06:00,['2017/12/19 06:00'],"['2017/08/02 00:00 [received]', '2017/11/18 00:00 [revised]', '2017/11/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/12/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/12/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/19 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2017350 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2017.350 [doi]']",aheadofprint,Leukemia. 2017 Dec 18. pii: leu2017350. doi: 10.1038/leu.2017.350.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In aggressive SM (ASM) and MC leukemia (MCL), responses to conventional drugs are poor and the prognosis is dismal. R763 is a multi-kinase inhibitor that blocks the activity of Aurora-kinase-A/B, ABL1, AKT and FLT3. We examined the effects of R763 on proliferation and survival of neoplastic MC. R763 produced dose-dependent inhibition of proliferation in the human MC lines HMC-1.1 (IC50 5-50 nM), HMC-1.2 (IC50 1-10 nM), ROSA(KIT WT) (IC50 1-10 nM), ROSA(KIT D816V) (IC50 50-500 nM) and MCPV-1.1 (IC50 100-1000 nM). Moreover, R763 induced growth inhibition in primary neoplastic MC in patients with ASM and MCL. Growth-inhibitory effects of R763 were accompanied by signs of apoptosis and a G2/M cell cycle arrest. R763 also inhibited phosphorylation of KIT, BTK, AKT and STAT5 in neoplastic MC. The most sensitive target appeared to be STAT5. In fact, tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5 was inhibited by R763 at 10 nM. At this low concentration, R763 produced synergistic growth-inhibitory effects on neoplastic MC when combined with midostaurin or dasatinib. Together, R763 is a novel promising multi-kinase inhibitor that blocks STAT5 activation and thereby overrides drug-resistance in neoplastic MC.","['Peter, B', 'Bibi, S', 'Eisenwort, G', 'Wingelhofer, B', 'Berger, D', 'Stefanzl, G', 'Blatt, K', 'Herrmann, H', 'Hadzijusufovic, E', 'Hoermann, G', 'Hoffmann, T', 'Schwaab, J', 'Jawhar, M', 'Willmann, M', 'Sperr, W R', 'Zuber, J', 'Sotlar, K', 'Horny, H-P', 'Moriggl, R', 'Reiter, A', 'Arock, M', 'Valent, P']","['Peter B', 'Bibi S', 'Eisenwort G', 'Wingelhofer B', 'Berger D', 'Stefanzl G', 'Blatt K', 'Herrmann H', 'Hadzijusufovic E', 'Hoermann G', 'Hoffmann T', 'Schwaab J', 'Jawhar M', 'Willmann M', 'Sperr WR', 'Zuber J', 'Sotlar K', 'Horny HP', 'Moriggl R', 'Reiter A', 'Arock M', 'Valent P']","['Ludwig Boltzmann Cluster Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology & Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Laboratoire de Biologie et Pharmacologie Appliquee, CNRS UMR 8113, Ecole Normale Superieure de Cachan, Cachan, France.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Cluster Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology & Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Cancer Research, Institute of Animal Breeding and Genetics, University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology & Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology & Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Cluster Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology & Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Cluster Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Cluster Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology & Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department for Companion Animals and Horses, Clinical Unit of Internal Medicine, University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna,Austria.', 'Research Institute of Molecular Pathology (IMP), Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Medical Center Mannheim and Medical Faculty Mannheim, Heidelberg University, Mannheim, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Medical Center Mannheim and Medical Faculty Mannheim, Heidelberg University, Mannheim, Germany.', 'Department for Companion Animals and Horses, Clinical Unit of Internal Medicine, University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Cluster Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology & Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Research Institute of Molecular Pathology (IMP), Vienna, Austria.', 'University Institute of Pathology, University Hospital Salzburg, Paracelsus Medical University, Salzburg, Austria.', 'Institute of Pathology, Ludwig-Maximilians-University, Munich, Germany.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Cancer Research, Institute of Animal Breeding and Genetics, University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Medical Center Mannheim and Medical Faculty Mannheim, Heidelberg University, Mannheim, Germany.', 'Laboratoire de Biologie et Pharmacologie Appliquee, CNRS UMR 8113, Ecole Normale Superieure de Cachan, Cachan, France.', 'Laboratory of Hematology, Pitie-Salpetriere Hospital, Paris, France.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Cluster Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology & Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],"['F 4701/Austrian Science Fund FWF/Austria', 'F 4704/Austrian Science Fund FWF/Austria', 'F 4707/Austrian Science Fund FWF/Austria', 'F 4710/Austrian Science Fund FWF/Austria']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20171129,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,PMC6037300,,,2017/12/19 06:00,2019/03/21 06:00,['2017/12/19 06:00'],"['2017/06/20 00:00 [received]', '2017/10/31 00:00 [revised]', '2017/11/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/12/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/21 06:00 [medline]', '2017/12/19 06:00 [entrez]']","['leu2017338 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2017.338 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2018 Apr;32(4):1016-1022. doi: 10.1038/leu.2017.338.

In this study, we report the synthesis and biological activity of a new class of N-alkyl-isatin-3-iminobenzoic acid derivatives prepared via the condensation of N-alkyl isatin with 4-aminobenzoic acid by conventional, microwave, and ultrasonic methods. Microwave irradiation yielded the products in a shorter reaction time with higher yields and purities. The compounds were screened in zebrafish embryos, and also in three human cancer cell lines (MCF7, HepG2, and Jurkat) and one normal human cell line i.e., human foreskin cell line (HFF-1). Two compounds (3c, 3f) were found to be highly effective against hematopoiesis in live zebrafish embryo at 10 microM concentration. The developmental stage-dependent treatment indicated that these compounds interfered with the differentiation of hemangioblasts to hematopoietic cells in zebrafish embryos. The comparative screening of semaxanib (SU5416) (a known isatin derivatives), to compounds synthesized in this study, revealed the contrasting effects of these two classes of isatin derivatives on zebrafish hematopoiesis. Most of the N-alkyl-isatin-3-iminobenzoic acid derivatives were toxic on cancer and non-cancer tested human cells lines, however, the compounds 3c and 3f specifically affected the cell viability of Jurkat cells (human hematological cell line) with least IC50 values of 16.5 and 7.8 microM. The structure-activity relationship (SAR) analysis indicated that the substitution pattern of the isatin at the 5-position was vital for activity.

However, the mechanisms that mediate transformation in MPNs are not fully delineated, and clinically utilized JAK inhibitors have limited ability to reduce disease burden or reverse myelofibrosis. Here we show that MPN progenitor cells are characterized by marked alterations in gene regulation through differential enhancer utilization, and identify nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) signaling as a key pathway activated in malignant and non-malignant cells in MPN. Inhibition of BET bromodomain proteins attenuated NF-kappaB signaling and reduced cytokine production in vivo. Most importantly, combined JAK/BET inhibition resulted in a marked reduction in the serum levels of inflammatory cytokines, reduced disease burden, and reversed bone marrow fibrosis in vivo.","['Kleppe, Maria', 'Koche, Richard', 'Zou, Lihua', 'van Galen, Peter', 'Hill, Corinne E', 'Dong, Lauren', 'De Groote, Sofie', 'Papalexi, Efthymia', 'Hanasoge Somasundara, Amritha V', 'Cordner, Keith', 'Keller, Matthew', 'Farnoud, Noushin', 'Medina, Juan', 'McGovern, Erin', 'Reyes, Jaime', 'Roberts, Justin', 'Witkin, Matthew', 'Rapaport, Franck', 'Teruya-Feldstein, Julie', 'Qi, Jun', 'Rampal, Raajit', 'Bernstein, Bradley E', 'Bradner, James E', 'Levine, Ross L']","['Kleppe M', 'Koche R', 'Zou L', 'van Galen P', 'Hill CE', 'Dong L', 'De Groote S', 'Papalexi E', 'Hanasoge Somasundara AV', 'Cordner K', 'Keller M', 'Farnoud N', 'Medina J', 'McGovern E', 'Reyes J', 'Roberts J', 'Witkin M', 'Rapaport F', 'Teruya-Feldstein J', 'Qi J', 'Rampal R', 'Bernstein BE', 'Bradner JE', 'Levine RL']","['Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, 1275 York Avenue, Box 20, New York, NY 10065, USA; Center for Epigenetics Research, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Center for Epigenetics Research, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Center for Epigenetics Research, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Department of Pathology Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, 1275 York Avenue, Box 20, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, 1275 York Avenue, Box 20, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, 1275 York Avenue, Box 20, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, 1275 York Avenue, Box 20, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, 1275 York Avenue, Box 20, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, 1275 York Avenue, Box 20, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, 1275 York Avenue, Box 20, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA; Center for Hematologic Malignancies, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Center for Hematologic Malignancies, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Center for Hematologic Malignancies, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, 44 Binney Street, Boston, MA 02115, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, 44 Binney Street, Boston, MA 02115, USA.', 'Center for Epigenetics Research, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, 1275 York Avenue, Box 20, New York, NY 10065, USA; Center for Hematologic Malignancies, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Icahn School of Medicine, Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, 44 Binney Street, Boston, MA 02115, USA.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, 1275 York Avenue, Box 20, New York, NY 10065, USA; Leukemia Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Pathology Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, 44 Binney Street, Boston, MA 02115, USA.

We show here that R-2HG also exerts a broad anti-leukemic activity in vitro and in vivo by inhibiting leukemia cell proliferation/viability and by promoting cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis. Mechanistically, R-2HG inhibits fat mass and obesity-associated protein (FTO) activity, thereby increasing global N(6)-methyladenosine (m(6)A) RNA modification in R-2HG-sensitive leukemia cells, which in turn decreases the stability of MYC/CEBPA transcripts, leading to the suppression of relevant pathways. Ectopically expressed mutant IDH1 and S-2HG recapitulate the effects of R-2HG. High levels of FTO sensitize leukemic cells to R-2HG, whereas hyperactivation of MYC signaling confers resistance that can be reversed by the inhibition of MYC signaling. R-2HG also displays anti-tumor activity in glioma. Collectively, while R-2HG accumulated in IDH1/2 mutant cancers contributes to cancer initiation, our work demonstrates anti-tumor effects of 2HG in inhibiting proliferation/survival of FTO-high cancer cells via targeting FTO/m(6)A/MYC/CEBPA signaling.","['Su, Rui', 'Dong, Lei', 'Li, Chenying', 'Nachtergaele, Sigrid', 'Wunderlich, Mark', 'Qing, Ying', 'Deng, Xiaolan', 'Wang, Yungui', 'Weng, Xiaocheng', 'Hu, Chao', 'Yu, Mengxia', 'Skibbe, Jennifer', 'Dai, Qing', 'Zou, Dongling', 'Wu, Tong', 'Yu, Kangkang', 'Weng, Hengyou', 'Huang, Huilin', 'Ferchen, Kyle', 'Qin, Xi', 'Zhang, Bin', 'Qi, Jun', 'Sasaki, Atsuo T', 'Plas, David R', 'Bradner, James E', 'Wei, Minjie', 'Marcucci, Guido', 'Jiang, Xi', 'Mulloy, James C', 'Jin, Jie', 'He, Chuan', 'Chen, Jianjun']","['Su R', 'Dong L', 'Li C', 'Nachtergaele S', 'Wunderlich M', 'Qing Y', 'Deng X', 'Wang Y', 'Weng X', 'Hu C', 'Yu M', 'Skibbe J', 'Dai Q', 'Zou D', 'Wu T', 'Yu K', 'Weng H', 'Huang H', 'Ferchen K', 'Qin X', 'Zhang B', 'Qi J', 'Sasaki AT', 'Plas DR', 'Bradner JE', 'Wei M', 'Marcucci G', 'Jiang X', 'Mulloy JC', 'Jin J', 'He C', 'Chen J']","['Department of Cancer Biology, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH 45219, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH 45219, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH 45219, USA; Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Malignancies, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang 310003, China.', 'Department of Chemistry, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Institute for Biophysical Dynamics, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637, USA.', ""Division of Experimental Hematology and Cancer Biology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH 45229, USA."", 'Department of Cancer Biology, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH 45219, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH 45219, USA; School of Pharmacy, China Medical University, Shenyang, Liaoning 110001, China.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH 45219, USA; Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Malignancies, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang 310003, China.', 'Department of Chemistry, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Institute for Biophysical Dynamics, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637, USA; College of Chemistry and Molecular Sciences, Key Laboratory of Biomedical Polymers of Ministry of Education, Wuhan University, Hubei, Wuhan 430072, China.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH 45219, USA; Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Malignancies, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang 310003, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Malignancies, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang 310003, China.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH 45219, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Institute for Biophysical Dynamics, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH 45219, USA; Depart of Gynecologic Oncology, Chongqing Cancer Institute and Hospital and Cancer Center, Chongqing 400030, China.', 'Department of Chemistry, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Institute for Biophysical Dynamics, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Institute for Biophysical Dynamics, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH 45219, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH 45219, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH 45219, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH 45219, USA.', 'Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, City of Hope, 1500 E.

NK cell-like activity for all three species was most effective against the mouse lymphoma cell line YAC-1, compared to the human leukemia cell line K562; NK cell response displayed the characteristic increase in cytotoxic activity when the effector:target cell ratio increased. Comparing NK activity between fresh and cryopreserved mouse lymphocytes revealed little to no difference in function, highlighting the applicability of cryopreserving cells in field studies.

Normal CBF function is essential for activity of AML1-ETO, product of the t(8;21), and for survival of several leukemias lacking RUNX1 mutations. Using virtual screening and optimization, we developed Runt domain inhibitors which bind to the Runt domain and disrupt its interaction with CBFbeta. On-target activity was demonstrated by the Runt domain inhibitors' ability to depress hematopoietic cell formation in zebrafish embryos, reduce growth and induce apoptosis of t(8;21) AML cell lines, and reduce progenitor activity of mouse and human leukemia cells harboring the t(8;21), but not normal bone marrow cells. Runt domain inhibitors had similar effects on murine and human T cell acute lymphocytic leukemia (T-ALL) cell lines. Our results confirmed that Runt domain inhibitors might prove efficacious in various AMLs and in T-ALL.","['Oo, Zaw Min', 'Illendula, Anuradha', 'Grembecka, Jolanta', 'Schmidt, Charles', 'Zhou, Yunpeng', 'Esain, Virginie', 'Kwan, Wanda', 'Frost, Isaura', 'North, Trista E', 'Rajewski, Roger A', 'Speck, Nancy A', 'Bushweller, John H']","['Oo ZM', 'Illendula A', 'Grembecka J', 'Schmidt C', 'Zhou Y', 'Esain V', 'Kwan W', 'Frost I', 'North TE', 'Rajewski RA', 'Speck NA', 'Bushweller JH']","['a Abramson Family Cancer Research Institute , Philadelphia , PA , USA.', 'b Department of Cell and Molecular Biology , University of Pennsylvania , Philadelphia , PA , USA.', 'c Department of Molecular Physiology and Biological Physics , University of Virginia , Charlottesville , VA , USA.', 'd Department of Pathology , University of Michigan , Ann Arbor , MI , USA.', 'c Department of Molecular Physiology and Biological Physics , University of Virginia , Charlottesville , VA , USA.', 'c Department of Molecular Physiology and Biological Physics , University of Virginia , Charlottesville , VA , USA.', 'e Department of Pathology , Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School , Boston , MA , USA.', 'e Department of Pathology , Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School , Boston , MA , USA.', 'e Department of Pathology , Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School , Boston , MA , USA.', 'e Department of Pathology , Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School , Boston , MA , USA.', 'f Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry , University of Kansas , Lawrence , KS , USA.', 'a Abramson Family Cancer Research Institute , Philadelphia , PA , USA.', 'b Department of Cell and Molecular Biology , University of Pennsylvania , Philadelphia , PA , USA.', 'c Department of Molecular Physiology and Biological Physics , University of Virginia , Charlottesville , VA , USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA108056/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA149976/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK098241/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20171218,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,PMC6005736,['NOTNLM'],"['*AML1-ETO', '*CBFB', '*Leukemia', '*PPI', '*RUNX', '*TEL-AML1', '*protein-protein interaction inhibitor']",2017/12/19 06:00,2019/03/19 06:00,['2017/12/19 06:00'],"['2017/12/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/19 06:00 [medline]', '2017/12/19 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10428194.2017.1410882 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2018 Sep;59(9):2188-2200. doi: 10.1080/10428194.2017.1410882.

Here, we describe a case in which this type of EFE was diagnosed with vitreous sampling and was successfully treated with 25-gauge vitrectomy and antifungals, including liposomal amphotericin B and voriconazole. A 16-year-old male patient undergoing treatment for acute myeloid leukemia complained of eye pain and blurred vision in his right eye. Treatment was initiated for a vitreous opacity, possibly associated with herpetic retinitis, but the patient worsened and he was referred to us. Right-eye visual acuity was limited to light perception. We suspected endogenous endophthalmitis and performed 25-gauge vitrectomy with antibiotic perfusion of ceftazidime, vancomycin, and voriconazole. Vitreous culturing revealed the presence of Fusarium solani species complex, and enhanced computed tomography revealed disseminated fusariosis lesions in the lung, spleen, and the soft tissue of the left upper arm. The patient received antifungal treatment with liposomal amphotericin B and voriconazole, and these conditions were eliminated. Visual acuity recovered to 20/400 after additional vitrectomy for tractional retinal detachment and was maintained at this level during the 6-month follow-up period. The success of our treatment allowed the capture of optical coherence tomography images of the retina during fusarium-associated endogenous endophthalmitis and the follow-up period. Furthermore, this case showed that immediate vitrectomy for suspected EFE and intensive treatment can lead to a good clinical outcome.","['Yoshida, Masaaki', 'Kiyota, Naoki', 'Maruyama, Kazuichi', 'Kunikata, Hiroshi', 'Toyokawa, Masahiro', 'Hagiwara, Shigehiro', 'Makimura, Koichi', 'Sato, Naomi', 'Taniuchi, Shinji', 'Nakazawa, Toru']","['Yoshida M', 'Kiyota N', 'Maruyama K', 'Kunikata H', 'Toyokawa M', 'Hagiwara S', 'Makimura K', 'Sato N', 'Taniuchi S', 'Nakazawa T']","['Department of Ophthalmology, Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine, 1-1, Seiryo-machi, Aoba-ku, Sendai, Miyagi, 980-8574, Japan.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine, 1-1, Seiryo-machi, Aoba-ku, Sendai, Miyagi, 980-8574, Japan.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine, 1-1, Seiryo-machi, Aoba-ku, Sendai, Miyagi, 980-8574, Japan. kazuichi.maruyama@ophthal.med.osaka-u.ac.jp.', 'Department of Innovative Visual Science, Osaka University Medical School, 2-2 Yamadaoka, Suita, Osaka, 565-0871, Japan. kazuichi.maruyama@ophthal.med.osaka-u.ac.jp.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine, 1-1, Seiryo-machi, Aoba-ku, Sendai, Miyagi, 980-8574, Japan.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Tohoku University Hospital, Sendai, Japan.', 'Preparing Section for New Faculty of Medical Science, Fukushima Medical University, Fukushima, Japan.', 'Teikyo University Institute of Medical Mycology, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Teikyo University Institute of Medical Mycology, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Tohoku University Hospital, Sendai, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Tohoku University Hospital, Sendai, Japan.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine, 1-1, Seiryo-machi, Aoba-ku, Sendai, Miyagi, 980-8574, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20171216,Netherlands,Mycopathologia,Mycopathologia,7505689,,['NOTNLM'],"['Endogenous fungal endophthalmitis', 'Fusarium solani', 'Optical coherence tomography', 'Vitrectomy', 'Vitreous sampling']",2017/12/19 06:00,2018/08/25 06:00,['2017/12/18 06:00'],"['2017/08/02 00:00 [received]', '2017/11/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/12/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/08/25 06:00 [medline]', '2017/12/18 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s11046-017-0221-x [doi]', '10.1007/s11046-017-0221-x [pii]']",ppublish,Mycopathologia. 2018 Apr;183(2):451-457. doi: 10.1007/s11046-017-0221-x.

The pathway to cellular recovery has been difficult to study in human beings because of risks associated with interventions during aplasia. We investigated whether (18)F-fluorothymidine ((18)F-FLT) imaging was safe during allogenic HSCT and allowed visualisation of early cellular proliferation and detection of patterns of cellular engraftment after HSCT. METHODS: Eligible patients were aged 18-55 years, had high-risk haematological malignancies. All patients underwent myeloablation followed by HSCT. The imaging primary endpoint was detection of early subclinical engraftment after HSCT with (18)F-FLT PET or CT. Imaging was done 1 day before and 5 or 9, and 28 days, and 1 year after HSCT. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01338987. FINDINGS: Between April 1, 2014, and Dec 31, 2015, 23 patients were enrolled and assessable for toxic effects after completing accrual. (18)F-FLT was not associated with any adverse events or delayed engraftment. (18)F-FLT imaging objectively identified subclinical bone-marrow recovery within 5 days of HSC infusion, which was up to 20 days before engraftment became clinically evident. Quantitatively, (18)F-FLT intensity differed significantly between myeloablative infusion before HSCT and subclinical HSC recovery (p=0.00031). (18)F-FLT biodistribution over time revealed a previously unknown path of cellular recovery of haemopoiesis in vivo that mirrored fetal ontogeny. INTERPRETATION: (18)F-FLT allowed quantification and tracking of subclinical bone-marrow repopulation in human beings and revealed new insights into the biology of HSC recovery after HSCT.

Mitogen activated kinase kinase 7 (MKK7) is involved in the development of cardiac injury and is a component of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signal transduction pathway. Apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) is the upstream activator of MKK7 and is specifically inhibited by 2,7-dihydro-2,7-dioxo-3H-naphtho[1,2,3-de]quinoline-1-carboxylic acid ethyl ester (NQDI-1). This study investigates the role of ASK1, MKK7 and JNK during Sunitinib-induced cardiotoxicity. Infarct size were measured in isolated male Sprague-Dawley rat Langendorff perfused hearts treated for 125min with Sunitinib in the presence and absence of NQDI-1. Left ventricular cardiac tissue samples were analysed by qRT-PCR for MKK7 mRNA expression and cardiotoxicity associated microRNAs (miR-1, miR-27a, miR-133a and miR-133b) or Western blot analysis to measure ASK1/MKK7/JNK phosphorylation. Administration of Sunitinib (1muM) during Langendorff perfusion resulted in increased infarct size, increased miR-133a expression, and decreased phosphorylation of the ASK1/MKK7/JNK pathway compared to control. Co-administration of NQDI-1 (2.5muM) attenuated the increased Sunitinib-induced infarct size, reversed miR-133a expression and restored phosphorylated levels of ASK1/MKK7/JNK. These findings suggest that the ASK1/MKK7/JNK intracellular signalling pathway is important in Sunitinib-induced cardiotoxicity. The anti-cancer properties of Sunitinib were also assessed using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) cell viability assay. Sunitinib significantly decreased the cell viability of human acute myeloid leukemia 60 cell line (HL60). The combination of Sunitinib (1nM-10muM) with NQDI-1 (2.5muM) enhanced the cancer-fighting properties of Sunitinib. Investigations into the ASK1/MKK7/JNK transduction pathway could lead to development of cardioprotective adjunct therapy, which could prevent Sunitinib-induced cardiac injury.","['Cooper, Samantha Louise', 'Sandhu, Hardip', 'Hussain, Afthab', 'Mee, Christopher', 'Maddock, Helen']","['Cooper SL', 'Sandhu H', 'Hussain A', 'Mee C', 'Maddock H']","['Faculty Research Centre for Sport, Exercise and Life Sciences, Faculty of Health and Life Sciences, Science & Health Building, 20 Whitefriars Street, Coventry, CV1 2DS, United Kingdom.

This systematic review and clinical trial landscape identifies and critiques published CAR-T cell clinical trials and examines the critical factors required to enable CAR-T cells to become a standard therapy. A review of the literature was conducted to identify suitable studies from the MEDLINE and Ovid bibliographic databases. The literature and database searches identified 20 studies for inclusion. The average number of participants per clinical trial examined was 11 patients. All studies included in this systematic review investigated CAR-T cells and were prospective, uncontrolled clinical studies. Leukemia is the most common cancer subtype and accounts for 57.4% (n = 120) of disease indications. The majority of studies used an autologous cell source (85%, n = 17) rather than an allogeneic cell source. Translational challenges encompass technical considerations relating to CAR-T cell development, manufacturing practicability, clinical trial approaches, CAR-T cell quality and persistence, and patient management.","['Pettitt, David', 'Arshad, Zeeshaan', 'Smith, James', 'Stanic, Tijana', 'Hollander, Georg', 'Brindley, David']","['Pettitt D', 'Arshad Z', 'Smith J', 'Stanic T', 'Hollander G', 'Brindley D']","['The Oxford - UCL Centre for the Advancement of Sustainable Medical Innovation (CASMI), The University of Oxford, Oxford, UK; Department of Paediatrics, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.', 'University of Cambridge School of Medicine, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.

Clinical candidates are N-substituted derivatives of the dual LSD1-/monoamine oxidase-inhibitor tranylcypromine (2-PCPA) with a basic amine function in the N-substituent. These derivatives are selective over monoamine oxidases. So far, only very limited information on structure-activity studies about this important class of LSD1 inhibitors is published in peer reviewed journals. Here, we show that N-substituted 2-PCPA derivatives without a basic function or even a polar group are still potent inhibitors of LSD1 in vitro and effectively inhibit colony formation of leukemic cells in culture. Yet, these lipophilic inhibitors also block the structurally related monoamine oxidases (MAO-A and MAO-B), which may be of interest for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders, but this property is undesired for applications in cancer treatment. The introduction of a polar, non-basic function led to optimized structures that retain potent LSD1 inhibitors but exhibit selectivity over MAOs and are highly potent in the suppression of colony formation of cultured leukemic cells. Cellular target engagement is shown via a Cellular Thermal Shift Assay (CETSA) for LSD1.","['Schulz-Fincke, Johannes', 'Hau, Mirjam', 'Barth, Jessica', 'Robaa, Dina', 'Willmann, Dominica', 'Kurner, Andreas', 'Haas, Julian', 'Greve, Gabriele', 'Haydn, Tinka', 'Fulda, Simone', 'Lubbert, Michael', 'Ludeke, Steffen', 'Berg, Tobias', 'Sippl, Wolfgang', 'Schule, Roland', 'Jung, Manfred']","['Schulz-Fincke J', 'Hau M', 'Barth J', 'Robaa D', 'Willmann D', 'Kurner A', 'Haas J', 'Greve G', 'Haydn T', 'Fulda S', 'Lubbert M', 'Ludeke S', 'Berg T', 'Sippl W', 'Schule R', 'Jung M']","['Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Freiburg, Germany; German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Freiburg, Germany; German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Freiburg, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Frankfurt, Germany; German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Institute of Pharmacy, Martin-Luther-University of Halle-Wittenberg, Germany.', 'Department of Urology and Center for Clinical Research, University of Freiburg Medical Center, Germany.', 'Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Freiburg, Germany; German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Freiburg, Germany; German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Freiburg, Germany.', 'Division of Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Freiburg Medical Center, Germany; Faculty of Biology, University of Freiburg, Germany.', 'Institute for Experimental Cancer Research in Pediatrics, Goethe-University Frankfurt, Germany; German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Frankfurt, Germany; German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Institute for Experimental Cancer Research in Pediatrics, Goethe-University Frankfurt, Germany; German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Frankfurt, Germany; German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Division of Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Freiburg Medical Center, Germany; German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Freiburg, Germany.', 'Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Freiburg, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Frankfurt, Germany; German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Institute of Pharmacy, Martin-Luther-University of Halle-Wittenberg, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Freiburg, Germany; Department of Urology and Center for Clinical Research, University of Freiburg Medical Center, Germany; BIOSS Centre of Biological Signalling Studies, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany; K-metics GmbH, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Freiburg, Germany; K-metics GmbH, Freiburg, Germany.

Most studies have shown more relapse, less nonrelapse mortality (NRM), and similar overall survival after reduced-intensity and myeloablative conditioning. There are limited data on the dose equivalence and expected outcomes of treosulfan-based compared with busulfan-based conditioning. We compared SCT outcomes after fludarabine with either intravenous busulfan at a myeloablative dose (FB4, 12.8 mg/kg, n = 1265) or a reduced dose (FB2, 6.4 mg/kg, n = 1456) or treosulfan at 42 g/m(2) (FT14, n = 403) or 36 g/m(2) (FT12, n = 168). Median patient age was 48, 60, 57, and 60 years in the FB4, FB2, FT14, and FT12 groups, respectively (P < .0001). Two-year overall survival was 58%, 53%, 53%, and 51%, respectively (P = .25). Multivariate analysis identified advanced age, advanced disease status, and secondary leukemia to be associated with worse survival. Relapse rate was 30%, 35%, 34%, and 40%, respectively. Relapse was more common after FB2, advanced age and disease status, secondary leukemia, and sibling donors. NRM was 17%, 18%, 21%, and 16%, respectively. NRM was least common after FT12 and more common with advanced age and disease status and unrelated donors. Treosulfan-based regimens were associated with lower rates of graft-versus-host disease. There was no difference in any outcome among patients in first complete remission at transplantation. However, there was better survival with treosulfan-based conditioning in advanced leukemia. In conclusion, survival is determined mostly by disease biology and is similar after various regimens. Treosulfan-based conditioning is more similar to myeloablative than to reduced-intensity conditioning but can be administered safely in older patients, with lower rates of graft-versus-host disease and possibly better outcomes in patients with active leukemia.","['Shimoni, Avichai', 'Labopin, Myriam', 'Savani, Bipin', 'Hamladji, Rose-Marie', 'Beelen, Dietrich', 'Mufti, Ghulam', 'Socie, Gerard', 'Delage, Jeremy', 'Blaise, Didier', 'Chevallier, Patrice', 'Forcade, Edouard', 'Deconinck, Eric', 'Mohty, Mohamad', 'Nagler, Arnon']","['Shimoni A', 'Labopin M', 'Savani B', 'Hamladji RM', 'Beelen D', 'Mufti G', 'Socie G', 'Delage J', 'Blaise D', 'Chevallier P', 'Forcade E', 'Deconinck E', 'Mohty M', 'Nagler A']","['Division of Hematology, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel-Hashomer and Sackler Medical School Tel-Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.

Data from 145 Ph+ ALL patients were analyzed retrospectively. Patients were treated with imatinib plus chemotherapy and then transplantation or continuous TKIs with chemotherapy based on patient preference. A total of 145 Ph+ ALL patients were recruited for this study (median age, 37 years; range, 14 to 65). Among these patients, 81 were men (55.9%) and 86 underwent IKZF1 detection, which identified 59 patients (68.6%) with IKZF1 deletions. After treatment 136 patients (95.8%) achieved complete remission (CR) eventually. With a median follow-up of 33 months (range, 4 to 114) for CR patients, 77 patients (57.9%) underwent transplantation and 56 (42.1%) received continuous TKIs with chemotherapy. At the 4-year follow-up the cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR), disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS) were 29.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 24.9% to 34.4%), 60.9% (95% CI, 56.5% to 65.3%), and 69.2% (95% CI, 65.1% to 73.3%), respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that WBC counts < 30 x 10(9)/L at diagnosis (hazard ratio [HR], 4.2; 95% CI, 1.9 to 9.2; P < .001; HR, 2.6; 95% CI, 1.4 to 4.9; P = .003; HR, 2.7; 95% CI, 1.4 to 5.4; P = .003), 3-log reduction of BCR-ABL levels from baseline after 2 consolidation cycles (HR, 4.4; 95% CI, 1.9 to 9.9; P < .001; HR, 3.1; 95% CI, 1.7 to 5.9; P < .001; HR, 3.5; 95% CI, 1.9 to 8.7; P = .001; defined as ""minimal residual disease low level""), and transplantation (HR, 5.0; 95% CI, 2.2 to 11.2; P < .001; HR, 3.3; 95% CI, 1.7 to 6.4; P < .001; HR, 4.1; 95% CI, 1.9 to 8.7; P < .001) were the favorable factors of CIR, DFS, and OS. According to the first 2 risk factors, CR patients were divided into 3 groups: low risk (no factor, n = 42, 31.6%), intermediate risk (1 factor, n = 73, 54.9%), and high risk (2 factors, n = 18, 13.5%). In the low-risk group at the 4-year follow up no significant difference existed between the transplant and nontransplant arms for the probabilities of CIR (8.5% versus 7.7%, P = .671), DFS (88.2% versus 83.9%, P = .426), and OS (96.6% versus 83.3%, P = .128). In the intermediate- and high-risk groups at the 4-year follow-up, CIR (23.6% versus 36.9%, P = .017; 37.5% versus 100.0%, P <.001), DFS (62.4% versus 43.8%, P = .048; 56.2% versus 0%, P <.001), and OS (76.1% versus 47.7%, P = .037; 51.4% versus 6.3%, P = .001) rates were significantly better in the transplant arm than in the nontransplant arm. In surviving patients of the low-risk group, no difference in complete molecular response (CMR) rates (85.7% versus 72.7%, P = .379) between the transplant and nontransplant arms was found.

We performed a cardiometabolic assessment of cALL survivors from the PETALE cohort (n = 247, median age at visit of 21.7 years). In our group, overweight and obesity affected over 70% of women. Pre-hypertension and hypertension were mostly common in men, both adults (20%) and children (19%). Prediabetes was mainly present in women (6.1% of female adult survivors) and 41.3% had dyslipidemia. Cranial radiation therapy was a predictor of dyslipidemia (RR: 1.60, 95% CI: 1.07-2.41) and high LDL-cholesterol (RR: 4.78, 95% CI: 1.72-13.28). Male gender was a predictor for pre-hypertension and hypertension (RR: 5.12, 95% CI: 1.81-14.46). Obesity at the end of treatment was a predictor of obesity at interview (RR: 2.07, 95% CI: 1.37-3.14) and of metabolic syndrome (RR: 3.04, 95% CI: 1.14-8.09). Compared to the general population, cALL survivors were at higher risk of having the metabolic syndrome, dyslipidemia, pre-hypertension/hypertension and high LDL-cholesterol, while the risk for obesity was not different.

These inhibitors have limitations, including the paucity of complete responses, acquired resistance, and toxicity. Here, we examined the mechanism by which the cyclic-AMP/PDE4 signaling axis suppresses PI3K, toward identifying a novel mechanism-based combinatorial strategy to attack BCR-dependency in mature B-cell malignancies.Experimental Design: We used in vitro and in vivo diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) cell lines and primary chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) samples to preclinically evaluate the effects of the combination of the FDA-approved phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) inhibitor roflumilast and idelalisib on cell survival and tumor growth. Genetic models of gain- and loss-of-function were used to map multiple signaling intermediaries downstream of the BCR.Results: Roflumilast elevates the intracellular levels of cyclic-AMP and synergizes with idelalisib in suppressing tumor growth and PI3K activity. Mechanistically, we show that roflumilast suppresses PI3K by inhibiting BCR-mediated activation of the P85 regulatory subunit, distinguishing itself from idelalisib, an ATP-competitive inhibitor of the catalytic P110 subunit. Using genetic models, we linked the PDE4-regulated modulation of P85 activation to the oncogenic kinase SYK.Conclusions: These data demonstrate that roflumilast and idelalisib suppress PI3K by distinct mechanisms, explaining the basis for their synergism, and suggest that the repurposing of PDE4 inhibitors to treat BCR-dependent malignancies is warranted.

We hypothesized that antitumor-cell responses could be enhanced by the addition of lenalidomide to the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 inhibitor ipilimumab.Experimental Design: We conducted a phase II investigator-initiated trial to assess the safety and activity of ipilimumab and lenalidomide in patients with lymphoid malignancies that relapsed after allogeneic HSCT and in high-risk patients after autologous HSCT. Patients received 10 mg of oral lenalidomide daily for 21 days followed by intravenous ipilimumab at 3 mg/kg bodyweight. The regimen was repeated 4 weeks later for a total of four treatments.Results: We enrolled 17 patients (10 allogeneic and seven autologous transplant recipients). Immune-mediated toxicity was limited to one patient with asymptomatic hypothyroidism and one with dermatitis in the allogeneic and autologous groups, respectively. One allogeneic transplant recipient had a flare of prior GVHD while taking lenalidomide that precluded further treatment. All others finished treatment without GVHD. Four of 10 patients in the allogeneic group had complete responses (three of which were durable at 19+, 21+, and 32+ months), and three had partial responses. The disease in six of seven patients in the autologous group remains in remission. The groups had similar immune responses, including a two- to threefold increase in inducible ICOS(+)CD4(+)FoxP3(-) T-cell number.Conclusions: Our early-phase data suggested that ipilimumab plus lenalidomide is well tolerated after HSCT.

The elevation of CK2 and PIM-1 in cells entails suppression of apoptosis and implies a protective role for the kinases against cell death. Downregulation of these enzymes by chemical methods promotes apoptosis in cells. The aim of the present study was to explore the anticancer activity of inhibitors of protein kinases CK2 and PIM-1 on neoplastic cell lines in vitro. We studied a series of deoxynucleosides with various tetrahalobenzimidazoles as aglycone moiety. Cytotoxicity, induction of apoptosis by the tested inhibitors, mitochondrial membrane potential, activity of caspases, changes in cell cycle progression, as well as a mechanism of action were determined by flow cytometry and other methods. The results indicate that the studied compounds, e.g., 1-(beta-D-2'-deoxyribofuranosyl)-4,5,6,7-tetrabromo-1H-benzimidazole called K164 (also termed TDB), showed diverse cytotoxicity and proapoptotic efficacy in cell lines. Our results showed that the tested compounds are potential anticancer agents for targeted therapy, particularly in the treatment of myeloid leukaemia and androgen-responsive prostate cancer.","['Koronkiewicz, Miroslawa', 'Chilmonczyk, Zdzislaw', 'Kazimerczuk, Zygmunt', 'Orzeszko, Andrzej']","['Koronkiewicz M', 'Chilmonczyk Z', 'Kazimerczuk Z', 'Orzeszko A']","['Department of Cell Biology, National Medicines Institute, Chelmska St. 30/34, 00-725 Warsaw, Poland.
