METHODS: The authors describe a child with ALL who experienced a relapse involving the inferior rectus muscle of the eye. This patient had been treated with a bone marrow transplant for previous bone marrow and ovarian relapse. RESULTS: The patients had a pre-B ALL with a t(1;19) chromosomal translocation and previously had experienced relapse during therapy. At the time of the muscle relapse, she had pancreatomegaly consistent with leukemic infiltration but no CNS or bone marrow disease. CONCLUSIONS: Relapse of ALL in unusual sites may indicate disease that is particularly difficult to eradicate. Factors in addition to age and leukocyte count at diagnosis determined risk. Additional research is needed to define these factors and develop more effective therapy.","['Hinkle, A S', 'Dinndorf, P A', 'Bulas, D I', 'Kapur, S']","['Hinkle AS', 'Dinndorf PA', 'Bulas DI', 'Kapur S']","[""Department of Hematology/Oncology, Children's National Medical Center, George Washington University School of Medicine and Health Sciences, Washington, DC 20010.""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemic Infiltration/*pathology', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/pathology', 'Oculomotor Muscles/*pathology', 'Ovary/pathology', 'Pancreas/pathology', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*pathology']",1994/03/15 00:00,1994/03/15 00:01,['1994/03/15 00:00'],"['1994/03/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/03/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/03/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19940315)73:6<1757::aid-cncr2820730634>3.0.co;2-m [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1994 Mar 15;73(6):1757-60. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19940315)73:6<1757::aid-cncr2820730634>3.0.co;2-m.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A number of controversies surround (a) the use of combination versus monotherapy for initial empiric administration; (b) the use of vancomycin as part of the initial regimen; (c) the origin of Staphylococcus epidermidis infections (i.e., mostly from vascular catheters or mostly from the alimentary canal); (d) the use of acyclovir for herpes simplex prophylaxis during remission induction for acute leukemia patients not undergoing bone marrow transplantation; (e) the use of alimentary canal microbial suppression or reverse isolation in a room with laminar air flow, or both, as infection prevention techniques. Current recommendations and observations include the following. (a) Monotherapy with ceftazidime or imipenem is effective and appropriate for patients with moderate granulocytopenia at limited risk for infection with a resistant organism. Combination therapy is recommended for patients with profound, persistent granulocytopenia who are at high risk for gram-negative bacteremia; such bacteremic patients have a better prognosis with combined-modality therapy. (b) Vancomycin need not be included in the initial regimen although some centers may choose to do so because of the high prevalence of gram-positive bacteremias. (c) Despite the ubiquitous presence of indwelling vascular catheters, most S. epidermidis infections among neutropenic patients originate from along the alimentary canal. (d) Herpes simplex infection is much more common following standard remission induction chemotherapy than previously recognized. Acyclovir will reduce these infections and concurrently probably reduce the likelihood of resultant bacterial/fungal co-infections and superinfections. (e) Selective microbial suppression is appropriate for patients expected to experience prolonged (more than 2 weeks) or profound (below 100 granulocytes/microliters) granulocytopenia. Agents chosen should suppress aerobic but not anaerobic flora (maintain colonization resistance) and need to have an effect on both the oral cavity and esophagus as well as the intestines.","['Schimpff, S C', 'Scott, D A', 'Wade, J C']","['Schimpff SC', 'Scott DA', 'Wade JC']","['University of Maryland Medical System, Baltimore 21201.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Germany,Support Care Cancer,Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer,9302957,IM,"['Anti-Bacterial Agents/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Bacterial Infections/*prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Mycoses/prevention & control', '*Neoplasms', 'Neutropenia', 'Virus Diseases/prevention & control']",1994/03/01 00:00,1994/03/01 00:01,['1994/03/01 00:00'],"['1994/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00572090 [doi]'],ppublish,Support Care Cancer. 1994 Mar;2(2):94-104. doi: 10.1007/BF00572090.,['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)'],['Support Care Cancer. 1995 Jan;3(1):84-5.

The value of the support that they provide to both families and schools is clearly reflected in the ease with which children reintegrate into their school environment after what can be, for some, a prolonged absence.","['Gregory, K', 'Parker, L', 'Craft, A W']","['Gregory K', 'Parker L', 'Craft AW']","['Department of Child Health, University of Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",England,Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Pediatric hematology and oncology,8700164,IM,"['Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'England', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*therapy', '*Social Adjustment', 'Students/*psychology', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/08880019409141907 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 1994 Jan-Feb;11(1):105-9. doi: 10.3109/08880019409141907.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The principal goal of this dosimetry study was to determine whether area (i.e., spot and/or 24 h) measurements of power-frequency magnetic fields in the residences and in the schools and daycare centers of 29 children (4 months through 8 years of age) could be used to predict their measured personal 24-h exposures. TWA personal exposures, measured with AMEX-3D meters worn by subjects, were approximately log-normally distributed with both residential and nonresidential geometric means of 0.10 microT (1.0 mG). Between-subjects variability in residential personal exposure levels (geometric standard deviation of 2.4) was substantially greater than that observed for nonresidential personal exposure levels (1.4). The correlation between log-transformed residential and total personal exposure levels was 0.97. Time-weighted averages of the magnetic fields measured in children's bedrooms, family rooms, living rooms, and kitchens were highly correlated with residential personal exposure levels (r = 0.90). In general, magnetic field levels measured in schools and daycare centers attended by subjects were smaller and less variable than measured residential fields and were only weakly correlated with measured nonresidential personal exposures. The final measurement protocol, which will be used in a large US study examining the relationship between childhood leukemia and exposure to magnetic fields, contains the following elements: normal- and low-power spot magnetic field measurements in bedrooms occupied by subjects during the 5 years prior to the date of diagnosis for cases or the corresponding date for controls; spot measurements under normal and low power-usage conditions at the centers of the kitchen and the family room; 24-h magnetic-field recordings near subjects' beds; and wire coding using the Wertheimer-Leeper method.","['Kaune, W T', 'Darby, S D', 'Gardner, S N', 'Hrubec, Z', 'Iriye, R N', 'Linet, M S']","['Kaune WT', 'Darby SD', 'Gardner SN', 'Hrubec Z', 'Iriye RN', 'Linet MS']","['Enertech Consultants, Campbell, California.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Bioelectromagnetics,Bioelectromagnetics,8008281,IM,"['Child', '*Child Day Care Centers', 'Child, Preschool', 'District of Columbia', '*Environmental Exposure', '*Housing', 'Humans', 'Infant', '*Magnetics', '*Schools']",1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/bem.2250150108 [doi]'],ppublish,Bioelectromagnetics. 1994;15(1):33-51. doi: 10.1002/bem.2250150108.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: A detailed analysis of this patient's clinical illness, immunologic factors, neuroradiographic findings, and brain histopathologic conditions was undertaken. The medical literature on PML complicating congenital immunodeficient states was also reviewed. SETTING: A 1500-bed, university-affiliated, public health hospital. PATIENT: A 15-year-old boy with Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome. His neurologic illness was heralded by dysarthria and right-sided weakness and the diagnosis was established by brain biopsy specimen. Survival from the time of onset of PML was 10 months. CONCLUSION: Although PML typically occurs in the setting of severe acquired cellular immunodeficiency, often as a consequence of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, organ transplantation, and leukemia and lymphoma, it may rarely accompany inherited immunodeficiency syndromes. The reported childhood cases of PML include three patients, aged 5, 11, and 18 years, with other inherited immunodeficiency syndromes. This patient represents the first time (to our knowledge) that PML has been reported to occur in association with Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome.","['Katz, D A', 'Berger, J R', 'Hamilton, B', 'Major, E O', 'Post, M J']","['Katz DA', 'Berger JR', 'Hamilton B', 'Major EO', 'Post MJ']","['Department of Neurology, University of Miami School of Medicine, Fla.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Arch Neurol,Archives of neurology,0372436,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Brain/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukoencephalopathy, Progressive Multifocal/complications/immunology/*pathology', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome/complications/*pathology']",1994/04/01 00:00,1994/04/01 00:01,['1994/04/01 00:00'],"['1994/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1001/archneur.1994.00540160128016 [doi]'],ppublish,Arch Neurol. 1994 Apr;51(4):422-6. doi: 10.1001/archneur.1994.00540160128016.,,,,,['P01 NS25569/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: A multicenter, randomized, controlled trial. PATIENTS: 876 febrile, neutropenic episodes in 696 patients (83% acute leukemia or bone marrow transplantation); 92 episodes were excluded from analysis because of protocol violation. INTERVENTIONS: Patients received either intravenous ceftazidime (2 g every 8 h) or piperacillin (12 to 18 g/d in 4 to 6 divided doses plus tobramycin (1.7 to 2.0 mg/kg body weight every 8 h). Treatment could be modified at any time at the discretion of the investigator. MEASUREMENTS: Percentage of satisfactory response, eradication of the infecting organism, development of superinfections, and occurrence of adverse events. RESULTS: As a single agent, ceftazidime was as effective as the combination of piperacillin and tobramycin (62.7% satisfactory responses compared with 61.1%; odds ratio, 1.07%; 95% Cl, 0.79 to 1.44; P > 0.2). Equivalent responses were also obtained in episodes of profound neutropenia (odds ratio, 0.76; Cl, 0.43 to 1.33; P > 0.2). Infectious mortality was 6% for ceftazidime and 8% for the combination therapy. Eradication of the infecting organisms was achieved in 79% of bacteremic episodes treated with ceftazidime compared with 68% of the episodes treated with the combination therapy (odds ratio, 1.76; Cl, 0.92 to 3.38; P = 0.08), and rates for gram-negative rod bacteremia were also similar (95% compared with 77%; odds ratio, 5.25; Cl, 1.0 to 27.5; P = 0.03). Superinfections developed in 38 episodes in each group. An adverse event occurred in 8% of episodes treated with ceftazidime compared with 20% of episodes treated with combination therapy (P < 0.001).

Lack of a requirement for graft adaptation for maintenance of specific renal allograft tolerance.,794-9,"In miniature swine, one-haplotype class I disparate renal allografts are accepted without exogenous immunosuppression by approximately 35% of recipients. Alternatively, transplants bearing a two-haplotype class I mismatch are always rejected acutely. However, long-term acceptance in the latter animals can be achieved uniformly with a 12-day course of cyclosporine. In vitro studies of recipient cell-mediated lymphocytotoxicity responses have shown donor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte clones in tolerant animals, suggesting that tolerance may be a local phenomenon or a central phenomenon activated in the milieu of the graft. Six animals were retransplanted with kidneys MHC-matched to their original allograft to determine whether (1) tolerance is a central phenomenon; (2) host tolerance can be broken with a fresh challenge of donor antigen and antigen-presenting cells; and (3) graft adaptation is required for maintenance of tolerance. Four of the retransplanted animals had been spontaneous acceptors of one-haplotype class I-disparate grafts and two had been rendered tolerant to two-haplotype class I-mismatched kidneys with CsA induction. All six explanted allografts showed no histological evidence of rejection and all six retransplants were accepted without exogenous immunosuppression. These findings suggest that in miniature swine tolerance of class I-disparate kidneys is a stable, centrally mediated phenomenon that cannot be broken with a challenge of fresh donor antigen and donor-type APCs. Furthermore, successful retransplantation without immunosuppression in animals receiving CsA induction therapy for their first transplant suggests that graft adaptation is not necessary for the maintenance of tolerance.","['Rosengard, B R', 'Fishbein, J M', 'Gianello, P', 'Ojikutu, C A', 'Guzzetta, P C', 'Smith, C V', 'Sundt, T M 3rd', 'Nakajima, K', 'Hill, G S', 'Sachs, D H']","['Rosengard BR', 'Fishbein JM', 'Gianello P', 'Ojikutu CA', 'Guzzetta PC', 'Smith CV', 'Sundt TM 3rd', 'Nakajima K', 'Hill GS', 'Sachs DH']","['Transplantation Biology Research Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston 02129.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Transplantation,Transplantation,0132144,IM,"['Animals', 'Graft Rejection/genetics', 'Haplotypes', 'Immune Tolerance', 'Kidney Transplantation/*immunology/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/immunology', 'Reoperation', 'Skin Transplantation/immunology', 'Swine', 'Swine, Miniature']",1994/03/27 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1994/03/27 00:00'],"['1994/03/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1994/03/27 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Transplantation. 1994 Mar 27;57(6):794-9.,,,,,"['AI-31156/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-18646/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The conspicuity of hepatic lesions was evaluated semiquantitatively and ranked on a three-point scale. RESULTS: Multiple liver lesions were seen as high-signal-intensity foci with the STIR sequence; other sequences showed equivocal results. In the semiquantitative evaluation, STIR was significantly (P < .001) superior to both T1-weighted SE and contrast-enhanced FLASH techniques.

Several models suggest that DNA single-strands and loops may serve as intermediates in the process of illegitimate recombination. Guanine-rich, repetitive elements are preferred sites of chromosomal exchange and can undergo conformational changes which result in the generation of single-stranded DNA. Here we describe a single-stranded DNA-binding protein which binds specifically to guanine-rich elements at the breakpoints of human reciprocal translocations, including the t(14;18), t(2;8), t(9;22), t(15;17) and t(4;11) in leukemia and lymphoma. The primitive binding consensus consists of two guanine-residues on either side separated by a spacer of at least two nucleotides (GGN-NGG). Binding activity is unaltered by a spacer length of up to 46 nucleotides.

TAL2 potentially encodes a basic helix-loop-helix motif that is highly related to those specified by TAL1 and LYL1, distinct genes that have also been implicated in T-ALL. In this report we show that leukemic cells bearing the (7;9) (q34;q32) translocation express a TAL2 gene product of 108 amino acids. In leukemic cells this product exists in both a phosphorylated (pp13TAL2) and an unphosphorylated (p12TAL2) form. Serine residue 100 is the major site of TAL2 phosphorylation in vivo, and it serves as an effective in vitro substrate for mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases such as ERK1. TAL2 polypeptides interact in vivo with the E2A gene products (E47 and E12) to form bHLH heterodimers that bind DNA in a sequence-specific manner. The TAL2 polypeptides do not bind DNA by themselves, however, suggesting that their functional properties may be contingent upon association with other bHLH proteins. Taken together, the properties of TAL2 evaluated here broadly resemble those described previously for TAL1, and therefore support the idea that both proteins promote T-ALL by a common mechanism.","['Xia, Y', 'Hwang, L Y', 'Cobb, M H', 'Baer, R']","['Xia Y', 'Hwang LY', 'Cobb MH', 'Baer R']","['Department of Microbiology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas 75235.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Helix-Loop-Helix Motifs', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/genetics/*metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/05/01 00:00,1994/05/01 00:01,['1994/05/01 00:00'],"['1994/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncogene. 1994 May;9(5):1437-46.,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (TAL2 protein, human)']",,,,['CA44016/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['TAL2'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

We examined c-ski expression in four different myeloid cell lines which can be induced to differentiate by exposure to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). Two of the cell lines are multipotent and have the ability to differentiate into either erythrocytes or megakaryocytes (K562 and HEL cells), one cell line differentiates exclusively into megakaryocytes (CHRF-288-11), and the fourth cell line differentiates into either monocytes or granulocytes (HL-60). Our findings indicate that c-ski mRNA is up regulated by PMA only in those cell lines which respond by differentiating along the megakaryocyte lineage. The extent of differentiation and the observed increase in c-ski mRNA levels are positively correlated with the PMA concentration used to induce differentiation. Experiments in which CHRF-288-11 cells were treated with the protein kinase C (PKC) activator bryostatin 1 indicate that c-ski mRNA induction is not a general effect of PKC activation.

These viruses, isolated from cells of one chicken infected with Rous Associated virus 1 (RAV-1), had captured c-erbB sequences as a consequence of RAV-1 integration into the host genome. Their genome structures were distinct; however, their v-erbB genes had sustained identical 5' and 3' deletions and the v-erbB-env junctions were identical at the nucleotide level. The results therefore strongly suggest that all five viruses originate from the same capture event. Sequence analyses of the v-erbB genes from three of these viruses revealed that one of them had undergone no further mutation and lacked detectable capacity to transform cells, therefore probably representing an 'early' form of transducing virus. The two other v-erbB genes contained distinct mutations and differed in their potential to induce fibroblast- and erythroblast transformation; they therefore probably represent later derivatives of the virus that captured the erbB oncogene. The data suggest that the initial retrovirus rapidly underwent many alterations after capture of c-erbB sequences, already in the RAV-1 infected bird as well as during subsequent in vitro isolation procedures. The changes involve both major rearrangements of the genome as well as point mutations that activated the erbB oncogene.","['Vennstrom, B', 'Raynoscheck, C', 'Jansson, L', 'Doederlein, G', 'Lhotak, V', 'Johnsson, A', 'Beug, H']","['Vennstrom B', 'Raynoscheck C', 'Jansson L', 'Doederlein G', 'Lhotak V', 'Johnsson A', 'Beug H']","['Department of Molecular Biology, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Avian Leukosis Virus/chemistry/*genetics/growth & development/metabolism', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Transformation, Viral/*genetics', 'Chick Embryo', 'Chickens', 'ErbB Receptors/analysis/genetics/metabolism', '*Gene Deletion', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Genes, gag/genetics', '*Genome, Viral', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/genetics/microbiology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/analysis/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogenes/*genetics', 'Proviruses/chemistry/genetics', 'RNA, Viral/chemistry/*genetics', 'Virus Activation']",1994/05/01 00:00,1994/05/01 00:01,['1994/05/01 00:00'],"['1994/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncogene. 1994 May;9(5):1307-20.,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)']",,,,,"['c-erbB', 'gag', 'v-erbB', 'v-erbB<up>B1</up>', 'v-erbB<up>p1</up>']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

While its curability is inversely related to the tumor burden, a relevant number of patients still progress to metastatic disease even after adjuvant chemotherapy. Also, high-dose chemotherapy appears promising, but can not yet be considered ultimately curative of breast cancer. Different variables, biological, kinetic and treatment-related, account for the clinical behaviour of this disease. In order to improve its curability, they will all need to be taken into account in planning future treatment strategies. One of the most effective ways to understand and predict the clinical behaviour of breast cancer is the development of appropriate mathematical models explaining its growth-patterns. Aim of this paper is to review the two fundamental models, the exponential and the Gompertzian. The exponential model is at the basis of the Skipper-Schabel and the Goldie-Coldman hypotheses, while the Norton-Simon hypothesis has been formulated from the gompertzian model. The latter appears to better fit the vast amount of clinical data which are presently available: from Bloom's analysis of untreated breast cancer patients, to the results of large clinical trials, to the data emerged from the recent meta-analysis. Characteristic of a gompertzian growth pattern is that exponential growth is matched by exponential retardation of growth. In 1943 Delbruck and Luria demonstrated that random mutations could account for the development of virus resistance in bacteria and were able to estimate the rate of mutation as a function of the growth rate of bacteria. Shortly after Law demonstrated that resistance to methotrexate in murine leukemia occurred similarly. The concept of combination chemotherapy actually derived from the idea that cancer cells could be resistant to chemotherapy even before exposure to it. Goldie and Coldman applied the Delbruck/Luria model to hypothesize the use of non cross-resistant alternating combination chemotherapy as a better way to eliminate the risk of resistance. They also suggested that many different drugs were to be used as soon as possible, when the tumor size is still small. Most of their predictions were based on the Skipper/Schabel model of the exponential growth of cancer and on its deriving log-kill model. A large amount of clinical data are now suggesting that the behaviour of breast cancer is best described by gompertzian growth: in particular, gompertzian growth is a tenable model of breast cancer growth for both the unperturbed and the perturbed (by treatment) states.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Surbone, A', 'Norton, L']","['Surbone A', 'Norton L']","['Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York.']",['ita'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Italy,Minerva Med,Minerva medica,0400732,IM,"['Breast Neoplasms/*pathology/therapy', 'Cell Division', 'Drug Resistance', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Mathematics', 'Models, Biological', 'Neoplasms/pathology']",1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Minerva Med. 1994 Jan-Feb;85(1-2):7-16.,,,60,,,,Le basi cinetiche delle neoplasie mammarie.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Growth and the timing of puberty were studied in 179 girls who had been treated for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden. The patients were divided into two groups according to mode of CNS prophylaxis: with or without cerebral irradiation. Longitudinal analysis of 103 patients showed no difference in prepubertal growth in irradiated and nonirradiated girls. Growth during puberty was normal in girls without irradiation and below normal in irradiated girls. There was no difference in growth between girls after 24 Gy or 20 Gy of cerebral irradiation. Irradiated girls had a final height which was one SD less than expected before puberty and menarche occurred one year earlier than in the nonirradiated girls. Prophylactic cerebral irradiation is the most important factor for subnormal growth after treatment for ALL. There is no short-term influence on growth but the effects of irradiation become apparent several years after therapy when girls enter puberty somewhat early and have a subnormal pubertal growth. Growth and growth hormone (GH) levels should be evaluated several years after CNS irradiation, and treatment with GH and/or luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) analogues may be considered.","['Moell, C', 'Marky, I', 'Hovi, L', 'Kristinsson, J', 'Rix, M', 'Moe, P J', 'Garwicz, S']","['Moell C', 'Marky I', 'Hovi L', 'Kristinsson J', 'Rix M', 'Moe PJ', 'Garwicz S']","['Dept. of Paediatrics, University Hospital, Lund, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Med Pediatr Oncol,Medical and pediatric oncology,7506654,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Cranial Irradiation/*adverse effects', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', 'Growth/*radiation effects', 'Humans', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Menarche/radiation effects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*radiotherapy', 'Puberty/*radiation effects']",1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/mpo.2950220604 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Pediatr Oncol. 1994;22(6):375-9. doi: 10.1002/mpo.2950220604.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Malignant cells acquiring apoptosis-resistance, still can be killed by cytotoxic lymphocytes releasing lymphotoxins. This phenomenon gives further support to the therapeutic use of activated and expanded lymphocyte populations and/or apoptosis-inducing cytokines. Chemotherapeutic agents (esp. topoisomerase inhibitors) frequently kill tumor cells by activating programmed cell death (PCD). Biologicals and chemotherapeutics may synergize in evoking apoptosis.

Superimposable results are obtained on blast cells from APL.

In an HTLV-I endemic area in Japan, the seroprevalence of HTLV-I in idiopathic uveitis was 38%, while those in uveitis with defined etiology and in non-uveitic ocular diseases were 10% and 19%, respectively. Strikingly, the HTLV-I seroprevalence in younger aged patients (20-49 years) with idiopathic uveitis was 49%, while only 8% in the control group (P < 0.001). A very similar observation was recorded even in HTLV-I less endemic area, suggesting that HTLV-I infection plays a role as a risk factor for idiopathic uveitis. Clinical analysis revealed that an intermediate uveitis characterized by moderate opacities in the vitreous body and retinal vasculitis was seen in the majority the patients. The proviral DNA of HTLV-I was detected from inflammatory cells in the eye of all tested patients using PCR technique.

Evidence suggests that Tax is incapable of directly interacting with DNA; therefore, Tax most likely regulates transcription via interaction with cellular factors. In addition to a role in Tax-mediated trans-activation, cellular factors are also critical elements in basal HTLV-I LTR-directed transcription. Therefore, characterization of cellular factors which interact with the 21 bp repeat elements is essential to understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in both basal and Tax-mediated transcription from the HTLV-I LTR. Utilizing electrophoretic mobility shift (EMS) analyses, we have detected 21 bp repeat-specific DNA-protein complexes when nuclear extracts derived from cells of lymphoid (Jurkat, SupT1, and H9) and monocytoid (U937) origin were reacted with each of the three 21 bp repeat elements. Furthermore, results from EMS competition analyses utilizing unlabeled 21 bp repeats as competitor DNAs have indicated a difference in the ability of each unlabeled 21 bp repeat to compete for the specific DNA-protein complexes formed between the nuclear extracts and radiolabeled 21 bp repeats. In each case, the most effective competitor was the homologous, unlabeled 21 bp repeat element.

However, groups of cord blood-positive children and seroconverted children were distinct each other. Therefore, the presence of HTLV-1 provirus in the cord blood can not be a marker of intrauterine infection. Mothers who infected a child has approximately 10 times higher risk of another infection for the next baby than those who did not.","['Hino, S', 'Katamine, S', 'Kawase, K', 'Miyamoto, T', 'Doi, H', 'Tsuji, Y', 'Yamabe, T']","['Hino S', 'Katamine S', 'Kawase K', 'Miyamoto T', 'Doi H', 'Tsuji Y', 'Yamabe T']","['Faculty of Medicine, Tottori University, Yonago, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Breast Feeding', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Fetal Blood/microbiology', 'HTLV-I Infections/diagnosis/prevention & control/*transmission', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Pregnancy', '*Pregnancy Complications, Infectious/diagnosis/prevention & control', 'Retrospective Studies']",1994/04/01 00:00,1994/04/01 00:01,['1994/04/01 00:00'],"['1994/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1994 Apr;8 Suppl 1:S68-70.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this region, which is well recognized by sera from HTLV-I infected patients, a substitution of the proline at position 192 by a serine has been described in some isolates. Because this mutation could modify the secondary structure of the glycoprotein molecule, we studied the inference of the presence of proline or serine on the recognition of the region 175-199 by human sera. For this, three peptides have been synthetized (a 25-mer 175-199 corresponding to the sequence of the ATK prototype, and two internal 10-mer 190-Pro-199 and 190-Ser-199 having a proline or a serine at position 192) and tested by immunosorbent assay. While most sera reacted with 190-Pro-199 and with 190-Ser-199 synthetic peptides, a differential recognition was observed according to the pathology associated to HTLV-I infection. Moreover sera corresponding to patients infected with a virus harboring a serine at position 192 were found to recognize only the 10-mer with a serine.

Leukemic cells of an ATL patient with HLA-A2, whose PBMC did not show an HTLV-I-specific CTL response, could be lyzed by p40tax-specific CTL derived from an HAM/TSP patient. This indicates that i) the presence of a certain HLA presenting CTL epitopes is not the sole determinant of the individual CTL response to HTLV-I, ii) HTLV-I-specific CTL act as potential effectors of anti-tumor surveillance in vivo. The role of HTLV-I-specific CTL, however, may be limited by another in vivo mechanism suppressing the expression of HTLV-I antigens.

EBV is also etiologically associated with African Burkitt's lymphoma, Hodgkin's Disease, and nasopharyngeal cancer. EBV transformed, latently infected B lymphocytes contain EBV episomes and eight virus encoded proteins. Six are nuclear proteins (EBNAs) and two are the integral membrane proteins, LMP1 and LMP2. These eight proteins are presumed to mediate latent virus infection or B lymphocyte proliferation and are thus under intense scrutiny. Besides EBNA1, which is required for episome maintenance, LMP1 and LMP2, are the two transformation associated proteins that are most consistently detected in EBV related malignancies, and the LMP2 message is the only message detected in PCR analysis of B lymphocytes from individuals harboring EBV latent infections. LMP2 associates with src family tyrosine kinases, a 70 kda cell phosphoprotein, LMP1 and several other unidentified cell proteins. LMP1 is a key mediator of EBV's effects on inducing B lymphocyte activation and adhesion molecules and is a transforming oncogene in rodent fibroblasts. The association of these two EBV encoded membrane proteins could create a macromolecular complex mediating constitutive B lymphocyte activation through normal cell signal transduction pathways. LMP2 might may control activation of lytic replication or down regulate the activation state of EBV infected cells allowing persistence in the human host.","['Longnecker, R']",['Longnecker R'],"['Northwestern Medical School, Chicago, IL 60611.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antigens, Viral/genetics/*physiology', 'B-Lymphocytes/physiology', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Viral Matrix Proteins/genetics/*physiology']",1994/04/01 00:00,1994/04/01 00:01,['1994/04/01 00:00'],"['1994/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1994 Apr;8 Suppl 1:S46-50.,"['0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (EBV-associated membrane antigen, Epstein-Barr virus)', '0 (Viral Matrix Proteins)']",,69,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hence the disease has been considered to be an appropriate experimental model for MDS-like myelodysplasia, sequential pathological changes in the development of the disease are introduced in the report. Huge splenomegaly was the major gross abnormality, which developed with 100% frequency; neither hepato-renal, nor other thymico-lymphatic involvement was common. During the progressive increase in splenic weight, extensive proliferation of multi-lineage hemopoiesis was prominent, although no differences were apparent in the cellular proportions of each hematopoietic element compared with normal spleens, either in flow-cytometric analysis using markers for each subset of hematopoietic elements, or in the histological findings. In the later phases of the disease, the proliferating cell type tended to shift to a variety of single to oligo-lineage hemopoiesis, but the majority of mice still showed the presence of multi-lineage hemopoiesis; histologically, such hemopoiesis was somewhat dysplastic, but had no apparent nature of leukemic infiltration. Several transplantation-assays essentially supported the low neoplastic potential of proliferating cells even in later phase. A long-term observation was made aiming to induce more frequent transition of this abnormal hemopoiesis into a single-lineage neoplasm by transplantation of pre-onset spleen cells, as well as bone-marrow cells from transgenic mice at an early phase of the disease, into lethally irradiated C57BL/6 mice. This trial resulted in a variety of neoplastic growths in the recipients; not only was myelodysplastic hypercellularity seen, but also, single-lineage hemopoietic malignancies, such as B-cell lymphomas/leukemias, histiocytic malignancies, and even myeloid leukemias. The transition from multi-lineage myelodysplasia into single lineage hemopoiesis at some frequency is reminiscent of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) in humans. Higher frequency of transition into lymphoid malignancies may be due partly to the immunoglobulin enhancer used as a promoter unit. The results that the SV40 large T antigen was expressed in every proliferating cells, there was no apparent increase in multi-CSFs activity; together with the results of the transplantation assays suggest that the hyperproliferation of the cells is directly induced by the expression of SV40 large T antigen in the hemopoietic cells themselves.","['Inoue, T', 'Hirabayashi, Y', 'Mitsui, H', 'Furuta, Y', 'Suda, Y', 'Aizawa, S', 'Ikawa, Y']","['Inoue T', 'Hirabayashi Y', 'Mitsui H', 'Furuta Y', 'Suda Y', 'Aizawa S', 'Ikawa Y']","['Department of Pathology, Yokohama City University Medical School, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Polyomavirus Transforming/*physiology', '*Enhancer Elements, Genetic', '*Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred ICR', 'Mice, Nude', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*etiology', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Simian virus 40/*immunology']",1994/04/01 00:00,1994/04/01 00:01,['1994/04/01 00:00'],"['1994/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1994 Apr;8 Suppl 1:S202-5.,"['0 (Antigens, Polyomavirus Transforming)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Treatment of CLL cells from 2 patients with 4-HC for 30 min followed by dAdo/dCF for 18 hr resulted in little synergistic cytotoxicity, although this drug combination did produce an additive cell kill.

While spontaneous apoptosis occurred in CLL cells incubated in vitro in the absence of drug, the level of apoptosis, as measured by the extent of DNA fragmentation, was greater in cells treated with chlorambucil. In addition, macrophages were shown to engulf drug treated CLL cells in vitro. To determine if chlorambucil can also induce apoptosis in vivo, CLL cells were isolated from patients before treatment and at intervals after clinical therapy with chlorambucil (0.9 mg/kg given over 3 days). Apoptosis was measured in these cells immediately after isolation and following incubation in vitro for 72 hr. No apoptotic changes were detected in cells immediately after isolation either before or after clinical treatment. In contrast, apoptosis was observed in cells that were incubated ex vivo for 72 hr, and the level of apoptosis was greater in cells that were isolated after chlorambucil treatment compared with cells obtained prior to therapy. The increased apoptosis observed in CLL cells ex vivo after therapy was related to the fall in the patient's lymphocyte count. In general, a large increase in apoptosis ex vivo after treatment was followed by a significant decrease in the patient's lymphocyte count. Thus, chlorambucil may produce its antitumor effect in CLL by inducing apoptosis-associated membrane changes that result in rapid clearance of the apoptotic cells by the immune system.","['Begleiter, A', 'Lee, K', 'Israels, L G', 'Mowat, M R', 'Johnston, J B']","['Begleiter A', 'Lee K', 'Israels LG', 'Mowat MR', 'Johnston JB']","['Manitoba Cancer Treatment and Research Foundation, Winnipeg, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chlorambucil/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'DNA/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/pathology']",1994/04/01 00:00,1994/04/01 00:01,['1994/04/01 00:00'],"['1994/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1994 Apr;8 Suppl 1:S103-6.,"['18D0SL7309 (Chlorambucil)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chromosome translocations: dangerous liaisons.,S1-6,"Rearrangements involving chromosome band 11q23 are very common in acute leukemia, both lymphoblastic and myeloid (monoblastic), and are less common in lymphoma. Although several different genes have been cloned from 11q23 translocation breakpoints, the great majority involve the MLL (myeloid-lymphoid leukemia) gene. The MLL gene has several different names, ALL1, Htrx, HRX; the central part of the gene codes for multiple zinc fingers which show strong homology to the Drosophila trithorax gene. MLL is involved in four common translocations as well as in 25 uncommon or rare translocations, insertions and deletions. The translocation breakpoints occur within an 8.3kb region which can be detected with a 0.7 kb cDNA probe. Twenty-five percent of patients have a deletion 3' of the breakpoint which includes the zinc finger region. Patients who previously received drugs that inhibit topoisomerase II often develop acute leukemia with translocations involving 11q23. These translocations break MLL in the same 8.3kb region. In the four breakpoints cloned to date, the translocation has led to a fusion gene on the derivative 11 chromosome with a chimeric transcript, consisting of 5' MLL and the 3' segment of the other gene. Although transcripts were also cloned from the other derivative chromosome, all the evidence indicates that the critical fusion gene is on the derivative 11 chromosome. The molecular dissection of these rearrangements will provide insights into the biology of MLL and into the interaction of MLL with topoisomerase II inhibitors. In addition, this research has provided DNA probes that will be important for diagnosis and for monitoring patients during the course of their disease.","['Rowley, J D']",['Rowley JD'],"['Section of Hematology/Oncology, University of Chicago Medical Center, IL 60637-1470.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Chromosome Mapping', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1994/04/01 00:00,1994/04/01 00:01,['1994/04/01 00:00'],"['1994/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1994 Apr;8 Suppl 1:S1-6.,,,42,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In an attempt to correlate these biologic abnormalities and the presence of the p210bcr/abl protein, we initiated studies to identify differences in proteins constitutively phosphorylated on tyrosine in whole cell lysates of comparable primary early blast subpopulations derived from normal and Ph+ chronic phase CML marrows. Immunoblotting with anti-P-tyr Abs demonstrated a prominent 62 kDa phosphotyrosyl protein (pp62) constitutively present in 11/11 Ph+ chronic phase linblasts while being virtually undetectable in equivalent amounts of protein derived from 15/15 and 2/2 comparable normal and Ph-negative chronic phase blast populations, respectively. Immunoblotting with an Ab reportedly specific for the ras GTPase activating protein (GAP) associated p62 protein revealed that the pp62 present in CML blasts is not immunologically related to the former protein. Although the identity of the pp62 is presently not known, its prominent presence in chronic phase CML blasts, in which the only known molecular abnormality is putatively the p210bcr/abl protein, strongly suggests that it may be a critical p210bcr/abl substrate involved in an early stage of expansion of the Ph+ clone.","['Wisniewski, D', 'Strife, A', 'Wojciechowicz, D', 'Lambek, C', 'Clarkson, B']","['Wisniewski D', 'Strife A', 'Wojciechowicz D', 'Lambek C', 'Clarkson B']","['Sloan-Kettering Institute for Cancer Research, New York, New York.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Blast Crisis/pathology', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/pathology', 'Molecular Weight', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*analysis/chemistry', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/pharmacology']",1994/04/01 00:00,1994/04/01 00:01,['1994/04/01 00:00'],"['1994/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1994 Apr;8(4):688-93.,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)']",,,,"['NCI CA20194/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'NCI P30-CA-08748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The effect of OPF was investigated on whole blood of ten normal donors, and on separated blasts of 17 leukemic patients. OPF fixation for 45 min to 24 h maintained the morphology of lymphoid cells with minimal cellular distortion and scatter changes, and only slightly modified cell surface immunoreactivity. For at least 1 week following fixation, the cells were still suitable for immunostaining with monoclonal antibodies that recognize the main lymphoid populations. These included CD3, CD4 and CD8 for T-cell subsets, CD19 and CD16 for B lymphocytes and NK cells, and CD45 for leukocyte common antigen (LCA). The OPF fixation of leukemic cells allowed the simultaneous detection of nuclear TdT in conjunction with membrane CD19, and with membrane and/or cytoplasmic CD22 in common-ALL, as well as with cytoplasmic CD3 in T-ALL cases. Our findings suggest that with the introduction of this new fixative into the routine laboratory service, a number of convenient and practical arrangements can be made which increase the efficiency of immunodiagnosis. Small laboratories with no inhouse flow-cytometric facilities can now accumulate OPF-treated whole blood samples for at least 3-4 days and send these to reference laboratories. In addition, the immunodiagnosis of acute leukemia is greatly facilitated by combination staining for membrane and intracellular antigens both at diagnosis and when the analysis of minority populations is warranted for detecting minimal disease.","['Pizzolo, G', 'Vincenzi, C', 'Nadali, G', 'Veneri, D', 'Vinante, F', 'Chilosi, M', 'Basso, G', 'Connelly, M C', 'Janossy, G']","['Pizzolo G', 'Vincenzi C', 'Nadali G', 'Veneri D', 'Vinante F', 'Chilosi M', 'Basso G', 'Connelly MC', 'Janossy G']","['Department of Haematology, Verona University School of Medicine, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Antigens, Surface/*analysis', 'Cell Nucleus/immunology', 'Cytoplasm/immunology', 'Fixatives/*pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*immunology']",1994/04/01 00:00,1994/04/01 00:01,['1994/04/01 00:00'],"['1994/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1994 Apr;8(4):672-6.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Fixatives)']",['Leukemia. 1995 Jan;9(1):226-8.

Oxidation of VCR involves a ring fission between positions 20' and 21', and is thought to be facilitated by the presence of an hydroxyl (-OH) group at position 20'. We report here two different approaches, both with potential clinical application, to decrease MPO-catalyzed vinca degradation. Firstly, we tested the hypothesis that -OH substitution at position 20' increases vinca susceptibility to peroxidation by comparing the relative extent of degradation of vinorelbine (Navelbine or NVB), which lacks a 20' hydroxyl substitution, with that of VCR. As anticipated, NVB was significantly less susceptible to MPO-catalyzed peroxidation than was VCR (p < 0.01). Secondly, we screened an array of compounds that are in current clinical use for their ability to inhibit MPO. Acetaminophen, N-acetylcysteine, propylthiouracil, D-penicillamine, mefenamic acid, dapsone, and methimazole all inhibited MPO at clinically achievable concentrations.

However, by a sensitive immunocytochemical assay, EU-1 cells additionally displayed several myeloid antigens (CD13, CD14, CD33) not detected by flow-cytometry. Furthermore, EU-1 cells were cytochemically and immunocytochemically negative for myeloperoxidase (MPO) but positive for MPO mRNA by Northern blot analysis. After incubation with dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), myeloid cell surface antigens were detected on EU-1 cells by flow cytometry, and a marked decrease in MPO mRNA expression was observed.

Immunophenotyping of marrow blasts and peripheral lymphocytes was positive for CD56, CD2 and CD7, and negative for CD3. Cytotoxicity of peripheral blood mononuclear cells at an effector: target (E:T) cell ratio of 50:1 was 79% against K562 cells and 48% against Daudi cells. To establish the line, cells from the peripheral blood were placed into enriched alpha medium containing 12.5% fetal calf serum, 12.5% horse serum, 10(-4) M beta-mercaptoethanol and 10(-6) M hydrocortisone. Growth of the line (termed NK-92) is dependent on the presence of recombinant IL-2 and a dose as low as 10 U/ml is sufficient to maintain proliferation. Conversely, cells die within 72 h when deprived of IL-2; IL-7 and IL-12 do not maintain long-term growth, although IL-7 induces short-term proliferation measured by 3H-thymidine incorporation. None of the other cytokines tested (IL-1 alpha, IL-6, TNF-alpha, IFN-alpha, IFN-gamma) supported growth of NK-92 cells which have the following characteristics: surface marker positive for CD2, CD7, CD11a, CD28, CD45, CD54, CD56bright; surface marker negative for CD1, CD3, CD4, CD5, CD8, CD10, CD14, CD16, CD19, CD20, CD23, CD34, HLA-DR. DNA analysis showed germline configuration for T-cell receptor beta and gamma genes. CD25 (p55 IL-2 receptor) is expressed on about 50% of all cells when tested at 100 U/ml of IL-2 and its expression correlates inversely with the IL-2 concentration. The p75 IL-2 receptor is expressed on about half of the cells at low density irrespective of the IL-2 concentration. NK-92 cells kill both K562 and Daudi cells very effectively in a 4 h51-chromium release assay (84 and 86% respectively, at an E:T cell ratio of 5:1).

In this report, we have evaluated the response of normal donor lymphocytes against allogeneic leukemic cells as an in vitro model of the GVL effect. We used a limiting dilution technique in order to determine the frequency of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte precursors (pre-CTL) against allogeneic leukemic blasts among normal donor lymphocytes. We demonstrate a considerable variability of CTL precursor frequency. This variability depended on leukemic populations since, for a given leukemia, the pre-CTL frequency was comparable among our tested normal allogeneic donors. Moreover, when HLA-DR negative leukemias were used as allostimulators, the pre-CTL frequencies were extremely low. In order to verify the impact of leukemic DR expression on the stimulatory capacity of leukemic cells, we selected and analyzed in mixed lymphocyte tumor cell culture (MLTC), a panel of myelogenous and lymphoblastic leukemias with variable levels of DR expression, each against different allogeneic responders. Our results demonstrated a close correlation (r = 0.953, p < 0.0001) between the proliferative response of alloactivated lymphocytes and the percentage of stimulatory leukemic cells expressing HLA-DR molecules. Anti-MHC class II monoclonal antibodies inhibited the lymphocyte proliferation in the MLTC, confirming the preponderant role of DR in the generation of this response. Overall, our results demonstrate the extreme variability of leukemic cells in their allostimulatory capacity and the central role of DR expression in determining leukemic allo-recognition. In the setting of a clinical protocol, our data suggest that the infusion of allogeneic T lymphocytes in a DR negative leukemia will not lead to an alloreactive T-cell anti-tumor effect.","['Delain, M', 'Tiberghien, P', 'Racadot, E', 'Billot, M', 'Pariset, J', 'Chabod, J', 'Cahn, J Y', 'Herve, P']","['Delain M', 'Tiberghien P', 'Racadot E', 'Billot M', 'Pariset J', 'Chabod J', 'Cahn JY', 'Herve P']","['Centre Regional de Transfusion Sanguine, Besancon, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['HLA-DR Antigens/immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*immunology/pathology', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*immunology/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Culture Test, Mixed', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*immunology/pathology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology/transplantation']",1994/04/01 00:00,1994/04/01 00:01,['1994/04/01 00:00'],"['1994/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1994 Apr;8(4):642-7.,['0 (HLA-DR Antigens)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unlike previous studies in factor-dependent cell lines, we found that expression of the functional abl protein tyrosine kinase did not lead to growth autonomy. Furthermore, the cells were still able to undergo terminal myeloid differentiation. However, expression of the functional gene did lead to a delay in maturation with a concomitant increase in cell production, had a modest effect in terms of delayed apoptosis particularly when the cells were maintained at a high cell density, and slightly increased the response to sub-optimal concentrations of IL-3.

We show that the c6.1B gene is transcribed in both of our patients. c6.1B may be important in the initial clonal proliferation of T lymphocytes which commonly precedes transformation to T-PLL in ataxia telangiectasia patients. The same gene may also be involved in the development of T-PLL in the non-A-T population.","['Thick, J', 'Mak, Y F', 'Metcalfe, J', 'Beatty, D', 'Taylor, A M']","['Thick J', 'Mak YF', 'Metcalfe J', 'Beatty D', 'Taylor AM']","['Department of Cancer Studies, University of Birmingham, UK.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Adult', 'Ataxia Telangiectasia/complications/*genetics', 'Base Sequence', '*Chromosomes', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement, alpha-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Prolymphocytic/complications/*genetics', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*genetics', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Transcription, Genetic', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1994/04/01 00:00,1994/04/01 00:01,['1994/04/01 00:00'],"['1994/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1994 Apr;8(4):564-73.,,,,,,"['c6.1A', 'c6.1B']",,"['GENBANK/S72931', 'GENBANK/S72942']",,,,,,,,,,,

In addition to seven cases with the molecular pattern usually associated with the t(1;19), we identified three molecular variants.

Five patients revealed a positive result. The specific PCR product differed in size from approximately 380-670 bp indicating various splicing variants in the MLL-1/AF4 rearrangement. Three patients had a fusion between exon 6 of the MLL-1 gene and codon 362 of the known AF4 cDNA sequence. Moreover, in two patients more than one specific PCR product was detected, possibly due to alternative splicing. In the first case, sequencing of these products revealed a hybrid mRNA consisting of MLI-1 exon 7 or exon 8, respectively, fused to the AF4 gene at codon 348. In the second case with alternative splicing, again, exon 7 or 8 of the MLL-1 gene were fused to the AF4 gene as in case 1. The AF4 sequence involved in this patient, however, started at codon 362. The AF4 break was, therefore, identical to the three MLL-1/AF4 positive patients as described above. Moreover, we investigated all ten patients for the reciprocal mRNA transcript AF4/MLL-1 by a similar PCR approach. In none of these patients, including the five MLL-1/AF4 positive cases was a specific PCR product obtained. However, in the MV411 cell line bearing a t(4;11), which served as a positive control in our MLL-1/AF4-PCR assay, the reciprocal AF4/MLL-1 mRNA was detected.

Mixed chimerism(MC) was detected in the haematopoietic cells of 3 patients. Two patients developed relapse of leukaemia after the detection of MC and one patient died of bone marrow hypoplasia 7 months after BMT. These findings indicate the clinical usefulness of this method to monitor patients with MC. Also, we analyzed cytokine gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells during the development of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in patients who underwent allo BMT using a semiquantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The expression of interleukin(IL)-1 beta, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha mRNA was increased during the development of GVHD and the degree of this increment depended on the severity of the disease. These findings suggest that IL-1 beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha produced by peripheral blood mononuclear cells play an important role in the development of GVHD. Therefore, analysis of MC and cytokine mRNA expression using the PCR technique after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation provide important information for treatment and monitoring of marrow transplant patients.","['Tanaka, J', 'Kasai, M', 'Imamura, M', 'Higa, T', 'Sakurada, K', 'Miyazaki, T']","['Tanaka J', 'Kasai M', 'Imamura M', 'Higa T', 'Sakurada K', 'Miyazaki T']","['3rd Department of Internal Medicine, Hokkaido University School of Medicine, Sapporo.']",['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Rinsho Byori,Rinsho byori.

C. Tupper, H. Chen, E. F. Hays, G. C. Bristol, and F. K. Yoshimura, J. Virol. 66:7080-7088, 1992). In this report, we have further explored the role of the DEN region in transcriptional activation. We observed that it has enhancer-like abilities as well as some unique LTR properties. Transcriptional activation by the DEN region involved interactions with enhancer sequences that were either synergistic or additive, depending on the cell type. The most intriguing property of the DEN region is its ability to induce transcription in activated T cells. This activity is unique for the LTR in that no other LTR region can do this. We also examined the role of the DEN region in retroviral lymphomagenesis. We cloned and sequenced proviral LTRs integrated upstream of the cellular c-myc gene from DNA obtained from thymic tumors induced by DEN region deletion mutant viruses in AKR mice. We determined that for transcriptional activation of the c-myc proto-oncogene, enhancer sequences can substitute for the DEN region.

The ecotropic construct CEET has the entire cytoplasmic tail of TM deleted, while the CEETR construct has only the R peptide portion of the tail deleted, thereby producing a TM subunit (p12E) that is identical to the one found in mature virions. The analogous amphotropic constructs were called CAET and CAETR. These envelopes, as opposed to their p15E TM counterparts, mediate cell-to-cell fusion at neutral pH in both transformed and nontransformed cell lines. Though the TM cytoplasmic domain is not required, its presence appears to augment such cell-to-cell fusion. This envelope-dependent fusion requires the presence of the viral receptor on the cell surface. Ecotropic virions bearing the p12E TM contain wild-type levels of the envelope complex and have near-normal titers. In contrast, virions which lack the cytoplasmic domain of TM (e.g., CEET) have 10- to 100-fold-lower titers but contain normal amounts of envelope. Both of the corresponding amphotropic virions contain normal amounts of envelope but have 10- to 100-fold-lower titers. Using immunofluorescent detection of envelope to monitor the fate of receptor-bound virions, we found that ecotropic murine leukemia virus envelope disappears from the cell surface while amphotropic envelope persists on the cell surface after virus binding. This pattern of immunofluorescence is consistent with the proposed routes of cell entry for these viruses, i.e., by endocytosis and direct fusion, respectively. In this assay, ecotropic virions bearing the genetically engineered p12E TM also appear to be internalized despite the ability of their envelope to mediate fusion at neutral pH in the same target cells. Our results show that direct fusion at neutral pH is a natural consequence of the surface expression of the mature ecotropic envelope and its receptor. We propose that the processing of the R peptide from the envelope TM (p15E) to yield p12E, at the time of virus budding or within virions, renders the envelope competent to fuse.","['Ragheb, J A', 'Anderson, W F']","['Ragheb JA', 'Anderson WF']","['Molecular Hematology Branch, National Heart Lung and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Biological Transport', 'CHO Cells', '*Cell Fusion', 'Cricetinae', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/classification/*physiology', 'Membrane Fusion', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Morphogenesis', 'Mutation', 'Peptide Fragments/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proviruses', 'Receptors, Virus/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/genetics/*physiology', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Viral Fusion Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Virion/growth & development']",1994/05/01 00:00,1994/05/01 00:01,['1994/05/01 00:00'],"['1994/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.68.5.3220-3231.1994 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1994 May;68(5):3220-31. doi: 10.1128/JVI.68.5.3220-3231.1994.,"['0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (Viral Fusion Proteins)', '0 (p15E protein, Murine leukemia virus)']",,,,,,,,PMC236813,,,,,,,,,,

Newborn rat pups received a unilateral sciatic nerve transection and the injury site was treated with gelfoam soaked in phosphate buffered saline (PBS), nerve growth factor (NGF), or LIF. Neuronal nucleoli in the L5 dorsal root ganglia were counted, appropriate corrections applied, and the resultant neuronal loss expressed as a percentage of the contralateral intact side. In animals where LIF was administered neuronal loss was significantly reduced: 2 days after LIF treatment neuronal loss was 19.5% compared to 43% in PBS-treated animals; 3 days after LIF treatment neuronal loss was 20.4% compared to 40.2% in PBS-treated animals; however, 7 days after LIF treatment there was no significant reduction in the number of neurons lost. The degree of rescue of sensory neurons in vivo by LIF was found to be similar to NGF, which was not surprising as both factors supported the survival of a similar population of sensory neurons in vitro. Rescue was not observed when LIF-containing gelfoam was placed away from the axotomised nerve, suggesting that LIF's action may be associated with its retrograde transport or direct signalling at the site of nerve injury.","['Cheema, S S', 'Richards, L', 'Murphy, M', 'Bartlett, P F']","['Cheema SS', 'Richards L', 'Murphy M', 'Bartlett PF']","['Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, Victoria, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Neurosci Res,Journal of neuroscience research,7600111,IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn/*physiology', 'Axons/*physiology', 'Cell Nucleolus/drug effects/ultrastructure', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Female', 'Ganglia, Spinal/*cytology/drug effects/ultrastructure', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'In Vitro Techniques', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*pharmacology', 'Male', 'Nerve Growth Factors/pharmacology', 'Neurons, Afferent/*drug effects/ultrastructure', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Sciatic Nerve/physiology/ultrastructure']",1994/02/01 00:00,1994/02/01 00:01,['1994/02/01 00:00'],"['1994/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jnr.490370207 [doi]'],ppublish,J Neurosci Res. 1994 Feb 1;37(2):213-8. doi: 10.1002/jnr.490370207.,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Nerve Growth Factors)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When the SV40 T O4-positive immortalised cell line isolated on the cell sorter was transplanted into demyelinated lesions in adult rats, cells were observed ensheathing axons and forming limited amounts of PNS-type myelin. Glial cells immortalised with a temperature-sensitive mutant of the SV40 T oncogene thus retain many physiological properties of their primary culture counterparts and can be induced to undergo limited differentiation in vitro and in vivo. These cell lines, which represent immature CNS glia or Schwann cells, are providing useful tools for investigating the role of cell surface antigens involved in neuron-glial interactions.","['Jung, M', 'Crang, A J', 'Blakemore, W F', 'Hoppe, D', 'Kettenmann, H', 'Trotter, J']","['Jung M', 'Crang AJ', 'Blakemore WF', 'Hoppe D', 'Kettenmann H', 'Trotter J']","['Department of Neurobiology, University of Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Neurosci Res,Journal of neuroscience research,7600111,IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Polyomavirus Transforming/*biosynthesis/immunology', 'Antigens, Surface/biosynthesis/immunology', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Bromodeoxyuridine/metabolism', 'Cell Transplantation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cerebellum/cytology', 'Clone Cells', 'DNA/biosynthesis', 'Electrophysiology', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Ganglia, Spinal/cytology/immunology', 'Mice', 'Neuroglia/immunology/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Retroviridae/genetics/*metabolism', 'Spinal Cord/cytology', 'Thymus Gland/cytology', 'Virus Replication']",1994/02/01 00:00,1994/02/01 00:01,['1994/02/01 00:00'],"['1994/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jnr.490370204 [doi]'],ppublish,J Neurosci Res. 1994 Feb 1;37(2):182-96. doi: 10.1002/jnr.490370204.,"['0 (Antigens, Polyomavirus Transforming)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'G34N38R2N1 (Bromodeoxyuridine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Seventy-six patients with follicular or transformed follicular lymphoma were treated with cyclophosphamide 60 mg/kg x 2 and total-body irradiation 12 Gy, supported by autologous bone marrow transplantation. The bone marrow mononuclear cell fraction was treated in vitro with CD20 monoclonal antibody and baby rabbit complement. The PCR technique was used to identify 50 patients with amplifiable t(14; 18) translocations in biopsy material from lymph nodes or bone marrow infiltrated by lymphoma. RESULTS: Following treatment of the harvested bone marrow in vitro, 29 samples were tested by PCR to assess the efficacy of purging. In 25 cases, the same t(14; 18) sequences were amplified as from the patients' original biopsies, while in four cases, the marrow became PCR-negative. Three of the four patients treated with PCR-negative marrow subsequently developed recurrent lymphoma, compared with 11 of 25 in the PCR-positive group. Bone marrow and peripheral-blood mononuclear cell samples from 27 patients were studied during the follow-up period. All but one had the presence of the lymphoma-related t(14; 18) clone detectable by PCR and confirmed by direct sequencing from at least one sample between 3 months and 7 years after reinfusion of the bone marrow. With a median follow-up duration of 3 years, 13 patients developed recurrent disease, 13 remained in remission with the t(14; 18) still detectable, and one died of acute myeloid leukemia. CONCLUSION: This form of therapy does not eliminate the lymphoma-related t(14; 18)-bearing clone of cells, although the significance of its continued presence is uncertain. Improved methods for both treatment of the bone marrow in vitro and treatment of the lymphoma in vivo are required.","['Johnson, P W', 'Price, C G', 'Smith, T', 'Cotter, F E', 'Meerabux, J', 'Rohatiner, A Z', 'Young, B D', 'Lister, T A']","['Johnson PW', 'Price CG', 'Smith T', 'Cotter FE', 'Meerabux J', 'Rohatiner AZ', 'Young BD', 'Lister TA']","[""Department of Medical Oncology, St Bartholomew's Hospital, London, United Kingdom.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Adult', 'Base Sequence', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 18', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cyclophosphamide/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/*genetics/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Survival Analysis', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Treatment Outcome']",1994/04/01 00:00,1994/04/01 00:01,['1994/04/01 00:00'],"['1994/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1994.12.4.798 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1994 Apr;12(4):798-805. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1994.12.4.798.,['8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)'],['J Clin Oncol. 1994 Nov;12(11):2516.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-two patients with advanced CLL received high-dose cyclophosphamide, total-body irradiation, and BMT. Eleven patients with relapsed CLL received autologous BMT with marrow collected during a prior fludarabine-induced remission; leukemia cells were depleted from the autologous marrow in seven patients using an anti-CD19 monoclonal antibody and immunomagnetic separation. Eleven patients received allogeneic or syngeneic BMT, seven of whom had refractory Rai stage III or IV disease. RESULTS: Six autologous transplant recipients achieved a complete remission (CR), four a nodular CR (nCR), and one a partial remission (PR). Two recurred with CLL, and three developed Richter's transformation. Two patients had recurrence of immune cytopenias while in morphologic remission; one of these patients died of cytomegalovirus pneumonia. Six of 11 patients survive in remission 2 to 29 months following BMT. Of the 11 patients who received allogeneic or syngeneic BMT, seven achieved a CR, two a nCR, and one a PR; 10 survive 2 to 36 months following BMT. CONCLUSION: These data indicate that high-dose chemotherapy with allogeneic BMT is effective at producing CRs in patients with CLL. Autologous transplantation in CLL is feasible and is capable of producing remissions in patients with advanced CLL.

Eleven infants had an EFS rate of 55% +/- 15% that might be attributable to treatment with high doses of methotrexate and cytarabine (ara-c). Twenty children with T-cell disease had an EFS rate of 70% +/- 10%. CNS leukemia relapse (isolated or combined with bone marrow) occurred in four of 82 SR patients who received 18 Gy of cranial irradiation and four of 138 HR and VHR patients who received 24 Gy.

To investigate the role of p106 further, its distribution and inducibility within hematopoietic cells was studied. Multiparameter flow cytometry (FCM) analysis showed that p106 expression was restricted to B cells and monocytes, and in both cell lineages acquired at a late stage of differentiation. Thus, p106 was found on mature B lymphocytes and monocytes in peripheral blood and on a variety of freshly isolated leukemic cells of B and myeloid origin as well as on a variety of cultured B-cell lines. In contrast, no expression was found on T lymphocytes, natural killer (NK) cells or granulocytes. p106 expression could be further induced by IFN-alpha on monocytes and Daudi cells, and this capacity was shown to be selective for IFN-alpha, since no other cytokines tested induced p106. Moreover, IFN-alpha therapy of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and hairy cell leukemia (HCL) patients lead to a clearcut induction of p106 on such malignant cells. The distribution of p106 could suggest that it represents an activation antigen. Further studies, including cloning of p106 cDNA, are needed to determine the function of p106.","['Tolstrup, A', 'Hokland, P', 'Nielsen, B', 'Justesen, J', 'Hokland, M']","['Tolstrup A', 'Hokland P', 'Nielsen B', 'Justesen J', 'Hokland M']","['Institute of Medical Microbiology, University of Aarhus, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Interferon Res,Journal of interferon research,8100396,IM,"['Cytokines/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'T-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/12/01 00:00,1993/12/01 00:01,['1993/12/01 00:00'],"['1993/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/jir.1993.13.433 [doi]'],ppublish,J Interferon Res. 1993 Dec;13(6):433-41. doi: 10.1089/jir.1993.13.433.,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report here that uPA produced by the human U937 promonocytic cell line also initiated the inactivation of recombinant interferon-gamma (rIFN-gamma) by plasmin-mediated proteolysis. When cultured serum-free with plasminogen, U937 promonocytic cells generated measurable levels of plasmin activity and destroyed the antiviral activity of exogenously added rIFN-gamma. This effect was not seen in the absence of plasminogen, was prevented by inhibitors of uPA and plasmin, and was accompanied by changes in the electrophoretic mobility of rIFN-gamma on polyacrylamide gels, consistent with limited proteolysis of the lymphokine. Culturing U937 cells or blood monocytes for 48 h led to an elevated expression of their surface uPA and an increase in their capacity to produce plasmin and inactivate rIFN-gamma. The ability of rIFN-gamma to induce Fc receptors on U937 cells could also be prevented by providing the cells with a source of exogenous plasminogen, indicating that U937 cells could control their own activation in vitro through the action of uPA. The results of these studies support the conclusion that mononuclear phagocytes have the capacity to use uPA to regulate cytokine activity in vitro.","['Parmely, M J', 'Sterner, K E', 'Gale, A', 'Zhou, W W']","['Parmely MJ', 'Sterner KE', 'Gale A', 'Zhou WW']","['Department of Microbiology, Molecular Genetics and Immunology, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City 66160-7420.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Interferon Res,Journal of interferon research,8100396,IM,"['Fibrinolysin/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Solubility', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Urokinase-Type Plasminogen Activator/*physiology']",1993/12/01 00:00,1993/12/01 00:01,['1993/12/01 00:00'],"['1993/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/jir.1993.13.397 [doi]'],ppublish,J Interferon Res. 1993 Dec;13(6):397-406. doi: 10.1089/jir.1993.13.397.,"['0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'EC 3.4.21.7 (Fibrinolysin)', 'EC 3.4.21.73 (Urokinase-Type Plasminogen Activator)']",,,,"['AI23337/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA54474/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'RR05373/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cytotoxic activity has been demonstrated in vitro against a variety of tumour cell lines, including a variant of the P388 leukaemia with acquired resistance to vincristine. A phase I clinical trial is planned and an assay suitable for preclinical and clinical pharmacokinetics has been developed. A high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) assay is described which allows measurement of 1069C85 in plasma, urine, and tissue samples. The method uses reversed-phase chromatography with isocratic elution and detection by fluorescence at 406 nm following excitation at 340 nm. The assay is specific, sensitive (limit of sensitivity 0.25 ng/ml) and reproducible (coefficient of variation < 5%). The method has been used to study the pharmacokinetics of 1069C85 in Balb C mice following a single oral dose of 1 mg/kg. The maximum plasma concentration was reached 15 min after administration and subsequent elimination was slow with a half life of 6.5 +/- 2.2 h. The drug remained detectable in plasma, at 1 +/- 0.5 ng/ml, 24 h after this dose. This assay will be used to determine the pharmacokinetic profile of 1069C85 in mice and in a forthcoming phase I clinical trial.","['Raynaud, F', 'Walton, M', 'Judson, I']","['Raynaud F', 'Walton M', 'Judson I']","['Drug Development Section, Institute of Cancer Research, Belmont, Sutton, Surrey, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,J Chromatogr,Journal of chromatography,0427043,IM,"['Animals', 'Biological Availability', 'Carbamates/*analysis/chemistry/pharmacokinetics', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Female', 'Half-Life', 'Humans', 'Intestinal Absorption', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Microtubules/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Pyridazines/*analysis/chemistry/pharmacokinetics', 'Solubility', 'Solvents', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence']",1993/12/22 00:00,1993/12/22 00:01,['1993/12/22 00:00'],"['1993/12/22 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/12/22 00:01 [medline]', '1993/12/22 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0378-4347(93)80272-6 [doi]'],ppublish,J Chromatogr. 1993 Dec 22;622(2):243-8. doi: 10.1016/0378-4347(93)80272-6.,"['0 (BW 1069C85)', '0 (Carbamates)', '0 (Pyridazines)', '0 (Solvents)']",,,,['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Both flow cytometry and confocal microscopy quantitative analysis did not reveal major differences in the fluorescence intensity of nuclei incubated at 37 degrees C in comparison with those maintained at 0 degrees C. Confocal scanning laser microscopy revealed that 6-iodoacetamidofluorescein labelled a fibrogranular network in isolated nuclei. The fluorescent pattern of the network was not affected by a 37 degrees C exposure of nuclei. However, such a network was not detectable in isolated nuclear matrices, thus suggesting a possible protein re-arrangement during matrix preparation.

We found no evidence of selection prior to malignant transformation as recombination was random with 1/3 ""in frame"" and 2/3 ""out of frame"" joinings and usage of all three D reading frames was observed. D and JH gene segments were predominantly unmutated which allowed a detailed analysis of gene usage and rearrangement characteristics. JH4 and JH6 usage (both 32.2%) was significantly different (p = 0.005) from that observed in peripheral B lymphocytes. D gene family usage roughly represented D gene family size with the exception of the DXP and DA/K family which were over- and underrepresented (p = < or = 0.05), respectively. D-D fusions were found in 26.2% of CDR3 regions. If less stringent criteria were applied DIR homology was found in 40/65 sequences, suggesting the frequent involvement of DIR gene segments in human CDR3 formation. The rearranged D genes were evenly distributed over the D locus, suggesting that D recombination is a predominantly random process, independent of physical location at the locus. Also, there was no correlation between JH gene usge and physical location of the rearranged D gene segment, which excludes a major contribution of the DJH replacement recombination mechanism. In 36.1% of CDR3 regions N-nucleotides at the DJH junction were absent. This frequency is higher than observed for peripheral B lymphocytes. It is suggested that for a number of ALL the initial transformational event took place in early fetal life. We conclude that ALL CDR3 sequences show no evidence of selection prior to malignant transformation, nor of extensive changes subsequent to malignant transformation.","['Steenbergen, E J', 'Verhagen, O J', 'van Leeuwen, E F', 'Behrendt, H', 'Merle, P A', 'Wester, M R', 'von dem Borne, A E', 'van der Schoot, C E']","['Steenbergen EJ', 'Verhagen OJ', 'van Leeuwen EF', 'Behrendt H', 'Merle PA', 'Wester MR', 'von dem Borne AE', 'van der Schoot CE']","['Central Laboratory, The Netherlands Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service, Amsterdam.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Base Sequence', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Child, Preschool', 'Fetus/*immunology', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Joining Region/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nucleotides/analysis', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*immunology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*immunology', '*Recombination, Genetic']",1994/04/01 00:00,1994/04/01 00:01,['1994/04/01 00:00'],"['1994/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/eji.1830240418 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 1994 Apr;24(4):900-8. doi: 10.1002/eji.1830240418.,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Joining Region)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Nucleotides)']",,,,,,,"['GENBANK/S69742', 'GENBANK/S69743', 'GENBANK/S69744', 'GENBANK/S69745', 'GENBANK/S69746']",,,,,,,,,,,

Since persistent antibodies to BLV proteins are a constant and early feature of BLV infection, a serological survey of cattle populations is the best method for detection of BLV infection.","['Kaura, H T', 'Hubschle, O J']","['Kaura HT', 'Hubschle OJ']","['Central Veterinary Laboratory, Windhoek, Namibia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Dtsch Tierarztl Wochenschr,DTW.

The parameters used to follow disease progression were: lymphopenia, circulating B and T8 cells, serum IgG and IgM levels, lymphoproliferation and skin graft rejection. Immunization with RNA-free viral pseudoparticles had no effect on any of these parameters. Preinfection of adults with ecotropic virus and the induction of tolerance in newborns to virus antigens both attenuated the early symptoms of viral infection and delayed the onset of immunodeficiency and lymphoproliferation in some mice, but did not significantly alter the number of deaths due to MAIDS. Failure of immune-based therapy to produce successful protection against MAIDS suggests that immune destruction caused by the persistent virus rather than hyperimmune activity is the main pathogenic factor in this disease.","['Pavlovitch, J H', 'Rizk-Rabin, M', 'Picard, F', 'Marussig, M', 'Halbreich, A']","['Pavlovitch JH', 'Rizk-Rabin M', 'Picard F', 'Marussig M', 'Halbreich A']","['CNRS URA 583, Hopital Necker, Paris, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Clin Exp Immunol,Clinical and experimental immunology,0057202,IM,"['Animals', 'CD4-CD8 Ratio', 'Female', 'Immune Tolerance', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*immunology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Murine Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/blood/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/immunology', 'Viral Vaccines/immunology']",1994/04/01 00:00,1994/04/01 00:01,['1994/04/01 00:00'],"['1994/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2249.1994.tb06231.x [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Exp Immunol. 1994 Apr;96(1):64-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2249.1994.tb06231.x.,['0 (Viral Vaccines)'],,,,,,,,PMC1534529,,,,,,,,,,

Using HPLC combined with electrochemical detection, we determined that 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8OHdG), a molecule typical of mutagenic oxidative DNA damage, was induced in the cellular DNA of a human promyelocytic leukemia cell line, HL60, incubated with crocidolite. Crocidolite increased 8OHdG in the cellular DNA of phorbol myristate acetate (PMA)-differentiated HL60, which phagocytosed crocidolite. PMA-differentiated HL60 released ROS spontaneously, as determined by ESR with 5,5-dimethylpyrrolone-N-oxide as a spin trap. However, the release of ROS from the cell line did not increase after the addition of crocidolite. The addition of superoxide dismutase at a sufficient concentration to scavenge ROS released from the cell did not inhibit the 8OHdG increase induced by crocidolite. Cytochalasin B, which inhibited phagocytosis, did not inhibit the release of ROS. However, it inhibited the crocidolite-induced 8OHdG increase by 48.3%. Contrary to PMA-differentiated HL60, undifferentiated HL60 neither phagocytosed crocidolite nor showed a crocidolite-induced increase in 8OHdG formation. The 8OHdG increase induced by crocidolite was not correlated with ROS release, but with the internalization of crocidolite, suggesting that the increase was not due to an increase in ROS release from the cell but was due to the conversion of relatively inert ROS to highly reactive ROS, such as hydroxyl radicals, by crocidolite that was internalized and close to DNA.","['Takeuchi, T', 'Morimoto, K']","['Takeuchi T', 'Morimoto K']","['Department of Hygiene and Preventive Medicine, Osaka University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Carcinogenesis,Carcinogenesis,8008055,IM,"[""8-Hydroxy-2'-Deoxyguanosine"", '*Asbestos, Crocidolite', 'Catalase/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cytochalasin B/pharmacology', '*DNA Damage', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*metabolism', 'Deoxyguanosine/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism/pathology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Superoxide Dismutase/pharmacology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/cytology']",1994/04/01 00:00,1994/04/01 00:01,['1994/04/01 00:00'],"['1994/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/carcin/15.4.635 [doi]'],ppublish,Carcinogenesis. 1994 Apr;15(4):635-9. doi: 10.1093/carcin/15.4.635.,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '12001-28-4 (Asbestos, Crocidolite)', '3CHI920QS7 (Cytochalasin B)', ""88847-89-6 (8-Hydroxy-2'-Deoxyguanosine)"", 'EC 1.11.1.6 (Catalase)', 'EC 1.15.1.1 (Superoxide Dismutase)', 'G9481N71RO (Deoxyguanosine)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The number of isolated microorganisms causing bacterial or fungal infections was also lower during acyclovir prophylaxis (52 isolates, versus 93 isolates; P = 0.02). There was no significant difference between the groups with regard to the number of clinically documented infections or fevers of unknown origin.

Water proton signal intensity correlated well with cellularity within bone marrow, as determined with parallel iliac crest biopsies. The fraction of signal from water in red bone marrow of patients with allogeneic transplants from siblings (four cases) was significantly higher than in four patients with autologous transplants. The latter showed very low cellularity in the period of about 4 weeks after BMT because of the cytotoxic pretreatment of the bone marrow.

These morphological changes, which occurred parallel with [Ca2+]i mobilization in the CMK11-5 cells, were similar to those observed in CMK cells in response to stimulation with ADP, thrombin, and collagen.

Two patients died, 12 and 8 years after diagnosis, the second one following transformation into myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia. The other two died of acute myelogenous leukemia, the first one, 25 years after diagnosis of CNL, following a 3-year phase of acceleration. The last patient presented combined features of CNL and refractory anemia with excess of blasts, and was characterized by both progressive leukocytosis and severe thrombocytopenia; acute transformation into acute myelogenous leukemia occurred 6 months after diagnosis and death 1 month later.

This selective effect of LIF on endothelial cells from different sources suggests that it may play a role in the failure of endothelial regrowth in atherosclerosis. Sections of human carotid endarterectomy samples were examined by in situ hybridization for LIF mRNA expression. In one-third of the samples (4/12) examined, cells within the atherosclerotic plaque exhibited LIF expression. Immunohistochemistry of serial sections suggested that the LIF-positive cells were activated macrophages.

Tunicamycin, an inhibitor of N-glycosylation, was used to investigate the roles of asparagine-linked oligosaccharides in the structure, intracellular routing, and transport function of GP-MTX. Tunicamycin was growth inhibitory toward CCRF-CEM cells (IC50-0.80 micrograms/mL) and caused a potent suppression of [3H]mannose incorporation into nascent glycoproteins. From 1-3 micrograms/mL, inhibition of [3H]mannose incorporation was 66-87%, exceeding that for [35S]methionine incorporation by 2 to 4-fold. Tunicamycin (1 and 2 micrograms/mL) exposures decreased the median molecular masses of GP-MTX on immunoblots (to 82 and 67 kDa, respectively) and were accompanied by reduced maximal rates of methotrexate uptake (31 and 37%, respectively, of control levels). Conversely, the Ki values for methotrexate binding to the transporter were unaffected by tunicamycin treatments. The effects of tunicamycin on methotrexate influx closely correlated with lower levels of immunoreactive GP-MTX in plasma membranes and specific [3H]methotrexate binding to intact cells, suggesting that the transport effect was due to decreased numbers of carrier proteins at the membrane surface. The reduced molecular mass values for GP-MTX, which accompanied tunicamycin exposures, were further decreased (to 55 and 50 kDa at 1 and 2 micrograms/mL, respectively) by digestions with N-glycanase. Hence, despite the large loss of N-glycan from GP-MTX in tunicamycin-treated cells, residual core oligosaccharides remained. The sizes of hypoglycosylated GP-MTX following both treatments were similar to that of the functionally homologous methotrexate membrane carrier previously identified in L1210 murine leukemia cells.","['Matherly, L H', 'Angeles, S M']","['Matherly LH', 'Angeles SM']","['Developmental Therapeutics Program, Michigan Cancer Foundation, Detroit 48201.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2', '*ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters', 'Biological Transport', 'Carrier Proteins/*metabolism', 'Glycosylation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*metabolism', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*metabolism', 'Methotrexate/*metabolism', '*Neoplasm Proteins', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/03/15 00:00,1994/03/15 00:01,['1994/03/15 00:00'],"['1994/03/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/03/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/03/15 00:00 [entrez]']","['0006-2952(94)90423-5 [pii]', '10.1016/0006-2952(94)90423-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1994 Mar 15;47(6):1094-8. doi: 10.1016/0006-2952(94)90423-5.,"['0 (ABCG2 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2)', '0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",,,,['CA-53535/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Signals through CD28 can costimulate T cells in the presence of limiting amounts of T cell receptor signal, or in the presence of PMA, providing this second signal. CD28 signaling is known to involve the activation of protein tyrosine kinases. Using the Jurkat leukemic cell line as a model, we have tested CD28 crosslinking for its effects on the protein tyrosine kinases p56lck. We report that following crosslinking of CD28, p56lck kinase activity is increased. Crosslinking CD28 causes a shift in the relative mobility of p56lck from 56 to 60 kD similar to that seen after crosslinking of CD2 and CD4, cell surface receptors known to be associate with and activate p56lck. Finally, lck could be found in anti-CD28 immunoprecipitates in exponentially growing Jurkat and in ""activated"" CD28 (i.e., cross linked), but not in CD28 in resting Jurkat cells.

The present study reviews biopsy specimens from patients examined during a two year period which were sent for flow cytometry with a diagnosis of suspected lymphoma. Sixteen of 25 samples (64 percent) produced cell suspensions of sufficient quantity and quality to be diagnostically helpful. Results showed that in 9/16 (56 percent) the diagnosis of lymphoma or cancer could be suspected by flow cytometry alone, while 4/16 were consistent with the final tissue diagnosis of normal or reactive hyperplasia. Three samples that came from patients who had morphologic evidence of malignant disease on biopsy (two Hodgkin's disease and one large cell lymphoma) had flow cytometry results that were interpreted as normal. Flow cytometry is rapid and appears to be virtually diagnostic of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma when a majority of cells are B cells with an abnormal kappa/lambda ratio (> 4.0 or < 0.25). Nonhematologic malignancy can be suspected if less than 75 percent of the cells show CD45 (common leukocyte antigen). Hodgkin's disease cannot be detected by flow cytometry as it is currently used, and as many as 15 percent (1/6 in this study) of lymphomas may show normal results. It is extremely helpful when the biopsy sample actually contains the cells of interest in large proportion. Loss of architectural relationships in the course of processing specimens for flow cytometry is a major disadvantage when small foci of lymphoma or tumor cells exist together with large amounts of stroma or normal lymphocytes.","['Morse, E E', 'Yamase, H T', 'Greenberg, B R', 'Sporn, J', 'Harshaw, S A', 'Kiraly, T R', 'Ziemba, R A', 'Fallon, M A']","['Morse EE', 'Yamase HT', 'Greenberg BR', 'Sporn J', 'Harshaw SA', 'Kiraly TR', 'Ziemba RA', 'Fallon MA']","['University of Connecticut Health Center, Farmington 06030.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Ann Clin Lab Sci,Annals of clinical and laboratory science,0410247,IM,"['Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology/pathology', '*Flow Cytometry', 'Hodgkin Disease/diagnosis', 'Humans', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Lymph Nodes/immunology', 'Lymphoma/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/diagnosis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/pathology']",1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Ann Clin Lab Sci. 1994 Jan-Feb;24(1):6-11.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The administration of 100 micrograms of MDP-Lys(L18) 2 or 4 days before tumour inoculation led to a significant decrease in lung metastasis of B16-BL6 melanoma or colon 26-M3.1 carcinoma cells. MDP-Lys(L18) was also effective in the inhibition of liver metastasis of L5178Y-ML25 lymphoma cells by administration 2 or 4 days before tumour inoculation. The prophylactic effect of 100 micrograms of MDP-Lys(L18) on tumour metastasis was evident for the different administration routes, i.e. subcutaneous, intravenous or intranasal injection, or oral administration. It is of prime interest that oral administration of 1 mg of MDP-Lys(L18) induced a significant decrease in lung metastasis of B16-BL6 melanoma cells. Administration of MDP-Lys(L18) 4 days before assay led to induction of tumoricidal activity by peritoneal macrophages and growth inhibition by the sera against B16-BL6 or L929 cells. When MDP-Lys(L18) was subcutaneously administered five times after tumour inoculation to test therapeutic effect in an experimental and spontaneous metastasis model using B16-BL6 melanoma, the consecutive administrations of MDP-Lys(L18) significantly inhibited lung metastasis in tumour-bearing mice. These results suggest that MDP-Lys(L18) is able to enhance host resistance to reduce tumour metastasis and is a potent immunomodulating agent which may be applied prophylactically or therapeutically for the treatment of cancer metastasis.","['Yoo, Y C', 'Saiki, I', 'Sato, K', 'Azuma, I']","['Yoo YC', 'Saiki I', 'Sato K', 'Azuma I']","['Institute of Immunological Science, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Vaccine,Vaccine,8406899,IM,"['Acetylmuramyl-Alanyl-Isoglutamine/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Adjuvants, Immunologic/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Female', 'Immunotherapy', 'Leukemia L5178/immunology/therapy', 'Liver Neoplasms, Experimental/prevention & control/secondary', 'Lung Neoplasms/prevention & control/secondary', 'Macrophage Activation', 'Macrophages, Peritoneal/immunology', 'Melanoma, Experimental/immunology/secondary/therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/immunology/secondary/*therapy', 'Neoplastic Cells, Circulating', 'Splenic Neoplasms/prevention & control/secondary']",1994/02/01 00:00,1994/02/01 00:01,['1994/02/01 00:00'],"['1994/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0264-410X(94)90057-4 [pii]', '10.1016/0264-410x(94)90057-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Vaccine. 1994 Feb;12(2):175-60. doi: 10.1016/0264-410x(94)90057-4.,"['0 (Adjuvants, Immunologic)', '53678-77-6 (Acetylmuramyl-Alanyl-Isoglutamine)', 'SUP956TPT6 (romurtide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In particular, in hemolymphoproliferative disorders, diagnostic imaging is used to differentiate the complications of integrated treatment from possible relapses. Integrated treatments have lengthened the survival of these patients and therefore such long-term complications as secondary--especially solid--tumors are now more frequently observed. We report on two such cases whose onset followed by 6 and 5 1/2 years the end of the initial treatment: the patients had been cured for acute lymphatic leukemia and Hodgkin's lymphoma. In the leukemia patient, CT and MRI demonstrated a large mediastinal mass, which had been an occasional finding at chest film. CT correctly diagnosed the mass and suggested extrapulmonary and extramediastinal localization, since fat cleavages were normal. MRI allowed better characterization of the mass which was isointense to muscle independent of TR. Disease relapse was excluded and surgery allowed the complete ablation of the ganglioneuroma. In the lymphoma patient, a left hypochondrium mass was supposed as an abdominal relapse from Hodgkin's lymphoma. CT allowed the correct diagnosis of gastric adenocarcinoma to be made on the basis of the mass multifocality and marked enhancement, of the infiltration of liver and hepatogastric ligament lymph nodes and finally of peritoneal involvement. Secondary solid tumors are no remote finding in the follow-up of the patients treated for lymphoproliferative disorders. Diagnostic imaging must allow the differential diagnosis especially from relapses and must use the techniques which are most capable of doing so.","['La Fianza, A', 'Dore, R', 'Torretta, L', 'Arico, M', 'Campani, R']","['La Fianza A', 'Dore R', 'Torretta L', 'Arico M', 'Campani R']","['Istituto di Radiologia, Universita di Pavia.']",['ita'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Italy,Radiol Med,La Radiologia medica,0177625,IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/*diagnostic imaging', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Female', 'Ganglioneuroma/*diagnostic imaging', '*Hodgkin Disease/therapy', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*diagnostic imaging', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/therapy', 'Stomach Neoplasms/*diagnostic imaging', 'Thoracic Neoplasms/*diagnostic imaging', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed']",1994/03/01 00:00,1994/03/01 00:01,['1994/03/01 00:00'],"['1994/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Radiol Med. 1994 Mar;87(3):289-94.,,,,,,,Seconde neoplasie solide nei giovani pazienti trattati per malattie linfoproliferative: quadri con tomografia computerizzata.,,,,,,,,,,,,

The alpha subunit by itself binds ligand at low affinity, whereas the isolated beta subunit does not bind GM-CSF. It is generally believed that the high-affinity receptor is responsible for the multiple functions of GM-CSF and that the isolated alpha subunit (GMR alpha) does not transduce a signal. Xenopus laevis oocytes injected with RNA encoding human GMR alpha expressed up to 10(10) low-affinity sites for GM-CSF (Kd = 6 nM). GM-CSF binding to the alpha subunit expressed in Xenopus oocytes caused activation of 2-deoxyglucose transport through endogenous glucose transporters. 2-Deoxyglucose transport was stimulated by similar low concentrations of GM-CSF in HL-60 leukemia cells as well as normal human neutrophils and Xenopus oocytes expressing GMR alpha. Engagement of the isolated alpha subunit in oocytes did not lead to protein phosphorylation or tyrosine phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase). Staurosporin and genistein inhibited GM-CSF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of MAP kinase in human neutrophils and HL-60 cells without affecting GM-CSF-stimulated uptake of 2-deoxyglucose. These results provide direct evidence that the isolated alpha subunit signals for hexose transport and can do so without engagement of the kinase cascade. Our data also indicate that signaling for hexose uptake may occur in a phosphorylation-independent manner in cells expressing the high-affinity GM-CSF receptor.","['Ding, D X', 'Rivas, C I', 'Heaney, M L', 'Raines, M A', 'Vera, J C', 'Golde, D W']","['Ding DX', 'Rivas CI', 'Heaney ML', 'Raines MA', 'Vera JC', 'Golde DW']","['Sloan-Kettering Institute Graduate Program of Molecular Biology, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10021.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Alkaloids/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Biological Transport', 'Deoxyglucose/*metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Genistein', 'Glucose Transporter Type 4', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Isoflavones/pharmacology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1', 'Monosaccharide Transport Proteins/genetics/metabolism', '*Muscle Proteins', 'Neutrophils/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein Conformation', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/drug effects/metabolism', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/drug effects/metabolism', 'Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'Staurosporine', 'Xenopus laevis']",1994/03/29 00:00,1994/03/29 00:01,['1994/03/29 00:00'],"['1994/03/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/03/29 00:01 [medline]', '1994/03/29 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.91.7.2537 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1994 Mar 29;91(7):2537-41. doi: 10.1073/pnas.91.7.2537.,"['0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (Glucose Transporter Type 4)', '0 (Isoflavones)', '0 (Monosaccharide Transport Proteins)', '0 (Muscle Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (SLC2A4 protein, human)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '9G2MP84A8W (Deoxyglucose)', 'DH2M523P0H (Genistein)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)']",,,,"['CA08748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA30388/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL42107/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,PMC43404,,,,,,,,,,

In the regenerating rat sciatic nerve, Schwann cells provide a trophic milieu for primary sensory, sympathetic, and motoneurons. We have characterized a neurotrophic activity produced by adult rat sciatic nerve Schwann cells and a spontaneously immortal Schwann cell clone (iSC). This activity elicits neurite outgrowth from chick embryo explants of both CNS and PNS. The iSC activity has been concentrated by cation-exchange chromatography and compared to known neurotrophins in bioassay. Pooled bound fractions elicit neurite outgrowth from sympathetic, ciliary and motoneurons. In collagen matrix cocultures of iSC and E4 ventral horn (before motor axon extension to muscle targets), the iSC activity can direct the initial axonal extension from motoneurons.

Among these 2',3'-dideoxy-L-nucleoside analogues, 2',3'-dideoxy-beta-L-5-fluorocytidine (6, beta-L-FddC) was found to be the most active against HIV-1, which is approximately 3 and 4 times more active against HIV-1 in vitro than 2',3'-dideoxy-beta-D-cytidine (ddC) and 2',3'-dideoxy-beta-D-5-fluorocytidine (beta-D-FddC) with ED50 values of 0.5, 1.5, and 2 microM, respectively. The dose-limiting toxicity of ddC is severe neuropathy which may be caused by the inhibition of the synthesis of mitochondrial DNA. ddC has an IC50 value of 0.022 microM against host mitochondrial DNA synthesis. Conversely, the IC50 values for beta-L-FddC and beta-L-ddC are > 100 microM; therefore, neuropathy may not present itself to be a problem with beta-L-FddC and beta-L-ddC as chemotherapeutic agents. In addition, beta-L-FddC and 2',3'-dideoxy-beta-L-cytidine (8, beta-L-ddC) demonstrated equally potent activity against HBV in vitro by having the same ED50 value of 0.01 microM. Both beta-L-FddC and beta-L-ddC, which have an ""unnatural"" L-configuration in the sugar moiety, are approximately 1000 and 280 times more potent, respectively, against HBV than the D-configuration beta-D-FddC and ddC which have an ED50 values of 10 and 2.8 microM. In view of the potent antiviral activity of beta-L-FddC against both HIV-1 and HBV and potent antiviral activity of beta-L-ddC against HBV in vitro, their low cytotoxicity, and especially the negligible inhibitory effect on host mitochondrial DNA synthesis, beta-L-FddC and beta-L-ddC merit further development as potential anti-HIV and anti-HBV agents.","['Lin, T S', 'Luo, M Z', 'Liu, M C', 'Pai, S B', 'Dutschman, G E', 'Cheng, Y C']","['Lin TS', 'Luo MZ', 'Liu MC', 'Pai SB', 'Dutschman GE', 'Cheng YC']","['Department of Pharmacology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut 06510.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,IM,"['Animals', 'Antiviral Agents/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'DNA, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'HIV-1/*drug effects', 'Hepatitis B virus/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Microbial Sensitivity Tests', 'Pyrimidine Nucleosides/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Stereoisomerism', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Zalcitabine/*analogs & derivatives/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology']",1994/03/18 00:00,1994/03/18 00:01,['1994/03/18 00:00'],"['1994/03/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/03/18 00:01 [medline]', '1994/03/18 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/jm00032a013 [doi]'],ppublish,J Med Chem. 1994 Mar 18;37(6):798-803. doi: 10.1021/jm00032a013.,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (DNA, Mitochondrial)', '0 (Pyrimidine Nucleosides)', ""147058-39-7 (2',3'-dideoxy-beta-5-fluorocytidine)"", '6L3XT8CB3I (Zalcitabine)']",,,,"['AI-29430/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-44358/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In particular, human myeloma cell lines (HMCL), whose growth is completely dependent on addition of exogenous IL-6, can be obtained reproducibly from every patient with terminal disease. Four cytokines, ciliary neurotropic factor (CNTF), IL-11, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), and oncostatin M (OM), use the same transducer chain (signal transducer gp130) as IL-6 and share numerous biological activities with this IL. We found that these four cytokines stimulated proliferation and supported the long-term growth of two out of four IL-6-dependent HMCL obtained in our laboratory. Half-maximal proliferation was obtained with cytokine concentrations ranging from 0.4 to 1.2 ng/ml for IL-11, LIF, and OM. CNTF worked at high concentrations only (90 ng/ml), but addition of soluble CNTF receptor increased sensitivity to CNTF 30-fold.

The etiologic virus in this mixture is replication defective (BM5def) and encodes only a variant gag protein. Genetic determinants of resistance and susceptibility to induction of MAIDS reside both within and outside the MHC. In strains with C57BL background genes, the MHC haplotypes associated with resistance to disease include d and a, whereas haplotypes b, s, and q are associated with sensitivity. Previous studies showed that MHC class I genes (H-2Dd, H-2Ld) mapping in the D end of H-2 and other genes mapping proximal to the D end determine resistance to MAIDS. This paper examines the nature of these non-D end MHC genes using assays of MHC recombinant and transgenic mice. We demonstrate that expression of E alpha d confers significant resistance to MAIDS, even in mice that do not express H-2Dd/H-2Ld. Unexpectedly, we found that E alpha polymorphisms can significantly influence resistance, with H-2b mice bearing E alpha d as a transgene having greater resistance to MAIDS than mice bearing an E alpha k transgene. E alpha d-mediated resistance to MAIDS was associated with decreased levels of the BM5def genome in splenic DNA, suggesting that E alpha genes exert their effect by enhancing antiviral activity.","['Makino, M', 'Tang, Y', 'Murphy, D B', 'Fredrickson, T N', 'Okada, Y', 'Fujiwara, M', 'Chattopadhyay, S K', 'Mizuochi, T', 'Komuro, K', 'Morse, H C 3rd']","['Makino M', 'Tang Y', 'Murphy DB', 'Fredrickson TN', 'Okada Y', 'Fujiwara M', 'Chattopadhyay SK', 'Mizuochi T', 'Komuro K', 'Morse HC 3rd', 'et al.']","['Laboratory of Immunopathology, National Institute of Allergy and infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Viral/immunology', 'H-2 Antigens/*immunology', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/*immunology', 'Immunity, Innate', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic/immunology', 'Murine Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/genetics/*immunology', 'Superantigens/immunology']",1994/04/15 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1994/04/15 00:00'],"['1994/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1994/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1994 Apr 15;152(8):4157-64.,"['0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (H-2 Antigens)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)', '0 (I-E-antigen)', '0 (Superantigens)']",,,,"['AI-14349-14/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'N0-AI-72622/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

TNF exhibits a wide variety of biologic actions, but which receptor is responsible for these biologic actions is not well characterized. In the present study, we examined the roles of the p60 and p80 receptors in three different TNF-induced biologic actions: 1) cytotoxicity; 2) DNA fragmentation; and 3) differentiation to macrophages. Analysis of TNF actions on various tumor cell lines revealed that TNF-induced cytotoxicity occurred in cells that expressed the p60 receptor, irrespective of expression of the p80 receptor. In contrast, DNA fragmentation and differentiation were observed only in cells that expressed both receptor types. Additionally, the specific Ab to each receptor were used to examine the roles of both receptors in the myelogenous leukemia cell line, ML-1a. Anti-p60 Ab alone showed cytotoxicity but little DNA fragmentation and differentiation, and anti-p80 Ab alone showed no effects. When these Abs were added in the presence of TNF, each independently, and almost completely, inhibited TNF-induced DNA fragmentation and differentiation. We also found that both Abs together synergistically induce differentiation and DNA fragmentation. These results indicate that signals through the p60 receptor are essential to induce cytotoxicity, but signals through both the p60 and p80 receptors are necessary, and act synergistically, for DNA fragmentation and differentiation.","['Higuchi, M', 'Aggarwal, B B']","['Higuchi M', 'Aggarwal BB']","['Department of Clinical Immunology and Biological Therapy, University of Texas M.

The RAW 264 cells exported putrescine constitutively at a significant rate into the culture medium. This export process appeared to be selective for putrescine in that only a small amount of other polyamines (spermidine and N1-acetylspermidine) was found in the culture medium. LPS and IFN-gamma alone and in combination markedly stimulated putrescine export and nitrite production throughout a 24-h period. The efflux of putrescine but not nitrite was further increased by the addition of ornithine (the amino acid precursor of putrescine) to the culture medium. LPS and ornithine also stimulated the intracellular accumulation of putrescine in primary inflammatory macrophages and the export of putrescine into the peritoneal exudate of the mouse. A detailed comparison of the steady state rates of accumulation of intracellular putrescine/polyamines and the rate of putrescine efflux from the cells constitutively and after LPS, IFN-gamma, and ornithine indicated that a surprisingly large fraction of total polyamine biosynthesis is comprised of exported putrescine. The observed dose-dependent inhibition of putrescine export with the drug verapamil implicated the involvement of a specific membrane transport system sensitive to calcium influx in this process. The data are discussed in regard to the potential involvement of putrescine export in the regulation of intracellular polyamine levels, cell differentiation, and macrophage-mediated cytotoxicity.","['Tjandrawinata, R R', 'Hawel, L 3rd', 'Byus, C V']","['Tjandrawinata RR', 'Hawel L 3rd', 'Byus CV']","['Department of Biochemistry, University of California, Riverside 92521.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['8-Bromo Cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'DNA/biosynthesis', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Eflornithine/pharmacology', 'Inflammation/metabolism', 'Interferon-gamma/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/metabolism', 'Lipopolysaccharides/*pharmacology', 'Macrophages/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Ornithine/pharmacology', 'Ornithine Decarboxylase/metabolism', 'Putrescine/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Verapamil/pharmacology']",1994/03/15 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1994/03/15 00:00'],"['1994/03/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1994/03/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1994 Mar 15;152(6):3039-52.,"['0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '23583-48-4 (8-Bromo Cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)', 'E524N2IXA3 (Ornithine)', 'EC 4.1.1.17 (Ornithine Decarboxylase)', 'V10TVZ52E4 (Putrescine)', 'ZQN1G5V6SR (Eflornithine)']",,,,['ES06128/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The chromosome 22 translocation breakpoints are concentrated within a 5.8-kilobase region named the major break-point cluster region (Mbcr). Gel mobility shift and DNase I footprinting assays have defined binding sites for three proteins, BIF 1-3 (BCR intron factors 1-3), lying within a 427-base pair fragment of the Mbcr. This 427-base pair fragment functions as a transcriptional silencer with both the BCR as well as a heterologous promoter. The silencing is position- and orientation-independent. The transcriptional effects are greatest in chronic myelogenous leukemia cells, decreased in HeLa and B-cells, and absent in T-lymphocytes.

These enhancers are known to be required for transcriptional induction of these genes by interferon-gamma. Assembly of the DNA-binding protein complexes occurs within minutes after ligand addition and depends upon tyrosine phosphorylation. These complexes contain the p91 transcription factor, which is tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to these cytokines. An additional tyrosine-phosphorylated protein of 93 kDa can be coimmunoprecipitated with antibodies against p91. These findings further expand the network of cytokines known to activate p91 and, in addition, support the concept that sets of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins may be responsible for the cytokine-regulated expression of early response genes.","['Feldman, G M', 'Petricoin, E F 3rd', 'David, M', 'Larner, A C', 'Finbloom, D S']","['Feldman GM', 'Petricoin EF 3rd', 'David M', 'Larner AC', 'Finbloom DS']","['Division of Cytokine Biology, Food and Drug Administration, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Animals', '*Antigens, CD', 'Base Sequence', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130', 'Cytokines/*metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Interferon Regulatory Factor-1', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides', 'Phosphoproteins/genetics', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Binding', 'Receptors, Fc/genetics', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor', 'Signal Transduction', '*Trans-Activators', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tyrosine/*metabolism']",1994/04/08 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1994/04/08 00:00'],"['1994/04/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1994/04/08 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(17)34122-4 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1994 Apr 8;269(14):10747-52.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Il6st protein, mouse)', '0 (Interferon Regulatory Factor-1)', '0 (Irf1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)', '0 (STAT1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cell cycle regulated phosphorylation by p34cdc2 kinase.,10312-8,"p18 is a phosphoprotein that is expressed at very high levels in leukemic cells, at moderately high levels in proliferating normal lymphocytes, and at low levels in quiescent lymphocytes. Induction of terminal differentiation of leukemic cells in culture results in a decrease in cellular proliferation. These phenotypic changes are associated with rapid phosphorylation of p18, followed by a more gradual decrease in the level of its mRNA expression. More than 12 different phosphorylation products of p18 have been identified in different cells by high resolution two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Previous studies have suggested that p18 may be a substrate for protein kinase C in some cellular processes and protein kinase A in others. In this report, we show that the phosphorylation of p18 increases as cells progress toward the G2-M phases of the cell cycle in proliferating leukemic cells. We have examined the hypothesis that the putative role of p18 in cellular proliferation may be mediated by its involvement in the p34cdc2 kinase signal transduction pathway. We have produced recombinant p18 in bacterial cells and shown that it can be phosphorylated in vitro by purified p34cdc2 kinase with a stoichiometry of 0.86 mol of PO4/mol of substrate. We have used site-directed mutagenesis to demonstrate that the site of p34cdc2 phosphorylation is the serine at position 38. This same site has previously been shown to be phosphorylated in vivo in bovine brain along with another serine at position 25. The observation that p18 gets phosphorylated in the G2-M phases of the cell cycle and the demonstration that p18 is phosphorylated efficiently by p34cdc2 kinase in vitro at a residue that is also phosphorylated in vivo support the hypothesis that p18 may be a physiologic substrate for p34cdc2 kinase in vivo. We have also examined the effect of inhibiting the expression of p18 on cell cycle progression. These experiments demonstrated that antisense inhibition of the expression of p18 in K562 erythroleukemia cells is associated with a decrease in cellular proliferation and accumulation of cells in the G2-M phases of the cycle. The implications of these findings to the proposed role of p18 in the regulation of cellular proliferation are discussed.","['Luo, X N', 'Mookerjee, B', 'Ferrari, A', 'Mistry, S', 'Atweh, G F']","['Luo XN', 'Mookerjee B', 'Ferrari A', 'Mistry S', 'Atweh GF']","['Department of Medicine, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, New York 10029.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Base Sequence', 'CDC2 Protein Kinase/*metabolism', '*Cell Cycle', 'DNA Primers', 'Glutathione Transferase/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', '*Microtubule Proteins', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phosphoproteins/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stathmin', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/04/08 00:00,1994/04/08 00:01,['1994/04/08 00:00'],"['1994/04/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/04/08 00:01 [medline]', '1994/04/08 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(17)34062-0 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1994 Apr 8;269(14):10312-8.,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Microtubule Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (STMN1 protein, human)', '0 (Stathmin)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDC2 Protein Kinase)']",,,,['HL42919/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Addition of physiologic amounts of AG to the extracellular medium resulted in rapid intracellular incorporation of AG, with a half-saturation time of 5 s. Intracellular accumulation was linear for 2 h and subsequently reached saturation. AG uptake was temperature and concentration dependent with an apparent Km of 127 mM. AG uptake and accumulation was not inhibited by fructose, fucose, galactose, mannose, glucose, or 3-O-methyl-D-glucose and was less affected by cytochalasin B or phloretin than that of 2-deoxyglucose. Phloridzin did not affect AG uptake but did inhibit 2-deoxyglucose uptake. Efflux of AG from K-562 cells depended on external AG concentration alone and was not affected by extracellular glucose concentration. Intracellular AG concentration decreased rapidly and reached zero within 10 min following removal of AG from the external medium.

In either human K-562 or mouse L-929 cells these effects were observed without a detectable increase in the binding for any of the subtypes of IFN alpha tested. We propose that the cloned IFN alpha R subunit functions as a transducer subunit for the IFN alpha R.

Flow cytometry was performed using monoclonal antibody against DNA polymerase alpha. Since fresh and frozen cells showed virtually identical DNA polymerase alpha-positive populations and flow cytometric histograms, 52 cryopreserved samples (25 from peripheral blood and 27 from bone marrow) were used in this study. The DNA polymerase alpha-positive population ranged from 20.4% to 84.7% in peripheral blood, and from 6.5% to 92.1% in bone marrow. A positive correlation (r = 0.76, P < 0.01) was found between DNA polymerase alpha-positive populations in peripheral blood and bone marrow from the same patient. This suggests that the DNA polymerase alpha-positive population in the bone marrow can be estimated from that in peripheral blood. No relationship was observed between the positive population and the response to chemotherapy. Statistical analyses for all cases showed no relationship between the DNA polymerase alpha-positive population and either the tumor cell count or time to reach a nadir. However, a negative correlation was observed between the positive population in bone marrow samples and the time to reach a nadir (r = -0.64, P < 0.05) in those patients who achieved a complete response. In addition, in the cases of acute non-lymphocytic leukemia who did not respond to chemotherapy, a positive correlation was observed between the tumor cell count in bone marrow and the DNA polymerase alpha-positive population (r = 0.93, P < 0.01).

The 'DEAD/H' family of putative RNA helicases may help regulate these processes by utilizing intrinsic RNA-dependent ATPase activity to catalyze conformational changes in RNA secondary structure. To investigate the repertoire of DEAD/H box proteins expressed in mammals, we used PCR techniques to clone from mouse erythroleukemia (MEL) cells three new DEAD box cDNAs with high similarity to known yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) genes. mDEAD2 and mDEAD3 (mouse DEAD box proteins) are > 95% identical to mouse PL10 but exhibit differential tissue-specific expression patterns; mDEAD2 and mDEAD3 are also approx. 70% identical (at the aa level) to yeast DED1 and DBP1 proteins. Members of this DEAD box subclass contain C-terminal domains with high content of Arg, Ser, Gly and Phe, reminiscent of the RS domain in several Drosophila and mammalian splicing factors. mDEAD5 belongs to a second class related to translation initiation factors from yeast (TIF1/TIF2) and mammals (eIF-4A); this class contains a novel conserved peptide motif not found in other DEAD box proteins. Northern blotting shows that mDEAD5 is differentially expressed in testis vs. somatic tissues. Thus, mouse erythroid cells produce two highly conserved families of putative RNA helicases likely to play important roles in RNA metabolism and gene expression.","['Gee, S L', 'Conboy, J G']","['Gee SL', 'Conboy JG']","['Life Sciences Division, Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, University of California, Berkeley 94720.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Gene,Gene,7706761,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Northern', '*Conserved Sequence', 'DNA', 'Erythroblasts/*enzymology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Mammals/genetics', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Organ Specificity/genetics', 'Phylogeny', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA Helicases', 'RNA Nucleotidyltransferases/chemistry/*genetics', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae/*genetics', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/03/25 00:00,1994/03/25 00:01,['1994/03/25 00:00'],"['1994/03/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/03/25 00:01 [medline]', '1994/03/25 00:00 [entrez]']","['0378-1119(94)90541-X [pii]', '10.1016/0378-1119(94)90541-x [doi]']",ppublish,Gene. 1994 Mar 25;140(2):171-7. doi: 10.1016/0378-1119(94)90541-x.,"['9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (RNA Nucleotidyltransferases)', 'EC 3.6.4.13 (RNA Helicases)']",,,,['HL 45182/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],['DEAD box'],,"['GENBANK/L25125', 'GENBANK/L25126', 'GENBANK/L25337']",,,,,,,,,,,

We have shown earlier that CLL cells spontaneously proliferate in serum-free medium in the absence of added growth factors and mitogenic stimulation; autocrine growth factors provide the growth-initiating signal for CLL cells. The results of the present study showed that bovine serum albumin or fetal calf serum greatly enhanced the number of CLL cells incorporating [3H]thymidine. Although some CLL cells proceeded through more than one cell cycle, proliferation of CLL cells in culture was temporary. On the other hand, it was shown that CLL cells differentiated spontaneously in culture. This differentiation was characterized by the appearance of plasmacytoid cells possessing cytoplasmic immunoglobulins that coincided with the cessation of cell proliferation. Moreover, together with spontaneous proliferation and differentiation, the phenomenon of programmed cell death (apoptosis) was found, as was evidenced by the appearance of apoptotic bodies as well as DNA fragmentation. The findings indicate that the loss of proliferative potential of CLL cells in culture may be a consequence of their differentiation and/or apoptosis in vitro. CLL cells, with an autocrine growth mechanism, spontaneous differentiation, and apoptosis in vitro, provide a new model system for studies of the relationship between cellular proto-oncogene expression and inhibition of growth and/or induction of differentiation.","['Kalvelyte, A', 'Pabrezaite, L']","['Kalvelyte A', 'Pabrezaite L']","['Laboratory of Developmental Biology, Institute of Biochemistry, Vilnius, Lithuania.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Cattle', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'DNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/metabolism/*pathology', 'Lymphocytes/metabolism/pathology', 'Plasma Cells/pathology', 'Thymidine/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/metabolism/pathology']",1994/04/01 00:00,1994/04/01 00:01,['1994/04/01 00:00'],"['1994/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0014-4827(84)71097-4 [pii]', '10.1006/excr.1994.1097 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 1994 Apr;211(2):344-52. doi: 10.1006/excr.1994.1097.,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two independent methods were employed: (a) a spectrophotometric measurement of 10-N-nonyl acridine orange binding to isolated rat liver mitochondria, mitoplasts and inside-out submitochondrial particles, and (b) a flow-cytometric analysis of specific red fluorescence, emitted when two dye molecules are bound to one membrane cardiolipin; the stoichiometry of 10-N-nonyl acridine orange binding to phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylinositol, 1 mol dye/mol phospholipid, prevented dye dimerisation and subsequent red-fluorescence appearance. 57% total cardiolipin was present in the outer leaflets of inner membranes of isolated organelles, a distribution confirmed by saturation measurements for mitoplasts and inside-out submitochondrial particles. The same asymmetry was directly observed in situ with mitochondrial membranes of quiescent L1210 cells, and with mitochondrial membranes of respiring yeasts.

Established risk factors such as individual exposure to chemicals as well as hereditary genetic disorders were ruled out in interviews with the patients or their families. The general population in the region, however, is subjected to considerable doses of ionizing radiation due to high levels of external gamma radiation and high activities of indoor radon. Radiation-specific chromosome aberrations were found in one of two healthy siblings and one father of leukemia patients as well as in any of three probands living in houses with high indoor radon activities. Radon and natural gamma radiation, however, cannot explain the geographical pattern of the cases. Four out of seven cases were observed in two particular villages near a uranium processing plant. The drinking water of these villages partly came from a small river that was contaminated with radium-226 washed out from the dumps of the uranium plant. Only sparse measurements of 226Ra are available, but derived red bone marrow doses for children in the two villages obtained from a simple radio-ecological model show the significance of the drinking water pathway. Prenatal 226Ra exposure of fetuses due to placental transfer and accumulation may have led to significant doses and may explain the excess cases of childhood leukemia in the region even in quantitative terms.","['Hoffmann, W', 'Kranefeld, A', 'Schmitz-Feuerhake, I']","['Hoffmann W', 'Kranefeld A', 'Schmitz-Feuerhake I']","['Department of Medical Physics, University of Bremen, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Environ Health Perspect,Environmental health perspectives,0330411,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Ecology', '*Environmental Exposure', 'Fresh Water', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Radium/*adverse effects', 'Risk Factors', 'Water Pollutants, Radioactive/*adverse effects']",1993/10/01 00:00,1993/10/01 00:01,['1993/10/01 00:00'],"['1993/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1289/ehp.93101s3113 [doi]'],ppublish,Environ Health Perspect. 1993 Oct;101 Suppl 3:113-5. doi: 10.1289/ehp.93101s3113.,"['0 (Water Pollutants, Radioactive)', 'W90AYD6R3Q (Radium)']",,,,,,,,PMC1521172,,,,,,,,,,

Although in the latter case, tetrasomy 8 was evident in all karyotypes analyzed, in all other cases it constituted a subpopulation of cells other than those with trisomy 8 and those with a normal karyotype (in only one case another change was evident in the karyotype). Using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), the proportion of tetrasomic cells was determined in interphase nuclei. By this technique, small cell populations (3-9%) were detected in three additional trisomy cases. An additional ""control"" group of five trisomy cases did not show a significant population of tetrasomic interphase nuclei.

The test was subsequently applied to a bank of serum samples from 928 adult cows from 265 herds in Ontario; the number of cows sampled within each herd ranged from 1 to 13. The overall prevalence of anti-BIV antibodies among cows was 5.5% with a 95% confidence interval of 4.2% to 7.2%. In contrast, 18.1% of herds had at least one reactor among cows tested, resulting in a herd-prevalence confidence interval of 13.8% to 23.4%. These estimates of prevalence were in the same range as previous reports from the US and Europe. Bovine immunodeficiency-like virus may have a worldwide distribution. Unfortunately, BIV test sensitivity and specificity are difficult to estimate because virus isolation is inefficient. Therefore, the apparent prevalences could not be adjusted for test sensitivity and specificity, to estimate the true prevalence of infection. The serum samples had previously been tested for antibodies to bovine leukemia virus (BLV). There were no significant associations between BIV and BLV test results. Least squares regression was used to investigate potential associations between BIV test results and selected production indices.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['McNab, W B', 'Jacobs, R M', 'Smith, H E']","['McNab WB', 'Jacobs RM', 'Smith HE']","['Animal and Plant Health Directorate, Agriculture Canada, Nepean, Ontario.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Canada,Can J Vet Res,Canadian journal of veterinary research = Revue canadienne de recherche veterinaire,8607793,IM,"['Animal Husbandry', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/blood', 'Blotting, Western/methods', 'Cattle', 'Cattle Diseases/*epidemiology', 'Female', 'Immunodeficiency Virus, Bovine/*isolation & purification', 'Lactation', 'Lentivirus Infections/epidemiology/*veterinary', 'Luminescent Measurements', 'Ontario/epidemiology', 'Prevalence']",1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Can J Vet Res. 1994 Jan;58(1):36-41.,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)']",,,,,,,,PMC1263657,,,,,,,,,,

The median age of the population was 31.7 years (range 5.4 to 53) with 17 of 48 patients greater than 40 years of age. Twenty-seven patients were transplanted in chronic phase, 17 in accelerated phase, and 4 in blast crisis. All patients received a standardized preparative regimen of cyclophosphamide, high-dose cytosine arabinoside, methylprednisolone, and total body irradiation. Marrow grafts were depleted of mature T cells with the alpha beta T-cell receptor antibody T10B9 as graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis. All patients also received posttransplant cyclosporine therapy. Twenty-eight of 48 patients were mismatched with their donors for one or more HLA-A, B, DR, or DQ loci by either serology or high-resolution oligonucleotide genotyping. Nine of 28 were mismatched at multiple HLA loci. Durable engraftment was achieved in 94% (45/48) of patients. The actuarial probability of developing grades II to IV and grades III to IV acute GVHD were 39.6% (95% confidence interval (CI) 26.9 to 53.0) and 8.3% (95% CI 6.1 to 10.9) for the entire cohort. There was no difference in the incidence of grades II to IV acute GVHD between patients receiving matched (36.8%) or mismatched (41.4%) marrow grafts (P = .77). The actuarial probability of relapse at 2 years was 8.8% (95% CI 2.1 to 21.6) for the entire cohort and 18% (95% CI 4 to 41) for patients transplanted in either the accelerated or blast crisis phase (advanced disease). One cytogenetic relapse has occurred among patients transplanted in the chronic phase. The probability of disease-free survival at 2 years was 52% (95% CI 24 to 70) for patients transplanted in chronic phase and 46% (95% CI 25 to 73) for patients transplanted with advanced disease. No difference in disease-free survival was observed between patients receiving matched (49%) or mismatched (51%) marrow grafts (P = .90). This study shows that patients receiving unrelated T-cell-depleted marrow grafts for CML can achieve durable engraftment with a low incidence of severe GVHD and apparent preservation of graft-versus-leukemia reactivity. These data also suggest that T-cell depletion may allow patients who might otherwise experience unacceptable toxicity from GVHD-related complications caused by older age or increased HLA disparity to benefit from unrelated marrow grafts.","['Drobyski, W R', 'Ash, R C', 'Casper, J T', 'McAuliffe, T', 'Horowitz, M M', 'Lawton, C', 'Keever, C', 'Baxter-Lowe, L A', 'Camitta, B', 'Garbrecht, F']","['Drobyski WR', 'Ash RC', 'Casper JT', 'McAuliffe T', 'Horowitz MM', 'Lawton C', 'Keever C', 'Baxter-Lowe LA', 'Camitta B', 'Garbrecht F', 'et al.']","['Department of Medicine, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee 53226.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*immunology', 'Cause of Death', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*prevention & control', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/therapeutic use', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/mortality/*therapy', '*Lymphocyte Depletion', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recurrence', 'Survival Rate', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",1994/04/01 00:00,1994/04/01 00:01,['1994/04/01 00:00'],"['1994/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)73843-7 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1994 Apr 1;83(7):1980-7.,['83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)'],,,,['K08-CA01534/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The CML-specific chimeric BCR-ABL gene with a break involving the major breakpoint cluster region (M-bcr) of the BCR-gene has been detected by means of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). In this study, we present a FISH protocol that allows the detection of breaks in both the major and the minor breakpoint cluster region (m-bcr). Three hybridization signals of D107F9, a yeast artificial chromosome (YAC)-derived probe spanning the breakpoint regions of the BCR gene, were indicative of the translocation events. To increase the specificity further, this probe was combined with cos-abl 8, a cosmid probe flanking the breakpoint within the ABL gene for dual-color hybridization. Samples of 21 patients with CML, the ALL-derived cell line SUP-B15, and of seven patients with Philadelphia chromosome (Ph1)-positive ALL (three of them with breakpoints within m-bcr) were examined. BCR-ABL fusion was detected in all cases with high specificity (false-positive nuclei: mean, 0.1%). On cytogenetic preparations, the percentages of BCR-ABL-positive interphase cells ranged from 53% to 91%. Comparable efficiencies were achieved on blood smears. In conclusion, hybridization with D107F9 and cos-abl 8 allows unambiguous diagnosis of BCR-ABL genes and is likely to become an important tool for the monitoring of therapies in patients with CML and ALL.","['Bentz, M', 'Cabot, G', 'Moos, M', 'Speicher, M R', 'Ganser, A', 'Lichter, P', 'Dohner, H']","['Bentz M', 'Cabot G', 'Moos M', 'Speicher MR', 'Ganser A', 'Lichter P', 'Dohner H']","['Medizinische Klinik, Universitat Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Base Sequence', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Humans', '*In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', '*Proto-Oncogenes']",1994/04/01 00:00,1994/04/01 00:01,['1994/04/01 00:00'],"['1994/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)73835-8 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1994 Apr 1;83(7):1922-8.,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

From a series of 45 patients aged 1 to 15 years (42 B-lineage ALL, 3 T-ALL), 35 (83%) could be followed for minimal residual disease with at least one clonospecific probe. Detection of clonal markers using clonospecific probes routinely allowed the detection of 1 to 10 blasts out of 10(5) cells as determined by serial dilutions of the initial samples. Residual disease was quantitated by a competitive PCR assay based on the coamplification of an internal standard. Twenty children were prospectively followed for periods varying from 7 to 30 months. In most children, a progressive decrease of the tumor load was observed, and blasts became undetectable within 6 months after the initiation of treatment. A slower kinetics of decrease in tumor cells was found in three children. These three patients relapsed with blasts that continued to display the initial clonospecific markers. Three other children had a central nervous system relapse despite the absence of detectable medullary residual disease. The use of both delta and gamma TCR genes as clonal markers, as well as simplification in the methods to detect and quantify residual blasts reported here, will allow the study of the large number of patients required to determine the role of the detection of minimal residual disease by PCR in the follow-up of childhood ALL.","['Cave, H', 'Guidal, C', 'Rohrlich, P', 'Delfau, M H', 'Broyart, A', 'Lescoeur, B', 'Rahimy, C', 'Fenneteau, O', 'Monplaisir, N', ""d'Auriol, L""]","['Cave H', 'Guidal C', 'Rohrlich P', 'Delfau MH', 'Broyart A', 'Lescoeur B', 'Rahimy C', 'Fenneteau O', 'Monplaisir N', ""d'Auriol L"", 'et al.']","['Hopital Robert Debre; Faculte Bichat, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Base Sequence', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Gene Rearrangement, delta-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor', '*Gene Rearrangement, gamma-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Prospective Studies', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta/*genetics']",1994/04/01 00:00,1994/04/01 00:01,['1994/04/01 00:00'],"['1994/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)73832-2 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1994 Apr 1;83(7):1892-902.,"['0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is used in the induction of remission of patients with APL. We found, by using the promyelocytic NB4 cell line established from a patient with APL, that the induction of differentiation with RA was accompanied by modulation of the plasminogen activation system. The expression of urokinase (uPA) activity was rapidly increased in the growth medium and at the surface of cells treated with RA. The high uPA activity was counteracted both in the growth medium and at the cell surface by an increased plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI) production and reduction of uPA synthesis. The expression of uPA receptor and PAI-2 were stimulated and persisted at 48 hours from RA addition. The simultaneous induction of CD11b suggests that differentiation results in increased production of both. APL patients often encounter episodes of disseminated intravascular coagulation that are associated with secondary fibrinolytic events. Our results suggest that downregulation of uPA activity results in the decrease of plasmin on the surface of the differentiated cells, which may reduce the occurrence of fibrinolytic episodes of patients with APL.","['Tapiovaara, H', 'Matikainen, S', 'Hurme, M', 'Vaheri, A']","['Tapiovaara H', 'Matikainen S', 'Hurme M', 'Vaheri A']","['Department of Virology, University of Helsinki, Finland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Down-Regulation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/enzymology/*pathology', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Urokinase-Type Plasminogen Activator/antagonists & inhibitors/*biosynthesis/genetics']",1994/04/01 00:00,1994/04/01 00:01,['1994/04/01 00:00'],"['1994/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)73831-0 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1994 Apr 1;83(7):1883-91.,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'EC 3.4.21.73 (Urokinase-Type Plasminogen Activator)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When HL60 cells were induced to differentiate to granulocytes by dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or retinoic acid (RA), a marked downregulation in the levels of wt1 transcripts was found.

Nuclear run-on transcription studies showed the transcriptional rate of wt1 gene was not significantly altered during DMSO-induced granulocytic differentiation, suggesting the downregulation was mostly caused by posttranscriptional modification. Importantly, wt1 transcripts were not significantly altered in K562 cells by treatments with DMSO or RA, which do not induce differentiation of K562 cells.

A similar mechanism of Epo-R activation has previously been described in the T3CL-2 Friend erythroleukemia cell line. An elevated number of Epo-binding sites has been observed in two human erythroleukemia cell lines, TF-1 and UT7. In UT7 cells, homogeneously staining region of the short arm of chromosome 19 [hsr (19)] was evidenced, which contained an amplification of the Epo-R gene. This Epo-R gene amplification was confirmed by the quantification of Southern blots in which the intensity of the Epo-R signal was compared in UT7 DNA and in DNA from normal cells. The Epo-R gene was present in UT7 at a mean number of seven to eight copies per cell. Interestingly, the Epo-R gene was rearranged; the breakpoint region was located near the 3' end of the gene, 3 kb downstream from the end of the last exon. Taken together, these results suggest that, in both murine and human systems, genetic alterations of the Epo-R gene are not rare events and could be involved in the occurrence of the erythroleukemic process.","['Chretien, S', 'Moreau-Gachelin, F', 'Apiou, F', 'Courtois, G', 'Mayeux, P', 'Dutrillaux, B', 'Cartron, J P', 'Gisselbrecht, S', 'Lacombe, C']","['Chretien S', 'Moreau-Gachelin F', 'Apiou F', 'Courtois G', 'Mayeux P', 'Dutrillaux B', 'Cartron JP', 'Gisselbrecht S', 'Lacombe C']","['Institut National de Transfusion Sanguine et Unite INSERM U76, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Gene Amplification', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*etiology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Receptors, Erythropoietin/*genetics/physiology', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/04/01 00:00,1994/04/01 00:01,['1994/04/01 00:00'],"['1994/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)73822-X [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1994 Apr 1;83(7):1813-21.,"['0 (Receptors, Erythropoietin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To determine whether bFGF might act on progenitor cells by antagonizing the effects of cytokines that induce differentiation, we determined the effects of bFGF on the TGF-beta-mediated induction of hemoglobin synthesis in K562 cells. bFGF antagonized the TGF-beta-mediated induction of hemoglobin in a dose-dependent manner, with 0.1 ng/mL bFGF inhibiting hemoglobin induction by 40% and 10 ng/mL bFGF completely abrogating hemoglobin production. bFGF was most effective at antagonizing the TGF-beta-mediated induction of hemoglobin if it and TGF-beta were added simultaneously to K562 cells, but delayed addition of bFGF to TGF-beta-treated cultures still resulted in significant inhibition of hemoglobin synthesis. The inhibitory effects of bFGF on hemoglobin production were fully reversible, showing that bFGF did not permanently alter the phenotype of K562 cells. The hemin-mediated induction of hemoglobin synthesis in K562 cells was only partially negated by bFGF. bFGF also diminished the expression of glycophorin A on the surface of K562 cells.

However, little is known about signaling events initiated by both hematopoietins that occur downstream of the MAP kinase. MAP kinase has been shown to phosphorylate the AP-1 transcription factor and also to activate two kinases designated insulin-stimulated protein kinase-1 and MAP kinase-activated protein (MAP-KAP) kinase 2. We show here that IL-3 and GM-CSF induce MAPKAP kinase 2 activity in the human megakaryoblastic leukemia cell line MO7 and phosphorylate the human small heat shock protein Hsp 27 on serine residues in vitro. GM-CSF also induced Hsp 27 phosphorylation in neutrophils in a range similar to that observed in MO7 cells, suggesting that MAPKAP kinase 2-mediated Hsp 27 activation occurs independently of proliferation. Hsp 27 phosphorylation was dose-dependent, occurred as early as 5 minutes after factor exposure, and was inhibited by the tyrosine kinase inhibitors genistein and herbimycin A. Furthermore, the protein phosphatase A2 abolished IL-3- and GM-CSF-induced serine phosphorylation of Hsp 27. Taken together, our findings indicate that tyrosine phosphorylation of MAP kinase is a prerequisite for serine phosphorylation of Hsp 27, which is mediated by MAPKAP kinase 2. Hsp 27 has shown activation-dependent translocation from the cytosolic to the nuclear region and has been linked to the cellular stress response. However, its precise function is largely unknown. Our data identify Hsp 27 as a target of the IL-3/GM-CSF stimulation pathway that involves MAP kinase and MAPKAP kinase 2. In addition, our results indicate that Hsp 27 may be target of phosphorylation events not only in the stress response but also in unstressed cells responding to cytokine stimulation.","['Ahlers, A', 'Engel, K', 'Sott, C', 'Gaestel, M', 'Herrmann, F', 'Brach, M A']","['Ahlers A', 'Engel K', 'Sott C', 'Gaestel M', 'Herrmann F', 'Brach MA']","['Max-Delbruck Center for Molecular Medicine, Freie Universitat Berlin, Universitatsklinikum Rudolf Virchow, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Retracted Publication']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Benzoquinones', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology', 'Heat-Shock Proteins/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Lactams, Macrocyclic', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 2', '*Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Quinones/pharmacology', 'Rifabutin/analogs & derivatives', 'Serine/*metabolism']",1994/04/01 00:00,1994/04/01 00:01,['1994/04/01 00:00'],"['1994/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)73819-X [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1994 Apr 1;83(7):1791-8.,"['0 (Benzoquinones)', '0 (Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Lactams, Macrocyclic)', '0 (Quinones)', '1W306TDA6S (Rifabutin)', '452VLY9402 (Serine)', '70563-58-5 (herbimycin)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (MAP-kinase-activated kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (MAP2K2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases)']",,,,,,,,,,['Blood. 1999 May 15;93(10):3573.

In addition, recent data suggest that the structurally related B-myb gene is also necessary for the proliferation of these cells. To help understand the relationship between these two related gene products during proliferation and differentiation of myeloid cells, we have studied in parallel the regulated expression of c-myb and B-myb RNAs and proteins in human myeloid cells that were either growth-arrested or induced to differentiate along different pathways. For this purpose, we have produced a polyclonal antibody directed against a fragment of the recombinant B-myb protein. We have thus been able to detect the B-myb protein in human cell lines and have found it to be a 93-kD protein localized in the nucleus. We have chosen two models to study the expression of both c-myb and B-myb mRNAs and proteins during myeloid proliferation and differentiation. One of the models was the HL-60 cell line, which can be induced to differentiate towards the monocytic pathway with either phorbol ester (phorbol myristate acetate) or vitamin D3 and towards the granulocytic pathway with either dimethyl sulfoxide or retinoic acid. In addition, we have studied another recently established human leukemic cell line, called GF-D8, which is strictly dependent on granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) for proliferation. The results show that the expression of B-myb RNA and protein closely correlates with proliferation in all experimental setups studied, whereas the c-myb protein levels do not always do so. We observed that the c-myb protein levels decreased well before the decrease of B-myb protein and of proliferation itself during differentiation toward monocytes. Such a difference was not present during granulocytic differentiation, in which c-myb levels decreased, if anything, later than those of B-myb and proliferation. Most striking was the finding that high levels of c-myb RNA and protein, but not of B-myb, were present in the GF-D8 cell line, even after growth arrest by GM-CSF deprivation. These data suggest that B-myb may function solely in the regulation of cellular proliferation, whereas c-myb has additional functions, for example, in the maintenance of an undifferentiated state.","['Arsura, M', 'Luchetti, M M', 'Erba, E', 'Golay, J', 'Rambaldi, A', 'Introna, M']","['Arsura M', 'Luchetti MM', 'Erba E', 'Golay J', 'Rambaldi A', 'Introna M']","['Istituto di Ricerche Farmacologiche Mario Negri, Milano, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/genetics/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/analysis/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/04/01 00:00,1994/04/01 00:01,['1994/04/01 00:00'],"['1994/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)73818-8 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1994 Apr 1;83(7):1778-90.,"['0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",,,,,"['B-myb', 'c-myb']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hu-M195 is a computer-modeled, ""complementarity-determining region-grafted,"" IgG1, humanized version of M195. M195 is a murine monoclonal antibody that reacts with CD33, a 67-kD glycoprotein expressed on early myeloid progenitor cells and myeloid leukemia (acute myelogenous leukemia and chronic myelogenous leukemia) cells, but not normal stem cells. 131I-murine-M195 has already shown significant ability to cytoreduce patients with relapsed or refractory myeloid leukemias. Hu-M195 has higher avidity than the original mouse monoclonal antibody and, unlike murine M195, has the capability to mediate antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity against leukemia targets. Thirteen patients with relapsed or refractory myelogenous leukemia were treated with Hu-M195 at 4 levels of 0.5, 1.0, 3.0, and 10.0 mg/m2 in a phase I trial. Patients received a total of 6 doses per patient over 18 days. Two patients were retreated for a total of 12 doses. The first dose of Hu-M195 was trace-labeled with 131I to allow detailed pharmacokinetic and biodistribution studies by serial sampling of blood, radioimmunoassays of cells, and whole-body gamma-camera imaging. Cumulative total doses of up to 216 mg of Hu-M195 were administered safely. Reversible fever and rigors were observed after infusion at the highest dose levels. The entire bone marrow was specifically and clearly imaged within hours after infusion, with optimal biodistribution occurring at the 3 mg/m2 level. Adsorption of Hu-M195 onto targets in vivo was demonstrated by flow cytometry; near saturation of available sites occurred at the 3 mg/m2 dose level. Plasma and whole body half lives were 38 and 51 hours, respectively, which may reflect continual replenishment of target sites on new leukemia cells. 131I-Hu-M195 was rapidly internalized into the target cells in vivo within 1 hour. Human antihuman antibody responses were not observed. In conclusion, Hu-M195 can be administered safely in multiple doses, without significant toxicity or any evidence of immunogenicity, and can localize rapidly and efficiently to the bone marrow in patients with myeloid leukemias. Additional phase II trials with this agent alone or in combination with cytokines or isotopes are warranted at the optimal biologic dose.","['Caron, P C', 'Jurcic, J G', 'Scott, A M', 'Finn, R D', 'Divgi, C R', 'Graham, M C', 'Jureidini, I M', 'Sgouros, G', 'Tyson, D', 'Old, L J']","['Caron PC', 'Jurcic JG', 'Scott AM', 'Finn RD', 'Divgi CR', 'Graham MC', 'Jureidini IM', 'Sgouros G', 'Tyson D', 'Old LJ', 'et al.']","['Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York NY 10021.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Controlled Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/adverse effects/metabolism/*therapeutic use', 'Antigens, CD/*analysis/immunology', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/*analysis/immunology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3', 'Tissue Distribution']",1994/04/01 00:00,1994/04/01 00:01,['1994/04/01 00:00'],"['1994/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)73816-4 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1994 Apr 1;83(7):1760-8.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (CD33 protein, human)', '0 (Cd33 protein, mouse)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3)']",,,,"['P01CA33049/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA55349/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chimeric transcripts consisting of upstream CBFB fused to downstream MYH11 coding sequences result from this fusion. In this study we have examined a series of 37 of these cases using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to detect expression of a hybrid CBFB/MYH11 transcript. Chimeric cDNAs were detected in all but 1 of 37 leukemias with typical inv(16) or t(16;16). Such chimeric products were not seen in a case with inv(16)(p13q24) (ie, a variant q arm breakpoint) or any of 10 cases of AML without these chromosomal changes. Four different chimeric transcripts were found, representing differing fusion points within MYH11 spliced to position 495 of CBFB. Primer sets are described for efficient amplification of these different cDNA forms. Amplification of cDNA showed that all but 17 codons of the CBFB coding sequence are included in the abnormal transcripts. RT-PCR was shown to be highly sensitive and potentially useful for detection of leukemic cells during morphologic remission.","['Claxton, D F', 'Liu, P', 'Hsu, H B', 'Marlton, P', 'Hester, J', 'Collins, F', 'Deisseroth, A B', 'Rowley, J D', 'Siciliano, M J']","['Claxton DF', 'Liu P', 'Hsu HB', 'Marlton P', 'Hester J', 'Collins F', 'Deisseroth AB', 'Rowley JD', 'Siciliano MJ']","['Department of Hematology, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Base Sequence', '*Chromosome Inversion', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 16', '*Cloning, Molecular', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis']",1994/04/01 00:00,1994/04/01 00:01,['1994/04/01 00:00'],"['1994/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)73814-0 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1994 Apr 1;83(7):1750-6.,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)']",,,,"['CA167721/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA42557/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA55164/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['CRFB', 'MYH11']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated the hematopoietic colonies derived from the marrows of 12 patients with Ph+ CML in chronic phase by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) amplification of BCR-ABL mRNA and by cytogenetics. Colonies were individually harvested and each colony divided into two portions, one for cytogenetics and the other for isolation of total RNA for PCR of BCR-ABL transcripts and for an RNA internal control. We found that 23% +/- 18% (mean +/- SD, range 0% to 60%) of Ph+ colonies did not transcribe the aberrant gene. In each case when BCR-ABL transcription was not detected, normal ABL mRNA was present. The data suggest that hitherto unknown mechanisms may regulate BCR-ABL expression in some Ph+ cells and indicate that caution should be exercised in the interpretation of results using RT-PCR analysis of hematopoietic colonies from clinical specimens and from experiments with antisense oligonucleotides directed at the BCR-ABL gene. These data also raise the notion of a transitional Ph+ precursor cell in which BCR-ABL may become upregulated and lead to a fully expressed phenotype.

IL-4 (at 100 U/mL) was cytotoxic in 16 of 21 cases of B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia, causing reductions in CD19+ cell numbers that ranged from 50% to greater than 99% (median 83.5%) of those in parallel cultures not exposed to the cytokine. All nine cases with the t(9;22)(q34;q11) or the t(4;11)(q21;q23), chromosomal features that are often associated with multidrug resistance and a fatal outcome, were susceptible to IL-4 toxicity. IL-4 cytotoxicity resulted from induction of programmed cell death (apoptosis); there was no evidence of cell killing mediated by T, natural killer, or stromal cells. IL-4 cytotoxicity extended to a proportion of normal B-cell progenitors. After 7 days of culture with IL-4 at 100 U/mL, fewer CD19+, CD34+ normal lymphoblasts (the most immature subset) survived: in five experiments the mean (+/- SEM) reduction in cell recoveries caused by IL-4 was 60.0% +/- 6.0%. By contrast, reductions in recovery of more differentiated bone marrow B cells (CD19+, CD34-, surface Ig+) were low (6.6% +/- 2.2%; P < .001 by t-test).

Although several different genes have been cloned from translocation breakpoints, the great majority of translocations involve the MLL (myeloid-lymphoid leukaemia) gene. The MLL gene has several different names, ALL1, Htrx, HRX; the central part of the gene codes for multiple zinc fingers which show strong homology to the Drosophila trithorax gene. MLL is involved in four common translocations as well as in 25 uncommon or rare translocations, insertions and deletions. The translocation breakpoints occur within an 8.3 kb region which can be detected with a 0.74 kb cDNA probe. Twenty-five percent of patients have a deletion 3' of the breakpoint which includes the zinc finger region. Patients who previously received drugs that inhibit topoisomerase II often develop acute leukaemia with translocations involving 11q23. These translocations break MLL in the same 8.3 kb region. In the three breakpoints cloned to date, the translocation has led to a fusion gene on the derivative 11 chromosome with a chimaeric transcript, consisting of 5' MLL and the 3' segment of the other gene. Although transcripts were also cloned from the other derivative chromosome, all the evidence indicates that the critical fusion gene is on the derivative 11 chromosome. The molecular dissection of these rearrangements will provide insights into the biology of MLL and into the interaction of MLL with topoisomerase II inhibitors.

PML/RAR alpha, is implicated in leukaemogenesis, and may block myeloid differentiation directly and/or interfere with the normal function(s) of PML and/or RAR alpha.","['Gillard, E F', 'Solomon, E']","['Gillard EF', 'Solomon E']","['Somatic Cell Genetics Laboratory, Imperial Cancer Research Fund, London.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Semin Cancer Biol,Seminars in cancer biology,9010218,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 15/*ultrastructure', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17/*ultrastructure', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Factors/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/diagnosis/*genetics/therapy', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Neoplasm Proteins', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/physiology', '*Oncogenes', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/*genetics', 'Remission Induction', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Tretinoin/metabolism/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Zinc Fingers/genetics']",1993/12/01 00:00,1993/12/01 00:01,['1993/12/01 00:00'],"['1993/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Semin Cancer Biol. 1993 Dec;4(6):359-67.,"['0 (Immunologic Factors)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",,65,,,"['ERB-B2', 'PLZF', 'PML', 'RAR&agr;', 'RARA']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Both cell lines have similar amounts of the oxysterol binding protein with similar affinities for oxysterol. However, in neither line are the levels of oxysterol binding protein mRNA affected by 1 microM 25-hydroxycholesterol. Furthermore, both cells express the cellular nucleic acid binding protein (CNBP), a 7 zinc finger, DNA-binding protein of unknown function, regulated by oxysterols. The levels of CNBP mRNA are significantly reduced by 25-hydroxycholesterol in the sensitive CEM C7 cells, in which the dose response and time course are consistent with occupancy of the oxysterol binding protein by oxysterol and with subsequent cell kill. However, in the resistant M10 cells, CNBP mRNA levels are unaffected by these concentrations of the 25-hydroxycholesterol.

Taken together, these results indicate that resistance to VP-16 in a K562 subline is associated with a quantitative reduction in topoisomerase II protein and, in addition, a distinct qualitative alteration in topoisomerase II affecting the stability of drug-induced DNA-topoisomerase II complexes.","['Ritke, M K', 'Roberts, D', 'Allan, W P', 'Raymond, J', 'Bergoltz, V V', 'Yalowich, J C']","['Ritke MK', 'Roberts D', 'Allan WP', 'Raymond J', 'Bergoltz VV', 'Yalowich JC']","['Department of Pharmacology, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pennsylvania 15261.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Cell Nucleus/drug effects', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/genetics/*metabolism', 'DNA, Neoplasm/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Drug Resistance/genetics/*physiology', 'Etoposide/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*enzymology/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Topoisomerase II Inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/enzymology']",1994/04/01 00:00,1994/04/01 00:01,['1994/04/01 00:00'],"['1994/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/bjc.1994.131 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1994 Apr;69(4):687-97. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1994.131.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)']",,,,"['CA-21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-39426/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-51657/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,PMC1968798,,,,,,,,,,

Cell death was characterised as being by apoptosis: cells with an intact plasma membrane had condensed chromatin and were characterised as having approximately 300 kbp fragments when DNA integrity was analysed by pulsed-field electrophoresis. Onset of apoptosis required a minimum of 36 h exposure to 5 microM dexamethasone; before this time no apoptotic cells were observed. This 36 h incubation period appeared to be necessary to prime the cells for subsequent death by apoptosis. In the continued presence of dexamethasone the percentage of apoptotic cells increased to 60% apoptotic cells by 54 h. Investigation of changes in c-myc protein showed that it was undetectable after 12 h of incubation with dexamethasone, although cells were not committed to die at this time. Cells were treated with dexamethasone for 54 h and for various pulsed periods with a non-toxic concentration of cycloheximide (200 nM). When cycloheximide was present during the first 36 h priming period of dexamethasone treatment, there was an immediate loss of c-myc protein and apoptosis at 54 h was completely inhibited. In contrast, there was no inhibition of apoptosis when dexamethasone-treated cells were incubated with an 18 h pulse of cycloheximide added after 36 h. Cells exposed to dexamethasone for 36 h ('primed') were given various periods of dexamethasone-free incubation before readdition of dexamethasone for a further 18 h. The longer the cells were free of drug after priming, the less susceptible they became to apoptosis, suggesting a slow decay of their 'memory' of the initial 36 h period of exposure. Cycloheximide inhibited the decay of this memory. Removal of dexamethasone after a 36 h exposure was characterised by a subsequent 24 h suppression of c-myc protein expression. Despite this, 90% of cells became refractory to apoptosis before the reappearance of c-myc protein. The evidence does not support the hypothesis that changes in c-myc expression are required for the engagement of apoptosis of CEM cells.","['Wood, A C', 'Waters, C M', 'Garner, A', 'Hickman, J A']","['Wood AC', 'Waters CM', 'Garner A', 'Hickman JA']","['Cancer Research Campaign Molecular and Cellular Pharmacology Group, School of Biological Sciences, University of Manchester, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Dexamethasone/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Pulsed-Field', 'G1 Phase/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/analysis/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*drug effects']",1994/04/01 00:00,1994/04/01 00:01,['1994/04/01 00:00'],"['1994/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/bjc.1994.128 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1994 Apr;69(4):663-9. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1994.128.,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)']",,,,['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],,,,PMC1968827,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, alterations in phosphodiester (PDE) signals are sometimes seen. The present study of a murine lymphoma growing in liver showed a positive correlation between the hepatic PME/PDE ratio measured in vivo by 31P MRS at 4.7 T and the degree of lymphomatous infiltration in the liver, quantified by histology. High-resolution 31P MRS of liver extracts at 9.7 T showed that the PME peak consists largely of phosphoethanolamine (PE) and to a lesser extent of phosphocholine (PC). The concentration of both PE and PC increased positively with lymphomatous infiltration of the liver. In vivo, the PDE peak contains signals from phospholipids (mostly phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylcholine) and the phospholipid breakdown products glycerophosphoethanolamine (GPE) and glycerophosphocholine (GPC). Low levels of GPE and GPC were detected in the aqueous extracts of the control and infiltrated livers; their concentrations remained unchanged as the infiltration increased. The total concentration of phospholipids measured by 31P MRS of organic extracts decreased about 3-fold as the infiltration increased to 70%. Thus, our data showed that the increased PME/PDE ratio in vivo is due to both an increase in the PME metabolites and a decrease in the PDE metabolites. We propose that this ratio can be used as a non-invasive measure of the degree of lymphomatous infiltration in vivo.","['Thomas, C P', 'Dixon, R M', 'Tian, M', 'Butler, S A', 'Counsell, C J', 'Bradley, J K', 'Adams, G E', 'Radda, G K']","['Thomas CP', 'Dixon RM', 'Tian M', 'Butler SA', 'Counsell CJ', 'Bradley JK', 'Adams GE', 'Radda GK']","['Department of Biochemistry, University of Oxford, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,IM,"['Animals', 'Liver Neoplasms, Experimental/*metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/*metabolism/pathology', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred CBA', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Organophosphates/*metabolism', 'Phospholipids/metabolism', 'Phosphorus/*metabolism', 'Phosphorus Isotopes', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*metabolism/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/metabolism']",1994/04/01 00:00,1994/04/01 00:01,['1994/04/01 00:00'],"['1994/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/bjc.1994.124 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1994 Apr;69(4):633-40. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1994.124.,"['0 (Organophosphates)', '0 (Phospholipids)', '0 (Phosphorus Isotopes)', '27YLU75U4W (Phosphorus)']",,,,,,,,PMC1968832,,,,,,,,,,

A new synthetic route was developed using dimethoxy derivatives as key compounds that reacted with ceric ammonium nitrate (CAN) to give quinones by oxidation demethylation. The biological results obtained in vitro indicated that: (i) new quinones display cytotoxicity higher than that of the methoxyquinones; (ii) unsubstituted compounds are the most active; (iii) methylation of the pyrrole NH has no influence on unsubstituted quinones, but affords inactive derivatives when the quinone nucleus is methylated; (iv) compared to the aziridinyl-quinones, some compounds are equally active or more active.

The superficial cervical lymph nodes from 3 BLV-infected but apparently healthy sheep and 5 sheep with full-blown lymphosarcoma were examined. We also investigated the integration of bovine leukemia provirus by use of Southern blotting. In lymph nodes from sheep lacking clinical signs of infection, in which the provirus had been integrated at multiple sites in the genome, many large hypertrophic follicles were observed in the cortex. These follicles had germinal centers consisting of CD4+T cells and B cells that expressed surface IgM (sIgM) and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class-II antigens, but not B cell-specific B2 molecule. The percentage of CD4+T cells in the cortex was significantly (P < 0.05) higher than that of the controls and sheep with lymphosarcoma. In all sheep with lymphosarcoma, the lymph nodes were completely destroyed by proliferating neoplastic cells, and in addition, small atrophic follicles, which consisted of normal B-cell marker-positive cells, were seen near the trabecula and the subcapsule. In these instances, neoplastic cells appeared to be a monoclonal population derived from a single CD5- B-cell lineage and to be classified as 2 types, CD5-CD4-CD8-B2+MHC class-II+sIgM+ and CD5-CD4-CD8-B2+MHC class-II+sIgM-.

A report of five cases.,347-56,"Tissue eosinophilia is commonly seen in Hodgkin's disease and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas of T-cell lineage. In contrast, eosinophilia is infrequent in non-Hodgkin's lymphomas of B-cell origin. We describe five-B-cell lymphomas with exuberant tissue eosinophils. According to the Working Formulation, three were classified as large-cell immunoblastic, one as small lymphocytic lymphoma/chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and one as low-grade, not further subclassified, with features of monocytoid B-cell lymphoma. Immunophenotypic studies in each case revealed B-cell lineage; neoplastic cells expressed monotypic immunoglobulin light chain (four of five cases) or pan-B-cell antigens (five of five cases) and were negative for T-cell antigens. Southern blot hybridization in one case revealed immunoglobulin gene rearrangements, further confirming B-cell lineage. Eosinophilopoiesis is stimulated by interleukin 5 (IL-5), and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) has been shown to upregulate IL-5 production. Therefore, both EBV infection and IL-5 expression were investigated as possibly pathogenetic mechanisms for the eosinophilia. However, both in situ hybridization studies for EBV mRNA and IL-5 mRNA were negative in the neoplastic cells. In one tumor, IL-5 was abundant in the cytoplasm of the eosinophils, a pattern similar to that seen in five cases of Hodgkin's disease studied with the same technique. Although rare, marked tissue eosinophilia may be associated with B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. Immunophenotypic or molecular genetic analyses are needed to make the correct diagnosis.","['Navarro-Roman, L', 'Medeiros, L J', 'Kingma, D W', 'Zarate-Osorno, A', 'Nguyen, V', 'Samoszuk, M', 'Jaffe, E S']","['Navarro-Roman L', 'Medeiros LJ', 'Kingma DW', 'Zarate-Osorno A', 'Nguyen V', 'Samoszuk M', 'Jaffe ES']","['Hematopathology Section, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Am J Surg Pathol,The American journal of surgical pathology,7707904,IM,"['Adult', 'Eosinophilia/*etiology/pathology', 'Female', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Interleukin-5/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/complications', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*complications/immunology/microbiology', 'Lymphoma, Large-Cell, Immunoblastic/complications', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/complications', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",1994/04/01 00:00,1994/04/01 00:01,['1994/04/01 00:00'],"['1994/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00000478-199404000-00003 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Surg Pathol. 1994 Apr;18(4):347-56. doi: 10.1097/00000478-199404000-00003.,['0 (Interleukin-5)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When MEL cells were exposed to 1.8% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) for a maximum of 7 days, they synthesized hemoglobin and reduced their volume by 66% while maintaining their water content. The total protein content decreased by 50%. We therefore concluded that the volume reduction was due to a loss of cellular material, water, and osmolytes. To evaluate the changes in pump and leak pathways, we performed 86Rb uptakes in the presence or absence of selected inhibitors. In undifferentiated cells, the uptake was mainly represented by the Na-K-2Cl cotransport (51%) and by the Na(+)-K+ pump (34%). A small portion of the uptake was mediated by barium- and quinidine-sensitive K+ channels (8%) and by the furosemide-sensitive K-Cl cotransporter (5%). After 4 days in DMSO, the 86Rb uptake was reduced by 57%, mainly due to a substantial (90%) decrease in Na-K-2Cl cotransport activity. The Na(+)-independent K-Cl cotransport activity also dramatically decreased by a factor of 10. In contrast, the Na(+)-K+ pump activity did not change after 4 days in DMSO. These results demonstrate a marked reduction in the activities of inorganic ion cotransport systems as red blood cells differentiate to reticulocytes. Our study also demonstrates that a strong correlation exists between cell volume reduction and a decrease in the main inward leak pathway for K+: the Na-K-2Cl cotransporter.","['Delpire, E', 'Gullans, S R']","['Delpire E', 'Gullans SR']","[""Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Physiol,The American journal of physiology,0370511,IM,"['Animals', 'Biological Transport', 'Bumetanide/pharmacology', 'Carrier Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Potassium/*metabolism', 'Rubidium/pharmacokinetics', 'Sodium-Potassium-Chloride Symporters', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Water/metabolism']",1994/02/01 00:00,1994/02/01 00:01,['1994/02/01 00:00'],"['1994/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1152/ajpcell.1994.266.2.C515 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Physiol. 1994 Feb;266(2 Pt 1):C515-23. doi: 10.1152/ajpcell.1994.266.2.C515.,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Sodium-Potassium-Chloride Symporters)', '059QF0KO0R (Water)', '0Y2S3XUQ5H (Bumetanide)', 'MLT4718TJW (Rubidium)', 'RWP5GA015D (Potassium)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Expressed as saturation of the monocyte surface lactoferrin binding capacity, values of 97.2% +/- 22.6% for males and 76.6% +/- 14.3% for females were calculated. Intermediate values of surface lactoferrin were found in B-lymphocyte-rich isolates from five patients with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia. In T-lymphocyte-rich preparations, there were low levels of native lactoferrin expression (154 +/- 63 molecules of lactoferrin/cell; 3 isolates).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The chest radiographs and CT scans of seven patients with biopsy-proved metastatic pulmonary calcification were reviewed by two observers. Metastatic calcification was due to chronic renal failure (n = 4), T-cell leukemia (n = 1), multiple endocrine neoplasia type I syndrome (n = 1), and idiopathic hypercalcemia (n = 1). RESULTS: Numerous nodular opacities measuring 3-10 mm in diameter were seen on the chest radiographs in five cases, and patchy areas of parenchymal opacification were seen in two cases. Calcification of the nodules was evident in two cases. On CT scans, pulmonary nodules were present in all seven cases. These nodules were predominant in the upper lung zone in three cases, were diffuse in three cases, and were predominant in the lower lung zone in one case. Calcification of the nodules was evident on the CT scans in four of the seven cases, and calcification of vessels in the chest wall was evident in six of seven cases. Other findings on CT scans included diffuse areas of ground-glass attenuation (n = 3) and patchy consolidation (n = 2). CONCLUSION: Numerous small nodules are the most common finding on the chest radiographs of patients with metastatic pulmonary calcification. The calcific nature of the nodules is seldom obvious, however. Pulmonary nodules are also the most common finding on CT scans, where the calcific nature of the nodules is more readily apparent. Additionally, calcification is often seen in the vessels of the chest wall on CT scans. The combination of calcified nodules and calcified vessels in the chest wall on CT scans may be characteristic.","['Hartman, T E', 'Muller, N L', 'Primack, S L', 'Johkoh, T', 'Takeuchi, N', 'Ikezoe, J', 'Swensen, S J']","['Hartman TE', 'Muller NL', 'Primack SL', 'Johkoh T', 'Takeuchi N', 'Ikezoe J', 'Swensen SJ']","['Department of Radiology, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,AJR Am J Roentgenol,AJR.

Lymphocyte depletion of donor bone marrow for preventing GVHD has been associated with a higher incidence of relapse after allogeneic BMT. This association suggests an antileukaemic effect of donor lymphocytes. In vitro studies show that cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CD3+ CD56+) and NK cells (CD3-CD56+) have an antileukaemic effect. To know which specific subpopulation of lymphocytes are depleted by counterflow centrifugation or elutriation, we analysed B, T, NK cells and hematopoietic precursors in the marrow fractions after this procedure. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eight patients (6 CML, 1 ALL, 1 B-CLL) received an allogeneic BMT with lymphocyte depletion of the bone marrow graft using elutriation. After a Percoll gradient, donor marrow mononuclear cells (MNC) were separated with this method in five fractions (F1 to F5). RESULTS: Lymphocyte depletion of donor marrow was in average of 1.7 log. This depletion was also selective, the last fraction containing higher number of cytotoxic T lymphocytes and NK cells than the other fractions. Recovery of CD34+ cells in the four fractions concerning to post-Percoll marrow was 84%, most of them being in the last fraction. CONCLUSIONS: The use of elutriation for lymphocyte depletion is a good method for graft manipulation with the feasibility to adjust a lymphocyte/Kg. dose. Elutriation may be effective in reducing the incidence and severity of graft versus host disease and preserving the antileukaemic effect.","['Merino, A', 'Urbano-Ispizua, A', 'Marin, P', 'Besson, I', 'Carreras, E', 'Sierra, J', 'Salgado, C', 'Rovira, M', 'Granena, A', 'Montserrat, E']","['Merino A', 'Urbano-Ispizua A', 'Marin P', 'Besson I', 'Carreras E', 'Sierra J', 'Salgado C', 'Rovira M', 'Granena A', 'Montserrat E', 'et al.']","['Escuela de Hematologia Farreras-Valenti, Hospital Clinico y Provincial de Barcelona.']",['spa'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Spain,Sangre (Barc),Sangre,0404373,IM,"['Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*pathology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Centrifugation/instrumentation/*methods', 'Countercurrent Distribution', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/prevention & control', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Humans', '*Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia/pathology/surgery', '*Lymphocyte Depletion', 'Lymphocyte Subsets/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Povidone', 'Silicon Dioxide']",1993/10/01 00:00,1993/10/01 00:01,['1993/10/01 00:00'],"['1993/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Sangre (Barc). 1993 Oct;38(5):359-64.,"['65455-52-9 (Percoll)', '7631-86-9 (Silicon Dioxide)', 'FZ989GH94E (Povidone)']",,,,,,Estudio inmunofenotipico de las fracciones medulares obtenidas mediante elutriacion en el trasplante alogenico de medula osea.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because metabolites from these pathways have proinflammatory properties, CI-986 was evaluated in several acute and chronic models of inflammation and hyperalgesia. The compound inhibited swelling in the carrageenan footpad edema, Mycobacterium foot-pad edema and adjuvant arthritis models of inflammation with ID40 values of 1.0, 7.7., and 7.2 mg/kg, respectively. It was roughly equivalent in potency to the standard selective cyclooxygenase inhibitor, naproxen (ID40 = 0.7, 6.3, and 3.8 mg/kg, respectively). CI-986 was also evaluated in the acetic acid induced writhing hyperalgesia assay (ID50 = 0.23 mg/kg) and was approximately equipotent with indomethacin (ID50 = 0.87 mg/kg). Although the effects of CI-986 were similar to those of standard nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in the inflammation models, its gastrointestinal profile was unique. CI-986 caused no gastrointestinal irritation at doses up to 200 mg/kg in acute and chronic studies. In contrast, standard NSAIDs caused ulcers at doses of 3.7-37 mg/kg after a single dose. Moreover, CI-986 inhibited the release of LTC4 and PGE2 by gastric mucosa and reduced mucosal and vascular damage induced by oral administration of absolute ethanol to rats. These results indicate that CI-986 is a potent nonulcerogenic antiinflammatory agent with novel pharmacologic properties.","['Schrier, D J', 'Baragi, V M', 'Connor, D T', 'Dyer, R D', 'Jordan, J H', 'Imre, K M', 'Lesch, M E', 'Mullican, M D', 'Okonkwo, G C', 'Conroy, M C']","['Schrier DJ', 'Baragi VM', 'Connor DT', 'Dyer RD', 'Jordan JH', 'Imre KM', 'Lesch ME', 'Mullican MD', 'Okonkwo GC', 'Conroy MC']","['Parke-Davis Pharmaceutical Research Division, Warner-Lambert Company, Ann Arbor, MI 48105.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Prostaglandins,Prostaglandins,0320271,IM,"['Animals', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/*therapeutic use', 'Arachidonic Acid/*metabolism', 'Arthritis, Experimental/drug therapy', 'Cyclooxygenase Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Dinoprost/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Ethanol', 'Female', 'Gastritis/chemically induced/*drug therapy', 'Inflammation/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Leukotriene B4/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis', 'Lipoxygenase Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Pain/*drug therapy', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Thiadiazoles/*therapeutic use', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0090-6980(94)90071-X [pii]', '10.1016/0090-6980(94)90071-x [doi]']",ppublish,Prostaglandins. 1994 Jan;47(1):17-30. doi: 10.1016/0090-6980(94)90071-x.,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal)', '0 (Cyclooxygenase Inhibitors)', '0 (Lipoxygenase Inhibitors)', '0 (Thiadiazoles)', '130116-16-4 (CI 986)', '1HGW4DR56D (Leukotriene B4)', '27YG812J1I (Arachidonic Acid)', '3K9958V90M (Ethanol)', 'B7IN85G1HY (Dinoprost)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In transgenic mice, p56lck is oncogenic when overexpressed or expressed as a mutant, catalytically activated enzyme. In humans, the LCK gene is located at the breakpoint of the t(1;7)(p34;q34) chromosomal translocation. This translocation positions the beta T-cell receptor constant region enhancer upstream of the LCK gene without interrupting the LCK coding sequences, and a translocation of this sort occurs in both the HSB2 and the SUP-T-12 T-cell lines. We have found that, although the level of the p56lck protein in HSB2 cells is elevated approximately 2-fold in comparison with that in normal T-cell lines, total cellular tyrosine protein phosphorylation is elevated approximately 10-fold. Increased levels of phosphotyrosine in HSB2 cells resulted from mutations in the LCK gene that activated its function as a phosphotransferase and converted it into a dominant transforming oncogene. The oncogenic p56lck in HSB2 cells contained one amino acid substitution within the CD4/CD8-binding domain, two substitutions in the kinase domain, and an insertion of Gln-Lys-Pro (QKP) between the SH2 and kinase domains. In NIH 3T3 fibroblasts, three of these mutations cooperated to produce the fully oncogenic form of this p56lck variant. These results suggest that mutation of LCK may contribute to some human T-cell leukemias.","['Wright, D D', 'Sefton, B M', 'Kamps, M P']","['Wright DD', 'Sefton BM', 'Kamps MP']","['Department of Pathology, University of California, School of Medicine, San Diego, La Jolla 92093-0612.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Chromosome Mapping', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 1', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7', 'Cloning, Molecular', '*Conserved Sequence', 'DNA Transposable Elements', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*genetics', 'Lymphocyte Specific Protein Tyrosine Kinase p56(lck)', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phosphorylation', '*Point Mutation', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Reference Values', 'T-Lymphocytes/enzymology', 'Transfection', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/04/01 00:00,1994/04/01 00:01,['1994/04/01 00:00'],"['1994/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/mcb.14.4.2429-2437.1994 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1994 Apr;14(4):2429-37. doi: 10.1128/mcb.14.4.2429-2437.1994.,"['0 (DNA Transposable Elements)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Lymphocyte Specific Protein Tyrosine Kinase p56(lck))']",,,,"['2 PO1 CA50528-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA14105/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA42350/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['LCK'],,['GENBANK/U07236'],PMC358610,,,,,,,,,,

A profound example of cell homeostasis, controlled throughout life, is the complex process of blood cell development, yet little is understood about the intracellular mechanisms that regulate blood cell growth arrest and programmed cell death. In this work, using transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF beta 1)-treated M1 myeloid leukemia cells and genetically engineered M1 cell variants, the regulation of growth arrest and apoptosis was dissected. Blocking of early expression of MyD118, a novel differentiation primary response gene also shown to be a primary response gene induced by TGF beta 1, delayed TGF beta 1-induced apoptosis, demonstrating that MyD118 is a positive modulator of TGF beta 1-mediated cell death. Elevated expression of bcl-2 blocked the TGF beta 1-induced apoptotic pathway but not growth arrest induced by TGF beta 1. Deregulated expression of either c-myc or c-myb inhibited growth arrest and accelerated apoptosis, demonstrating for the first time that c-myb plays a role in regulating apoptosis. In all cases, the apoptotic response was correlated with the level of MyD118 expression. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that the primary response gene MyD118 and the c-myc, c-myb, and bcl-2 proto-oncogenes interact to modulate growth arrest and apoptosis of myeloid cells.","['Selvakumaran, M', 'Lin, H K', 'Sjin, R T', 'Reed, J C', 'Liebermann, D A', 'Hoffman, B']","['Selvakumaran M', 'Lin HK', 'Sjin RT', 'Reed JC', 'Liebermann DA', 'Hoffman B']","['Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia 19104-6059.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,IM,"['Animals', '*Antigens, Differentiation', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/*genetics', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Clone Cells', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', '*Genes, myc', 'Genetic Variation', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Mice', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/genetics', 'Proteins/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/04/01 00:00,1994/04/01 00:01,['1994/04/01 00:00'],"['1994/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/mcb.14.4.2352-2360.1994 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1994 Apr;14(4):2352-60. doi: 10.1128/mcb.14.4.2352-2360.1994.,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Gadd45b protein, mouse)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",,,,"['1RO1CA43618/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1RO1CA51162/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['MyD118', 'bcl-2', 'c-myb', 'c-myc', 'myb', 'myc']",,,PMC358602,,,,,,,,,,

Clonogenic progenitor cell assays of cells from the bone marrow and spleens of these infected mice suggest that EPO-R(R129C) can stimulate proliferation of committed megakaryocytic and erythroid progenitors as well as nonerythroid multipotent progenitors. From the spleens of SFFVcEPO-R-infected mice, eight multiphenotypic immortal cell lines were isolated and characterized. These included primitive erythroid, lymphoid, and monocytic cells. Some expressed proteins characteristic of more than one lineage. All cell lines resulting from SFFVcEPO-R infection contained a mutant form of the p53 gene. However, in contrast to infection by SFFV, activation of PU.1 gene expression, by retroviral integration, was not observed. One cell line had integrated a provirus upstream of the fli-1 gene, in a location typically seen in erythroleukemic cells generated by Friend murine leukemia virus infection. This event led to increased expression of fli-1 in this cell line. Thus, infection by SFFVcEPO-R can induce proliferation and lead to transformation of nonerythroid as well as very immature erythroid progenitor cells. The sites of proviral integration in clonal cell lines are distinct from those in SFFV-derived lines.","['Longmore, G D', 'Pharr, P N', 'Lodish, H F']","['Longmore GD', 'Pharr PN', 'Lodish HF']","['Department of Medicine, Washington University, St. Louis, Missouri 63110.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,IM,"['Animals', 'Blood Platelets/*cytology', 'Bone Marrow/physiology', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Erythrocyte Count', 'Erythrocytes/*cytology', 'Female', '*Genes, env', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/physiology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/blood', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Platelet Count', 'Receptors, Erythropoietin/biosynthesis/*physiology', 'Retroviridae Infections/blood', 'Spleen/cytology/physiology', 'Spleen Focus-Forming Viruses/*genetics', 'Tumor Virus Infections/blood']",1994/04/01 00:00,1994/04/01 00:01,['1994/04/01 00:00'],"['1994/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/mcb.14.4.2266-2277.1994 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1994 Apr;14(4):2266-77. doi: 10.1128/mcb.14.4.2266-2277.1994.,"['0 (Receptors, Erythropoietin)']",,,,"['HL32262/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'NIA AG00294/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States']",['env'],,,PMC358593,,,,,,,,,,

Although noncytotoxic concentrations of herbimycin A induced erythroid differentiation of two CML-derived cell lines, K562 and KU812, in a previous study, the differentiation-inducing effect of herbimycin A on Ph1-positive ALL cell lines was less strong. Herbimycin A enhanced some differentiation-associated properties of one Ph1-positive ALL cell line, L2, but the effect of herbimycin A on the other Ph1-positive ALL cell lines was cytotoxic rather than cytostatic (differentiation-inducing). Several derivatives of herbimycin A were synthesized and their effects on the cell proliferation of Ph1-positive CML and ALL cell lines were examined. The sensitivities of the Ph1-positive cell lines to herbimycin A derivatives were different from the data on the rat kidney cell line infected with Rous sarcoma virus (v-src) derived from a previous study, suggesting bcr/abl kinase may differ in sensitivity from other tyrosine kinases.

ADF/thioredoxin has several biologic functions, such as defense against cellular damage, activity to scavenge oxidative stress by hydrogen peroxide radicals and cytokine-like properties. We hypothesized that under certain conditions, ischemia followed by reperfusion and/or light exposure, ADF may be induced in the retina. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: To test this hypothesis, we prepared experimental animal models in which oxidative stress could be applied to the retina. In the present study, we examined ADF expression in the rat retina using temporary ischemia and reperfusion, and photodynamic retinal vascular thrombosis by immunohistochemical and Western blotting methods. RESULTS: ADF expression was strongly induced in the retinal pigment epithelial cells after 2 hours of ischemia followed by 2, 24, or 48 hours of reperfusion. ADF was also expressed in retinal pigment epithelial cells as early as 3 hours after light exposure followed by rose bengal injection, and this expression increased with time. Western blotting data showed that ADF expression increased in the retinal pigment epithelial cells in the experimental group, as compared with the control group. These results indicate that ADF is actively induced in retinal pigment epithelial cells upon oxidative stress. CONCLUSIONS: ADF induction in retinal pigment epithelial cells may be involved in the defense mechanism against cellular damage caused by active oxygen species generated during oxygen stress to the retina.","['Ohira, A', 'Honda, O', 'Gauntt, C D', 'Yamamoto, M', 'Hori, K', 'Masutani, H', 'Yodoi, J', 'Honda, Y']","['Ohira A', 'Honda O', 'Gauntt CD', 'Yamamoto M', 'Hori K', 'Masutani H', 'Yodoi J', 'Honda Y']","['Department of Ophthalmology, Faculty of Medicine, Kyoto University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Lab Invest,Laboratory investigation; a journal of technical methods and pathology,0376617,IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Western', '*Cytokines', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Ischemia/*metabolism', 'Light', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Reperfusion Injury/*metabolism', 'Retina/*metabolism', 'Retinal Vein Occlusion/metabolism', 'Rose Bengal', 'Thioredoxins/*biosynthesis']",1994/02/01 00:00,1994/02/01 00:01,['1994/02/01 00:00'],"['1994/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Lab Invest. 1994 Feb;70(2):279-85.,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (adult T cell leukemia-derived factor)', '1ZPG1ELY14 (Rose Bengal)', '52500-60-4 (Thioredoxins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we examined whether apoptosis was involved in ts1-induced killings of T cells. Neonatal mice were inoculated with ts1, and 20 to 23 days postinoculation, when cytopathic effects on T cells normally appear, thymocytes and splenic lymphocytes were isolated and examined. Our results showed that several features of apoptosis were present in ts1-infected thymocytes and splenic lymphocytes. Apoptotic fragmented DNA, condensation of the chromatin, and enhanced cell death after stimulation with mitogens which was preventable with protein synthesis inhibitors, all of which are common features of apoptotic cell death, were observed in ts1-infected cells. Several other viruses, including human immunodeficiency virus, have been shown to cause apoptotic death of T cells. Here we show for the first time that a murine retrovirus which also induces immunodeficiency can cause apoptotic T-cell death.

These U3 elements were derived from viruses with different tissue tropism. The 5' LTR originated from Moloney murine leukemia virus and directed the transcription of a reporter gene (chloramphenicol acetyltransferase [CAT] gene), giving rise to plasmids of the general configuration LTR-CAT-LTR'. Following transfection of these chimeric constructs into various cell types, the CAT activity in a given cell line was inversely related to the activity of the downstream U3 region when used in a single-LTR construct in that cell type, indicating negative regulation of the 5' LTR by the chimeric 3' LTR'. Our data indicate that a highly active 3' LTR interferes with gene expression from the 5' LTR.

However, the limiting steps in CD4-dependent HIV-1 infections in vivo and in vitro are poorly understood. To address this issue, we produced a panel of HeLa-CD4 cell clones that express widely different amounts of CD4 and quantitatively analyzed their infection by laboratory-adapted and primary patient HIV-1 isolates. For all HIV-1 isolates, adsorption from the medium onto HeLa-CD4 cells was inefficient and appeared to be limiting for infection in the conditions of our assays. Adsorption of HIV-1 onto CD4-positive peripheral blood mononuclear cells was also inefficient. Moreover, there was a striking difference between laboratory-adapted and primary T-cell-tropic HIV-1 isolates in the infectivity titers detected on different HeLa-CD4 cells. Laboratory-adapted HIV-1 isolates infected all HeLa-CD4 cell clones with equal efficiencies regardless of the levels of CD4, whereas primary HIV-1 isolates infected these clones in direct proportion to cellular CD4 expression. Our interpretation is that for laboratory-adapted isolates, a barrier step that preceeds CD4 encounter was limiting and the subsequent CD4-dependent virus capture process was highly efficient, even at very low cell surface concentrations. In contrast, for primary HIV-1 isolates, the CD4-dependent steps appeared to be much less efficient. We conclude that primary isolates of HIV-1 infect inefficiently following contact with surfaces of CD4-positive cells, and we propose that this confers a selective disadvantage during passage in rapidly dividing leukemia cell lines. Conversely, in vivo selective pressure appears to favor HIV-1 strains that require large amounts of CD4 for infection.","['Kabat, D', 'Kozak, S L', 'Wehrly, K', 'Chesebro, B']","['Kabat D', 'Kozak SL', 'Wehrly K', 'Chesebro B']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Oregon Health Sciences University, Portland 97201-3098.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['*Adaptation, Biological', 'Adsorption', 'CD4 Antigens/genetics/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'HIV-1/*growth & development/isolation & purification', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/microbiology', 'Selection, Genetic', 'Serial Passage', 'Virus Cultivation/methods', 'Virus Replication/drug effects']",1994/04/01 00:00,1994/04/01 00:01,['1994/04/01 00:00'],"['1994/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.68.4.2570-2577.1994 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1994 Apr;68(4):2570-7. doi: 10.1128/JVI.68.4.2570-2577.1994.,['0 (CD4 Antigens)'],,,,"['AI28572/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA25810/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,PMC236734,,,,,,,,,,

Using genomic DNA from cat necropsy samples, we employed PCR to amplify and clone the envelope gene, which is a major determinant of the specific pathogenicity of different FeLV variants. In the envelope gene, mutations encoded scattered amino acid changes that did not cluster into clearly definable variable regions; however, characterization of these terminal variant sequences revealed a predominance of G-to-A and A-to-G nucleotide substitutions. Additionally, some cats harbored variants with recombinant subgroup B-like envelope genes, while the major variant from one cat had a 12-bp insertion in a region previously characterized as an immunodeficiency-inducing determinant. Finally, proviruses from tumor DNA frequently possessed envelope genes predicted to encode a protein truncated in the N-terminal half because of either premature termination codons or deletions ranging from 29 to 1,666 bp. In contrast, all envelope genes cloned from the bone marrow of one cat were predicted to encode full-length envelope product, and only a minority of proviral clones from a cat that did not develop a tumor had defective envelope genes. Thus, in the cat, viruses evolved from subgroup A FeLV that had point mutations, insertions, deletions, or recombinant envelope genes. Furthermore, defective variants were particularly prominent in T-cell tumors.","['Rohn, J L', 'Linenberger, M L', 'Hoover, E A', 'Overbaugh, J']","['Rohn JL', 'Linenberger ML', 'Hoover EA', 'Overbaugh J']","['Department of Microbiology, University of Washington, Seattle 98195.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cats', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Genes, env/*genetics', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome, Viral', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/*genetics', 'Lymphoma/*microbiology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis', 'Proviruses/genetics', 'Retroviridae Infections/*microbiology', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Thymus Neoplasms/*microbiology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*microbiology']",1994/04/01 00:00,1994/04/01 00:01,['1994/04/01 00:00'],"['1994/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.68.4.2458-2467.1994 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1994 Apr;68(4):2458-67. doi: 10.1128/JVI.68.4.2458-2467.1994.,,,,,"['A127757/PHS HHS/United States', 'CA51080/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM07270/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,"['GENBANK/L25942', 'GENBANK/L25943', 'GENBANK/L25944', 'GENBANK/L25945', 'GENBANK/L25946', 'GENBANK/L25947', 'GENBANK/L25948', 'GENBANK/L25949', 'GENBANK/L25950', 'GENBANK/L25951', 'GENBANK/L25952', 'GENBANK/L25953', 'GENBANK/L25954', 'GENBANK/L25955', 'GENBANK/L25956', 'GENBANK/L25957', 'GENBANK/L25958', 'GENBANK/L25959', 'GENBANK/L25960', 'GENBANK/L25961', 'GENBANK/L25962', 'GENBANK/L25963', 'GENBANK/L25964', 'GENBANK/L25965', 'GENBANK/L25966', 'GENBANK/L25967', 'GENBANK/L25968', 'GENBANK/L25969', 'GENBANK/L25970', 'GENBANK/L25971']",PMC236723,,,,,,,,,,

Using a panel of 156 (Mus musculus x Mus spretus) x Mus musculus interspecific backcross mice, we mapped Tpl-1 to mouse chromosome 9 at a distance of 1.2 +/- 0.9 centimorgans from the Ets-1 proto-oncogene (S.E. Bear, A. Bellacosa, P.A. Lazo, N.A. Jenkins, N.G. Copeland, C. Hanson, G. Levan, and P.N. Tsichlis, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86:7495-7499, 1989). In this report, we present evidence that all the known Tpl-1 provirus insertions occurred immediately 5' of the first exon of Ets-1 (exon A) and that the earlier detected distance between Tpl-1 and Ets-1 was due to the high frequency of meiotic recombination in the region between the site of provirus integration and exon III. Northern (RNA) blot analysis of polyadenylated RNA from normal adult rat tissues and Moloney murine leukemia virus-induced T-cell lymphomas and hybridization to a Tpl-1/Ets-1 probe derived from the 5' end of the gene revealed two lymphoid cell-specific RNA transcripts, of 5.5 and 2.2 kb. Sequence analysis of a near-full-length (4,991-bp) cDNA clone of the 5.5-kb RNA revealed a 441-amino-acid open reading frame encoding a protein identical to the human and mouse Ets-1 proteins with the exception of five and nine species-specific conservative amino acid differences, respectively. The steady-state level of the Tpl-1/Ets-1 RNA and of the Ets-1 protein was modestly elevated in tumors carrying a provirus in the Tpl-1 locus. The relative ratio of the two Ets-1 transcripts, which were shown to arise by differential polyadenylation, was not affected by provirus insertion. Moreover, the major site of transcriptional initiation, which was localized by primer extension 250 bp upstream of the 5' end of the Ets-1 cDNA clone, was shown to be identical in normal cells and tumors carrying a provirus in the Tpl-1 locus. Finally, the differential splicing of Ets-1 exon VII was shown by RNase protection to occur at a rate of 15 to 26% and to remain unaffected by provirus insertion. The subtlety of these effects, in contrast to the strong growth selection of cells with a provirus in the Tpl-1/Ets-1 locus, suggests that provirus insertion may affect the fine regulation of the gene, perhaps during cell cycle progression.","['Bellacosa, A', 'Datta, K', 'Bear, S E', 'Patriotis, C', 'Lazo, P A', 'Copeland, N G', 'Jenkins, N A', 'Tsichlis, P N']","['Bellacosa A', 'Datta K', 'Bear SE', 'Patriotis C', 'Lazo PA', 'Copeland NG', 'Jenkins NA', 'Tsichlis PN']","['Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19111.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Alternative Splicing', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/*microbiology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Protein c-ets-1', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets', '*RNA Processing, Post-Transcriptional', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred F344', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', '*Transcription Factors', 'Virus Integration/*genetics']",1994/04/01 00:00,1994/04/01 00:01,['1994/04/01 00:00'],"['1994/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.68.4.2320-2330.1994 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1994 Apr;68(4):2320-30. doi: 10.1128/JVI.68.4.2320-2330.1994.,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (ETS1 protein, human)', '0 (Ets1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Ets1 protein, rat)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Protein c-ets-1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",,,,"['N01-CO-74101/CO/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'RR-05539/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,,"['GENBANK/L20681', 'GENBANK/L20682', 'GENBANK/L21899', 'GENBANK/L21900', 'GENBANK/L21901']",PMC236708,,,,,,,,,,

These elements can recombine with exogenous, infectious FeLVs of subgroup A (FeLV-A), giving rise to host range variants of FeLV-B. We found that a subset of defective enFeLV proviruses is highly expressed in lymphoma cell lines and in a variety of primary tissues, including lymphoid tissues from healthy specific-pathogen-free cats. At least two RNA species were detected, a 4.5-kb RNA containing gag, env, and long terminal repeat sequences and a 2-kb RNA containing env and long terminal repeat sequences. Cloning of enFeLV cDNA from two FeLV-free lymphoma cell lines (3201 and MCC) revealed a long open reading frame (ORF) encoding a truncated env gene product corresponding to the N-terminal portion of gp70env. Interestingly, all of three natural FeLV-B isolates include 3' env sequences which are missing from the highly transcribed subset and hence must be derived from other enFeLV elements. The enFeLV env ORF cDNA clones were closely similar to a previously characterized enFeLV provirus, CFE-16, but were polymorphic at a site corresponding to an exogenous FeLV neutralization epitope. Site-specific antiserum raised to a C-terminal 30-amino-acid peptide of the enFeLV env ORF detected an intracellular product of 35 kDa which was also shed from cells in stable form. Expression of the 35-kDa protein correlated with enFeLV RNA levels and was negatively correlated with susceptibility to infection with FeLV-B. Cell culture supernatant containing the 35-kDa protein specifically blocked infection of permissive fibroblast cells with FeLV-B isolates. We suggest that the truncated env protein mediates resistance by receptor blockade and that this form of enFeLV expression mediates the natural resistance of cats to infection with FeLV-B in the absence of FeLV-A.","['McDougall, A S', 'Terry, A', 'Tzavaras, T', 'Cheney, C', 'Rojko, J', 'Neil, J C']","['McDougall AS', 'Terry A', 'Tzavaras T', 'Cheney C', 'Rojko J', 'Neil JC']","['Beatson Institute for Cancer Research, CRC Beatson Laboratories, Bearsden, Glasgow, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cats', 'Defective Viruses/*genetics/growth & development', 'Genes, Viral/genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/microbiology', 'Immunity, Innate', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/*pathogenicity', 'Lymphoid Tissue/*microbiology', 'Lymphoma/microbiology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligonucleotide Probes', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Proviruses/*genetics/growth & development', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Viral/genetics', 'Retroviridae Infections/*immunology', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*immunology', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/genetics']",1994/04/01 00:00,1994/04/01 00:01,['1994/04/01 00:00'],"['1994/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.68.4.2151-2160.1994 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1994 Apr;68(4):2151-60. doi: 10.1128/JVI.68.4.2151-2160.1994.,"['0 (Oligonucleotide Probes)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",,,,['AI 25722/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,PMC236690,,,,,,,,,,

The average life span of MHE226-infected chickens is half that of E26-infected chickens. MHE226-infected chickens harbor tumors scattered in many organs, but compared with E26, MHE226 induced a weak leukemia. Study of integration sites suggests that the majority of the tumors results from clonal or oligoclonal events. Cell cultures were derived from the tumors of MHE226-infected chickens and grown in standard medium without addition of exogenous chicken myelomonocytic growth factor.

We investigated the effects of reduced H-2Db expression on recovery from Friend disease by using H-2b homozygous mice carrying a single beta 2-microglobulin gene disruption.

Currently the molecular mechanisms of these complex sequential events are unknown. It seemed reasonable to us to assume that communication between cells through soluble mediators during bone induction by rhBMP-2 may play an important role in the sequential differentiation of chondroblasts, osteoblasts, and osteoclasts. We have therefore used a human osteoblast-like initial transfectant cell line (HOBIT) to study the effect of rhBMP-2 on gene expression of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1), both of which affect osteogenesis and ostoeclastogenesis. Our results have demonstrated that rhBMP-2 acts on HOBIT cells to stimulate expression of IL-6 and TGF-beta 1 genes and the production of IL-6. Enhancement of gene expression of IL-6 and TGF-beta 1 by rhBMP-2 was both sensitive (half maximal effect at approximately 10 ng/ml) and potent (maximum induction was approximately four and threefold greater than controls, respectively). Time course studies showed that the induction of TGF-beta 1 and IL-6 mRNA occurs within short periods--4 and 8 hours after exposure to rhBMP-2, respectively. Interestingly, these effects, however, were not accompanied by the mitogenic action of rhBMP-2. It suggests that rhBMP-2 enhances IL-6 and TGF-beta 1 production during osteogenesis and at least in part mediates the complex sequential differentiation of chondroblasts, osteoblasts, and osteoclasts during rhBMP-2-induced endochondral ossification.","['Zheng, M H', 'Wood, D J', 'Wysocki, S', 'Papadimitriou, J M', 'Wang, E A']","['Zheng MH', 'Wood DJ', 'Wysocki S', 'Papadimitriou JM', 'Wang EA']","['Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, University of Western Australia, Nedlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,IM,"['Blotting, Northern', 'Bone Morphogenetic Proteins', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Gene Expression/*genetics', 'Growth Inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/*genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/genetics/metabolism', 'Osteoblasts/chemistry/*cytology/*metabolism', 'Proteins/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis/genetics/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/*genetics/metabolism']",1994/04/01 00:00,1994/04/01 00:01,['1994/04/01 00:00'],"['1994/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.1041590111 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 1994 Apr;159(1):76-82. doi: 10.1002/jcp.1041590111.,"['0 (Bone Morphogenetic Proteins)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)']",,,,,"['IL-6', 'TGF-&bgr;1']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

In acute hepatitis A a strong expression (10 of 10 patients) of the MxA protein and the 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase activity in peripheral-blood mononuclear cells was observed during the first 2 wk after onset of clinical symptoms. In this period the MxA protein concentrations reached levels similar to those measured in patients treated with up to 5 x 10(6) IU interferon-alpha three times a week. Beyond wk 3, in eight of eight patients with hepatitis A no increased MxA protein levels were found. In contrast, peripheral-blood mononuclear cells from patients with acute hepatitis B contained either no measurable MxA protein or only slightly higher levels of the MxA protein, as did those of most patients (12 of 14) with acute hepatitis C. The MxA protein levels of both hepatitis B and C patients were significantly lower (p < 0.05) than those found in hepatitis A patients. Furthermore, sera from 6 of 10 patients with hepatitis A, but none of 10 patients with acute hepatitis B and C, contained measurable MxA protein.

Glutamine analogues L-[alpha S,5S]-alpha-amino-3-chloro-4,5-dihydro-5-isoxazoleacetic acid (acivicin) and 6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine (DON) have been shown to possess cytotoxic activity against a wide variety of animal and human xenografted solid tumours, however their potential in man has been limited by toxicity. 2. We have analysed the effects of acivicin and DON on glutamine utilization to determine whether the reason for the disappointing therapeutic profile is solely due to the inefficient inhibition of glutamine metabolism. 3. Human myeloid leukaemic cells treated with acivicin inhibited ribonucleotide biosynthesis but not energy production via glutaminolysis and had little effect on viability, whereas treatment with DON inhibited both ribonucleotide biosynthesis and glutamine oxidation and resulted in reduced viability. 4. Treatment of the myeloid leukaemic cells with the glucose analogue 2-deoxy-D-glucose in addition to DON potentiated the inhibition of de novo nucleotide biosynthesis, glutaminolysis and glycolysis, and caused a further reduction in cell viability. 5. These results provide further support for the essential role of glutamine in cellular metabolism, and indicate that use of the glutamine analogue DON in the treatment of acute myeloid leukaemia may be more clinically effective if used in combination with 2-deoxy-D-glucose.","['Griffiths, M', 'Keast, D', 'Patrick, G', 'Crawford, M', 'Palmer, T N']","['Griffiths M', 'Keast D', 'Patrick G', 'Crawford M', 'Palmer TN']","['University Department of Microbiology, Queen Elizabeth II Medical Centre, Nedlands, WA, Australia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Int J Biochem,The International journal of biochemistry,0250365,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*therapeutic use', 'Deoxyglucose/therapeutic use', 'Diazooxonorleucine/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Isoxazoles/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/12/01 00:00,1993/12/01 00:01,['1993/12/01 00:00'],"['1993/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0020-711x(88)90303-5 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Biochem. 1993 Dec;25(12):1749-55. doi: 10.1016/0020-711x(88)90303-5.,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Isoxazoles)', '03J0H273KZ (Diazooxonorleucine)', '9G2MP84A8W (Deoxyglucose)', 'O0X60K76I6 (acivicin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To investigate the effects of LIF on the lymphoid system, we generated a line of transgenic mice that expresses diffusible LIF protein specifically in T cells. These mice display two categories of phenotype that were not previously attributed to LIF overexpression. First, they display B cell hyperplasia, polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia and mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis, defects similar to those described for transgenic mice overexpressing the functionally related cytokine, interleukin-6. Secondly, the LIF transgenic mice display novel thymic and lymph node abnormalities. In the thymus, cortical CD4+CD8+ lymphocytes are lost, while numerous B cell follicles develop. Peripheral lymph nodes contain a vastly expanded CD4+CD8+ lymphocyte population. Furthermore, the thymic epithelium is profoundly disorganized, suggesting that disruption of stroma-lymphocyte interactions is responsible for many observed defects. Transplantation of transgenic bone marrow into wild type recipients transfers both the thymic and lymph node defects. However, transplantation of wild type marrow into transgenic recipients rescues the lymph node abnormality, but not the thymic defect, indicating the thymic epithelium is irreversibly altered. Our observations are consistent with a role for LIF in maintaining a functional thymic epithelium that will support proper T cell maturation.","['Shen, M M', 'Skoda, R C', 'Cardiff, R D', 'Campos-Torres, J', 'Leder, P', 'Ornitz, D M']","['Shen MM', 'Skoda RC', 'Cardiff RD', 'Campos-Torres J', 'Leder P', 'Ornitz DM']","['Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,IM,"['Animals', 'Blood', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'CD4-CD8 Ratio', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Epithelium/metabolism', 'Growth Inhibitors/genetics/*physiology', 'Hypergammaglobulinemia/etiology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymph Nodes/cytology/*metabolism', 'Lymphokines/genetics/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Phenotype', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/immunology', 'Thymus Gland/cytology/*metabolism']",1994/03/15 00:00,1994/03/15 00:01,['1994/03/15 00:00'],"['1994/03/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/03/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/03/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,EMBO J. 1994 Mar 15;13(6):1375-85.,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)']",,,,,,,,PMC394955,,,,,,,,,,

One of the early complications is an acute graft versus host reaction. The objective of the investigation was to evaluate the relationship between the number of active lymphocytes in the patient's blood stream after bone marrow transplantation and the development of an acute graft versus host reaction or rejection of the graft, and thus contribute towards prediction or diagnosis of these complications. METHODS AND RESULTS: In 14 patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (3), acute lymphatic leukaemia (1), chronic myeloid leukaemia (6), myelodysplastic syndrome (2) and aplastic anaemia (2) bone marrow was transplanted: the donor was in all instances a HLA identical sibling. However, only 11 patients were evaluated. In the latter changes in the number of circulating active lymphocytes were assessed: their activity was evaluated from nucleolar characteristics expressed by RNA synthesis. Their values at the time of the acute graft versus host reaction (GVHD) varied between 7.4% and 17.3%; at the time when these patients were free from complications they were 2.2%-6.0% (the difference is at the borderline of significance). In 8 patients the rise of active lymphocytes preceded the manifestation of the graft versus host reaction by 3-7 days. At the time of infectious complications after bone marrow transplantation (temperatures of obscure origin, herpetic infections, varicella, adenoviral infections) the number of active lymphocytes did not increase (2.0%-10.0%), as compared with 3.4%-9.5% in the group without complications. CONCLUSIONS: The increased percentage of activated lymphocytes in the peripheral blood stream of patients with an acute graft versus host reaction (GVHD) after bone marrow transplantation results from specific immunological procedures. Their assessment could help with the differential diagnostic difficulties frequently associated with the diagnosis of the acute graft versus host reaction.","['Hrabanek, J', 'Lukasova, M', 'Chudomel, V', 'Smetana, K']","['Hrabanek J', 'Lukasova M', 'Chudomel V', 'Smetana K']","['Ustav hematologie a krevni transfuze, Praha.']",['cze'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Czech Republic,Cas Lek Cesk,Casopis lekaru ceskych,0004743,IM,"['*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Graft Rejection/diagnosis', 'Graft vs Host Disease/diagnosis', 'Humans', '*Lymphocyte Activation']",1994/01/31 00:00,1994/01/31 00:01,['1994/01/31 00:00'],"['1994/01/31 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/31 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/31 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cas Lek Cesk. 1994 Jan 31;133(3):80-2.,,,,,,,Monitorovani aktivnich lymfocytu v periferni krvi pacientu po transplantaci kostni drene.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent insights into the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationship between etoposide and teniposide systemic exposure and both toxicity and outcome offer a basis for more rational approaches to drug dosage, with the emphasis on systemic exposure achieved, rather than the amount of drug administered per body surface area. Recent studies indicate that chronic--for example 21 days--administration of low dose etoposide may be a more effective dosage schedule for some malignancies. Until the longer term toxicities have been assessed, enthusiasm for this new dosage schedule must be tempered by the potential for greater risk of second malignancies, which has been associated with the frequent--weekly or twice weekly--administration of larger intravenous doses. Measurement of active intracellular drug (and metabolite) concentrations have identified correlations for toxicity and clinical efficacy for such drugs as methotrexate, 6-mercaptopurine, cytarabine and platinum complexes (Plunkett et al, 1985; Reed et al, 1987; Lennard and Lilleyman, 1989; Whitehead et al, 1990).

Among hundreds of analogues, only a few have reached routine clinical use. Their main metabolic feature is the reduction of a ketone group to an hydroxyl group, giving an -ol derivative generally less active than the parent compound. Anthracyclines are characterized by a rapid distribution phase and a slow elimination phase. The successive half-lives of doxorubicin in plasma are about 5 minutes, 1 hour and 30 hours. Its total plasma clearance is about 30 l/hr/m2, and its total volume of distribution at steady state is approximately 15 l/kg. Anthracyclines are excreted mostly through bile, and special care must be taken with their use in patients with hepatic dysfunction. The new anthracyclines of clinical interest in solid tumours (epirubicin, pirarubicin) are more lipophilic than doxorubicin and have a higher volume of distribution and an increased total plasma clearance. Idarubicin is active in leukaemia rather than against solid tumours, and an oral form is available. Because of their high tissue fixation, these new anthracyclines are of particular interest for locoregional therapy, especially through the hepatic artery. Myelosuppression is the dose-limiting toxicity of anthracyclines and is related to drug exposure, so that pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationships have been clearly established for these drugs. A new subfamily, characterized by a morpholino group, presents very original features such as direct covalent linking to DNA after cytochrome P450 activation. These molecules are active at 100-fold lower concentrations than the conventional anthracyclines and are currently in clinical trials.","['Robert, J', 'Gianni, L']","['Robert J', 'Gianni L']","['Fondation Bergonie, Bordeaux.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Cancer Surv,Cancer surveys,8218015,IM,"['Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics', 'Drug Carriers', 'Humans', 'Immunotoxins/therapeutic use', 'Injections, Intra-Arterial', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Surv. 1993;17:219-52.,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Drug Carriers)', '0 (Immunotoxins)']",,188,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ara-C, the thiopurines and MTX are active drugs for both induction and maintenance chemotherapy of childhood and adult leukaemia, while the new adenosine analogues are active against hairy cell leukaemia, with promising activity against other malignancies such as malignant lymphomas. Methotrexate and 5FU are being used in the treatment of several solid malignancies. Recent advances in the clinical pharmacology of widely used antimetabolites have shown a relationship among dose, plasma concentrations and clearance with the toxicity and anti-tumour activity. Thus, it has been shown that adaptative control of 5FU administration is possible, limiting the toxicity of this drug. Recent advances in the pharmacogenetics of, for example, 6MP and 5FU will possibly enable researchers to identify patients who may have an increased risk of toxicity. For ara-C, some evidence has been obtained to identify populations at risk of no response. In addition, for most anti-metabolites, convincing evidence of their intracellular (intratumour) metabolism has been obtained, thus making it possible to identify patients who are likely to respond to treatment. These studies (eg accumulation of active metabolites such as ara-CTP, thioguanine nucleotides, FdUMP, MTX-polyglutamates; and inhibition of target enzymes such as thymidylate synthase) have made it possible to develop the basis of biochemical modulation--that is, specific manipulation of intracellular metabolism of the drug. It is anticipated that new technical developments in molecular biology, biochemistry, cell biology and immunology will make it possible to improve the identification of resistant patients in order to modulate specifically drug metabolism in the tumour cells. Biochemical modulation has been successful in achieving significant improvements in treatment and currently is a keystone in cancer chemotherapy. Together with the development of promising new anti-metabolites, biochemical modulation (with other drugs, biologicals) will be a major strategy for the future.","['Peters, G J', 'Schornagel, J H', 'Milano, G A']","['Peters GJ', 'Schornagel JH', 'Milano GA']","['Department of Oncology, Free University Hospital, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Cancer Surv,Cancer surveys,8218015,IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacokinetics', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/pharmacokinetics', 'Arabinofuranosylcytosine Triphosphate/pharmacokinetics', 'Cytarabine/pharmacokinetics', 'Fluorouracil/pharmacokinetics', 'Humans', 'Mercaptopurine/pharmacokinetics', 'Methotrexate/pharmacokinetics', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Surv. 1993;17:123-56.,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '13191-15-6 (Arabinofuranosylcytosine Triphosphate)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",,163,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Subsequent to our identification of the t(8;21) breakpoint region on chromosome 21, we reported that the translocation results in the fusion of the AML1 gene on chromosome 21 with a novel gene on chromosome 8 which we called ETO (for eight twenty-one). Recently, the AML1 portion of the fusion protein has been shown to correspond to the DNA-binding and dimerization domains of the mouse gene, polyoma enhancer binding protein 2 alpha B (pebp 2 alpha B). We report here the complete sequence of the ETO portion of the fusion transcript as compiled from complementary DNAs from a t(8;21) AML patient and compare this with the ETO sequence from a mouse brain transcript. The deduced amino acid sequences are 99% identical. ETO has several features consistent with it being a transcription factor. The ETO sequence is different from the portion of PEBP 2 alpha B it replaces in the AML1/ETO fusion protein, except for their common high content of proline, serine, and threonine residues. Because neither the putative zinc fingers nor the TAF110 homology domain of ETO is present in PEBP2 alpha B, one might expect functional differences in the ability of AML1/ETO protein to affect the levels of transcription of genes normally regulated to some degree by AML1 (PEBP2 alpha B) during myeloid differentiation. The relatively high levels of ETO in developing brain suggest that it could be involved in the regulation of some aspect of neural proliferation or differentiation.","['Erickson, P F', 'Robinson, M', 'Owens, G', 'Drabkin, H A']","['Erickson PF', 'Robinson M', 'Owens G', 'Drabkin HA']","['Division of Medical Oncology, University of Colorado Health Sciences and Cancer Center, Denver 80262.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', '*Biological Evolution', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Brain/metabolism', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Conserved Sequence', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Gene Library', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Organ Specificity', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis/biosynthesis', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Transcription Factors/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1994/04/01 00:00,1994/04/01 00:01,['1994/04/01 00:00'],"['1994/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1994 Apr 1;54(7):1782-6.,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (RUNX1T1 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",,,,['P01-HD017449/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States'],"['AML1', 'ETO']",,['GENBANK/X79990'],,,,,,,,,,,

Resistant cells often display a multidrug-resistant phenotype that reduces the promise of combination chemotherapy, the classic approach to the prevention of drug resistance. mdr1, a member of the ABC cassette superfamily of transporters which encodes an energy-dependent drug efflux pump, is the only gene known to confer the multidrug-resistant phenotype. Other multidrug resistance mechanisms must exist, since cell lines which have this phenotype in the absence of mdr1 overexpression have been described. We report here the application of a novel approach involving expression complementary DNA library transfer to the identification of drug-resistant genes. Using this approach we establish that mrp, a member of the ABC cassette superfamily of transporters, is capable of conferring a multidrug-resistant phenotype.

GM2 is thought to be one of the T-cell-independent antigens and to elicit only IgM antibody responses in rodents and humans. We have previously established two murine anti-GM2 monoclonal antibodies with high specificity and strong binding activity, KM696 and KM697, both of which are of the IgM class. Variable heavy and light chain complementary DNAs of these two murine monoclonal antibodies were cloned and used in the construction of mouse/human IgG1 chimeric antibodies, KM966 and KM967, respectively, in this study. One of the chimeric antibodies, KM966, retained strong and specific reactivity with GM2 and showed the similarity of the binding activity with tumor cell lines to that of the original murine monoclonal antibody. Indirect immunofluorescence staining of tumor cell lines with the chimeric KM966 revealed that the antigen was expressed in substantial amounts on pulmonary tumor cells and leukemia cells as well as neuroectodermal origin tumor cells. When human serum and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells were used as effectors in complement-dependent cytotoxicity and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, respectively, chimeric KM966 was fully effective in killing GM2-expressing tumor cells. In addition, i.v. injection of chimeric KM966 markedly suppressed the establishment of human tumor xenografts in nude mice. Taken together, chimeric KM966 is the first antibody of the human IgG class to ganglioside GM2 and has strong antitumor activity both in vitro and in vivo. It is likely that chimeric KM966 will be a useful agent for passive immunotherapy of human cancer.","['Nakamura, K', 'Koike, M', 'Shitara, K', 'Kuwana, Y', 'Kiuragi, K', 'Igarashi, S', 'Hasegawa, M', 'Hanai, N']","['Nakamura K', 'Koike M', 'Shitara K', 'Kuwana Y', 'Kiuragi K', 'Igarashi S', 'Hasegawa M', 'Hanai N']","['Division of Immunology, Tokyo Research Laboratories, Kyowa Hakko Kogyo Co., Ltd., Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/genetics/immunology/*pharmacology', 'Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Base Sequence', 'Complement System Proteins/immunology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Flow Cytometry', 'G(M2) Ganglioside/*immunology', 'Gene Expression/genetics', 'Genetic Vectors/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Light Chains/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin M/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin gamma-Chains/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Rats', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/*pharmacology', 'Transfection', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']",1994/03/15 00:00,1994/03/15 00:01,['1994/03/15 00:00'],"['1994/03/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/03/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/03/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1994 Mar 15;54(6):1511-6.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Light Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Immunoglobulin gamma-Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '19600-01-2 (G(M2) Ganglioside)', '9007-36-7 (Complement System Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, little is known about the signaling mechanisms responsible for this effect. The present work has asked whether ionizing radiation exposure is associated with changes in phosphorylation of proteins in HL-60 myeloid leukemia cells. The results demonstrate increased tyrosine phosphorylation of a M(r) 34,000 substrate. This effect was detectable at 1 to 10 min after irradiation and was induced by doses of 50 to 500 cGy. Immunoprecipitation studies further suggest that this substrate is the serine/threonine p34cdc2 protein kinase.

Prior to bone marrow transplantation (BMT) the increased protein levels and increased cell numbers noted in two children were probably caused by arachnoiditis from MTX administration 5 days earlier. After BMT, cell numbers increased in 54% of children and in 27% of children increased protein levels were found in the CSF. No correlation with clinical findings including neurological findings, infections and prior intrathecal MTX administration was found.

Univariate and multivariate analyses identified the mode of total body irradiation (TBI) as the only independent predictive factor of transplant-related mortality. Ninety-one patients received single-dose TBI and 93 received fractionated-dose TBI as part of the conditioning regimen prior to BMT. Transplant-related mortality was more frequent in the single dose group (p = 0.017). The incidence of interstitial pneumonitis, acute and chronic GVHD and veno-occlusive disease of the liver was not statistically different between the two irradiation groups. However, fatal interstitial pneumonitis was significantly more frequent in the single dose irradiation group (p = 0.031). These results show that transplant-related mortality is closely associated with the mode of TBI administration.

Monocytic maturation may be induced in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) blasts and the U937 leukaemic cell line by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25(OH)2D3], an effect which is augmented by both gamma interferon (IFN) or granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF). We have demonstrated that, while 1,25(OH)2D3 and GM-CSF alone have little effect, both IFN and GM-CSF act synergistically with 1,25(OH)2D3 to increase neopterin secretion in the U937 cell line. Neopterin secretion was associated with, but not necessarily dependent on, the degree of phenotypic differentiation achieved by cells. Neopterin secretion was also synergistically enhanced in AML blasts by the action of 1,25(OH)2D3 in combination with IFN but not GM-CSF; secretion was enhanced in AML blasts without concomitant evidence of phenotypic maturation. We have shown that the monocytoid cell line U937, under appropriate conditions, may secrete neopterin in response to stimulatory agents other than IFN. In addition, the distinct difference in the pattern of response to the combination of 1,25(OH)2D3 with GM-CSF compared with that of 1,25(OH)2D3 plus IFN suggests that the augmentation of 1,25(OH)2D3 effect by IFN and GM-CSF is mediated by separate mechanisms.","['Kelsey, S M', 'Coldwell, R D', 'Makin, H L', 'Syndercombe-Court, D', 'Newland, A C']","['Kelsey SM', 'Coldwell RD', 'Makin HL', 'Syndercombe-Court D', 'Newland AC']","['Department of Haematology, Royal London Hospital, Whitechapel, England.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Steroid Biochem Mol Biol,The Journal of steroid biochemistry and molecular biology,9015483,IM,"['Biopterin/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Calcitriol/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Neopterin', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0960-0760(94)90255-0 [doi]'],ppublish,J Steroid Biochem Mol Biol. 1994 Jan;48(1):95-9. doi: 10.1016/0960-0760(94)90255-0.,"['22150-76-1 (Biopterin)', '670-65-5 (Neopterin)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We therefore sought to investigate the role of Rb gene inactivation in CLL using differential polymerase chain reaction on reverse transcribed RNA. The result of the PCR was quantitated using HPLC. 5/39 patients revealed a lack or significantly impaired expression of the Rb gene upon differential PCR analysis. In addition, immunocytochemical studies were performed using the Rb-specific monoclonal antibody PMG245. 10/56 patients showed a weak or absent expression upon immunocytochemical analysis compared to monocytes or granulocytes.

The clinical and laboratory features of 55 Japanese patients with B-CLL in this study did not differ from those of Americans or Europeans with B-CLL. In the chromosome analyses, suitable metaphases with good band quality were obtained from 48 patients (87.2%), of whom 22 patients (45.8%) showed clonal chromosome aberrations and 14 (29.2%) had non-clonal aberrations. Trisomy 12 and abnormalities of 14q and 13q were found in four (18.2%), two (9.1%) and six patients (27.2%), respectively. There were no particular chromosome abnormalities or specific breakpoints in Japanese B-CLL. However, complex karyotype was found in higher incidence than in western countries. In the Southern blot analyses, rearranged band patterns were observed in the major breakpoint region (mbr) of the bcl-2 gene in one case, in the 5'-breakpoint region (5'-bcl-2) in two, and bcl-3 in one. Of the two patients with 5'-bcl-2 rearrangements, one had a normal karyotype and the other had t(2;18)(p12;q21). The incidence of rearrangements of the bcl-1, bcl-2 and bcl-3 genes in Japanese B-CLL was similar to that in western countries. These findings suggest that the biological characteristics of B-CLL in Japan are almost the same as those in western countries, although the incidence of B-CLL in Japan is quite different; this may be related to racial differences, which seem to be an important factor in the development of B-CLL.","['Asou, H', 'Takechi, M', 'Tanaka, K', 'Tashiro, S', 'Dohy, H', 'Ohno, R', 'Kamada, N']","['Asou H', 'Takechi M', 'Tanaka K', 'Tashiro S', 'Dohy H', 'Ohno R', 'Kamada N']","['Department of Haematology, Hiroshima University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Blotting, Southern', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Japan', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics']",1993/11/01 00:00,1993/11/01 00:01,['1993/11/01 00:00'],"['1993/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1993.tb03338.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1993 Nov;85(3):492-7. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1993.tb03338.x.,['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To clarify the pathophysiologic role of PML/RAR alpha in APL patients, we examined the expression of PML/RAR alpha in haemopoietic colonies in five patients with APL by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis. By the two-step RT-PCR method, we demonstrated that PML/RAR alpha positive clones were present in progenitor cells including both CFU-GM and BFU-E in two cases. This result suggests that the translocation of PML/RAR alpha occurred in a pluripotent stem cell in some APL patients. In four patients we detected two amplified cDNA fragments of 780 and 640 bp which presumably arose by alternative splicing of the PML gene. Interestingly, of CFU-GM and BFU-E colonies examined in four patients, there were three different types of colonies: those expressing only the 780 bp fragment, those expressing only the 640 bp fragment, and those expressing both fragments. This suggests that alternative splicing was clonally determined in each colony.

After 8-10 d culture, 90-100% of the B-CLL cells were dead. Cell death and DNA fragmentation were inhibited in the presence of 0.5-5 ng/ml human recombinant interleukin-4 (IL-4) and viable monoclonal B cells could be maintained in culture up to 3 weeks. At 5 ng/ml, IL-4 reduced DNA fragmentation after a 26-30 h culture to 2.2-33.3% (mean 14.9%). IL-4 inhibited apoptosis without stimulating cell proliferation. In four patients the cells were resistant to apoptosis in vitro and they could be maintained for up to 4 weeks in culture medium alone.

Western blot analysis of cell lysates showed expression of the bcl-2 protein in all 11 B-CLL patients studied. However, during culture, bcl-2 protein levels were preserved only in patients resistant to apoptosis and were reduced in those susceptible to apoptosis. Reduction of bcl-2 protein levels was inhibited in cells cultured in the presence of IL-4.

In the present studies, we have assessed the extent of this damage by quantitative spectrofluorophotometry of small molecular weight, double-stranded DNA fragments in order to provide: (a) a more complete characterization of the interaction between ara-C and bryostatin 1, and (b) a direct comparison of the relative effects of bryostatin 1 treatment with other pharmacological manipulations known to modulate protein kinase C activity. Exposure of cells to ara-C (10(-9) to 10(-4) M; 1-24 hr) induced time- and concentration-related increases in the extent of DNA fragmentation. Treatment with bryostatin 1 (10(-11) to 10(-7) M; 1-24 hr) alone failed to induce DNA damage, but promoted substantial time- and concentration-related increases in the extent of fragmentation induced by a subsequent 6-hr exposure to ara-C. Maximal potentiation of fragmentation (e.g. 2- to 3-fold greater than that obtained with ara-C alone) was observed following a 24-hr pretreatment with 10(-8) M or 10(-7) M bryostatin 1, and correlated closely with enhanced inhibition of HL-60 cell clonogenicity. The stage-1 tumor-promoter phorbol dibutyrate potentiated the effects of ara-C in a biphasic manner, maximally augmenting the response at 2.5 x 10(-8) M, but exerting no effect at 10(-7) M, whereas the stage-2 tumor-promoter mezerein failed to augment ara-C-related DNA fragmentation at low concentrations, and antagonized ara-C action at high concentrations. In contrast, ara-C-related DNA fragmentation was attenuated or abolished either by continual preexposure to synthetic diglyceride or by pretreatment with exogenous phospholipase C at all concentrations tested. Increased DNA fragmentation was not specifically related to recruitment of cells into S-phase or enhancement of ara-C-related cellular differentiation. Finally, concentrations of bryostatin 1 that maximally potentiated ara-C-related DNA fragmentation were associated with virtually complete down-regulation of total cellular PKC activity, whereas diglyceride and phospholipase C, which suppressed the response to ara-C, moderately increased total PKC activity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Jarvis, W D', 'Povirk, L F', 'Turner, A J', 'Traylor, R S', 'Gewirtz, D A', 'Pettit, G R', 'Grant, S']","['Jarvis WD', 'Povirk LF', 'Turner AJ', 'Traylor RS', 'Gewirtz DA', 'Pettit GR', 'Grant S']","['Department of Medicine, Medical College of Virginia, Richmond 23298-0230.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/genetics', 'Bryostatins', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/pharmacology', '*DNA Damage', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Lactones/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Macrolides', 'Protein Kinase C/analysis/*drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/03/02 00:00,1994/03/02 00:01,['1994/03/02 00:00'],"['1994/03/02 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/03/02 00:01 [medline]', '1994/03/02 00:00 [entrez]']","['0006-2952(94)90484-7 [pii]', '10.1016/0006-2952(94)90484-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1994 Mar 2;47(5):839-52. doi: 10.1016/0006-2952(94)90484-7.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Bryostatins)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Lactones)', '0 (Macrolides)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '37O2X55Y9E (bryostatin 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)']",,,,"['CA-09380/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-16059/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-40615/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The GM-kappa B sequence is recognized by NF-kappa B, which is mainly induced by PMA. The CLE0 sequence interacts with factors, related to a PMA-induced AP-1 and a PMA/A23187-induced NF-AT. We examined whether signal transducing components in T cells can activate transcription of the GM-CSF gene. Cotransfection of NF-kappa B (p50/p65)- or AP-1 (c-Jun/c-Fos)-expression vectors into Jurkat cells with a luciferase reporter containing the GM-CSF promoter did not stimulate transcription from the GM-CSF promoter. In contrast, cotransfection with a combination of NF-kappa B and AP-1 significantly augmented transcription from the GM-CSF promoter containing the GM-kappa B/GC-box and the CLE0 (AP-1/NF-AT). Expression of a constitutively active calcineurin (CN), a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase, potentiated by two fold the transcriptional activation by NF-kappa B/AP-1. Both constitutively active forms of CN and protein kinase C (PKC) synergistically activated transcription from the GM-CSF promoter.

Subsequently, it has been found in other leukaemias, B-lymphoblastoid cell lines, osteoclasts and subsets of normal lymphocytes, macrophages, and granulocytes. Recent data indicate that TRAP and porcine uteroferrin, a placental iron-transport protein, represent a single gene product. However, the intracellular role of TRAP is unknown. We used a full-length human placental TRAP cDNA probe to examine TRAP expression in human peripheral mononuclear cells (PMCs). TRAP mRNA increased 50-75-fold after 24 h in unstimulated PMC cultures. Cell-fractionation experiments indicated that monocytes were the main cell population accounting for increased TRAP mRNA transcripts, and this was confirmed by histochemical staining for TRAP enzyme activity. Because expression of other iron-binding and -transport proteins is controlled by iron availability, we examined the role of iron in regulating TRAP expression. Increase of TRAP mRNA transcripts in PMCs was inhibited by 50 microM desferrioxamine, a potent iron chelator. The 5' flanking region of the TRAP gene was cloned from a mouse genomic library. In preliminary transient transfection experiments, it was determined that the 5'-flanking region of the TRAP gene contained iron-responsive elements. Therefore, a series of stably transfected HRE H9 cell lines was developed bearing genetic constructs containing various segments of the murine TRAP 5' promoter region driving a luciferase reporter gene. Treatment of transfectants with 100 micrograms/ml iron-saturated human transferrin (FeTF) was performed to assess iron responsiveness of the constructs. Constructs containing a full-length TRAP promoter (comprising base pairs -1846 to +2) responded to FeTF with a 4-5-fold increase of luciferase activity whereas constructs containing only base pairs -363 to +2 of the TRAP promoter did not respond. Constructs containing 1240 or 881 bp of the TRAP promoter gave only a 1.5- to 2-fold increase of luciferase activity with FeTF. In all cases, increase of luciferase activity was blocked by desferrioxamine. Cells transfected with another luciferase construct driven by a simian virus 40 promoter did not show any increase of luciferase activity with FeTF. These data indicate that expression of TRAP is regulated by iron and that this regulation is exerted at the level of gene transcription. The transfection experiments also suggest that the region of the TRAP 5'-flanking sequence between base pairs -1846 and -1240 contains an iron regulatory element.","['Alcantara, O', 'Reddy, S V', 'Roodman, G D', 'Boldt, D H']","['Alcantara O', 'Reddy SV', 'Roodman GD', 'Boldt DH']","['Audie L.

DESIGN: Matched-pair analysis comparing relapse, treatment-related mortality, and leukemia-free survival in cohorts matched for disease and variables correlated with transplant outcome, with and without adjustment for graft-versus-host disease. SETTING: 163 institutions worldwide between 1978 and 1990, reporting to the International Bone Marrow Transplant Registry. PARTICIPANTS: 103 identical-twin transplants: 24 for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in first remission, 45 for acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) in first remission, and 34 for chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) in first chronic phase. Results were compared with those in 1030 concurrent HLA-identical sibling transplants matched for prognostic factors. RESULTS: Three-year probabilities of relapse after identical-twin compared with HLA-identical sibling transplants were as follows: ALL, 36% (95% CI, 17% to 55%) compared with 26% (CI, 20% to 32%); AML, 52% (CI, 37% to 67%) compared with 16% (CI, 12% to 20%); and CML, 40% (CI, 23% to 57%) compared with 7% (CI, 4% to 10%). Increased relapse risks in AML and CML persisted after adjusting for graft-versus-host disease (relative risk, 3.1 [CI, 1.9 to 5.1] and 5.5 [CI, 2.8 to 11.0], respectively). Although twins had less treatment-related mortality than HLA-identical siblings, leukemia-free survival was similar. Three-year leukemia-free survival probabilities after twin compared with HLA-identical sibling transplants were as follows: ALL, 57% (CI, 37% to 77%) compared with 58% (CI, 52% to 64%); AML, 42% (CI, 27% to 57%) compared with 55% (CI, 50% to 60%); and CML, 59% (CI, 42% to 76%) compared with 61% (CI, 56% to 66%). CONCLUSIONS: Identical-twin transplants in AML and CML are associated with increased relapse risk compared with HLA-identical sibling transplants. A similar trend was observed in ALL but was not statistically significant. Increased relapse in twin transplants is not explained by lack of graft-versus-host disease. Leukemia-free survival after twin and HLA-identical sibling transplants is similar because increased relapse in twins is offset by decreased treatment-related mortality.","['Gale, R P', 'Horowitz, M M', 'Ash, R C', 'Champlin, R E', 'Goldman, J M', 'Rimm, A A', 'Ringden, O', 'Stone, J A', 'Bortin, M M']","['Gale RP', 'Horowitz MM', 'Ash RC', 'Champlin RE', 'Goldman JM', 'Rimm AA', 'Ringden O', 'Stone JA', 'Bortin MM']","['International Bone Marrow Transplant Registry, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Ann Intern Med,Annals of internal medicine,0372351,IM,"['*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Graft vs Host Disease', 'HLA Antigens', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/mortality/*therapy', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/therapy', 'Matched-Pair Analysis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome', '*Twins, Monozygotic']",1994/04/15 00:00,1994/04/15 00:01,['1994/04/15 00:00'],"['1994/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.7326/0003-4819-120-8-199404150-00004 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Intern Med. 1994 Apr 15;120(8):646-52. doi: 10.7326/0003-4819-120-8-199404150-00004.,['0 (HLA Antigens)'],,,,['P01-CA-40053/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Staining intensity was strongest for HLA-DR; with both methods, 94 cases were classified as strong. For CD20, 67% were weak, 27% moderate, and 6% strong; the mean MESF values were 31.7, 66.4, and 177.4 x 10(3), respectively (P < .001).

The usefulness of these quantitative measurements needs further analysis in clinical trials.","['Witzig, T E', 'Li, C Y', 'Tefferi, A', 'Katzmann, J A']","['Witzig TE', 'Li CY', 'Tefferi A', 'Katzmann JA']","['Division of Internal Medicine and Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,IM,"['Antigens, CD/*analysis', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HLA-DR Antigens/*analysis', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Light Chains/*analysis', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology', 'Prospective Studies']",1994/03/01 00:00,1994/03/01 00:01,['1994/03/01 00:00'],"['1994/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/ajcp/101.3.312 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Clin Pathol. 1994 Mar;101(3):312-7. doi: 10.1093/ajcp/101.3.312.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Light Chains)']","['Am J Clin Pathol. 1995 Feb;103(2):255-6.

Interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R/CD25) positivity often indicates increased proliferative activity and activation in both T and B lymphocytes. The argyrophilic nucleolar organizer regions (AgNORs) are loops of DNA identified by a silver staining technique and have been correlated with ploidy and proliferative activity. Two distinct AgNOR counting methods have been previously shown to correlate with DNA ploidy and proliferative activity, respectively: the mean AgNOR count (mAgNOR) correlates more with ploidy, and the percentage of nuclei with > or = 5 AgNORs/nucleus (pAgNOR) reflects proliferative activity. We studied bone marrow specimens from 32 patients with B-CLL using both anti-IL-2R on the marrow aspirates and the AgNOR silver stain on marrow biopsy specimens, applying both AgNOR counts. All tumors were CD5+, CD19+, and CD19/CD20+. Sixteen tumors were IL-2R- (< 20% IL-2+ B cells), and 16 were IL-2R+ (> or = 20% IL-2R+ B-cells). No significant difference in morphology of bone marrow involvement was noted in the two groups. A male predominance was noted in the IL-2R+ group of patients (3:1). There was also a preponderance of lambda light chain expression in the IL-2R+ tumors (11/16) compared with the IL-2R- cases (5/16). Except for two cases, all tumors had mAgNOR counts within the diploid range (< 2.4). The 16 IL-2R- tumors had pAgNOR in the range of 0% to 7% (mean, 2.31 +/- 2.18 standard deviation), whereas the IL-2R+ tumors had pAgNOR ranging from 6% to 15% (mean, 10.20 +/- 2.70 standard deviation; P < .0001). This finding suggests that IL-2R+ B-CLL might represent a subgroup of tumors with higher proliferative activity.","['Mourad, W A', 'Pugh, W C', 'Huh, Y O', 'Keating, M J']","['Mourad WA', 'Pugh WC', 'Huh YO', 'Keating MJ']","['Department of Pathology, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Bone Marrow/chemistry/immunology/*pathology', 'Cell Division', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/immunology/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nucleolus Organizer Region/*ultrastructure', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/*analysis', 'Sex Distribution', 'Silver Staining']",1994/03/01 00:00,1994/03/01 00:01,['1994/03/01 00:00'],"['1994/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/ajcp/101.3.300 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Clin Pathol. 1994 Mar;101(3):300-4. doi: 10.1093/ajcp/101.3.300.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

FMC7 was studied by flow cytometry on cell samples from 192 patients with a diagnosis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or lymphoma. The leukemic cells from 16 patients were reactive with this antibody. These 16 cases were evaluated for other surface markers, morphology of cells, and clinical characteristics. Of the 16 patients, 14 had cells that strongly expressed surface immunoglobulin (SIg). This is atypical of CLL cells, which characteristically show weak expression of SIg. Eleven cases had kappa and five had lambda light chain. All patients' cells had consistently brighter CD20 expression than that of CD19. Fourteen patients had expression of CD5 on their leukemic cells. One patient had more than 55% prolymphocytes, meeting the criteria of prolymphocytic leukemia (PLL), two patients had CLL in prolymphocytic transformation (CLL/PL), and two other patients were classified as having a paraimmunoblastic variant of small lymphocytic lymphoma based on a high number of paraimmunoblasts and on the histologic features. Another nine patients had immature lymphoid cells distinct from prolymphocytes or paraimmunoblasts on morphologic study. The immature cells were variable in size, and the nuclear chromatin was less clumped than that of prolymphocytes. The histologic diagnoses in four of these cases were consistent with mantle cell lymphoma. Splenomegaly was observed in 11 patients (69%), and 11 patients had advanced Rai 3 or 4 disease. Among 10 patients treated with fludarabine, five responded to therapy. Monoclonal antibody FMC7 is useful for identifying a group of atypical variants of CLL, PLL, and other B-cell lymphomas in leukemic phase that can be easily confused with CLL.

There is an often neglected need for the many estimates resulting from such an analysis to be re-synthesized into summary statements, such as prediction of various outcomes from specified patient histories. Arjas and Erola recently proposed a framework for dynamic probabilistic causality which has calculation of such prediction statements as a central tool. We illustrate these procedures on data from a multicentre bone marrow transplantation study, with death while in remission and relapse as terminal events and recovery of the patients's platelets to a normal level and the onset of acute graft-versus-host disease as intermediate events, using Cox regression models throughout. Among the features illustrated by the resulting plots is a strong effect on death while in remission if the platelets do not recover within the first three months.","['Klein, J P', 'Keiding, N', 'Copelan, E A']","['Klein JP', 'Keiding N', 'Copelan EA']","['Department of Biostatistics, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee 53226.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Stat Med,Statistics in medicine,8215016,IM,"['Bone Marrow Transplantation/*mortality', 'Clinical Trials as Topic/*statistics & numerical data', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*mortality', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*mortality/surgery', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/mortality/surgery', 'Multicenter Studies as Topic/*statistics & numerical data', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/mortality/surgery', 'Probability', 'Regression Analysis', 'Remission Induction', 'Risk Factors', '*Survival Analysis']",1993/12/30 00:00,1993/12/30 00:01,['1993/12/30 00:00'],"['1993/12/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/12/30 00:01 [medline]', '1993/12/30 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/sim.4780122408 [doi]'],ppublish,Stat Med. 1993 Dec 30;12(24):2315-32. doi: 10.1002/sim.4780122408.,,,,,['1 R01 CA54706-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pretransplantation ""conditioning"" regimens were composed of chemotherapy and TBI in doses of 12 or 14.4 Gy. RESULTS: Of the six survivors who received TBI before age 8 years, five had osteochondromas and three had metaphyseal growth abnormalities. One also had slipped femoral capital epiphysis. Findings in the four remaining patients, who received TBI at ages 12-19 years, were less severe and less clearly related to TBI (mild scoliosis in two cases, avascular necrosis of the femoral condyles in one, and a femoral enchondroma in one). CONCLUSIONS: Skeletal abnormalities, previously recognized as sequelae of local external-beam irradiation in children, may occur in long-term survivors of BMT who have received TBI.

The new quinolones, among which ciprofloxacin may be found, seem to be effective in the prophylaxis of this complication. METHODS: Fifty consecutive episodes of neutropenia were studied in patients with AML who received prophylaxis with ciprofloxacin and these were compared with a historic control group of another 50 consecutive episodes of neutropenia in AML patients who did not receive antibiotic prophylaxis. The difference with regard to the prevalence of infection and the characteristics of the same were studied. RESULTS: Ciprofloxacin significantly decreased the number of febrile episodes following chemotherapy of induction or consolidation with respect to those who did not receive prophylaxis (68% versus 94%; p = 0.002). Likewise, the patients who received ciprofloxacin presented fewer bacteriologically documented infections (26% versus 50%; p = 0.023), bacteremias (10 versus 25, p = 0.03) and infections produced by Gram negative microorganisms (2 versus 13, p = 0.009). Ciprofloxacin led to disappearance of the infections produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Delay in the development of infection was observed in patients who received ciprofloxacin (mean: 11 days, CI: 7-15 days) with respect to those who did not receive prophylaxis (mean: 6 days, CI: 4-6 days) (p = 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Ciprofloxacin is an effective antibiotic in the prevention of infection in episodes of neutropenia after induction or consolidation chemotherapy in patients with acute myeloid leukemia. Not only does it decrease the number of febrile episodes, bacteriologically documented infections, bacteremias and infections produced by Gram negative microorganisms, but it also delays the appearance of the febrile episodes.","['Lopez, A', 'Soler, J A', 'Julia, A', 'Novo, A', 'Bueno, J']","['Lopez A', 'Soler JA', 'Julia A', 'Novo A', 'Bueno J']","[""Servicio de Hematologia, Ciutat Sanitaria i Universitaria Vall d'Hebron, Barcelona.""]",['spa'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Spain,Med Clin (Barc),Medicina clinica,0376377,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Bacterial Infections/etiology/*prevention & control', 'Ciprofloxacin/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutropenia/*chemically induced/complications']",1994/01/29 00:00,1994/01/29 00:01,['1994/01/29 00:00'],"['1994/01/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/29 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/29 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Med Clin (Barc). 1994 Jan 29;102(3):81-5.,['5E8K9I0O4U (Ciprofloxacin)'],,,,,,Profilaxis con ciprofloxacino en la neutropenia posquimioterapica de la leucemia mieloide aguda.,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Cohort study. SETTING: United States. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 6284 recipients of pituitary-derived human growth hormone distributed by the National Hormone and Pituitary Program between 1963 and 1985. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Leukemia and lymphoma. RESULTS: Three cases of leukemia occurred in 59,736 patient-years of follow-up from the start of growth hormone therapy to case ascertainment at interview; this number was not significantly higher (P = .23) than the 1.66 cases expected in the US age-, race-, and gender-matched general population. Three additional cases, found in an extended follow-up that provided 83,917 person-years of risk, yielded a minimum rate of leukemia that was significantly increased (six cases found, 2.26 expected; P = .028). The relative risk of leukemia in pituitary growth hormone recipients compared with the general population was 1.8 (90% confidence interval [CI], 0.82 to 7.5) for the defined follow-up and 2.6 (90% CI, 1.2 to 5.2) for the extended follow-up. Five of the six subjects who developed leukemia had antecedent cranial tumors (four craniopharyngioma, one astrocytoma) as the cause of growth hormone deficiency, and four had received radiotherapy. There was no increase in leukemia in patients with idiopathic growth hormone deficiency. The association of leukemia and craniopharyngioma was significant (P < .001). There was no excess of lymphoma in the cohort. CONCLUSIONS: This cohort of growth hormone recipients had a significantly increased rate of leukemia compared with the age-, race-, and gender-matched general population. However, the upper bound CI of the relative risk in our population (5.2) is well below the other estimates (7.6). Compared with the general population, our study population had more possible risk factors for leukemia (radiation, tumor) that may have contributed to the excess observed. The clustering of cases of leukemia in craniopharyngioma patients should be further evaluated.","['Fradkin, J E', 'Mills, J L', 'Schonberger, L B', 'Wysowski, D K', 'Thomson, R', 'Durako, S J', 'Robison, L L']","['Fradkin JE', 'Mills JL', 'Schonberger LB', 'Wysowski DK', 'Thomson R', 'Durako SJ', 'Robison LL']","['Division of Diabetes, Endocrinology, and Metabolic Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,JAMA,JAMA,7501160,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Cohort Studies', 'Craniopharyngioma/complications/therapy', 'Female', 'Growth Hormone/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/complications/*epidemiology', 'Lymphoma/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Pituitary Neoplasms/complications/therapy', 'Poisson Distribution', 'Risk Factors']",1993/12/15 00:00,1993/12/15 00:01,['1993/12/15 00:00'],"['1993/12/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/12/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/12/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,JAMA. 1993 Dec 15;270(23):2829-32.,['9002-72-6 (Growth Hormone)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We show that like the ATL cell lines, the TSP/HAM ones can form syncytia with a large panel of human target cells, including a variety of hematopoietic cell lines, as well as cell lines of neuroectodermal origin. None of the target cell lines tested was able to discriminate between TSP/HAM- and ATL-infected cell lines. When infected cells of TSP/HAM origin are cocultivated with cells of ATL origins, syncytia are never observed.

This cDNA clone was used to isolate an 884-bp RNK-Tryp-2 cDNA from an RNK-16 lambda-gt11 library. The open reading frame predicts a mature protein of 233 amino acids which does not have potential sites for N-linked glycosylation. The cDNA encodes a leader peptide of at least 25 amino acids. The characteristic Ile-Ile-Gly-Gly amino acids of the N-terminus, and the His, Asp, and Ser amino acids that form the catalytic triad of serine proteases, are conserved. The amino acid sequence has less than 45% identity with any other member of the serine protease family, indicating that RNK-Tryp-2 is distinct protease. Southern blot analysis suggests the existence of one or more related genes.

Endothelium (which expresses ICAM-1) was negative for ICAM-3, with the exception of vessels in some neoplastic lymphoid samples which showed variable staining for ICAM-3. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that ICAM-3 is essentially restricted to the haemopoietic system and is reciprocal in its expression to ICAM-1, in that it is present on resting cells and its level falls as a result of cell activation.","['Cordell, J L', 'Pulford, K', 'Turley, H', 'Jones, M', 'Micklem, K', 'Doussis, I A', 'Tyler, X', 'Mayne, K', 'Gatter, K C', 'Mason, D Y']","['Cordell JL', 'Pulford K', 'Turley H', 'Jones M', 'Micklem K', 'Doussis IA', 'Tyler X', 'Mayne K', 'Gatter KC', 'Mason DY']","['Nuffield Department of Pathology, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Clin Pathol,Journal of clinical pathology,0376601,IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', '*Antigens, CD', '*Antigens, Differentiation', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/*analysis/blood', 'Granulocytes/chemistry', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Leukemia/metabolism', 'Lymphocytes/chemistry', 'Lymphoma/metabolism', 'Monocytes/chemistry', 'Neoplasm Proteins/analysis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/02/01 00:00,1994/02/01 00:01,['1994/02/01 00:00'],"['1994/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/jcp.47.2.143 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Pathol. 1994 Feb;47(2):143-7. doi: 10.1136/jcp.47.2.143.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (ICAM3 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)']",,,,,,,,PMC501829,,,,,,,,,,

To determine the functional activation of eosinophils induced by Peak E, eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) release was examined. Peak E augumented the release of ECP from peripheral blood normodense eosinophils by degranulation. Proliferative analysis using the human eosinophilic leukemia cell line EoL-3 showed prominent cellular replication in the presence of Peak E. Moreover, Peak E upregulated interleukin 5 (IL-5) receptor levels on normodense eosinophils. Of particular interest, Peak E-stimulated human splenic T cells produced bioactive and immunoreactive IL-5. Marked induction of IL-5 mRNA in Peak E-stimulated T cells was also shown by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). In contrast, L-tryptophan without the contaminant showed none of these effects. Thus, these data suggest that Peak E might be involved in the pathogenesis of EMS through bimodal mechanism including IL-5 generation by T cells and potentiation of eosinophil functional activation.","['Yamaoka, K A', 'Miyasaka, N', 'Inuo, G', 'Saito, I', 'Kolb, J P', 'Fujita, K', 'Kashiwazaki, S']","['Yamaoka KA', 'Miyasaka N', 'Inuo G', 'Saito I', 'Kolb JP', 'Fujita K', 'Kashiwazaki S']","['U365-Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (INSERM), Interferons et Cytokines, Institut Curie, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,J Clin Immunol,Journal of clinical immunology,8102137,IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Base Sequence', 'Blood Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Electrophoresis, Agar Gel', 'Eosinophil Granule Proteins', 'Eosinophilia-Myalgia Syndrome/*etiology', 'Eosinophils/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-5/*biosynthesis', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin/metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin-5', '*Ribonucleases', 'Spleen/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Tryptophan/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives/*immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF01541175 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Immunol. 1994 Jan;14(1):50-60. doi: 10.1007/BF01541175.,"['0 (Blood Proteins)', '0 (Eosinophil Granule Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-5)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-5)', ""132685-02-0 (1,1'-ethylidene bis(tryptophan))"", '8DUH1N11BX (Tryptophan)', 'EC 3.1.- (Ribonucleases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purification procedure included ammonium sulfate precipitation and sequential column chromatography on octyl-Sepharose, ATP-agarose, Mono Q fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC), and hydroxyapatite FPLC. The resulting enzyme preparation was purified over 400,000-fold with a final specific activity of approximately 5 mumol/min/mg using a mixed micelle assay system of Triton X-100 and dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine (PC). The purified enzyme was Ca(2+)-independent and did not show a preference for either sn-2 arachidonic acid or sn-1 alkyl-ether containing phospholipids when utilizing mixed micelles as substrate. It was found to hydrolyze dipalmitoyl-PC approximately 4-fold faster than 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonyl-PC and approximately 15-fold faster than 1-O-hexadecyl-2-arachidonyl-PC. Triton X-100 increased the P388D1 iPLA2 activity with optimal activity found at a Triton/phospholipid molar ratio of 4:1. The purified enzyme was activated 2-6-fold by ATP as well as other di- and triphosphate nucleosides. This activation was sensitive to the concentration of Triton X-100 present in the assay. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis carried out on the purified enzyme yielded a single major band at a molecular weight of about 80,000. However, radiation inactivation experiments, carried out on the cell homogenate, demonstrated a target size of 337 +/- 25 kDa, indicating that the catalytically active iPLA2 exists as a large oligomeric complex, either through self-aggregation or association of the enzyme with other proteins.","['Ackermann, E J', 'Kempner, E S', 'Dennis, E A']","['Ackermann EJ', 'Kempner ES', 'Dennis EA']","['Department of Chemistry, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla 92093-0601.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/chemistry', 'Animals', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cytosol/enzymology', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Leukemia P388/*enzymology', 'Macrophages/*enzymology', 'Microsomes/enzymology', 'Molecular Weight', 'Octoxynol/chemistry', 'Phospholipases A/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Phospholipases A2', 'Substrate Specificity']",1994/03/25 00:00,1994/03/25 00:01,['1994/03/25 00:00'],"['1994/03/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/03/25 00:01 [medline]', '1994/03/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(17)37098-9 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1994 Mar 25;269(12):9227-33.,"['8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', '9002-93-1 (Octoxynol)', 'EC 3.1.1.32 (Phospholipases A)', 'EC 3.1.1.4 (Phospholipases A2)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,,,['HD 26171/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At the same concentrations, these agents induced a strong suppression of c-myb mRNA levels within 3 h, whereas c-myc expression remained unaffected. The c-myb expression recovered and approached pretreatment levels at 9-12 h of incubation. The decrease in c-myb mRNA was prevented in Ca(2+)-free medium. Treatment of F4-6 cells with EGTA led to a transient increase in c-myb mRNA with the same kinetics as the Ca2+ pump inhibitor-induced suppression, indicating that c-myb expression is bidirectionally regulated by changes in [Ca2+]i. Studies on the differentiation status of F4-6 cells following cyclopiazonic acid or thapsigargin exposure demonstrated a marked increase in beta-globin mRNA synthesis at 60h and in hemoglobin production at 96 h.

We have cloned and characterized a pair of partially duplicated genes, RP1 and RP2, located 611 base pairs upstream of the human C4A and C4B genes, respectively. The putative RP protein, consisting of 364 amino acid residues, is basic and highly hydrophilic. There is a bipartite nuclear localization signal at residues 114-131 and therefore RP may be a nuclear protein. Northern blot analysis suggested that RP is ubiquitously expressed. The 5' region of the RP1 gene is CpG rich, which is a characteristic of housekeeping genes. The RP1 gene contains nine exons. Located in the fourth intron is a cluster of Alu elements, and a newly defined composite retroposon SVA with a SINE, multiple copies of GC-rich VNTRs and an Alu element altogether enclosed by direct terminal repeats. Members of SVA are also present in the complement C2 gene located about 20 kilobases upstream of RP1 in the HLA and in the cytochrome CYP1A1 gene. Determination of the DNA sequences for RP2 from two different HLA haplotypes revealed identical hybrid sequences which resulted from fusion of RP with the tenascin-like Gene X and truncation of the 5' regions of both genes. Cumulative data suggest that the four tandemly arranged genes RP, complement C4, steroid 21-hydroxylase (CYP21), and Gene X altogether form a modular structure, RCCX. The number of RCCX modules varies from one to three or more in the population. Absence of the truncated genes RP2 and Gene XA have been detected in genomes with single RCCX modules. Duplication of the RCCX modules probably occurred before the speciation of great apes and humans as they contain the same breakpoint region of RP and Gene X gene duplication.","['Shen, L', 'Wu, L C', 'Sanlioglu, S', 'Chen, R', 'Mendoza, A R', 'Dangel, A W', 'Carroll, M C', 'Zipf, W B', 'Yu, C Y']","['Shen L', 'Wu LC', 'Sanlioglu S', 'Chen R', 'Mendoza AR', 'Dangel AW', 'Carroll MC', 'Zipf WB', 'Yu CY']","[""Children's Hospital Research Foundation, Columbus, Ohio 43205.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Alleles', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Colonic Neoplasms', 'Complement C4a/*genetics', 'Complement C4b/*genetics', 'DNA Primers', '*Exons', 'HLA Antigens/*genetics', 'Humans', '*Introns', 'Leukemia, T-Cell', '*Major Histocompatibility Complex', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Multigene Family', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Primates', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Steroid 21-Hydroxylase/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/03/18 00:00,1994/03/18 00:01,['1994/03/18 00:00'],"['1994/03/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/03/18 00:01 [medline]', '1994/03/18 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(17)37217-4 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1994 Mar 18;269(11):8466-76.,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '80295-49-4 (Complement C4a)', '80295-50-7 (Complement C4b)', 'EC 1.14.14.16 (Steroid 21-Hydroxylase)']",,,,,"['CYP1A1', 'RP', 'RP1', 'RP2']",,"['GENBANK/L26260', 'GENBANK/L26261', 'GENBANK/L26262', 'GENBANK/L26263', 'GENBANK/Z48796']",,,,,,,,,,,

TNF-alpha readily stimulated NF-kappa B activity in both cell lines as assayed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay and the use of a human immunodeficiency virus-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter construct. However, TNF-alpha stimulation did not increase cell ceramide levels in either cell line. The exogenous addition of a short chain ceramide, N-acetylsphingosine, to Jurkat cells had no effect on NF-kappa B activity. When Jurkat T cells were exposed to the glucosylceramide synthase inhibitor, 1-phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol, endogenous ceramide levels increased 4-fold. The increase in ceramide, however, did not result in NF-kappa B activation nor did it potentiate TNF-alpha or phorbol ester-stimulated activity. We conclude that TNF-alpha-induced NF-kappa B activation occurs in Jurkat and HL-60 cell lines that do not demonstrate an increase in TNF-alpha-induced ceramide. Increasing ceramide levels by the addition of short chain ceramides or the use of a glucosylceramide synthase inhibitor can be dissociated from activation of NF-kappa B by TNF-alpha.","['Betts, J C', 'Agranoff, A B', 'Nabel, G J', 'Shayman, J A']","['Betts JC', 'Agranoff AB', 'Nabel GJ', 'Shayman JA']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor 48109-0676.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Ceramides/*metabolism', 'Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Genetic Vectors', 'HIV', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Leukemia, T-Cell', 'Morpholines/pharmacology', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Time Factors', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*pharmacology']",1994/03/18 00:00,1994/03/18 00:01,['1994/03/18 00:00'],"['1994/03/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/03/18 00:01 [medline]', '1994/03/18 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(17)37215-0 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1994 Mar 18;269(11):8455-8.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Ceramides)', '0 (Morpholines)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '73257-80-4 (RV 538)', 'EC 2.3.1.28 (Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,,"['AI 29179/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'DK41487/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tissue specificity and cell line artifact.,8287-95,"In order to gain further insights of the regulatory mechanisms of human beta-like globin gene switch during erythroid development, we have studied protein-DNA interaction in vivo at the human adult beta and fetal gamma globin promoters and their upstream enhancer, 5'HS-2, in purified human adult erythroblasts, in which the beta, but not gamma or epsilon, globin gene is actively transcribing. This genomic footprinting analysis of adult erythroblasts was carried out in conjunction with those of different non-erythroid human tissues, an embryonic/fetal erythroid cell line K562, and several non-erythroid human cell lines. Protein-DNA binding in the beta globin promoter, in particular at the two CACC promoter boxes and the CCAAT box, is detectable only in the adult erythroblasts. As expected, the gamma globin promoters were bound with specific nuclear factors in the expressing K562 cells, but not in non-erythroid tissues or cell lines. Relatively weak protein binding could also be detected in the vicinities of the two CCAAT boxes of the inactive gamma globin promoters in the adult erythroblasts. Although the patterns of nuclear factor-DNA interaction in vivo at the NF-E2/AP1, GATA-1, and GT-I motifs of 5'HS-2 enhancer in adult erythroblasts are similar to those in K562 cells, we have identified a previously undetected factor-binding motif of 5'HS-2 that is protected only in the adult erythroblasts. This motif is identical in sequence to the 3'-CACC box of the human beta globin promoter, and it is well conserved at the same location among all mammalian 5'HS-2 enhancers, suggesting an important regulatory role of this element in human beta globin gene transcription in adult erythroblasts. All of the above four motifs of 5'HS-2 are free of nuclear factor binding in non-erythroid tissues, but two of them, NF-E2/AP1 and GT-I, are bound with factors in some non-erythroid cell lines but not in others. The functional implications of these genomic footprinting data and the tissue-specific CpG methylation patterns of the beta-like globin promoters we obtained by genomic sequencing are discussed in terms of positive and negative regulation of the human beta-like globin switch during erythroid development.","['Reddy, P M', 'Stamatoyannopoulos, G', 'Papayannopoulou, T', 'Shen, C K']","['Reddy PM', 'Stamatoyannopoulos G', 'Papayannopoulou T', 'Shen CK']","['Section of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California, Davis 95616.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', '*Artifacts', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Conserved Sequence', 'DNA/genetics/*metabolism', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Erythroblasts/*metabolism', 'Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors', 'Fetus', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor', '*Genome, Human', 'Globins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'HeLa Cells', 'Hominidae/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive', 'Mammals', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'NF-E2 Transcription Factor', 'NF-E2 Transcription Factor, p45 Subunit', 'Organ Specificity', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', '*Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/03/18 00:00,1994/03/18 00:01,['1994/03/18 00:00'],"['1994/03/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/03/18 00:01 [medline]', '1994/03/18 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(17)37191-0 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1994 Mar 18;269(11):8287-95.,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors)', '0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA1 protein, human)', '0 (NF-E2 Transcription Factor)', '0 (NF-E2 Transcription Factor, p45 Subunit)', '0 (NFE2 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",,,,"['DK 45365/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK29800/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'HL 20899/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Evidence that it is the human erythrocyte chemokine receptor.,7835-8,"The human malarial parasite Plasmodium vivax invades erythrocytes by binding to a cell surface protein identified as the Duffy blood group antigen. The molecular properties of the Duffy antigen, which was recently cloned, are very similar to those of a chemokine binding protein known as the human erythrocyte chemokine receptor. This has led to the suggestion that these two molecules are the same protein. To further investigate the suspected double identity of the Duffy antigen we have transfected it into a human erythroleukemic cell line, K562. Cells stably expressing the Duffy antigen were isolated and used to characterize the protein. K562 cells transfected with the Duffy antigen displayed specific 125I-melanoma growth-stimulating activity (MGSA) binding while mock transfected cells did not. Comparison of 125I-MGSA binding to the Duffy antigen and the human erythrocyte chemokine receptor showed that the specific 125I-MGSA binding to both proteins was displaced by excess unlabeled MGSA, interleukin-8, RANTES, monocyte chemotactic peptide-1, and platelet factor 4, but not by macrophage inflammatory protein-1 alpha or -1 beta. Scatchard analysis of competition binding studies with these unlabeled chemokines revealed high affinity binding to the Duffy antigen with KD binding values of 24 +/- 4.9, 20 +/- 4.7, 41.9 +/- 12.8, and 33.9 +/- 7 nM for MGSA, interleukin-8, RANTES, and monocyte chemotactic peptide-1, respectively. A monoclonal antibody, Fy6, to the Duffy antigen inhibited 125I-MGSA binding to K562 cells expressing the Duffy antigen. Cell membranes from K562 cells permanently expressing the Duffy antigen were chemically cross-linked with 125I-MGSA. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of the cross-linked products showed covalent incorporation of radiolabeled MGSA into a protein of molecular mass 47 kDa, and cross-linking was inhibited in the presence of unlabeled MGSA. These studies provide evidence that the Duffy blood group antigen is the same protein as the human erythrocyte chemokine receptor.","['Chaudhuri, A', 'Zbrzezna, V', 'Polyakova, J', 'Pogo, A O', 'Hesselgesser, J', 'Horuk, R']","['Chaudhuri A', 'Zbrzezna V', 'Polyakova J', 'Pogo AO', 'Hesselgesser J', 'Horuk R']","['New York Blood Center, New York 10021.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Chemokine CXCL1', '*Chemokines, CXC', 'Chemotactic Factors/*metabolism', 'Duffy Blood-Group System/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Erythrocytes/*metabolism', 'Growth Substances/*metabolism', 'Humans', '*Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Plasmids', 'Receptors, Cytokine/biosynthesis/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/03/18 00:00,1994/03/18 00:01,['1994/03/18 00:00'],"['1994/03/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/03/18 00:01 [medline]', '1994/03/18 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(17)37123-5 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1994 Mar 18;269(11):7835-8.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (CXCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL1)', '0 (Chemokines, CXC)', '0 (Chemotactic Factors)', '0 (Duffy Blood-Group System)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (melanoma growth stimulating activity receptor)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

KU812 cells express affinity receptors for IgE, produce histamine and tryptase and have the capacity for IgE-mediated histamine release. In this study we have examined the cytokines, produced by the Mo cell line, which are responsible for the observed differentiation-inducing effect in the KU812 cell line. It was shown that interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) induced differentiation in the KU812 cells and that these cytokines were responsible for the differentiation-inducing effect of the Mo supernatant. Other cytokines tested, IL-1 beta, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-8, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and nerve growth factor (NGF) were without effect on the KU812 cells. KU812 was also shown to express receptors for both TNF-alpha and IL-6 after 3 days cultivation with conditioned media from the Mo T-cell line. Untreated cells showed no detectable levels of TNF-alpha or IL-6 receptors indicating induction of these receptors during differentiation. Spontaneous differentiation was shown to occur under serum-free conditions which may be the result of endogenous IL-6 production through an autocrine loop. The activity of TNF-alpha and IL-6 could be blocked by specific monoclonal antibodies (mAb) to the respective cytokine.","['Nilsson, G', 'Carlsson, M', 'Jones, I', 'Ahlstedt, S', 'Matsson, P', 'Nilsson, K']","['Nilsson G', 'Carlsson M', 'Jones I', 'Ahlstedt S', 'Matsson P', 'Nilsson K']","['Department of Pathology, University of Uppsala, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Immunology,Immunology,0374672,IM,"['Basophils/*cytology', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Culture Media', 'Histamine/biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/analysis/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/immunology', 'Receptors, Interleukin/analysis', 'Receptors, Interleukin-6', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/analysis', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/analysis/*pharmacology']",1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Immunology. 1994 Jan;81(1):73-8.,"['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-6)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '820484N8I3 (Histamine)']",,,,,,,,PMC1422293,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, the effects of recombinant mouse interleukin-4 (IL-4), either alone or in combination with mouse TNF-alpha, on the growth and differentiation of JCS cells were examined. IL-4 alone (20-5000 U/ml) inhibited the growth of JCS cells in a dose-dependent manner but did not induce cell differentiation. However, combinations of IL-4 and TNF-alpha acted in synergy to inhibit cell proliferation and induce monocytic differentiation of JCS cells, as shown by increased expression of the macrophage differentiation antigens (F4/80, Mac-1), stimulation of phagocytic activity, induction of non-specific esterase and NBT-reducing activities, increased plastic adherence and morphological criteria. Similar synergistic interactions were also shown by human TNF-alpha and mouse IL-4, indicating that TNF-alpha might exert its effects through the low-affinity (p55) TNF receptors. Moreover, the clonogenicity of JCS cells in vitro and their tumorigenicity in vivo were significantly reduced by combined TNF-alpha and IL-4 treatment. Our results indicate that TNF-alpha can act as a differential signal for JCS cells and that its effects are modulated by IL-4. Therefore, the combination of TNF-alpha and IL-4 may be useful in the treatment of some forms of myelomonocytic leukaemia.","['Leung, K N', 'Mak, N K', 'Fung, M C', 'Hapel, A J']","['Leung KN', 'Mak NK', 'Fung MC', 'Hapel AJ']","['Experimental Haematology Group, John Curtin School of Medical Research, Australian National University, Canberra.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Immunology,Immunology,0374672,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'Interleukin-4/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/immunology/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Monocytes/*cytology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*pharmacology']",1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Immunology. 1994 Jan;81(1):65-72.,"['0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)']",,,,,,,,PMC1422298,,,,,,,,,,

We have cloned a human cDNA, designated Stch, that is conserved in rat tissues and which encodes a novel microsome-associated member of the stress70 protein chaperone family. Stch mRNA is constitutively expressed in all human cell types and is induced by incubation with the calcium ionophore A23187, but not by exposure to heat shock. Inspection of the predicted amino acid sequence reveals that the STCH product contains a unique hydrophobic leader sequence and shares homology within the amino terminal domains of the stress70 gene family, but has a 50 residue insertion within the ATP-binding domains and truncates the carboxyl terminal peptide-binding region. Immunofluorescent and subcellular analyses show that STCH migrates predominantly as a 60 kDa species and is enriched in a membrane-bound microsome fraction. In contrast to purified BiP and dnaK, however, STCH demonstrates ATPase activity that is independent of peptide stimulation.

Here we show that PML, a protein involved in the t(15;17) translocation of acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL), is specifically bound to a NB. PML and several NB-associated proteins, found as auto-antigens in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), are co-localized and co-regulated. The APL-derived PML-RAR alpha fusion protein is shown to be predominantly localized in the cytoplasm, whereas a fraction is nuclear and delocalizes the NB antigens to multiple smaller nuclear clusters devoid of ultrastructural organization. RA administration (which in APL patients induces blast differentiation and consequently complete remissions) causes the re-aggregation of PML and PBC auto-antigens onto the NB, while PML-RAR alpha remains mainly cytoplasmic. Thus, PML-RAR alpha expression leads to a RA-reversible alteration of a nuclear domain. These results shed a new light on the pathogenesis of APL and provide a molecular link between NBs and oncogenesis.","['Koken, M H', 'Puvion-Dutilleul, F', 'Guillemin, M C', 'Viron, A', 'Linares-Cruz, G', 'Stuurman, N', 'de Jong, L', 'Szostecki, C', 'Calvo, F', 'Chomienne, C']","['Koken MH', 'Puvion-Dutilleul F', 'Guillemin MC', 'Viron A', 'Linares-Cruz G', 'Stuurman N', 'de Jong L', 'Szostecki C', 'Calvo F', 'Chomienne C', 'et al.']","['CNRS UPR 43, Centre Hayem, Hopital St Louis, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,IM,"['Animals', 'CHO Cells', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 15', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17', 'Cricetinae', 'Cytoplasmic Granules/drug effects/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*genetics', 'Microscopy, Immunoelectron', '*Neoplasm Proteins', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/analysis/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/analysis/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/analysis/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Transfection', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",1994/03/01 00:00,1994/03/01 00:01,['1994/03/01 00:00'],"['1994/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,EMBO J. 1994 Mar 1;13(5):1073-83.,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",,,,,,,,PMC394915,,,,,,,,,,

Methyl alpha-D-mannopyranoside and methyl beta-D-galactopyranoside were added to serum samples as internal standards and, after sequential extraction of lipids and proteins with chloroform and acetonitrile, respectively, samples were acetylated with acetic anhydride and 4-dimethylaminopyridine and separated by gas-liquid chromatography. The identity of swainsonine and the internal standards after their extraction from serum and acetylation was confirmed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Swainsonine was recovered at an efficiency of 90%, relative to internal standards, and calibration graphs were rectilinear from 3 to 18 mg/L with a detection limit of approximately 0.1 mg/L.

Inherited XIII deficiency results in a life-long, severe bleeding diathesis which, if untreated, carries a very high risk of death in early life from intracranial bleeding. XIII is a zymogen requiring thrombin and calcium for activation. In plasma, XIII has two subunits: the 'a' subunit, which is the active enzyme, and the 'b' subunit which is a carrier protein. Activated XIII modifies the structure of clot by covalently crosslinking fibrin through an epsilon (gamma-glutamyl)lysine link. It also crosslinks other proteins, including fibronectin and alpha-2-plasmin inhibitor (alpha-2PI), into the clot through the same link. Clot modified by XIII is physically stronger, relatively more resistant to fibrinolysis and may be a more suitable medium for the ingrowth of fibroblasts. Inheritance of factor XIII is autosomal recessive. The majority of patients with the inherited defect show no XIII activity and absence of 'a' subunit protein in plasma, platelets and monocytes. At the molecular level, the defect is not a major gene rearrangement or deletion, but most likely a single point mutation which may be different in each family. Because of the severity of the bleeding diathesis, prophylaxis is desirable and has been shown to be very effective as the in vivo half-life of plasma XIII is long, and low plasma levels are sufficient for haemostasis. Acquired inhibitors have been reported in only two cases with inherited XIII deficiency. Acquired XIII deficiency has been described in a variety of diseases and bleeding has been controlled by therapy with large doses of XIII in such conditions as Henoch-Schonlein purpura, various forms of colitis, erosive gastritis and some forms of leukaemia. Large dose XIII therapy has also been used in an endeavour to promote wound healing after surgery and bone union in non-healing fractures. The use of XIII in these conditions remains controversial. Very rarely a bleeding diathesis results from the development of a specific inhibitor to XIII arising de novo, often as a complication in the course of a disease or in association with long-term drug therapy. The bleeding diathesis in these patients is difficult to treat.","['Board, P G', 'Losowsky, M S', 'Miloszewski, K J']","['Board PG', 'Losowsky MS', 'Miloszewski KJ']","['John Curtin School of Medical Research, Australian National University, Canberra.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Blood Rev,Blood reviews,8708558,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Factor XIII/chemistry/genetics/physiology', '*Factor XIII Deficiency/diagnosis/genetics/therapy', 'Fibrin/metabolism', 'Hemorrhagic Disorders/etiology', 'Hemostasis', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Protein Conformation', 'Wound Healing']",1993/12/01 00:00,1993/12/01 00:01,['1993/12/01 00:00'],"['1993/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0268-960X(93)90010-2 [pii]', '10.1016/0268-960x(93)90010-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Rev. 1993 Dec;7(4):229-42. doi: 10.1016/0268-960x(93)90010-2.,"['9001-31-4 (Fibrin)', '9013-56-3 (Factor XIII)']",,185,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A number of studies, both randomized and historical, have demonstrated that empiric therapy with amphotericin B in neutropenic patients with fever, refractory to antibiotics, results in a decrease in the frequency and mortality of deep fungal infections. Recent years have seen a number of advances in the management of neutropenic patients. Reasonably effective antifungal prophylaxis now exists and in many centres forms part of the routine care of neutropenic patients. Other centres advocate the use of selective decontamination and/or protective isolation. Furthermore the duration of neutropenia can be reduced with the use of haematopoetic growth factors. The impact of empiric amphotericin B in patients already benefiting from such treatments has not been adequately studied. The optimum dose of empiric amphotericin B is not defined. The criteria for commencing amphotericin B therapy in febrile neutropenic patients must therefore be redefined on the basis of further studies carried out in the context of these developments.

Cardiac neural crest cells are derived from the neural folds located between the mid-otic placodes and the caudal limit of somite 3. These crest cells can differentiate into a variety of mesenchymal cell types that support cardiovascular development, in addition to neurogenic cells. When cultured, many express alpha-smooth muscle actin or neurofilaments and lose their undifferentiated neural crest phenotype as shown by a decrease in HNK-1 reactivity. We wanted to determine whether cultured cardiac neural crest cells maintained the potency to support normal heart development when backtransplanted into embryos lacking their native cardiac neural crest. Under usual circumstances removal of the cardiac neural crest results in 80-100% incidence of persistent truncus arteriosus. The present study reports a system in which cardiac neural folds are cultured for 3 days and the cells backtransplanted into chick embryos after laser-induced ablation of the intrinsic cardiac neural folds. Rescue of heart development was improved 50% when cultured cells were backtransplanted and almost 200% when the backtransplanted cells had been cultured in leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). To determine whether the cultured cells are capable of following normal migratory routes, cultured homospecific cardiac neural crest cells were tagged with DiI. Initially, fluorescent cells were found concentrated around the neural tube. By the second day following backtransplantation, the cells had migrated to the circumpharyngeal crest, populated the pharyngeal arches and aortic arch arteries, and were in the region of the cardiac outflow tract. By the third day, the labeled cells had dispersed, but could be found around the neural tube, esophagus, cardiac outflow tract, and within the dorsal root ganglia. Interestingly, a cranial migration to the periphery of the eyes was also noted. With the exception of the cranial migration to the eyes, cultured and backtransplanted cardiac neural crest cells followed normal migratory pathways to the cardiac outflow tract. LIF is used for the in vitro maintenance of the pluripotential phenotype of embryonic stem cells. In an effort to understand why LIF improves the ability of cultured neural crest cells to support normal heart development, we have examined the relationship of neural crest expression of HNK-1 antigen, alpha-smooth muscle actin, and neurofilament protein in neural crest cells cultured in LIF. LIF treatment resulted in an expanded period of expression of HNK-1 antigen, associated with a decrease in expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Kirby, M L', 'Kumiski, D H', 'Myers, T', 'Cerjan, C', 'Mishima, N']","['Kirby ML', 'Kumiski DH', 'Myers T', 'Cerjan C', 'Mishima N']","['Department of Cellular Biology and Anatomy, Medical College of Georgia, Augusta 30912-2000.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Dev Dyn,Developmental dynamics : an official publication of the American Association of Anatomists,9201927,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Movement', '*Cell Transplantation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chick Embryo', 'Embryonic and Fetal Development', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Heart/*embryology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*pharmacology', 'Neural Crest/*cytology/drug effects', 'Osmolar Concentration']",1993/12/01 00:00,1993/12/01 00:01,['1993/12/01 00:00'],"['1993/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/aja.1001980407 [doi]'],ppublish,Dev Dyn. 1993 Dec;198(4):296-311. doi: 10.1002/aja.1001980407.,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)']",,,,['HL36059/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cellular swelling was initiated with hyperosmotic pipette solutions. Simultaneous evaluation of V/Vo and gCl revealed a 59-s delay between the inception of swelling and the activation of outwardly rectifying, ATP-dependent Cl- channels. Following the delay, increases in V/Vo and gCl progressed in parallel. In contrast, Cm, a measure of cell surface area, fell gradually at a rate of approximately 150 fF/min after whole-cell access was achieved. The decline in Cm lasted 200 s and was followed by a rapid rise (approximately 750 fF/min). The rise in Cm coincided with a variable increase in ""leak"" current, gCl increased at a slower rate and reached lower peak values in experiments performed without ATP; ATP had no effect on the biphasic Cm time course. The temporal separation of conductance and capacitance during swelling suggests that gCl and Cm vary independently, supporting the hypothesis that a large portion, if not all, of the whole-cell Cl- conductance activated during swelling is provided by volume-sensitive Cl- channels preexisting in the plasma membrane.","['Ross, P E', 'Garber, S S', 'Cahalan, M D']","['Ross PE', 'Garber SS', 'Cahalan MD']","['Department of Physiology and Biophysics, University of California, Irvine 92717.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biophys J,Biophysical journal,0370626,IM,"['Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/physiology', 'Chloride Channels/*physiology', 'Chlorides/*metabolism', 'Electric Conductivity', 'Electrophysiology/methods', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, T-Cell', 'Mathematics', 'Models, Biological', 'Osmolar Concentration', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/*physiology', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-3495(94)80754-4 [pii]', '10.1016/S0006-3495(94)80754-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Biophys J. 1994 Jan;66(1):169-78. doi: 10.1016/S0006-3495(94)80754-4.,"['0 (Chloride Channels)', '0 (Chlorides)']",,,,['NS14609/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,PMC1275677,,,,,,,,,,

The fractions in Percoll had densities that ranged between 1.040 and 1.060 g/dl. In as early as 5 min, two fractions, densities of 1.051 and 1.056, respectively, were discernible. Components in the 1.051 fraction tested positive for clathrin and catalase. Those in the 1.056 fraction sedimented near the marker for lysosomes. The 67Cu in both fractions was stable to treatment by EDTA, nitrilotriacetate, alpha,alpha'-dipyridyl, heparinase, and ascorbate, but dissociated when treated with pronase, trypsin, or sodium dodecylsulfate. Continuous incubation with 67Cu-ceruloplasmin intensified the 67Cu activity in the 1.051 and 1.056 fractions. Cells incubated with 125I-transferrin displayed the label primarily in the 1.051 fraction. Continuous incubation intensified the label but unlike 67Cu, it did not shift to lighter or heavier fractions. Electron micrographs of the 1.051 fraction showed fields dominated by membranous structures some of which were enclosed. Micrographs of whole cells showed numerous invaginations resembling coated pits with sealed structures along and beneath the membrane surface suggesting the membrane was engaged in a rather extensive endocytosis. These data provide evidence that a large fraction of Cu from ceruloplasmin enters the K562 cell bound to membranous-like vesicles, part of which are sealed and coated with clathrin. This particulate pathway accounts for most of the copper entering the cell.","['Davidson, L A', 'McOrmond, S L', 'Harris, E D']","['Davidson LA', 'McOrmond SL', 'Harris ED']","['Graduate Faculty of Nutrition, Kleberg Center, Texas A&M University, College Station 77843-2174.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,IM,"[""2,2'-Dipyridyl/pharmacology"", 'Ascorbic Acid/pharmacology', 'Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Cell Fractionation', 'Cell Line', 'Centrifugation, Density Gradient', 'Ceruloplasmin/*metabolism', 'Copper/*metabolism', 'Copper Radioisotopes', 'Edetic Acid/pharmacology', 'Heparin Lyase', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Nitrilotriacetic Acid/pharmacology', 'Polysaccharide-Lyases/pharmacology', 'Subcellular Fractions/drug effects/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/03/10 00:00,1994/03/10 00:01,['1994/03/10 00:00'],"['1994/03/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/03/10 00:01 [medline]', '1994/03/10 00:00 [entrez]']","['0167-4889(94)90208-9 [pii]', '10.1016/0167-4889(94)90208-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1994 Mar 10;1221(1):1-6. doi: 10.1016/0167-4889(94)90208-9.,"['0 (Copper Radioisotopes)', ""551W113ZEP (2,2'-Dipyridyl)"", '789U1901C5 (Copper)', '9G34HU7RV0 (Edetic Acid)', 'EC 1.16.3.1 (Ceruloplasmin)', 'EC 4.2.2.- (Polysaccharide-Lyases)', 'EC 4.2.2.7 (Heparin Lyase)', 'KA90006V9D (Nitrilotriacetic Acid)', 'PQ6CK8PD0R (Ascorbic Acid)']",,,,['DK41682/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When protein kinase C was down-regulated by phorbol myristate acetate (1 microM for 3-6 h) or inhibited by pharmacological agents such as calphostin C (1 microM) or a protein kinase C-specific pseudo-substrate peptide inhibitor (100-200 microM), cells lost the ability to secrete in response to 10 microM free Ca2+. In contrast, a short treatment (15 min) with phorbol myristate acetate, which maximally activates protein kinase C, potentiated the effects of calcium. Biochemical analysis of protein kinase C-deprived cells indicated that loss of the Ca(2+)-induced secretory response correlated with disappearance of protein kinase C-alpha. In addition, at the concentrations effective for exocytosis, calcium caused translocation of protein kinase C-alpha to the membrane fraction and stimulated phospholipase C, suggesting that, in permeabilized cells, protein kinase C can be activated by calcium through generation of the phospholipase C metabolite diacylglycerol. The delta, epsilon and zeta Ca(2+)-independent protein kinase C isoenzymes were insensitive to phorbol myristate acetate-induced down-regulation and did not, as expected, translocate to the particulate fraction in response to calcium. Interestingly, secretory competence was restored in cells depleted of protein kinase C or in which protein kinase C itself was inhibited by non-hydrolysable GTP analogues, but not by GTP, suggesting that protein kinase C might regulate the ability of a G protein(s) directly controlling the exocytotic machinery to be activated by endogenous GTP.","['Buccione, R', 'Di Tullio, G', 'Caretta, M', 'Marinetti, M R', 'Bizzarri, C', 'Francavilla, S', 'Luini, A', 'De Matteis, M A']","['Buccione R', 'Di Tullio G', 'Caretta M', 'Marinetti MR', 'Bizzarri C', 'Francavilla S', 'Luini A', 'De Matteis MA']","['Laboratory of Molecular Neurobiology, Istituto di Ricerche Farmacologiche Mario Negri, Consorzio Mario Negri Sud, S.

Retinal complications.,372-9,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the posterior segment ocular complications of patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation (BMT). DESIGN: Retrospective analysis. SETTING: Academic ophthalmology department at a tertiary care hospital with a BMT unit. PATIENTS: Patients undergoing BMT were seen by an ophthalmologist for clinical care and enrolled in a long-term follow-up study, during which they were seen 6 and 12 months after the transplantation and annually thereafter. RESULTS: Of 397 patients undergoing BMT, 51 (12.8%) developed posterior segment complications. Fourteen patients (3.5%) developed hemorrhagic complications with either intraretinal and/or vitreous hemorrhages and 17 patients (4.3%) developed cotton-wool spots in the fundus of both eyes. Eleven patients (2.8%) had bilateral optic disc edema, with eight cases attributed to the toxic effects of cyclosporine and three to other causes. Two patients (0.5%) developed serious retinal detachments. Eight patients (2.0%) developed infectious retinitis and/or endophthalmitis. Fungal infections with Candida or Aspergillus usually occurred within 120 days after BMT, while viral infections with herpes zoster or cytomegalovirus and parasitic infections with Toxoplasma occurred later. Intraocular lymphoma occurred in one patient (0.2%). CONCLUSION: Severe, potentially vision-threatening, posterior segment complications following BMT occur due to a variety of causes.","['Coskuncan, N M', 'Jabs, D A', 'Dunn, J P', 'Haller, J A', 'Green, W R', 'Vogelsang, G B', 'Santos, G W']","['Coskuncan NM', 'Jabs DA', 'Dunn JP', 'Haller JA', 'Green WR', 'Vogelsang GB', 'Santos GW']","['Wilmer Ophthalmological Institute, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Arch Ophthalmol,"Archives of ophthalmology (Chicago, Ill. : 1960)",7706534,IM,"['Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Endophthalmitis/etiology', 'Eye Infections/etiology/pathology', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Fundus Oculi', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Lymphoma/etiology/pathology', 'Male', 'Retinal Diseases/*etiology/pathology', 'Retrospective Studies']",1994/03/01 00:00,1994/03/01 00:01,['1994/03/01 00:00'],"['1994/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1001/archopht.1994.01090150102031 [doi]'],ppublish,Arch Ophthalmol. 1994 Mar;112(3):372-9. doi: 10.1001/archopht.1994.01090150102031.,,,,,"['EY01765/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States', 'EY07047/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA15396/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Accordingly, the risk of MRSA infection is very high in these patients, and the infection is often fatal. In an attempt to establish effective measures to prevent MRSA infection, we investigated the nosocomial spread of strains of MRSA and studied the characteristics of patients from the clinical standpoint. We found that strict isolation of patients with MRSA infection is an urgent necessity to prevent the intrahospital spread of MRSA strains and that disinfection of the hands of medical staff and sterilization of the environment are extremely important. In addition, due care must be taken to select an adequate antimicrobial agent and to determine the optimal dose and period for treatment of the infection in patients with malignancy to avoid selecting MRSA strains or inducing resistance in mecA positive strains of S. aureus. For treatment of MRSA infections in patients with malignancy, a combination chemotherapy with vancomycin (VCM), or arbekacin (ABK) plus beta-lactam antibiotic is recommended, and granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) is clinically useful when the granulocytopenia was induced by chemotherapy.","['Tanaka, K', 'Tokunaga, N', 'Natori, H', 'Oizumi, K']","['Tanaka K', 'Tokunaga N', 'Natori H', 'Oizumi K']","['First Dept. of Internal Medicine, Kurume University School of Medicine.']",['jpn'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Japan,Gan To Kagaku Ryoho,Gan to kagaku ryoho.

A 51-year-old man was studied who presented with back pain, circulating myeloblasts, and hypercalcemia. The bone marrow revealed acute myeloblastic leukemia. While the ionized calcium concentration was 8.17 mg/dL (normal, 4.73 to 5.21 mg/dL), the levels of PTH, PTH-related peptide, vitamin D, and thyroxine were normal or subnormal. Bone histomorphometry showed a decreased cortical width with intracortical erosion cavities dissecting into the marrow space. In cancellous bone, the osteoid area, osteoblast perimeter, and tetracycline fluorescence were sparse, whereas the osteoclast perimeter was increased. Persistent marrow fat, the general absence of trabecular narrowing, and the prompt response to calcitonin suggest that the osteoclasts caused the hypercalcemia and lytic lesions, rather than pressure atrophy or osteolysis by leukemic infiltration. Osteoclast activation and subsequent hypercalcemia may have been due to a locally produced cytokine, such as interleukin-1 beta or tumor necrosis factor.","['Kent, A B', 'Weinstein, R S']","['Kent AB', 'Weinstein RS']","['Department of Medicine, Medical College of Georgia, Augusta 30912.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Am J Med Sci,The American journal of the medical sciences,0370506,IM,"['Biopsy', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Bone and Bones/*pathology', 'Cytarabine/therapeutic use', 'Etidronic Acid/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Hypercalcemia/blood/*etiology/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/complications/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Osteoclasts/*pathology']",1993/09/01 00:00,1993/09/01 00:01,['1993/09/01 00:00'],"['1993/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0002-9629(15)35442-2 [pii]', '10.1097/00000441-199309000-00008 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Med Sci. 1993 Sep;306(3):169-73. doi: 10.1097/00000441-199309000-00008.,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'M2F465ROXU (Etidronic Acid)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To determine whether this observation is unique to L cells, membranes of human K562 erythroleukemia cells and human A431 epidermoid cells were subjected to virus overlay protein blot assays. The profiles of reovirus binding proteins of these cells are similar to that of L cells and reovirus is capable of binding to at least 30 membrane proteins. To determine the fate of reovirus binding proteins during viral entry into K562 cells which are infectible by reovirus, cell surface proteins were derivatized with biotin. During viral entry, biotinylated cell surface proteins with molecular masses of 55, 74, 78, 80, 90, 94, 98, and 115 kDa became internalized. The 90- and 115-kDa proteins also bound reovirus, indicating that they are likely to be reovirus receptors. Thus many virus binding proteins are present at the surface of host cells but very few are internalized during entry of reovirus. K562 cells also express glycophorin A which is the putative reovirus receptor on erythrocytes. However, during entry of reovirus into K562 cells, glycophorin A did not appear to become internalized. Reovirus could be shown to attach to erythrocytes but viral entry into these cells could not be demonstrated.","['Choi, A H']",['Choi AH'],"['Division of Clinical Virology, J. N.

We have previously shown that HTLV-II Rex acts through an element in R/U5 of the 5' long terminal repeat (LTR), the Rex-responsive element (RxRE), and that Rex protein binds to specific RNA sequences, the Rex binding element (RBE), contained within the RxRE (Black et al., J. Virol. 65, 6645-6653, 1991b). Rex action through the RBE (nt 405-520) overcomes the inhibition of expression conferred by a contiguous LTR RNA regulatory element, which contains cis-acting repressive sequences (CRS; nt 520-630) that are not bound by Rex protein (Black et al., Virology, 181, 433-444, 1991a). We now show by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) that cellular proteins in a HeLa nuclear extract bind specifically to RNA transcripts containing the HTLV-II CRS. Using ultraviolet (uv) crosslinking of gel-retarded bands, we identified a major protein species of approximately 60 kDa, p60CRS, that binds to CRS RNA and, with weaker affinity, to RBE RNA. In addition, a distinct 40-kDa protein, p40CRS, binds to U5 RNA (nt 645-750) downstream from the CRS. Specific deletions within CRS RNA can reduce or abrogate binding to this 60-kDa protein. EMSA and uv crosslinking assays also suggest that both p60CRS and p40CRS interact with CRS RNA. CRS function in a 5' LTR-linked gene expression assay correlates with the ability of both p60CRS and p40CRS to interact with 5' LTR RNA in vitro.","['Black, A C', 'Ruland, C T', 'Luo, J', 'Bakker, A', 'Fraser, J K', 'Rosenblatt, J D']","['Black AC', 'Ruland CT', 'Luo J', 'Bakker A', 'Fraser JK', 'Rosenblatt JD']","['Department of Medicine, UCLA School of Medicine 90024.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase/genetics', 'Cross-Linking Reagents', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'HeLa Cells', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 2/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'RNA, Viral/genetics/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid/*genetics', 'Repressor Proteins/*metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Ultraviolet Rays']",1994/04/01 00:00,1994/04/01 00:01,['1994/04/01 00:00'],"['1994/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0042-6822(84)71159-7 [pii]', '10.1006/viro.1994.1159 [doi]']",ppublish,Virology. 1994 Apr;200(1):29-41. doi: 10.1006/viro.1994.1159.,"['0 (Cross-Linking Reagents)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.3.1.28 (Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase)']",,,,"['K11 CA 01566/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'NIAID AI-28697/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R29 CA 61545/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These analyses add 9 additional years of follow-up for leukemia and 12 for myeloma to that in the last comprehensive reports on these diseases. This is the first analysis of the lymphoma incidence data in the cohort. Using both the Leukemia Registry and the Hiroshima and Nagasaki tumor registries, a total of 290 leukemia, 229 lymphoma and 73 myeloma cases were identified. The primary analyses were restricted to first primary tumors diagnosed among residents of the cities or surrounding areas with Dosimetry System 1986 dose estimates between 0 and 4 Gy kerma (231 leukemias, 208 lymphomas and 62 myelomas). Analyses focused on time-dependent models for the excess absolute risk. Separate analyses were carried out for acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), chronic myelocytic leukemia (CML) and adult T-cell leukemia (ATL). There were few cases of chronic lymphocytic leukemia in this population. There was strong evidence of radiation-induced risks for all subtypes except ATL, and there were significant subtype differences with respect to the effects of age at exposure and sex and in the temporal pattern of risk. The AML dose-response function was nonlinear, whereas there was no evidence against linearity for the other subtypes. When averaged over the follow-up period, the excess absolute risk (EAR) estimates (in cases per 10(4) PY Sv) for the leukemia subtypes were 0.6, 1.1 and 0.9 for ALL, AML and CML, respectively. The corresponding estimated average excess relative risks at 1 Sv are 9.1, 3.3 and 6.2 respectively. There was some evidence of an increased risk of lymphoma in males (EAR = 0.6 cases per 10(4) PY Sv) but no evidence of any excess in females.

However, our studies of immunomodulation by highly purified naturally occurring tumor gangliosides provide another perspective: while the immunosuppressive activity of gangliosides requires the intact molecule (both carbohydrate and ceramide moieties), ceramide structure strikingly influences ganglioside immunosuppressive activity. Molecular species of human neuroblastoma GD2 ganglioside in which the ceramide contains a shorter fatty acyl chain (C16:0, C18:0) were 6- to 10-fold more active than those with a longer fatty acyl chain (C22:0/C24:1, C24:0). These findings were confirmed in studies of ceramide species of human leukemia sialosylparagloboside and murine lymphoma GalNAcGM1b. Gangliosides that contain shorter-chain fatty acids (and are most immunosuppressive) are known to be preferentially shed by tumor cells. Therefore, the results suggest that the tumor cell is optimized to protect itself from host immune destruction by selective shedding of highly active ceramide species of gangliosides.","['Ladisch, S', 'Li, R', 'Olson, E']","['Ladisch S', 'Li R', 'Olson E']","[""Center for Cancer and Transplantation Biology, Children's National Medical Center, Washington, DC 20010.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Animals', 'Brain/immunology', 'Brain Chemistry', 'Carbohydrate Sequence', 'Ceramides/*chemistry/immunology/pharmacology', 'Gangliosides/*chemistry/immunology/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Immune Tolerance', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*chemistry/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasms/*chemistry/*immunology', 'Neuroblastoma/chemistry/immunology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/chemistry/immunology']",1994/03/01 00:00,1994/03/01 00:01,['1994/03/01 00:00'],"['1994/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.91.5.1974 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1994 Mar 1;91(5):1974-8. doi: 10.1073/pnas.91.5.1974.,"['0 (Ceramides)', '0 (Gangliosides)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '65988-71-8 (ganglioside, GD2)']",,,,,,,,PMC43287,,,,,,,,,,

Oligonucleotides were designed to form triple helices with a purine-rich, double-stranded target by binding in the major groove in an orientation anti-parallel to the most purine-rich strand of the target. A 45 base-pair purine-rich region located within the gag gene of Friend Murine Leukemia Virus (FMLV) was used as the duplex target. The target DNA was inserted by molecular cloning downstream of either the bacterial T7- or T3 promoter. The sequence-specific interaction of the triple helix-forming oligonucleotide (TFO) with the FMLV target was confirmed by DNAse I footprint analysis. The affinity of the TFO, as measured by the equilibrium dissociation constant of the TFO for the duplex, was determined by band shift analysis. When a TFO was allowed to form a triple helix with the target duplex in well-defined buffer conditions before the transcription reaction, truncated transcripts of a predicted size were observed. Attenuation of transcription was observed only when buffer conditions favorable to triple helix formation were used. In addition, oligonucleotides containing a high percentage of guanosine residues were able to inhibit mRNA production of the bacterial T7 polymerase by a mechanism independent of transcription attenuation. The ability of an oligonucleotide-directed triple helical structure to slow down, or even completely stop, RNA chain elongation may expand the utility of triple helix technology in the area of gene regulation.","['Rando, R F', 'DePaolis, L', 'Durland, R H', 'Jayaraman, K', 'Kessler, D J', 'Hogan, M E']","['Rando RF', 'DePaolis L', 'Durland RH', 'Jayaraman K', 'Kessler DJ', 'Hogan ME']","['Triplex Pharmaceutical Corporation, The Woodlands, TX 77380.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Nucleic Acids Res,Nucleic acids research,0411011,IM,"['Bacteriophage T3/enzymology/*genetics', 'Bacteriophage T7/enzymology/*genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'DNA-Directed RNA Polymerases/*genetics/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Kinetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides/genetics', '*Transcription, Genetic']",1994/02/25 00:00,1994/02/25 00:01,['1994/02/25 00:00'],"['1994/02/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/02/25 00:01 [medline]', '1994/02/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/nar/22.4.678 [doi]'],ppublish,Nucleic Acids Res. 1994 Feb 25;22(4):678-85. doi: 10.1093/nar/22.4.678.,"['0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', 'EC 2.7.7.6 (DNA-Directed RNA Polymerases)']",,,,,,,,PMC307860,,,,,,,,,,

In vitro, leukaemia inhibitory factor, oncostatin M, ciliary neurotrophic factor and interleukin-11 display overlapping activities with IL-6. This functional redundancy may be explained by the interactions of specific binding receptors with a common signal-transducing receptor (gp130) (for reviews see refs 3, 4). To elucidate the unique function of IL-6 in vivo, we have disrupted the IL-6 gene by homologous recombination. IL-6-deficient mice develop normally. They fail to control efficiently vaccinia virus and infection with Listeria monocytogenes, a facultative intracellular bacterium. The T-cell-dependent antibody response against vesicular stomatitis virus is impaired. Further, the inflammatory acute-phase response after tissue damage or infection is severely compromised, whereas it is only moderately affected after challenge with lipopolysaccharide. We conclude that IL-6 production induced by injury or infection is an important in vivo SOS signal which coordinates activities of liver cells, macrophages and lymphocytes.","['Kopf, M', 'Baumann, H', 'Freer, G', 'Freudenberg, M', 'Lamers, M', 'Kishimoto, T', 'Zinkernagel, R', 'Bluethmann, H', 'Kohler, G']","['Kopf M', 'Baumann H', 'Freer G', 'Freudenberg M', 'Lamers M', 'Kishimoto T', 'Zinkernagel R', 'Bluethmann H', 'Kohler G']","['Max-Planck-Institut fur Immunbiologie, Freiburg, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Nature,Nature,0410462,IM,"['Acute-Phase Reaction/*immunology', 'Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', '*Immunity/immunology/physiology', 'Interleukin-6/*deficiency/genetics/physiology', 'Listeriosis/immunology', 'Lymphoid Tissue/embryology/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Rhabdoviridae Infections/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Vesicular stomatitis Indiana virus/immunology']",1994/03/24 00:00,1994/03/24 00:01,['1994/03/24 00:00'],"['1994/03/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/03/24 00:01 [medline]', '1994/03/24 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/368339a0 [doi]'],ppublish,Nature. 1994 Mar 24;368(6469):339-42. doi: 10.1038/368339a0.,"['0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The clinical response of leukemic cells to chemotherapy is roughly due to two factors: the effective drug levels reaching the cells and the resistance of these cells to the drugs. The clinical value of cellular drug resistance in children with ALL is not known. We developed an in vitro assay to study drug resistance in these children. In this article, the main results obtained with this MTT assay on samples from 137 children with ALL are summarized: (1) patients whose cells are resistant to several drugs at initial diagnosis have a poor prognosis; (2) relapsed leukemias show a considerable drug resistance which might partly explain the poor prognosis. Relapsed cases differ in their type and degree of resistance; (3) the poor outcome of high risk groups as defined by age and immunophenotype can partly be explained by specific patterns of drug resistance; (4) P-glycoprotein-mediated multidrug resistance is not an important cause of resistance in childhood ALL; and (5) no relation exists between the activities of the purine enzymes HGPRT, 5'NT, ADA, and PNP and drug resistance in childhood ALL.

The region of interest was amplified with two rounds of polymerase chain reactions (PCR) with nested primers and directly sequenced. No point mutations were found in the investigated samples. Thus, point mutations in this segment of the c-kit gene do not seem to play an important role in the transformation process of human acute leukemia.","['Arland, M', 'Fiedler, W', 'Samalecos, A', 'Hossfeld, D K']","['Arland M', 'Fiedler W', 'Samalecos A', 'Hossfeld DK']","['Department of Oncology/Hematology, University Hospital Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Base Sequence', 'Codon/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/genetics', '*Point Mutation', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogenes/*genetics', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA']",1994/03/01 00:00,1994/03/01 00:01,['1994/03/01 00:00'],"['1994/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1994 Mar;8(3):498-501.,"['0 (Codon)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)']",,,,,['c-kit'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this report we show that coculture with human, but not mouse, bone marrow stromal cell lines allows maintenance of clonogenic cells. One line in particular (197/17) allowed continuous expansion of clonogenic cells with no evidence of differentiation. The maintenance of clonogenic cells correlated with maintenance of tumor stem cells. Even after 9 months continuous passaging on stromal cells, the cultured cells produced tumors on injection into syngeneic mice with the same latency as cells from explanted tumors. We demonstrated that this activity was due to a soluble factor in 197/17 conditioned medium. An extensive survey of known factors, either alone or in combination, failed to reproduce this effect, implying that the effect was due to a novel factor acting on self-renewal of early stem cells.","['Duhrsen, U', 'Novotny, J', 'Boyd, A W']","['Duhrsen U', 'Novotny J', 'Boyd AW']","['Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Royal Melbourne Hospital, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Culture Media, Conditioned', 'Growth Substances/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/immunology/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/pathology/physiology', 'Species Specificity', 'Stromal Cells/cytology', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",1994/03/01 00:00,1994/03/01 00:01,['1994/03/01 00:00'],"['1994/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1994 Mar;8(3):490-7.,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (Growth Substances)']",,,,"['CA-22556/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-25972/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The mitogenic action of Staphylococcus aureus Cowan I (SAC), MP6-thioredoxin, and interleukin 2 (IL-2), agents previously shown to induce proliferation in normal as well as in B-CLL cells, lifted this block, and EBV-positive cell lines could be established. It was not possible to establish cell lines of leukemic origin from cultures that were incubated with EBV alone or cytokine mix alone. CLL-cells infected with EBV only, expressed the viral nuclear antigen complex (EBNA), but not the viral latent membrane protein (LMP). They were not activated as measured by cell size and 3H-thymidine incorporation. In contrast, cells incubated with EBV and cytokine mix expressed both EBNA and LMP in parallel with enlargement and increased 3H-thymidine incorporation. These results emphasize that LMP expression is a prerequisite for growth transformation and immortalization and that cytokine activation signals are required for its expression in B-CLLs. Cells incubated with SAC/MP6-thioredoxin/IL-2 did not express any of the viral antigens, but were activated with regard to the mentioned parameters. Nine cell lines were established from six patients. From each of the three patients, we obtained 'twin'-pair lines: one corresponding to the malignant cell and the other to a normal B-lymphoblastoid cell. Thus, malignant and normal B-cell counterparts, from the very same donor, are at hand for comparative studies. The cell lines have been carried out for more than 12 months in culture.

When 22-oxa-1 alpha, 25(OH)2D3 (D3), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and all-trans retinoic acid (RA) were used as differentiation-inducers, varying degrees of apoptosis were seen. D3 induced monocytoid differentiation, but not apoptosis above the control level. On the other hand, RA induced profound apoptosis concomitant with the progressive expression of differentiation markers. Studies on morphology, functions and phenotypes of P39 cells exposed to differentiation inducers suggest that the incidence of apoptosis was not affected by the process of differentiation, but cells in the process of varying degrees of differentiation may die via apoptosis. Moreover, RA-treated P39 cells are unique in the simultaneous occurrence of profound apoptosis and differentiation.

Information is also limited about interindividual differences in the plasma AUC infinity (area-under-the-curve concentration to time infinity) and renal elimination of mitoxantrone and its main metabolites, mono- and dicarboxylic acid. In the present study, the plasma concentration of mitoxantrone was measured by HPLC during 120 h after the end of a 30-min infusion of 10 mg/m2 in 18 patients undergoing combination therapy with mitoxantrone and high-dose cytosine arabinoside for acute myeloid leukemia. Plasma kinetics and renal elimination of mono- and dicarboxylic acid were analyzed in addition in eight of these patients, and in five cases with chronic lymphocytic leukemia receiving a 30-min infusion of 5 mg/m2 mitoxantrone weekly for 3 consecutive weeks. Fitting the results to a three compartment model, a substantial interindividual variation was observed for plasma and urine pharmacokinetics. Plasma AUC infinity for mitoxantrone differed approximately 13-fold between individual patients and varied between 80-1030 ngh/ml. The corresponding values for mono- and dicarboxylic acid ranged from 23-147 ngh/ml and 51-471 ngh/ml, respectively. The median terminal half-life for mitoxantrone was similar to that of the mono- and dicarboxylic acid and was 75 h. Cumulative renal elimination ranged from 670-1950 micrograms for mitoxantrone, from 366-852 micrograms for monocarboxylic acid, and from 792-3420 micrograms for dicarboxylic acid. Renal clearance of mitoxantrone reached a median level of 69 ml/min and for the total plasma clearance a median of 1136 ml/min was found. The corresponding values for the mono- and dicarboxymetabolites were 57 and 67 ml/min. In contrast to the great interindividual differences in pharmacokinetic results, a low intraindividual variability was observed upon repeated determinations of renal elimination of mitoxantrone and its metabolites at weekly intervals in five patients. These data provide new insights into the pharmacokinetic of mitoxantrone and its main metabolites revealing substantial differences in drug metabolism and elimination between individual patients. Further studies are needed to explore the potential impact on response and/or toxicity and the requirement of a pharmacokinetic directed adjustment of drug dosage in clinical trials.","['Schleyer, E', 'Kamischke, A', 'Kaufmann, C C', 'Unterhalt, M', 'Hiddemann, W']","['Schleyer E', 'Kamischke A', 'Kaufmann CC', 'Unterhalt M', 'Hiddemann W']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Gottingen, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Carboxylic Acids/pharmacokinetics', 'Half-Life', 'Humans', 'Kidney/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitoxantrone/blood/*pharmacokinetics/urine']",1994/03/01 00:00,1994/03/01 00:01,['1994/03/01 00:00'],"['1994/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1994 Mar;8(3):435-40.,"['0 (Carboxylic Acids)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Leukemia cells are identified among the normal cells through the use of a leukemic cell-specific signature, such as the junction formed following rearrangement of the immunoglobulin (Ig) or T-cell receptor (TCR) variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J) regions. We cloned the rearranged Ig or TCR genes from leukemic cells at the time of diagnosis by regular recombinant DNA techniques, or following PCR amplification, and determined the leukemic cell-specific V(D)J junctions. Using oligonucleotides prepared to the unique junctional sequences, we have analyzed Southern blots of PCR-amplified Ig or TCR genes from 11 patients at the time of diagnosis, and in from three to 14 follow-up samples for periods ranging from 17 to 97 months. The level of detection of residual blast cells in these patients was usually on the order of 1 leukemic cell in 10(4) normal ones. Conditions for the hybridization and washing were individually adjusted so that the specificity of the probes was excellent. No residual leukemic cells were found in patients who remained in continuous complete remission at time points more than 6 months post-diagnosis. PCR detected impending relapse in four out of six cases, with PCR-detectable leukemic clones being present 2, 4, 13 and 20 months prior to clinical signs of the disease. Relapse occurred in two patients who lacked PCR evidence of leukemic blasts in marrow samples collected 2 and 6 months before clinical recurrence, respectively. The leukemic cells that persisted for 3 years after a relapse in a patient who remained in clinical remission during this time period eventually became undetectable by PCR.","['Kitchingman, G R']",['Kitchingman GR'],"[""Department of Virology and Molecular Biology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38101.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Child', 'DNA Probes', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Heavy Chain', '*Gene Rearrangement, delta-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor', '*Gene Rearrangement, gamma-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor', 'Humans', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Time Factors']",1994/03/01 00:00,1994/03/01 00:01,['1994/03/01 00:00'],"['1994/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1994 Mar;8(3):395-401.,['0 (DNA Probes)'],,,,"['CA-20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-52259/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Clonogenic assays from colony-forming units of the granulocyte-macrophage lineage (CFU-GM) and leukemic clonogenic cells (CFU-L) were applied using human placenta conditioned medium (HPCM) as source of growth factors. Before seeding cells in clonogenic assay they were exposed to the anthracyclines for 2 h without preincubation, or following a 48 h preincubation period in the presence of HPCM. Drug concentrations used ranged from 0.001-0.1 microgram/ml for idarubicin and from 0.1-1.5 microgram/ml for doxorubicin. In addition, a limited number of bone marrow samples were exposed to the cytostatically active metabolite of idarubicin; idarubicinol (Idol; range 0.001-0.1 microgram/ml). Proliferation of CFU-GM and CFU-L during 48 h was measured by iododeoxyuridine (IdUrd) incorporation. Spontaneous proliferation of CFU-GM increased from 38 to 88% after 48 h stimulation by HPCM. The mean number of proliferating CFU-L increased from 40 to 77% when stimulated with HPCM. Doxorubicin inhibited colony formation of CFU-GM and CFU-L to 50% (IC50CFU-GM, IC50CFU-I) at mean concentrations of 0.355 microgram/ml and 0.103 microgram/ml when applied before preincubation with HPCM, and 0.108 microgram/ml and 0.055 microgram/ml when applied after preincubation. Idarubicin appeared the most potent drug in all experiments regardless of the preincubation procedure or sample origin, with average IC50CFU-GM and IC50CFU-L of 0.008 microgram/ml and 0.006 microgram/ml, respectively, when applied before preincubation with HPCM, and 0.006 microgram/ml and 0.005 microgram/ml when applied after preincubation with HPCM. Idarubicinol showed intermediate potency with average IC50CFU-GM of 0.022 microgram/ml and 0.023 microgram/ml when applied before and after preincubation with HPCM, respectively. In order to assess the effect of growth stimulation on drug sensitivity, samples were evaluated pair-wise (sensitivity of the same sample before vs. after preincubation with HPCM) and were submitted to the Wilcoxon test for matched pairs. Statistically significant enhancement of cytotoxicity was demonstrated for Doxorubicin vs. CFU-GM (p < or = 0.021) and a strong trend versus CFU-L (p = 0.06). The data further demonstrate that proliferation-dependency of doxorubicin toxicity is more pronounced for CFU-GM than for CFU-L. These data also show that idarubicin and idarubicinol toxicity is proliferation-independent. Idarubicin is relatively more potent than doxorubicin in suppressing the growth potential of low or nonproliferating progenitors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Minderman, H', 'Linssen, P', 'van der Lely, N', 'Wessels, J', 'Boezeman, J', 'de Witte, T', 'Haanen, C']","['Minderman H', 'Linssen P', 'van der Lely N', 'Wessels J', 'Boezeman J', 'de Witte T', 'Haanen C']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital Nijmegen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Daunorubicin/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Doxorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Granulocytes/*drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'Macrophages/*drug effects', '*Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",1994/03/01 00:00,1994/03/01 00:01,['1994/03/01 00:00'],"['1994/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1994 Mar;8(3):382-7.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '86189-66-4 (idarubicinol)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We analysed the overall and disease-free survival (DFS) in relation to various prognostic factors, focusing on the dosage of DNM actually received during the induction period. Complete remission (CR) was achieved in 68 (79%) patients and the overall DFS was of 32 months (median follow-up 37 months); 22 patients (25.6%) are off-therapy and disease-free. The actual dosage of DNM received during induction turned out to be an independent DFS prognostic factor. In fact, patients who received more or less than 175 mg/sqm in induction had a median DFS of 44 and 12 months, respectively (p = 0.05). The plateau of DFS in the two groups was 44% and 21%, respectively. Similar data were found analyzing the dose-intensity (mg/sqm/week) of DNM given in induction.

Classically, AcPs have been divided into four types according to their sensitivity to tartrate and to their origin: erythrocytic, lysosomal, prostatic AcP, and an AcP enzyme that was first identified in hairy cell leukemia (HCL). This latter AcP was termed isoenzyme 5 (based on its electrophoretic mobility) or human type 5, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP). Differences in various physicochemical properties, lack of amino acid sequence similarity and different chromosomal locations of the respective genes showed that the four AcP isoenzymes are not related. The biochemical properties of TRAP are unique: resistance to inhibition by tartrate, but inhibition by molybdate; glycoprotein of 30-40 kDa occurring as two similar isoforms with different carbohydrate content, each composed of dissimilar subunits of 16 and 23 kDa in disulfide linkage; active at acid pH (optimum at 5-6) with basic pI (8.5-9.0); presence of an iron active site giving the purified protein a purple color. The TRAPs of different human sources (HCL spleen, osteoclastoma, Gaucher's spleen, placenta) have an 85-94% homology in their amino acid sequences. Full-length TRAP cDNAs (1.4 kb) have been cloned from human placenta and Gaucher's spleen. Variations in TRAP structure appear to result from post-translational modifications and not from the existence of a multigene family as only a single TRAP gene and a single mRNA species have been reported. This notion of a single TRAP gene is supported by the substantial sequence homology found among the various TRAPs from human tissues and from animal sources (e.g. bovine spleen and bone; rat spleen, bone and epidermis; pig uterus). The latter enzyme preparations of animal origin have been described for many years as the purple acid phosphatase (PAP). However, the high degree of sequence homology indicated that TRAP and PAP enzymes represent a single entity belonging to the class of metalloproteins. The human TRAP gene was assigned to chromosome 15 and to chromosome 19 by two groups. TRAP protein is localized in lysosomes or similar organelles and is not secreted. The serum level of TRAP was found to be increased during physiological bone growth, in Gaucher's disease, and in malignancies metastasized to bone (resulting from increased osteoclastic activity).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Drexler, H G', 'Gignac, S M']","['Drexler HG', 'Gignac SM']","['Department of Human and Animal Cell Cultures, Braunschweig, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Acid Phosphatase/*chemistry/genetics/physiology', 'Biomarkers', 'Forecasting', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/*chemistry/physiology', 'Leukemia/enzymology', 'Research']",1994/03/01 00:00,1994/03/01 00:01,['1994/03/01 00:00'],"['1994/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1994 Mar;8(3):359-68.,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Acid Phosphatase)']",,119,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The murine stromal cell line, BMS2, exhibits the adipocytic and osteoblastic phenotypes in vitro. BMS2 differentiation was examined in response to cytokines which share the gp130 signal transducing protein within their receptor complex. Four of the cytokines (interleukin 6, interleukin 11, leukemia inhibitory factor, and oncostatin M) inhibited hydrocortisone-induced adipocyte differentiation in a dose dependent manner based on lipid accumulation and lipoprotein lipase enzyme activity. Inhibition occurred only when the cytokines were present during the initial 24 h of the induction period; after 48 h their effects were diminished. Likewise, these cytokines increased alkaline phosphatase enzyme activity twofold in preadipocyte BMS2 cells. Both leukemia inhibitory factor and oncostatin M induced early active gene expression in resting preadipocyte BMS2 cells and decreased the steady state mRNA level of a unique osteoblastic gene marker, osteocalcin. A fifth cytokine whose receptor complex shares the gp130 protein, ciliary neurotrophic factor, did not significantly regulate stromal cell differentiation when added by itself. However, with the addition of a missing component of its receptor complex, ciliary neurotrophic factor receptor alpha protein, this cytokine also inhibited BMS2 adipogenesis. Together, these data indicate that the cytokines whose receptors share the gp130 protein can modulate stromal cell commitment to the adipocyte and osteoblast differentiation pathways.","['Gimble, J M', 'Wanker, F', 'Wang, C S', 'Bass, H', 'Wu, X', 'Kelly, K', 'Yancopoulos, G D', 'Hill, M R']","['Gimble JM', 'Wanker F', 'Wang CS', 'Bass H', 'Wu X', 'Kelly K', 'Yancopoulos GD', 'Hill MR']","['Immunobiology and Cancer Program, Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation, Oklahoma City 73104.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,IM,"['Adipocytes/cytology', 'Animals', '*Antigens, CD', '*Bone Marrow Cells', '*Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130', 'Cytokines/*pharmacology', 'Genes, Immediate-Early', 'Growth Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hydrocortisone/pharmacology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Interleukins/pharmacology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lipoprotein Lipase/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Lymphokines/pharmacology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/pharmacology', 'Oncostatin M', 'Osteoblasts/cytology', 'Peptides/pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Cytokine/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stromal Cells/cytology']",1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcb.240540113 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 1994 Jan;54(1):122-33. doi: 10.1002/jcb.240540113.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (IL6ST protein, human)', '0 (Il6st protein, mouse)', '0 (Il6st protein, rat)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Interleukins)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (OSM protein, human)', '0 (Osm protein, mouse)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '106956-32-5 (Oncostatin M)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)', 'EC 3.1.1.34 (Lipoprotein Lipase)', 'WI4X0X7BPJ (Hydrocortisone)']",,,,['CA50898/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A preferential concentration of globin gene sequences, as compared to satellite DNA, was noted in a physiological salt-soluble, histone H1-depleted, mononucleosomal chromatin fraction (Sup 120) in all Friend cell types, even those in which the globin gene was not capable of transcriptional activation by chemical induction. The level of globin gene enrichment in the Sup 120 fraction was highest in the most malignant and inducible cell type. The chemical induction of erythroid differentiation in this cell line did not change the distribution of globin genes in the chromatin fractions. The Sup 120 chromatin fraction prepared from mouse brain nuclei was not enriched in globin genes. Besides the previously reported low H2A. 1/H2A.2 ratio [Blankstein and Levy: Nature 260:638-640, 1976], chromatin from the most tumorigenic cell type showed the lowest H2B.2 to H2B.1 ratio, highest levels of histone H4 acetylation, and the most pronounced change in relative amounts of two major electrophoretic bands of histone H1 variants as compared to the less malignant cell types. The histone variant content of the micrococcal nuclease-generated chromatin fractions from the three Friend cell types reflected the core histone variant differences for the respective intact nuclei. However, the electrophoretic separation of mononucleosomes by size revealed several classes with different H2A variant ratios. The results demonstrate the existence of structural differences in globin gene and histone variants in erythroleukemia cell chromatin associated with distinguishable phenotypes during malignant cell progression.","['Leonardson, K E', 'Levy, S B']","['Leonardson KE', 'Levy SB']","['Department of Medicine and Molecular Biology, Tufts University School of Medicine, New England Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts 02111.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,IM,"['Acetylation', 'Animals', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Chromatin/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Genetic Variation', 'Globins/*genetics', 'Histones/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Micrococcal Nuclease/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcb.240540112 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 1994 Jan;54(1):110-21. doi: 10.1002/jcb.240540112.,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Histones)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', 'EC 3.1.31.1 (Micrococcal Nuclease)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Whereas SSP has been shown to halt the cell cycle progression of various normal, nontransformed cell types in G1, most virus transformed or tumor cells are unaffected in G1 but arrest in G2 phase. SSP has also been observed to increase the appearance of cells with higher DNA content, suggestive of endoreduplication, in cultures of tumor cells. Using multivariate flow cytometry (DNA content vs. expression of cyclin B, nuclear p120 protein, or protein reactive with Ki-67 antibody) which makes it possible to discriminate cells with identical DNA content but at different phases of the cycle, we have studied the cell cycle progression of human lymphocytic leukemic MOLT-4 cells in the presence of 0.1 microM SSP. MOLT-4 cells did not arrest in G1 or G2 phase in the presence of the inhibitor. Rather, they failed to undergo cytokinesis, entering G1 phase at higher DNA ploidy (tetraploidy; G1T), and then progressed through ST (rereplication) into G2T and MT. The rates of entrance to G2 and G2T were essentially identical, indicating that the rates of cell progression through S and ST as well as through G2 and G2T, respectively, were similar. Cells entrance to mitosis and mitotic chromatin condensation were also similar at the diploid and tetraploid DNA content level and were unaffected by 0.1 microM SSP. No evidence of growth imbalance (altered protein or RNA to DNA ratio) was observed in the case of tetraploid cells. The data show that, in the case of MOLT-4 cells, all events associated with the chromosome or DNA cycle were unaffected by SSP; the only target of the inhibitor appears to be kinase(s) controlling cytokinesis.","['Traganos, F', 'Gong, J', 'Ardelt, B', 'Darzynkiewicz, Z']","['Traganos F', 'Gong J', 'Ardelt B', 'Darzynkiewicz Z']","['Cancer Research Institute, New York Medical College, Elmsford 10523.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,IM,"['Alkaloids/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects/*physiology', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Separation/methods', 'Cyclins/analysis/metabolism', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis/genetics', 'Flow Cytometry', 'G1 Phase', '*G2 Phase', 'Humans', 'Ki-67 Antigen', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mitosis', 'Neoplasm Proteins/immunology', 'Nuclear Proteins/analysis/immunology/metabolism', 'Ploidies', 'RNA, Neoplasm/analysis/genetics', 'S Phase', 'Staurosporine', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'tRNA Methyltransferases']",1994/03/01 00:00,1994/03/01 00:01,['1994/03/01 00:00'],"['1994/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.1041580320 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 1994 Mar;158(3):535-44. doi: 10.1002/jcp.1041580320.,"['0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Ki-67 Antigen)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (NOP2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (tRNA Methyltransferases)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)']",,,,['R01 CA28704/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A possible involvement of these receptors in heme biosynthesis.,7527-31,"To search for a possible role for peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors (PBR) during erythroid differentiation, we cloned the PBR isoquinoline carboxamide-binding protein (PBR/IBP), an 18-kDa protein on PBR, from a mouse erythroleukemia (MEL) cell cDNA library. Sequence analysis revealed that PBR/IBP comprises 169 amino acid residues (M(r) 18,828), and has a high homology with PBR/IBP from other sources. The cDNA allows for the expression of active PBR/IBP, exhibiting a high affinity for isoquinoline carboxamide, [3H]PK11195, with Kd of 0.80 and 1.56 nM. RNA blot analysis revealed that treatment of MEL cells with dimethyl sulfoxide led to an increase in PBR/IBP mRNA (delta 1.0 kilobases) for up to 72 h, with a concomitant induction of mRNAs for heme biosynthetic enzymes, coproporphyrinogen oxidase and ferrochelatase. The induction of PBR/IBP mRNA was also observed in MEL cells induced with diazepam. The binding activity of [3H]PK11195 in MEL cells showed a high affinity with Kd of 0.69-2.13 nM, and increased during erythroid differentiation. The order of potency of different ligands to compete against [3H]PK11195 binding in induced MEL cells was PK11195 > protoporphyrin IX > diazepam > coproporphyrinogen III > coproporphyrin III > estazolam. In contrast to the induction of PBR/IBP in induced MEL cells, the voltage-dependent anion channel (mitochondrial porin) associated with PBR remained unchanged. These results suggest that PBR/IBP on PBR may be involved in porphyrin transport and may even be a critical factor in erythroid-specific induction of heme biosynthesis.","['Taketani, S', 'Kohno, H', 'Okuda, M', 'Furukawa, T', 'Tokunaga, R']","['Taketani S', 'Kohno H', 'Okuda M', 'Furukawa T', 'Tokunaga R']","['Department of Hygiene, Kansai Medical University, Osaka, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Coproporphyrinogen Oxidase/genetics', 'DNA, Complementary', 'Ferrochelatase/genetics', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Heme/*biosynthesis', 'Isoquinolines/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Receptors, GABA-A/*biosynthesis/genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/03/11 00:00,1994/03/11 00:01,['1994/03/11 00:00'],"['1994/03/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/03/11 00:01 [medline]', '1994/03/11 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(17)37318-0 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1994 Mar 11;269(10):7527-31.,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Isoquinolines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, GABA-A)', '42VZT0U6YR (Heme)', 'EC 1.3.3.3 (Coproporphyrinogen Oxidase)', 'EC 4.99.1.1 (Ferrochelatase)', 'YNF83VN1RL (PK 11195)']",,,,,,,['GENBANK/D21207'],,,,,,,,,,,

In most populations of feral mice these indigenous retroviruses were infrequently expressed and cancer seldom occurred until later in life (> 2 years old). MMTV was found in the milk of about 50% of wild mice, but was associated with only a low incidence (> 1%) of breast cancer after one year of age. By contrast, in several populations, most notably at a squab farm near Lake Casitas (LC), infectious MuLV acquired at birth via milk was highly prevalent, and the infected mice were prone to leukemia and a lower motor neuron paralytic disease after one year of age. These two diseases were both caused by the same infectious (ecotropic) strain of MuLV and were the principal cause of premature death in these aging LC mice. A dominant gene called FV-4R restricting the infection with ecotropic MuLV was found segregating in LC mice. Mice inheriting this FV-4R allele were resistant to the ecotropic MuLV associated lymphoma and paralysis. The FV-4R allele represents a defective endogenous MuLV provirus DNA segment that expresses an ecotropic MuLV envelope-related glycoprotein (gp70) on the cell surface. This FV-4R encoded gp70 presumably occupies the receptor for ecotropic MuLV and blocks entry of the virus. The FV-4R gene was probably acquired by the naturally occurring crossbreeding of LC feral mice with another species of feral mice (Mus castaneus) from Southeast Asia. The FV-4R gp70 does not block entry of the amphotropic MuLV that uses a separate cell surface receptor. Therefore LC mice continued to be susceptible to the highly prevalent but weakly lymphogenic and nonparalytogenic amphotropic strain of MuLV.

A FUSE-binding protein (FBP) is present in undifferentiated but not differentiated cells. Peptide sequences from the purified protein allowed cloning of cDNAs encoding FBP. Expression of FBP mRNA declined upon differentiation, suggesting transcriptional regulation of FBP. Features in the FBP cDNA suggest that FBP is also regulated by RNA processing, translation, and post-translational mechanisms. Both cellular and recombinant FBP form sequence-specific complexes with a single strand of FUSE. Transfection of FBP into human leukemia cells stimulated c-myc-promoter-driven expression from a reporter plasmid in a FUSE-dependent manner. Deletion and insertion mutagenesis of FBP defined a novel single-strand DNA-binding domain. Analysis of the primary and predicted secondary structure of the amino acid sequence reveals four copies of a reiterated unit comprised of a 30-residue direct repeat and an amphipathic alpha-helix separated by an 18- to 21-residue spacer. The third and fourth copies of this repeat-helix unit constitute the minimum single-stranded DNA-binding domain. To determine whether the FUSE site, in vivo, possesses single-strand conformation, and therefore could be bound by FBP, cells were treated with potassium permanganate (KMnO4) to modify unpaired bases. Modification of genomic DNA in vivo revealed hyperreactivity associated with single-stranded DNA in the FUSE sequence and protection on the strand that binds FBP in vitro. The role of single-stranded DNA and single-strand binding proteins in c-myc regulation is discussed.","['Duncan, R', 'Bazar, L', 'Michelotti, G', 'Tomonaga, T', 'Krutzsch, H', 'Avigan, M', 'Levens, D']","['Duncan R', 'Bazar L', 'Michelotti G', 'Tomonaga T', 'Krutzsch H', 'Avigan M', 'Levens D']","['Laboratory of Pathology, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Genes Dev,Genes & development,8711660,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Cell Line', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'DNA, Single-Stranded/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation', '*Genes, myc', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Structure, Secondary', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid']",1994/02/15 00:00,1994/02/15 00:01,['1994/02/15 00:00'],"['1994/02/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/02/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/02/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1101/gad.8.4.465 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Dev. 1994 Feb 15;8(4):465-80. doi: 10.1101/gad.8.4.465.,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (DNA, Single-Stranded)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)']",,,,['CA54818/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['c-myc'],,['GENBANK/U05040'],,,,,,,,,,,

TGF-alpha is produced by certain tumor cells and embryogenic tissues, as well as by normal cells of different origin. Within the granulocytic lineage, TGF-alpha production has been shown in promyelocytic leukemia cells induced to differentiate, as well as in blood eosinophils of patients with the idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome. The present study was carried out in order to examine expression of the TGF-alpha gene in polymorphonuclear (PMN) and mononuclear (MN) blood cells of normal healthy donors. While MN and neutrophilic PMN failed to synthesize TGF-alpha transcripts and protein, eosinophils constitutively exhibited TGF-alpha transcripts accompanied by the release of immunoreactive TGF-alpha protein. Exposure of PMN and MN cells to the leukocyte-activating cytokines interleukin (IL)-3, IL-5, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor resulted in a several-fold increase of TGF-alpha mRNA expression and protein release by eosinophils, but not by neutrophils and MN cells. PMN and MN were insensitive to induction of TGF-alpha release by IL-8 and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. These results point to a functional role of eosinophils in disorders characterized by unbalanced TGF-alpha production such as disease states associated with abnormal matrix formation and neovascularization which may be explained by the present demonstration of TGF-alpha production in these cells.","['Brach, M A', 'Sott, C', 'Kiehntopf, M', 'Herrmann, F']","['Brach MA', 'Sott C', 'Kiehntopf M', 'Herrmann F']","['Abteilung fur Medizinische Onkologie und Angewandte Molekularbiologie, Freie Universitat Berlin, FRG.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,IM,"['Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'Eosinophils/*metabolism', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/*physiology', 'Interleukin-5/*physiology', 'Male', 'Neutrophils/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Transforming Growth Factor alpha/*genetics']",1994/03/01 00:00,1994/03/01 00:01,['1994/03/01 00:00'],"['1994/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/eji.1830240324 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 1994 Mar;24(3):646-50. doi: 10.1002/eji.1830240324.,"['0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Interleukin-5)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor alpha)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have identified two serine residues of Op18 that are phosphorylated after triggering by the T cell antigen receptor. One of these residues, Ser25, was shown to be a likely substrate for the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase, while the other residue, Ser16, was shown to be phosphorylated in response to increased intracellular calcium. Our previous site-mapping studies of Op18 also revealed that basal phosphorylation of Op18 is mainly located on Ser38, which was found to be the primary in vitro phosphorylation site of p13suc1-precipitated cdc2 kinase activities. These findings raised the possibility that Op18 may be a substrate for both receptor-regulated calcium-induced protein kinases and the MAP kinase family, as well as being a substrate for the cell-cycle-regulated cdc2 kinase family. In the present report we have performed site-mapping studies of cell-cycle-regulated fluctuations of Op18 phosphorylation. The results reveal that S-phase progression of a synchronised leukemic T cell line is associated with increased phosphorylation of both the Ser25 and Ser38 residues. Moreover, during mitosis, a burst of phosphorylation was observed and at this stage of the cell cycle a major fraction of Op18 was phosphorylated at multiple sites. Phosphorylation of Op18 during mitosis was located primarily on Ser38 and to lesser extent on Ser25, Ser16 and at an unidentified C-terminal residue. In vitro phosphorylation experiments, employing two distinct members of the cdc2 kinase family, were consistent with involvement of both p34-cdc2 and p33-cdk2 in cell-cycle-regulated phosphorylation of Ser25 and Ser38 of Op18. Most importantly, the ratio of Ser25/Ser38 phosphorylation observed in vitro, using either p34-cdc2 or p33-cdk2, was found to be the same as the ratio observed in intact cells during all phases of the cell cycle. These findings suggest that Op18 may be a physiological substrate for several members of the cdc2 kinase family during both the S-phase and the mitotic phase of the cell cycle.","['Brattsand, G', 'Marklund, U', 'Nylander, K', 'Roos, G', 'Gullberg, M']","['Brattsand G', 'Marklund U', 'Nylander K', 'Roos G', 'Gullberg M']","['Department for Cell and Molecular Biology, University of Umea, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Biochem,European journal of biochemistry,0107600,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'CDC2 Protein Kinase/*metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/*physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell', '*Microtubule Proteins', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Molecular Weight', 'Peptide Fragments/chemistry/isolation & purification', 'Phosphopeptides/chemistry/isolation & purification', 'Phosphoproteins/chemistry/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phosphoserine', 'Serine/*metabolism', 'Stathmin', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/03/01 00:00,1994/03/01 00:01,['1994/03/01 00:00'],"['1994/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1432-1033.1994.tb18632.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Biochem. 1994 Mar 1;220(2):359-68. doi: 10.1111/j.1432-1033.1994.tb18632.x.,"['0 (Microtubule Proteins)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Phosphopeptides)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (STMN1 protein, human)', '0 (Stathmin)', '17885-08-4 (Phosphoserine)', '452VLY9402 (Serine)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDC2 Protein Kinase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Retrospective chart review. SETTING: Critical care, reverse isolation unit at a university hospital. PATIENTS: Fifty-four pediatric bone marrow transplant recipients who required endotracheal intubation. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The following variables were assessed for effect on survival: a) the presence of additional nonhematoporetic organ system failure; b) the duration of required ventilatory assistance; c) the etiology of respiratory failure; d) the presence of significant graft vs. host disease; and e) the underlying disease for which the transplant was done. Six of 54 intubated pediatric bone marrow transplant recipients were extubated and discharged from the hospital. No patient with a diagnosis of leukemia or with multiple organ system failure could be extubated or discharged from the hospital. The presence of pulmonary parenchymal disease indicated poor prognosis for survival. CONCLUSIONS: The decision to intubate a pediatric bone marrow transplant patient remains a difficult one. In this population, multiple organ system failure and primary pulmonary parenchymal disease were associated with a high mortality rate. These factors should be taken into account before and throughout the course of mechanical ventilation in this patient population.","['Todd, K', 'Wiley, F', 'Landaw, E', 'Gajewski, J', 'Bellamy, P E', 'Harrison, R E', 'Brill, J E', 'Feig, S A']","['Todd K', 'Wiley F', 'Landaw E', 'Gajewski J', 'Bellamy PE', 'Harrison RE', 'Brill JE', 'Feig SA']","['Gwynne Hazen Cherry Memorial Laboratories, Department of Pediatrics, UCLA School of Medicine 90024-1752.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Crit Care Med,Critical care medicine,0355501,IM,"['Adolescent', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Critical Care/*methods', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Intubation, Intratracheal', 'Lung Diseases/mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'Multiple Organ Failure/mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Respiration, Artificial', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome']",1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00003246-199401000-00030 [doi]'],ppublish,Crit Care Med. 1994 Jan;22(1):171-6. doi: 10.1097/00003246-199401000-00030.,,,,,"['CA-16042/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-23175/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'RR-00865/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These P15E-related tumour factors are thought to be responsible for some immunological impairments found in these patients (particularly the defective monocyte chemotaxis). A sequential and functional homology has been reported to exist between a bioactive fragment of interferon alpha (IFN alpha) and the putative immunosuppressive region of retroviral p15E (CKS-17). In this study we investigated (a) a possible functional and structural relationship between p15E and IFN alpha, and (b) the presence of and the relationship between p15E-related low-M(r) factors and IFN alpha in HNscc patients. We report the following results. (a) Recombinant human (rhu) IFN alpha was able to inhibit monocyte chemotaxis. (b) The anti-p15E antibodies crossreacted with rhuIFN alpha in a dot-blot technique; however, the anti-IFN alpha antibodies did not crossreact with disrupted murine leukaemia virus (p15E source). (c) Low-M(r) factors (n = 8-11) prepared from the sera of HNscc patients, which inhibit the monocyte chemotactic responsiveness, could be adsorbed by the anti-p15E antibodies as well as by the anti-IFN alpha antibodies. However, the abilities of the factors to adsorb to the two categories of antibodies (namely, anti-p15E and anti-IFN alpha) did not correlate. (d) Immunohistochemically we found IFN alpha-related epitopes, in almost all HNscc specimens studied (17/18), in locations distinctive from those of p15E-related factors.

Two murine leukemia cell lines, A20 (B lymphocytic) and WEHI-3 (myelomonocytic), were used to investigate antileukemic effector mechanisms operating independently from graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Different results were obtained with the two leukemia models. After injection of A20 cells, the majority of Balb/c recipients treated with syngeneic BMT died due to leukemia relapse (89%). The transplantation of MHC-matched DBA marrow resulted in chronic GvHD but did not reduce the risk of relapse (86%). Grafting of MHC-mismatched (but GvH-nonreactive) marrow cells from (C57xBalb)F1 hybrids, however, led to a significantly lower relapse rate (47%, p < 0.05). In vitro testing revealed that F1 cells but not Balb/c or DBA cells exert NK cell activity against A20. The elimination of NK 1.1-positive cells from the graft reduced the antileukemic activity of (C57xBalb)F1 marrow against A20 in vivo. After injection of WEHI-3 leukemia cells, syngeneic BMT cured most of the recipients (62%) and transplantation of (C57xBalb)F1 marrow provided no additional benefit. In contrast to unmanipulated Balb/c and (C57xBalb)F1 cells, which showed no NK activity against WEHI-3 in vitro, IL-2 treated effector cells were highly cytotoxic.

Residual tumor cells following high dose chemotherapy represent the most common treatment failure, resulting in frequent relapse following autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT) and even allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Graft vs leukemia (GVL) effects mediated by immunocompetent donor lymphocytes represent a major therapeutic potential of allogeneic BMT which results in reduced rate of relapse, especially when immune interactions between immunocompetent donor's T lymphocytes and host allogantigens is apparent, a reaction which might result in graft vs host disease (GVHD). Recent experiments in animal models of murine leukemias suggest that post-transplant immunotherapy may be successfully accomplished by lymphokine-mediated immunotherapy (LMI) and cell-mediated immunotherapy (CMI). Following allogeneic BMT, provided GVHD can be prevented by T-cell depletion, CMI may be amplified by repeated administration of immunocompetent donor's lymphocytes in graded increments following successful induction of chimerism and sustained hematopoiesis. GVL effects induced by CMI may be further potentiated by in-vivo administration of a short course of recombinant human interleukin-2 (rhIL2). Taken together, our data suggest that post-transplant immunotherapy by cytokines and adoptive cell therapy may successfully prevent relapse in patients at high-risk and even result in complete elimination of tumor cells following overt relapse.

Several components of p210bcr/abl are thought to be essential for its transforming activity: These include the constitutive tyrosine kinase activity of abl and the ability of the first exon for bcr both to specifically bind to abl's SH2 binding domain and possibly also to function as a novel type of serine kinase. Relatively little is yet known about what specific abnormalities in the regulatory pathways are caused by the altered tyrosine kinase activity of p210bcr/abl and other bcr/abl oncoproteins, but whatever its precise mode of action proves to be, p210bcr/abl presumably somehow changes the normal pattern of phosphorylation of key regulatory proteins in the signaling pathways so that the genes which normally direct the orderly sequence of proliferation and maturation of the myeloid progenitors are not properly regulated. The end results of this 'disregulation' are that there is asynchronous or discordant maturation; relative to comparable normal progenitors, a higher proportion of CML progenitors exhibit earlier cytoplasmic and delayed nuclear maturation. The leukemic progenitors do not proliferate more rapidly than comparable normal progenitors or have increased ultimate proliferative potential, but they go through one or more additional divisions during passage through the later maturation compartments and also live longer, resulting in overexpansion of the leukemic population. It is important to recognize the close linkage between maturation and proliferation in designing experiments to correlate the molecular and biological abnormalities and in seeking novel therapies to selectively affect the leukemic progenitors.","['Clarkson, B', 'Strife, A', 'Perez, A', 'Lambek, C', 'Wisniewski, D']","['Clarkson B', 'Strife A', 'Perez A', 'Lambek C', 'Wisniewski D']","['Sloan-Kettering Institute for Cancer Research Molecular Pharmacology and Therapeutics Program, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10021.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Separation', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/*pathology/therapy']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199309064267 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1993;11 Suppl 2:81-100. doi: 10.3109/10428199309064267.,"['0 (Interleukin-3)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",,,,"['NCI CA20194/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'NCI P30-CA-08748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Follow up remission BM samples were analysed in 22 patients during and after therapy (2-7 samples per patient), 1-50 months after presentation or relapse. In 1 relapsed case, previously stored complete remission (CR) samples were analysed retrospectively. Clonal IgH chain rearrangements were detected by PCR in 90% of patients studied initially. The 2 VH region families most commonly used were the large VH3 family (65%) and the smaller more JH-proximal VH4 family (22%). More than one VH clone was detectable in 25% of the cases. A gene ""fingerprinting"" modification of a previously described method was applied to the detection of minimal residual disease (MRD) in follow up BM samples with a sensitivity of 10(-3) to 10(-4). In 8 of 14 patients remaining in complete remission (CR) during the time of study, all PCR analyses on BM samples in the first 6 months were negative, in some cases as early as 2 weeks post-induction therapy, and a further patient reverted from being PCR positive in the first month after the commencement of therapy to sustained PCR negativity. One adult remains in CR at 50 months after presentation and has been PCR negative at 2 time points after cessation of maintenance therapy (30 and 50 months). Eight patients relapsed in the study period comprising 6 BM and 2 isolated CNS relapses. In 4 cases of BM relapse occurring within 7 months of the start of therapy, all BM remission samples tested in this period were PCR positive. In 2 other patients BM samples tested 7 and 2 months respectively prior to relapse were PCR negative. In the 2 patients with isolated CNS relapse, PCR of BM samples from 2 and 10 months before the relapse were negative.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Cole-Sinclair, M', 'Foroni, L', 'Wright, F', 'Mehta, A', 'Prentice, H G', 'Hoffbrand, A V']","['Cole-Sinclair M', 'Foroni L', 'Wright F', 'Mehta A', 'Prentice HG', 'Hoffbrand AV']","['Department of Haematology, Royal Free Hospital School of Medicine, London, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow/pathology/ultrastructure', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', '*Gene Rearrangement', '*Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/immunology/pathology']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199309064262 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1993;11 Suppl 2:49-58. doi: 10.3109/10428199309064262.,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, differently from the other AML subtypes, APL shows a high response rate to induction monochemotherapies with anthracycline drugs. This high response rate to anthracycline monochemotherapies is very peculiar of APL. Moreover, it has been suggested that maintenance treatment regimens incorporating the drugs Methotrexate and 6-Mercaptopurine, two drugs generally not utilized in the post-remission treatment of other AML subtypes, may be effective in prolonging the leukemia-free survival of APL. Furthermore, the results firstly obtained by a Chinese group in 1988 by using the vitamin A derivative all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) have been successively confirmed by several other groups in the world. Therefore, at present the all-trans retinoic acid appears to be the best CR inducer in APL. However, these CRs are short lasting when maintained with ATRA alone and eventually all patients relapse. As a consequence, patients achieving CR with ATRA still require intensive post-remission chemotherapy to maintain the CR. As for bone marrow transplantation procedures, it is our opinion that they do not represent the treatment of choice of APL in first CR considering the very good results obtained with standard pharmacological approaches. In conclusion, only future randomized prospective trials will clarify which, among the several proposed therapeutic approaches, should be preferred in this very peculiar subtype of AML.","['Avvisati, G', 'Petti, M C', 'Mandelli, F']","['Avvisati G', 'Petti MC', 'Mandelli F']","['Department of Human Biopathology, University La Sapienza, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/diagnosis/genetics/*therapy', 'Tretinoin/therapeutic use']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199309064259 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1993;11 Suppl 2:29-35. doi: 10.3109/10428199309064259.,['5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)'],,49,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Complete remissions (CR) were unusual with conventional approaches such as chlorambucil with or without prednisone or cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone (CVP). Pathologic complete remissions including negative bone marrow biopsies were seldom mentioned in the literature. Two parameter flow cytometry has demonstrated that CLL cells co-express CD5 and pan-B cell antigens such as CD19 and CD20. In addition, immunoglobulin gene rearrangement occurs predictably in B-cell CLL and can be used as a further marker of completeness of remission. The National Cancer Institute (NCI) has published criteria for complete remission which allow persistent lymphoid nodules to be present on the bone marrow biopsy and the patient can be considered in complete remission. Our group has considered these patients to have a nodular CR (Nod CR) to separate them from having a true remission on bone marrow biopsy (CR-bx). Thus bone marrow biopsy criteria, two parameter flow cytometry, and immunoglobulin gene rearrangement are now available for routine clinical application to re-define completeness of remission in CLL. With the use of fludarabine monophosphate (Fludara), complete and partial responses are obtained in 50-55% of previously treated patients with CLL and 75-80% of patients with previously untreated CLL. There was a strong correlation of probability of response with degree of previous therapy, stage of disease, age, hemoglobin level, platelet count, serum albumin and beta 2-microglobulin, and bone marrow infiltration with lymphocytes.

With cytomegalovirus (CMV), acquisition of exogenous virus by transfusion of blood products containing virus and from the bone marrow graft in the case of bone marrow transplantation can occur. Serious morbidity can result and occasional mortality. CMV infections in allogeneic BMT recipients have high case fatality rates. Treatment and preventive strategies for herpes simplex virus (HSV), CMV, and varicella zoster virus (VZV) have been developed to reduce morbidity. Acyclovir, either given prophylactically or as treatment of active infection, has been highly successful in reducing illness from HSV and VZV infection. For CMV, provision of CMV-seronegative blood products is the mainstay of prevention of morbidity in seronegative patients and is especially important in the care of patients undergoing allogeneic BMT. Ganciclovir given either prophylactically or as early therapy for patients detected to be shedding CMV appears to be a promising strategy.

Nevertheless, there is still a lack of definitive data concerning its real effectiveness in prolonging the survival of these patients. Between 1984 and 1992, 20 ALL patients in first, second and third complete remission (CR) underwent autografting in the BMT Unit of the University of Milan. This series included 3 children in CR after one or more hematological relapses while all the other patients were adult. Autologous bone marrow was harvested during the same disease phase as that in which the autologous BMT was performed. The conditioning regimen included high-dose Ara-C, cyclophosphamide and TBI 1000 cGy. Successful engraftment occurred in all patients; no early deaths or deaths in CR were recorded, making disease-free survival and event-free survival (EFS) curves superimposable. The overall chance of EFS at 72 months was 41%: 57% for patients in first CR, 53% for patients autografted after one or more isolated meningeal relapse, 14% for patients autografted after one or more hematological relapse. The present data do not provide any evidence to support a role for autologous BMT in prolonging EFS in first CR ALL patients. Nevertheless, the results after meningeal relapse seem to be favourable when compared with the disappointing prospects of these patients after conventional chemotherapy. The EFS after hematological relapse revealed by this study does not significantly differ from that reported in the majority of other studies: the efficacy of autologous BMT in these ALL patients is doubtful.","['Lambertenghi Deliliers, G', 'Mozzana, R', 'Annaloro, C', 'Butti, C', 'Della Volpe, A', 'Oriani, A', 'Pozzoli, E', 'Soligo, D', 'Polli, E E']","['Lambertenghi Deliliers G', 'Mozzana R', 'Annaloro C', 'Butti C', 'Della Volpe A', 'Oriani A', 'Pozzoli E', 'Soligo D', 'Polli EE']","['Centro Trapianti di Midollo, University of Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/mortality/*therapy', 'Survival Rate', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",1993/11/01 00:00,1993/11/01 00:01,['1993/11/01 00:00'],"['1993/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199309067935 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1993 Nov;11(5-6):419-25. doi: 10.3109/10428199309067935.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to provide arguments supporting such a role, the intratumoral production of IL-6 was studied by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry in 53 neoplastic tissues from B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia or B lymphomas. IL-6-producing cells were detected in all samples but 5. However, the number of IL-6 producing cells was variable amongst the different cases. Increased density of IL-6-producing cells was highly dependent on the presence of malignant immunoblasts within the neoplastic clone. IL-6 was produced in a paracrine way, macrophages and endothelial cells being the main producers of the cytokine while malignant immunoblasts expressed the IL-6 receptor. Taken together, these results suggest that IL-6 may indeed act as a growth factor for malignant cells in some B lymphoproliferations and that this paracrine loop could be the target of new therapeutic approaches.","['Emilie, D', 'Leger-Ravet, M B', 'Devergne, O', 'Raphael, M', 'Peuchmaur, M', 'Coumbaras, J', 'Crevon, M C', 'Galanaud, P']","['Emilie D', 'Leger-Ravet MB', 'Devergne O', 'Raphael M', 'Peuchmaur M', 'Coumbaras J', 'Crevon MC', 'Galanaud P']","['INSERM U131, Clamart, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*metabolism', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin/analysis', 'Receptors, Interleukin-6']",1993/11/01 00:00,1993/11/01 00:01,['1993/11/01 00:00'],"['1993/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199309067934 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1993 Nov;11(5-6):411-7. doi: 10.3109/10428199309067934.,"['0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-6)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Considerable numbers of patients with MDS eventually develop acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), which is very much more difficult to manage than typical denovo AML. There are several differences in both the clinical and biological behavior of AML with and without prior MDS. We have established an unique long-term bone marrow culture (LTBMC) system which allows abnormal cells to grow in preference to normal cells, based on the method originally described by Dexter et al. Leukemic transformations occur more frequently in MDS patients with abnormal karyotypes, and particularly those with multiple abnormalities. New cytogenetic abnormalities were occasionally observed at the time of transition to AML. We have applied this LTBMC system for cytogenetic and molecular studies on the leukemic transformation from MDS. Among the 32 patients with MDS studied thus far, novel abnormal karyotypes were detected during the LTBMCs in 15 patients. Furthermore, 6 out of 23 novel karyotypes detected during the in-vitro cultures emerged in vivo, one to 11 months later in 4 patients. In addition, point mutation of the N-ras proto-oncogene was observed in 3 of 18 cases. The signal of the dot-blot hybridization was increased in one examined case after 2 weeks in culture.

We studied the effects of BZ and hydroquinone (HQ), a toxic bone marrow metabolite, on the human HL-60 promyelocytic leukemic cell line. Because the HL-60 cell is bipotential and can be induced to differentiate to monocytes or granulocytes it has been used in many studies as a surrogate for the granulocyte/macrophage committed cell, GM-CFU. Treatment of HL-60 cells with BZ specifically induced differentiation along the granulocytic lineage as measured by morphology, induction of superoxide production and chloroacetate esterase activity and the appearance of the L12-2 surface antigen. Differentiation was induced via the activation of protein kinase C and the phosphorylation of several proteins known to be involved in HL-60 cell differentiation. Subsequent to kinase C activation, arachidonic acid was released from membrane phospholipids and the 5-lipoxygenase pathway was activated for the production of leukotriene D4 (LTD4) required for granulocytic differentiation. BZ induction of granulopoiesis was prevented by preincubation of HL-60 cells with inhibitors of protein kinase C, 5-lipoxygenase, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase required for the conversion of LTC4 to LTD4, or LTD4 receptor antagonists.

Remission BM was purged in vitro using monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs; PM-81, AML-2-23) and complement targeting myeloid differentiation antigens (CD15, CD14). In 1988, the preparative regimen changed from 60 mg/kg/d cyclophosphamide x 2 and fractionated total body irradiation (TBI) total dose, 1,200 cGy (Cy/fTBI), to 4 mg/kg/d busulfan x 4 and 60 mg/kg/d Cy x 2 (Bu/Cy2). Recent analysis (October 1, 1993) shows that the Bu/Cy2 regimen along with the same MoAb purging method yields an improved outcome. Seven first complete-remission (CR) (CR1), 45 second- or third-CR (CR2/3), and 11 first-relapse (R1) patients were treated with chemotherapy and TBI or chemotherapy alone followed by ABMT with MoAb-purged BM.

Moreover, rhIL-6 treatment produced significant improvement of survival in lethally irradiated mice receiving either syngeneic or semiallogeneic BMT with limiting number of BM cells. This effect of IL-6 was not seen with large BM cell inocula producing high survival by themselves. rhIL-6 showed no toxic effects and did not affect the survival of mice that were lethally irradiated but not reconstituted by BM cells. However, the sensitivity of mice to sublethal irradiation was increased by rhIL-6 in the absence of BM cell transplantation. In experimental conditions inducing graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), in which lethally irradiated (BALB/c x C57BL/6)F1 mice received mixtures of BM and spleen cells from C57BL/6 donors, rhIL-6 was found to enhance GVHD manifestations. No consistent enhancement of T-cell in vitro proliferative responses to allogeneic spleen cells or T- and B-cell-dependent mitogens were seen in the splenocytes obtained from recipients of syngeneic or semiallogeneic BMT. Our data suggest that rhIL-6 may be useful in BMT procedures to enhance thrombopoiesis and hematologic recovery, as well as to increase overall survival rates. In addition, the potentiation of GVHD, which is considered to correlate with graft-versus-leukemia effects, may be of interest in enhancing GVHD-dependent antitumor effects in protocols combining radiochemotherapy with BMT.","['Givon, T', 'Revel, M', 'Slavin, S']","['Givon T', 'Revel M', 'Slavin S']","['Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation, Hadassah University Hospital, Jerusalem, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Animals', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation/mortality', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', 'Hematopoiesis/drug effects', 'Interleukin-6/*therapeutic use', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Recombinant Proteins/therapeutic use', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Transplantation, Isogeneic', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",1994/03/15 00:00,1994/03/15 00:01,['1994/03/15 00:00'],"['1994/03/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/03/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/03/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)77048-5 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1994 Mar 15;83(6):1690-7.,"['0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DR cells lack erythroid-specific delta-aminolevulinate (ALA) synthase (AL-AS-E), and fail to undergo erythroid differentiation following treatment with DMSO. Treatment of cells with DMSO markedly increased ALAS-E mRNA in DS cells, while the same treatment downregulated the nonspecific ALA synthase (ALAS-N) mRNA levels in both DS and DR cells. The levels of beta-globin mRNA, heme content, and hemoglobin in DS cells increased, while those in DR cells decreased following treatment with DMSO. Treatment of DR cells with hemin caused an increase in beta-globin mRNA and hemoglobin, and partially restored the DMSO-mediated suppression of beta-globin mRNA and hemoglobin synthesis. DMSO treatment decreased heme oxygenase (HO) mRNA in hemin-treated DS cells, but not in hemin-treated DR cells. These findings indicate that heme is necessary for accumulation of the beta-globin transcript during erythroid differentiation, and that hemin-mediated HO induction becomes markedly downregulated in differentiated erythroid cells, presumably because less free heme is available for HO induction by a greater demand for the synthesis of hemoglobin.","['Fukuda, Y', 'Fujita, H', 'Garbaczewski, L', 'Sassa, S']","['Fukuda Y', 'Fujita H', 'Garbaczewski L', 'Sassa S']","['Rockefeller University, New York, NY 10021.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['5-Aminolevulinate Synthetase/genetics', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/*pharmacology', 'Globins/*genetics', 'Heme/analysis/*physiology', 'Heme Oxygenase (Decyclizing)/genetics', 'Hemin/pharmacology', 'Hemoglobins/analysis', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'RNA, Messenger/*analysis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/03/15 00:00,1994/03/15 00:01,['1994/03/15 00:00'],"['1994/03/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/03/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/03/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)77044-8 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1994 Mar 15;83(6):1662-7.,"['0 (Hemoglobins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '42VZT0U6YR (Heme)', '743LRP9S7N (Hemin)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', 'EC 1.14.14.18 (Heme Oxygenase (Decyclizing))', 'EC 2.3.1.37 (5-Aminolevulinate Synthetase)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",,,,['DK-32890/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We verified the prognosis of this subtype by analyzing the results of 189 consecutive patients with de novo AML. Fifteen cases fitting the criteria of AML-M0 were identified. No clinical features distinguished them from other patients with AML. The median age was 61 years (range 27 to 70), with a leukocyte count ranging from 0.6 to 185 x 10(9)/L. In all cases the leukemic cells expressed CD34 and reacted with at least one of the antibodies to early myeloid antigens, ie, CD13, CD33, or myeloperoxidase. Immunophenotypic analysis also showed positivity for CD7 in seven samples and the multidrug-resistance P-glycoprotein (P-170) in six. Cytogenetic analysis was abnormal in 12 of the 13 patients in whom an adequate number of mitoses could be evaluated. No single abnormality prevailed, the most common findings being trisomy 8 (three cases) and aberrations of chromosome 7 (two cases). Antileukemic treatment differed according to age, but for remission induction, all patients received a combination of cytosine arabinoside and an anthracycline or mitoxantrone. The prognosis of patients with AML-M0 was remarkably poor as compared with the other French-American-British subtypes. Whereas the overall rate of complete remission (CR) was 58% with a median survival of 63 weeks, only 6 of the 15 patients with AML-M0 achieved a CR, and the median survival of this group was 16 weeks (range 3 to 39). The major determinant of treatment failure was unresponsiveness to chemotherapy, as only one patient died of infection during the hypoplastic phase. The CR duration of responders was short, ranging from 3 to 22 weeks, and no second remissions were observed. We conclude that conventional combination chemotherapy yields disappointing results in AML-M0. The reason for this may be the convergence of various unfavorable prognostic factors, such as (1) the high incidence of cytogenetic abnormalities; (2) the lack of differentiation features and the expression of immaturity markers such as CD34 and CD7; and (3) the frequent expression of P-170. Nonconventional therapeutic approaches should be developed to alter the prognosis of this form of leukemia.","['Stasi, R', 'Del Poeta, G', 'Venditti, A', 'Masi, M', 'Stipa, E', 'Dentamaro, T', 'Cox, C', 'Dallapiccola, B', 'Papa, G']","['Stasi R', 'Del Poeta G', 'Venditti A', 'Masi M', 'Stipa E', 'Dentamaro T', 'Cox C', 'Dallapiccola B', 'Papa G']","['Division of Hematology, University of Rome Tor Vergata, S.

Despite these observations, little is known about the clinical importance of ras mutations in AML. We studied the clinical impact of ras mutations in 99 patients with de novo AML. All patients were treated in two prospective multicenter trials. The polymerase chain reaction was used to amplify areas surrounding the codons 12, 13, and 61 of the three ras genes N-, K-, and H-ras from DNA from bone marrow cells, ras mutations were detected by an algorithm based on allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization. Eighteen of 99 (18%) patients harbored mutations in either N- or K-ras. All of the observed mutations occurred in N-ras (N = 10) and K-ras (N = 5) or concurrently in both N- and K-ras (N = 3). There were no significant differences between ras-negative and ras-positive patients according to age, sex, blood counts, cytogenetic abnormalities, or French-American-British classification. However, univariate analysis suggested a longer survival in ras-positive patients (P = .11). When adjusted for age, which was the most important factor affecting outcome, the presence of a ras mutation emerged as a significant predictor for improved survival (P = .03) and along with lower bone marrow blast counts (P = .02) and better cytogenetic category (P = .01). However, the presence of an aberrant ras allele was strongly correlated with lower bone marrow blast counts (P = .007). Thus, whether a mutation in the N-ras or K-ras proto-oncogenes directly affects treatment outcome or indirectly through an association with lower leukemic burden remains to be determined. Nevertheless, these findings counter the prevailing bias that oncogene mutations lead to more aggressive behavior in human malignancies.","['Neubauer, A', 'Dodge, R K', 'George, S L', 'Davey, F R', 'Silver, R T', 'Schiffer, C A', 'Mayer, R J', 'Ball, E D', 'Wurster-Hill, D', 'Bloomfield, C D']","['Neubauer A', 'Dodge RK', 'George SL', 'Davey FR', 'Silver RT', 'Schiffer CA', 'Mayer RJ', 'Ball ED', 'Wurster-Hill D', 'Bloomfield CD', 'et al.']","['Department of Medicine, Lineberger Cancer Research Center, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill 27599-7295.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', '*Genes, ras', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Rate']",1994/03/15 00:00,1994/03/15 00:01,['1994/03/15 00:00'],"['1994/03/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/03/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/03/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)77036-9 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1994 Mar 15;83(6):1603-11.,,,,,"['CA-37027/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA47545-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA49240-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",['ras'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

To identify matrix constituents that could be involved in the tissue dissemination of neoplastic B cells, we have examined the ability of three lymphoma B-cell lines and one Philadelphia chromosome (Ph1)-positive cell line established from the lymphoid transformation of a chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) to adhere to a range of purified ECM molecules. Immunophenotyping with a panel of markers suggested that the lines derived from cells that had undergone transformation at distinct stages of B-cell maturation. The four cell lines displayed a differential ability to adhere to the ECM molecules tested. BV-173, Ci-1, and Sc-1 cells attached to various degrees to fibronectin (FN). Ri-1, Ci-1, and Sc-1 cells attached to human laminin (LN) variants, whereas only Ci-1 and Sc-1 cells showed some affinity for collagen (Col) type VI. All four cell lines interacted with fibrillar Col I, but only BV-173 and Ri-1 cells attached to fibrillar Col III. The subendothelial Col VIII only was active as a substratum for BV-173 cells. In all cases, cells bound to fibrillar collagens when they were assembled into polymeric fibrils, and were incapable of adhering to monomeric and denatured collagen. In contrast to cell adhesion to FN and LN, which showed a plateau at high substrate concentrations, adhesion to fibrillar Col I reached a peak at intermediary concentrations and decreased thereafter, suggesting that cells respond to a definite macromolecular arrangement of collagenous fibrils. Adhesion to individual ECM molecules was not directly correlated with the apparent maturation state of the cells, nor with the relative density of known ECM receptors.

Early after infection, four factor-independent clones were isolated and analyzed in greater detail along with mass populations obtained from separate infections. High levels of P210 tyrosine kinase activity were measured in the factor-independent cells. The mass populations and three of the four clones remained responsive to exogenous growth factors. Concentrated conditioned media isolated from the factor-independent populations and from all clones contained biologically active granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF); interleukin-3 (IL-3) was detected at low levels in the mass population and in two of the clones. Neutralizing antibodies to IL-3, GM-CSF, and mast cell growth factor inhibited proliferation of the factor responsive clones by 60% to 90%. These results indicate that the growth autonomy of the P210-expressing M07E cells was acquired via an autocrine mechanism. In addition to factor-independent growth, P210-expressing M07E cells readily acquired a more mature megakaryocytic phenotype compared with control M07E cells. These data provide experimental evidence that expression of P210 tyrosine kinase in human hematopoietic cells induced growth factor secretion resulting in a pleiotropic effect on growth factor dependence and differentiation.","['Sirard, C', 'Laneuville, P', 'Dick, J E']","['Sirard C', 'Laneuville P', 'Dick JE']","['Department of Genetics, Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*analysis', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/analysis/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/analysis/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/pathology']",1994/03/15 00:00,1994/03/15 00:01,['1994/03/15 00:00'],"['1994/03/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/03/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/03/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)77033-3 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1994 Mar 15;83(6):1575-85.,"['0 (Interleukin-3)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, NGF induced autophosphorylation of TrkA and could substitute for granulocyte-monocyte colony-stimulating factor to trigger the proliferation of the TF1 cell line, with a half-maximal signal observed at 50 pmol/L, indicating that p75 is not required for DNA synthesis in this cell line. The physiologic relevance of NGF in early hematopoiesis was confirmed by showing that 12% to 15% of progenitor blood cells from mice treated with 5-fluorouracil expressed TrkA and that these cells could be induced to proliferate and differentiate in response to NGF in association with macrophage colony-stimulating factor.

The present work reports the chromosomal abnormalities observed in 39 patients with chronic myelocytic leukemia, studied at the Genetic Unit, in the Faculty of Medicine of Zulia University, during the period from 1987 to 1991. Sixty per cent of the patients showed different abnormalities, such as 8 trisomy, t (8;22), and in the remaining 15%, no chromosomal changes were detected. The patients with t (9;22) as the only abnormality, had less relapses and longer survival. The clinical course of 50% of the patients with normal karyotype was similar to those with t (9;22) as the only abnormality; the other 50% had an accelerated course with frequent relapses and early death. The present findings confirm that the presence of the Philadelphia chromosome as the only karyotypical abnormality, is indicative of better prognosis, and its association with other chromosomal changes predicts a more accelerated course that will probably require a more aggressive treatment.","['Rojas-Atencio, A', 'Roldan-Paris, L', 'Pineda-Del Villar, L', 'Herrera, N', 'Herrera, A']","['Rojas-Atencio A', 'Roldan-Paris L', 'Pineda-Del Villar L', 'Herrera N', 'Herrera A']","['Unidad de Genetica Medica, Universidad del Zulia, Maracaibo, Venezuela.']",['spa'],"['Comparative Study', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Venezuela,Invest Clin,Investigacion clinica,0421531,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aneuploidy', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/epidemiology/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prevalence', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Analysis']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Invest Clin. 1993;34(2):75-83.,,,,,,,Importancia de las alteraciones cromosomicas en la leucemia mieloide cronica.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently wild-type p53 has been shown to exist in two interchangeable conformational variants, which can be distinguished by specific p53 monoclonal antibodies. One conformation acts as a suppressor (PAb240-/PAb1620+) and one acts as a promoter (PAb240+/PAb1620-) of cell proliferation; the latter conformation is also that of mutant p53. We have previously shown that acute myeloblastic leukaemia (AML) blasts which proliferate autonomously in vitro express only p53 in the promoter conformation. In contrast, expression of PAb1620 was found only in blasts with non-autocrine growth in vitro and was diminished following stimulation by exogenous growth factors when there was a switch to p53 in the promoter (PAb240+) conformation. As AML blasts with non-autocrine growth undergo apoptosis when deprived of exogenous growth factors, we studied whether this was mediated by wild-type p53. Antisense oligonucleotides to p53 were used to suppress p53 protein expression in blasts with non-autocrine growth and also the factor-dependent human erythroleukaemia cell line TF-1. Following growth factor deprivation for 48 h, 20.6-53.6% of control blasts were apoptotic and demonstrated a typical 'ladder' on DNA electrophoresis characteristic of internucleosomal degradation of DNA. In the presence of p53 antisense, apoptosis was suppressed despite the absence of growth factor, however cell proliferation was not stimulated. We conclude that apoptosis occurring in factor-dependent AML blasts following growth factor deprivation is mediated by wild-type p53 (PAb1620+), and that conformational change of p53 to the PAb240+ conformation occurring either by mutation or by the action of autocrine growth factors would permit leukaemic cell survival by suppressing apoptosis.","['Zhu, Y M', 'Bradbury, D A', 'Russell, N H']","['Zhu YM', 'Bradbury DA', 'Russell NH']","['Department of Haematology, Nottingham City Hospital, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Base Sequence', 'Blast Crisis/blood/genetics/pathology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/blood/isolation & purification', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression', '*Genes, p53', 'Growth Substances/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/*genetics/*pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/pharmacology', 'Protein Conformation', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/analysis/biosynthesis/chemistry']",1994/03/01 00:00,1994/03/01 00:01,['1994/03/01 00:00'],"['1994/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/bjc.1994.85 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1994 Mar;69(3):468-72. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1994.85.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",,,,,['p53'],,,PMC1968850,,,,,,,,,,

Understanding the cellular pharmacology of MTX and other antifolates has provided a strong rationale for the use of high-dose MTX with leucovorin (LV) rescue. The combination of MTX and LV prevents severe toxicity without diminishing the antitumor activity of the drugs. The efficacy of antifolate drugs is related to the extent of intracellular polyglutamation in normal and cancer cells. Since toxicity in patients is difficult to predict, monitoring drug concentrations is critical. Antifolates, specifically MTX and edatrexate, are among a growing class of chemotherapeutic agents that require assiduous and rapid monitoring to help prevent severe systemic toxicity.

The present follow-up covers 1448 years/patient. Maintenance therapy was seldom discontinued because of blood toxicity or gastrointestinal intolerance, but it was stopped in 20 percent of the cases because monitoring was difficult in very old patients. Maintenance therapy reduced the mean annual 32P dose by at least 50 percent. However, the actual risk of malignant blood diseases (myelodysplasia, acute leukaemia, lymphoma) was similar in the two arms of the protocol: 14 percent at the 10th year. Compared with the French population of the same age-groups, there was no excess of epithelial cancers in both arms. Maintenance therapy did not control platelet counts perfectly. The risk of severe vascular events was identical in both arms; probably no higher than expected at that age and significantly lower than in previously published data. The actuarial survival curves in both groups showed a 50 percent survival of about 11 years, i.e. very near to that of the reference French population (12.5 years) of similar sex and age.","['Najean, Y', 'Rain, J D', 'Toubert, M E']","['Najean Y', 'Rain JD', 'Toubert ME']","['Service de Medecine nucleaire, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris.']",['fre'],"['Clinical Trial', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",France,Presse Med,"Presse medicale (Paris, France : 1983)",8302490,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Carcinoma/etiology', 'Cardiovascular Diseases/*etiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Injections, Intravenous', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/etiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/etiology', 'Phosphorus Radioisotopes/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Polycythemia/complications/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/etiology', 'Risk Factors']",1993/12/11 00:00,1993/12/11 00:01,['1993/12/11 00:00'],"['1993/12/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/12/11 00:01 [medline]', '1993/12/11 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Presse Med. 1993 Dec 11;22(39):1951-6.,"['0 (Phosphorus Radioisotopes)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",,,,,,Traitement des polyglobulies par 32P avec ou sans traitement d'entretien par hydroxyuree.

Using a photocrosslinking technique, our laboratory has previously defined three cytoplasmic RNA-binding activities specific for the AUUUA multimers found in the 3'-untranslated regions of lymphokine mRNAs. One of these activities, AU-A, has an apparent molecular mass of 34 kDa, is constitutively expressed in both primary T cells and the Jurkat T cell leukemia line, and binds to a variety of U-rich RNA sequences. Previous studies had shown that AU-A is more prevalent in the nucleus than the cytoplasm, raising the possibility that AU-A is really a nuclear RNA-binding activity that is found in cytoplasmic extracts because of nuclear leakage during cell fractionation. We now show that AU-A shuttles between the cytoplasm and the nucleus. Our results indicate that AU-A is a candidate protein component of ribonucleoprotein complexes that participate in nucleocytoplasmic transport of mRNA and cytoplasmic mRNA metabolism. The properties of AU-A activity are similar to those of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNP A1). However, using monoclonal antibodies to hnRNP A1 and protease digestion patterns, we show that AU-A activity and hnRNP A1 protein are distinct. These studies have also allowed us to define a fourth RNA-binding activity of apparent molecular mass 41 kDa with specificity for AUUUA multimers. This activity is restricted to the nucleus and contains the hnRNP C protein.","['Katz, D A', 'Theodorakis, N G', 'Cleveland, D W', 'Lindsten, T', 'Thompson, C B']","['Katz DA', 'Theodorakis NG', 'Cleveland DW', 'Lindsten T', 'Thompson CB']","['Department of Molecular Genetics and Cell Biology, University of Chicago, IL 60637.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Nucleic Acids Res,Nucleic acids research,0411011,IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Biological Transport', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', 'Cytoplasm/*metabolism', 'Heterogeneous Nuclear Ribonucleoprotein A1', '*Heterogeneous-Nuclear Ribonucleoprotein Group A-B', 'Heterogeneous-Nuclear Ribonucleoprotein Group C', 'Heterogeneous-Nuclear Ribonucleoproteins', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Molecular Weight', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Ribonucleoproteins/*metabolism']",1994/01/25 00:00,1994/01/25 00:01,['1994/01/25 00:00'],"['1994/01/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/25 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/nar/22.2.238 [doi]'],ppublish,Nucleic Acids Res. 1994 Jan 25;22(2):238-46. doi: 10.1093/nar/22.2.238.,"['0 (Heterogeneous Nuclear Ribonucleoprotein A1)', '0 (Heterogeneous-Nuclear Ribonucleoprotein Group A-B)', '0 (Heterogeneous-Nuclear Ribonucleoprotein Group C)', '0 (Heterogeneous-Nuclear Ribonucleoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Ribonucleoproteins)']",,,,['CA54521/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,PMC307777,,,,,,,,,,

An alternative approach to passive serotherapy is targeting cell surface growth factor receptors with monoclonal antibodies. With some limitations, anti-growth factor receptor antibodies can limit cell growth by blocking stimulatory or trophic growth factor receptors and by marshaling in vivo antitumor immune responses. PURPOSE: The purpose of our study was to determine the extent to which anti-interleukin-6 (IL-6) and anti-transferrin (Tf) receptor antibodies, when used individually or combined, could limit myeloma cell growth. METHODS: The four myeloma cell lines studied varied in IL-6 responses from factor independence (myeloma cell lines 8226 and U266) to strict factor dependence (OCI-My4 myeloma cells and human acute myelogenous leukemia [AML] cell line UCSD/AML1). IL-6 RNA was detected using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. IL-6 protein was detected in U266 supernatant by growth stimulation of UCSD/AML1 cells and by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. For cell growth assays, cell lines were plated with various concentrations of IL-6 and anti-receptor antibodies and [3H]thymidine uptake determined after 3 days. Cells were grown in varying concentrations of IgG1 monoclonal anti-Tf receptor antibodies E2.3 and A27.15 or antibodies PM1, AUK 146-15, AUK 64-7, or AUK 12-20 to the human IL-6 receptor-alpha protein. Tf and IL-6 receptors were detected by immunofluorescence staining. RESULTS: Using short-term proliferation assays, anti-Tf receptors and anti-IL-6 antibodies caused dose-dependent growth inhibition of varying degrees, and, in one of three cell lines, a combination of anti-Tf and anti-IL-6 antibodies showed supra-additive growth inhibition. IL-6-independent cells were inhibited by anti-Tf receptor antibodies, while IL-6-dependent cells were resistant to these antibodies but sensitive to anti-IL-6 receptor. Factor-dependent myeloma cells exposed to either anti-Tf or anti-IL-6 receptor antibodies for 48 hours lost colony-forming capability. A combination of anti-Tf and anti-IL-6 antibodies increased elimination of colony-forming cells at 24 hours. CONCLUSIONS: Anti-receptor antibodies have distinct patterns of myeloma cell growth inhibition and inhibit in vitro growth of factor-dependent myeloma cells. Combinations of anti-growth factor receptor antibodies also increase toxicity for IL-6-dependent myeloma colony-forming units.","['Taetle, R', 'Dos Santos, B', 'Ohsugi, Y', 'Koishihara, Y', 'Yamada, Y', 'Messner, H', 'Dalton, W']","['Taetle R', 'Dos Santos B', 'Ohsugi Y', 'Koishihara Y', 'Yamada Y', 'Messner H', 'Dalton W']","['Arizona Cancer Center, Tucson 85724.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/pharmacology', 'Multiple Myeloma/*pathology', 'Receptors, Interleukin/analysis/*immunology/physiology', 'Receptors, Transferrin/analysis/*immunology/physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1994/03/16 00:00,1994/03/16 00:01,['1994/03/16 00:00'],"['1994/03/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/03/16 00:01 [medline]', '1994/03/16 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/jnci/86.6.450 [doi]'],ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1994 Mar 16;86(6):450-5. doi: 10.1093/jnci/86.6.450.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)']",,,,"['CA37641/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA43043/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Following another period of hydration, 500 mg/m2 of Ara-C was administered by continuous intravenous infusion daily for 4 days. In 17 children, plasma concentrations of 6MP were measured at hours 4, 24, and 27 of the 6MP infusions. Plasma concentrations of Ara-C were measured at hours 8, 24, 48, 72, and 96 of the Ara-C infusions. Intracellular Ara-C triphosphate (Ara-CTP) concentrations were measured in peripheral-blood leukemia cells of the five patients with sufficient cells for measurement. Children who developed remission received repeated courses of this regimen every 3 to 4 weeks until relapse or completion of 12 courses. RESULTS: Of 13 children with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), six developed complete remissions (CRs) lasting 7 months to nearly 4 years. Two children remain in CR with normal growth, development, and health 3 years after cessation of treatment. Of 10 children with acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL), one had a CR of 2 months' duration. Dose-limiting toxicity consisted of severe hematosuppression with fever, neutropenia, and serious infection. There were two toxic deaths. The mean steady-state plasma concentrations of 6MP were approximately 4 mumol/L and of Ara-C approximately 3 mumol/L. The median Ara-CTP concentration in peripheral-blood leukemia cells was 308 mumol/L at hour 8 of the Ara-C infusion. CONCLUSION: High-dose continuous intravenous 6MP followed by intermediate-dose intravenous Ara-C produced CRs of longer than 6 months in approximately half of children with relapsed or unresponsive AML. Further study of this drug regimen is justified.","['Lockhart, S', 'Plunkett, W', 'Jeha, S', 'Ramirez, I', 'Zipf, T', 'Cork, A', 'Pinkel, D']","['Lockhart S', 'Plunkett W', 'Jeha S', 'Ramirez I', 'Zipf T', 'Cork A', 'Pinkel D']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/administration & dosage', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Treatment Outcome']",1994/03/01 00:00,1994/03/01 00:01,['1994/03/01 00:00'],"['1994/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1994.12.3.587 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1994 Mar;12(3):587-95. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1994.12.3.587.,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)']",,,,['CA 32839/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 15 adults with relapsed or refractory CLL or low-grade lymphoma were to receive chlorambucil orally (30 mg/m2) every 2 weeks. Also, groups of three patients were to receive escalating doses of continuous intravenously administered 2-CdA at 1, 2, or 4 mg/m2/d for 7 days repeated at monthly intervals. All patients had pharmacokinetic studies during the first cycle of 2-CdA therapy; the results were compared with other institutional phase I studies in which comparable amounts of 2-CdA were administered by bolus infusion for 5 days. RESULTS: The maximal-tolerated dose of 2-CdA that could be combined with chlorambucil was 2 mg/m2/d for 7 days for a maximum of two courses. At a higher dose level of 2-CdA or at the maximal-tolerated dose level given for more than two courses, severe and protracted pancytopenia, sometimes associated with life-threatening infections, was noted. Nonhematologic toxicities were limited to moderate degrees of nausea, vomiting, anorexia, and fatigue. Results of the pharmacologic studies suggested that 2-CdA clearance was independent of administration schedule and was unaffected by concomitant administration of chlorambucil. CONCLUSION: These observations suggest the possibility of combining two cycles of continuous intravenously administered 2-CdA (2 mg/m2/d for 7 days) with standard doses of oral chlorambucil to test the efficacy of the combination regimen in phase II trials.","['Tefferi, A', 'Witzig, T E', 'Reid, J M', 'Li, C Y', 'Ames, M M']","['Tefferi A', 'Witzig TE', 'Reid JM', 'Li CY', 'Ames MM']","['Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['2-Chloroadenosine/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Chlorambucil/administration & dosage', 'Deoxyadenosines/administration & dosage', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Treatment Outcome']",1994/03/01 00:00,1994/03/01 00:01,['1994/03/01 00:00'],"['1994/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1994.12.3.569 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1994 Mar;12(3):569-74. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1994.12.3.569.,"['0 (Deoxyadenosines)', '146-77-0 (2-Chloroadenosine)', '18D0SL7309 (Chlorambucil)', ""JYW18Y92UP (2-chloro-3'-deoxyadenosine)""]",,,,"['CA-15083/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'M-00585/PHS HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study in which the ""subjects"" were computerised linked records. SETTING: Six districts in the Oxford Regional Health Authority area (covering a population of 1.9 million people). SUBJECTS: Linked abstracts of hospital records and death certificates for people who died within four weeks and, for some diseases, within one year of hospital admission. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The percentage of people with each disease for whom the disease was recorded as the underlying cause of death, was recorded elsewhere on the death certificate, or was not certified as a cause of death at all. RESULTS: Three broad patterns of certification are distinguished. Firstly, there were diseases that were usually recorded on death certificates when death occurred within four weeks of hospital care of them. Examples included lung cancer (on 91% of such death certificates), breast cancer (92%), leukaemia and lymphoma (90%), anterior horn cell disease (89%), multiple sclerosis (89%), myocardial infarction (90%), stroke (93%), aortic aneurysm (87%), and spina bifida (89%). These diseases were also usually certified as the underlying cause of death. Secondly, there were diseases which, when present within four weeks of death, were commonly recorded on death certificates but often not as the underlying cause of death. Examples included tuberculosis (on 76% of such certificates; underlying cause on 54%), thyroid disease (49%; 21%), diabetes mellitus (69%; 30%) and hypertension (43%; 22%). Thirdly, there were conditions which, when death occurred within four weeks of their treatment, were recorded on the death certificate in a minority of cases only. Examples of these included fractured neck of femur (on 25% of such certificates), asthma (37%), and anaemia (22%). Not surprisingly, there was ""convergence"" in certification practice towards the common cardiovascular and respiratory causes of death. There was also evidence that conditions regarded as avoidable causes of death may not have been certified when present at death in some patients. CONCLUSION: When uses are made of mortality statistics alone, it is important to know which category of certification practice the disease of interest is likely to be in. Linkage between morbidity and mortality records, and multiple cause analysis of mortality, would considerably improve the ability to quantify mortality associated with individual diseases.","['Goldacre, M J']",['Goldacre MJ'],"['Department of Public Health and Primary Care, University of Oxford.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Epidemiol Community Health,Journal of epidemiology and community health,7909766,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', '*Cause of Death', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Death Certificates', 'England', 'Female', 'Hospitalization', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Medical Record Linkage', 'Middle Aged', 'Morbidity', 'Retrospective Studies']",1993/12/01 00:00,1993/12/01 00:01,['1993/12/01 00:00'],"['1993/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/jech.47.6.491 [doi]'],ppublish,J Epidemiol Community Health. 1993 Dec;47(6):491-6. doi: 10.1136/jech.47.6.491.,,,,,,,,,PMC1059865,,,,,,,,,,

Although small amounts of CA activity in PMNs have been reported, it has not been characterized fully. We therefore studied isolated mature circulating human PMNs and cultured HL-60 cells, an undifferentiated myelopoietic cell line, and compared these to human red cells (RBCs) for CA activity. Activity and sulfonamide inhibition were measured by a modified micromethod assay. Isoenzyme and total CA concentrations were determined by radioimmunoassay for human isozyme CA I, differential inhibition by MK-927, inhibition by 0.2% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), and quantitative sulfonamide binding. Total CA activity (units/10(6) cells) was 0.04 in PMNs, 0.06 in HL-60 cells, and 0.62 in RBCs. Human PMNs have a total CA concentration of 1.3 microM, of which 0.9 microM is CA I and the remainder is CA II. Total loss of CA activity with 100 microM ethoxzolamide and 0.2% SDS ruled out significant CA III or CA IV activity. Subcellular fractionation of PMNs revealed that all CA activity was cytosolic. The absence of CA activity in mitochondrial and microsomal membrane fractions argues against any mitochondrial CA V or membrane-bound CA IV contribution to total CA activity. Neutrophils contain both CA I and II isozymes in roughly the same proportion as RBCs but at much lower concentrations, suggesting that in the course of maturation the CA content of neutrophils is regulated differently from that in erythrocytes.","['Campbell, A R', 'Andress, D L', 'Swenson, E R']","['Campbell AR', 'Andress DL', 'Swenson ER']","['Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, University of Washington, Seattle.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,IM,"['Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Carbonic Anhydrases/*analysis/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Erythrocytes/cytology/enzymology', 'Ethoxzolamide/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Isoenzymes', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/pathology', 'Neutrophils/cytology/*enzymology', 'Radioimmunoassay', 'Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate/pharmacology', 'Sulfonamides/pharmacology', 'Thiophenes/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/03/01 00:00,1994/03/01 00:01,['1994/03/01 00:00'],"['1994/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jlb.55.3.343 [doi]'],ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 1994 Mar;55(3):343-8. doi: 10.1002/jlb.55.3.343.,"['0 (Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (Thiophenes)', '368GB5141J (Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate)', 'EC 4.2.1.1 (Carbonic Anhydrases)', 'FC9C0XB7D4 (sezolamide)', 'Z52H4811WX (Ethoxzolamide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Successful entry of the antibodies was determined by flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy. Permeabilized cells showed typical large granular lymphocyte morphology and remained functional, significantly lysing both NK-sensitive K562 cells and NK-resistant/IANK-sensitive RAJI target cells. This method was utilized to study the effect of anti-G protein antibodies on the functional activities of IANK cells. Anti-Gs antibody inhibited IANK cell killing of RAJI but not of K562 target cells. Further analysis showed that K562 and RAJI cells enhance the binding of guanosine 5'-O-(thiotriphosphate) to IANK cell membranes, and increase the hydrolysis of [32P]GTP in these membranes. Immunoblot analysis showed that K562 and RAJI cells induce the release of alpha o, but not alpha i, alpha s, or alpha q.11 from IANK cell membranes. Cumulatively, these data indicate that putative receptors recognizing K562 or RAJI target cells are coupled to Go in IANK cells, however, only Gs seems to be coupled to receptors recognizing RAJI target cells.

These beta 2m-free class I heavy chains originate from surface beta 2m-associated MHC class I molecules and are expressed as integral membrane glycoproteins on activated, but not resting, cells. We found that the levels of beta 2m-free class I heavy chains can be regulated by proteolytic cleavage and release into the medium of soluble molecules containing the extracellular domains. The release is mediated by a Zn(2+)-dependent, membrane-bound metalloprotease that does not cleave HLA-DR, CD4, and CD71 surface receptors and can be activated by phorbol myristate acetate. Specific cleavage by the metalloprotease occurs at a site close to the papain cleavage site in the alpha 3 domain of class I heavy chains. This site is not accessible to the metalloprotease in beta 2m-associated MHC class I molecules. The dissociation of beta 2m-associated MHC class I molecules and subsequent cleavage of beta 2m-free class I heavy chains may be partially responsible for controlling the levels of MHC class I molecules on the surface of activated cells.","['Demaria, S', 'Schwab, R', 'Gottesman, S R', 'Bushkin, Y']","['Demaria S', 'Schwab R', 'Gottesman SR', 'Bushkin Y']","['Laboratory of Molecular Immunology, Public Health Research Institute, New York, New York 10016.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/metabolism', 'CD4 Antigens/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HLA-DR Antigens/metabolism', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/biosynthesis/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/enzymology/*immunology', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*immunology', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Metalloendopeptidases/*metabolism', 'Phenanthrolines/pharmacology', 'Receptors, Transferrin', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Zinc/pharmacology', 'beta 2-Microglobulin/*isolation & purification']",1994/03/04 00:00,1994/03/04 00:01,['1994/03/04 00:00'],"['1994/03/04 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/03/04 00:01 [medline]', '1994/03/04 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(17)37430-6 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1994 Mar 4;269(9):6689-94.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (CD71 antigen)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Phenanthrolines)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', '0 (beta 2-Microglobulin)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (Metalloendopeptidases)', 'J41CSQ7QDS (Zinc)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,,"['AG 08092/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 AI 07382/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Analysis of an early signal pathway metabolite, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, following bombesin and PDGF treatment to quiscent cells, revealed that both control and nef-transformed cells displayed similar kinetics of signal formation. Normally, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate mediates increase in the cytosolic free Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i). Upon stimulation with bombesin or PDGF, control cells displayed a 2-4-fold increase of [Ca2+]i over the basal level, while the [Ca2+]i response in nef-expressing NIH-3T3 cells was lacking or highly diminished. However, the release of [Ca2+]i from the intracellular store of the nef-expressing cells by an endomembrane Ca2+ ATPase inhibitor, thapsigargin, revealed that these cells contained normal Ca2+ stores. These results suggest a specific, definable biochemical activity for the HIV-1 Nef protein in the context of a well characterized cellular activation pathway. Our results thus define, for the first time, a unique function of Nef that is not limited to an alteration of T cell function or of expression of a T cell surface antigen.","['De, S K', 'Marsh, J W']","['De SK', 'Marsh JW']","['Laboratory of Molecular Biology, National Institute of Mental Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Bombesin/pharmacology', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Cytosol/metabolism', 'DNA Replication/drug effects', 'Gene Products, nef/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Genes, nef', 'Genetic Vectors', 'HIV-1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate/*metabolism', 'Kanamycin Kinase', 'Kinetics', 'Methionine/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus', 'Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor)/biosynthesis', 'Platelet-Derived Growth Factor/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Transfection', 'nef Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus']",1994/03/04 00:00,1994/03/04 00:01,['1994/03/04 00:00'],"['1994/03/04 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/03/04 00:01 [medline]', '1994/03/04 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(17)37424-0 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1994 Mar 4;269(9):6656-60.,"['0 (Gene Products, nef)', '0 (Platelet-Derived Growth Factor)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (nef Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus)', '85166-31-0 (Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate)', 'AE28F7PNPL (Methionine)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor))', 'EC 2.7.1.95 (Kanamycin Kinase)', 'PX9AZU7QPK (Bombesin)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,,,,"['nef', 'neo']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, we found that OSM is a much more potent inducer of both mitogen-activated protein kinase activity and biological response, both of which correlate with the expression of a second OSM receptor that does not bind LIF. In addition, different patterns of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were stimulated by OSM and LIF. We therefore suggest that the two receptors for OSM can be coupled to different signal transduction events.","['Thoma, B', 'Bird, T A', 'Friend, D J', 'Gearing, D P', 'Dower, S K']","['Thoma B', 'Bird TA', 'Friend DJ', 'Gearing DP', 'Dower SK']","['Department of Biochemistry, Immunex Corporation, Seattle, Washington 98101.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Growth Inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Humans', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit', 'Lymphokines/*metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oncostatin M', 'Peptides/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', 'Receptors, Cytokine/*metabolism', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF', 'Receptors, Oncostatin M', '*Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tyrosine/metabolism']",1994/02/25 00:00,1994/02/25 00:01,['1994/02/25 00:00'],"['1994/02/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/02/25 00:01 [medline]', '1994/02/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(17)37590-7 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1994 Feb 25;269(8):6215-22.,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (LIFR protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (OSM protein, human)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', '0 (Receptors, Oncostatin M)', '106956-32-5 (Oncostatin M)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Increased phosphorylation of p93c-Fes was detected in p210Bcr/Abl(+) human leukemic cell lines, in primary leukemic cells from patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia, and in myeloid cell lines expressing p210Bcr/Abl after transfection.

(1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 19076-19080). Activation of the cycle by tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) occurs rapidly, with peak levels of approximately 30% SM hydrolysis observed within 45-60 min. The mechanisms by which TNF alpha induces this SM turnover remain largely unexplored. In this study, arachidonic acid (AA) was investigated as a potential mediator of TNF alpha effects on SM turnover. In HL-60 cells, 30 nM TNF alpha stimulated the release of AA within 5-10 min. In turn, AA stimulated SM hydrolysis and concomitant ceramide generation within 20 min of addition to cells. Other fatty acids, notably oleate, mimicked the effects of AA on SM hydrolysis, but the methyl ester and alcohol analogs of fatty acids were inactive. Diacylglycerol, a candidate mediator of TNF alpha responses, AA activated a cytosolic sphingomyelinase dose dependently, with 10-100 microM AA including 3-4-fold activation, thus suggesting a direct effect of AA on sphingomyelinase. Melittin, a potent phospholipase A2 activator, induced SM hydrolysis at concentrations as low as 35 nM. However, unlike AA, melittin was unable to stimulate sphingomyelinase activation in an in vitro assay system. Finally, exogenous addition of AA also produced antiproliferative effects reminiscent of ceramide effects. Thus, a role for the phospholipase A2/AA pathway in mediating TNF alpha induction of the SM cycle is supported by multiple lines of evidence. These studies begin to elucidate a mechanism of TNF alpha signaling and identify a close relationship between glycerophospholipid and sphingolipid signaling. AA, therefore, may be pivotal to understanding the sphingomyelin-signaling cascade.","['Jayadev, S', 'Linardic, C M', 'Hannun, Y A']","['Jayadev S', 'Linardic CM', 'Hannun YA']","['Department of Medicine and Cell Biology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina 27710.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Arachidonic Acid/*metabolism', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Division/physiology', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Humans', 'Hydrolysis', 'Sphingomyelin Phosphodiesterase/metabolism', 'Sphingomyelins/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*metabolism']",1994/02/25 00:00,1994/02/25 00:01,['1994/02/25 00:00'],"['1994/02/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/02/25 00:01 [medline]', '1994/02/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(17)37526-9 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1994 Feb 25;269(8):5757-63.,"['0 (Sphingomyelins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '27YG812J1I (Arachidonic Acid)', 'EC 3.1.4.12 (Sphingomyelin Phosphodiesterase)']",,,,['GM43825/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We transfected the plasmid into human leukemia THP-1 cells and isolated transformants. Metal-inducible reduction in poly(ADP-ribose) synthetase activity was observed in two pAS-5'-transfected clones out of 72 neo-resistant clones examined, and metal-independent reduction in the activity was exhibited in pAS-FL-transfected clones. The antisense RNA was induced in a metal-dependent manner in the clones transfected with pAS-5', as judged by hybridizing with a sense riboprobe of the synthetase gene. The mRNA of the synthetase decreased 1 day after an addition of metal ions, and the synthetase activity of the transformants decreased by more than 90% 3 days after an addition of metal ions. Thus, we incubated the transformant clones in the presence of metal ions for 3 days and then treated them with IFN-gamma. The IFN-gamma-inducible expression of MHC class II molecules was amplified in the transformant clones, as judged by RNA blot analysis and flow cytometry. These results indicate that the decrease in poly(ADP-ribose) synthetase makes THP-1 cells favorable to induce MHC class II molecules by IFN-gamma.","['Qu, Z', 'Fujimoto, S', 'Taniguchi, T']","['Qu Z', 'Fujimoto S', 'Taniguchi T']","['Medical Research Laboratory, Kochi Medical School, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Gene Expression/*drug effects', 'Genes, MHC Class II/*genetics', 'HLA-DR Antigens/genetics', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/*pharmacology', 'Metals', 'Plasmids', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/*genetics', 'RNA, Antisense/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/02/25 00:00,1994/02/25 00:01,['1994/02/25 00:00'],"['1994/02/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/02/25 00:01 [medline]', '1994/02/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(17)37495-1 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1994 Feb 25;269(8):5543-7.,"['0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (Metals)', '0 (RNA, Antisense)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The 2 cell lines showed a reaction pattern with 5 distinct anti-CEA and anti-NCA monoclonal antibodies, similar to that of CHO transfectants expressing recombinant NCA-50/90. Immunoprecipitation and SDS-PAGE analyses identified glycoproteins of about 95 and 55 kDa in U-937 and THP-1 cells, respectively.

Upon Northern-blot analysis, only one band of approximately 2.5 kb was detected in both cell lines with a cDNA probe for NCA-50/90, which has a broad specificity to the CEA gene family members. cDNA cloning demonstrated that the 2.5-kb clones encode the peptide of NCA-50/90.

Murine ascites developed from the anti-mycobacterial hsp65 hybridoma ML30 have been shown to contain an antibody that binds to the surface of a range of stimulated myelomonocytic cell lines; however, as the purified ML30 monoclonal antibody produced in vitro did not bind to these cell lines, the results were not considered conclusive evidence of cell-surface expression of the hsp60 homologue of the mycobacterial hsp 65 on human cells. In an effort to clarify this situation, we have confirmed that the ascites derived from the ML30 hybridoma bound to the surface of human myeloid leukemia cell lines and myeloid blast cells purified from freshly diagnosed leukemic patients, but that the in vitro-derived ML30 antibody did not. In addition, we have isolated Fab fragments from the ascites derived from the ML30 hybridoma and demonstrated that these fragments bound to the surface of human myeloid leukemia cells after their treatment with the glutamine analog 6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine (DON) for various times up to four days. Evidence has been presented in the literature that the ML30 monoclonal antibody recognizes a molecule corresponding to the human hsp60 homologue of the mycobacterial hsp65; therefore our results from the binding of Fab fragment preparations from ascites imply that when human myeloid leukemic cells are treated with DON, they express a human hsp60 homologue on their surface.","['Fitzgerald, M', 'Keast, D']","['Fitzgerald M', 'Keast D']","['University Department of Microbiology, Queen Elizabeth II Medical Centre, Nedlands, Australia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,FASEB J,FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology,8804484,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology', 'Bacterial Proteins/*analysis/immunology', 'Diazooxonorleucine/pharmacology', 'Heat-Shock Proteins/*analysis/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Fab Fragments/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mycobacterium/*chemistry', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/02/01 00:00,1994/02/01 00:01,['1994/02/01 00:00'],"['1994/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1096/fasebj.8.2.8119496 [doi]'],ppublish,FASEB J. 1994 Feb;8(2):259-61. doi: 10.1096/fasebj.8.2.8119496.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Bacterial Proteins)', '0 (Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Fab Fragments)', '03J0H273KZ (Diazooxonorleucine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A cell's selection of terminal osteoclast phenotype is controlled by many different factors, which are not well understood and which may also control the expression of CA-II. We studied the control of CA-II expression in the human HL-60 cell to better understand the signal transduction systems involved in progression to the osteoclast phenotype. Both 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25-(OH)2D3; 10 nM] and phorbol myristate acetate (10 ng/ml), doses that cause monocytic differentiation of the HL-60 cell, induced small increases in CA-II mRNA and CA-II protein, as measured by Northern analysis and Western immunoblotting, respectively. The maximal response was seen at 3 days. Treatment of HL-60 cells with both agents resulted in synergistic increases in CA-II mRNA (80-fold) and protein. The large increase in CA-II mRNA allowed assessment of the dose dependence of both agents, with ED50 values of 1 nM for 1,25-(OH)2D3 and 1 ng/ml for phorbol myristate acetate. In addition, we have shown that this synergistic response was completely inhibited by a potent inhibitor of protein kinase-C activity, staurosporine (0.1 microM), which has not previously been demonstrated in other cell systems. Staurosporine did not inhibit 1,25-(OH)2D3 induction of nonspecific esterase. Thus, 1,25-(OH)2D3 synergistically interacts with protein kinase-C-activated systems to cause a myelomonocytic precursor to express CA-II a marker of the osteoclast phenotype.","['Biskobing, D M', 'Nanes, M S', 'Rubin, J']","['Biskobing DM', 'Nanes MS', 'Rubin J']","['Department of Medicine, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Endocrinology,Endocrinology,0375040,IM,"['Alkaloids/pharmacology', 'Calcitriol/*pharmacology', 'Carbonic Anhydrases/*genetics', 'Drug Synergism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*enzymology', 'Protein Kinase C/physiology', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Staurosporine', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/03/01 00:00,1994/03/01 00:01,['1994/03/01 00:00'],"['1994/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1210/endo.134.3.8119191 [doi]'],ppublish,Endocrinology. 1994 Mar;134(3):1493-8. doi: 10.1210/endo.134.3.8119191.,"['0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 4.2.1.1 (Carbonic Anhydrases)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,,['2732-DK-0798-11/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, 6 compounds induced the appearance of a 200-base pair nucleosomal DNA ladder characteristic of apoptosis at 24 h in parental 32D cl3(G) cells + IL-3, which mimicked the effects of IL-3 withdrawal alone, but not in similarly growth arrested LG7 cells that eventually developed a necrotic pattern of DNA fragmentation. These studies suggest that the expression of p210bcr/abl can suppress apoptotic signal transduction and that this may contribute to the development of the myeloid hyperplasia that occurs in chronic phase chronic myelogenous leukemia.","['Laneuville, P', 'Timm, M', 'Hudson, A T']","['Laneuville P', 'Timm M', 'Hudson AT']","['Department of Medicine, McGill University, Royal Victoria Hospital, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/*physiology', 'Cell Death/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*physiology', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Hematopoietic System/cytology/enzymology/physiology', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Signal Transduction/physiology']",1994/03/01 00:00,1994/03/01 00:01,['1994/03/01 00:00'],"['1994/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1994 Mar 1;54(5):1360-6.,"['0 (Interleukin-3)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,,,,"['bcr-abl', 'neo']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mutations were detected in seven families. Six were point mutations with one each affecting codons 175, 180, and 220 and three affecting codon 248. The seventh was a deletion/insertion mutation in exon 4. Germline mutations in p53 were a feature of families which included children with rhabdomyosarcoma and/or adrenal cortical carcinoma. Germline p53 mutations were detected in six of the nine families with such tumors. An analysis of these 7 mutations, together with 34 published examples, showed that more than one-half were transitions at CpG dinucleotides, suggesting that the majority of germline p53 mutations may arise as a result of spontaneous events. The most common cancers occurring in the 41 families with germline p53 mutations, in common with classic LFS, were bone and soft tissue sarcoma, breast cancer, brain tumors, leukemia, and adrenocortical carcinoma, although less than one-half of the probands with germline p53 mutations came from classic LFS families. More than one-half of the cancers overall and nearly one-third of the breast cancers were diagnosed before 30 years of age. These observations have important implications for asymptomatic carriers of germline p53 mutations, and there is a need for international collaboration in the development of protocols for the management of such families.","['Birch, J M', 'Hartley, A L', 'Tricker, K J', 'Prosser, J', 'Condie, A', 'Kelsey, A M', 'Harris, M', 'Jones, P H', 'Binchy, A', 'Crowther, D']","['Birch JM', 'Hartley AL', 'Tricker KJ', 'Prosser J', 'Condie A', 'Kelsey AM', 'Harris M', 'Jones PH', 'Binchy A', 'Crowther D', 'et al.']","['CRC Paediatric & Familial Cancer Research Group, Christie Hospital NHS Trust, Manchester, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Child', 'Codon/genetics', 'Exons/genetics', 'Family Health', 'Female', 'Genes, p53/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Li-Fraumeni Syndrome/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Pedigree', 'Prevalence']",1994/03/01 00:00,1994/03/01 00:01,['1994/03/01 00:00'],"['1994/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1994 Mar 1;54(5):1298-304.,['0 (Codon)'],,,,,['p53'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

The ribozymes were directly synthesized using a set of primers, one containing a bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase promoter. A target MDR1 RNA was created by a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction using a MOLT-3 human acute leukemia cell line resistant to trimetrexate (TMQ) (MOLT-3/TMQ800), which displayed MDR1 overexpression. In a cell-free system, both ribozymes cleaved a target piece of MDR1 RNA into 2 fragments at the specific sites at a physiological pH and temperature. The cleavage reaction was dependent on time, ribozyme:substrate ratio, and magnesium concentration. The 196 MDR1 ribozyme was more active than the 179 MDR1 ribozyme. The 196 MDR1 ribozyme was then cloned into a human expression vector, and MOLT-3/TMQ800 cells were transfected. The original MOLT-3/TMQ800 cells were nearly 700-fold resistant to vincristine, whereas the transfectant cells selected in G418 became only 20- to 30-fold resistant. The level of resistance and the amount of MDR1 RNA expressed appeared to correlate inversely with the amount of ribozyme expression. A disabled 196 MDR1 ribozyme was capable of neither specific cleavage in vitro nor decreasing MDR1 expression in transfectant cells. These results indicate that it was the ribozyme activity and not antisense activity which was responsible for decreased MDR1 RNA. This approach may be applicable to cancer patients as a specific means to reverse tumors with P-glycoprotein-mediated MDR phenotype back to a drug-sensitive one.","['Kobayashi, H', 'Dorai, T', 'Holland, J F', 'Ohnuma, T']","['Kobayashi H', 'Dorai T', 'Holland JF', 'Ohnuma T']","['Department of Medicine, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, New York 10029.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Codon/genetics', 'Drug Resistance/*genetics/physiology', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/physiopathology', 'RNA, Catalytic/chemical synthesis/*pharmacology/physiology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vincristine/pharmacology']",1994/03/01 00:00,1994/03/01 00:01,['1994/03/01 00:00'],"['1994/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1994 Mar 1;54(5):1271-5.,"['0 (Codon)', '0 (RNA, Catalytic)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)']",,,,,"['MDR (PGY)', 'MDR1']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The protein products of this family are highly homologous and include CEA, biliary glycoprotein, nonspecific cross-reacting antigen 50/90 (NCA 50/90), NCA 95, and pregnancy-specific beta-glycoprotein. We used a monoclonal antibody with high affinity to develop a specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method for NCA 50/90 in serum and plasma. Our calibrators were based on affinity-purified recombinant protein from a baculovirus expression system. No significant reactivity with purified CEA, recombinant NCA 95, or recombinant biliary glycoprotein was found by Western blot analysis or in the ELISA method. Only 1 of 15 sera from pregnant women (chorionic gonadotropin > 1000 ng/ml) was positive in the NCA 50/90 ELISA, suggesting that this method does not detect pregnancy-specific glycoprotein.

Only 3 of 31 serum and plasma samples from patients with clinically inactive breast cancer were elevated above the cutoff value, but 44% of 136 samples from patients with clinically active breast cancer were positive. NCA 50/90 measurements were elevated in 7 of 25 patients with active breast cancer whose CEA and CA 15-3 values were below cutoff, and NCA 50/90 values do not correlate with CEA in breast cancer. In addition, we found sensitivities of 70, 39, and 42% for lung cancer, colon cancer, and leukemia, respectively. The sensitivity for non-small cell lung cancer was 85%, however, compared to 50% for small cell lung cancer. Serum from leukemia patients showed an overall sensitivity of 43%, but 71% (10 of 14) sera from patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia were positive compared to, for example, chronic lymphocytic leukemia where 0 of 7 sera had NCA 50/90 values above the cutoff.

Ten patients with leukemia and secondary PAP are described. Three patients had received bone marrow transplants. Data obtained from sequential BAL have shown that at least four of them--all of them achieving complete remission or recovery from neutropenia after bone marrow transplantation--had reversible PAP, and we emphasize this potential reversibility. Furthermore, in order to estimate the frequency of PAP in hematologic patients, we retrospectively studied 113 episodes of pneumonia occurring in our department over a 2-yr period. The incidence of secondary PAP in patients with pulmonary symptoms was so estimated at 5.3% among all the hematologic population, and to 10% in patients with myeloid disorders. This report (1) confirms that BAL is an accurate way to diagnose PAP in immunocompromised hosts, (2) emphasizes that PAP is not an unusual cause of respiratory failure in this population and that it is strongly associated with myeloid disorders, and (3) shows that secondary PAP is potentially reversible, especially if complete remission of the underlying disease is achieved.","['Cordonnier, C', 'Fleury-Feith, J', 'Escudier, E', 'Atassi, K', 'Bernaudin, J F']","['Cordonnier C', 'Fleury-Feith J', 'Escudier E', 'Atassi K', 'Bernaudin JF']","['Department of Clinical Hematology, Hopital Henri Mondor, Creteil, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Respir Crit Care Med,American journal of respiratory and critical care medicine,9421642,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid/cytology/microbiology', 'Causality', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Immunocompromised Host', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia/*complications/immunology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutropenia/etiology', 'Periodic Acid-Schiff Reaction', 'Prognosis', 'Pulmonary Alveolar Proteinosis/epidemiology/*etiology/pathology', 'Remission, Spontaneous', 'Respiratory Insufficiency/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Retrospective Studies']",1994/03/01 00:00,1994/03/01 00:01,['1994/03/01 00:00'],"['1994/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1164/ajrccm.149.3.8118651 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Respir Crit Care Med. 1994 Mar;149(3 Pt 1):788-94. doi: 10.1164/ajrccm.149.3.8118651.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This preleukemic state has called the attention of several investigators around the world, since it represents a way to study the origin and progression of leukemia in man. During the past 5 years, major advances in the molecular and cellular biology of this disease have been achieved. It is now known that preleukemia is a clonal disorder that arises from a malignant transformation at the level of primitive pluripotent hemopoietic stem cells. The hemopoietic progenitors in preleukemic patients have abnormal responses to hemopoietic regulators, thus, they do not seem to follow the controlled proliferation observed in the hemopoietic system under normal conditions. The mechanisms of cell differentiation and maturation are also altered, leading to the production of immature (blast) cells, instead of the development of fully mature erythrocytes, granulocytes, platelets and lymphocytes. Several oncogenes, such as C-FMS and RAS, have been found to be structurally altered in a significant proportion of preleukemic patients, suggesting that they may be involved in the pathogenesis of the disease.

To account for the elevated levels of EpoR mRNA, the activity of the promoter and expression of DNase I hypersensitive sites were assessed as markers of transcriptional activity in various cell lines. Among a series of 5' flanking restriction fragments linked to a reporter gene, a 83-bp fragment that includes binding sites for the transcription factors GATA-1 and Sp-1 gave low levels of erythroid-specific activity, and a 256-bp fragment that includes, in addition, two sites for the putative CACCC-binding protein gave the highest level of erythroid-specific transcription. DNase I footprinting showed binding of a constitutive factor to the proximal CACCC-binding site, and deletion or mutation of this site significantly reduced the overall expression while maintaining tissue-specificity. Three DNase I hypersensitive sites were detected in the 5' flanking region of the EpoR gene, two of which were unique to MEL cells. These sites were situated over the promoter region and approximately 0.5 kb and 2.4 kb upstream of the transcriptional initiation sites. A 0.8-kb restriction fragment spanning the distal site caused approximately a four-fold rise in transcription from the endogenous or a heterologous promoter in MEL cells independent of its orientation and up to 1.5-fold rise in CB-5 cells, but it was inactive in COS-1 cells that were cotransfected with an expression plasmid encoding GATA-1. These results show that (1) basal activity as well as tissue specificity of the EpoR promoter can be accounted for by its interaction with GATA-1, and (2) upstream sites regulate the strength of the promoter. Expression of the distal DNase I hypersensitive site and the corresponding enhancer activity in MEL cells suggests a role for this element in stage-specific transcriptional control.","['Youssoufian, H']",['Youssoufian H'],"[""Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA 02115.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Deoxyribonuclease I/pharmacology', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors', '*Erythropoiesis', 'Erythropoietin/*genetics', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nucleosomes/ultrastructure', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Transcription Factors/genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/03/01 00:00,1994/03/01 00:01,['1994/03/01 00:00'],"['1994/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)74973-6 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1994 Mar 1;83(5):1428-35.,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors)', '0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Gata1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Nucleosomes)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', 'EC 3.1.21.1 (Deoxyribonuclease I)']",,,,['HL02277/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],['EpoR'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Southern blot hybridization analysis showed identical clonal immunoglobulin (Ig) gene-rearrangement patterns in the CLL/SLL and DLL components in four cases and different Ig gene-rearrangement patterns in two cases. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification, cloning, and DNA sequencing of complementary determinant region 3 (CDR3) of the Ig-heavy chain gene of one of the two cases in which the Ig gene-rearrangement patterns were different showed nonidentical sequences in the CLL/SLL and DLL components. In the other case, monomorphic Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) genome integration was detected in the DLL but not in the CLL, suggesting that the CLL and DLL components in this case of Richter's syndrome also represent unrelated clones. Single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis and sequencing of exons 5 through 9 of the p53 tumor-suppressor gene showed a mutation in codon 176 of the DLL but not in the CLL/SLL component in one case where the CLL/SLL and DLL represented different clones. The p53 mutation probably played a role in the development of the lymphoma rather than morphologic transformation of the CLL/SLL in this case. SSCP analysis and sequencing also showed identical mutations in codon 282 in both the CLL/SLL and DLL components in a case where the CLL and DLL represented identical clones. Thus, this p53 gene mutation was present both before and after morphologic transformation, and therefore, probably did not play a primary role in this process. Southern blot hybridization analysis failed to show evidence of bcl-1, bcl-2, c-myc proto-oncogene or retinoblastoma (Rb) tumor-suppressor gene rearrangements in these six cases of Richter's syndrome. In conclusion, the original CLL/SLL and the subsequent DLL in Richter's syndrome may or may not be derived from identical clones, and the well-known proto-oncogenes and tumor-suppressor genes do not appear to play an obvious and consistent role in the morphologic transformation of CLL/SLL to DLL.","['Matolcsy, A', 'Inghirami, G', 'Knowles, D M']","['Matolcsy A', 'Inghirami G', 'Knowles DM']","['Division of Surgical Pathology, Columbia University, College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY 10032.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Base Sequence', 'Clone Cells', 'DNA Primers/chemistry', 'DNA, Viral/analysis', 'Female', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Light Chains/genetics', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oncogenes', 'Point Mutation', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogenes', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Syndrome']",1994/03/01 00:00,1994/03/01 00:01,['1994/03/01 00:00'],"['1994/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)74965-7 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1994 Mar 1;83(5):1363-72.,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Light Chains)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)']",,,,"['CA 42836/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'EY 06337/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States']","['Rb', 'bcl-1', 'bcl-2', 'c-myc', 'p53']",,"['GENBANK/S69756', 'GENBANK/S69758', 'GENBANK/S69759', 'GENBANK/S69760', 'GENBANK/S69761', 'GENBANK/S69764']",,,,,,,,,,,

In combination, these techniques amplified one or more clonal markers at presentation in 90% of patients (IgH-PCR, 75%; V delta 2-D delta 3-PCR, 46%; both, 33%). Changes in the pattern of amplification between presentation and first relapse were seen in 31% of patients positive by IgH-PCR at presentation and in 25% of those positive by TCR delta-PCR. Only 3 patients showed complete change in their rearrangements, which is suggestive of relapse with a new clone. Furthermore, despite the high reported rates of oligoclonality and clonal evolution at the IgH locus, the results presented show that false-negative minimal residual disease (MRD) detection can be avoided by designing D-N-J probes to all presentation rearrangements. Using a PCR approach for both gene markers, false-negative testing because of clonal evolution would have only occurred in 3 (8%) of the IgH-positive patients, in contrast to 5 (21%) of V delta 2-D delta 3-positive patients. Combining these two systems increases the proportion of patients open to study to 90%, allows comparative studies of the sensitive of the two methods, and reduces the rate of false-negative assessment of MRD caused by clonal evolution to less than 10%. We conclude that large prospective PCR studies of MRD detection should examine gene rearrangements at multiple loci to maximize their applicability and to minimize false-negative relapse prediction.","['Steward, C G', 'Goulden, N J', 'Katz, F', 'Baines, D', 'Martin, P G', 'Langlands, K', 'Potter, M N', 'Chessells, J M', 'Oakhill, A']","['Steward CG', 'Goulden NJ', 'Katz F', 'Baines D', 'Martin PG', 'Langlands K', 'Potter MN', 'Chessells JM', 'Oakhill A']","['Department of Pathology, Bristol University Medical School, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Base Sequence', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA Primers/chemistry', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Heavy Chain/*genetics', '*Gene Rearrangement, delta-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor', '*Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Infant', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta/*genetics', 'Recurrence', 'Time Factors']",1994/03/01 00:00,1994/03/01 00:01,['1994/03/01 00:00'],"['1994/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)74964-5 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1994 Mar 1;83(5):1355-62.,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta)']",,,,,,,"['GENBANK/S69749', 'GENBANK/S69750', 'GENBANK/S69797']",,,,,,,,,,,

Because of this, we sought to determine whether Crem functions independently as a modulator of MDR in blast cells obtained from acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) patients, and the nature of its interaction in combination with CsA in reversing an MDR phenotype. In the phenotypically classical MDR AML cell lines HL-60/Vinc (overexpresses Pgp) or HL-60/AR (does not overexpress Pgp), the dose causing half-maximum enhancement (D50) of daunorubicin (DNR, 1 micrograms/mL, 3 hours) accumulation was achieved by the combination of CsA and Crem (CsA/Crem) at 1.2 mumol/L CsA. In contrast, the D50 for Crem alone was approached at an amount that would be needed to suspend 6.2 mumol/L CsA for HL-60/Vinc, and 81 mumol/L CsA for HL-60/AR. The D50 concentrations for CsA alone (dissolved in ethanol, which does not alter DNR accumulation) were also higher than those for CsA/Crem, being 6.5 mumol/L for HL-60/Vinc, and 3.1 mumol/L for HL-60/AR. The maximum absolute level of enhancement of DNR accumulation (Emax) in each cell line was approximately equivalent for CsA/Crem or CsA alone, and was equal to the 3 hr intracellular DNR accumulation observed in parental, drug sensitive HL-60/W cells. For Crem alone, HL-60/AR and HL-60/Vinc cells showed markedly different responses: HL-60/Vinc cells attained intracellular DNR content comparable to HL-60/W, whereas HL-60/AR cells achieved only approximately 35% of this level. Multiple-drug effects were analyzed by calculation of the Combination Index (Chou and Talalay, Adv Enzyme Regul 22:27, 1984), which indicated that CsA and Crem are synergistic in causing enhancement of DNR accumulation in these MDR HL-60 cell lines. In blasts from AML patients, 5 mumol/L CsA/Crem or an equivalent amount of Crem alone each caused significant (P < .001) enhancement of DNR accumulation (60 AML-patient marrow samples) or DNR retention (51 AML-patient marrows). Similarly, CsA/Crem or Crem alone caused significant (P < .01) enhancement of the cytotoxicity of DNR in 36 AML blast cell specimens. The degree of enhancement of accumulation/retention or cytotoxicity by CsA/Crem was approximately equivalent to that obtained with Crem alone. These studies indicate that Crem can reverse an MDR phenotype in patient AML blast cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Ross, D D', 'Wooten, P J', 'Tong, Y', 'Cornblatt, B', 'Levy, C', 'Sridhara, R', 'Lee, E J', 'Schiffer, C A']","['Ross DD', 'Wooten PJ', 'Tong Y', 'Cornblatt B', 'Levy C', 'Sridhara R', 'Lee EJ', 'Schiffer CA']","['University of Maryland Cancer Center, Baltimore 21201.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cyclosporine/*administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/toxicity', '*Drug Resistance', 'Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'Glycerol/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/03/01 00:00,1994/03/01 00:01,['1994/03/01 00:00'],"['1994/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)74962-1 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1994 Mar 1;83(5):1337-47.,"['6D4M1DAL6O (cremophor EL)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', 'PDC6A3C0OX (Glycerol)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",,,,"['R0-1-CA40188/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R0-1-CA52178/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because these results suggested that the P2T receptor may be an early marker for megakaryocytic differentiation, we studied whether this calcium-signaling receptor is also expressed in Dami cells, a human megakaryocytic leukemia cell line. Here we report evidence that Dami cells express a P2T receptor for ADP. The calcium response EC50 values for ADP, 2-methylthioadenosine diphosphate (2-MeS-ADP), and adenosine 5'-O-(2-thiodiphosphate) (ADP beta S) in Dami cells are 0.4 mumol/L, 0.04 mumol/L, and 2 mumol/L, respectively, which approximate the potencies of these agonists in K562 cells and in platelets. The platelet P2T receptor antagonists 2-methylthioadenosine triphosphate (2-MeS-ATP), and 2-chloroadenosine triphosphate (2-Cl-ATP) were surprisingly potent agonists at the P2T receptor in both Dami and K562 cells. Dami cells, unlike K562 cells and platelets, also respond to adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and uridine triphosphate (UTP) with an increase in intracellular calcium. Adenosine monophosphate (AMP) is an effective antagonist of the response to ADP, 2-MeS-ADP, ADP beta S, 2-MeS-ATP, and 2-Cl-ATP, but not to ATP and UTP. The responses to maximal concentrations of UTP in combination with either ADP, 2-MeS-ADP, ADP beta S, or 2-MeS-ATP are additive. In contrast, ADP in combination with either 2-MeS-ADP, ADP beta S, 2-MeS-ATP, or 2-Cl-ATP are not additive. UTP desensitized Dami cells to ATP but not to ADP, 2-MeS-ADP, ADP beta S, or 2-MeS-ATP. Addition of ATP after UTP desensitization antagonized subsequent responsiveness to ADP. The data suggest that the receptor for ADP may be a unique P2T subtype, and the receptor for ATP and UTP is distinct from that of ADP and is most characteristic of the P2U (nucleotide) receptor subtype. Activation of either the P2T or P2U receptor causes a rapid generation of inositol trisphosphate in Dami cells.","['Murgo, A J', 'Contrera, J G', 'Sistare, F D']","['Murgo AJ', 'Contrera JG', 'Sistare FD']","['Division of Research and Testing, Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, Food and Drug Administration, Laurel, MD 20708.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adenine Nucleotides/pharmacology', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Calcium/*physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate/metabolism', 'Ligands', 'Megakaryocytes/*physiology', 'Receptors, Purinergic/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Uridine Triphosphate/pharmacology']",1994/03/01 00:00,1994/03/01 00:01,['1994/03/01 00:00'],"['1994/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)74954-2 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1994 Mar 1;83(5):1258-67.,"['0 (Adenine Nucleotides)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Receptors, Purinergic)', '85166-31-0 (Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)', 'UT0S826Z60 (Uridine Triphosphate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By virtue of its membership in the basic helix-loop-helix family of transcription factors, the SCL gene is a candidate to regulate events in hematopoietic differentiation. We have used polyclonal antibody raised against a bacterial expressed malE-SCL fusion protein to characterize SCL protein expression in postimplantation embryos and in neonatal and adult mice. SCL protein was detected at day 7.5 post coitum at both embryonic and extraembryonic sites, approximately 24 hours before the formation of recognizable hematopoietic elements. Expression then localized to blood islands of the yolk sac followed by localization to fetal liver and spleen, paralleling the hematopoietic activity of these tissues during development. SCL protein was detected in erythroblasts in fetal and adult spleen, myeloid cells and megakaryocytes in spleen and bone marrow, mast cells in skin, and in rare cells in fetal and adult thymus. In addition, SCL protein was noted in endothelial progenitors in blood islands and in endothelial cells and angioblasts in a number of organs at times coincident with their vascularization. SCL expression was also observed in other nonhematopoietic cell types in the developing skeletal and nervous systems. These results show that SCL expression is one of the earliest markers of mammalian hematopoietic development and are compatible with a role for this transcription factor in terminal differentiation of the erythroid and megakaryocytic lineages. SCL expression by cells in the thymus suggests that the gene may be active at some stage of T-cell differentiation and may be relevant to its involvement by chromosomal rearrangements in T-lymphoid leukemias. Finally, expression of the gene in developing brain, cartilage, and vascular endothelium indicates SCL may have actions in neural development, osteogenesis, and vasculogenesis, as well as in hematopoietic differentiation.","['Kallianpur, A R', 'Jordan, J E', 'Brandt, S J']","['Kallianpur AR', 'Jordan JE', 'Brandt SJ']","['Department of Medicine (Hematology), Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors', 'DNA Primers/chemistry', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Endothelium, Vascular/metabolism', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Gestational Age', 'Helix-Loop-Helix Motifs', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred ICR/embryology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism']",1994/03/01 00:00,1994/03/01 00:01,['1994/03/01 00:00'],"['1994/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)74947-5 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1994 Mar 1;83(5):1200-8.,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Tal1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",,,,"['R29 HL49118/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 DK07186/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']","['SCL', 'TAL-1']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

In 1985, we initiated a program in which this modality was used as the initial salvage therapy in patients relapsing after combination chemotherapy. Fifty-eight patients with HD in first relapse after primary chemotherapy received conditioning with high-dose cyclophosphamide, carmustine, etoposide (VP16-213) +/- cisplatin (CBV +/- P) followed by autologous BMT. All but six of these patients were given a median of two cycles of conventional chemotherapy +/- involved field radiation therapy before CBV +/- P and autologous BMT. These measures were not used as a means for patients selection; all patients receiving such therapy ultimately were transplanted. The probability of nonrelapse mortality, progression of HD, and progression-free survival post-BMT were calculated, and prognostic factors for progression-free survival were evaluated using the Cox proportional hazards method. Treatment-related deaths occurred in only three patients. Thirteen patients have relapsed at a median 0.7 years (range 0.1 to 3.5) post-BMT. At a median follow-up of 2.3 years (range 0.4 to 7.2), the actuarial progression-free survival is 64% (95% confidence interval, 46% to 78%). In the statistical analysis, three similarly weighted but independent prognostic factors were identified: ""B"" symptoms at relapse, extranodal disease at relapse, and initial remission duration of less than 1 year. Patients with no risk factors had a 3-year progression-free survival of 100%, compared with 81% in patients with one factor, 40% in those with two factors, and 0% in patients with all three factors. CBV +/- P and autologous BMT is highly effective salvage therapy for HD patients in a first relapse, particularly in the subset of patients with less than two adverse factors.

Here we show that K562, a chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) cell line expressing the BCR-ABL fusion protein, are resistant to the induction of apoptosis by a number of agents and conditions. Antisense oligodeoxynucleotides corresponding to the translation start of bcr downregulate bcr-abl protein in these cells and render them susceptible to induction of apoptosis by chemotherapeutic agents or serum deprivation. Expression of a temperature sensitive v-Abl protein reverses the effects of the antisense oligonucleotides, such that the cells remain resistant to apoptosis at the permissive temperature. These data indicate that bcr-abl acts as an anti-apoptosis gene in CML cells and suggests that the effect is dependent on the abl kinase activity in this chimeric protein. Inhibition of bcr-abl to render CML cells susceptible to apoptosis can be combined with therapeutic drugs and/or treatment capable of inducing apoptosis to provide an effective strategy for elimination of these cells.","['McGahon, A', 'Bissonnette, R', 'Schmitt, M', 'Cotter, K M', 'Green, D R', 'Cotter, T G']","['McGahon A', 'Bissonnette R', 'Schmitt M', 'Cotter KM', 'Green DR', 'Cotter TG']","[""Department of Biology, St Patrick's College, Kildare, Ireland.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA Primers/chemistry', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*physiology', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/*pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/03/01 00:00,1994/03/01 00:01,['1994/03/01 00:00'],"['1994/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)74944-X [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1994 Mar 1;83(5):1179-87.,"['0 (DNA Primers)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl)']",,,,['AI31591/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],"['abl', 'bcr', 'bcr-abl']",,,,['Blood 1994 Jun 15;83(12):3835'],,,,,,,,,

We have cloned 13 PTPase-related gene fragments from the differentiated U937 cells using the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction method. Two of these were found to be genes of novel isozymes, PTP-U1 and PTP-U2. We investigated the changes in expression of each isozyme during the differentiation of the cells and found that nine isozymes (both cytosolic and transmembranous) were expressed more in the differentiated cells than in the undifferentiated cells. Among them, PTP-U1 and PTP-U2 were greatly induced by phorbol ester. Interestingly, there were two cytosolic isozymes that were down-regulated during the course of differentiation.

We report on unusual high incidence of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) observed in Nicaragua in the last three years. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From 1990 to 1992, 17 of 110 children with acute leukemia were diagnosed as having acute non-lymphoblastic leukemia (AnLL). The diagnosis was performed according to the FAB criteria. In two cases DNA was recovered for molecular analysis of the t(15; 17). RESULTS: Ten of 17 cases of AnLL were classified as APL. PML and RAR alpha gene rearrangements were observed in the two cases where molecular analysis was performed. Nine children received chemotherapy; one was treated with all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA), achieving complete remission. Eight children who received chemotherapy died early of hemorrhage and/or sepsis. DISCUSSION: In Nicaragua, APL may be much more common than is generally observed elsewhere. In recent years initial treatment of APL with ATRA has proved to reduce the incidence of early hemorrhagic deaths, and complete remissions can be achieved without marrow aplasia and thus prevent infectious complications. From that perspective APL might become a curable disease, also in developing countries where the treatment of AnLL is not usually affordable.","['Malta Corea, A', 'Pacheco Espinoza, C', 'Cantu Rajnoldi, A', 'Conter, V', 'Lietti, G', 'Masera, G', 'Sessa, C', 'Cavalli, F', 'Biondi, A', 'Rovelli, A']","['Malta Corea A', 'Pacheco Espinoza C', 'Cantu Rajnoldi A', 'Conter V', 'Lietti G', 'Masera G', 'Sessa C', 'Cavalli F', 'Biondi A', 'Rovelli A']","['Hospital Infantil Manuel Jesus Rivera La Mascota, Managua, Nicaragua.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Ann Oncol,Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,9007735,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/diagnosis/drug therapy/*epidemiology/mortality', 'Male', 'Nicaragua/epidemiology', 'Recurrence', 'Survival Rate']",1993/12/01 00:00,1993/12/01 00:01,['1993/12/01 00:00'],"['1993/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1093/oxfordjournals.annonc.a058400 [doi]', 'S0923-7534(19)64994-X [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Oncol. 1993 Dec;4(10):892-4. doi: 10.1093/oxfordjournals.annonc.a058400.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The qualification of this membrane requires that it reproducibly and predictably remove model mammalian viruses. Using the Viresolve/70 membrane, the mammalian viruses polio, Simian virus-40, Sindbis, reovirus type 3 and Rauscher murine leukemia virus are shown to be reproducibly removed via a sieving mechanism. Mammalian virus retention increases constantly with virus diameter independent of virus class or type, increasing from 3.5 logs with polio virus to greater than 6.8 logs with murine leukemia virus. Consistent with a sieving mechanism, mammalian virus retention with the Viresolve/70 membrane is independent of virus concentration. These results are shown both in the presence and absence of protein in solution. The presence of protein in solution is shown to increase the virus retention coefficient of each virus above that measured in phosphate buffered saline. The model virus retention is shown to be well predicted by hard particle retention reported previously for this membrane. In addition, the hard particle retention is shown to predict the worse case performance expected of the membrane in the presence of protein.","['DiLeo, A J', 'Vacante, D A', 'Deane, E F']","['DiLeo AJ', 'Vacante DA', 'Deane EF']","['Millipore Corporation, Bedford, MA 01730.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Biologicals,Biologicals : journal of the International Association of Biological Standardization,9004494,IM,"['Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Filtration/*methods', 'Humans', 'Mammals/microbiology', '*Membranes, Artificial', 'Particle Size', 'Poliovirus/isolation & purification', 'Proteins/isolation & purification', 'Rauscher Virus/isolation & purification', 'Reoviridae/isolation & purification', 'Simian virus 40/isolation & purification', 'Sindbis Virus/isolation & purification', 'Solutions', 'Vero Cells', 'Viruses/*isolation & purification']",1993/09/01 00:00,1993/09/01 00:01,['1993/09/01 00:00'],"['1993/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S1045-1056(83)71085-7 [pii]', '10.1006/biol.1993.1085 [doi]']",ppublish,Biologicals. 1993 Sep;21(3):275-86. doi: 10.1006/biol.1993.1085.,"['0 (Membranes, Artificial)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Solutions)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DEAB administered in doses of 50 and 100 mg/kg increased the blood acetaldehyde concentration and decreased the plasma acetate concentration in mice treated with ethanol. A pharmacokinetic approach demonstrated that DEAB in doses of 50 and 100 mg/kg inhibited the fraction of ethanol converted to acetate by 32.5 and 67.5%, respectively. This inhibition was comparable with that produced by disulfiram. DEAB produced optimal inhibition of ALDH 10-15 min after administration. DEAB did not change the half-life or the total clearance of antipyrine.

Comparison with small noncleaved cell lymphoma involving the bone marrow.,130-9,"The relationship between acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL-L3) and stage IV small noncleaved cell lymphoma with bone marrow involvement (SNCL) was analyzed by retrospective study of 45 patients. Twelve patients with ALL-L3 had tumour restricted to the marrow and blood with no evidence of an extramedullary tumor at their initial presentation. Nineteen patients with stage IV SNCL had evidence of extramedullary disease in addition to marrow and blood involvement. Fourteen patients with marrow and blood involvement by SNCL at the time of a first or second relapse were also studied. The median age of the ALL-L3 patients was 33.5 years, compared with 13 years for the patients with stage IV SNCL and 10.5 years for the marrow relapse patients. All of the ALL-L3 patients wre male; the male:female ratio for the SNCL patients was 17:2; for the relapse group, 9:5. The majority of the ALL-L3 patients had symptoms related to bone marrow failure; the majority of the SNCL patients had symptoms related to a tumor mass. Laboratory values at the time of initial diagnosis were similar for the ALL-L3 and SNCL patients, except that the median platelet count was lower in the ALL-L3 group. Despite extensive marrow involvement by tumor in most patients, frankly leukemic blood pictures were uncommon. Light-chain-restricted surface immunoglobulin on tumor cells was a consistent finding in all cases tested; the findings were similar in the three groups. Cytogenetic data, available for 19 cases, showed no difference between cases with and without extramedullary disease. The median survival was 5.1 months for ALL-L3 patients and 3.2 months for SNCL patients. The median survival from the time of bone marrow relapse was 2.3 months. These observations suggest that ALL-L3 and SNCL represent different manifestations of the same disease process.","['Dayton, V D', 'Arthur, D C', 'Gajl-Peczalska, K J', 'Brunning, R']","['Dayton VD', 'Arthur DC', 'Gajl-Peczalska KJ', 'Brunning R']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, University of Minnesota Health Sciences Center, Minneapolis 55455.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow/chemistry/*pathology', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/epidemiology/immunology/*pathology', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin M/analysis', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Karyotyping', 'L-Lactate Dehydrogenase/blood', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/epidemiology/immunology/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/epidemiology/immunology/*pathology', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/analysis', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Uric Acid/blood']",1994/02/01 00:00,1994/02/01 00:01,['1994/02/01 00:00'],"['1994/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/ajcp/101.2.130 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Clin Pathol. 1994 Feb;101(2):130-9. doi: 10.1093/ajcp/101.2.130.,"['0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '268B43MJ25 (Uric Acid)', 'EC 1.1.1.27 (L-Lactate Dehydrogenase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, a series of RSV-LTR promoter deletion mutants were used to map sites within the LTR important for MDV-mediated transactivation. MDV-responsive elements within RSV-LTR promoters were localized to a 28-bp segment (nucleotides -109 to -137) which contains a GGTGG pentanucleotide repeat element (PRE). Nuclear extract proteins from uninfected cells bound to the RSV PRE in a sequence-specific manner. Extracts from cells infected with MDV produced novel, sequence-specific complexes with RSV PRE probes. Transactivation in other herpesvirus-retrovirus systems has been shown to depend, at least in part, on expression of herpesvirus immediate-early genes. In this report, we demonstrate that MDV ICP4 is capable of transactivating RSV-LTR promoters containing an intact PRE region. Transactivation with an isolated MDV ICP4 gene expressed from its cognate promoter was less efficient than with intact MDV, suggesting that other MDV-encoded factors are likely to play a role in MDV-mediated transactivation of RSV-LTR promoters. RSV-LTR promoters lacking a PRE region were not efficiently transactivated by MDV ICP4. We conclude that MDV ICP4 may be at least partially responsible for transactivation of RSV-LTR promoters and that this transactivation is likely to be dependent upon presence of a PRE region within RSV-LTR promoters.","['Banders, U T', 'Coussens, P M']","['Banders UT', 'Coussens PM']","['Institute of Biomedicine, Latvian University, Riga.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,IM,"['Animals', 'Avian Sarcoma Viruses/*genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Chick Embryo', 'DNA, Viral', 'Herpesvirus 2, Gallid/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/metabolism', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', '*Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Trans-Activators/genetics/metabolism', '*Transcriptional Activation', '*Viral Proteins']",1994/02/15 00:00,1994/02/15 00:01,['1994/02/15 00:00'],"['1994/02/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/02/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/02/15 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0042-6822(84)71092-0 [pii]', '10.1006/viro.1994.1092 [doi]']",ppublish,Virology. 1994 Feb 15;199(1):1-10. doi: 10.1006/viro.1994.1092.,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '147979-89-3 (ICP4 protein, Gallid herpesvirus 2)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Malignant lymphomas of the kidney (chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, n = 2; immunocytoma, n = 4; centroblastic lymphoma, n = 9) and of the testis (immunocytoma, n = 2; centroblastic lymphoma, n = 27; immunoblastic lymphoma of B-cell type, n = 1) revealed no characteristics of MALT type lymphoma, cytologically or with respect to follicular dendritic cells. Classical lymphoepithelial lesions formed by centrocyte-like cells, a hallmark of MALT, occurred exclusively in thyroid lymphomas of MALT type. Although occurrence of classical lymphoepithelial lesions formed by centrocyte-like cells was limited to thyroid lymphomas of MALT type, a growth pattern of lymphoid blasts, with formation of lesions mimicking lymphoepithelial lesions superficially, was found in 6 of 27 testicular centroblastic lymphomas. Follicular dendritic cells in non-Hodgkin's lymphomas of MALT type show distinct follicular patterns not found in other extranodal lymphomas such as those found in the kidney and testis.","['Fellbaum, C', 'Strater, J', 'Hansmann, M L']","['Fellbaum C', 'Strater J', 'Hansmann ML']","['Institute of Pathology, School of Medicine, Technical University of Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Virchows Arch A Pathol Anat Histopathol,"Virchows Archiv.

The present study evaluated serum ALP and PLAP levels to establish a blood-based biochemical index for leukemia patients. STUDY DESIGN: ALP and PLAP levels were determined in 145 untreated leukemia patients, 77 anemia patients, 150 healthy individuals (controls), 47 leukemic patients in remission and 23 patients with persistent leukemic activity/accelerated leukemic phase (P. Leu./A. Leu.). The enzymes were estimated with highly specific spectrophotometric methods. RESULTS: Serum ALP and PLAP levels were significantly elevated in anemia patients and leukemia patients compared to controls. Comparison between anemia patients and leukemia patients showed insignificant differences for ALP, whereas PLAP levels were significantly raised (p < 0.001) in leukemia patients. ALP showed insignificant difference between untreated leukemia patients, patients with P. Leu./A. Leu. and leukemia patients in remission. PLAP levels were comparable in patients with P. Leu./A. Leu. and were significantly lower (p < 0.02) in leukemia patients in remission than in untreated leukemia patients. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that serum PLAP levels are a useful biochemical marker for diagnosis and treatment monitoring of leukemia patients. However, serum ALP levels have limited utility for leukemia patients.","['Patel, P S', 'Adhvaryu, S G', 'Balar, D B']","['Patel PS', 'Adhvaryu SG', 'Balar DB']","['Division of Research, Gujarat Cancer Society, New Civil Hospital Compound, Ahmedabad, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Tumori,Tumori,0111356,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Alkaline Phosphatase/*blood', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*blood', 'Female', 'GPI-Linked Proteins', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/*blood', 'Leukemia/blood/*enzymology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Placenta/*enzymology']",1993/10/31 00:00,1993/10/31 00:01,['1993/10/31 00:00'],"['1993/10/31 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/10/31 00:01 [medline]', '1993/10/31 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Tumori. 1993 Oct 31;79(5):352-6.,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (GPI-Linked Proteins)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', 'EC 3.1.3.1 (Alkaline Phosphatase)', 'EC 3.1.3.1 (alkaline phosphatase, placental)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The identification of such genes ""opens up"" the possibility of genetic diagnosis in families so that individuals who are at risk of cancer through inheriting a predisposing mutation can be identified. Genes that are involved in familial cancer syndromes may also be important in the pathogenesis of sporadic forms of the disease, which are often more common. In the search for genes that predispose to familial breast and ovarian cancer much recent progress has been made. A locus on the long arm of chromosome 17, in the interval 17q12-21, has been identified by genetic linkage, and appears to be responsible for disease in approximately 40% of breast cancer families and most families that contain breast and ovarian cancer. The region containing this locus, which has been called BRCA1, has been narrowed to a 3-4 cM interval defined by THRA1, the thyroid hormone receptor locus alpha, and D17S183, an anonymous microsatellite polymorphism. Loci other than BRCA1 that have been identified appear not only to predispose to breast and/or ovarian tumors, but to tumors at other sites too. A new locus has been identified on chromosome 2 which is linked to hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC). Families with HNPCC are also at risk of endometrial cancer and tumors of the ovary, amongst other cancer sites. Finally, mutations in the p53 gene are inherited in families with Li-Fraumeni syndrome, a rare cancer syndrome predisposing to breast tumors, sarcomas, leukemia and other cancers. Li-Fraumeni syndrome is also the only inherited cancer syndrome that predisposes at least in part to breast cancer where the actual predisposing gene is known. For the other cancer syndromes, the cloning of the predisposing genes is eagerly awaited.","['Smith, S A', 'Ponder, B A']","['Smith SA', 'Ponder BA']","['Department of Pathology, University of Cambridge, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Tumori,Tumori,0111356,IM,"['Ataxia Telangiectasia/genetics', 'Breast Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17', 'Female', 'Genes, p53', 'Humans', 'Mutation', '*Oncogenes', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/*genetics']",1993/10/31 00:00,1993/10/31 00:01,['1993/10/31 00:00'],"['1993/10/31 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/10/31 00:01 [medline]', '1993/10/31 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Tumori. 1993 Oct 31;79(5):291-6.,,,48,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We also analyzed possible correlations with circulating levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and the soluble form of the receptor for interleukin-2 (sIL-2r). Nineteen patients with de novo AML and 14 patients with newly-diagnosed NHL were investigated. Tests for APA included the measurement of anticardiolipin antibodies (ACA) with a solid-phase immunoassay, and the detection of the lupus-like anticoagulant (LA) activity. Five patients with AML (26.3%) and 5 patients with NHL (35.7%) presented elevated APA at diagnosis, as compared to 3 of 174 persons of the control group (p < 0.0001). APA titres became normal in all patients responding to treatment, whereas non-responders retained elevated levels. In addition, 6 patients (4 with AML and 2 with NHL), who had normal APA at diagnosis and were either refractory to treatment or in relapse, subsequently developed LA and/or ACA positivity. At presentation, the mean levels of IgG- and IgM-ACA in patients were not significantly different from controls, and concordance between ACA and LA results reached just 30%. With regard to the clinical course, we were not able to detect any statistically significant difference between patients with normal and elevated APA.

Two patients had no predisposing factors.

Seven patients presented with destruction of the paranasal sinuses and local invasion; three with direct extension to the frontal or temporal lobes. Four patients displayed hematogenous dissemination to the cerebrum, brain stem, and cerebellum from a primary pulmonary focus. The seven patients with sinus involvement were treated with aggressive surgical debridement. Two patients with focal intracerebral lesions underwent either open craniotomy or stereotactic biopsy. Amphotericin B was administered intravenously to all patients. Local irrigation via a percutaneous catheter was performed in the seven patients with sinus disease and in one case of intracranial abscess. All seven patients with intracranial infection died, in contrast to four patients that survived with infection localized to the sinuses and orbits. All survivors had been treated with a combination of surgery and amphotericin B therapy. This review demonstrates that RM is increasingly affecting patients with sources of immunosuppression other than diabetes mellitus.

RESULTS: With one exception in which GS antedated leukemia, GS was present concurrently with onset of leukemia or during remission or relapse. Radiographs, nuclear studies, and US findings were nonspecific. One parascapular GS was hyperintense on T2-weighted MR images, but in all eight central nervous system studies, tumors were isointense to gray matter, muscle, or marrow on T1-weighted images and to white matter or muscle, marrow, or both on T2-weighted images. Contrast enhancement of GS was homogenous on cranial CT scans and all MR studies. CONCLUSION: CT and MR imaging features may allow distinction of GS from hematomas and abscesses, which are also complications of leukemia. Thus, biopsy may be avoided in some patients.","['Pui, M H', 'Fletcher, B D', 'Langston, J W']","['Pui MH', 'Fletcher BD', 'Langston JW']","[""Department of Diagnostic Imaging, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38101.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Radiology,Radiology,0401260,IM,"['Child', 'Diagnosis, Differential', '*Diagnostic Imaging', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*diagnosis/epidemiology/pathology', 'Male', 'Orbital Neoplasms/diagnosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Soft Tissue Neoplasms/diagnosis']",1994/03/01 00:00,1994/03/01 00:01,['1994/03/01 00:00'],"['1994/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1148/radiology.190.3.8115614 [doi]'],ppublish,Radiology. 1994 Mar;190(3):698-702. doi: 10.1148/radiology.190.3.8115614.,,,,,['P30CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We compared recombinant interferon alfa-2a with conventional chemotherapy (hydroxyurea or busulfan) in a trial designed to have a power of 80 percent to detect a difference of 20 percent in median survival between the group given interferon and the group given conventional chemotherapy. Between 1986 and 1988, 322 patients with previously untreated or minimally treated Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myeloid leukemia were randomly assigned to treatment with either interferon alfa-2a (218 patients) or conventional chemotherapy (104 patients). RESULTS: The rate of karyotypic response (defined as > 33 percent of metaphases negative for the Philadelphia chromosome) was 30 percent in the interferon group and 5 percent in the conventional-chemotherapy group (P < 0.001). The time to progression from the chronic phase of leukemia to an accelerated or a blastic phase was longer in the interferon group than in the conventional-chemotherapy group (median, > 72 vs. 45 months; P < 0.001), as was survival (median, 72 vs. 52 months; 6-year survival, 50 percent vs. 29 percent; P = 0.002 for both comparisons). There was one treatment-related death in each group.

Production of GM-CSF by cultured AML cells has been demonstrated, and GM-CSF expression by normal myeloid progenitors has been postulated to play a role in myelopoiesis. We have investigated the regulation of expression of GM-CSF in AML cell lines, and our results demonstrate the presence of a strong constitutive promoter element contained within 53 bp upstream of the cap site. We have also identified a negative regulatory element located immediately upstream of the positive regulatory element (within 69 bp of the cap site) that is active in AML cell lines but not T cells or K562 CML cells.

The macrophage scavenger receptor (SR) gene becomes markedly upregulated during the final stages of monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation and provides a model for the identification and characterization of transcription factors that control this process. In this report, we have identified three genomic regulatory elements that are required for transactivation of the SR gene in the THP-1 monocytic leukemia cell line following induction of macrophage differentiation by tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate. Each of these regulatory elements contains a near-consensus binding site for members of the AP-1 gene family, while the two most quantitatively important elements also contain juxtaposed binding sites for ets domain transcription factors. We demonstrate that tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate treatment results in a marked and prolonged increase in AP-1 binding activity on these elements, which can be accounted for almost entirely by c-jun and junB. These proteins in turn form ternary complexes with additional factors that bind to the adjacent ets recognition motifs. Several indirect lines of evidence indicate that ets2 represents a component of this ternary complex. The combined expression of c-jun, ets2, and a constitutive form of ras result in synergistic increases in transcription from promoters containing the SR regulatory elements. These observations suggest that SR gene expression is regulated via a signal transduction pathway involving ras, AP-1, and ets domain proteins and imply that at least some of the signalling components involved in ras-dependent growth are also utilized to promote the expression of genes involved in terminal differentiation.","['Wu, H', 'Moulton, K', 'Horvai, A', 'Parik, S', 'Glass, C K']","['Wu H', 'Moulton K', 'Horvai A', 'Parik S', 'Glass CK']","['Division of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla 92093-0656.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Nucleus/physiology', '*DNA-Binding Proteins', '*Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes, jun', 'Humans', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Macrophages/*physiology', '*Membrane Proteins', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides/chemistry', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Protein c-ets-2', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun/*physiology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*physiology', '*Receptors, Lipoprotein', 'Receptors, Scavenger', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid', '*Repressor Proteins', 'Scavenger Receptors, Class B', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', '*Trans-Activators', '*Transcription Factors']",1994/03/01 00:00,1994/03/01 00:01,['1994/03/01 00:00'],"['1994/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/mcb.14.3.2129-2139.1994 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1994 Mar;14(3):2129-39. doi: 10.1128/mcb.14.3.2129-2139.1994.,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (ERF protein, human)', '0 (ETS2 protein, human)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Protein c-ets-2)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Lipoprotein)', '0 (Receptors, Scavenger)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Scarb1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Scavenger Receptors, Class B)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,,,"['SR', 'ets2', 'jun', 'junB']",,,PMC358573,,,,,,,,,,

Northern (RNA) blot analysis identified His-1 transcripts in four transformed myeloid cell lines but in no normal tissues examined. Two of these cell lines were derived from retrovirus-induced myeloid leukemias that harbor integrated proviruses which drive His-1 gene expression by promoter insertion. The two other cell lines expressed a discrete 3-kb His-1 RNA that is derived from a novel gene consisting of three exons that span 6 kb on mouse chromosome 2. The His-1 gene is conserved as a single-copy sequence in multiple vertebrate species and is expressed as a spliced and polyadenylated RNA. A protein-coding region is not evident from analysis of the His-1 sequence because of the presence of multiple small open reading frames, none of which are greater than 219 bp.

Daily cocaine administration induced a significant decrease in the number of IgA+ cells with a concomitant increase in the number of CD8+ cells per villi in the ILP. Murine retrovirus infection alone decreased the number of IgA+ and CD4+ cells in the ILP, and this decreased was even more marked when MAIDS mice also received cocaine.

However, the incidence of MRSA infections has increased in patients with hematopoietic malignancies, since preventive, multi-drug administration of antibiotics is frequently used in these patients. Moreover, patients with hematopoietic malignancies complicated by MRSA pneumonia have a poor prognosis. We examined lymphocyte subpopulations in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) in MRSA pneumonia-complicated patients with hematopoietic malignancies and studied their relationship with the clinical features. We also discuss the cause of their poor prognosis. Of 223 patients with hematopoietic malignancies, 18 (8.1%) were complicated by MRSA pneumonia. Many of those patients had lymphoid malignancies. MRSA pneumonia occurred when neutrophil count was decreased. Most patients had been treated with chemotherapy containing anticancer drugs or with corticosteroid therapy. They had also been treated with third generation cefem antibiotics. We studied lymphocyte subsets in BALF in MRSA pneumonia-complicated patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and observed the local changes of the pulmonary immunological system due to NHL itself and due to anti-lymphoma chemotherapy.

RESULTS: In all, 146 patients developed a SC, compared with 41.9 cases expected on the basis of incidence rates in the general population (relative risk [RR], 3.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.9 to 4.1). The mean 20-year actuarial risk of all SCs was 20% (95% CI, 17% to 24%). Significantly increased RRs were observed for leukemia (RR, 34.7; 95% CI, 23.6 to 49.3), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) (RR, 20.6; 95% CI, 13.1 to 30.9), lung cancer (RR, 3.7; 95% CI, 2.5 to 5.3), all gastrointestinal cancers combined (RR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.2 to 3.1), all urogenital cancers combined (RR, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.4 to 3.7), melanoma (RR, 4.9; 95% CI, 1.6 to 11.3), and soft tissue sarcoma (RR, 8.8; 95% CI, 1.8 to 25.8). As compared with the general population, the cohort experienced an excess of 63 cancer cases per 10,000 person-years. Cox-model analysis indicated the following as significant risk factors for developing leukemia: first-year treatment with chemotherapy (CT), follow-up treatment with CT, age at diagnosis of HD greater than 40 years, splenectomy, and advanced stage. Patients treated with CT in the 1980s had a substantially lower risk of leukemia than patients treated in the 1970s (10-year actuarial risks of 2.1% and 6.4%, respectively; P = .07). Significant risk factors for NHL were older age, male sex, and combined modality treatment as compared with either modality alone. Risk of lung cancer was strongly related to radiotherapy (RT), while an additional role of CT could not be demonstrated. After more than 15 years of follow-up, women treated with mantle-field irradiation before age 20 years had a greater than forty-fold increased risk of breast cancer (P < .001). CONCLUSION: While the long-term consequences of HD treatment as administered in the 1960s and 1970s are still evolving, it is promising that patients who received the new treatment regimens introduced in the 1980s have a much lower leukemia risk than patients treated in earlier years. Beginning 10 years after initial RT, the follow-up program of women who received mantle-field irradiation before age 30 years should routinely include breast palpation and yearly mammography.","['van Leeuwen, F E', 'Klokman, W J', 'Hagenbeek, A', 'Noyon, R', 'van den Belt-Dusebout, A W', 'van Kerkhoff, E H', 'van Heerde, P', 'Somers, R']","['van Leeuwen FE', 'Klokman WJ', 'Hagenbeek A', 'Noyon R', 'van den Belt-Dusebout AW', 'van Kerkhoff EH', 'van Heerde P', 'Somers R']","['Department of Epidemiology, Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Actuarial Analysis', 'Adult', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hodgkin Disease/radiotherapy/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Netherlands/epidemiology', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Radiotherapy/adverse effects/methods', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Analysis']",1994/02/01 00:00,1994/02/01 00:01,['1994/02/01 00:00'],"['1994/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1994.12.2.312 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1994 Feb;12(2):312-25. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1994.12.2.312.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We reviewed the CSF examinations of patients with intermediate-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) to determine the clinical significance of blast cells reported in the cytocentrifuge when the total CSF cell count was normal. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Children treated on CCG-105 for ALL had CSF examinations every 12 weeks during maintenance therapy. The outcome of children who had a positive CSF cytocentrifuge examination without an elevated CSF WBC count was compared with that of children who did not have any CSF blast cells observed. RESULTS: Sixty-four patients had 81 CSF examinations with blast cells and a normal cell count. By Cox life-table regression analysis, patients with blasts had a different disease-free survival (DFS) distribution, with relapses tending to occur earlier (P = .008). However, the DFS for these patients was 63% +/- 9.6% at 5 years from the time of the abnormal cytocentrifuge result as compared with 69% +/- 1.5% for 1,490 children who did not have blasts in their CSF. This difference is not significant. CONCLUSION: Blast cells were infrequently identified in cytocentrifuge preparations of CSF when the cell count was normal. The majority of patients in whom such an event was observed have not experienced a subsequent relapse as measured by life-table analysis at 5 years. The data do not justify changing or augmenting therapy based on cytocentrifuge results alone.","['Tubergen, D G', 'Cullen, J W', 'Boyett, J M', 'Gilchrist, G S', ""O'Brien, R T"", 'Coccia, P F', 'Waskerwitz, M J']","['Tubergen DG', 'Cullen JW', 'Boyett JM', 'Gilchrist GS', ""O'Brien RT"", 'Coccia PF', 'Waskerwitz MJ']","['M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Centrifugation/instrumentation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytological Techniques/instrumentation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Life Tables', '*Lymphocytes', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*cerebrospinal fluid/*therapy', 'Treatment Outcome']",1994/02/01 00:00,1994/02/01 00:01,['1994/02/01 00:00'],"['1994/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1994.12.2.273 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1994 Feb;12(2):273-8. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1994.12.2.273.,,,,,"['CA 02971/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 13539/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 17829/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Seventy-eight consecutive AML patients younger than 40 years of age were treated according to a prospective protocol in which every patient in complete remission (CR) with an HLA-identical sibling was scheduled to receive BMT rather than intensive chemotherapy consolidation. To minimize comparison biases, the availability or not of an HLA-identical sibling donor was considered to be the equivalent of genetic randomization to the BMT or chemotherapy arm, respectively. RESULTS: Fifty-eight patients (74%) achieved a CR. A donor was found for 27 patients (BMT arm), and 20 of these patients were actually transplanted in first CR. The 31 patients without a donor were allocated to the chemotherapy arm. Patients in the two arms had similar disease characteristics at diagnosis and previous responses to induction therapy. The cumulative risk of relapse was 43% +/- 24% in the BMT arm and 67% +/- 19% in the chemotherapy arm (P = .01). The 7-year leukemia-free survival (LFS) rate was 41% +/- 20% in the BMT arm and 27% +/- 16% in the chemotherapy arm, a difference that is not statistically significant between the two arms. The overall survival rates were 41% +/- 20% and 46% +/- 19%, respectively. CONCLUSION: In this study, the availability of an HLA-identical sibling donor was not associated with a better survival rate because of both the impossibility of some patients with a donor to receive BMT and the more efficient salvage treatment of patients who relapsed after intensive consolidation chemotherapy than of patients who relapsed after BMT.","['Archimbaud, E', 'Thomas, X', 'Michallet, M', 'Jaubert, J', 'Troncy, J', 'Guyotat, D', 'Fiere, D']","['Archimbaud E', 'Thomas X', 'Michallet M', 'Jaubert J', 'Troncy J', 'Guyotat D', 'Fiere D']","[""Service d'Hematologie, Hopital Edouard Herriot, Lyon, France.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Controlled Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/genetics/*therapy', 'Male', 'Prospective Studies', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",1994/02/01 00:00,1994/02/01 00:01,['1994/02/01 00:00'],"['1994/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1994.12.2.262 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1994 Feb;12(2):262-7. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1994.12.2.262.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study examined whether transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta), a potent inhibitor of lymphocyte proliferation may play a role in the growth regulation of CLL B cells. CLL B cells from all donors treated expressed detectable TGF-beta 1 mRNA. In vitro release of TGF-beta by unstimulated cultures, or cultures stimulated by antibody to cell surface immunoglobulin (anti-mu) plus phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) was higher in CLL than in normal B cells. High levels of TGF-beta activity were also detected in plasma samples of CLL patients. The role of TGF-beta in growth regulation of CLL B cells was tested in assays using different B cell activators. Purified neoplastic B cells from most CLL patients proliferated in response to anti-mu, or the combination of anti-mu plus PMA. Levels of CLL B cell proliferation were lower than observed in normal B cells. Some CLL were refractory to these stimuli. Antibody to CD40 induced proliferation of CLL B cells from all donors tested when presented on Fc gamma RII (CDw32)-expressing L cells. Neutralizing antibodies to TGF-beta increased CLL B cell proliferation in the absence or presence of additional stimuli. These effects were dose dependent and specific. Exogenous TGF-beta completely inhibited CLL B cell proliferation induced by anti-mu, PMA, and anti-TGF-beta. CLL B cell proliferation induced by anti-CD40 was reduced by exogenous TGF-beta. However, even at high doses, TGF-beta did not completely inhibit the anti-CD40 effect. In summary, TGF-beta is overexpressed in CLL. CLL B cells are sensitive to TGF-beta and this cytokine functions as an autocrine growth inhibitor accounting at least in part for reduced proliferative responses of these leukemic cells and for the slow progression of the malignant process in vivo.","['Lotz, M', 'Ranheim, E', 'Kipps, T J']","['Lotz M', 'Ranheim E', 'Kipps TJ']","['Sam and Rose Stein Institute for Research on Aging, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla 92093.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,IM,"['Aged', 'Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/drug effects/*immunology/pathology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*blood/immunology/pathology', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphocyte Depletion', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Neutralization Tests', 'Rabbits/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Thymidine/metabolism', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/blood/immunology/*physiology']",1994/03/01 00:00,1994/03/01 00:01,['1994/03/01 00:00'],"['1994/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.179.3.999 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1994 Mar 1;179(3):999-1004. doi: 10.1084/jem.179.3.999.,"['0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",,,,"['CA-51406/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-54755/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'RR-00833/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,PMC2191408,,,,,,,,,,

Unlike classical class I antigens, TL antigens are not known to be targets of cytotoxic T cells or to mediate graft rejection. Whereas classical class I antigens function as antigen-presenting molecules to T cell receptors (TCR), the role of TL is yet to be defined. To elucidate the function of TL, we have derived transgenic mice expressing TL in most tissues including skin by introducing a TL gene, T3b of C57BL/6 mouse origin, driven by the H-2Kb promoter. By grafting the skin of transgenic mice, we demonstrate that TL can serve as a transplantation antigen and mediate a TCR-alpha/beta+ CD8+ cytotoxic T cell response. This T cell recognition of TL does not require antigen presentation by H-2 molecules. Furthermore, we show that C57BL/6 F1 mice develop CD8+ T cells that are cytotoxic for C57BL/6 TL+ leukemia cells, providing further support for the concept that aberrantly expressed nonmutated proteins such as TL can be recognized as tumor antigens.","['Morita, A', 'Takahashi, T', 'Stockert, E', 'Nakayama, E', 'Tsuji, T', 'Matsudaira, Y', 'Old, L J', 'Obata, Y']","['Morita A', 'Takahashi T', 'Stockert E', 'Nakayama E', 'Tsuji T', 'Matsudaira Y', 'Old LJ', 'Obata Y']","['Laboratory of Immunology, Aichi Cancer Center Research Institute, Nagoya, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'CD8 Antigens/immunology', 'Crosses, Genetic', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Female', 'H-2 Antigens/genetics', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/immunology', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/biosynthesis/genetics/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/immunology', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Skin/immunology', 'Skin Transplantation/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/03/01 00:00,1994/03/01 00:01,['1994/03/01 00:00'],"['1994/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.179.3.777 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1994 Mar 1;179(3):777-84. doi: 10.1084/jem.179.3.777.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (CD8 Antigens)', '0 (H-2 Antigens)', '0 (H-2Kb protein, mouse)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (thymus-leukemia antigens)']",,,,,,,,PMC2191422,,,,,,,,,,

They are essential for the antimicrobial activity of these cells and they provide important markers for the differentiation stage of the myeloid series and for the diagnosis of myeloid leukemias. In acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) there is high production of myeloperoxidase, and its cytochemical detection as well as the t(15;17) chromosomal translocation are important markers in the diagnosis of this acute myelogenous disease. The expression of other granule protein genes in APL has not been systematically determined. We have used the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method to determine the pattern of expression of granule protein genes at the mRNA level in APL cells. We have examined the expression of the primary granule proteins defensin, myeloperoxidase, elastase, and cathepsin G; the secondary granule proteins lactoferrin, collagenase, and transcobalamin; as well as lysozyme, a protein reportedly found in both primary and secondary granules. mRNAs for all of these granule proteins were present in normal bone marrow mononuclear cells. We found that APL cells from three patients contain, in addition to myeloperoxidase mRNA, mRNAs for elastase, cathepsin G, and lysozyme. One patient had faint but detectable lactoferrin mRNA signal, but collagenase and transcobalamin mRNAs were not detectable in this patient. Defensin mRNA was found in one of the three APL patients, and all the primary granule protein mRNAs measured were found to be expressed in the APL cell line NB4. None of the secondary granule protein mRNAs measured were detectable in NB4 cells. After treatment with retinoic acid (RA), which induces neutrophil maturation of these cells, weak induction of lactoferrin and collagenase but not transcobalamin was observed. However, in view of the weak transcobalamin signal observed in normal bone marrow, the absence of transcobalamin in RA-induced NB4 cells must be interpreted with caution. Interestingly, elastase and cathepsin G mRNA disappeared after RA induction, whereas defensin and myeloperoxidase mRNAs remained present. These findings indicate that granule protein mRNAs are regulated separately and differently, and that only minimal expression of secondary granule protein genes can occur in APL cells.","['Hirata, R K', 'Chen, S T', 'Weil, S C']","['Hirata RK', 'Chen ST', 'Weil SC']","['Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Cardeza Foundation, Thomas Jefferson University Medical College, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19107.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Hematol Pathol,Hematologic pathology,8707764,IM,"['Actins/biosynthesis', 'Base Sequence', 'Blood Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Cathepsins/biosynthesis', 'Collagenases/biosynthesis', 'DNA, Complementary', 'Defensins', 'Humans', 'Lactoferrin/biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Muramidase/biosynthesis', 'Pancreatic Elastase/biosynthesis', 'Peroxidase/biosynthesis', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Protein Biosynthesis', 'RNA, Messenger/*analysis', 'Transcobalamins/biosynthesis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Hematol Pathol. 1993;7(4):225-38.,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Blood Proteins)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Defensins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transcobalamins)', 'EC 1.11.1.7 (Peroxidase)', 'EC 3.2.1.17 (Muramidase)', 'EC 3.4.- (Cathepsins)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Lactoferrin)', 'EC 3.4.21.36 (Pancreatic Elastase)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (Collagenases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, MC-1 leukemic cell-induced platelet aggregation was associated with a significant increase in thromboxane B2 (TXB2) secretion, quantified by RIA, but a decrease in leukotriene B4 (LTB-4) secretion compared to incubations of tumor cells alone. Whereas MC-1 cells also activated platelets as observed by a significant increase in scanning electron-microscopic spheroidal forms distributed throughout the platelet pool, increasing concentrations of IL-2-activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), but not IL-2 or PBMC alone, reversed this effect with a reduction in activated spheroidal forms. The addition of IL-2-activated PBMC to MC-1 platelet incubations inhibited platelet-tumor cell adhesion and suppressed MC-1-induced aggregation. In order to investigate the mechanism resulting in inhibition of MC-1-induced platelet aggregation, short-term PRP-MC-1 preparations were incubated with IL-2-activated PBMC and assayed for TXB2 and LTB-4 by RIA. LTB-4 levels were significantly elevated in these preparations while levels of TXB2 were significantly reduced compared with control platelet-rich plasma (PRP)-MC-1 incubations. Our results showed that inhibition of MC-1-induced platelet activation, aggregation and tumor-platelet adhesion by the addition of IL-2-activated PBMC was consequent to a cellular effect of IL-2 on PBMC. These findings may be important in understanding the observed antimetastatic effect of IL-2.","['Oleksowicz, L', 'Zuckerman, D', 'Lomazova, K D', 'Buryachkofska, L E', 'Astrina, O C', 'Slavina, E G']","['Oleksowicz L', 'Zuckerman D', 'Lomazova KD', 'Buryachkofska LE', 'Astrina OC', 'Slavina EG']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Montefiore Hospital and Medical Center, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Invasion Metastasis,Invasion & metastasis,8202435,IM,"['Adult', '*Cell Aggregation/drug effects/physiology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology/*physiology', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/drug effects/*physiology', 'Leukotriene B4/metabolism', 'Male', 'Microscopy, Electron, Scanning', 'Platelet Activation/drug effects/physiology', 'Platelet Aggregation/drug effects/physiology', 'Radioimmunoassay', 'Thromboxane B2/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Invasion Metastasis. 1993;13(3):119-31.,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '1HGW4DR56D (Leukotriene B4)', '54397-85-2 (Thromboxane B2)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To this end, we have investigated the in vivo phenotypic characteristics and the in vitro natural-killer(NK)-cell susceptibility of a group of MCF-247-induced AKR/J T-cell lymphomas with different leukemic potential. We found that in the AKR/J model, the biological aggressiveness of leukemic cells is not dependent upon an escape from host immune surveillance as a consequence of an in vivo down-regulation of H2-Kk determinants or a resistance to NK lysis. Moreover, NK susceptibility of AKR/J lymphomas does not seem to correlate with the level of H2-antigen expression. No obvious correlation was found between the leukemic phenotype and the amount of MEL-14, LFA-1, ICAM-1, Pgp-1/CD44 and THAM/CD26 antigen expression. An in vivo coordinated up-regulation of alpha 4 and beta 7 integrin chains, with the highest levels of expression detected in secondary sites of leukemic infiltration, was observed in the highly leukemic lymphoma NQ22 and, albeit to a lesser extent, in lymphomas with moderate leukemic potential. Conversely, non-leukemic lymphomas were repeatedly alpha 4- and beta 7-negative. These findings suggest that in the AKR/J system the expression of alpha 4 beta 7 integrin may contribute to leukemic spreading of T-cell lymphomas.","['Dolcetti, R', 'Frisan, T', 'Palmieri, G', 'Rizzo, S', 'Maestro, R', 'Santoni, A', 'Boiocchi, M']","['Dolcetti R', 'Frisan T', 'Palmieri G', 'Rizzo S', 'Maestro R', 'Santoni A', 'Boiocchi M']","['Department of Experimental Oncology 1, Centro di Riferimento Oncologico, Aviano (PN), Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,IM,"['Animals', 'Female', 'H-2 Antigens/analysis', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/analysis', 'Integrins/immunology/*physiology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology/pathology', 'Leukemia/*immunology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/*immunology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred AKR', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', '*Phenotype']",1994/02/15 00:00,1994/02/15 00:01,['1994/02/15 00:00'],"['1994/02/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/02/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/02/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.2910560416 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1994 Feb 15;56(4):560-7. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910560416.,"['0 (H-2 Antigens)', '0 (H-2K(K) antigen)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (Integrins)', '0 (integrin alpha4beta7)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All 3 T-cell lines engrafted and proliferated to form tumors in the mice and showed dissemination patterns in the SCID mouse comparable to those of T-ALL in man: i.e., human cells were detectable by flow cytometry or were cultured from mouse bone marrow, spleen, liver or thymus. CEM, which is the most immature T-cell line, readily formed tumors after injection of cells. The more mature T-cell lines, SUP-T3 and MOLT-4f, required a longer time period, even after injection of higher cell numbers. Whereas no changes in the configuration of the rearranged T-cell receptor genes were detected, striking phenotypic changes were observed in all 3 leukemias growing in the SCID mice after injection. SCID-CEM cells showed an increase in the surface expression of CD3 and CD8 and a decrease in the expression of CD1 and CD71 (transferrin-receptor). SCID-MOLT-4f cells showed an increase in CD5 and CD8 expression and a decrease in CD45RA expression. SCID-SUP-T3 cells showed increased expression of CD8 and CD45RA. Apparently, the mouse environment caused changes in cell-surface antigen expression on the T-ALL-derived T-cell lines. Some immunophenotypic changes remained stable during subsequent growth in culture of SUP-T3 cells, suggesting that maturation of the cell line occurred in vivo. The other cell lines, CEM and MOLT-4f after undergoing in vivo-induced changes, reverted to the original immunophenotype, suggesting transitory activation in vivo. These data point out the importance of stromal factors in defining growth and maturation of human leukemic cells in vivo, in SCID mice.","['Uittenbogaart, C H', 'Anisman, D J', 'Tary-Lehmann, M', 'Vollger, L W', 'Breit, T M', 'Van Dongen, J J', 'Saxon, A']","['Uittenbogaart CH', 'Anisman DJ', 'Tary-Lehmann M', 'Vollger LW', 'Breit TM', 'Van Dongen JJ', 'Saxon A']","['Department of Pediatrics, UCLA School of Medicine 90024-1747.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,IM,"['Animals', 'CD4 Antigens/analysis', 'CD8 Antigens/analysis', 'Cell Division', 'Humans', '*Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*immunology/pathology', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens/analysis', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/02/15 00:00,1994/02/15 00:01,['1994/02/15 00:00'],"['1994/02/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/02/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/02/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.2910560414 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1994 Feb 15;56(4):546-51. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910560414.,"['0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (CD8 Antigens)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)']",,,,"['CA 12800/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 16042/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 42735/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The lymph nodes of all three states were composed of unvarying CD4 positive T cells. Most of the lymph nodes with ATLL consistently presented alpha V 2 antigen, but no others. In HTLV-I associated lymphadenitis, only a few cells reacted for alpha V 2, as in non-specific lymphadenitis without ATLL features. One of three cases with incipient ATLL presented alpha V 2.

Five of 15 patients with ATL (33.3 per cent) have had at least one other associated neoplasm in comparison to only 44 of 1156 patients with other forms of hematological malignancy (3.8 per cent). The incidence figures for secondary neoplasms associated with the other hematologic malignancies were 4.3 per cent (16/370) for acute non-lymphocytic leukemia (ANLL), 2.2 per cent (2/90) for acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), 4.8 per cent (1/21) for acute unclassifiable leukemia, 2.2 per cent (5/225) for chronic myelogenous leukemia, 4.7 per cent (2/43) for chronic lymphocytic leukemia, 5.9 per cent (8/136) for malignant monoclonal gammopathy and 3.7 per cent (10/271) for malignant lymphoma. The incidence of multiple neoplasms in patients with ATL in comparison to those with other hematological malignancies was statistically significant (p < 0.01 or p < 0.001). The neoplasms associated with ATL have been adenocarcinoma of the thyroid or stomach, and squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx, lip or lung. We identified ATL-derived factor (ADF) in the cytoplasm of the secondary neoplasms of the ATL patients by means of indirect immunofluoroscopy and immunohistochemical techniques utilizing anti-ADF antibody. We also identified ras p21 products in these neoplasms by means of p21 ras monoclonal antibody studies. The possibility that HTLV-I was the cause of the secondary neoplasms thus was investigated.

Such polypeptides include Grb2, which comprises a single Src homology 2 (SH2) domain flanked by two SH3 domains, and the 66, 52 and 46 kDa Shc proteins which possess an SH2 domain in their carboxy-terminus. Grb2 associates with tyrosine phosphorylated proteins through its SH2 domain, and with the Ras guanine nucleotide releasing protein mSos1 through its SH3 domains. mSos1 stimulates conversion of the inactive GDP-bound form of Ras to the active GTP-bound state. In bcr-abl-transformed cells, Grb2 and mSos1 formed a physical complex with Bcr-Abl. In vitro, the Grb2 SH2 domain bound Bcr-Abl through recognition of a tyrosine phosphorylation site within the amino-terminal bcr-encoded sequence (p.Tyr177-Val-Asn-Val), that is common to both Bcr-Abl proteins. These results suggest that autophosphorylation within the Bcr element of Bcr-Abl creates a direct physical link to Grb2-mSos1, and potentially to the Ras pathway, and thereby modifies the target specificity of the Abl tyrosine kinase.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Puil, L', 'Liu, J', 'Gish, G', 'Mbamalu, G', 'Bowtell, D', 'Pelicci, P G', 'Arlinghaus, R', 'Pawson, T']","['Puil L', 'Liu J', 'Gish G', 'Mbamalu G', 'Bowtell D', 'Pelicci PG', 'Arlinghaus R', 'Pawson T']","['Division of Molecular and Developmental Biology, Samuel Lunenfeld Research Institute, Mount Sinai Hospital, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,IM,"['*Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*metabolism', 'GRB2 Adaptor Protein', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oncogene Protein p21(ras)/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proteins/*metabolism/physiology', '*Signal Transduction', 'Tyrosine/metabolism']",1994/02/15 00:00,1994/02/15 00:01,['1994/02/15 00:00'],"['1994/02/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/02/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/02/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,EMBO J. 1994 Feb 15;13(4):764-73.,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (GRB2 Adaptor Protein)', '0 (Grb2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Proteins)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Oncogene Protein p21(ras))']",,,,['CA16672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['abl', 'bcr']",,,PMC394874,,,,,,,,,,

Prognosis is poor. Published data regarding the treatment of NHL in patients with AT suggested that these children respond poorly to therapy. The authors report on an infant with AT with mediastinal high-grade T-NHL who remained in continuous complete remission after chemotherapy. Diagnosis of AT was established after tumor diagnosis. METHODS AND RESULTS: The 7-month-old boy was treated according to the acute lymphoblastic leukemia-Berlin, Frankfurt, Munster 86 protocol. The therapeutic response was prompt, but therapy had to be stopped because of severe side effects. Surprisingly, the boy remained in a stable complete remission for 3 1/2 years. Then tumors in both kidneys occurred and the child died a few months later. Postmortem examination demonstrated large tumors in both kidneys caused by a low-grade malignant lymphoma of B-cell lineage. CONCLUSION: Congenital immune deficiency should be ruled out at diagnosis of rare malignancies in respect to age. NHL in patients with AT can be cured, but poor tolerance to chemotherapy has to be considered. Patients whose disease has been cured may be at high risk for development of a second independent malignancy.","['Overberg-Schmidt, U', 'Wegner, R D', 'Baumgarten, E', 'Gunther, A', 'Ebell, W', 'Stein, H', 'Vogel, M', 'Henze, G']","['Overberg-Schmidt U', 'Wegner RD', 'Baumgarten E', 'Gunther A', 'Ebell W', 'Stein H', 'Vogel M', 'Henze G']","['Universitatsklinikum Rudolf Virchow, Standort Wedding, Kinderklinik, Hamatologie/Onkologie, Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['Ataxia Telangiectasia/*complications', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Kidney Neoplasms/etiology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*etiology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/drug therapy/*etiology', 'Male', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*etiology', 'Remission Induction']",1994/03/01 00:00,1994/03/01 00:01,['1994/03/01 00:00'],"['1994/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19940301)73:5<1522::aid-cncr2820730533>3.0.co;2-t [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1994 Mar 1;73(5):1522-5. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19940301)73:5<1522::aid-cncr2820730533>3.0.co;2-t.,,['Cancer. 1994 Sep 1;74(5):1649-50.

Because malignant lymphocytes have characteristic surface antigens, the role of monoclonal antibodies is worthy of intensive investigation. METHODS: Five patients with refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia were treated with a novel radioimmunoconjugate, 131I-Lym-1, reactive with antigenic sites on malignant B lymphocytes. 131I-Lym-1 was given to the patients in doses of 20-65 mCi at 2-6-week intervals. RESULTS: Radioimmunoconjugate treatment using 131I-Lym-1 induced objective responses with dramatic reduction in lymphadenopathy and, in two patients, normalization of leukocyte counts. However, lymphocytes continued to be the dominate cells in the peripheral blood and bone marrow. Because these patients had advanced disease associated with preexisting peripheral cytopenias, requiring repeated transfusions, and recurrent infections, hematopoietic toxicity from 131I-Lym-1 was difficult to evaluate. The patients seemed to tolerate at least 200 mCi of 131I given at these dose levels, and intervals before toxicity added to their existing peripheral cytopenias. Radionuclide doses in excess of 300 mCi aggravated preexisting thrombocytopenia. CONCLUSION: Although the data raise the possibility of a role for 131I-Lym-1 monoclonal antibody in the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, strategies to address the radionuclide-induced thrombocytopenia are essential before this intervention can become a clinically useful therapeutic modality for chronic lymphocytic leukemia.","['DeNardo, G L', 'Lewis, J P', 'DeNardo, S J', ""O'Grady, L F""]","['DeNardo GL', 'Lewis JP', 'DeNardo SJ', ""O'Grady LF""]","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, School of Medicine, University of California, Davis.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*administration & dosage', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains/immunology', 'Immunotoxins/*administration & dosage', 'Iodine Radioisotopes/administration & dosage', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/immunology/*radiotherapy', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Middle Aged', 'Pilot Projects', 'Radioimmunotherapy/*methods', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",1994/03/01 00:00,1994/03/01 00:01,['1994/03/01 00:00'],"['1994/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19940301)73:5<1425::aid-cncr2820730517>3.0.co;2-d [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1994 Mar 1;73(5):1425-32. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19940301)73:5<1425::aid-cncr2820730517>3.0.co;2-d.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '0 (Iodine Radioisotopes)']",,,,['CA47829/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In vivo administration of IL-11 in mice, rats and nonhuman primates has demonstrated the thrombopoietic effects of this cytokine. The expression of the human IL-11 gene, which is localized at 19q13.3-13.4, can be controlled at both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. Initial biochemical characterization has identified a 151 kD protein as the potential IL-11 binding subunit of the receptor complex. Like other cytokines such as IL-6, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), oncostatin M (ONC) and ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), IL-11 has been shown to utilize IL-6 signal transducer, gp130. Because of the overlapping biological activities, the similarities in the predicted tertiary structures, and the sharing of common signal transducer protein, we have compared the signal transduction pathways mediated by these cytokines in various cell types. Studies of protein tyrosine phosphorylation, primary response gene expression and signaling molecules known to be important in transducing mitogenic signals have suggested that there are convergent and divergent points along the signal transduction pathways utilized by IL-11, IL-6, LIF and ONC.

Eighteen acute lymphoid or myeloid leukemias, three chronic lymphocytic leukemias, and three chronic myelogenous leukemias as well as 12 malignant non-Hodgkin's lymphomas mostly showed extremely skewed clonal X inactivation (median allelic cleavage ratio [ACR] of unmethylated/inactive M27 beta alleles was 50, range 1 to 100) or hypermethylation of both alleles. Two lymphomas showed random M27 beta X inactivation but clonal antigen-receptor gene rearrangements. In normal peripheral blood leukocytes from 105 healthy females aged 2 to 96 years, the median ACR was 2 (range 1 to 100). Thus, it was significantly lower than in the leukemias (P = .0001, Mann-Whitney test), but extremely skewed patterns (ACR > 10.8, ie, > 80th percentile) were seen not only in the leukemias but also in 21/105 samples (20%) of normal leukocytes, and significantly more frequent in a population of elderly women (aged 75 to 96 years) compared with healthy children (aged 2 to 8 years) and younger women (aged 20 to 58 years) (P = .00125; chi 2 test). We conclude that in a population of cells derived from the hematopoietic system where clonality is uncertain, skewed M27 beta patterns are not reliable indicators for the presence of a clonal neoplastic disorder.

After allogeneic HLA-identical BMT, donor-derived cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) directed at minor histocompatibility (mH) antigens on the recipients, tissues can be shown. To evaluate the antileukemic reactivity of mH antigen-specific CTLs, we analyzed the expression of mH antigens on circulating lymphocytic and myeloid leukemic cells. We show that the defined mH specificities HA-1 through HA-5 and H-Y are present on leukemic cells, indicating that mH antigen-specific CTLs are capable of HLA class I-restricted antigen-specific lysis of leukemic cells. Compared with interleukin-2-stimulated normal lymphocytes, leukemic cells of lymphocytic origin are less susceptible to T-cell-mediated cytotoxicity by the HA-2 mH antigen-specific CTL and the anti-HLA-A2 CTL clone. A possible explanation for this phenomenon is impaired expression of the LFA-1 adhesion molecule. Our study suggests that mH antigen-specific HLA class I-restricted CD8+ CTLs may be involved in the graft-versus-leukemia reactivity after allogeneic BMT.","['van der Harst, D', 'Goulmy, E', 'Falkenburg, J H', 'Kooij-Winkelaar, Y M', 'van Luxemburg-Heijs, S A', 'Goselink, H M', 'Brand, A']","['van der Harst D', 'Goulmy E', 'Falkenburg JH', 'Kooij-Winkelaar YM', 'van Luxemburg-Heijs SA', 'Goselink HM', 'Brand A']","['Department of Immunohematology and Bloodbank, University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antigens, CD/analysis/biosynthesis/blood', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/blood/*immunology', 'Clone Cells', 'HLA-A Antigens/*analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/blood/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Prolymphocytic/blood/immunology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/blood/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology']",1994/02/15 00:00,1994/02/15 00:01,['1994/02/15 00:00'],"['1994/02/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/02/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/02/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)75736-8 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1994 Feb 15;83(4):1060-6.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (HLA-A Antigens)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Conventional antifungal agents have limited activity and a narrow therapeutic index. In an open-label study we assessed the activity of an oral triazole, SCH 39304, in the treatment of refractory life-threatening mold infections in 50 patients with cancer, most of whom had previously received amphotericin B and/or fluconazole. SCH 39304 was given at a daily dose of 200-400 mg for a median of 8 weeks. The overall rate of response was 79% among 34 evaluable patients, with a complete response in 22 instances and a partial response in 5. Some patients responded despite persistent, profound immunosuppression. Three patients developed relapses, and two developed fungal superinfections. SCH 39304 was well tolerated. We conclude that oral triazoles such as SCH 39304 may represent effective and safe treatment of mold infections in immunosuppressed patients, at least after standard antifungal chemotherapy. Unfortunately, the carcinogenic potential of SCH 39304 in animals has precluded its development. Our hope is that analogues with similar efficacy but without carcinogenic potential can be developed.","['Anaissie, E J', 'Kontoyiannis, D P', 'Vartivarian, S', 'Kantarjian, H M', ""O'Brien, S"", 'Giralt, S A', 'Andersson, B S', 'Karl, C', 'Champlin, R E', 'Bodey, G P']","['Anaissie EJ', 'Kontoyiannis DP', 'Vartivarian S', 'Kantarjian HM', ""O'Brien S"", 'Giralt SA', 'Andersson BS', 'Karl C', 'Champlin RE', 'Bodey GP']","['Department of Medical Specialties, University of Texas M.

Recently, a new formulation has become available, encapsulated in liposomes (Amph-lip). This new form of administration was developed in order to lower the acute side effects and to offer the possibility of administering high doses of amphotericin B. Experience with Amph-lip is limited, especially in children. We treated four children with documented systemic fungal infections with Amph-lip and administered it empirically to 12 children. Fifteen of these 16 children were severely granulocytopenic oncologic patients. One 3-month-old baby suffered from systemic candidiasis. Amph-lip was preferred to conventional Amph-B in children with organ dysfunction developing as a consequence of conventional chemotherapy or bone marrow transplantation, after failure of conventional Amph-B to improve a fungal infection, and after adverse drug reactions had occurred. The daily doses of Amph-lip ranged from 1 to 6 mg/kg (median 3 mg/kg), the cumulative doses from 13 to 311 mg/kg (median 75 mg/kg). Acute adverse reactions or organ function abnormalities attributable to Amph-lip did not occur in 402 administrations. Amph-lip has proven to be well tolerated by children in terms of acute toxicity and in the long term. Although large cumulative doses were given, organ function abnormalities attributable to Amph-lip doses were not detected in any of ten long-term survivors over a median observation time of 36 months (range 30-44 months). Amph-lip appears to be a promising alternative antifungal treatment, especially for patients with impaired organ function, when high doses of amphotericin B are necessary.","['Emminger, W', 'Graninger, W', 'Emminger-Schmidmeier, W', 'Zoubek, A', 'Pillwein, K', 'Susani, M', 'Wasserer, A', 'Gadner, H']","['Emminger W', 'Graninger W', 'Emminger-Schmidmeier W', 'Zoubek A', 'Pillwein K', 'Susani M', 'Wasserer A', 'Gadner H']","[""St. Anna Children's Hospital, Vienna, Austria.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Agranulocytosis/*drug therapy', 'Amphotericin B/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug Carriers', 'Hematologic Diseases/therapy', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Liposomes', 'Lymphoma/therapy', 'Mycoses/drug therapy/*prevention & control', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF01695916 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 1994 Jan;68(1):27-31. doi: 10.1007/BF01695916.,"['0 (Drug Carriers)', '0 (Liposomes)', '7XU7A7DROE (Amphotericin B)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We recently demonstrated that this GVL effect, observed with the EL4 leukemia/lymphoma in the A/J-->B10 strain combination, was mediated by CD8+ A/J T-cells in a CD4-independent fashion. IL-2 inhibited only the activity of CD4+ cells, and not that of CD4-independent CD8+ T-cells in A/J spleen cell inocula. This inhibition of CD4 function was sufficient to markedly inhibit GVHD, thus explaining the dissociation of GVHD and GVL in IL-2-treated mice. We have now performed studies to determine the capacity of IL-2 to inhibit GVHD induced across a variety of different histocompatibility barriers. IL-2 significantly delayed GVHD mortality in three of four additional fully major histocompatibility complex (MHC) plus minor-disparate strain combinations when CD4+ T-cells were given. Numbers of CD8+ T-cells comparable to those that might contaminate human marrow demonstrated a relatively poor capacity to produce acute GVHD when given without CD4+ cells in all of three additional strain combinations evaluated. In one of these strain combinations (B10-->BALB/c), IL-2 protected against acute but not chronic GVHD mortality when CD4+ cells were given with or without CD8+ cells. In one fully allogenic strain combination, B10-->A/J, IL-2 did not inhibit the GVHD produced by CD4+ cells given with or without CD8+ cells. IL-2 was unable to inhibit CD8-mediated GVHD in strain combinations differing at isolated class I MHC loci. In a strain combination differing only at multiple minor histocompatibility antigen (HA) loci, B10-->C3H.SW, GVHD was largely CD8-dependent, but IL-2 did not inhibit the small CD4-mediated component of GVHD. Together, these results suggest that IL-2 inhibits a restricted subset of CD4 cells or functions, and that the type of CD4 activities mediating GVHD is determined by the particular histoincompatibilities between donor and host.","['Sykes, M', 'Harty, M W', 'Pearson, D A']","['Sykes M', 'Harty MW', 'Pearson DA']","['Transplantation Research Biology Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston 02129-2060.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunother Emphasis Tumor Immunol,Journal of immunotherapy with emphasis on tumor immunology : official journal of the Society for Biological Therapy,9418950,IM,"['Animals', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/immunology/*prevention & control', 'Interleukin-2/*immunology/pharmacology', 'Major Histocompatibility Complex/immunology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Species Specificity', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/*immunology']",1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00002371-199401000-00002 [doi]'],ppublish,J Immunother Emphasis Tumor Immunol. 1994 Jan;15(1):11-21. doi: 10.1097/00002371-199401000-00002.,['0 (Interleukin-2)'],,,,['NCI RO1CA55290/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In mice, the timing of cytokine administration is critical in achieving synergy. Because hTNF exhibits negligible binding to the type II murine TNF receptor (TNF-R), we questioned whether murine TNF (mTNF) would have therapeutic benefits, scheduling requirements, and toxic effects similar to those of the hIL-2-hTNF combination. To evaluate the biological effects of TNF-R types I and II interaction, we directly compared the effects of mTNF and hTNF in combination with hIL-2 on in vivo tumor regression and in vitro activation of murine splenocytes. Our results demonstrate for the first time that (a) the cytokine combination hTNF-hIL-2 is consistently more efficacious than mTNF-hIL-2 in in vivo murine immunotherapy models; (b) the in vivo antitumor effects of hTNF-hIL-2 and not mTNF-hIL-2 are critically dependent upon cytokine scheduling; and (c) in vitro culture of splenocytes with mTNF-hIL-2 enhances cellular proliferation, Lyt 2, and TNF-RI expression compared with hTNF-hIL-2.

Overall, three patients were found to have Ph-related molecular abnormalities; one had p190 and two had p210 disease. All three patients had ALL and were among 16 patients with insufficient metaphases by cytogenetic analysis, yielding an incidence of 19% in the latter category. Based on a 32% incidence of insufficient metaphases in our adult ALL population, we project an additional detection rate of 6% Ph-positive ALL by molecular studies and an overall incidence of 20% (14% + 6%) Ph-positive or BCR-ABL-positive ALL. None of the remaining patients with ALL and none of the 24 patients with AML investigated had BCR-ABL-positive disease.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eight cases of parotid carcinoma were identified among survivors of primary childhood cancer treated at two centers. Medical records and imaging studies were reviewed to identify the frequency of second parotid tumors, to assess possible risk factors for their development, and to identify any specific MR or CT features of these tumors. RESULTS: Parotid tumors (mucoepidermoid carcinoma in seven cases and acinar cell carcinoma in one) were diagnosed a median of 9 years (range, 4-16 years) after diagnosis of the initial cancer. These tumors represented 6% of the second cancers diagnosed at one center, whereas salivary gland malignant neoplasms accounted for only 0.08% of primary cancers diagnosed during the same period. The patients ranged from 1 month to 14 years old at the time of initial diagnosis of acute leukemia (n = 7) or neuroblastoma (n = 1). All patients had received multiagent chemotherapy for their initial cancer, and six had received radiation to the head and/or neck. At diagnosis, the parotid tumors were painless, enlarging, periauricular masses without associated facial nerve palsy. Preoperative CT, performed in three cases, showed a solid enhancing parotid soft-tissue mass that was isodense with muscle. MR imaging in two cases showed inhomogeneously enhancing parotid masses. One was isointense with the contralateral parotid gland on T1- and T2-weighted images and hyperintense on contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images; the other was hypointense on T1-weighted images and showed inhomogeneous enhancement that was more intense than in the normal parotid gland. The borders were poorly defined in both these cases. CONCLUSION: Malignant parotid gland tumors are rare in the first two decades of life but may occur more often among patients who have previously received radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy. The CT and MR appearances of these lesions are variable.","['Kaste, S C', 'Hedlund, G', 'Pratt, C B']","['Kaste SC', 'Hedlund G', 'Pratt CB']","[""Department of Diagnostic Imaging, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38101-0318.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,AJR Am J Roentgenol,AJR.

Southern blot analysis of T cell beta chain gene rearrangements indicates that all cell lines are composed of clonal populations. The same type of analysis performed with HTLV-I-specific probes showed that they harbor 1 to 5 copies of full length proviruses often associated with deleted proviruses with a restriction map for BamHI, HindIII, PstI and SacI restriction enzymes resembling those of HTLV-I previously isolated from Japan and Caribbean area. One of the cell lines, 2060, derived from a TSP patient was shown to express a relative large amount of virus easily transmissible to fresh peripheral and cord blood lymphocytes. The full length proviral genome contained in this cell line was cloned and used in transient expression experiments. We showed that the cloned provirus was able to direct the synthesis of the major structural viral proteins, the protease and the tax and rex regulatory proteins. The structural viral proteins could be assembled into free particles detected in the culture medium of transfected cells. Although the infectivity of these viral particles remains to be determined, this new clone can be employed to examine the cell types in which this TSP-derived provirus directs viral protein synthesis and eventually replicates.

The CAN protein has been proposed to be a putative oncogene product associated with myeloid leukemogenesis. Its subcellular localization was not established. To confirm that the putative rat nucleoporin is indeed a homolog of the human CAN protein and to determine its subcellular localization, we expressed a 39-kDa internal segment of the 213,790-Da human CAN protein in Escherichia coli and raised monospecific antibodies, which reacted with the putative rat nucleoporin. Immunofluorescence microscopy of HeLa cells gave a punctate nuclear surface staining pattern characteristic of nucleoporins, and immunoelectron microscopy yielded specific decoration of the cytoplasmic side of the nuclear pore complex. This suggests that the protein is part of the short fibers that emanate from the cytoplasmic aspect of the nuclear pore complex. In agreement with previously proposed nomenclature for nucleoporins, we propose the alternative term nup214 (nucleoporin of 214 kDa) for the CAN protein.","['Kraemer, D', 'Wozniak, R W', 'Blobel, G', 'Radu, A']","['Kraemer D', 'Wozniak RW', 'Blobel G', 'Radu A']","['Laboratory of Cell Biology, Rockefeller University, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, New York, NY 10021.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Western', '*Cell Compartmentation', '*Cell Polarity', 'HeLa Cells/ultrastructure', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/etiology', 'Microscopy, Immunoelectron', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nuclear Envelope/chemistry/*ultrastructure', '*Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/immunology/*isolation & purification', 'Oncogene Proteins/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Peptide Fragments/genetics/immunology', 'Rats', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid']",1994/02/15 00:00,1994/02/15 00:01,['1994/02/15 00:00'],"['1994/02/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/02/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/02/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.91.4.1519 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1994 Feb 15;91(4):1519-23. doi: 10.1073/pnas.91.4.1519.,"['0 (NUP214 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",,,,,,,,PMC43191,,,,,,,,,,

Although various protocols have been devised for in vivo delivery of retrovirus, comparison of hepatocyte transduction frequencies has been difficult due to variations in retroviral titer and a paucity of DNA data. We have previously reported an in vivo rat hepatocyte transduction technique which involves 70% hepatectomy followed 24 hr later by portal vein injection of retrovirus during hepatic in-flow occlusion. In this study, we employed this method and concentrated retroviral preparations to achieve transduction of up to 15% of hepatocytes as determined by a quantitative PCR assay. As an initial step toward identifying promoters which lead to high-level long-term expression of retroviral transduced genes, we used our in vivo delivery system to compare the Moloney murine leukemia virus long terminal repeat (LTR) promoter with the promoter for the large subunit of murine RNA polymerase II (Pol-II). Human alpha 1-antitrypsin (hAAT) was used as the reporter gene to facilitate long-term analysis of expression. Serum hAAT levels were higher for the Pol-II promoter (143 ng/ml) than for the LTR promoter (50 ng/ml). This difference was consistent with the higher transduction frequency observed for the Pol-II-hAAT vector. Although serum hAAT expression was sustained for up to 1 year in six of eight Pol-II-hAAT-transduced rats and three of five LTR-hAAT-transduced rats and was proportional to hAAT mRNA level and proviral DNA frequency, in vivo expression was significantly lower than in transduced tissue culture cells. We conclude that a high frequency of in vivo transduction can be achieved by using retroviral vectors and our rapid transduction protocol, but transduced gene expression remains a serious problem. The quantitative assays described herein will facilitate in vivo comparisons of gene regulatory elements.","['Rettinger, S D', 'Kennedy, S C', 'Wu, X', 'Saylors, R L', 'Hafenrichter, D G', 'Flye, M W', 'Ponder, K P']","['Rettinger SD', 'Kennedy SC', 'Wu X', 'Saylors RL', 'Hafenrichter DG', 'Flye MW', 'Ponder KP']","['Department of Surgery, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO 63110.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Evaluation Studies as Topic', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Genetic Therapy/*methods', 'Genetic Vectors/*genetics', 'Hepatectomy', '*Liver', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/*genetics', 'Proviruses/genetics', 'RNA Polymerase II/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Rats', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid/genetics', '*Transduction, Genetic', 'alpha 1-Antitrypsin/biosynthesis/genetics']",1994/02/15 00:00,1994/02/15 00:01,['1994/02/15 00:00'],"['1994/02/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/02/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/02/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.91.4.1460 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1994 Feb 15;91(4):1460-4. doi: 10.1073/pnas.91.4.1460.,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (alpha 1-Antitrypsin)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (RNA Polymerase II)']",,,,['R29 DK44593/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],,,,PMC43179,,,,,,,,,,

A variety of mechanisms have been proposed for the cis-activation of individual members of the beta-globin gene family by the LCR located 10-50 kilobases upstream. It is not known, however, whether a given LCR can activate all developmentally appropriate globin family members on its chromosome or whether, within a given chromosome, the LCR must be committed to activating only a single gene. We have devised an experiment to distinguish between these possibilities. This experiment takes advantage of the fact that if two genes in a cluster are transcriptionally active and their promoters, therefore, are in a conformation hypersensitive to nucleases, restriction enzymes that cleave the promoters will excise the intervening chromatin fragment. The Apa I sites on human fetal G gamma- and A gamma-globin gene promoters are accessible to cleavage in nuclei from the human erythroleukemia cell line K562, which expresses these genes, but not in HeLa cells. We find that Apa I digestion leads to excision in high yield of the fragment spanning these promoters, showing that a LCR element is capable of sharing its activating function among members of a gene cluster on a single chromosome.","['Bresnick, E H', 'Felsenfeld, G']","['Bresnick EH', 'Felsenfeld G']","['National Institutes of Health, National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Bethesda, MD 20892.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Cells, Cultured', 'Chromatin/drug effects/metabolism', 'Chromosomes, Human', 'DNA, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Deoxyribonucleases, Type II Site-Specific/pharmacology', '*Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Globins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/*genetics', 'Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid/*genetics']",1994/02/15 00:00,1994/02/15 00:01,['1994/02/15 00:00'],"['1994/02/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/02/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/02/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.91.4.1314 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1994 Feb 15;91(4):1314-7. doi: 10.1073/pnas.91.4.1314.,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', 'EC 3.1.21.4 (Deoxyribonucleases, Type II Site-Specific)', 'EC 3.1.21.4 (GGGCCC-specific type II deoxyribonucleases)']",,,,,,,,PMC43148,,,,,,,,,,

This review focuses on the biological and clinical activities of the cytokine. Originally discovered as an antiviral substance, the efficacy of IFN-alpha in malignant, viral, immunological, angiogenic, inflammatory, and fibrotic diseases suggests a spectrum of interrelated pathophysiologies. The principles learned from in vivo studies will be discussed, particularly hairy cell leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia, certain angiogenic diseases, and hepatitis. After the surprising discovery of activity in a rare B-cell neoplasm, IFN-alpha emerged as a prototypic tumor suppressor protein that represses the clinical tumorigenic phenotype in some malignancies capable of differentiation. Regulatory agencies throughout the world have approved IFN-alpha for treatment of 13 malignant and viral disorders. The principles established with this cytokine serve as a paradigm for future development of natural proteins for human disease.","['Gutterman, J U']",['Gutterman JU'],"['Department of Clinical Immunology and Biological Therapy, University of Texas, M.

To investigate the molecular basis of this translocation, a cosmid library was constructed from the tumour DNA and the rearranged IGH locus was isolated in a single cosmid. Fluorescence in situ hybridization confirmed that the cloned region contained sequences from chromosome 11q23 fused to chromosome 14q32. Sequence analysis identified the breakpoint as a fusion between a region from the switch segment of the C gamma 4 gene of the IGH locus and an unknown sequence on chromosome 11. The chromosome 11 sequence maps proximal to the CD3 gene cluster and is therefore distinct from both the HTRX1 gene (rearranged in acute leukaemias) and the RCK gene (rearranged in a cell line derived from a histiocytic B-cell lymphoma). This newly identified region contains a cluster of rare cutting restriction enzyme sites located within 200 bases of the breakpoint, suggestive of a CpG island. Although this t(11;14)(q23;q32) translocation and that in the RC-K8 cell line affect different regions on chromosome 11, the breakpoints on chromosome 14 were found to have occurred at equivalent positions of S gamma 2 and S gamma 4 segments.","['Meerabux, J M', 'Cotter, F E', 'Kearney, L', 'Nizetic, D', 'Dhut, S', 'Gibbons, B', 'Lister, T A', 'Young, B D']","['Meerabux JM', 'Cotter FE', 'Kearney L', 'Nizetic D', 'Dhut S', 'Gibbons B', 'Lister TA', 'Young BD']","[""Department of Medical Oncology, St Bartholomew's Hospital, London, UK.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Adult', 'Base Sequence', 'Chromosome Mapping', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*genetics', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', '*Transcription Factors', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1994/03/01 00:00,1994/03/01 00:01,['1994/03/01 00:00'],"['1994/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncogene. 1994 Mar;9(3):893-8.,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",,,,,,,['GENBANK/S69134'],,,,,,,,,,,

For this purpose, a novel bacterial expression system was developed in which proteins are expressed as fusions appended to glutathione-S-transferase via a thrombin cleavage site and either one or four protein kinase recognition sites embedded in a glycine-rich domain. Since the interaction domain can be purified away from the glutathione-S-transferase moiety and the radioactive label is located in a flexible N-terminal tag, protein folding should occur normally. Our studies with E47 proteins prepared in this system indicate that the ratio between E47 homodimers and E47/tal-1 heterodimers can dramatically shift upon subtle mutations in the loop region and the second helix of the E47 protein. This unexpected results suggests a novel mechanism to alter the equilibrium between different transactivating protein complexes of the b-HLH class.","['Hainzl, T', 'Boehm, T']","['Hainzl T', 'Boehm T']","['Department of Medicine I, University of Freiburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Bacteria/genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Helix-Loop-Helix Motifs', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Plasmids', 'Protein Binding', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'TCF Transcription Factors', 'Transcription Factor 7-Like 1 Protein', '*Transcription Factors']",1994/03/01 00:00,1994/03/01 00:01,['1994/03/01 00:00'],"['1994/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncogene. 1994 Mar;9(3):885-91.,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (TCF Transcription Factors)', '0 (TCF7L1 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factor 7-Like 1 Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '135471-20-4 (TAL1 protein, human)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",,,,,"['E2A', 'tal-1']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Tax protein of HTLV-I, a positive transcriptional activator of HTLV-I gene expression, is a viral oncogene that also increases transcription of cellular genes including GM-CSF, IL-2R alpha and IL-2. One of the cellular targets of the trans-activating effects of Tax is the NF-kappa B/Rel family of transcription factors, pleiotropic regulators of immunoregulatory, cytokine and viral gene expression. In this report, we demonstrate that NFKB2 (lyt-10) and c-Rel are overexpressed in HTLV-I infected and Tax-expressing cells and, together, account for the majority of the constitutive NF-kappa B binding activity in these cells before and after PMA stimulation. Most importantly, we show a Tax-dependent correlation between expression of NFKB2(p100) and processing to the DNA binding NFKB2(p52) form, induction of c-Rel, and trans-activation of NF-kappa B-mediated gene expression. Furthermore, the NFKB2 precursor is physically associated with c-Rel and with Tax in HTLV-I infected cells. We propose that NFKB2 synthesis and processing allows continuous nuclear expression of an otherwise cytoplasmic protein and, in conjunction with overexpression of c-Rel, NFKB2 alters the NF-kappa B signalling pathway and contributes to leukemic transformation of T cells by HTLV-I.","['Lanoix, J', 'Lacoste, J', 'Pepin, N', 'Rice, N', 'Hiscott, J']","['Lanoix J', 'Lacoste J', 'Pepin N', 'Rice N', 'Hiscott J']","['Terry Fox Molecular Oncology Group, Abe Stern Cancer Research Laboratory, Lady Davis Institute for Medical Research, Sir Mortimer B.

The maxillary second premolar exhibited regularly spaced incremental lines in the enamel and dentine. A gross hypoplasia was seen in the cervical part of the crown corresponding to the time of administration of 10 Gy total body irradiation.

In addition, there are data suggesting that alpha interferon demonstrates synergistic antitumor activity with alkylating agents in animal models for a number of tumors. Based on these data, Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) undertook a phase II pilot study of the combination of interferon rIFN alpha 2b (2 x 10(6) IU/m2 s.c. tiw) and cyclophosphamide (100 mg/m2 per day orally) with the ultimate purpose of examining this combination as long-term therapy of follicular lymphoma in comparison to oral cyclophosphamide alone. One hundred five advanced stage III or IV eligible patients with pathologically diagnosed International Working Formulation B or C histology were entered on CALGB 8553 to determine toxicity and response rates to the combination. Both previously chemotherapy-treated patients (32) and patients without prior chemotherapy (73) were entered on study. For patients without prior chemotherapy the overall response rate to the combination regimen was 86% with 58% of chemotherapy-treated patients achieving complete response. Chemotherapy-treated patients had a total response rate of 62% with only 25% complete responders. Complete responses in patients without prior chemotherapy were positively correlated with absence of B symptoms, and good performance status and negatively correlated with the histological subtype of follicular mixed small-cleaved and large cell histology (IWF C); only performance status was significantly correlated with response in patients who had previously had chemotherapy. Survival at 5 years is estimated to be 63% for those without chemotherapy and 39% for those previously treated with chemotherapy patients. The maximum toxicities experienced during therapy with the combination regimen of cyclophosphamide and interferon alpha were primarily related to myelosuppression. Sixty-seven percent of patients without prior chemotherapy and 65% of patients receiving prior chemotherapy experienced severe leukopenia while severe thrombocytopenia and anemia occurred in 6-31% of these patients. Non-myelosuppressive toxicities were less frequently seen. These response rates are similar to those achieved in a previous CALGB trial with oral cyclophosphamide as a single agent, although severe myelotoxicity was increased to approximately 60% of patients from less than 10% with the single-agent therapy. The combination of alpha interferon and cyclophosphamide administered in this fashion is safe when peripheral counts are carefully monitored.

Exposure to EMF has been linked to leukemia and brain tumors in some but not all epidemiological studies. The effects of separate and combined alternating electric and magnetic fields on interleukin 1 (IL-1) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) production were measured in this study. Helmholtz coils and parallel plate electrodes were used to create uniform field characteristics (300 V/in., 0.3 mT). Effects were studied at a combined field frequency of 60 Hz. This frequency did not elevate culture temperatures above ambient room temperature. Murine thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal exudate cells (PEC) were exposed to an electric field (E), magnetic field (M), combined electric and magnetic field (EM), or no field (control). Three samples of PEC from each mouse were cultured with lipopolysaccharide in each field. Using commercial ELISA kits, supernatants of cell cultures were tested in duplicate after 24 hours of exposure for IL-1 alpha levels and after 48 hours of exposure for IL-6 levels. Results were evaluated using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). As a group, IL-1 production by the PEC from five mice and IL-6 production by the PEC from nine mice were unaffected by electric, magnetic, or combined electric and magnetic fields. Results from these experiments indicate that the 24-hour exposure to 60 Hz electric, magnetic, or combined electromagnetic fields had no effect on IL-1 production. Forty-eight hours of exposure to the same fields did not affect IL-6 production.","['Morandi, M A', 'Del Rio, J A', 'Caren, R P', 'Caren, L D']","['Morandi MA', 'Del Rio JA', 'Caren RP', 'Caren LD']","['Department of Biology, California State University, Northridge 91330.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Life Sci,Life sciences,0375521,IM,"['Analysis of Variance', 'Animals', 'Ascitic Fluid/cytology', 'Cells, Cultured/radiation effects', 'Electromagnetic Fields/*adverse effects', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'Interleukin-1/*biosynthesis', 'Interleukin-6/*biosynthesis', 'Macrophages/*radiation effects', 'Mice']",1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0024-3205(94)90162-7 [pii]', '10.1016/0024-3205(94)90162-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Life Sci. 1994;54(11):731-8. doi: 10.1016/0024-3205(94)90162-7.,"['0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-6)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to gain new insight into pathogenetic mechanisms of BLV-induced tumorigenesis by determining the karyotypes of BLV-associated lymphomas in cattle. Metaphases in cells from lymphoid tumors from 20 mature dairy cows were banded and analyzed after short-term, unstimulated culture. Nineteen out of twenty cases exhibited clonal abnormalities, 17 cases were hyperdiploid, and 16 cases had extremely complex chromosomal changes. Recurrent chromosomal anomalies were identified and there was clear evidence for the evolution of increasing chromosomal instability in 12 cases. The most common abnormalities were the acquisition of additional small chromosomes (23-29); trisomy of chromosomes 5 and 7, and Robertsonian translocations and isochromosome rearrangements involving chromosomes 10, 12, 23, and 26. Monosomy X, trisomy X, and translocations involving the X chromosome were also detected. Chromosomes 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 11, 13, 14, 19, and 21 were infrequently involved in either structural or numerical changes. Structural rearrangements of chromosomes 10, 12, 23, and 26 may reflect primary abnormalities occurring relatively early in transformation, whereas trisomy 5 may be an extremely common secondary abnormality. While comparison of these findings with the current bovine gene map raises intriguing possibilities for pathogenetic mechanisms, further studies are needed before hypothetical mechanisms linking chromosomal abnormalities with BLV-induced transformation can be made.","['Schnurr, M W', 'Carter, R F', 'Dube, I D', 'Valli, V E', 'Jacobs, R M']","['Schnurr MW', 'Carter RF', 'Dube ID', 'Valli VE', 'Jacobs RM']","['Department of Pathology, University of Guelph, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/microbiology/pathology', 'Cattle/genetics', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Cell Transformation, Viral/genetics', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Enzootic Bovine Leukosis/*genetics/microbiology', 'Female', 'Karyotyping/veterinary', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Trisomy']",1994/02/01 00:00,1994/02/01 00:01,['1994/02/01 00:00'],"['1994/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0145-2126(94)90124-4 [pii]', '10.1016/0145-2126(94)90124-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1994 Feb;18(2):91-9. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(94)90124-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the plasma ATIII activity was decreased in patients with DIC, no significant correlation was observed between plasma level of ATIII and that of thrombin-antithrombin III complex or prothrombin fragment 1+2. The extent of the decrease of ATIII in DIC was the most marked in cases associated with septicemia. The plasma level of ATIII in septicemia without DIC was significantly lower than that in DIC cases without septicemia, suggesting that the decrease of ATIII level could not be related to the pathophysiology of DIC, but to that of septicemia. The plasma half-life of ATIII in septicemia without DIC was significantly shortened in the absence of the increase of TAT level, suggesting that the extravasation of ATIII might be induced probably due to the endothelial damage in septicemia. The alpha 2-Plasmin inhibitor level was decreased in DIC patients. The decrease was the most marked (lower than 60% of normal) in patients with excessive fibrinolysis in which fibrinogen degradation was induced. The plasma level of alpha 2PI was significantly higher in the DIC cases with septicemia than in those without septicemia. The ATIII/alpha 2PI ratio was significantly lower in DIC cases with septicemia than in those with solid tumor or acute leukemia. Moreover, the ATIII/alpha 2PI ratio was significantly lower in MOF cases than in non-MOF cases in septicemia. The mortality of the MOF cases did not correlate with the ATIII/alpha 2PI ratio, but with the plasma level of PAI-1, suggesting that the decrease of ATIII/alpha 2PI ratio might not reflect the irreversible endothelial cell damage. Based on these observations, the calculation of ATIII/alpha 2PI in DIC patients would provide the following information; (1) a low ATIII/alpha 2PI ratio (less than 0.6) was frequently observed in septicemia, which could be related to the occurrence of organ dysfunction; (2) a high ATIII/alpha 2PI ratio (higher than 1.0) with the marked decrease of alpha 2PI level (lower than 60% of normal) suggests the occurrence of excessive fibrinolysis in which anti-fibrinolytic therapy should be considered when clinical bleeding was present; (3) The ATIII/alpha 2PI ratio near 1.0 was observed in DIC associated with the pathological conditions other than described above, such as solid tumors, in which the coagulation and fibrinolysis was almost equally activated.","['Okajima, K']",['Okajima K'],"['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Kumamoto University Medical School.']",['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Rinsho Byori,Rinsho byori.

After the virus particle is released from the cell, the C-terminal 16 residues are removed from the cytoplasmic domain of pre15E by the viral protease, yielding the mature p15ETM and p2E. We have investigated the function of this cleavage by generating a Moloney MuLV mutant, termed p2E-, in which the Env coding region terminates at the cleavage site. This mutant synthesizes only the truncated, mature form of TM rather than its extended precursor. When cells expressing this truncated Env protein are cocultivated with NIH 3T3 cells, they induce rapid cell-cell fusion. Thus, the truncated form, which is normally found in virions but not in virus-producing cells, is capable of causing membrane fusion. We conclude that the 16-residue p2E tail inhibits this activity of Env until the virus has left the cell. p2E- virions were found to be infectious, though with a lower specific infectivity than that of the wild type, showing that p2E does not play an essential role in the process of infection. Fusion was also observed with a chimeric p2E- virus in which gp70SU and nearly all of p15ETM are derived from amphotropic, rather than Moloney, MuLV. In a second mutant, an amino acid at the cleavage site was changed. The pre15E protein in this mutant is not cleaved. While the mutant Env complex is incorporated into virions, these particles have a very low specific infectivity. This result suggests that the cleavage event is essential for infectivity, in agreement with the idea that removal of p2E activates the membrane fusion capability of the Env complex.","['Rein, A', 'Mirro, J', 'Haynes, J G', 'Ernst, S M', 'Nagashima, K']","['Rein A', 'Mirro J', 'Haynes JG', 'Ernst SM', 'Nagashima K']","['Laboratory of Molecular Virology and Carcinogenesis, ABL-Basic Research Program, NCI-Frederick Cancer Research and Development Center, Maryland 21702.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cell Fusion', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cricetinae', 'Cytopathogenic Effect, Viral', '*Membrane Fusion', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Immunoelectron', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics/*metabolism/pathogenicity', 'Mutation', 'Protein Precursors/genetics/metabolism', '*Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Rats', 'Retroviridae Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/biosynthesis', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Viral Fusion Proteins/genetics/isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Viral Matrix Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Virulence']",1994/03/01 00:00,1994/03/01 00:01,['1994/03/01 00:00'],"['1994/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.68.3.1773-1781.1994 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1994 Mar;68(3):1773-81. doi: 10.1128/JVI.68.3.1773-1781.1994.,"['0 (Protein Precursors)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (Viral Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Viral Matrix Proteins)', '0 (murine leukemia virus protein p2E)', '0 (p15E protein, Murine leukemia virus)']",,,,"['N01-CO-74101/CO/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-CO-74102/CO/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,PMC236638,,,,,,,,,,

It is known that the gene for the receptor is expressed in primary hepatocytes and hepatoma cells but is absent in adult liver cells. Isolation of a 2.85-kb cDNA for the rat Ecor suggested that the rat viral receptor is 97% homologous to the mouse viral receptor and that it contains the envelope-binding domain that determines the host range of ecotropic murine retroviruses. This explains the efficient infection of rat cells by ecotropic retroviruses. Since cell division is required for liver cells to be infected, we determined the susceptibility of the regenerating rat liver to infection at different time points after partial hepatectomy (0 to 24 h) in relation to the presence of receptor mRNA. Infection of the liver occurred only when the liver was exposed to virus 4 h after partial hepatectomy. This time course of infection paralleled expression of the gene for the Ecor, which was rapidly induced between 2 and 6 h during liver regeneration. However, expression of the dormant receptor gene in quiescent liver cells can be induced by insulin, dexamethasone, and arginine, indicating that cell division is not required for expression of the receptor gene in liver cells. A diet high in carbohydrate (low in protein) significantly increased the concentration of receptor mRNA in liver cells, indicating that hormones play a role in the regulation of expression of this gene in vivo. We conclude that the gene for the viral receptor is expressed in the regenerating and quiescent liver when the urea cycle enzymes are down regulated. The infection of the regenerating rat liver by ecotropic retroviruses at the time point of expression of the receptor gene supports the requirement of expression of this transporter for infection.","['Wu, J Y', 'Robinson, D', 'Kung, H J', 'Hatzoglou, M']","['Wu JY', 'Robinson D', 'Kung HJ', 'Hatzoglou M']","['Department of Nutrition, Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, Cleveland, Ohio 44106.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Arginine/pharmacology', 'Base Sequence', 'Carrier Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects', 'Hormones/*pharmacology', 'Insulin/pharmacology', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/growth & development', 'Leukemia, Experimental/metabolism', 'Liver/cytology/*metabolism', 'Liver Regeneration', '*Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Membrane Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Receptors, Virus/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Retroviridae Infections/metabolism', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Virus Infections/metabolism', 'beta-Galactosidase/genetics']",1994/03/01 00:00,1994/03/01 00:01,['1994/03/01 00:00'],"['1994/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.68.3.1615-1623.1994 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1994 Mar;68(3):1615-23. doi: 10.1128/JVI.68.3.1615-1623.1994.,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Hormones)', '0 (Insulin)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (ecotropic murine leukemia virus receptor)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '94ZLA3W45F (Arginine)', 'EC 3.2.1.23 (beta-Galactosidase)']",,,,,,,,PMC236619,,,,,,,,,,

FIV IN has a relaxed viral DNA substrate requirement: it cleaves and integrates FIV DNA termini, human immunodeficiency virus DNA ends, and Moloney murine leukemia virus DNA ends with high efficiencies. In the cleavage reaction, IN exposes a specific phosphodiester bond near the viral DNA end to nucleophilic attack.

This translocation results in the fusion of the bcl-2 oncogene on chromosome 18 with immunoglobulin heavy chain genes on chromosome 14, and in the expression of higher amounts of normal bcl-2 protein. We studied bcl-2 expression in biopsies of 108 patients with benign and malignant cutaneous lymphoproliferative diseases (B-cell lymphoma, primary cutaneous, 42; secondary cutaneous, 21; primary cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, 21; B-cell pseudolymphoma, 24), using a monoclonal anti-bcl-2 antibody on paraffin-embedded tissue sections, bcl-2 protein was detected immunohistochemically in 16 of 63 cases of cutaneous B-cell lymphoma, whereas cutaneous T-cell lymphomas and B-cell pseudolymphomas were negative.

All other cases of B-cell lymphoma, including seven cases where bcl-2 protein was detected by immunohistology, and B-cell pseudolymphoma were negative. These results demonstrate: 1) bcl-2 protein is expressed in a small portion of cutaneous B-cell lymphomas; 2) bcl-2 protein expression is significantly more frequent in secondary than in primary cutaneous B-cell lymphoma; 3) only approximately one-third of cases expressing the bcl-2 protein are characterized also by the t(14;18). bcl-2 protein expression might indicate that the cutaneous manifestation of the lymphoma represents a secondary spread from a node-based lymphoma.","['Cerroni, L', 'Volkenandt, M', 'Rieger, E', 'Soyer, H P', 'Kerl, H']","['Cerroni L', 'Volkenandt M', 'Rieger E', 'Soyer HP', 'Kerl H']","['Department of Dermatology, University of Graz, Austria.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Invest Dermatol,The Journal of investigative dermatology,0426720,IM,"['Blotting, Southern', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 18', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*chemistry/*genetics', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*chemistry/*genetics', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell, Cutaneous/*chemistry/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*analysis/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'Skin Neoplasms/*chemistry/*genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic/*genetics']",1994/02/01 00:00,1994/02/01 00:01,['1994/02/01 00:00'],"['1994/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0022-202X(94)97763-1 [pii]', '10.1111/1523-1747.ep12371768 [doi]']",ppublish,J Invest Dermatol. 1994 Feb;102(2):231-5. doi: 10.1111/1523-1747.ep12371768.,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)']",,,,,['bcl-2'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

The rat with the primary uterine tumour also had mononuclear cell leukaemia (MCL), and MCL cells grew concurrently in implanted rats. At passage five, MCL cells were eliminated from transplants by implanting the central part of an SMT-Y nodule, consisting only of neoplastic smooth muscle cells. SMT-Y at passages six to 15 was examined biologically and morphologically. The primary tumour and SMT-Y tumours consisted mainly of interlacing fascicles of elongated and fusiform neoplastic smooth muscle cells with abundant cytoplasm. Occasional cells showed nuclear atypia. Mitosis counts per 10 high-power microscopic fields in the primary tumour and SMT-Y ranged from 11 to 36. Neoplastic cells reacted positively for desmin, muscle actin and myosin, but not for myoglobin. Electron microscopy revealed cytoplasmic myofilaments with oval dense bodies. These findings suggested a smooth muscle origin of SMT-Y and it was regarded as a leiomyosarcoma by the criteria for human uterine smooth muscle tumours.

The three genes exhibit varying degrees of transforming activity; the two viral genes transform NIH-3T3 cells in vitro, whereas the BCRABL gene is incapable of transforming these cells. To determine whether genetic alterations can enhance the transforming potential of the BCRABL gene, we employed genetic selection techniques which led to the isolation of a mutant form of the BCRABL gene with high levels of fibroblastic transforming activity. Molecular analysis of this clone shows that it suffered a deletion of 3' ABL sequences and their replacement with a cellular sequence of unknown origin, termed X.

Deletion of 3' ABL sequences analogous to that seen in the activated BCRABL protein without the addition of X yields 5 foci/100 ng of DNA. These results suggest that carboxyl-terminal truncations unmask the fibroblastic transforming activity of the BCRABL gene product and the addition of X sequences dramatically enhances this transforming potential, indicating a dominant contribution by the X reading frame.","['Shore, S K', 'La Cava, M', 'Yendapalli, S', 'Reddy, E P']","['Shore SK', 'La Cava M', 'Yendapalli S', 'Reddy EP']","['Fels Institute for Molecular Biology and Cancer Research, Temple University School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19140.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Abelson murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line, Transformed', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Genes, abl', 'Genomic Library', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Sarcoma Viruses, Feline/genetics', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Translocation, Genetic']",1994/02/18 00:00,1994/02/18 00:01,['1994/02/18 00:00'],"['1994/02/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/02/18 00:01 [medline]', '1994/02/18 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(17)37702-5 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1994 Feb 18;269(7):5413-9.,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,,,"['CA 47937-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-12227/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['ABL', 'BCRABL', 'c-abl']",,['GENBANK/L24160'],,,,,,,,,,,

In kinase assays of mAb AA4 immunoprecipitates there were phosphorylated proteins of 71-80, 53/56, and 41/42 kDa. All proteins were phosphorylated on tyrosine, whereas the 71-80- and 41/42-kDa proteins were also phosphorylated on serine residues. The precipitation of these proteins by mAb AA4 correlated with the presence of the alpha-galactosyl derivatives of GD1b. The 53/56-kDa proteins were identified as the Src-related tyrosine kinase p53/56lyn. The presence of p53/56lyn in the mAb AA4 immunoprecipitates was specific and was observed when several different detergents were used. The same 71-80-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were immunoprecipitated by mAb AA4 and anti-Lyn antibodies and may play a role in the interaction of p53/56lyn with the gangliosides. Although there is a weak association of the high affinity IgE receptor with these gangliosides, the coprecipitation of p53/56lyn with mAb AA4 was not secondary to the association of this kinase with receptor. These complexes of gangliosides and several proteins that include p53/56lyn, a serine kinase, and the high affinity IgE receptor could play an important role in receptor-mediated signal transduction.","['Minoguchi, K', 'Swaim, W D', 'Berenstein, E H', 'Siraganian, R P']","['Minoguchi K', 'Swaim WD', 'Berenstein EH', 'Siraganian RP']","['Laboratory of Immunology, National Institute of Dental Research, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Autoradiography', 'Cell Line', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Galactosides/analysis/*metabolism', 'Gangliosides/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Immunoblotting', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute', 'Mast Cells/enzymology', 'Molecular Weight', 'Phosphorus Radioisotopes', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Receptors, IgE/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', '*src-Family Kinases']",1994/02/18 00:00,1994/02/18 00:01,['1994/02/18 00:00'],"['1994/02/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/02/18 00:01 [medline]', '1994/02/18 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(17)37681-0 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1994 Feb 18;269(7):5249-54.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Galactosides)', '0 (Gangliosides)', '0 (Phosphorus Radioisotopes)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '19553-76-5 (ganglioside, GD1b)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (lyn protein-tyrosine kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this report, we demonstrate that overexpression of Id interferes with MEL cell differentiation and that inhibition of differentiation is accompanied by reduction in expression of three erythroid-specific genes. While down-regulation of Id is an early event in the differentiation process of MEL cells, E-box binding activity of these cells increases only at a later stage of differentiation, and this late increase is reduced by the overexpression of Id in the early stage.

Role of Ca2+ influx, synergism with platelet-activating factor and significance for chemotaxis.",4746-53,"Monocyte Chemotactic Protein-1 (MCP-1), a member of the Cys-Cys branch of the chemokine superfamily, induced a mepacrine- and manoalide-sensitive increase in the release of [3H]arachidonic acid from prelabeled human monocytes and monocytic THP-1 leukemic cells. The effect was rapid (<30 s), reached maximum at optimal chemotactic concentrations, and was completely blocked by pretreatment of monocytes with Bordetella pertussis toxin. A specific antiserum and heat inactivation blocked the induction of arachidonic release by MCP-1. No [3H]arachidonic acid release was observed in the absence of Ca2+ influx (5 mM EGTA or 5 mM Ni2+) or in monocytes loaded with a Ca(2+)-buffering agent. However, using ionophore-permeabilized monocytes and controlled intracellular Ca2+ concentration it was possible to dissociate MCP-1-induced Ca2+ influx from [3H]arachidonic acid release. Thus, the MCP-1-induced increase in [Ca2+]i is necessary but not sufficient for arachidonic acid accumulation. Phospholipase A2 inhibitors (mepacrine, p-bromophenacyl bromide, and manoalide) blocked monocyte polarization and chemotaxis induced by MCP-1. The related Cys-Cys chemokines RANTES and LD78/MIP1 alpha also induced a rapid release of [3H]arachidonic acid, and their chemotactic activity was blocked by phospholipase A2 inhibitors. Brief (5 min) pretreatment of monocytes with platelet-activating factor amplified MCP-1-induced arachidonic acid release and, at MCP-1 suboptimal concentrations, synergized in inducing monocyte migration. Since MCP-1 and platelet-activating factor are induced concomitantly by inflammatory cytokines in monocytes and endothelial cells, we speculate that the observed synergism may have in vivo relevance. The results presented here show that the Cys-Cys chemokines MCP-1, LD78/MIP1 alpha, and RANTES cause rapid release of arachidonic acid in monocytes and that this may be important in inducing monocyte chemotaxis.","['Locati, M', 'Zhou, D', 'Luini, W', 'Evangelista, V', 'Mantovani, A', 'Sozzani, S']","['Locati M', 'Zhou D', 'Luini W', 'Evangelista V', 'Mantovani A', 'Sozzani S']","['Istituto di Ricerche Farmacologiche Mario Negri, Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Arachidonic Acid/*metabolism', 'Calcimycin/pharmacology', 'Calcium/blood/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Chemokine CCL2', 'Chemotactic Factors/*pharmacology', 'Chemotaxis, Leukocyte/drug effects/*physiology', 'Cytokines/*pharmacology', 'Egtazic Acid/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Monocytes/drug effects/*physiology', 'N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine/pharmacology', 'Pertussis Toxin', 'Platelet Activating Factor/*pharmacology', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Virulence Factors, Bordetella/pharmacology']",1994/02/18 00:00,1994/02/18 00:01,['1994/02/18 00:00'],"['1994/02/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/02/18 00:01 [medline]', '1994/02/18 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(17)37607-X [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1994 Feb 18;269(7):4746-53.,"['0 (Chemokine CCL2)', '0 (Chemotactic Factors)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Platelet Activating Factor)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Virulence Factors, Bordetella)', ""139890-68-9 (1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid"", 'acetoxymethyl ester)', '27YG812J1I (Arachidonic Acid)', '37H9VM9WZL (Calcimycin)', '526U7A2651 (Egtazic Acid)', '59880-97-6 (N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.4.2.31 (Pertussis Toxin)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Integration into a discrete locus generates mutants expressing high levels of N-glycolylneuraminic acid.,3717-24,"Retroviral insertional mutagenesis can both generate somatic cell mutants and pinpoint the genomic locus associated with a mutant phenotype. In the present study, this approach was applied to Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO) made susceptible to Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMuLV) infection by stable expression of an ecotropic retrovirus receptor. These CHO cells were infected with a replication incompetent MoMuLV construct with a promoterless hygromycin phosphotransferase (hygro) gene inserted into the U3 region of the long terminal repeat and a second selectable marker, neomycin phosphotransferase (neo), expressed from an internal promoter. CHO clones containing integrated proviruses were selected with hygromycin or G418, and the subset of these with reduced cell surface Neu5Ac were then selected with wheat germ agglutinin (WGA). The majority of the resulting clones had a phenotype not previously described for WGA-resistant CHO mutants arising spontaneously or from chemical mutagenesis: Neu5Ac was almost completely replaced by Neu5Gc. We have provisionally termed these clones SAP mutants, for sialic acid phenotype. Southern analysis of HindIII digested DNA from four SAP mutants revealed that the MoMuLV provirus is present in a 10.4-kilobase (kb) fragment. Probing with a flanking CHO sequence resulted in equivalent hybridization to a 4.6-kb fragment and the 10.4-kb provirus-containing fragment in all four cases, while uninfected parental cells and non-SAP glycosylation mutants generated in the same retrovirus insertional mutagenesis experiments yielded only the 4.6-kb fragment. Sequencing of the 3'-flanking DNA revealed that each of the four SAP mutants had a unique provirus integration site falling within a 796 bp region of the CHO genome. The frequency with which SAP mutants arise suggests that this may be a preferred site for retrovirus integration.","['Hubbard, S C', 'Walls, L', 'Ruley, H E', 'Muchmore, E A']","['Hubbard SC', 'Walls L', 'Ruley HE', 'Muchmore EA']","['Center for Cancer Research, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge 02139.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Animals', 'Asparagine', 'Base Sequence', 'CHO Cells', 'Clone Cells', 'Cricetinae', 'DNA Primers', 'Glycoproteins/biosynthesis/isolation & purification', 'Glycosylation', 'Kanamycin Kinase', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Moloney murine leukemia virus', '*Mutagenesis, Insertional', 'Neuraminic Acids/*metabolism', 'Oligosaccharides/*biosynthesis/chemistry/isolation & purification', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor)/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Restriction Mapping', '*Transfection', 'Wheat Germ Agglutinins/toxicity']",1994/02/04 00:00,1994/02/04 00:01,['1994/02/04 00:00'],"['1994/02/04 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/02/04 00:01 [medline]', '1994/02/04 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(17)41919-3 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1994 Feb 4;269(5):3717-24.,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Neuraminic Acids)', '0 (Oligosaccharides)', '0 (Wheat Germ Agglutinins)', '1113-83-3 (N-glycolylneuraminic acid)', '7006-34-0 (Asparagine)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor))', 'EC 2.7.1.119 (hygromycin-B kinase)', 'EC 2.7.1.95 (Kanamycin Kinase)']",,,,"['R01 HG00684/HG/NHGRI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA40602/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R29-GM43165/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']","['hygro', 'neo']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Trials of high-dose chemotherapy have generally used autologous bone marrow transplant or peripheral blood stem cell support to ensure hematologic recovery after intensive chemotherapy and/or radiation. This report describes an approach in which high-dose carboplatin chemotherapy was followed initially by granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF; Escherichia coli. Sandoz-Schering, East Hanover and Kenilworth, NJ) and in subsequent patients, by both GM-CSF and repeated cycles of peripheral blood progenitor cell (PBPC) collection and administration. The addition of PBPC to this regimen led to significant reductions in the duration of neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, the requirement for erythrocyte and platelet transfusions, the length of hospital stay, and the use of intravenous antibiotics in this group relative to those patients who received GM-CSF alone. In addition, laboratory studies are presented that show a direct correlation between the number of progenitor cells reinfused and the duration of neutropenia and thrombocytopenia.

Inhibition of the efflux of VP-16 by novobiocin is responsible for the increase in VP-16 accumulation, which in turn leads to increased formation of VP-16-stabilized topoisomerase II-DNA covalent complexes and increased cytotoxicity. We now report that novobiocin synergistically enhanced the sensitivity of the multidrug resistant variants, WEHI-3B/NOVO and A549(VP)28, to VP-16, causing almost complete reversal of the resistance to the epipodophyllotoxin. These two tumor cell variants are resistant to several topoisomerase II-targeted drugs, particularly VP-16, but not to Vinca alkaloids; this finding corresponds to the fact that they do not overexpress the P-glycoprotein. The effects of novobiocin in these resistant sublines are mediated through the intracellular accumulation of VP-16, resulting in an increase in the formation of lethal VP-16-induced topoisomerase II-DNA covalent complexes. In the P-glycoprotein expressing multidrug resistant HCT116(VM)34 colon carcinoma and L1210/VMDRC0.06 leukemia cell lines, the latter being transfected with the human mdr-1 gene, novobiocin did not potentiate the cytotoxic activity of VP-16 nor increase the intracellular accumulation of VP-16 and the formation of covalent complexes, whereas their normal counterparts were sensitive to the potentiating activity of novobiocin when used in combination with VP-16. These results indicate that the action of novobiocin on the intracellular transport of VP-16 is not directed at the level of the P-glycoprotein, but that the action of novobiocin is antagonized by the presence of the P-glycoprotein. Since novobiocin is a clinically available antibiotic, has numerous structural analogues available for comparative studies, and has a relatively low toxicity profile, this drug, as well as structurally related agents, would appear to have significant clinical potential in combination with an epipodophyllotoxin for the treatment of non-P-glycoprotein expressing multidrug resistant tumors.","['Rappa, G', 'Lorico, A', 'Sartorelli, A C']","['Rappa G', 'Lorico A', 'Sartorelli AC']","['Department of Pharmacology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut 06510.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1', 'Adenocarcinoma/chemistry/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Carrier Proteins/analysis', 'Colonic Neoplasms/chemistry', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/analysis/*metabolism', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis/*metabolism', 'Drug Resistance', 'Etoposide/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Lung Neoplasms/chemistry/metabolism', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/analysis', 'Mice', 'Novobiocin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/11/15 00:00,1993/11/15 00:01,['1993/11/15 00:00'],"['1993/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1993 Nov 15;53(22):5487-93.,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '17EC19951N (Novobiocin)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)']",,,,['CA-02817/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The movement of proteins or lipids from the endoplasmic reticulum to the plasma membrane via the Golgi organelle and associated compartments exhibits several temperature-sensitive steps between 15 degrees C and 20 degrees C. In this same temperature range, ADR loses its cytotoxic capacity. Using the inhibitor brefeldin A (BFA), we have investigated the possible role of intravesicular trafficking in the loss of ADR activity and the induction of protection from cytotoxicity at low temperature in L1210 cells. We show here that cells pretreated at 37 degrees C for 2 h with BFA could be protected from a subsequent exposure to ADR. The concentration causing 50% inhibition, determined by cloning in soft agar, was increased approximately 3.5 fold. L1210 cells could also be protected from the topoisomerase II inhibitors etoposide and amsacrine, but to a lesser extent; the concentration causing 50% inhibition for the latter inhibitors were increased 2-fold. Spectrofluorometric analysis of intracellular ADR accumulation revealed that there was no significant difference in the level of ADR in cells with or without BFA pretreatment. In addition, examination of ADR-induced cleavable complex formation by alkaline elution showed no significant difference in the level of DNA strand breaks in cells which had been pretreated with BFA even though there was a large difference in survival. Further examination of the persistence of DNA damage after a period of up to 6 h of repair revealed that cells which were pretreated with BFA removed DNA strand breaks at rates equivalent to those of cells which had received ADR directly. These results suggest that the protective effect induced by brefeldin A does not involve uptake, DNA damage, or repair but instead implicates protein or lipid interactions which may be independent of DNA damage and which may influence critical events that take place after the topoisomerase II-DNA complex has been formed.","['Vichi, P J', 'Tritton, T R']","['Vichi PJ', 'Tritton TR']","['Vermont Cancer Center, Burlington.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Amsacrine/toxicity', 'Animals', 'Biological Transport', 'Brefeldin A', 'Cell Survival/*drug effects', 'Cyclopentanes/*pharmacology', '*DNA Damage', 'DNA Repair/drug effects', 'Doxorubicin/metabolism/*toxicity', 'Drug Synergism', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum/metabolism', 'Etoposide/toxicity', 'Golgi Apparatus/metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L1210/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Microtubules/drug effects/ultrastructure', 'Nocodazole/toxicity', 'Paclitaxel/toxicity', 'Temperature', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",1993/11/01 00:00,1993/11/01 00:01,['1993/11/01 00:00'],"['1993/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1993 Nov 1;53(21):5237-43.,"['0 (Cyclopentanes)', '00DPD30SOY (Amsacrine)', '20350-15-6 (Brefeldin A)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)', 'SH1WY3R615 (Nocodazole)']",,,,"['CA44729/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA56040/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since PCNA is a cofactor for Delta DNA polymerase, PCNA overexpression in CLL may also reflect the intrinsic DNA repair activity of the leukemic cells and thus their resistance to chemotherapy.

Although IL-12 shares some functional properties with interleukin-2 (IL-2), it appears to act via a distinct mechanism. In this report, we examined the effects of IL-12 on the cytolytic activity and proliferation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) obtained from patients with malignant disease. PBMC from two groups of patients were evaluated. The first group consisted of 12 individuals with metastatic solid tumors. PBMC from these patients demonstrated a marked defect in their ability to lyse natural killer (NK)-sensitive targets (K562) compared with normal volunteers. Overnight incubation with IL-12 (35 pmol/L) corrected this defect. The effect of 35 pmol/L of IL-12 on cytotoxicity was similar to that of 3 nmol/L of IL-2. In contrast, this concentration of IL-12 had little effect on cytolytic activity against an NK-resistant cell line (COLO 205). When IL-12 was added to PBMC obtained from cancer patients who were being treated with low-dose IL-2 in vivo, a dramatic increase in cytolytic activity against both NK-sensitive and -resistant tumor targets was observed. Unlike IL-2, IL-12 failed to stimulate proliferation of resting PBMC from cancer patients significantly. The second group of patients we studied comprised 13 patients who had recently undergone allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) for hematologic malignancy. In resting PBMC from these transplant recipients, IL-12 was capable of enhancing cytotoxicity against both NK-sensitive and -resistant tumor targets. Our findings indicate that IL-12 can restore defective NK activity of PBMC from patients with metastatic cancer, as well as enhance cytolytic function of PBMC from patients after allogeneic BMT. The clinical use of IL-12 as an immunomodulator in patients with malignancy merits further consideration.","['Soiffer, R J', 'Robertson, M J', 'Murray, C', 'Cochran, K', 'Ritz, J']","['Soiffer RJ', 'Robertson MJ', 'Murray C', 'Cochran K', 'Ritz J']","['Division of Tumor Immunology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02115.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/*drug effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-12', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'Interleukins/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia/immunology/surgery', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', 'Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Lymphoma/immunology/surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Neoplasms/*immunology', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1993/11/01 00:00,1993/11/01 00:01,['1993/11/01 00:00'],"['1993/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)81928-4 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1993 Nov 1;82(9):2790-6.,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Interleukins)', '187348-17-0 (Interleukin-12)']",,,,"['AI29530/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA41619/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore our results suggest that combination therapy with GM-CSF and tiazofurin may be beneficial for the treatment of refractory leukaemia patients.","['Fritzer, M', 'Gharehbaghi, K', 'Pillwein, K', 'Chiba, P', 'Goldenberg, H', 'Szekeres, T']","['Fritzer M', 'Gharehbaghi K', 'Pillwein K', 'Chiba P', 'Goldenberg H', 'Szekeres T']","['Institute of Medical Chemistry, University of Vienna Medical School, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Synergism', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology', 'Guanosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Humans', 'IMP Dehydrogenase/drug effects', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/enzymology/*pathology', 'Ribavirin/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/07/01 00:00,1993/07/01 00:01,['1993/07/01 00:00'],"['1993/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1993.tb03120.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1993 Jul;84(3):552-4. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1993.tb03120.x.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '49717AWG6K (Ribavirin)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '86-01-1 (Guanosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 1.1.1.205 (IMP Dehydrogenase)', 'ULJ82834RE (tiazofurin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The targeting of lymphoma associated antigens with MoAb appears to be more favorable than the targeting of antigens on epithelial tumor. Antigen abundance may not be the overriding factor in this favorable targeting, since the number of antigenic sites per cell are often in the same range or lower than those targeted in epithelial tumors. This improved targeting is likely related to the greater access of antibody to the target antigen in lymph nodes, bone marrow, circulation, and other sites. With certain antibodies, trafficking of the cells targeted with the radiolabeled antibody may also result in favorable localization [19]. While the most frequently used isotope for imaging and therapy has been 131I, certain limitations have been observed, including its high-energy gamma rays and resulting lower resolution, and the frequent occurrence of dehalogenation [21,25,98]. Many of the antigens expressed by lymphomas undergo antigenic modulation. Antigens that undergo modulation may be targeted successfully, but once modulation occurs the antibody is broken down and the iodine is rapidly excreted from the cells. While this rapid release from normal organs is an advantage, it is an undesirable event at the tumor site. In contrast to the case of 131I MoAb, modulation may be an advantage for targeting with 111In labeled antibodies, since the radioactive metals are retained for longer periods at the tumor sites; even if the antibody is broken down, the 111In is not easily excreted from the cells [52]. Among the most consistent and favorable targeting observed to date is that seen with 111In T101 in CTCL. These studies have shown concentration of 111In in tumor of 10-100 times that seen in other tumor systems using iodinated antibodies. Unfortunately no studies have followed this lead and performed the necessary comparisons between 111In and 131I MoAb to determine if this is a consistent finding. The use of 99mTc labeled MoAb for imaging lymphomas is in its infancy, although preliminary reports appear promising [71]. While in epithelial tumors preferential tumor targeting may take more than 48 hours in lymphomas, targeting is usually seen within the first 24 hours, which is within the window of imaging time for 99mTc. Therefore, further evaluation of 99mTc antibodies should be performed. Determination of the optimum dose of antibody for imaging has been attempted. Studies using various anti-lymphoma directed antibodies have shown widely varying biodistribution and variable dose-response curves.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Carrasquillo, J']",['Carrasquillo J'],"['Department of Health & Human Services, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Cancer Treat Res,Cancer treatment and research,8008541,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic/blood', '*Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Hodgkin Disease/diagnostic imaging', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*diagnostic imaging', 'Lymphoma/*diagnostic imaging', 'Radiation Dosage', '*Radioimmunodetection']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/978-1-4615-3076-3_4 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Treat Res. 1993;68:65-97. doi: 10.1007/978-1-4615-3076-3_4.,"['0 (Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)']",,124,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The isolated cell is defined as one that is exposed only to self-irradiation (from internalized or surface-bound radiolabeled antibody) and to irradiation from free antibody in the blood. It is isolated in the sense that the particulate (beta, electron, alpha) emissions from its nearest neighboring antigen-positive cell do not contribute to its absorbed dose. Disease in the bone marrow and other tissues, since it is confined to a smaller volume, is more easily eradicated because the absorbed dose to a given cell nucleus is enhanced by emissions from adjacent cells (a smaller fraction of the emission energy is 'wasted'). The optimization simulations presented above for the M195 antibody suggest that the optimum dose of antibody that should be administered is that required to yield a concentration within the distribution volume of the antibody that is approximately equal to the concentration of antigen sites as determined by the tumor burden. Although not specifically considered in the modeling example presented above, antibody internalization and catabolism may be expected to play an important role in radioimmunotherapy treatment planning of leukemia. Depending upon the kinetics of internalization and catabolism, the absorbed dose to the red marrow and to antigen-positive cells may be reduced considerably, since catabolism, assuming that it is followed by rapid extrusion of the radioactive label, would decrease the cells' exposure time considerably. The recently demonstrated effectiveness of radioimmunotherapy in certain cases of B-cell lymphoma and in reducing tumor burden in acute myelogenous leukemia suggests that radioimmunotherapy is beginning to fulfill the promise held when it was initially conceived. The long delay in achieving reproducible success has, in large part, been the result of the conceptual simplicity of using agents that specifically 'target' tumor cells and they may thus selectively deliver cytotoxic agents. Emboldened by this apparent simplicity, early trials of radioimmunotherapy failed to consider the many variables involved in its implementation. As has been recently demonstrated using mathematical models of antibody delivery to solid tumor, chief among these may have been the failure to select the appropriate tumor type. By significantly reducing the problems associated with antibody delivery, hematopoietic malignancies offer the optimum conditions for successful radioimmunotherapy. As evinced by the wide range of antibody and radioactivity doses administered in the B-cell lymphoma trials, the case-specific nature of radioimmunotherapy requires an understanding of the relationship between the various input parameters and patient response. The complexity and interrelationship of these parameters precludes an experimental trial-and-error approach to their optimization. A stepwise approach to radioimmunotherapy treatment planning is proposed in which a model of antibody kinetics is developed and validated.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Sgouros, G', 'Scheinberg, D A']","['Sgouros G', 'Scheinberg DA']","['Department of Medical Physics, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10021.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Cancer Treat Res,Cancer treatment and research,8008541,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*radiotherapy', 'Models, Biological', '*Radioimmunotherapy']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/978-1-4615-3076-3_3 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Treat Res. 1993;68:23-64. doi: 10.1007/978-1-4615-3076-3_3.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)']",,132,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The ability of HIV-1 to replicate in non-dividing cells is partly accounted for by the karyophilic properties of the viral preintegration complex which, after virus infection, is actively transported to the host cell nucleus.

Direct activation of purified malignant B cells with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) resulted in the differentiation of most CLL cells, but not of the other types of B-cell malignancies. This differentiation required the presence of interleukin 4 (IL-4). In contrast, with the use of anti-CD2-stimulated normal T cells and IL-2, immunoglobulin M (IgM) could be detected in the supernatant of all but one of the purified malignant B-cell populations. However, by analysis of the light chains of the IgM produced, monoclonality could be demonstrated in only 13/21 cases: 8/11 CLL, 3/3 PLL, 0/3 HCL, and 2/4 NHL. In two patients additional proof that the malignant B cells were the source of the IgM production could be obtained in an idiotype-specific ELISA. Apart from IgM, also the production of IgG antibodies could be detected. However, only for 2/3 HCL patients, we could confirm a monoclonal IgG production. Since HCL is a malignancy of mature B cells, already carrying IgG on the membrane, this IgG production is not the result of a switch process. In all other cases where IgG production was polyclonal, we have no indications for the induction of Ig switch. The fact that the more mature B-cell malignancies were T-cell-dependent for their differentiation might be a reflection of the in-vivo situation. The efficient induction of malignant B-cell differentiation described in this paper allows investigation of the antigen specificity of these antibodies.","['van Kooten, C', 'Rensink, I', 'Aarden, L', 'van Oers, R']","['van Kooten C', 'Rensink I', 'Aarden L', 'van Oers R']","['Central Laboratory of The Netherlands Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service, Amsterdam.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic/immunology', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/physiology', 'B-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/metabolism/*pathology', 'CD2 Antigens', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cytokines/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G/biosynthesis', 'Immunoglobulin M/biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/pathology', 'Leukemia, Prolymphocytic/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*pathology', 'Receptors, Immunologic/physiology', 'Stimulation, Chemical', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/*physiology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Helper-Inducer/drug effects/physiology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology']",1993/10/01 00:00,1993/10/01 00:01,['1993/10/01 00:00'],"['1993/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1993 Oct;7(10):1576-84.,"['0 (Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (CD2 Antigens)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, inconsistencies in data on frequency and clinical relevance of multidrug resistance in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) may reflect a need for improved techniques to detect this overexpression. PURPOSE: Our purpose was to measure P-glycoprotein activity in peripheral blood cells of B-CLL patients and to analyze possible clinical correlations (disease duration, prior treatment, Rai disease stage, lymphocyte counts, and disease progression). METHODS: P-glycoprotein activity was assayed in peripheral blood cells of 42 consecutive B-CLL patients (22 treated and 20 untreated). We used dual fluorescence in a flow cytometric assay that detects efflux of the fluorescent dye rhodamine 123, which is transported from the cell by the P-glyprotein pump. Leukemia cells were costained with monoclonal antibody Leu12/CD19, and rhodamine 123 efflux was measured. Expression of MDR1 and MDR3 (also known as PGY3) messenger RNA (mRNA) was quantitatively evaluated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in 26 cases. RESULTS: Marked rhodamine 123 efflux was observed in 34 (81%) of the 42 cases and was abolished in the presence of multidrug resistance inhibitors. Rhodamine 123 efflux was not associated with Rai stage, lymphocyte counts, duration of disease, or disease progression. Although rhodamine 123-negative cases were about equally distributed among untreated and previously treated patients, the percentage of cells with rhodamine 123 efflux was significantly lower for untreated patients than for those treated with chemotherapy regimens including at least one multidrug resistance-associated drug. MDR1 mRNA was detected in 25 of 26 cases and MDR3 mRNA in all 26. MDR1 mRNA expression was significantly correlated with rhodamine 123 efflux, whereas MDR3 mRNA expression was not significantly correlated; MDR1 and MDR3 mRNA expression was not significantly associated with Rai stage, prior treatment, or disease progresssion. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that P-glycoprotein overexpression in B-CLL is intrinsic rather than acquired and that P-glycoprotein activity is enhanced after exposure to multidrug resistance-associated drugs. This enhanced activity does not seem to be associated with more aggressive disease. Our results also indicate that an assay of P-glycoprotein function combined with PCR is suitable for clinical multidrug resistance screening. IMPLICATIONS: Additional studies are needed to determine whether functional activity of P-glycoprotein, measured by rhodamine 123 efflux, is directly related to clinical drug resistance.","['Ludescher, C', 'Hilbe, W', 'Eisterer, W', 'Preuss, E', 'Huber, C', 'Gotwald, M', 'Hofmann, J', 'Thaler, J']","['Ludescher C', 'Hilbe W', 'Eisterer W', 'Preuss E', 'Huber C', 'Gotwald M', 'Hofmann J', 'Thaler J']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Innsbruck, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Base Sequence', 'Carrier Proteins/*blood', 'Drug Resistance', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*blood/genetics', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*blood', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*blood', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Messenger/blood', 'RNA, Neoplasm/blood', 'Rhodamine 123', 'Rhodamines']",1993/11/03 00:00,1993/11/03 00:01,['1993/11/03 00:00'],"['1993/11/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/11/03 00:01 [medline]', '1993/11/03 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/jnci/85.21.1751 [doi]'],ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1993 Nov 3;85(21):1751-8. doi: 10.1093/jnci/85.21.1751.,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Rhodamines)', '1N3CZ14C5O (Rhodamine 123)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For clinical use, paclitaxel is currently formulated in a vehicle of 50% ethanol and 50% polyethoxylated surfactant Cremophor EL (Cremophor). We have previously shown that Cremophor will block the P-glycoprotein drug efflux pump responsible for the multidrug-resistant phenotype. Overexpression of P-glycoprotein is one mechanism of in vitro resistance to a number of currently used cytotoxic agents including paclitaxel. PURPOSE: Our aim was to develop a bioassay to measure plasma levels of Cremophor and to determine whether or not plasma levels of Cremophor achieved during paclitaxel therapy are sufficient to inhibit the activity of the P-glycoprotein.

The bioassay used flow cytometry to measure the increase in equilibrium intracellular daunorubicin levels in multidrug-resistant human T-cell leukemia cells (CEM/VLB100) in the presence of a series of concentrations of Cremophor. Levels of Cremophor were measured in plasma from 21 patients after a 3-hour infusion of 135 or 175 mg/m2 paclitaxel. Both dose levels were given following premedication with oral dexamethasone, intravenous promethazine hydrochloride, and intravenous cimetidine. The Cremophor bioassay involved incubation of CEM/VLB100 cells (5 x 10(5)) for 1 hour with 2 micrograms/mL daunorubicin in 0.5 mL HL-1 medium plus 0.5 mL plasma prior to flow cytometric analysis. Pretreatment plasma was used to derive a standard curve for the effect of Cremophor on equilibrium daunorubicin levels. All measurements were done in triplicate. RESULTS: In vitro experiments indicated that, for maximal inhibition of P-glycoprotein activity, concentrations of Cremophor of 0.1% (vol/vol) were required. At the end of a 3-hour infusion of paclitaxel, plasma levels of Cremophor in 19 of 21 patients were 0.1% or higher and 0.09% in the remaining two. Concentrations of 5-20 microM paclitaxel dissolved in ethanol without Cremophor did not inhibit P-glycoprotein in this assay. CONCLUSION: The concentrations of Cremophor measured in plasma drawn from patients after a 3-hour infusion of paclitaxel at 135 or 175 mg/m2 were found to be sufficient to inhibit P-glycoprotein activity in vitro. IMPLICATIONS: The efficacy of paclitaxel against some tumors may be aided by its administration in a vehicle solution containing Cremophor in quantities that reach concentrations in the plasma sufficient to reverse multidrug resistance of neoplastic cells.","['Webster, L', 'Linsenmeyer, M', 'Millward, M', 'Morton, C', 'Bishop, J', 'Woodcock, D']","['Webster L', 'Linsenmeyer M', 'Millward M', 'Morton C', 'Bishop J', 'Woodcock D']","['Peter MacCallum Cancer Institute, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Biological Assay', 'Carrier Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Drug Resistance', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Glycerol/*analogs & derivatives/blood/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Paclitaxel/*therapeutic use', 'Pharmaceutical Vehicles/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/10/20 00:00,1993/10/20 00:01,['1993/10/20 00:00'],"['1993/10/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/10/20 00:01 [medline]', '1993/10/20 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/jnci/85.20.1685 [doi]'],ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1993 Oct 20;85(20):1685-90. doi: 10.1093/jnci/85.20.1685.,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Pharmaceutical Vehicles)', '6D4M1DAL6O (cremophor EL)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)', 'PDC6A3C0OX (Glycerol)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The distribution of lymphocyte subsets in IL-2 cultures closely paralleled that seen in humans, including a decrease in CD4+ and increase in CD8+, CD38+, and CD25+ lymphocytes and an increase in density of CD2 molecules. We also describe three distinct subsets of monkey lymphocytes, CD16+,56-, CD16+,56+""dim"", and CD16-,56+""bright"", and show that the CD56+""bright"" subset is substantially increased (to as high as 79%) after IL-2 activation. Furthermore, as in humans, the cells with oncolytic activity were characterized as CD56+, CD16+/-, and CD8+. This strong homology with humans indicates that the rhesus monkey may be a valuable preclinical model for evaluation of therapeutically relevant biological response modifiers.","['Savary, C A', 'Lotzova, E', 'Jackson, H J', 'Jardine, J H', 'Ang, K K']","['Savary CA', 'Lotzova E', 'Jackson HJ', 'Jardine JH', 'Ang KK']","['Department of Surgical Oncology, University of Texas, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/analysis', 'Bone Marrow/immunology', 'CD2 Antigens', 'Cell Division', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Female', 'Hominidae/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/*pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Lymphokine-Activated/drug effects/*immunology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive', 'Lymphocyte Subsets/*immunology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell', 'Macaca mulatta/*immunology', 'Ovarian Neoplasms', 'Receptors, IgG/analysis', 'Receptors, Immunologic/analysis', 'Spleen/immunology', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/10/01 00:00,1993/10/01 00:01,['1993/10/01 00:00'],"['1993/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jlb.54.4.307 [doi]'],ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 1993 Oct;54(4):307-13. doi: 10.1002/jlb.54.4.307.,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (CD2 Antigens)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)']",,,,"['CA 16672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 55597/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 6294/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since both classes of agents are known to induce cell-cycle-dependent effects and to delay cell-cycle traverse in specific phases of the cycle, an evaluation of drug sequence dependence was incorporated into initial clinical studies of the drug combination. To complement clinical studies, sequence-dependent interactions were assessed in vitro using L1210 leukemia. Cytotoxicity resulting from the combination of taxol and cisplatin was significantly increased over that achieved with cisplatin alone only when cisplatin was administered after taxol. This sequence was significantly superior to both the reverse sequence and to simultaneous drug treatment. Results achieved with sequence iterations of vincristine and cisplatin were nearly identical. In addition, alkaline-elution studies, using the optimal sequence of cisplatin and either taxol or vincristine, demonstrated that these antimicrotubule agents do not increase the formation of cisplatin-induced DNA interstrand and DNA-protein crosslinking over that produced by cisplatin alone. Although the mechanisms for the sequence-dependent cytotoxic interactions between cisplatin and the antimicrotubule agents have not been determined, it is likely that antagonistic interactions occur with the suboptimal sequences, probably because of cell-cycle-dependent phenomena.","['Rowinsky, E K', 'Citardi, M J', 'Noe, D A', 'Donehower, R C']","['Rowinsky EK', 'Citardi MJ', 'Noe DA', 'Donehower RC']","['Division of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, Johns Hopkins Oncology Center, Baltimore, Maryland 21205.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol,Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology,7902060,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cisplatin/administration & dosage', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Paclitaxel/administration & dosage', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF01195344 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol. 1993;119(12):727-33. doi: 10.1007/BF01195344.,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this work, the induction of apoptosis in target cells by 'killer' lymphocytes at differing states of activation has been studied. Although the cytotoxicity of natural killer (NK) cells and recombinant human interleukin-2 (rhIL-2) or interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha)-activated effector cells, against NK-sensitive target cells, was high, their cytotoxic action appeared to be mediated via differing pathways. Effector cells activated short term (4 hr) with rhIL-2 and those mediating rhIL-2 lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) activity after long-term (4 day) activation were found to induce the formation of sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS)-insoluble apoptotic bodies in NK-sensitive target cells, as well as increasing the level of activity of the apoptosis related enzyme tissue transglutaminase, thus suggesting the induction of the apoptotic pathway as a means of effecting target cell death. Non-activated and short-term (4 hr) IFN-alpha-activated effector cells did not appear to utilize this pathway in the target cell as their means of cytotoxicity. Effector cells showing LAK activity were also cytotoxic towards NK-insensitive cells, and this cytotoxicity again appeared to be mediated via the apoptotic pathway.","['Knight, C R', 'Rees, R C', 'Platts, A', 'Johnson, T', 'Griffin, M']","['Knight CR', 'Rees RC', 'Platts A', 'Johnson T', 'Griffin M']","['Department of Life Sciences, Nottingham Trent University, U.K.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Immunology,Immunology,0374672,IM,"['Apoptosis/*immunology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Enzyme Induction', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/*immunology', 'Killer Cells, Lymphokine-Activated/*immunology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukemia/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Transglutaminases/biosynthesis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/08/01 00:00,1993/08/01 00:01,['1993/08/01 00:00'],"['1993/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Immunology. 1993 Aug;79(4):535-41.,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', 'EC 2.3.2.13 (Transglutaminases)']",,,,['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],,,,PMC1421908,,,,,,,,,,

We have now investigated the effect of enforced expression of Hox-2.4 alone. Bone marrow cells were infected with Hox-2.4 retrovirus and then either cultured in agar or transplanted into irradiated mice. In vitro, colonies derived from virus-infected cells readily yielded IL-3-dependent, non-tumorigenic cell lines of the myelomonocytic, megakaryocytic and mast cell lineages. Surprisingly, both the establishment and maintenance of these lines required very high concentrations of IL-3 and reduced levels promoted differentiation. Transplanted mice analysed after 3 months appeared normal but their spleen and bone marrow contained abundant provirus-bearing progenitor cells, from which IL-3-dependent long-term cell lines could readily be established in vitro. Four of 18 animals monitored for up to 12 months eventually developed clonal leukaemia, associated in three cases with IL-3 production. Thus ectopic expression of Hox-2.4 enhances self-renewal of immature myeloid progenitors and progression to a fully malignant state is favoured by somatic mutations conferring autocrine production of IL-3.","['Perkins, A C', 'Cory, S']","['Perkins AC', 'Cory S']","['Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/physiology', 'Fibroblasts/metabolism', '*Genes, Homeobox', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology', '*Homeodomain Proteins', 'Interleukin-3/genetics/physiology', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Mast Cells/cytology', 'Megakaryocytes/cytology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Monocytes/cytology', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics/physiology', 'Receptors, Interleukin-3/metabolism']",1993/10/01 00:00,1993/10/01 00:01,['1993/10/01 00:00'],"['1993/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,EMBO J. 1993 Oct;12(10):3835-46.,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Hoxb8 protein, mouse)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-3)']",,,,['CA-12421/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['Hox-2.4'],,,PMC413667,,,,,,,,,,

Knowledge of these genes is known most completely from Drosophila, where a simple initial pattern generated by maternal effect genes is gradually segmented by the sequential transient expression of three successive series of genes: the gap genes, the pair-rule genes, and the segment polarity genes. Superimposing their action on the preexisting segments, these homeotic genes cause unique and often very distinctive patterns of differentiation for different segments. In humans, about 40 homeotic genes have been identified and are grouped into four clusters on chromosomes 2, 7, 12, and 17, whose organization reflects their spatial and temporal expression. Several homeotic genes have been found expressed not only in embryonic tissues, but also in adult tissues, most notably in the hematopoietic lineage, and also in tumors, especially leukemia, teratocarcinoma, and neuroblastoma, wherein their expression pattern is modified in a complex manner by retinoic acid. The target genes of the transcription factors encoded by the homeotic genes are largely unknown, but recent reports indicate that they may regulate the expression of adhesion molecules on the membrane and the production of components of the extracellular matrix.

The channel forming agent alamethicin prevented net uptake of VBL and addition of alamethicin to the vesicles after the steady-state had been reached resulted in the rapid efflux of [3H]VBL. Very low concentrations of Triton X-100 (0.01 % v/v) also prevented net uptake of VBL, whilst addition of Triton X-100 and making the medium hypo-osmotic after the steady state had been reached caused the [3H]VBL to rapidly diffuse out of the vesicles.

Remission induction for all three groups consisted of vincristine (VCR), prednisolone (PRED) and L-asparaginase (L-Asp). One consolidation course with cyclophosphamide (CP) and cytarabine (AraC) was used for the SR and IR groups, and two courses were given to patients in the HR group. Central nervous system prophylaxis was randomized using either cranial irradiation 18 Gy + 5 intrathecal methotrexate (IT MTX) or triple IT with maintenance. Reinforcement cycles were employed periodically during maintenance therapy (basically 6-mercaptopurine+MTX) and varied among the three groups. Four-week oral PRED every 16 weeks was the sole reinforcement agent for SR. Two-week VCR+dexamethasone (DEX)+adriamycin CP cycles were used to reinforce IR and HR at different intervals. Five third-form cycles with VCR+DEX+AraC were used only for HR. Treatment was discontinued after three years in patients who achieved continuous complete remissions (CCR). Eight patients died during the induction phase and eight failed to achieve complete remission (CR). The CR rate for SR was 97%, for IR was 98% and for HR was 83.3%; the overall rate was 91.8%.

BM cells from 8 patients with various types of myeloid leukemias were injected directly into human bone grafts in the SCID-hu mouse. Cells from 7 patients grew in the human marrow without spreading to the mouse marrow. Cells from 6 of these patients were successfully transferred in vivo to secondary SCID-hu recipients. The surface phenotype and the cytologic features of the leukemia cells were conserved during passage in vivo. Thus, human myeloid leukemia cells could be reproducibly propagated in the human marrow environment in SCID-hu mice. The differentiation of promyelocytic leukemia cells in the SCID-hu mice was induced by all-trans retinoic acid, suggesting that the biologic features of the leukemia cells were maintained as well. Finally, evidence for a leukemic progenitor cell population in one case of acute myelogenous leukemia was provided with this system.

This chromosomal translocation or similar bcl-2 gene rearrangements involving the Ig light-chain genes have been reported to occur in some cases of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL). We analyzed the structure, methylation, and expression of the bcl-2 gene in 20 cases of B-CLL or closely related variants of this lymphoproliferative disorder, including at least 16 typical examples of CD5+ B-CLL. None of the 20 specimens had evidence of bcl-2 gene rearrangements, based on Southern blot analysis using three different bcl-2 probes. However, immunoblot analysis using antibodies specific for the Bcl-2 protein showed that 14 of 20 cases (70%) contained levels of p26-Bcl-2 that were equal to or greater than those found in a t(14;18)-bearing lymphoma cell line. Furthermore, in 19 of 20 cases (95%), the Bcl-2 protein was present at levels that were 1.7- to 25-fold higher than in normal peripheral blood lymphocytes. These differences in the relative levels of Bcl-2 protein among cases of B-CLL appeared to be functionally significant, in that a preliminary analysis of 3 representative cases showed that CLL cells with higher levels of Bcl-2 protein survived longer in culture and were delayed in their onset of DNA degradation relative to CLL cells with lower Bcl-2 protein levels. Evaluation of the methylation status of the bcl-2 gene using the isoschizomers Msp I and Hpa II, and a probe corresponding to the first major exon of the gene showed complete demethylation of both copies of the bcl-2 gene in a region corresponding to a 2.4-kb Msp I fragment in all 20 cases of B-CLL. In contrast, analysis of 6 of 6 B-cell lines that harbor a t(14;18) was consistent with hypomethylation of only one of the two bcl-2 alleles. Neither copy of the bcl-2 gene was demethylated in this region in 5 of 5 lymphoid cell lines that lack this translocation. However, hypomethylation of the bcl-2 gene did not necessarily correlate with the relative levels of Bcl-2 protein present in the B-CLL cells, suggesting that additional mechanisms for regulating bcl-2 expression are involved.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Hanada, M', 'Delia, D', 'Aiello, A', 'Stadtmauer, E', 'Reed, J C']","['Hanada M', 'Delia D', 'Aiello A', 'Stadtmauer E', 'Reed JC']","['Cancer Research Center, La Jolla Cancer Research Foundation, CA 92037.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Chromosome Mapping', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 18', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis/genetics/isolation & purification/*metabolism', '*Gene Expression', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Light Chains/genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Methylation', 'Nuclear Proteins/analysis', 'Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/analysis/*biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Restriction Mapping', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/09/15 00:00,1993/09/15 00:01,['1993/09/15 00:00'],"['1993/09/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/09/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/09/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)78358-8 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1993 Sep 15;82(6):1820-8.,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Light Chains)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",,,,,['bcl-2'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

We now report a survey of the expression patterns of 9 homeobox genes from the HOX C locus in a panel of 24 human and 7 murine leukemic cell lines. The most striking observation is the lymphoid-specific pattern of expression of HOX C4, located at the 3' end of the locus. A major transcript of 1.9 kilobases is observed in both T-cell and B-cell lines. HOX C4 expression is also detected in normal human marrow and peripheral blood lymphocytes, but not in mature granulocytes or monocytes. HOX C8 is also expressed in human lymphoid cells but is expressed in other blood cell types as well. However, the HOX C8 transcript pattern is lineage specific.

A transmembrane protein, known as P-glycoprotein (P-gp), is involved in this resistance pattern. P-gp is able to pump large, lipophilic molecules out of the cell. 'Naturally occurring' drugs such as the anthracyclines and the Vinca alkaloids meet these criteria. To study the future clinical implications of multidrug resistance, we have gathered data in the literature on the presence of P-gp in haematological malignancies. At diagnosis 14-62% of all patients showed P-gp expression. Of previously treated patients 29-62% was positive for P-gp. A slight tendency to find a higher frequency of P-gp positivity in these previously treated patients was observed (so-called 'acquired resistance'). Early mutation and selection by the cytotoxic drug could account for the higher levels in treated patients. Chemotherapy itself could induce the expression of the P-gp pump. With the use of in vitro work various pharmacological agents have been found that can antagonize P-gp's function. Using these agents in clinical trials, some refractory patients showed a response to chemotherapy. We conclude that P-gp is probably just one of many causes of drug resistance in patients with haematological malignancies. Clinical results in some studies look promising, but many problems have still to be solved before common use.","['Pasman, P C', 'Schouten, H C']","['Pasman PC', 'Schouten HC']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital, Maastricht, Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,Neth J Med,The Netherlands journal of medicine,0356133,IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Calcium Channel Blockers/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Calmodulin/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Carrier Proteins/drug effects/*genetics/physiology', 'Cyclosporins/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance/genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/drug effects/*genetics/physiology', 'Mutation', 'Tamoxifen/pharmacology/therapeutic use']",1993/06/01 00:00,1993/06/01 00:01,['1993/06/01 00:00'],"['1993/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Neth J Med. 1993 Jun;42(5-6):218-31.,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Calcium Channel Blockers)', '0 (Calmodulin)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cyclosporins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '094ZI81Y45 (Tamoxifen)']",['Neth J Med. 1993 Dec;43(5-6):239.

Using this method, we demonstrate that cholinergic differentiation factor/leukemia inhibitory factor (CDF/LIF) and ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) induce mRNAs for choline acetyltransferase, somatostatin, substance P, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, cholecystokinin, and enkephalin. The induction of cholecystokinin and enkephalin by CDF/LIF and CNTF had not been shown previously. These data illustrate that the assay can reproduce findings obtained with other methods, as well as provide the sensitivity necessary to produce new results. These results also extend the overlap of CDF/LIF and CNTF in controlling gene expression in cultured sympathetic neurons, supporting the idea that these cytokines may share receptor subunits and signal transduction pathways.","['Fann, M J', 'Patterson, P H']","['Fann MJ', 'Patterson PH']","['Division of Biology, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena 91125.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,J Neurochem,Journal of neurochemistry,2985190R,IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cholecystokinin/metabolism', 'Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor', 'Cytokines/*pharmacology', 'Enkephalins/metabolism', 'Gene Expression/*drug effects', 'Growth Inhibitors/pharmacology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/pharmacology', 'Molecular Probes/genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/pharmacology', 'Neurons/drug effects/metabolism/*physiology', 'Neurotransmitter Agents/metabolism', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Sympathetic Nervous System/cytology/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic']",1993/10/01 00:00,1993/10/01 00:01,['1993/10/01 00:00'],"['1993/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1471-4159.1993.tb13628.x [doi]'],ppublish,J Neurochem. 1993 Oct;61(4):1349-55. doi: 10.1111/j.1471-4159.1993.tb13628.x.,"['0 (Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Enkephalins)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Molecular Probes)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Neurotransmitter Agents)', '9011-97-6 (Cholecystokinin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Analysis of proviral integration sites in DNA prepared from hematopoietic tissues and purified cell populations of long-term reconstituted primary and secondary recipients demonstrated polyclonal engraftment by multipotential stem cells. High levels (100-1,500 U/ml) of IL-11 were detected in the plasma of the MSCV-IL-11 mice. Systemic effects of chronic IL-11 exposure included loss of body fat, thymus atrophy, some alterations in plasma protein levels, frequent inflammation of the eyelids, and often a hyperactive state. A sustained rise in peripheral platelet levels (approximately 1.5-fold) was seen throughout the observation period (4-17 wk). No changes were observed in the total number of circulating leukocytes in the majority of the transplanted animals (including 10 primary and 18 secondary recipients) despite a > 20-fold elevation in myeloid progenitor cell content in the spleen. The exceptions were members of one transplant pedigree which presented with myeloid leukemia during the secondary transplant phase. A clonal origin of the disease was determined, with significant expansion of the MSCV-IL-11-marked clone having occurred in the spleen of the primary host. Culturing of leukemic spleen cells from a quaternary recipient led to the establishment of a permanent cell line (denoted PGMD1). IL-11-producing PGMD1 myeloid leukemic cells are dependent on IL-3 for continuous growth in vitro and they differentiate into granulocytes and macrophages in response to granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor. The inability of autogenously produced IL-11 to support autonomous growth of PGMD1 cells argues against a mechanism of transformation involving a classical autocrine loop.","['Hawley, R G', 'Fong, A Z', 'Ngan, B Y', 'de Lanux, V M', 'Clark, S C', 'Hawley, T S']","['Hawley RG', 'Fong AZ', 'Ngan BY', 'de Lanux VM', 'Clark SC', 'Hawley TS']","['Division of Cancer Research, Sunnybrook Health Science Centre, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/microbiology', 'Bone Marrow/*metabolism/microbiology/pathology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Chimera', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/microbiology/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Hyperplasia', 'Interleukin-11/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Interleukin-6/physiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*etiology/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Platelet Count', 'Retroviridae/genetics']",1993/10/01 00:00,1993/10/01 00:01,['1993/10/01 00:00'],"['1993/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.178.4.1175 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1993 Oct 1;178(4):1175-88. doi: 10.1084/jem.178.4.1175.,"['0 (Interleukin-11)', '0 (Interleukin-6)']",,,,,,,,PMC2191207,,,,,,,,,,

When K562 cells grown at 37 degrees C were shifted to 42 degrees C for 2 h, an approximate 1.7-fold increase in the activity of gamma-GCS was observed. Treatment of K562 cells with erythropoietin (EP) for 12 h resulted in a decrease in the activity of gamma-GCS to 64% of the control. However, responsiveness of this enzyme activity in the cells treated with EP to heat shock was similar to that in untreated cells. Changes in the immunological activity of gamma-GCS were also observed in parallel with those in the enzymatic activity. On Northern blot analysis of total RNAs isolated from the cells with human cDNA for gamma-GCS, a substantial induction of mRNA level was found by heat shock and a reduction of EP. These changes were modest but correlated to the mRNA expression of a heat shock protein, HSP 70. Heat shock also had an effect of 1.8-fold stimulation on glutathione S-conjugate transport in K562 cells previously incubated with 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene. Treatment of the cells with EP resulted in a decrease in this transport by 62%. Similarly, the levels of glutathione S-conjugate-stimulated Mg(2+)-ATPase, which enzyme is thought to be involved in the transport of glutathione S-conjugate, were responsive to heat shock and EP. These results suggest that glutathione synthesis and transport process of glutathione metabolites are responsive to heat shock and play a role in the defense system against stresses. It is also suggested that the regulatory site of the expression of these enzymes by heat shock is independent of that by EP.","['Kondo, T', 'Yoshida, K', 'Urata, Y', 'Goto, S', 'Gasa, S', 'Taniguchi, N']","['Kondo T', 'Yoshida K', 'Urata Y', 'Goto S', 'Gasa S', 'Taniguchi N']","['Department of Pathological Biochemistry, Nagasaki University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Biological Transport, Active', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Ca(2+) Mg(2+)-ATPase/isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Chromatography, Affinity', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Erythrocytes/*metabolism', 'Glutamate-Cysteine Ligase/biosynthesis/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Glutathione/*analogs & derivatives/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Glutathione Transferase/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Heat-Shock Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Hot Temperature', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive', 'Liver/enzymology', 'Molecular Weight', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Reticulocytes/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/09/25 00:00,1993/09/25 00:01,['1993/09/25 00:00'],"['1993/09/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/09/25 00:01 [medline]', '1993/09/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(20)80737-6 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1993 Sep 25;268(27):20366-72.,"['0 (Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '26289-39-4 (S-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)glutathione)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Ca(2+) Mg(2+)-ATPase)', 'EC 6.3.2.2 (Glutamate-Cysteine Ligase)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The lack of TH expression at later stages appears to be due to modulation of this catecholaminergic potential. A previous study showed that the phenotype reappears, for example, when E16.5 and older sensory ganglia are dissociated in culture into single cells, suggesting that extracellular influences can modulate TH expression. Moreover, TH expression in dissociate cultures is cell-density dependent, as a four-fold increase in plating density led to a 30% decrease in the percentage of TH neurons. The present study demonstrates that inhibition of TH expression in high density cultures is mediated by ganglionic non-neuronal cells (NNC), as removal of NNC abolished density-dependent inhibition. Moreover, plating E16.5 trigeminal neurons at low density on top of NNC monolayers resulted in an 85% decrease in the percentage of TH neurons. Treatment of cultures with non-neuronal cell conditioned medium (NNC-CM) reproduced the effect of coculture with NNC, suggesting that diffusible factors from NNC were involved in the inhibition of TH. The inhibitory effect of NNC-CM was mimicked by treatment of dissociate cultures with ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). However, immunoprecipitation of NNC-CM with antibodies against LIF or CNTF showed that only anti-LIF antibodies were able partially to remove the TH inhibitory activity of NNC-CM. Therefore, LIF is one, but not the only, factor mediating NNC inhibition of TH expression in cultured sensory neurons. In summary, these data indicate that ganglionic NNC can regulate sensory transmitter phenotype in culture by inhibiting expression of specific molecular traits. The finding that LIF can partially account for the inhibitory effect of ganglionic NNC on TH expression suggests a novel role for this cytokine in regulating differentiation of catecholaminergic properties in sensory neurons.","['Fan, G', 'Katz, D M']","['Fan G', 'Katz DM']","['Department of Neurosciences, Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, Cleveland, OH 44106.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Development,"Development (Cambridge, England)",8701744,IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Catecholamines/*physiology', 'Cell Communication/physiology', 'Cell Division/physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor', 'Embryonic Induction/*physiology', 'Growth Inhibitors/*physiology', 'Immunohistochemistry', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*physiology', 'Nerve Growth Factors/physiology', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/physiology', 'Neurons, Afferent/enzymology/*physiology', 'Phenotype', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Tyrosine 3-Monooxygenase/*physiology']",1993/05/01 00:00,1993/05/01 00:01,['1993/05/01 00:00'],"['1993/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Development. 1993 May;118(1):83-93.,"['0 (Catecholamines)', '0 (Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Nerve Growth Factors)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', 'EC 1.14.16.2 (Tyrosine 3-Monooxygenase)']",,,,['HL-42131/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has been shown that MDR is often related to the expression of a membrane glycoprotein (P-170) which actively pumps many hydrophobic agents out of the cells. Previous electron microscopic investigations revealed morphological differences between P-388 resistant and P-388 sensible cell membranes, but the modulation of the membrane morphology seems to be related to the tumor-cell environment. In order to establish if morphological differences exist between sensitive and resistant cells, both sensitive and resistant strains from three different cell lines were studied by scanning electron microscopy: human leukaemia CEM and vinblastine resistant cells (CEM/VBL100), human breast cancer MCF-7 and mice leukaemia P-388 with the doxorubicin resistant strains (MCF-7/DX and P-388/DX, respectively). The surface of the membranes of the sensitive cells was regular, unlike the resistant ones which proved to be irregular, endowed with long villus-like processes or numerous folds and ruffles. The addition of albumin to the culture medium induced a shift from the resistant to the sensitive phenotype, thus suggesting that the P-388/DX morphology may be linked to the concentration of protein in the culture medium. Exposure to DX, verapamil (VRP) or monoclonal antibody against P-170 (mAb-57) did not modify the surface of the resistant strains, demonstrating that surface irregularities are probably not linked to P-glycoprotein function. Blasts from four P-170 positive leukaemic patients were also analyzed: an irregular shape was always found.","['Galimberti, S', 'Bianchi, F', 'Bernardini, N', 'Mattii, L', 'Dolfi, A', 'Lupetti, M', 'Petrini, M']","['Galimberti S', 'Bianchi F', 'Bernardini N', 'Mattii L', 'Dolfi A', 'Lupetti M', 'Petrini M']","['Scuola Superiore di Studi e di Perfezionamento, Pisa, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",France,Cell Mol Biol (Noisy-le-grand),"Cellular and molecular biology (Noisy-le-Grand, France)",9216789,IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1', 'Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Blast Crisis/pathology', 'Breast Neoplasms', 'Carrier Proteins/analysis/*biosynthesis', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/drug effects/*ultrastructure', 'DNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Doxorubicin/*toxicity', '*Drug Resistance', 'Female', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Leukemia P388', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/analysis/*biosynthesis', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Electron, Scanning', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Thymidine/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Verapamil/pharmacology', 'Vinblastine/*toxicity']",1993/07/01 00:00,1993/07/01 00:01,['1993/07/01 00:00'],"['1993/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cell Mol Biol (Noisy-le-grand). 1993 Jul;39(5):543-51.,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, it occasionally gives rise to aberrant results. In this study, the M27 beta probe was used for clonal analysis in Japanese women with clonal stem cell disorders and in those with normal hematopoiesis. Restriction digestion with PstI indicated heterozygosity for the DXS255 locus in 41 out of 50 individuals (82%). Further digestion with HpaII in heterozygous women led to four distinct band patterns: I, both fragments were partially digested; II, either one of the two fragments was completely digested; III, a three-band pattern; and IV, neither fragment was digested. Of 21 hematologically normal females, 17 (81%) and four (19%) had patterns I and III, respectively. In some subjects with pattern I, imbalanced HpaII digestion in the two alleles was seen. Fifteen (65%) of the 23 patients with clonal stem cell disorders had pattern II, while the remainder (35%) had pattern IV. The normal tissues of three acute myeloid leukemia patients with pattern IV all revealed pattern I. It is possible that the aberrant band patterns could be caused by incomplete HpaII digestion in inactive X-chromosomes. In this study, we propose a hypothesis whereby, in normal tissues, aberrant cells, the DXS255 locus of which is not digested with HpaII despite their inactive status, would be mixed with cells demonstrating the usual methylation pattern. In normal tissues, complex of proportion of aberrant cells and skewed Lyonization could produce a variety of band patterns. If a cell with the usual methylation pattern proliferated monoclonally, pattern II would be seen: whereas if an aberrant cell proliferated, pattern IV would be demonstrated.","['Jinnai, I', 'Yoshida, S', 'Toyoda, A', 'Murohashi, I', 'Bessho, M', 'Hirashima, K', 'Nagai, K', 'Tomonaga, M', 'Boyd, Y']","['Jinnai I', 'Yoshida S', 'Toyoda A', 'Murohashi I', 'Bessho M', 'Hirashima K', 'Nagai K', 'Tomonaga M', 'Boyd Y']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Saitama Medical School, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Blotting, Southern', 'DNA Probes', 'DNA Restriction Enzymes/*metabolism', 'Female', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Heterozygote', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics', 'Methylation', 'Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length', '*Transcriptional Activation', 'X Chromosome/*metabolism']",1993/09/01 00:00,1993/09/01 00:01,['1993/09/01 00:00'],"['1993/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1993 Sep;7(9):1432-6.,"['0 (DNA Probes)', 'EC 3.1.21.- (DNA Restriction Enzymes)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sixteen patients (84%) had persistent marrow involvement at time of inclusion. Results were compared to those obtained in a control group of similar age and disease status in whom collection had been performed after MIV chemotherapy alone. The number of mononuclear cells, granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming units (CFU-GM), CD34+ cells were higher in GM-CSF treated patients with a lower mean number of leukapheresis (3.5 versus 6.4). Among the 19 patients harvested after chemotherapy plus GM-CSF, more progenitor cells were obtained in the cyclophosphamide group than in the MIV group. In all these patients except one, the number of mononuclear cells was sufficient to realize a transplantation. Seventeen patients received intensification with BEAM regimen (8 patients) or cyclophosphamide plus etoposide and total body irradiation (9 patients).

The results show that a single i.v. injection of 2 x 10(7) irradiated P815 tumor cells resulted in the induction of a state of specific unresponsiveness to tumor-associated antigens, as revealed by the inability of the treated mice to achieve immunologically-mediated regression of an intradermal P815 tumor containing C. parvum, or to generate effector T cells capable of causing rejection of a P815 tumor in T-cell-deficient (T x B) test recipients. Failure to respond to tumor antigens was associated with the presence in spleen of CD4+ T cells capable, on passive transfer, of suppressing adoptive T-cell-mediated tumor regression in T x B recipients. However, the same CD4+ suppressor cells failed to inhibit the generation of tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) in vitro. On the contrary, spleen cells from mice made unresponsive by i.v. injection of tumor cells were primed to generate CTL in response to tumor antigens in vitro. Taken together, our results suggest that unresponsiveness induced by i.v. injection of tumor antigens is an active process mediated, at least in part, by CD4+ T suppressor cells, and that these cells coexist in the spleen with antigen-primed effector T cells with a capacity to generate tumor-specific CTL when released from suppression in vitro.","['Rakhmilevich, A L', 'North, R J', 'Dye, E S']","['Rakhmilevich AL', 'North RJ', 'Dye ES']","['Trudeau Institute, Inc., Saranac Lake, NY 12983.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,IM,"['Animals', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/immunology', 'Female', 'Immune Tolerance', 'Leukemia L5178/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Sarcoma, Experimental/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/radiation effects/transplantation']",1993/09/09 00:00,1993/09/09 00:01,['1993/09/09 00:00'],"['1993/09/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/09/09 00:01 [medline]', '1993/09/09 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.2910550226 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1993 Sep 9;55(2):338-43. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910550226.,,,,,"['CA-16642/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-27794/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

During the course of malignant transformation the cancer-related genes are altered by a variety of mechanisms including translocations, deletions, and point mutations which commonly result in the expression of aberrant proteins. Our laboratory has focused on determining the extent to which cancer-specific proteins expressed by aberrant cancer-related genes can function as tumor-specific antigens. The current paper reviews our studies with two prototype cancer-specific proteins, mutated p21ras protein and chimeric p210bcr-abl protein. Ras protooncogenes are activated by point mutation in approximately 20% of human malignancies. The mutations occur primarily at codons 12 or 61 and result in the expression of p21ras proteins with single substituted amino acids. Only a limited number of amino acid substitutions occur. Murine studies demonstrate that immunization with synthetic peptides corresponding to the mutated segment can elicit both class II restricted CD4+ helper/inducer T-cell responses and class I restricted CD8+ cytotoxic T-cell responses specific for mutated p21ras protein. In addition, the existence in vivo of tumors expressing mutated ras proteins can be detected by assaying for T-cell immunity to the mutated segment of ras protein. Preliminary human studies show that some patients with colon cancer have existent antibody responses to p21ras protein, implying the possible existence of autochthonous T-cell immunity to mutated ras proteins in those patients. In chronic myelogenous leukemia the human c-abl protooncogene from chromosome 9 is translocated to the specific breakpoint cluster (bcr) region on chromosome 22. The translocation results in the formation of a bcr-abl fusion gene that encodes at 210-kD chimeric protein. The joining region segment of chimeric bcr-abl protein is composed of a unique combination of c-abl and bcr amino acids and is expressed only by malignant cells. Studies demonstrate that immunization of mice with synthetic peptides corresponding to the joining region segment can elicit class II restricted CD4+ T-cell responses to p210bcr-abl proteins. Preliminary studies show that bcr-abl peptides can bind in the groove of both murine and human class I MHC molecules and can elicit bcr-abl peptide-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). Whether bcr-abl peptide-specific CTL can lyse cells expressing bcr-abl protein is a yet unknown. In summary, the results of the studies reviewed confirm that cancer-specific oncogenic proteins can serve as tumor-specific antigens.","['Cheever, M A', 'Chen, W', 'Disis, M L', 'Takahashi, M', 'Peace, D J']","['Cheever MA', 'Chen W', 'Disis ML', 'Takahashi M', 'Peace DJ']","['Division of Medical Oncology, University of Washington, Seattle 98195.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Ann N Y Acad Sci,Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,7506858,IM,"['Animals', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Colonic Neoplasms/immunology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*immunology', 'H-2 Antigens/immunology', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Cellular', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/immunology', 'Peptides/immunology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras)/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Helper-Inducer/immunology']",1993/08/12 00:00,1993/08/12 00:01,['1993/08/12 00:00'],"['1993/08/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/08/12 00:01 [medline]', '1993/08/12 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1749-6632.1993.tb44000.x [doi]'],ppublish,Ann N Y Acad Sci. 1993 Aug 12;690:101-12. doi: 10.1111/j.1749-6632.1993.tb44000.x.,"['0 (H-2 Antigens)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)', '0 (Peptides)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (HRAS protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras))']",,40,,"['R0I CA54561/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R0I CA57851/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA30558/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']","['H-ras', 'K-ras', 'N-ras', 'abl', 'bcr', 'bcr-abl']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

LFA-1 is the only integrin expressed on all leukocyte lineages and functions both as a key adhesion receptor in immune and inflammatory processes and as a signal-transducing molecule. To elucidate the molecular basis for the leukocyte-restricted expression of LFA-1, the promoter region of the CD11a gene has been isolated and functionally characterized. The 5' region of the CD11a gene exhibits a similar exon/intron organization as the CD11b, CD11c, and VLA-2 alpha genes but is different from that of the genes encoding VLA-4 alpha, VLA-5 alpha, and gpIIb. Several tightly clustered transcription initiation sites have been identified on the CD11a gene, with the major site resembling the ""initiator"" sequence. Transient expression of CD11a promoter-based reporter gene constructs in both LFA1+ and LFA1- cell lines demonstrated that the fragment spanning from -880 to +83 is involved in the tissue-specific expression of LFA-1. Functional analysis of different fragments within the -880/+83 fragment suggested the presence of negative regulatory elements between -880 and -226 and demonstrated that the proximal region of the CD11a gene promoter exhibits tissue-specific activity.","['Nueda, A', 'Lopez-Cabrera, M', 'Vara, A', 'Corbi, A L']","['Nueda A', 'Lopez-Cabrera M', 'Vara A', 'Corbi AL']","['Unidad de Biologia Molecular, Hospital de la Princesa, Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antigens, CD/*genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'CD11 Antigens', 'CD18 Antigens', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 16', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Genomic Library', 'Humans', 'Leukemia', 'Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Plasmids', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/09/15 00:00,1993/09/15 00:01,['1993/09/15 00:00'],"['1993/09/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/09/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/09/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(19)36514-7 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1993 Sep 15;268(26):19305-11.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD11 Antigens)', '0 (CD18 Antigens)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The peptide transmitter, neuropeptide Y (NPY), has been identified in approximately 60% of rat sympathetic superior cervical ganglion (SCG) neurons, virtually all of which are catecholaminergic. However, we find that environmental signals which affect noradrenergic traits in cultured rat SCG, regulate NPY expression differently. Relatively large increases in neuronal density only slightly alter catecholaminergic properties in sympathetic neurons. However, levels of NPY were highly dependent on cell density. In pure neuronal cultures, increasing cell numbers from 8000 to 12,000 neurons per culture resulted in a 10-fold decrease in NPY. Coculture of SCG neurons with ganglion nonneuronal cells further reduced NPY levels at all neuronal densities examined. Treatment with the neuropoetic cytokine, leukemia inhibitory factor, which increased the expression of cholinergic traits and decreased noradrenergic expression, decreased NPY by 50% in cocultures. Finally, neither glucocorticoids nor the cytokine interleukin-1 beta, which regulate other transmitter systems, altered NPY expression. These observations indicate that although noradrenergic traits and NPY are often coexpressed, they are regulated independently in SCG neurons.

It was found that different phenotypes of lymphoid cells at various stages of differentiation have different activity levels of dipeptidyl aminopeptidase IV (DAP IV), plasminogen activator (urokinase type) and cathepsins B + L. The highest proteinase activity values were found in the lysates of just those leukemic T-cells whose phenotypes corresponded to the initial stages of thymic differentiation or to activated T-cells. The 10 times lowered activity was found in the cell phenotypes of mature T-helpers and T-suppressors, and the activity of the both was at virtually the same level. In lymphoid cells of the B-lineage (from pre-B to mature B-lymphocytes) the proteinase activities did not differ essentially: they were 2 to 3 times lower than in the lymphoid progenitors. It was suggested that the regulated activity changes in some proteinases occur during differentiation along the T- or B-pathways. It is likely that the increases in DAP IV and cathepsins B + L activities are associated with the activation of mature lymphoid T- and B-cells. No direct correlation was found between the activity of either proteinase and the expression of any of the surface markers under study.","['Lokshina, L A', 'Bylinkina, V S', 'Samoilova, R S', 'Gureeva, T A', 'Golubeva, N V', 'Polianskaia, A M']","['Lokshina LA', 'Bylinkina VS', 'Samoilova RS', 'Gureeva TA', 'Golubeva NV', 'Polianskaia AM']",,['rus'],['Journal Article'],Russia (Federation),Biokhimiia,"Biokhimiia (Moscow, Russia)",0372667,IM,"['B-Lymphocytes', 'Cathepsin B/*metabolism', 'Cathepsin L', 'Cathepsins/*metabolism', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases', 'Dipeptidyl Peptidase 4', 'Dipeptidyl-Peptidases and Tripeptidyl-Peptidases/*metabolism', '*Endopeptidases', 'Humans', 'Hydrolysis', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*enzymology/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Phenotype', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Urokinase-Type Plasminogen Activator/*metabolism']",1993/07/01 00:00,1993/07/01 00:01,['1993/07/01 00:00'],"['1993/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Biokhimiia. 1993 Jul;58(7):1104-15.,"['EC 3.4.- (Cathepsins)', 'EC 3.4.- (Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.14.- (Dipeptidyl-Peptidases and Tripeptidyl-Peptidases)', 'EC 3.4.14.5 (Dipeptidyl Peptidase 4)', 'EC 3.4.21.73 (Urokinase-Type Plasminogen Activator)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.22.1 (Cathepsin B)', 'EC 3.4.22.15 (CTSL protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.15 (Cathepsin L)']",,,,,,"Proteoliticheskie fermenty v leikoznykh limfoidnykh kletkakh cheloveka.

Together, they contribute significantly to the cancer statistics in the Southeast Asian region. Neoplastic proliferation may be instigated by the presence and expression of viral oncogenes which may be integrated into the host genome and/or exist in episomal molecules. Critical viral genes may also interfere with host genes, resulting in the activation of cellular proto-oncogenes and/or the inactivation of anti-oncogenes and their products. The molecular pathogenesis of virally-induced cancers has led to major breakthroughs in the understanding of carcinogenesis at a molecular level. The occurrence of some of these viruses in a significant proportion of normal individuals suggests long latency periods necessitating multi-step co-operating events arising from multi-factorial agents such as host genetic susceptibility, immunological and hormonal status, as well as chemical and physical cocarcinogens in the environment. Successful intervention achieved with effective vaccines such as the hepatitis B vaccine and measures to severe the chain of viral transmission culminating in reduced incidence of the corresponding cancer will provide conclusive evidence for the virus-cancer relationship.","['Chow, V T']",['Chow VT'],"['Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Medicine, National University of Singapore.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Singapore,Ann Acad Med Singap,"Annals of the Academy of Medicine, Singapore",7503289,IM,"['Anus Neoplasms/microbiology', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/microbiology', 'Deltaretrovirus Infections/etiology', 'Female', 'Forecasting', 'Genital Neoplasms, Female/microbiology', 'Genital Neoplasms, Male/microbiology', 'Hepatitis, Viral, Human/complications', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human', 'Humans', 'Liver Neoplasms/microbiology', 'Male', 'Nasopharyngeal Neoplasms/microbiology', 'Neoplasms/epidemiology/*microbiology', 'Papillomaviridae', 'Risk Factors', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*complications/microbiology']",1993/03/01 00:00,1993/03/01 00:01,['1993/03/01 00:00'],"['1993/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Ann Acad Med Singap. 1993 Mar;22(2):163-9.,,,69,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast, RE-3 reacted with 25 (93%) of 27 HTLV-I-infected specimens, and only six (27%) of 22 HTLV-II-infected specimens, thus demonstrating predominant reactivity with HTLV-I compared with HTLV-II. Because of the high sensitivity of rEnv-93 reactivity in both HTLV-I and HTLV-II, the specificity of this env protein was evaluated in specimens with isolated gag reactivity (HTLVind). Of the 44 HTLVind specimens, four (9%) demonstrated reactivity to rEnv-93 in WB assay.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-four AML patients in first remission received busulfan (BU; 16 mg/kg) and cyclophosphamide (CY; 200 mg/kg) followed by ABSCT. PBSC were collected by continuous-flow leukaphereses after induction and consolidation courses. RESULTS: The median numbers of mononuclear cells (MNCs) and colony-forming unit granulocyte-macrophage (CFU-GM) administered were 6 x 10(8)/kg and 11 x 10(4)/kg, respectively. ABSCT induced engraftment in 22 patients and there were two graft failures. The median times to reach a polymorphonuclear (PMN) leukocyte count of 0.5 x 10(9)/L and a platelet count of 50 x 10(9)/L were 13 and 19 days, respectively. Fatal hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) was observed in two cases. Other toxicities were mild and uncommon. Twelve patients relapsed between 1 and 9 months posttreatment. Actuarial disease-free survival (DFS) and actuarial risk of relapse at 30 months were 35% (95% confidence interval [CI], 25% to 45%) and 60% (95% CI, 50% to 72%), respectively. CONCLUSION: These preliminary results show the fast hematopoietic recovery and the low infectious and hemorrhagic morbidity associated with the procedure and strongly suggest that ABSCT may be as effective as autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT) in AML. However, further strategies for reducing leukemic relapse must still be investigated.","['Sanz, M A', 'de la Rubia, J', 'Sanz, G F', 'Martin, G', 'Martinez, J', 'Jarque, I', 'Sempere, A', 'Gomis, F', 'Senent, L', 'Soler, M A']","['Sanz MA', 'de la Rubia J', 'Sanz GF', 'Martin G', 'Martinez J', 'Jarque I', 'Sempere A', 'Gomis F', 'Senent L', 'Soler MA', 'et al.']","['Department of Hematology, La Fe University Hospital, Valencia, Spain.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Actuarial Analysis', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Busulfan/administration & dosage', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cryopreservation', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/*surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",1993/09/01 00:00,1993/09/01 00:01,['1993/09/01 00:00'],"['1993/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1993.11.9.1661 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1993 Sep;11(9):1661-7. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1993.11.9.1661.,"['8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)']","['J Clin Oncol. 1994 May;12(5):1100-2.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with poor-risk acute myeloid leukemia (AML) received sequential treatment with cytarabine (3 g/m2/d intravenously [i.v.]) days 1 to 5, and daunorubicin (45 mg/m2/d) plus CsA as a 72-hour continuous infusion (CI) days 6 through 8 in a phase I/II trial. A loading dose of CsA administered over 1 to 2 hours preceded the CI. CsA dose escalations ranged from 1.4 to 6 mg/kg (load) and 1.5 to 20 mg/kg/d (CI). Whole-blood concentrations of CsA were monitored by immunoassay; plasma concentration of daunorubicin and daunorubicinol were determined by high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). Specimens were analyzed for P-glycoprotein expression, and results confirmed by a quantitative RNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for the mdr1 gene transcript. RESULTS: Forty-two patients are assessable for toxicity and response. P-glycoprotein was detected in 70% of cases. Dose-dependent CsA toxicities included nausea and vomiting (22%), hypomagnesemia (61%), burning dysesthesias (21%), and prolongation of myelosuppression. Transient hyperbilirubinemia developed in 62% of treatment courses and was CsA-dose-dependent. Reversible azotemia occurred in three patients receiving concurrent treatment with potentially nephrotoxic antibiotics. Steady-state blood concentrations of CsA > or = 1,500 ng/mL were achieved in all patients receiving CI doses > or = 16 mg/kg/d. Mean plasma daunorubicin, but not daunorubicinol, levels were significantly elevated in patients who developed hyperbilirubinemia (P = .017). Twenty-six (62%) patients achieved a complete remission (CR) or restored chronic phase and three patients achieved a partial remission (PR) for an overall response rate of 69% (95% confidence interval, 54% to 84%). The response rate was higher in patients who developed hyperbilirubinemia (P = .001), whereas MDR phenotype did not influence response to treatment. Among five patients with MDR-positive leukemia, cellular mdr1 mRNA decreased (n = 1) or was absent from relapsed specimens (n = 4), while mdr1 RNA remained undetectable at relapse in two patients who were MDR-negative before treatment. CONCLUSION: High doses of CsA, which achieve blood concentrations capable of reversing P-glycoprotein-mediated anthracycline resistance in vitro, can be incorporated into induction regimens with acceptable nonhematologic toxicity. Transient hyperbilirubinemia occurs commonly with CsA administration and may alter daunorubicin pharmacokinetics. Recommended doses of CsA for phase II and III trials are a load of 6 mg/kg and CI of 16 mg/kg/d.","['List, A F', 'Spier, C', 'Greer, J', 'Wolff, S', 'Hutter, J', 'Dorr, R', 'Salmon, S', 'Futscher, B', 'Baier, M', 'Dalton, W']","['List AF', 'Spier C', 'Greer J', 'Wolff S', 'Hutter J', 'Dorr R', 'Salmon S', 'Futscher B', 'Baier M', 'Dalton W']","['Arizona Cancer Center, University of Arizona, Tucson 85724.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1', 'Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cyclosporine/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Drug Resistance/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/blood/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics', 'Phenotype', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",1993/09/01 00:00,1993/09/01 00:01,['1993/09/01 00:00'],"['1993/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1993.11.9.1652 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1993 Sep;11(9):1652-60. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1993.11.9.1652.,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",['J Clin Oncol. 1993 Sep;11(9):1629-35.

Conventional karyotyping revealed no evidence for a deletion and all or a majority of the affected family members were heterozygous for closely linked markers which mapped proximal to the NEFH locus (D22S1 and D22S56) and for the distal marker D22S32. FISH analysis confirmed a disease-associated germinal deletion on 22q which encompassed the NEFH locus, which is known to be very closely linked to NF2, but did not extend as far as the proximal Ewing sarcoma region or the distal leukaemia factor (LIF) locus. PFGE analysis with a LIF cosmid subclone identified patient-specific NotI and MluI fragments and suggested that the deletion is about 700 kb in length. Although this large deletion could be expected to eliminate a considerable fraction, and possibly all of the NF2 gene, the resulting phenotype is the mild, so-called Gardner subtype of NF2. The deletion should provide a useful mapping resource for characterising the chromosomal region containing the NF2 locus.","['Watson, C J', 'Gaunt, L', 'Evans, G', 'Patel, K', 'Harris, R', 'Strachan, T']","['Watson CJ', 'Gaunt L', 'Evans G', 'Patel K', 'Harris R', 'Strachan T']","[""University Department of Medical Genetics, St Mary's Hospital, Manchester, UK.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Hum Mol Genet,Human molecular genetics,9208958,IM,"['Alleles', 'Child', '*Chromosome Mapping', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 22/*ultrastructure', '*Genes, Neurofibromatosis 2', 'Genetic Linkage', '*Genetic Markers', 'Growth Inhibitors/*genetics', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*genetics', 'Neurofilament Proteins/*genetics', 'Pedigree', 'Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length', 'Sarcoma, Ewing/*genetics', '*Sequence Deletion']",1993/06/01 00:00,1993/06/01 00:01,['1993/06/01 00:00'],"['1993/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/hmg/2.6.701 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Mol Genet. 1993 Jun;2(6):701-4. doi: 10.1093/hmg/2.6.701.,"['0 (Genetic Markers)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Neurofilament Proteins)']",,,,,"['LIF', 'NEFH', 'NF2']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Blast cells were studied from 49 newly diagnosed AML patients who were subsequently treated with the ""3 and 7"" combination of cytosine arabinoside (ara-C) and DNR. DNR accumulation (1 microgram/mL, 3 hours) and retention (16 hours) were determined by flow cytometry. Cyclosporin A (CsA, 5 mumol/L) or verapamil (6.6 mumol/L) each caused significant enhancement of DNR accumulation and retention in these blast cell samples (P < .001, Wilcoxon's test). Verapamil or CsA caused greater than 20% enhancement of DNR accumulation or retention in over 25% or 50% of these patients, respectively; however, there was no correlation with the presence or degree of enhancement and response to treatment. Progesterone (10 mumol/L) caused no significant enhancement of DNR accumulation or retention. The effects of the MDR modulators on the cytotoxicity of DNR was also determined in blast cells from 40 of the patients, using a flow cytometric assay. CsA alone was cytotoxic (caused an approximate 20% decrease in cell survival compared with control, P < .001); CsA or verapamil caused enhancement of 1 mumol/L DNR cytotoxicity (P < .001). Greater than 40% enhancement of cell kill by CsA or verapamil was observed in over 75% of patients studied. There was no difference in the degree of enhancement of cytotoxicity between patients clinically sensitive or resistant to treatment. Progesterone caused no enhancement in DNR cytotoxicity. In contrast to the functional assays, highly sensitive immunoblots using the C219 antibody to Pgp showed evidence of low level expression of Pgp in blast cells from only 3 of these patients: 1 was chemotherapy resistant, 2 were sensitive. Thus, although the functional assays suggest a high frequency of expression of a classic MDR phenotype in AML patients at the time of diagnosis, with enhancement by CsA obtained at a clinically relevant concentration (5 mumol/L), the frequency of Pgp expression detectable by C219 Western blots was low in these patients. This could be interpreted either that the method used was not sufficiently sensitive to detect Pgp in all of the blast cell specimens that actually overexpressed mdr1, or that the accumulation/efflux-based MDR phenotype observed is not always mediated by Pgp in these previously untreated patients.","['Ross, D D', 'Wooten, P J', 'Sridhara, R', 'Ordonez, J V', 'Lee, E J', 'Schiffer, C A']","['Ross DD', 'Wooten PJ', 'Sridhara R', 'Ordonez JV', 'Lee EJ', 'Schiffer CA']","['University of Maryland Cancer Center, Baltimore, MD 21201.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Blotting, Western', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cyclosporine/*pharmacology', 'Daunorubicin/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Verapamil/*pharmacology']",1993/08/15 00:00,1993/08/15 00:01,['1993/08/15 00:00'],"['1993/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)84089-0 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1993 Aug 15;82(4):1288-99.,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",,,,"['R0-1-CA52178/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-1-CA40188/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Only CD38 and CD21 were significantly associated with atypical CLL morphology. The integrin associated markers CD11b and CD11c were associated with lower leukocyte count (white blood cell count [WBC]) and lower Rai stage. By contrast, the activation antigen CD23 was associated with a higher WBC, higher Rai stage, younger age group, and the presence of lymphadenopathy.

We show here that B-cell cells are sensitive to Staphylococcal enterotoxin (SE) A-directed T-cell killing. Activation of the target cells by phorbol ester (tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate, [TPA]) greatly enhances their sensitivity to lysis. In SE-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (SDCC), members of the SE superantigen family form a bridge between T cells and target cells expressing major histocompatability complex class II molecules. Binding of SEA to the T-cell-receptor V beta region induces a strong cytotoxic capacity and cytokine production. Cells from 9 B-CLL patients were cultured in the presence or absence of TPA and used as targets in a 4-hour SDCC assay using an allogeneic T-cell line as effector. At an effector:target cell ratio 30:1, 70% to 80% of TPA-induced B-CLL cells were killed. Even at the effector:target ratio of 3:1, 47% +/- 6% of TPA-activated B-cell cells were lysed compared with 13% +/- 2% of resting cells (P < .001). A T-cell line established from a B-CLL patient killed autologous tumor cells as efficiently as allogeneic effectors. SEA-directed T cells were far more lytic to B-CLL cells compared with LAK cells or lectin (phytohemagglutinin-directed T cells. Mechanisms of SDCC lysis were investigated. Effector plus target cell supernatants contained high levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interferon-gamma, but these supernatants were not directly toxic to B-CLL cells in short term culture. High concentrations of recombinant TNF-alpha or TNF-beta had no lytic effect. Addition of neutralizing anti-TNF-alpha and anti-TNF-beta antibodies into the SDCC assay did not inhibit SEA-directed T-cell killing.

CEM and CEM-VBL100 were incubated in the presence of 2-deoxyglucose, as recently proposed by our group (Clin. Chim. Acta 208: 39, 1992). Accumulation of 2-deoxyglucose 6-phosphate was much lower in the drug-resistant than in sensitive cells, indicating PP shunt activation in the MDR variants. This result was confirmed by enzymatic analyses, which demonstrated that, with respect to the parental line, the MDR variant was characterized by a) unaltered hexokinase activity; b) higher glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity; c) increased levels of reduced glutathione and marked increase of glutathione peroxidase activity after cell exposure to an oxidizing agent (tert-butylhydroperoxide). These results support the view that cell detoxification mechanisms mediated by the pentose phosphate pathway may contribute to the expression of MDR in tumours.","['Ferretti, A', 'Chen, L L', 'Di Vito, M', 'Barca, S', 'Tombesi, M', 'Cianfriglia, M', 'Bozzi, A', 'Strom, R', 'Podo, F']","['Ferretti A', 'Chen LL', 'Di Vito M', 'Barca S', 'Tombesi M', 'Cianfriglia M', 'Bozzi A', 'Strom R', 'Podo F']","['Laboratory of Cellular Biology, Istituto Superiore di Sanita, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Carrier Proteins/analysis/biosynthesis', 'Dactinomycin/toxicity', 'Doxorubicin/toxicity', 'Drug Resistance/genetics/*physiology', 'Genetic Variation', '*Glucose-6-Phosphate/*analogs & derivatives', 'Glucosephosphates/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy/methods', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/analysis/biosynthesis', '*Pentose Phosphate Pathway', 'Phosphorus', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma', 'T-Lymphocytes', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vinblastine/toxicity']",1993/07/01 00:00,1993/07/01 00:01,['1993/07/01 00:00'],"['1993/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Res. 1993 Jul-Aug;13(4):867-72.,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Glucosephosphates)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)', '27YLU75U4W (Phosphorus)', '3573-50-0 (2-deoxyglucose-6-phosphate)', '56-73-5 (Glucose-6-Phosphate)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",,,,,['MDR'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

These cells have been found to be a common target in vitro to infection and immortalization by radiation leukemia viruses (RadLVs). Many continuous lines of these cells have been generated. Since RadLV retroviruses are known to be strictly T-cell-tropic in vivo, we have questioned whether these cells are precursors of T cells. To this end, the RadLV-induced C1-V13D cell line has been inoculated into thymus of sublethally irradiated syngeneic CBA/H mice and tested for capacity to proliferate and differentiate, i.e. express T-cell markers. When inoculated in high number, C1-V13D cells can induce a thymic tumour within 14 to 21 days. Expression of T-cell markers on these cells was determined by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis, after gating out C1-V13D cells on the basis of their high 90 degree scatter and their high forward scatter. They can also be distinguished by their unique expression of RadLVgp70 envelope (env) protein, B220, CD44, and aberrant expression of a class I epitope. Explanted primary thymomas from many animals showed no evidence of T-cell marker expression on C1-V13D cells upon reisolation. However, when C1-V13D was further passaged intrathymically, there was clear expression of Thy-1, CD4, CD8, and TCR-alpha beta on C1-V13D cells reisolated from these tumours. Two-colour FACS analysis and fluorescent antibody staining have confirmed the acquisition of T-cell surface markers by C1-V13D cells growing in this environment. Northern analysis confirmed endogenous expression of T-cell receptor beta chain genes in C1-V13D cells isolated after the third passage. All data indicate that RadLV preferentially infects a unique haematopoietic precursor cell in spleen which can differentiate along the T lineage once located within the thymic environment. The cell lines described here represent valuable models for studying T-cell differentiation from lymphoid stem cells, and for dissecting the early events in leukemogenesis.","['Ho, E S', ""O'Neill, H C""]","['Ho ES', ""O'Neill HC""]","['Division of Clinical Sciences, John Curtin School of Medical Research, Canberra City, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/analysis', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Survival', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/microbiology/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred CBA', '*Radiation Leukemia Virus', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/microbiology/*pathology', 'Thymoma/immunology', 'Thymus Gland', 'Thymus Neoplasms/immunology']",1993/08/01 00:00,1993/08/01 00:01,['1993/08/01 00:00'],"['1993/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1993 Aug;7(8):1281-90.,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)']",,,,,,,,,['Leukemia 1994 May;8(5):910'],,,,,,,,,

The ICAM-1/LFA-1 complex mediates cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions and is believed to be crucial for several immunological functions, including non-MHC-restricted cytotoxicity. Recently, a circulating form of the surface ICAM-1 molecule, the 82 kDa cICAM, has been identified. Using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) we have examined 82 kDa cICAM-1 levels in the sera of 45 age- and sex-matched healthy subjects and 130 consecutive patients with Hodgkin's disease (HD). The mean +/- SD concentration of the 82 kDa cICAM-1 was significantly higher (p < 0.001) in HD patients (725.6 +/- 141 ng/ml) than in healthy controls (403.5 +/- 54.5 ng/ml). Patients with B-symptoms (n = 66) had higher cICAM-1 levels than patients without systemic symptoms (n = 64) (825.1 +/- 202.9 ng/ml versus 671.7 +/- 164.9 ng/ml; p < 0.001). Serum levels of cICAM-1 were also significantly higher (p < 0.05) in patients with disseminated disease (stage III and IV) than in those with localized disease (stage I and II). The HD patients in stage III and IV with B-symptoms had significantly higher (p < 0.001 and p < 0.02, respectively) cICAM-1 levels then stage III/IV patients lacking B-symptoms. The increase of cICAM-1 concentrations was positively correlated to increases of soluble receptors for interleukin-2 (sIL-2R) (r = 0.69; p < 0.001). Since cICAM-1 is functionally able to bind to LFA-1, increased serum levels of this molecule could be a mechanism for promoting de-adhesion and inability of Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg cells (H-RS) to be recognized by cytotoxic effector cells, and could thus represent a way for these cells to escape immunosurveillance and for progression and spreading of disease.","['Gruss, H J', 'Dolken, G', 'Brach, M A', 'Mertelsmann, R', 'Herrmann, F']","['Gruss HJ', 'Dolken G', 'Brach MA', 'Mertelsmann R', 'Herrmann F']","['Department of Internal Medicine I, University of Freiburg Medical Center, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/*blood', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Hodgkin Disease/*blood/immunology/pathology', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1', 'Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1/metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Weight', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/metabolism', 'Solubility']",1993/08/01 00:00,1993/08/01 00:01,['1993/08/01 00:00'],"['1993/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1993 Aug;7(8):1245-9.,"['0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '126547-89-5 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This HTLV-I-induced proliferation was found to be mainly mediated by the CD2 T-cell antigen, which is first expressed on double-negative lymphoid precursors after colonization of the thymus. Thus, immature thymocytes express the CD2 antigen before that of the CD3-TCR complex. We therefore investigated the responsiveness of these CD2+CD3- immature thymocytes and compared it with that of unseparated thymocytes, containing a majority of the CD2+CD3+ mature thymocytes, and that of the CD2-CD3- prothymocytes. Both immature and unseparated thymocytes were incorporating [3H]thymidine in response to the virus, provided that they were cultivated in the presence of submitogenic doses of phytohemagglutinin. In contrast, the prothymocytes did not proliferate. Downmodulation of the CD2 molecule by incubating unseparated and immature thymocytes with a single anti-CD2 monoclonal antibody inhibited the proliferative response to HTLV-I. These results clearly underline that the expression of the CD2 molecule is exclusively required in mediating the proliferative response to the synergistic effect of phytohemagglutinin and HTLV-I. Immature thymocytes treated with a pair of anti-CD2 monoclonal antibodies were shown to proliferate in response to HTLV-I, even in the absence of exogenous IL-2. We further verified that the proliferation of human thymocytes is consecutive to the expression of IL-2 receptors and the synthesis of IL-2. These observations provide evidence that the mitogenic stimulus delivered by HTLV-I is more efficient than that provided by other conventional mitogenic stimuli, which are unable to trigger the synthesis of endogenous IL-2. Collectively, these results show that the mitogenic activity of HTLV-I is able to trigger the proliferation of cells which are at an early stage of T-cell development. They might therefore represent target cells in which HTLV-I infection could favor the initiation of the multistep lymphoproliferative process leading to adult T-cell leukemia.","['Maguer, V', 'Casse-Ripoll, H', 'Gazzolo, L', 'Dodon, M D']","['Maguer V', 'Casse-Ripoll H', 'Gazzolo L', 'Dodon MD']","['Immuno-Virologie Moleculaire et Cellulaire, UMR30, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique/Universite Claude Bernard Lyon I, Faculte de Medecine A.

Mast cell lines (Elut cells) or multipotent cell lines (FDC-Pmix) were infected with MPSV-based replication defective retroviral vectors carrying either the neomycin resistance gene alone (M3neoV) or the neomycin gene plus the IL-3 gene (M3MuV).

Irradiated and non-irradiated virus-producing Elut cells and the virus-producing FDC-Pmix cells were transplanted into syngeneic mice to ""target"" virus infection to the sites of hemopoiesis.

Hematopoietic cell lines were rescued from diseased and control mice. In all cases these cell lines were of host origin. Cell lines derived from control mice were of basophil/mast cell morphology only, and required IL-3 for their continued proliferation (similar to cell lines derived from uninfected animals), whereas the cell lines generated from spleen and bone marrow cells of host mice with myeloproliferative disease carried the M3MuV vector, were G418 resistant and IL-3 independent. The biologic properties of M3MuV infected host derived cell lines varied considerably. Some were multipotential and could be induced to differentiate in response to stromal cells and serum factors, others were more restricted to the granulocyte/macrophage lineage but were also differentiation inducible, and some were blocked in differentiation at the myeloblast/promyelocyte stage. We conclude that the injected donor cells acted as ""infectious centers"" to facilitate the infection of host hematopoietic cells with the M3MuV vector.

The concomitant appearance of non-viable cells as estimated by either orcein staining or eosin dye staining correlated well with this. Early cell swelling and a diffuse smear pattern in DNA gel electrophoresis were however suggestive of necrosis. Detailed electron microscopic observations revealed that events leading to the interphase death of Molt-4 cells after 2-30 Gy involved complicated pathways which included both apoptotic changes in the nucleus and necrotic changes in the cytoplasm. TPA not only had a protective effect on the interphase death of Molt-4 cells, but also converted the mode of cell death from interphase death to mitotic death after low doses of radiation. Cycloheximide and H-7, known to inhibit apoptosis in irradiated thymocytes, had no protective effect on the interphase death of Molt-4 cells, suggesting that the events leading to interphase death in Molt-4 cells might be different from those in thymocytes. BrdUrd-labelling had a sensitizing effect on the radiation response, but no effect on interphase death in Molt-4 cells thus suggesting that DNA damage may not be responsible for interphase death.","['Akagi, Y', 'Ito, K', 'Sawada, S']","['Akagi Y', 'Ito K', 'Sawada S']","['Department of Radiology, School of Medicine, Hiroshima University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Int J Radiat Biol,International journal of radiation biology,8809243,IM,"['1-(5-Isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-Methylpiperazine', 'Bromodeoxyuridine/pharmacology', '*Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'Isoquinolines/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid', 'Necrosis', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/*radiation effects']",1993/07/01 00:00,1993/07/01 00:01,['1993/07/01 00:00'],"['1993/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['UKKYG08KMVX2CX13 [pii]', '10.1080/09553009314551101 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Radiat Biol. 1993 Jul;64(1):47-56. doi: 10.1080/09553009314551101.,"['0 (Isoquinolines)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '84477-87-2 (1-(5-Isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-Methylpiperazine)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'G34N38R2N1 (Bromodeoxyuridine)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thymidine phosphorylase (dThdPase) is an enzyme involved in pyrimidine nucleoside metabolism, but little is known about its physiological functions. We purified dThdPase from human placenta, and isolated partial cDNA clones for dThdPase. Amino-acid sequences were deduced from nucleotide sequences of the longest clone (288 base pairs). This sequence was 100% identical to the sequence of platelet derived endothelial cell growth factor (PD-ECGF) (residues 149-244). dThdPase is one of the activating enzymes for fluorinated pyrimidines.

It has also been observed that HL60/ADR overexpress the MRP gene which was first identified as a component of a non-P-glycoprotein mediated multidrug resistance of H69/ADR cells [Cole et al., Science (Washington DC), 258: 1650, 1992]. A complementary DNA of MRP has been cloned and based on the deduced sequence encodes a member of the superfamily of proteins which bind ATP and function in various transport processes [Cole et al., Science (Washington DC), 258: 1650, 1992]. In view of this it was of interest to identify the protein encoded by MRP and determine if it may be related to p190. In the present study we have prepared antisera against three synthetic peptides which correspond to the deduced sequence of the MRP protein. Proteins reactive with the antisera have been examined in HL60/ADR cells using Western blot analysis. All antisera react with a 190 kDa protein contained in membranes of resistant but not sensitive cells. One antiserum used for further studies is not reactive with P-glycoprotein contained in membranes of HL60 cells isolated for resistance to vincristine. Analysis of subcellular fractions demonstrates that p190 is present primarily in the endoplasmic reticulum with lower levels also present in plasma membranes. Treatment of HL60/ADR cells with tunicamycin results in the appearance of a 165-kDa resistance associated protein which reacts with the antipeptide serum. The results of this study therefore demonstrate that the MRP gene encodes a 190-kDa membrane bound glycoprotein.","['Krishnamachary, N', 'Center, M S']","['Krishnamachary N', 'Center MS']","['Division of Biology, Kansas State University, Manhattan 66506.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Blotting, Western', 'Carrier Proteins/analysis', 'Doxorubicin', 'Drug Resistance/*genetics', '*Genes', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/genetics', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*analysis/chemistry', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Molecular Weight', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*analysis/chemistry', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/08/15 00:00,1993/08/15 00:01,['1993/08/15 00:00'],"['1993/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1993 Aug 15;53(16):3658-61.,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",,,,['CA-37585/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['MPR'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have recently demonstrated in 5/8 CML patients with blastic phase (BP) that the blood progenitor cells/(BPC) harvested during early recovery from marrow aplasia were Ph-negative on cytogenetic analysis, suggesting that leukapheresis may provide a useful source of 'normal' progenitors for subsequent reinfusions. We report here an update on 40 patients with Ph + CML and 9 patients with ALL in first or subsequent relapses with associated cytogenetic translocations including t(8;14) t(4;8) t(4;11) and t(9;22). All these patients received intensive conventional chemotherapy and during early recovery from marrow aplasia, when the WBC reached 0.5-2.0 x 10(9)/L, BPC were collected by 4-8 leukapheresis and tested for the persistence of the marker translocations and, when possible, for the presence of the hybrid bcr/abl transcripts by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In seven out of 10 patients with chronic phase CML, BPC were Ph-negative and in 5 PCR negative. In both accelerated phase patients, BPC were Ph-negative but PCR-positive and in eight out of 28 blastic CML patients, BPC were Ph-negative and in two cases also PCR-negative. Six out of 9 ALL patients, lost the cytogenic translocations.

Their expression patterns, analyzed with a panel of leukemia-derived cell lines representing various blood cells phenotypes, appears to be lineage-restricted. Extending our study to all the known members of the HOX 1 and HOX 2 clusters, we found that HOX 1 genes are predominantly detected within cell of myelomonocytic origin whereas HOX 2 genes transcripts are principally expressed in erythro-megakaryocytic cell lines. Furthermore, we have observed that the expression of three HOX 1 genes within B lymphoid lineages is stage-related and that the expression of several of them is switched off during TPA-induced differentiation of KG1 and U937 cells.

Of the 82 patients with ATL who the authors saw between 1981 and 1991, spontaneous regression occurred in 3 (3.7%), 2 of whom were previously untreated and one who had been previously treated. Surgical excisional biopsy triggered the spontaneous regression in these patients. METHODS: In two of these patients with spontaneous regression, gene analysis studies of human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I) proviral DNA, and T-cell receptor (TCR) were carried out by Southern blot analysis in lymph node cells or peripheral lymphocytes before regression and after recurrence. RESULTS: One patient exhibited monoclonal integration of HTLV-I proviral DNA and the rearranged band of the TCR-beta gene at the same positions both before regression and after recurrence. The other patient showed them at the different positions before regression and after recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: The authors' studies indicated heterogeneity in ATL patients with spontaneous regression. Temporary spontaneous regression could occur in typical ATL and might be associated with a longer survival time than that for prototypic ATL.","['Shimamoto, Y', 'Kikuchi, M', 'Funai, N', 'Suga, K', 'Matsuzaki, M', 'Yamaguchi, M']","['Shimamoto Y', 'Kikuchi M', 'Funai N', 'Suga K', 'Matsuzaki M', 'Yamaguchi M']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Saga Medical School, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['Blotting, Southern', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'DNA, Viral/*analysis', 'Deltaretrovirus Antibodies/analysis', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics/immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Regression, Spontaneous/*genetics', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/genetics']",1993/08/01 00:00,1993/08/01 00:01,['1993/08/01 00:00'],"['1993/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19930801)72:3<735::aid-cncr2820720317>3.0.co;2-o [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1993 Aug 1;72(3):735-40. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19930801)72:3<735::aid-cncr2820720317>3.0.co;2-o.,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Deltaretrovirus Antibodies)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The volume of PBSCs transfused varied from 46 to 500 mL (219.6 +/- 118.4 mL, mean +/- SD), with a mean of 0.91 g per kg of dimethyl sulfoxide. Insignificant and transient toxicities included hemoglobinuria in 40 patients (74%), headache in 38 (70%), nausea in 37 (69%), and vomiting in 25 patients (46%). Significant shock developed in 8 patients (15%), but they recovered quickly, whether they had supportive therapy or not. Vomiting and hyperbilirubinemia were the only toxicities that showed a correlation with the amount of PBSCs transfused. The data suggest that transient toxicity associated with PBSC autografts is rather common in children, and close observation of patients for possible serious morbidity is required.","['Okamoto, Y', 'Takaue, Y', 'Saito, S', 'Shimizu, T', 'Suzue, T', 'Abe, T', 'Sato, J', 'Hirao, A', 'Watanabe, T', 'Kawano, Y']","['Okamoto Y', 'Takaue Y', 'Saito S', 'Shimizu T', 'Suzue T', 'Abe T', 'Sato J', 'Hirao A', 'Watanabe T', 'Kawano Y', 'et al.']","['Department of Pediatrics, University Hospital of Tokushima, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Transfusion,Transfusion,0417360,IM,"['Adolescent', '*Blood Preservation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Cryopreservation', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*surgery', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/surgery', 'Male', 'Neuroblastoma/surgery', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*surgery', 'Retinoblastoma/surgery', 'Transplantation, Autologous/*adverse effects']",1993/07/01 00:00,1993/07/01 00:01,['1993/07/01 00:00'],"['1993/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1537-2995.1993.33793325053.x [doi]'],ppublish,Transfusion. 1993 Jul;33(7):578-81. doi: 10.1046/j.1537-2995.1993.33793325053.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This function has been attributed to the coordinated binding of subunits of NF-kappa B to distinct regions of the promoter elements of numerous genes, including cytokines, growth factor receptors, and adhesion molecules. Antisense phosphorothioate oligonucleotides to the p50 and p65 subunits of the NF-kappa B complex were used to define the physiologic role of this transcription factor in resting and stimulated granulocytes. A reduction in the expression of p65 was produced by treatment with the phosphorothioate antisense oligodeoxynucleotide. This reduction was accompanied by rapid changes in the cellular adhesion of dimethyl sulfoxide-differentiated HL-60 leukemia cells stimulated by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA). These effects were characterized by a marked reduction in CD11b integrin expression on the surface of treated cells. Furthermore, the p65 antisense oligomer effectively abolished an upregulation of CD11b that was produced by formyl-met-leu-phe and TPA. However, the p65 antisense phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotide had no significant effect on the production of reactive oxygen intermediates or on phagocytosis by these cells.

DESIGN: Phase II clinical study. SETTING: Referral cancer center. PARTICIPANTS: Five patients with hairy cell leukemia who had been previously treated with DCF. INTERVENTION: Single course of 2-CdA at 0.1 mg/kg body weight per day for 7 days by continuous intravenous infusion. RESULTS: Of five patients, three were resistant to and two were intolerant of (having had life-threatening toxic reactions) DCF therapy. Four patients obtained a complete response with a median follow-up period of more than 11 months. The other patient in whom splenectomy, interferon, and DCF treatments were unsuccessful had a partial response lasting 2 months and subsequently died of Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteremia. Three of the four patients with complete responses remain in unmaintained remission, whereas the fourth has progressive splenic enlargement with stable hematologic parameters. The median leukocyte count increased from 2.0 x 10(9)/L to 3.8 x 10(9)/L, the median absolute neutrophil count increased from 0.56 x 10(9)/L to 2.73 x 10(9)/L, the median hemoglobin level increased from 112 g/L to 140 g/L, and the median platelet count increased from 55 x 10(9)/L to 123 x 10(9)/L. Two patients had culture-negative neutropenic fever associated with treatment. CONCLUSIONS: 2-Chlorodeoxyadenosine induced complete responses in patients with hairy cell leukemia resistant to DCF, suggesting a lack of cross-resistance.

Studies on loss of heterozygosity, parental origin of deleted genes and prognosis.",748-53,"A restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of the alpha- and beta-interferon (IFN) genes was performed in malignant cells from 52 patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL). Normal cell DNA was available for comparison in 23 of the patients. Ten patients were found to have gross alterations of their alpha- and beta-IFN genes. Leukemic cells from 2 ALL patients showed a complete loss of alpha- and beta-IFN genes. Seven patients had a hemizygous loss of one of the alpha- and beta-IFN alleles, as shown by RFLP analysis and/or loss of signal intensity. In one other patient the malignant clone was reduced to homozygosity with regard to the alpha- and beta-IFN genes, without loss of signal intensity. In patients without hemizygous deletions, the overall incidence of complete homozygosity for the alpha- and beta polymorphisms was higher than expected. Analysis of the data indicates that the total frequency of ALL clones with gross alterations of the IFN-loci is around 30%. A 9p24 probe detected hemizygous deletions in 2 cases of IFN gene deletions. In the other tested cases the deletions were interstitial. No deletions of 9p24 were detected in patients without allelic losses of IFN genes. In 5 cases of allelic IFN gene deletions, DNA from parents was available for comparison. In 4 cases the deleted allele was derived from the mother, whereas in the fifth it originated from the father. Pediatric ALL patients with IFN-gene deletions or homozygosity for all polymorphisms in the IFN-loci had a significantly worse prognosis than heterozygotes. We conclude that deletion of alpha- and beta-IFN genes is a relatively common event in ALL and that RFLP analysis of the IFN genes may provide additional prognostic information in childhood ALL. Whether or not the IFNs act as tumor-suppressor genes in this disease is not yet known.","['Heyman, M', 'Grander, D', 'Brondum-Nielsen, K', 'Liu, Y', 'Soderhall, S', 'Einhorn, S']","['Heyman M', 'Grander D', 'Brondum-Nielsen K', 'Liu Y', 'Soderhall S', 'Einhorn S']","['Division of Experimental Oncology, Radiumhemmet, Karolinska Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chromosome Deletion', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Interferon-alpha/*genetics', 'Interferon-beta/*genetics', 'Karyotyping', 'Male', 'Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Prognosis']",1993/07/09 00:00,1993/07/09 00:01,['1993/07/09 00:00'],"['1993/07/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/07/09 00:01 [medline]', '1993/07/09 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.2910540507 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1993 Jul 9;54(5):748-53. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910540507.,"['0 (Interferon-alpha)', '77238-31-4 (Interferon-beta)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Agents generally associated with the multidrug-resistant phenotype include inhibitors of topoisomerase II, e.g., doxorubicin, etoposide, and the microtubule poisons such as vinblastine, vincristine (VCR), and taxol. The antiepileptic drug phenytoin (DPH), an inhibitor of tubulin polymerization, potentiates (P < 0.05) the cytotoxicity of the chemotherapeutically useful microtubule poison VCR in tumor cells with the wild-type or multidrug-resistant phenotype. Among agents associated with the multidrug-resistant phenotype, the modulation of cytotoxicity by DPH was selectively effective with the microtubule poison VCR but not the topoisomerase II inhibitor doxorubicin. The potentiation of vincristine cytotoxicity by DPH was not due to binding to P-glycoprotein or by increasing VCR accumulation. We thus propose a novel mechanism for the modulation of resistance based on evidence that DPH at noncytotoxic concentrations can selectively enhance the cytotoxic potential of vincristine without interfering with P-glycoprotein function. Thus, studies with phenytoin could assist in characterizing other molecular determinants of multidrug resistance and the design of trials to modulate drug efficacy.","['Ganapathi, R', 'Hercbergs, A', 'Grabowski, D', 'Ford, J']","['Ganapathi R', 'Hercbergs A', 'Grabowski D', 'Ford J']","['Department of Cancer Biology, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Ohio 44195.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1', 'Animals', 'Carrier Proteins/metabolism', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Resistance/genetics', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Leukemia P388/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Phenotype', 'Phenytoin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vincristine/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology']",1993/07/15 00:00,1993/07/15 00:01,['1993/07/15 00:00'],"['1993/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1993 Jul 15;53(14):3262-5.,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '6158TKW0C5 (Phenytoin)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",,,,['CA35531/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['mdr'],,,,['Cancer Res 1993 Dec 15;53(24):6079'],,,,,,,,,

Patients older than 45 years of age were significantly more often P-glycoprotein-positive (11/25) at diagnosis than younger patients (2/26).

When assayed in vitro, a murine anti-human LFA-1 (alpha subunit) monoclonal antibody (mAb) inhibits up to 80% of JY lymphoma cell invasion. When assayed in vivo, a rat anti-LFA-1 (alpha subunit) mAb significantly inhibited the development of experimental metastases, when administered concomitantly with either P815 or EL4 tumor cells. The leukocyte integrins, particularly LFA-1, may represent useful targets for the therapeutic modulation of metastasis.","['Harning, R', 'Myers, C', 'Merluzzi, V J']","['Harning R', 'Myers C', 'Merluzzi VJ']","['Roberts Pharmaceutical Corporation, Research and Development Eatontown, NJ 07724.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Clin Exp Metastasis,Clinical & experimental metastasis,8409970,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*pharmacology', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/metabolism', 'Cell Movement', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1', 'Liver Neoplasms/secondary', 'Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1/immunology/*physiology', 'Lymphocytes/physiology', 'Lymphoma/*pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Time Factors']",1993/07/01 00:00,1993/07/01 00:01,['1993/07/01 00:00'],"['1993/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00058054 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Exp Metastasis. 1993 Jul;11(4):337-42. doi: 10.1007/BF00058054.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1)', '126547-89-5 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unfractionated cord blood mononuclear cells (CBMC), or a separated CD4+ T cell subpopulation (CBCD4) were exposed to HTLV-I by cocultivation with a chronically infected virus-donor cell line. The results show that presence of proviral DNA as well as virus transcription was markedly reduced by IFN beta in both populations, indicating that this cytokine protects not only unfractionated CBMC but also purified CBCD4 cells from virus infection. Moreover IFN beta treatment caused 60%-80% inhibition of virus expression in CBCD4, assayed as the presence of virus core protein p19. This study demonstrates that IFN beta is able to inhibit HTLV-I infection of CBMC through a mechanism that does not necessarily involve cell-mediated natural or antigen-dependent immunity afforded by CBMC subpopulations distinct from targets of HTLV-I infection. Therefore it is reasonable to conclude that IFN beta has a direct protective effect on CBCD4, through induction of antiviral resistance/activity in target cells.","['Macchi, B', 'Faraoni, I', 'Mastino, A', ""D'Onofrio, C"", 'Romeo, G', 'Bonmassar, E']","['Macchi B', 'Faraoni I', 'Mastino A', ""D'Onofrio C"", 'Romeo G', 'Bonmassar E']","['Department of Experimental Medicine and Biochemical Sciences, University of Rome Tor Vergata, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,IM,"[""2',5'-Oligoadenylate Synthetase/drug effects"", 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*drug effects', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/drug effects', 'Enzyme Induction/drug effects', 'Fetal Blood/*immunology', 'HTLV-I Infections/immunology/*prevention & control', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*drug effects/pathogenicity', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Interferon-beta/*pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Viral Core Proteins/drug effects']",1993/07/01 00:00,1993/07/01 00:01,['1993/07/01 00:00'],"['1993/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF01517041 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 1993 Jul;37(2):97-104. doi: 10.1007/BF01517041.,"['0 (Viral Core Proteins)', '77238-31-4 (Interferon-beta)', ""EC 2.7.7.84 (2',5'-Oligoadenylate Synthetase)""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Their development has benefited greatly from a rapid concomitant advance of experimental knowledge regarding the nature of hematopoietic progenitor cells. For this reason and also for technical ones, until now these transplants generally have been autotransplants. Although one of the main reasons to use blood rather than bone marrow-derived stem cells was that they might carry less risk of relapse than autologous bone marrow cells, the lack of clinical randomized trials and/or the short follow-up make conclusions difficult so far in terms of disease-free and overall survival. Probably the risk of relapse also depends on the type of disease, on prior chemotherapies, on the type of peripheral stem cell mobilization regimen and on the number of blood-derived cells transplanted. Nevertheless, there are several major clinical indications for autologous blood stem cell transplant: acute nonlymphoblastic leukemias (ANLL), low-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, multiple myeloma, some solid tumors, and even chronic myeloid leukemia. Now well-demonstrated advantages add a socioeconomic interest to this technique. The speed of post-transplant hematopoietic recovery induces a briefer hospitalization and a lower cost of the procedure, which represents ""per se"" important progress. Furthermore, the increasing use of hematopoietic growth factor(s) at time of blood-derived cell mobilization should increase the safety of the procedure. Also new trends are currently being developed: autotransplants with purified peripheral CD34+ cells; addition of adjuvant immunotherapy to induce graft-versus-tumor effect, which is lacking in autotransplant; and transplants using allogenic umbilical cord blood progenitors. Allogenic blood cell transplants might also be developed, provided that blood cells would be less likely to cause graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) than bone marrow, which is still not verified. Finally, the use of blood-derived cells as a vehicle for gene therapy should develop greatly in the near future.","['Henon, P R']",['Henon PR'],"['Institut de Recherche en Hematologie et Transfusion, Hopital du Hasenrain, Mulhouse, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Stem Cells,"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",9304532,IM,"['Animals', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans']",1993/05/01 00:00,1993/05/01 00:01,['1993/05/01 00:00'],"['1993/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/stem.5530110302 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells. 1993 May;11(3):154-72. doi: 10.1002/stem.5530110302.,,,119,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have studied the germline representation of 51p1 and closely related VH elements to establish their prevalence and allelic relationship. A panel of oligonucleotide probes directed to the complementarity determining regions (CDR1 and CDR2) of 51p1 and a similar gene, hv1263, was used in restriction fragment polymorphism analysis of 48 unrelated individuals and six families. 13 VH alleles to the 51p1 locus were identified, each distinguished by its restriction fragment size, hybridization profile, or both. On some haplotypes the locus was duplicated. Null alleles were not seen. The 13 alleles were cloned, yielding nine distinct nucleotide sequences that were > 98.2% identical and included 51p1 and hv1263. These germline variations could influence specificity for antigen, because the corresponding protein sequences differed by up to five amino acids, including three nonconservative changes in the CDR. Two of the most prevalent variants contained 51p1. These findings expand the spectrum of polymorphism seen among human VH genes and elucidate the germline origin of VH1 sequences frequently expressed in autoantibodies and CLL.

To improve this therapy, various factors involved in in vivo induction of differentiation of leukemia cells should be clarified. Clinical studies showed that inducers of differentiation of leukemia cells including retinoic acid, hexamethylene bisacetamide and some chemotherapeutic drugs induced remission in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia. Clonal analysis of the matured granulocytes revealed that the effectiveness of these drugs was due to their ability to induce differentiation of the leukemic cells rather than their cytocidal activity. On the other hand, various types of agents have been found to induce in vitro differentiation of leukemia line cells and fresh human leukemic cells. To evaluate therapeutic efficacy of these differentiation-inducing agents, pre-clinical experiments using animal model and tests for in vivo inducibility of differentiation of the leukemia cells are essential.

The present study was undertaken to clarify the role of T cell growth factor, interleukin-2 (IL-2), in the expression of PTHRP gene, using a human T cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I)-infected T cell line, MT-2. Recombinant human IL-2 caused a transient increase in the steady state level of PTHRP messenger RNA (mRNA) in MT-2 cells, and a maximal effect was observed at 3-6 h. The effect of IL-2 was dose dependent, with a maximal response being observed at 10(-10) M. A monoclonal antibody against IL-2 receptor (anti-Tac antibody) inhibited the IL-2-induced increase in PTHRP mRNA level. Recombinant human IL-1, IL-3, IL-4, and IL-6 failed to increase PTHRP mRNA level. Nuclear run-off transcription assay showed that the transcription rate of the PTHRP gene was modestly increased by IL-2. In addition, IL-2 caused a substantial increase in the stability of PTHRP mRNA, compared with control cells in which the apparent half-life of PTHRP mRNA was less than 30 min after RNA synthesis was inhibited by the RNA polymerase II inhibitor, dichlorobenzimidazole riboside. The secretion of PTHRP, as determined by both a newly established immunoradiometric assay using recombinant human PTHRP(1-87) as the standard and an RIA using an antibody against PTHRP(109-141), was increased by IL-2 but not by IL-1, IL-3, IL-4, or IL-6. The IL-2-induced increase in PTHRP secretion was completely inhibited by the addition of anti-Tac antibody. These results demonstrate that IL-2 stimulates the production and secretion of PTHRP by HTLV-I-infected T cells through specific binding to IL-2 receptor and that the effect of IL-2 is mediated by a posttranscriptional as well as a transcriptional mechanism. It is suggested that IL-2 may be involved in an auctocrine/paracrine fashion not only in the proliferation of HTLV-I-infected T cells but also in the enhanced production and secretion of PTHRP and thus the development of hypercalcemia in ATL patients.","['Ikeda, K', 'Okazaki, R', 'Inoue, D', 'Ohno, H', 'Ogata, E', 'Matsumoto, T']","['Ikeda K', 'Okazaki R', 'Inoue D', 'Ohno H', 'Ogata E', 'Matsumoto T']","['Fourth Department of Internal Medicine, University of Tokyo School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Endocrinology,Endocrinology,0375040,IM,"['Blotting, Northern', 'Deltaretrovirus Infections/*metabolism/pathology', '*Human T-lymphotropic virus 1', 'Humans', 'Hypercalcemia/complications', 'Immunoradiometric Assay', 'Interleukin-2/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/complications', 'Parathyroid Hormone-Related Protein', 'Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Radioimmunoassay', 'T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/06/01 00:00,1993/06/01 00:01,['1993/06/01 00:00'],"['1993/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1210/endo.132.6.8099324 [doi]'],ppublish,Endocrinology. 1993 Jun;132(6):2551-6. doi: 10.1210/endo.132.6.8099324.,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (PTHLH protein, human)', '0 (Parathyroid Hormone-Related Protein)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Effects of radiations of different qualities on cells: molecular mechanisms of damage and repair.,543-56,"Studies of ionizing radiations of different quality are discussed with particular emphasis on damage to DNA of mammalian cells. Three related themes are followed. Firstly, inactivation and mutation experiments with ultrasoft X-rays and slow heavy ions, coupled with theoretical analyses of the structures of the radiation tracks, have emphasized the biological importance of localized track features over nanometre dimensions. This led to the suggestion that the critical physical features of the tracks are the stochastic clusterings of ionizations, directly in or very near to DNA, resulting in clustered initial molecular damage including various combinations of breaks, base damages, cross-links, etc. in the DNA. The quantitative hypotheses imply that final cellular effects from high-LET radiations are dominated by their more severe, and therefore less repairable, clustered damage, and that these are qualitatively different from the dominant low-LET damage. Second, relative effectiveness of different types of radiation led to questions on the mechanisms of induction of chromosome exchanges. The high efficiency of ultrasoft X-rays, despite their very short track lengths, suggested that single sites of DNA damage may lead to exchanges by a molecular process involving interaction with undamaged DNA. Also it is shown that a single site-specific DNA break, introduced by restriction enzymes, sometimes leads to a large deletion when misrepaired by cell extracts. These deletions occur between short DNA repeats, and are therefore a form of 'illegitimate' recombination, but clearly do not involve the interaction of two damage sites. Third, it was shown that cells from patients with the radiosensitive disorder ataxia-telangiectasia (AT) lack a post-irradiation recovery process. The sensitivity of AT cells to high LET radiations was found to be reduced relative to that for normal cells, reinforcing the concept that high LET damage is less easy to repair. AT patients are prone to lymphoreticular cancers, and their cells show characteristic chromosomal rearrangements, which may be associated with misrepair at specific genomic sequences. Similarly, studies of radiation-induced leukaemia in the mouse have implicated rearrangement at specific interstitial chromosome sites, which are rich in telomere-like repeat sequences.","['Goodhead, D T', 'Thacker, J', 'Cox, R']","['Goodhead DT', 'Thacker J', 'Cox R']","['Medical Research Council Radiobiology Unit, Chilton, Didcot, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Int J Radiat Biol,International journal of radiation biology,8809243,IM,"['Animals', 'Ataxia Telangiectasia/genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'Cells/*radiation effects', 'Cricetinae', 'DNA/*radiation effects', '*DNA Damage', '*DNA Repair', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Radiation Genetics']",1993/05/01 00:00,1993/05/01 00:01,['1993/05/01 00:00'],"['1993/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/09553009314450721 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Radiat Biol. 1993 May;63(5):543-56. doi: 10.1080/09553009314450721.,['9007-49-2 (DNA)'],,94,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A marked variation existed in the pattern and extent of leukemic cell engraftment in SCID mice challenged with t(1;19) pre-B ALL blasts. Blasts from some patients caused disseminated leukemia that was detected by histopathology and/or flow cytometry, whereas blasts from other patients produced occult leukemia that was only detected by flow cytometry and/or polymerase-chain reaction. Notably, the ability of primary t(1;19) pre-B ALL blasts to cause disseminated leukemia in SCID mice was associated with poor prognosis. Six of six patients whose blasts caused disseminated leukemia in SCID mice relapsed at a median of 7.8 months (range: 5.7 to 25.2 months). In contrast, the remaining four patients whose blasts did not engraft or only partially engrafted remain in complete remission at 28 to 47 months. A new E2A-PBX-1 fusion transcript positive t(1;19) pre-B ALL cell line (designated LC1;19) with the composite immunophenotype CD7-CD10+CD19+CD45-HLA-DR+C mu+ was established by expanding BM blasts from a SCID mouse, which died of human t(1;19) ALL at 7 weeks after inoculation of primary leukemic blasts from a t(1;19) ALL patient. This cell line caused disseminated and invariably fatal leukemia when greater than 10(4) cells were injected intravenously into SCID mice. Total body irradiation followed by syngeneic BM transplantation (BMT) showed limited efficacy against LC1;19 leukemia in SCID mice. To our knowledge, this study is the first to (1) examine the in vivo growth of primary t(1;19) pre-B ALL blasts in SCID mice and (2) show that leukemic blasts from a majority of newly diagnosed t(1;19) pre-B ALL patients cause disseminated human leukemia in SCID mice. Our results indicate that t(1;19) pre-B ALL is biologically heterogeneous with regard to its in vivo growth pattern in SCID mice, a feature that may be predictive of prognosis. The described LC1;19 SCID mouse model may prove particularly useful for designing more effective treatment strategies against poor-prognosis t(1;19) ALL.","['Uckun, F M', 'Downing, J R', 'Gunther, R', 'Chelstrom, L M', 'Finnegan, D', 'Land, V J', 'Borowitz, M J', 'Carroll, A J', 'Crist, W M']","['Uckun FM', 'Downing JR', 'Gunther R', 'Chelstrom LM', 'Finnegan D', 'Land VJ', 'Borowitz MJ', 'Carroll AJ', 'Crist WM']","['Tumor Immunology Laboratory, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis 55455.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Animals', 'Child', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 1', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 19', 'Clone Cells', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes, Homeobox', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/genetics/*pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transcription Factors/genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']",1993/06/01 00:00,1993/06/01 00:01,['1993/06/01 00:00'],"['1993/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)71548-X [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1993 Jun 1;81(11):3052-62.,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",,,,"['R01 CA-42633/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA-44114/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA-51425/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']","['E2A', 'PBX1']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The eight AML cases consisted of heterogeneous cell populations; mainly due to the presence of multiple subpopulations, which varied in size between the patients. However, the immunophenotype of these subpopulations was comparable, independent of their relative sizes. Virtually all AML-M4Eo cells were positive for the pan-myeloid marker CD13. In addition, the AML were partly positive for CD2, CD11b, CD11c, CD14, CD33, CD34, CD36, CDw65, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT), and HLA-DR. Double immunofluorescence stainings demonstrated coexpression of the CD2 antigen and myeloid markers and allowed the recognition of multiple AML subpopulations. The CD2 antigen was expressed by immature AML cells (CD34+, CD14-) and more mature monocytic AML cells (CD34-, CD14+), whereas TdT expression was exclusively found in the CD34+, CD14- cell population. The eight AML-M4Eo cases not only expressed the CD2 antigen, but also its ligand CD58 (leukocyte function antigen-3). Culturing of AML-M4Eo cell samples showed a high spontaneous proliferation in all three patients tested. Addition of a mixture of CD2 antibodies against the T11.1, T11.2, and T11.3 epitopes diminished cell proliferation in two patients with high CD2 expression, but no inhibitory effects were found in the third patient with low frequency and low density of CD2 expression. These results suggest that high expression of the CD2 molecule in AML-M4Eo stimulates proliferation of the leukemic cells, which might explain the high white blood cell count often found in this type of AML.","['Adriaansen, H J', 'te Boekhorst, P A', 'Hagemeijer, A M', 'van der Schoot, C E', 'Delwel, H R', 'van Dongen, J J']","['Adriaansen HJ', 'te Boekhorst PA', 'Hagemeijer AM', 'van der Schoot CE', 'Delwel HR', 'van Dongen JJ']","['Department of Immunology, University Hospital Dijkzigt/Erasmus University, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/*metabolism', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'CD2 Antigens', 'Child', 'Chromosome Aberrations/pathology', 'Chromosome Disorders', 'Chromosome Inversion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 16', 'Eosinophilia/genetics/immunology/*pathology', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/genetics/immunology/*pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*metabolism']",1993/06/01 00:00,1993/06/01 00:01,['1993/06/01 00:00'],"['1993/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)71547-8 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1993 Jun 1;81(11):3043-51.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (CD2 Antigens)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The regulatory effect of these two receptors on intercellular adhesion molecules (ICAM-1) expression was examined in various human cell lines in vitro, including human lymphokine-activated killer T cells (T-LAK) cells and HL-60 cells. Rabbit antihuman TNF-R antisera specific for each receptor were employed as probes to selectively stimulate 55- and 75-kDa TNF/LT membrane receptor production. These antisera compete with TNF/LT binding to each specific cell membrane receptor and have been found to bind to specific membrane receptors on various human cell lines in vitro. In the present study, we demonstrated biologic activity for anti-55-kDa TNF-R antiserum. For example, antibodies that bind to the 55-kDa TNF-R caused cytolysis of HeLa and ME-180 human cervical cancer cells and induced proliferation of MRC-5 human fibroblasts. In contrast, however, anti-75-kDa TNF-R antiserum demonstrated no bioactivity in these assays. In addition, no synergy or costimulation was observed when a combination of both anti-55- and anti-75-kDa TNF-R antisera were tested in these assay systems. Anti-55-kDa TNF-R antiserum up-regulated ICAM-1 expression on human HL-60, T-LAK, and THP-1 cells, whereas anti-75-kDa TNF-R antiserum had no effect. Unexpectedly, however, ICAM-1 expression was greatly enhanced by the addition of anti-75-kDa TNF-R to the anti-55-kDa TNF-R containing culture. This enhancing effect was also observed with human T-LAK cells and THP-1 monocytic leukemia cell, in vitro.","['Abe, Y', 'Gatanaga, M', 'Osuka, Y', 'Kimura, S', 'Burger, R A', 'Granger, G A', 'Gatanaga, T']","['Abe Y', 'Gatanaga M', 'Osuka Y', 'Kimura S', 'Burger RA', 'Granger GA', 'Gatanaga T']","['Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, University of California, Irvine 92717-3900.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Binding Sites, Antibody', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/*biosynthesis', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/immunology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Immunologic', 'Humans', 'Immune Sera/pharmacology', 'Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Lymphotoxin-alpha/immunology/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Molecular Weight', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/immunology/*physiology', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/immunology/metabolism/pharmacology']",1993/06/01 00:00,1993/06/01 00:01,['1993/06/01 00:00'],"['1993/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1993 Jun 1;150(11):5070-9.,"['0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Immune Sera)', '0 (Lymphotoxin-alpha)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '126547-89-5 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Continuous treatment of P388/R-84 cells with ADR and TBL for 24 h further lowered the 50% inhibitory dose from 3.5 to 0.07 microM, the resistance level being decreased from 233-fold in the absence of TBL to 4.7-fold in the presence of TBL as compared to the parental P388 cells.

N-[2-(Methylamino)ethyl]-5-isoquinolinesulphonamide (H-8) and N-(2-aminoethyl)-5-isoquinolinesulphonamide (H-9) did not reverse vinblastine resistance. N-[2-[N-[3-(4-Chlorophenyl)-2-propenyl]amino] ethyl]-5-isoquinolinesulphonamide (H-86) and N-[2-[N-[3-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-methyl-2-propenyl] amino]ethyl]-5-isoquinolinesulphonamide (H-87) caused accumulation of intracellular vinblastine and inhibition of vinblastine efflux from the cells and reversed the resistance. Addition of an aminoethyl group to the nitrogen atom of the sulphonamide group (W-66) or a formyl group at the terminal amino group (H-85) of H-86 reduced those activities. Conversion of the chlorophenyl group of H-87 to pyridinyl (H-31) or furanyl (H-34) markedly decreased activities against the drug resistance. The activity against vinblastine accumulation closely correlated with the apparent partition coefficient of compounds. These compounds dose-dependently inhibited photoaffinity labelling of a photosensitive analogue of vinblastine, N-(p-azido-(3-[125I)salicyl)-N'-beta-aminoethyl-vindesine ([125I]NASV), and there was a good correlation between inhibition of [125I]NASV-photolabelling and hydrophobicity. Although these isoquinolinesulphonamides inhibited protein kinase A with different magnitudes, this activity did not correlate with the effect on the drug resistance. These results indicate that isoquinolinesulphonamide compounds with a hydrophobic group interact with antitumour drugs on P-glycoprotein and reverse multidrug resistance without involvement of their activity on protein kinase A.","['Nakamura, S', 'Wakusawa, S', 'Tajima, K', 'Miyamoto, K', 'Hagiwara, M', 'Hidaka, H']","['Nakamura S', 'Wakusawa S', 'Tajima K', 'Miyamoto K', 'Hagiwara M', 'Hidaka H']","['Third Division, Hokuriku University, Kanazawa, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Pharm Pharmacol,The Journal of pharmacy and pharmacology,0376363,IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1', 'Animals', 'Carrier Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Division/*drug effects', 'Cell Membrane/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance', 'Immunoblotting', 'Isoquinolines/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia P388/pathology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Protein Kinase C/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors', 'Reserpine/pharmacology', 'Sulfonamides/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Verapamil/pharmacology', 'Vinblastine/metabolism/*pharmacology']",1993/04/01 00:00,1993/04/01 00:01,['1993/04/01 00:00'],"['1993/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.2042-7158.1993.tb05551.x [doi]'],ppublish,J Pharm Pharmacol. 1993 Apr;45(4):268-73. doi: 10.1111/j.2042-7158.1993.tb05551.x.,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Isoquinolines)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', '8B1QWR724A (Reserpine)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Antigen-independent T-cell activation may occur through the surface molecules CDw60, CD2, and CD28. We wished to determine whether these antigen-independent T-cell-activation pathways could be involved in proliferation of leukemic T cells from patients with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL). Whereas CDw60 was only expressed on 28% +/- 7% (mean +/- SEM) of blood T cells obtained from healthy control subjects (n = 4), CDw60 was expressed on 94% +/- 3% of blood T cells obtained from patients with CTCL (n = 4). Dual color immunofluorescence microscopy of the T-cell infiltrate in involved skin of these patients demonstrated that almost 100% of the T cells expressed CDw60. Not only did T cells in the patients with CTCL express CDw60, but triggering of the T cells with anti-CDw60 resulted in enhanced proliferation relative to anti-TCR/CD3 and mitogenic lectins. Other antigen-independent pathways also appeared highly active in the T cells from patients with CTCL because enhanced proliferation relative to anti-TCR/CD3 or mitogenic lectins was found when anti-CD2 or anti-CD28 plus phorbol ester was used as stimulant. Despite the brisk proliferation induced by anti-CDw60, anti-CD2, or anti-CD28, T cells from the patients did not produce detectable amounts of gamma-interferon. The inability to produce gamma-interferon correlates with our finding of absent (n = 3) or weak (n = 1) intercellular adhesion molecule-1 expression in the lesional keratinocytes in these patients. In conclusion, T cells of patients with CTCL demonstrate elevated expression of a T-cell-independent signaling molecule CDw60 and respond to antigen-independent activating signals.","['Hansen, E R', 'Vejlsgaard, G L', 'Cooper, K D', 'Heidenheim, M', 'Larsen, J K', 'Ho, V C', 'Ross, C W', 'Fox, D A', 'Thomsen, K', 'Baadsgaard, O']","['Hansen ER', 'Vejlsgaard GL', 'Cooper KD', 'Heidenheim M', 'Larsen JK', 'Ho VC', 'Ross CW', 'Fox DA', 'Thomsen K', 'Baadsgaard O']","['Department of Dermatology, Gentofte Hospital, University of Copenhagen, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,J Invest Dermatol,The Journal of investigative dermatology,0426720,IM,"['Aged', 'Antigens, CD/immunology', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/immunology', 'CD2 Antigens', 'CD28 Antigens', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/metabolism', 'Leukemia/*pathology', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/metabolism/*pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*immunology', 'Receptors, Immunologic/immunology', 'Skin Neoplasms/metabolism/*pathology', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism/*pathology']",1993/05/01 00:00,1993/05/01 00:01,['1993/05/01 00:00'],"['1993/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0022-202X(93)90012-7 [pii]', '10.1111/1523-1747.ep12472333 [doi]']",ppublish,J Invest Dermatol. 1993 May;100(5):667-73. doi: 10.1111/1523-1747.ep12472333.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (CD2 Antigens)', '0 (CD28 Antigens)', '0 (CDw60 antigen)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most of the patients with MDS had more than 15% PCNA-positive cells (23.5% +/- 1.5%) while patients with no hematologic disorder showed fewer than 15% PCNA-positive cells (11.7% +/- 0.7%). The overall ratio of the PCNA-positive cell fraction in the bone marrow was considered of prognostic value for predicting transition into overt leukemia from MDS. Aplastic anemia cases usually exhibited hypocellular bone marrow and an infrequent labeling with the anti-PCNA antibody (3.3% +/- 0.5%). However, a few aplastic anemia cases showed hypercellular bone marrow and a significantly high PCNA-positive cell ratio (32.0% +/- 4.4%). In the bone marrow of acute myeloid leukemia patients more than 20% of total nucleated cells were positive for PCNA (30.0% +/- 2.2%). The results suggest that the expression of PCNA is associated with the regulation of bone marrow cell proliferation and the bone marrow cellularity, and that these findings would serve as an early indicator of evolution of overt leukemia in MDS and also would be useful in distinguishing MDS cases from aplastic anemia cases when the bone marrow is hypocellular or normocellular.","['Kitagawa, M', 'Kamiyama, R', 'Kasuga, T']","['Kitagawa M', 'Kamiyama R', 'Kasuga T']","['Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Hum Pathol,Human pathology,9421547,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Anemia, Aplastic/*metabolism/pathology', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow/*metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/metabolism/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*metabolism/pathology', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen']",1993/04/01 00:00,1993/04/01 00:01,['1993/04/01 00:00'],"['1993/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0046-8177(93)90082-R [pii]', '10.1016/0046-8177(93)90082-r [doi]']",ppublish,Hum Pathol. 1993 Apr;24(4):359-63. doi: 10.1016/0046-8177(93)90082-r.,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: We did not find any increase in mdr-1-specific mRNA, while small amounts of P170 were easily detectable in about two thirds of the lymphocytes and monocytes and in about one third of the granulocytes. The level of P170 expression in leukocytes was similar to that found in non-MDR tumor cell lines. CONCLUSIONS: mdr-1 is constitutively expressed in human normal leukocytes at levels that cannot significantly affect drug resistance.

Taxol acts as a mitotic inhibitor, blocking cells in the G2M-phase of the cell cycle. The differential radiation sensitivity of cells in various phases of the cell cycle has been well recognized. This study was focused on the possible interaction between radiation and a microtubular inhibitor, taxol, in regard to its ability to synchronize cells at the G2M-phase of cell cycle and, thereby, enhance the radiation sensitivity of the cells. METHODS: HL-60 cells were exposed to 3 x 10(-8) M concentrations of taxol for 1 hour at 37 degrees C followed by reculturing for 24 hours in drug-free medium. The cells were then seeded into 60-mm diameter plastic dishes at appropriate cell concentrations to estimate their colony-forming efficiency. The radiation dose ranged from 0-400 cGy and was delivered in a single fraction. The cellular survival after treatment with the drug and/or radiation was determined using a soft agar clonogenic assay. RESULTS: When HL-60 cells were treated with taxol, up to 70% of the cells were blocked in G2M-phase, as determined by flow cytometric analysis. At the low cytotoxic dose of 3 X 10(-8) M, the sensitizing enhancement ratio was 1.48. CONCLUSIONS: It appears that taxol has a radiation-sensitizing effect on HL-60 cells and deserves further investigation with other cell lines.","['Choy, H', 'Rodriguez, F F', 'Koester, S', 'Hilsenbeck, S', 'Von Hoff, D D']","['Choy H', 'Rodriguez FF', 'Koester S', 'Hilsenbeck S', 'Von Hoff DD']","['Department of Radiology, University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['Cell Survival/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'G2 Phase/*drug effects/radiation effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*pathology/radiotherapy', 'Paclitaxel/*pharmacology', 'Radiation-Sensitizing Agents/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/06/01 00:00,1993/06/01 00:01,['1993/06/01 00:00'],"['1993/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19930601)71:11<3774::aid-cncr2820711147>3.0.co;2-0 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1993 Jun 1;71(11):3774-8. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19930601)71:11<3774::aid-cncr2820711147>3.0.co;2-0.,"['0 (Radiation-Sensitizing Agents)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The D-isomer of VRP (D-VRP) is 10 times less active than the racemic mixture on the cardiovascular system, but retains a MDR modulating activity. Daunorubicin (DNR) and doxorubicin (DX) are two anthracyclines whose cytotoxicity is strongly related with the expression of P170, while their respective lipophylic derivatives idarubicin (IDA) and iododoxorubicin (IDX) are less P170-dependent. We studied the effect of D-VRP on intracellular retention and on the cytotoxicity of these four anthracyclines in two MDR cell systems (LOVO and CEM) by flow cytometry and by a microcultured tetrazolium colorimetric assay (MTT). We found that in MDR cells D-VRP increased intracellular anthracycline concentration and increased the cytotoxicity of DNR, IDA and DX but not of IDX. The effect of D-VRP was dose-related, but it was already consistent at D-VRP concentrations that can be readily maintained in vivo (2-3 microM).

One mechanism implicated in resistance to cytodestructive drugs is overexpression of P-glycoprotein, the MDR1 gene product. While several classes of drugs sensitize multidrug-resistant (MDR) cells by interfering with the function of P-glycoprotein in vitro, few sensitizers have been effective in vivo. We have developed a preclinical model of MDR/CML uncomplicated by other mechanisms of drug resistance to evaluate the effects of MDR1 overexpression on cytodestructive and differentiation therapy and the ability of sensitizers to restore chemosensitivity in this disease. The CML-derived cell line K562 was transfected with a human MDR1 cDNA from the pHaMDR1/A expression vector and selected with vinblastine. Resistant K562 clones were 20-30-fold resistant to vinblastine, were cross-resistant to doxorubicin and etoposide, and remained sensitive to cytosine arabinoside, 6-thioguanine, hydroxyurea, and mechlorethamine. Resistance was associated with decreased cellular accumulation of cytotoxic drug and was reversed by cyclosporin A and trans-flupenthixol. The MDR phenotype did not adversely affect the ability of K562 cells to produce fetal hemoglobin in response to hemin, and was associated with increased responsiveness of cells to differentiate with cytosine arabinoside. Upon differentiation, the resistant clones increased MDR1 mRNA and P-glycoprotein. These studies suggest that the overexpression of the MDR1 gene in CML may not adversely affect the ability to undergo erythroid differentiation and that these resistant K562 cell lines are good models for studying drug resistance mediated by P-glycoprotein in CML.","['Hait, W N', 'Choudhury, S', 'Srimatkandada, S', 'Murren, J R']","['Hait WN', 'Choudhury S', 'Srimatkandada S', 'Murren JR']","['Yale University School of Medicine, Department of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut 06510.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cyclosporine/*pharmacology', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'DNA/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Drug Resistance/*genetics', 'Flupenthixol/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Hemin/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vinblastine/*pharmacology']",1993/05/01 00:00,1993/05/01 00:01,['1993/05/01 00:00'],"['1993/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1172/JCI116447 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1993 May;91(5):2207-15. doi: 10.1172/JCI116447.,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', '743LRP9S7N (Hemin)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'FA0UYH6QUO (Flupenthixol)']",,,,"['CA 08341/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 43888/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['MDR1'],,,PMC288223,,,,,,,,,,

In a recent phase I/II trial in patients with end-stage leukemia, tiazofurin showed good response; however, repeated treatment resulted in clinical resistance to the drug. To elucidate the mechanisms of resistance in human leukemic cells, two variants of human myelogenous leukemia K652 cells resistant to tiazofurin were developed by drug-selection pressure. Compared to a concentration producing 50% cell proliferation reduction that was 9.1 microM in sensitive cells, the resistant variants displayed concentrations producing 50% cell proliferation reductions of 12 and 16 mM. The activity of the target enzyme, IMP dehydrogenase, was not altered in the resistant cells. Studies on tiazofurin metabolism revealed that resistant variants formed < 10% of the active metabolite, thiazole-4-carboxamide adenine dinucleotide. This correlated with the activity of NAD pyrophosphorylase, the enzyme that synthesizes thiazole-4-carboxamide adenine dinucleotide, which was reduced to 10% in the resistant lines. Concurrently, the activity of thiazole-4-carboxamide adenine dinucleotide phosphodiesterase was elevated in the refractory cells. Compared to the sensitive counterpart, the levels of GMP and NAD were lower in the resistant lines. Guanine salvage activity was decreased in the resistant cells. Basal dGTP and dATP concentrations were elevated in the resistant line; nevertheless, tiazofurin incubation decreased dGTP levels in only the sensitive cells. Although there was no difference in the Km of tiazofurin transport or efflux, the Vmax of uptake of the drug was reduced in the resistant lines.

Over a three-year period, 61 consecutive patients from a single institution undergoing allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) for various hematological diseases were grafted with unmanipulated marrow and followed for the development of hematopoietic chimerism. Three synthetic oligonucleotide probes homologous to the so-called minisatellite or variable number of tandem repeat (VNTR) sequences were evaluated in the clinical setting of BMT for their usefulness: (i) to document marrow engraftment or rejection; (ii) to elucidate the kinetics of mixed chimerism; and (iii) in providing a sensitive tool for early detection of relapse. In addition, in patients with CML karyotyping and analysis of bcr/abl gene rearrangement was performed. Using this panel of three oligonucleotide probes, informative markers specific for donor or recipient RFLP could be demonstrated in all cases. Engraftment could be documented in all patients surviving beyond day +14 after BMT. Mixed chimerism was detected in 14% of the patients in the early phase (day +14 to day +78) after BMT but only one patient turned out to become a long-term stable mixed chimera. These results support the hypothesis that lymphocytes of recipient origin surviving the conditioning regimen may considerably contribute to mixed chimerism early after BMT. Long-term stable mixed chimerism is a rare event after BMT with unmanipulated marrow. Simultaneous analysis of chimerism after BMT by VNTR-RFLP, karyotyping, and detection of bcr/abl rearrangement in patients with CML showed corresponding results in nine out of 12 patients. In three patients either one of the methods failed to detect residual recipient cells in the early phase after BMT. Therefore different methods for assessment of mixed chimerism seem to complement rather than to exclude each other. Eleven patients who all exhibited complete chimerism early after BMT relapsed from their underlying disease. In seven of these patients grafted for acute leukemia, analysis of DNA-RFLP had been performed shortly before clinical relapse (30-86 days) and failed to herald relapse. As the sensitivity for the detection of the minor cell population by analysis of DNA-RFLPs is approximately 1%, these data may indicate that relapse of acute leukemia after BMT is characterized by a sudden increase in the percentage of recipient blast cells not detectable even by frequent RFLP analyses.","['Suttorp, M', 'Schmitz, N', 'Dreger, P', 'Schaub, J', 'Loffler, H']","['Suttorp M', 'Schmitz N', 'Dreger P', 'Schaub J', 'Loffler H']","['Second Department of Internal Medicine, University of Kiel, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anemia/diagnosis/*therapy', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chimera', 'Evaluation Studies as Topic', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/diagnosis/*therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Translocation, Genetic']",1993/05/01 00:00,1993/05/01 00:01,['1993/05/01 00:00'],"['1993/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1993 May;7(5):679-87.,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The most widely studied drug is fludarabine which is able to obtain complete or partial responses in more than 50% of previously treated patients. The response rate is 44% for 2-CDA and approximately 25% for pentostatin. Fludarabine has also been used to treat patients as initial therapy, and has resulted in overall response rate of 79% with 75% of the patients achieving complete remission. The NCI and International Working Group for CLL criteria for complete remission allow for persistent nodules or lymphoid infiltrates in the bone marrow biopsy. Studies have now demonstrated persistent lymphoid aggregates are associated with a shorter time to progression for responders but no survival disadvantage. There is a strong association of documented refractoriness to alkylating agents with probability of response to fludarabine and also survival. The major morbidity associated with the use of these drugs are infections, which, in some circumstances, are associated with neutropenia but in other circumstances are probably related to the hypogammaglobulinemia and T-cell immunodeficiency which are part of the disease. The T-cell immunodeficiency is aggravated by the nucleoside analogs. Even after discontinuation of therapy the immunodeficiency as measured by CD4 cell number is sustained for 12 to 24 months. Opportunistic organisms such as herpes simplex, herpes zoster, Listeria monocytogenes, and pneumocystis carinii are being noted in patients treated with these agents. The potency of these drugs and low incidence of toxicities to other organs suggests that they will be effectively combined with other agents.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Keating, M J', ""O'Brien, S"", 'Kantarjian, H', 'Robertson, L B', 'Koller, C', 'Beran, M', 'Estey, E']","['Keating MJ', ""O'Brien S"", 'Kantarjian H', 'Robertson LB', 'Koller C', 'Beran M', 'Estey E']","['Department of Hematology, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Medical Center, Houston 77030.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Cladribine/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Pentostatin/*therapeutic use', 'Survival Rate', 'Vidarabine/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199309149126 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1993;10 Suppl:139-45. doi: 10.3109/10428199309149126.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '395575MZO7 (Pentostatin)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",,28,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Immunophenotypes were obtained in all cases and karyotypes were analyzed in 37 cases. Detection with JSB1 or with C219 led to similar results in terms of positive cells and cases, but the intensity of staining was higher with JSB1. In the populations studied, the rate of first complete remission differed between MDR-positive and MDR-negative in adult patients only (56% v 93%, respectively, P = .05). Of the 16 MDR-positive patients who had presented a first complete remission, 13 (81%) relapsed, compared with 13 of 35 (37%) MDR-negative (P = .008) patients. A higher rate of relapse among MDR-positive compared with MDR-negative patients was observed in adults and in children taken separately (adults 100% v 46%; children 73% v 32%, respectively). The survival rates (Kaplan-Meier method) were significantly higher in MDR-negative compared with MDR-positive populations as a whole (P = .002) and among children (P = .05) and adults (P = .03) taken separately. Event-free survival curves followed this trend. The percentage of second complete remission was very low in the MDR-positive group (15%) compared with 38% for the MDR-negative group. These results were shown by multivariate analysis to be independent of age, immunophenotypes, and karyotypes and clearly show the importance of MDR phenotype detection in ALL.","['Goasguen, J E', 'Dossot, J M', 'Fardel, O', 'Le Mee, F', 'Le Gall, E', 'Leblay, R', 'LePrise, P Y', 'Chaperon, J', 'Fauchet, R']","['Goasguen JE', 'Dossot JM', 'Fardel O', 'Le Mee F', 'Le Gall E', 'Leblay R', 'LePrise PY', 'Chaperon J', 'Fauchet R']","['Universite de Rennes, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/genetics/immunology/mortality/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug Resistance/*genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Karyotyping', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/analysis/*genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/analysis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/immunology/mortality/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Analysis', 'Time Factors']",1993/05/01 00:00,1993/05/01 00:01,['1993/05/01 00:00'],"['1993/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)72842-9 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1993 May 1;81(9):2394-8.,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)']","['Blood. 1993 Dec 1;82(11):3505-7.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We treated 18 CLL patients with about-monthly courses of five daily 2-hour intravenous infusions of 0.12 mg CdA/kg. RESULTS: Complete remissions (CRs) were achieved in seven patients (39%), with a total response rate of 67%. CR patients received a median of 4.5 courses. One patient with CR relapsed and died 14 months from start of CdA treatment, whereas the other six patients with CR remain in remission following a mean observation period of 14 months. The median duration of partial remissions (PRs) was 9 months, with a median treatment-free interval of 15 months. Thrombocytopenia was the most common dose-limiting toxicity. Non-responding patients had a median survival of 3.5 months, and systemic fungal infections were the most common cause of death. Immunoglobulin (Ig) levels improved significantly in hypogammaglobulinemic patients during CdA treatment. Responses were predicted by a rapid decrease of blood lymphocyte counts following the first treatment course. CONCLUSION: A high CR rate was achieved with limited toxicity.

For activation, the cells were exposed to anti-TcR/CD3, anti-CD2 and anti-major histocompatibility complex (anti-MHC) class I monoclonal antibodies (mAb) respectively. Cellular activation by these mAb leading to an increased IL-2 secretion was preceded by a rise in [Ca2+]i and was relatively dependent on the expression of the a TcR/CD3 complex. In contrast, anti-MHC class I mAb-induced clonal abortion in Jurkat T cells may occur without previous fluctuations in [Ca2+]i and appeared to be independent of TcR/CD3 expression. The present observation suggest the existence of different secondary messenger systems operating in Jurkat cells following activation via the TcR/CD3, CD2 and the MHC class I pathways, respectively.","['Claesson, M H', 'Dissing, S', 'Tscherning, T', 'Geisler, C']","['Claesson MH', 'Dissing S', 'Tscherning T', 'Geisler C']","['Laboratory of Experimental Immunology, Panum Institute, University of Copenhagen, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Immunology,Immunology,0374672,IM,"['Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/analysis', 'CD2 Antigens', 'CD3 Complex/analysis', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/metabolism', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/*immunology', 'Mutation', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Receptors, Immunologic/analysis', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/immunology']",1993/03/01 00:00,1993/03/01 00:01,['1993/03/01 00:00'],"['1993/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Immunology. 1993 Mar;78(3):444-8.,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (CD2 Antigens)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,,,,,,,PMC1421850,,,,,,,,,,

The oligonucleotide inhibited the formation of colony-forming unit erythroid-derived colonies but did not affect the size or degree of hemoglobinization.

Homotypic adhesion involves mainly the interaction between the adhesion molecules Leukocyte Function Antigen-1 (LFA-1) and its ligand CD54 (ICAM-1). A well-characterized B-chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (B-CLL) clone (I-83) was used as a source of monoclonal B cells inducible to DNA synthesis and differentiation by using 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA) in combination with interleukin-4 (IL-4) and thioredoxin (Trx)-containing supernatant from a T-cell hybridoma (BSF-MP6). This paper shows that IL-4 alone was able to induce aggregation of B-CLL cells and to strongly enhance TPA+BSF-MP6-induced aggregation. The results from studying the expression of CD11a and CD18, the two subunits of LFA-1, and CD54 during stimulated DNA synthesis and differentiation suggest that IL-4-induced, or enhanced, aggregation was mainly mediated by a selective up-regulation of CD54.

At the time of relapse many patients manifest resistance to a wide array of structurally unrelated antineoplastic agents, hence the term multidrug resistance (MDR). Other tumor types, such as those arising in the colon, kidneys, liver, and lungs, tend to exhibit poor response to available cytotoxic drugs. The MDR phenomenon includes cross-resistance among the anthracyclines (doxorubicin, daunorubicin), the epipodophyllotoxins (etoposide, teniposide), the vinca alkaloids (vinblastine, vincristine), taxol, and other compounds. In vitro studies in cell culture indicate that this form of resistance is associated with amplification or overexpression of the mdr1 gene. The mdr1 gene codes for the expression of a cell surface protein, P-glycoprotein (P-gp), which acts as an energy-dependent efflux pump that transports drugs associated with MDR out of the cell before cytotoxic effects occur. The protein is expressed in normal human tissues such as the gastrointestinal tract, liver, and kidneys, where it is thought to serve as an excretory pathway for xenobiotic drugs and toxins. Preliminary studies demonstrated the presence of P-gp in tumor samples from patients with acute leukemia, multiple myeloma, lymphomas, and a variety of solid tumors. A number of drugs are able to reverse MDR, including calcium-channel blockers, phenothiazines, quinidine, antimalarial agents, antiestrogenic and other steroids, and cyclosporine. Limited results from clinical trials with small numbers of patients suggest that the addition of verapamil, diltiazem, quinine, trifluoperazine, or cyclosporine to chemotherapeutic regimens has the potential to reverse MDR; however, toxicities limit their clinical usefulness. A number of trials are under way to identify more active and less toxic modulators of MDR.","['Lum, B L', 'Gosland, M P', 'Kaubisch, S', 'Sikic, B I']","['Lum BL', 'Gosland MP', 'Kaubisch S', 'Sikic BI']","['Department of Clinical Pharmacy, University of the Pacific School of Pharmacy, Palo Alto, California.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Pharmacotherapy,Pharmacotherapy,8111305,IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacokinetics', 'Drug Resistance/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/genetics']",1993/03/01 00:00,1993/03/01 00:01,['1993/03/01 00:00'],"['1993/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Pharmacotherapy. 1993 Mar-Apr;13(2):88-109.,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)']",,212,,"['MO1 RR 00070/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA 52168/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The increase in MDR1 expression in tumors after chemotherapy is usually attributed to selection of pre-existing multidrug-resistant cells by Pgp-transported drugs. MDR1 expression in tissue culture can be increased by several types of stress-inducing treatment, including agents that activate protein kinase C (PKC). Previous studies, however, failed to demonstrate that short-term exposure to any chemotherapeutic drug can induce the expression of the resident MDR1 gene in drug-sensitive human cells. PURPOSE: This study was designed to utilize highly sensitive assays to determine if transient exposure to chemotherapeutic drugs would have an effect on MDR1 expression in human cells and to assess if PKC inhibitors would influence such an effect. METHODS: We analyzed the MDR1 gene expression in several human cell lines derived from leukemias or solid tumors, after treatment with different cytotoxic drugs, in the presence or absence of PKC inhibitors. Pgp function and expression were studied by flow cytometric assays, and MDR1 messenger RNA (mRNA) was assayed by polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Transient exposure to chemotherapeutic drugs, including agents that are not transported by Pgp, induced Pgp and MDR1 mRNA expression in subpopulations of treated cells in most of the tested cell lines. This induction was observed along with microscopically detectable cell damage. The drug-induced MDR1 expression and the associated twofold to threefold increase in resistance to vinblastine were sustained in K562 leukemia cells for at least several weeks after the removal of the drug. Drug-mediated MDR1 induction was blocked by nonspecific protein kinase inhibitors that are active against PKC, but not by a protein kinase inhibitor ineffective against PKC. CONCLUSIONS: Expression of the human MDR1 mRNA and Pgp can be induced in response to cellular damage by cytotoxic drugs regardless of whether the drugs are transported by Pgp. This induction can be prevented by protein kinase inhibitors. IMPLICATIONS: Induction of MDR1 expression in response to cellular damage may account for increased MDR1 expression in treated human tumors. Protein kinase inhibitors may be useful in preventing the emergence of multidrug resistance during cancer chemotherapy.","['Chaudhary, P M', 'Roninson, I B']","['Chaudhary PM', 'Roninson IB']","['Department of Genetics, University of Illinois, Chicago 60612.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance/genetics', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*drug effects/genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*drug effects/genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Protein Kinase C/antagonists & inhibitors', 'RNA, Messenger/drug effects', 'RNA, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/04/21 00:00,1993/04/21 00:01,['1993/04/21 00:00'],"['1993/04/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/04/21 00:01 [medline]', '1993/04/21 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/jnci/85.8.632 [doi]'],ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1993 Apr 21;85(8):632-9. doi: 10.1093/jnci/85.8.632.,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)']",,,,['R01CA-40333/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['MDR1'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Alteration of early protein tyrosine phosphorylation and of the mechanism responsible for cell calcium influx.,3624-33,"To study defective signal transduction via the Ag receptor of B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells (B-CLL), we examine in this report the Ca2+ response triggered by anti-mu antibody in 23 patients previously classified in three phenotypic groups. Altered Ca2+ changes are essentially found in CLL group II whose leukemic cells are characterized by a marked expression of the CD11b Ag. B-CLL cells from patients with a defective Ca2+ response present an altered pattern of protein tyrosine phosphorylation after anti-mu stimulation in comparison with normal human B cells and B-CLL cells from patients having a normal Ca2+ response. Most of the proteins usually tyrosine phosphorylated after the triggering of cell-surface IgM are concerned. This includes the gamma 1 isoform of phospholipase C, although the protein is normally present in B-CLL cells. These findings suggest that the interruption of the phosphoinositide pathway in B-CLL cells is very proximal, at the level in the signaling cascade between activated surface Ig receptors and protein tyrosine kinases. Simultaneously, we demonstrate that some low responding patients exhibit a decreased Ca2+ response to thapsigargin, an agent known to release intracellular Ca2+ without inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate production. This suggests that an altered functioning of the mechanism leading to the cell Ca2+ influx in B cells can be also involved in the decreased Ca2+ response observed in B-CLL cells.","['Michel, F', 'Merle-Beral, H', 'Legac, E', 'Michel, A', 'Debre, P', 'Bismuth, G']","['Michel F', 'Merle-Beral H', 'Legac E', 'Michel A', 'Debre P', 'Bismuth G']","[""Laboratoire d'Immunologie Cellulaire et Tissulaire, CNRS UA 625, CH Pitie-Salpetriere, CERVI, Paris, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic/immunology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Antigens, CD/physiology', 'CD11 Antigens', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin M/immunology/physiology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/immunology/*metabolism', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proteins/*metabolism', 'Rabbits', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/physiology', 'Terpenes/pharmacology', 'Thapsigargin', 'Tyrosine/*metabolism']",1993/04/15 00:00,1993/04/15 00:01,['1993/04/15 00:00'],"['1993/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1993 Apr 15;150(8 Pt 1):3624-33.,"['0 (Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD11 Antigens)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '0 (Terpenes)', '0 (anti-IgM)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', '67526-95-8 (Thapsigargin)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

LIF was detected in 11/20 sera from patients with giant cell arteritis (GCA), a vasculitis syndrome affecting particularly the temporal artery, characterized by panarteritis with inflammatory cell infiltration. LIF levels were considerably elevated in some patients who also displayed elevated levels of IL-6 and C-reactive protein (CRP); however, no correlation was observed between the levels of circulating LIF and levels of IL-6 or CRP. Furthermore, LIF levels were not affected by corticosteroid therapy, whereas IL-6 and CRP decreased rapidly, as clinical symptoms resolved. A putative role for LIF in the persistence of histological lesions is discussed. This is the first report of the presence of circulating LIF in sera.

Prognostic significance in acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia.",2739-45,"BACKGROUND: The proliferative characteristics of acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia (ANLL) were studied in vivo, and data were correlated with response to chemotherapy and survival. METHODS: Sixty-five patients with untreated ANLL and 15 patients with solid tumors and normal bone marrow (BM) received 250 mg/m2 of bromodeoxyuridine (BUdR); bivariate flow cytometric (FCM) analysis then was used to measure cell BUdR incorporation and DNA content to obtain a complete set of kinetic parameters (i.e., BM BUdR-labeling index, DNA-synthesis time, potential doubling time [Tpot], and cell production rate). The percentage of blasts with positive results for proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) also was obtained by FCM analysis on the same BM samples, and these kinetic parameters were derived specifically for the ANLL proliferating compartment (growth fraction). Induction therapy, consisting of vincristine, arabinosylcytosine, and daunomycin, was administered subsequently to the patients with ANLL. RESULTS: Overall ANLL proliferative activity was lower than normal myelopoiesis, and a short Tpot was found to be a favorable factor for achieving complete remission (CR), the duration of CR, and survival. When the growth fraction was considered, however, ANLL proliferative activity was higher and more like that of normal BM.

The HEX gene is present as a single copy in the human genome. Analysis of murine genomic DNA shows, in addition to an intron-containing gene homologous to HEX, the presence of a processed copy of the gene which has arisen within the last few million years. Analysis of human and murine haematopoietic cells and cell lines, revealed expression of the HEX gene in multipotential progenitors, as well as cells of the B-lymphocyte and myeloid lineages.

KW-2149 was also effective in inhibiting the growth of MMC-resistant P388 (P388/MMC) cells. To elucidate these characteristics of KW-2149, its uptake and efflux were compared with those of MMC in MMC-sensitive and -resistant P388 cells. Both MMC and KW-2149 accumulated rapidly in P388 cells after incubation at the concentration of 0.47 and 0.024 microM, respectively, which were the IC50 values at 1-h exposure. Although this concentration of KW-2149 was 20 times lower than that of MMC, its intracellular concentration was little more than that of MMC, suggesting that KW-2149 accumulated in the cells quite efficiently. The accumulated KW-2149 in the cells after 1-h treatment remained for as long as 24 h after the incubation of the cells in drug-free medium, suggesting that most of the intracellular KW-2149 or MMC was bound to cellular components. The ratios of resistance of P388/MMC cells to MMC and KW-2149 were 34 and 8.8, respectively, at 1-h exposure, suggesting that P388/MMC cells were partially resistant to KW-2149 in vitro. P388/MMC cells also showed partial resistance to cisplatin, Adriamycin, m-AMSA, and etoposide. The accumulation of MMC in P388/MMC cells was lower than that in P388 cells, although the size of the former cells was almost equal to that of the latter. As a result, the amount of DNA-bound MMC was lower in P388/MMC cells than in P388 cells, suggesting its involvement in the mechanisms of MMC resistance in P388/MMC cells.","['Kobayashi, E', 'Okabe, M', 'Kono, M', 'Arai, H', 'Kasai, M', 'Gomi, K', 'Lee, J H', 'Inaba, M', 'Tsuruo, T']","['Kobayashi E', 'Okabe M', 'Kono M', 'Arai H', 'Kasai M', 'Gomi K', 'Lee JH', 'Inaba M', 'Tsuruo T']","['Pharmaceutical Research Laboratories, Kyowa Hakko Kogyo Co., Ltd., Shimotogari, Shizuoka-ken, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1', 'Animals', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance', 'Leukemia P388/*metabolism', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mitomycin/*metabolism', '*Mitomycins', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00685871 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 1993;32(1):20-4. doi: 10.1007/BF00685871.,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Mitomycins)', '118359-59-4 (KW 2149)', '50SG953SK6 (Mitomycin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent reports of constitutive IL-6 production from spontaneously proliferating cells from human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV)-infected individuals led us to examine the expression of IL-6 and LIF during HTLV infection. In vitro infection of peripheral blood lymphocytes with HTLV-I was associated with production of both soluble LIF and IL-6 in conjunction with the increasing HTLV antigen concentration. Northern blot analysis of T-cell lines generated from individuals infected with HTLV-I (MT-2, HuT-102, FS, EG, SP) and HTLV-II (Mo-T, H2A, H2E) demonstrated a marked increase in constitutive expression of LIF and IL-6 transcripts, as compared with uninfected cell lines (HuT-78, Jurkat). The constitutive expression of LIF and IL-6 was independent of presence of IL-2 in the culture medium, as both IL-2-independent (MT-2, HuT-102, SP, Mo-T) and IL-2-dependent (FS, EG, H2A, H2E) cell lines expressed LIF and IL-6 transcripts. Furthermore, LIF and IL-6 RNA expression in an HTLV-I-infected cell line (MT-2) was enhanced by phorbol ester stimulation via mechanisms that appear to be dependent on the posttranscriptional regulatory controls. These results show that both LIF and IL-6 are produced by HTLV-I- and HTLV-II-infected cells, which could potentially alter the transcriptional regulation of HTLV gene expression by inducing certain early response genes.","['Lal, R B', 'Rudolph, D', 'Buckner, C', 'Pardi, D', 'Hooper, W C']","['Lal RB', 'Rudolph D', 'Buckner C', 'Pardi D', 'Hooper WC']","['Retrovirus Diseases Branch, National Center for Infectious Diseases, Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta, GA 30333.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Cell Line', 'Deltaretrovirus Infections/blood/*metabolism', 'Growth Inhibitors/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'HTLV-I Infections/metabolism', 'HTLV-II Infections/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/biosynthesis/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology']",1993/04/01 00:00,1993/04/01 00:01,['1993/04/01 00:00'],"['1993/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)79192-5 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1993 Apr 1;81(7):1827-32.,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Interferons (IFNs), especially of the alpha (alpha) subtype, have shown a significant antitumor effect in HCL patients. However, the therapeutic effect of IFN-alpha is still rather limited. The purine analogue 2-chlorodeoxy-adenosine (2-CdA) was reported recently to be an effective agent in the treatment of HCL. In the present study, we find that the HCL cell lines HS-1 and HS-2 as well as Eskol and its IFN-resistant clone (IREs-4) are sensitive to the cytotoxic activity of 2-CdA. Combination treatment of IFN-Con1 and 2-CdA results in a synergistic effect at low doses but an additive inhibitory effect at higher concentrations. IREs-4 cells responded only to 2-CdA treatment. All the HCL cell lines are resistant to natural killer (NK) cell-mediated cytotoxicity (CMC) but are relatively sensitive to IFN-Con1-primed or interleukin-2 (IL-2)-primed NK-CMC activities. No inhibition in killing ability was measured when only the effector cells (NK) were treated with 2-CdA. Pretreatment of the HCL target cells with 2-CdA increases their susceptibility to NK-CMC. Pretreatment with IFN-Con1 can reduce the susceptibility of target cells to NK-CMC in HS-1, HS-2, and Eskol cells but not in the IFN-resistant clone IREs-4. 2-CdA abolished this IFN-induced protection against NK-CMC. Normal fibroblasts only responded to treatment with relatively high doses of 2-CdA, and only a moderate additive cell growth inhibitory effect was seen in combination of 2-CdA with IFN-Con1. Only high doses of 2-CdA increased the susceptibility of fibroblast culture to NK-CMC. Thus, combination of IFN-Con1 and 2-CdA results in an in vitro enhancement of the direct antiproliferative/cytotoxic activity of each treatment alone and increases the efficacy of the NK activity against the HCL cell lines.","['Reiter, Z', 'Tomson, S', 'Ozes, O N', 'Taylor, M W']","['Reiter Z', 'Tomson S', 'Ozes ON', 'Taylor MW']","['Division of Morphological Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, Technion, Haifa, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cladribine/*pharmacology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Cellular/drug effects', 'Interferon Type I/*pharmacology', 'Interferon-alpha', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*drug effects/immunology', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/immunology/*pathology/therapy', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', 'Major Histocompatibility Complex/*immunology', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/04/01 00:00,1993/04/01 00:01,['1993/04/01 00:00'],"['1993/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)79177-9 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1993 Apr 1;81(7):1699-708.,"['0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)', '56588OP40D (interferon alfacon-1)']",,,,['CA53783/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For all cancers other than lung cancer the number of deaths observed was slightly greater than that expected from national rates, but the increase was not significant statistically (ratio of observed to expected deaths [O/E] = 1.11, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.98-1.24) and mortality did not increase with duration of employment underground or with cumulative exposure to radon. Non-lung cancer mortality was significantly raised among men who started mining work aged under 25 but the increase was not related to cumulative radon exposure. When twenty-eight individual sites and types of cancer were examined, significantly increased risks were found for cancers of the liver (O/E = 1.67) and gallbladder and extrahepatic bile ducts (O/E = 2.26). For liver cancer, mortality did not increase with duration of employment underground or with cumulative radon exposure. For cancer of the gallbladder and extrahepatic bile ducts, mortality did not increase with duration of employment, but increased with cumulative exposure to radon. Mortality from multiple myeloma, although not significantly increased overall (O/E = 1.08), increased with cumulative exposure to radon. Mortality from leukaemia was not increased overall (O/E = 0.91) and was not related to cumulative radon exposure, but did increase with increasing duration of employment in the mines. There is no evidence in these miners that a radon-rich atmosphere increases the risk of any cancer other than lung cancer. Possible exceptions are cancer of the gallbladder and extrahepatic bile ducts and multiple myeloma but further study is needed before it can be concluded that the associations found are causal.","['Tomasek, L', 'Darby, S C', 'Swerdlow, A J', 'Placek, V', 'Kunz, E']","['Tomasek L', 'Darby SC', 'Swerdlow AJ', 'Placek V', 'Kunz E']","['National Institute for Public Health, Prague, Czech, Republic.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Lancet,"Lancet (London, England)",2985213R,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Air Pollutants, Radioactive', 'Cause of Death', 'Czechoslovakia/epidemiology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Linear Models', 'Lung Neoplasms/complications/epidemiology/etiology', 'Male', 'Maximum Allowable Concentration', 'Middle Aged', '*Mining', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/etiology', 'Occupational Diseases/complications/etiology/*mortality', 'Occupational Exposure', 'Radon/*adverse effects/analysis', 'Risk Factors', 'Time Factors', '*Uranium']",1993/04/10 00:00,1993/04/10 00:01,['1993/04/10 00:00'],"['1993/04/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/04/10 00:01 [medline]', '1993/04/10 00:00 [entrez]']","['0140-6736(93)91212-5 [pii]', '10.1016/0140-6736(93)91212-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Lancet. 1993 Apr 10;341(8850):919-23. doi: 10.1016/0140-6736(93)91212-5.,"['0 (Air Pollutants, Radioactive)', '4OC371KSTK (Uranium)', 'Q74S4N8N1G (Radon)']",['Lancet. 1993 Jul 3;342(8862):47.

The chromosomal location of this related gene, GGTLA1, has been determined by both isotopic and fluorescence in situ hybridization to metaphase cells and by Southern blot analysis of somatic cell hybrid DNAs. We show that GGTLA1 is part of a distinct gene family, which has at least four members (GGTLA1, GGTLA2, GGTLA3, GGTLA4). At least two loci are located on chromosome 22 within band q11 and proximal to the chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) breakpoint in BCR (breakpoint cluster region gene). At least one other member is located more distally between the breakpoints found in Ewings sarcoma and CML.

Murine leukemic P388 and doxorubicin-resistant P388/R84 lines were used as controls. The 50% growth-inhibitory concentration (IC50) for doxorubicin among lung-tumor lines varied from 0.16 to 0.31 microM in soft agar. Heterogeneity in doxorubicin or daunorubicin retention and response to the efflux-blocking action of 25 microM prochlorperazine was noted in pleural effusion of FCCL-1, -4, and -8. Among the cell lines established, an efflux-blocking effect in a subpopulation was noticed only in FCCL-1 and -4. Although the MDR-1 gene was present in all cell lines, including P388, its expression was pronounced only in P388/R84 and FCCL-1. In situ hybridization of antisense RNA probe to tumor cells showed high heterogeneity for MDR-1 message in the human lung-tumor cells as compared with the murine cells. Northern and slot blot hybridization confirmed in situ hybridization in lines with high levels of MDR-1 expression. The synthesis of MDR-1 mRNA and P-glycoprotein in tumor lines was correlated. The results suggest that because of extensive tumor-cell heterogeneity in human tumors, monitoring of MDR expression by in situ hybridization, quantitation of P-glycoprotein content by laser flow cytometry (and/or immunohistochemical methods), and drug efflux (by laser flow cytometry) may be the best ways to monitor multidrug resistance in human tumors.","['Ramachandran, C', 'Sauerteig, A', 'Sridhar, K S', 'Thurer, R J', 'Krishan, A']","['Ramachandran C', 'Sauerteig A', 'Sridhar KS', 'Thurer RJ', 'Krishan A']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Miami Medical School, FL 33101.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Animals', 'Doxorubicin/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Leukemia P388/genetics', 'Lung Neoplasms/chemistry/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*analysis', 'Mice', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*analysis', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00685031 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 1993;31(6):431-41. doi: 10.1007/BF00685031.,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",,,,['CA-R01 44737/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['MDR-1'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Protein kinase-inhibitory activity of NA-382 was lower but more selective to Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent protein kinase than that of staurosporine. NA-382 at noncytotoxic concentrations effectively reversed in vitro multidrug resistance of Adriamycin-resistant P388 (P388/ADR) cells, without influencing the drug sensitivity of sensitive P388 cells. NA-382 inhibited extrusion of vinblastine (VBL) and increased intracellular accumulation of VBL, more in P388/ADR cells than in sensitive P388 cells, with higher potency than staurosporine. This compound also reduced VBL resistance of other multidrug-resistant cell lines, AH66 and K562/ADR, by inhibiting VBL efflux and promoting VBL accumulation. NA-382 also dose dependently potentiated the effects of VBL and Adriamycin in P388/ADR-bearing mice. The toxicity of staurosporine was too high to use the combination with VBL in vitro and in vivo. NA-382 accumulated VBL in P388/ADR cells even after desensitization of Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent protein kinase by treatment with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate and 18 h, while being suppressed by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate added simultaneously or shortly before NA-382. Both staurosporine and NA-382 inhibited the photolabeling of [3H]azidopine on M(r) 140,000 P-glycoprotein in the plasma membrane from P388/ADR cells. These results indicate that this new staurosporine analogue, NA-382, reverses multidrug resistance by directly inhibiting the drug binding to P-glycoprotein, but not by Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent protein kinase inhibitory action.","['Miyamoto, K', 'Inoko, K', 'Wakusawa, S', 'Kajita, S', 'Hasegawa, T', 'Takagi, K', 'Koyama, M']","['Miyamoto K', 'Inoko K', 'Wakusawa S', 'Kajita S', 'Hasegawa T', 'Takagi K', 'Koyama M']","['Research Laboratory for Development of Medicine, School of Pharmacy, Hokuriku University, Kanazawa, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1', 'Alkaloids/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Azides/pharmacology', 'Dihydropyridines/pharmacology', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', '*Drug Resistance', 'Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia P388', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Staurosporine', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vinblastine/metabolism/pharmacology']",1993/04/01 00:00,1993/04/01 00:01,['1993/04/01 00:00'],"['1993/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1993 Apr 1;53(7):1555-9.,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (Azides)', '0 (Dihydropyridines)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '143086-33-3 (N-ethoxycarbonyl-7-oxostaurosporine)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', '63XR70204A (azidopine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
