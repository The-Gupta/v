Multiple independent studies have implicated Crkl, a small adapter protein, in transduction of oncogenic signals of Bcr/Abl and Crkl tyrosine-phosphorylation is used as a diagnostic tool for Philadelphia-positive leukemia. To evaluate the contribution of Crkl to this type of leukemia, we generated mutant mice that lack Crkl expression. We found that the overall survival of P190 BCR/ABL crkl-/- mice was comparable to that of genetically matched P190 BCR/ABL crkl +/+ mice. Both genotypes developed lymphoid lineage leukemia/lymphoma. Western blot analysis of -/- and +/+ lymphomas showed that the related Crk protein was tyrosine phosphorylated and could be found complexed with Bcr-Abl P190. These data indicate that possible therapeutic approaches that target Crkl may be complicated by the presence of pathways that compensate for lack of Crkl function.","['Hemmeryckx, Bianca', 'Reichert, Anja', 'Watanabe, Meguru', 'Kaartinen, Vesa', 'de Jong, Ron', 'Pattengale, Paul K', 'Groffen, John', 'Heisterkamp, Nora']","['Hemmeryckx B', 'Reichert A', 'Watanabe M', 'Kaartinen V', 'de Jong R', 'Pattengale PK', 'Groffen J', 'Heisterkamp N']","['Section of Molecular Carcinogenesis, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Ms #54, Childrens Hospital of Los Angeles Research Institute, and the Keck School of Medicine-University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA 90027, USA.']",['eng'],"['CA 50248/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 90321/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-crk)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Drug Design', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/*physiology', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*genetics', 'Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-crk', 'Signal Transduction/physiology']",2002/06/26 10:00,2002/07/24 10:01,['2002/06/26 10:00'],"['2001/11/06 00:00 [received]', '2002/02/14 00:00 [revised]', '2002/02/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/06/26 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/07/24 10:01 [medline]', '2002/06/26 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1205452 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 2002 May 9;21(20):3225-31. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1205452.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, we examined the methylation status of nine genes (p16(INK4A), MGMT, GSTP1, RASSF1A, APC, DAPK, RARbeta, CDH1 and CDH13) in 175 primary pediatric tumors and 23 tumor cell lines using methylation-specific PCR. We studied the major forms of pediatric tumors--Wilms' tumor, neuroblastoma, hepatoblastoma, medulloblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, osteosarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma, retinoblastoma and acute leukemia. The most frequently methylated gene in both primary tumors and cell lines was RASSF1A (40, 86%, respectively). However, the rates of RASSF1A methylation in individual tumor types varied from 0 to 88%. RASSF1A methylation was tumor specific and was absent in adjacent non-malignant tissues. Methylation of the other genes was relatively rare in tumors and non-malignant tissues (less than 5%). Neuroblastoma patients with methylation of RASSF1A were significantly older than patients without methylation (P=0.008). There was no relationship between methylation status and other clinico-pathologic parameters. We treated six cell lines lacking RASSF1A mRNA with 5-aza-2'deoxycytidine to examine the relationship between methylation and transcriptional silencing. In five of six cell lines, restoration of RASSF1A mRNA was confirmed by RT-PCR. Our findings indicate that aberrant promoter methylation of RASSF1A may contribute to the pathogenesis of many different forms of pediatric tumors.","['Harada, Kenichi', 'Toyooka, Shinichi', 'Maitra, Anirban', 'Maruyama, Riichiroh', 'Toyooka, Kiyomi O', 'Timmons, Charles F', 'Tomlinson, Gail E', 'Mastrangelo, Domenico', 'Hay, Robert J', 'Minna, John D', 'Gazdar, Adi F']","['Harada K', 'Toyooka S', 'Maitra A', 'Maruyama R', 'Toyooka KO', 'Timmons CF', 'Tomlinson GE', 'Mastrangelo D', 'Hay RJ', 'Minna JD', 'Gazdar AF']","['Hamon Center for Therapeutic Oncology Research, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas, TX 75390, USA.']",['eng'],['U01CA8497102/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RASSF1 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)']",IM,"['Alleles', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 3/genetics', '*DNA Methylation', 'DNA, Neoplasm/chemistry/genetics', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*Gene Silencing', '*Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Neoplasms/*genetics/pathology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', '*Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",2002/06/26 10:00,2002/07/24 10:01,['2002/06/26 10:00'],"['2001/12/26 00:00 [received]', '2002/02/15 00:00 [revised]', '2002/02/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/06/26 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/07/24 10:01 [medline]', '2002/06/26 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1205446 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 2002 Jun 20;21(27):4345-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1205446.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In mouse models, enforced retroviral expression of Hoxa9 alone in marrow is not sufficient to cause rapid AML, while co-expression of Meis1 and Hoxa9 induces rapid AML. In contrast, retroviral expression of Nup98-HoxA9 is sufficient to cause rapid AML in the absence of enforced Meis1 expression. Previously, we demonstrated that Hoxa9 could block the differentiation of murine marrow progenitors cultured in granulocyte-macrophage colony-simulating factor (GM-CSF). These progenitors lacked Meis1 expression, could not proliferate in stem cell factor (SCF), but could differentiate into neutrophils when switched into granulocyte colony-simulating factor (G-CSF). Ectopic expression of Meis1 in these Hoxa9 cells suppressed their G-CSF-induced differentiation, permitted proliferation in SCF, and therein offered a potential explanation of cooperative function. Because Meis1 binds N-terminal Hoxa9 sequences that are replaced by Nup98, we hypothesized that Nup98-HoxA9 might consolidate the biochemical functions of both Hoxa9 and Meis1 on target gene promoters and might evoke their same lymphokine-responsive profile in immortalized progenitors. Here we report that Nup98-HoxA9, indeed mimicks Hoxa9 plus Meis1 coexpression - it immortalizes myeloid progenitors, prevents differentiation in response to GM-CSF, IL-3, G-CSF, and permits proliferation in SCF. Unexpectedly, however, Nup98-Hoxa9 also enforced strong transcription of the cellular Hoxa9, Hoxa7 and Meis1 genes at levels similar to those found in mouse AML's generated by proviral activation of Hoxa9 and Meis1. Using Hoxa9(-/-) marrow, we demonstrate that expression of Hoxa9 is not required for myeloid immortalization by Nup98-HoxA9. Rapid leukaemogenesis by Nup98-HoxA9 may therefore result from both the intrinsic functions of Nup98-HoxA9, as well as of those of coexpressed HOX and MEIS1 genes.","['Calvo, Katherine R', 'Sykes, David B', 'Pasillas, Martina P', 'Kamps, Mark P']","['Calvo KR', 'Sykes DB', 'Pasillas MP', 'Kamps MP']","['University of California School of Medicine, Department of Pathology 9500 Gilman Drive, La Jolla, California, CA 92093-0612, USA.']",['eng'],"['5P0CA23100-16/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA56876/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA77109-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (MEIS1 protein, human)', '0 (Meis1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein)', '0 (NUP98-HOXA9 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '0 (homeobox protein HOXA9)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Motifs', 'Animals', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Cytokines/*pharmacology', '*Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Homeodomain Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/etiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Multigene Family', 'Myeloid Cells/*cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/*physiology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/physiology', 'Stem Cell Factor/pharmacology', 'Transcription, Genetic/physiology', 'Translocation, Genetic']",2002/06/26 10:00,2002/07/24 10:01,['2002/06/26 10:00'],"['2001/07/10 00:00 [received]', '2002/02/28 00:00 [revised]', '2002/04/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/06/26 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/07/24 10:01 [medline]', '2002/06/26 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1205516 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 2002 Jun 20;21(27):4247-56. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1205516.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To investigate the effects of BCR-ABL on multipotent hematopoietic cells, a temperature sensitive BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase was expressed in the cell line, FDCP-Mix. BCR-ABL mediated an increase in c-kit expression that correlated with an enhanced mitogenic response to SCF. This was not observed in the absence of Bcr-Abl kinase activity or presence of the BCR-ABL inhibitor STI571, which also inhibits c-kit. When cultured in a combination of SCF plus G-CSF the FDCP-Mix cells undergo neutrophilic differentiation over a 7-10 day period. When BCR-ABL was active there was a marked inhibition of cell maturation compared to control cells in which BCR-ABL was either inactive or not present. However, BCR-ABL did not block differentiation as the cells eventually undergo terminal maturation. These data argue that BCR-ABL is directly responsible for the enhanced response to SCF reported in CML progenitor cells. Furthermore, although the primary effect of STI571 is via direct inhibition of BCR-ABL, STI571 additionally reduces the enhanced response to SCF. Thus there are two sites of STI571 action of potential importance in Bcr-Abl expressing cells.","['Pierce, Andrew', 'Spooncer, Elaine', 'Ainsworth, Shaun', 'Whetton, Anthony D']","['Pierce A', 'Spooncer E', 'Ainsworth S', 'Whetton AD']","['Department of Biomolecular Sciences, Leukaemia Research Fund Cellular Development Unit, UMIST, Sackville Street, Manchester M60 1QD, UK.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Neutrophils/cytology', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Stem Cell Factor/*pharmacology', 'Up-Regulation']",2002/06/26 10:00,2002/07/30 10:01,['2002/06/26 10:00'],"['2001/10/30 00:00 [received]', '2002/02/06 00:00 [revised]', '2002/02/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/06/26 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/07/30 10:01 [medline]', '2002/06/26 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1205424 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 2002 May 2;21(19):3068-75. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1205424.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have previously reported the identification of a p53-regulated mouse gene DDA3. The 5' upstream genomic region of the mouse DDA3 was cloned, and sequence analysis revealed the presence of a potential p53 response element (RE2) residing at nucleotides +390 approximately +409 relative to the first translation start site. When fused upstream to a luciferase reporter gene, 5' genomic regions of the DDA3 gene containing RE2 were shown to be responsive to the wild-type, but not mutant p53, in a transient transfection assay. RE2 was sufficient to confer the transactivation responsiveness to p53. Furthermore, gel mobility shift analysis showed that RE2 formed specific complexes with wild-type p53. Induction of DDA3 was found in adriamycin treated normal mouse embryonic fibroblast cells (MEF), but not in p53 knockout (p53(-/-)) MEF. Overexpression of p73 induced DDA3 mRNA expression, and luciferase reporter analysis indicated that RE2 was responsive to transactivation by members of the p73 family proteins. Consistent with these findings, elevated expression of p73 protein and DDA3 mRNA were observed concomitantly in the p53(-/-) MEF cells treated with cisplatin.

JunD is one of the three members of the Jun family and shares some functional characteristics with c-Jun. In the present study, we found that the exposure of myeloblastic leukemia ML-1 cells to UV light (UVC) caused a significant increase in junD mRNA expression within 5 min that persisted for a period of 3 h. The activation of protein kinase C (PKC) with 12-O-tetradecaoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) also induced increases in junD expression similar to those of UV irradiation. In addition, UV irradiation- and TPA-induced increases in junD expression were completely abolished by GF-109203X, a PKC-specific inhibitor. UV irradiation activated intracellular signaling pathways including extracellular regulated kinase-2 (Erk-2), c-Jun N-terminal kinases-1 (JNK-1), and p38. However, TPA-induced activation of PKC affected only Erk-2 activity, and GF-109203X (a PKC inhibitor) markedly suppressed UV-induced Erk-2 activation. To further investigate the effect of UV-induced Erk-2 activation on the expression of junD mRNA, cDNA encoding mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK1) was overexpressed in ML-1 cells. The overexpression of MEK1 enhanced substantially junD expression in response to UV or TPA. In contrast, the suppression of Erk activation with PD98059, a specific inhibitor of MEK1, inhibited UV- and TPA-induced junD mRNA expression, UV-induced increases in caspase-3 activities, and cell death. In addition, the overexpression of junD enhanced the UV irradiation-induced increases in caspase-3 activity and cell death. We conclude that UV irradiation-induced increases in junD expression in ML-1 cells are mediated through activation of the PKC-coupled Erk-2 signaling pathway and play an important role in ML-1 cell apoptosis.","['Li, Tie', 'Dai, Wei', 'Lu, Luo']","['Li T', 'Dai W', 'Lu L']","['Division of Molecular Medicine, Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, School of Medicine, University of California Los Angeles, Torrance, California 90502, USA.']",['eng'],"['CA74229/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'EY10669/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Culture Media, Serum-Free)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 8)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Death', 'Culture Media, Serum-Free/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 8', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Protein Kinase C/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Time Factors', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', '*Ultraviolet Rays', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases']",2002/06/26 10:00,2002/10/31 04:00,['2002/06/26 10:00'],"['2002/06/26 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/10/31 04:00 [medline]', '2002/06/26 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M203519200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(20)74407-8 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2002 Sep 6;277(36):32668-76. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M203519200.

Although a thymic lymphoma is defined as thymus-dependent T-cell malignancy, diagnostic criteria vary between studies and considerable heterogeneity has been reported. To define and classify the thymic lymphomas that arose in our study of X-irradiated (CBA/HxC57BL/6)F1, F1 backcross and F1 intercross mice, 66 thymic lymphomas were immunogenotyped for immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) and T-cell receptor beta (TCRbeta) gene rearrangements, and/or analysed for expression of lineage-specific markers and allelic loss on chromosome 4. The data indicate that 33% of the thymic lymphomas are very similar to mouse radiation-induced acute myeloid (AML) and mixed lineage (IgH(R), TCRbeta(G)) pre-B lympho-myeloid (L-MLs) leukaemias, 33% are mixed lineage (IgH(R), TCRbeta(R)) B/T lymphoid and <33% can be described as single lineage (IgH(G), TCRbeta(R)) T-cell malignancies. As the myeloid and L-ML leukaemias are not thymus-dependent this suggests that a malignant myeloid or pre-B lympho-myeloid cell can colonize the spleen to give an AML or L-ML leukaemia, or can colonize the thymus where TCRbeta gene rearrangement(s) may be induced to give the mixed lineage thymic lymphomas. Thus, assuming the single lineage T-cell thymic lymphomas fulfil the criteria of a thymus-dependent T-cell malignancy, thymic lymphomas are comprised of at least three distinct malignancies.","['Boulton, Emma', 'Cleary, Helen', 'Plumb, Mark']","['Boulton E', 'Cleary H', 'Plumb M']","['MRC Radiation and Genome Stability Unit, Chilton Didcot, Oxfordshire OX11 ORD, UK.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Carcinogenesis,Carcinogenesis,8008055,['0 (Genetic Markers)'],IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology/pathology', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'Crosses, Genetic', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genotype', '*Loss of Heterozygosity', 'Lymphoma/*genetics/immunology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/genetics/immunology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/genetics/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred CBA', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/genetics/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/pathology', 'Thymus Neoplasms/*genetics/immunology', 'X-Rays']",2002/06/26 10:00,2002/08/01 10:01,['2002/06/26 10:00'],"['2002/06/26 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/01 10:01 [medline]', '2002/06/26 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/carcin/23.6.1079 [doi]'],ppublish,Carcinogenesis. 2002 Jun;23(6):1079-85. doi: 10.1093/carcin/23.6.1079.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In a previous study, we performed asymmetric modifications in which an Ile residue was replaced by Gly, Leu or Phe to disturb the symmetry [Doi et al. (1999) Biopolymers49, 459-469]. In this study, the modifications were extended. The Ile1 residue was replaced by Gly, Ala, aminoisobutyric acid (Aib), Val, Leu, Phe or d-Ile, and the d-Val3 residue was replaced by Val. The structures of these analogs were analyzed by X-ray diffraction, 1H NMR and CD techniques. X-Ray diffraction analyses revealed that the [Ala1], [Aib1] and [Phe1]ASC analogs are folded, whereas [Val1]ASC has a square form. These structures are the first examples of folded structures for ASC analogs in the crystal state and are similar to the previously reported structures of [Gly1] and [Phe1]ASC in solution. The resonances of amide NH and Thz CH protons linearly shift with temperature changes; in particular, those of [Aib1], [d-Ile1] and [Val3]ASCs exhibited a large temperature dependence. DMSO titration caused nonlinear shifts of proton resonances for all analogs and largely affected [d-Ile1] and [Val3]ASCs. A similar tendency was observed upon the addition of acetone to peptide solutions. Regarding peptide concentration changes, amide NH and Thz CH protons of [Gly1]ASC showed a relatively large dependence. CD spectra of these analogs indicated approximately two patterns in MeCN solution, which were related to the crystal structures. However, all spectra showed a similar positive Cotton effect in TFE solution, except that of [Val3]ASC. In the cytotoxicity test using P388 cells, [Val1]ASC exhibited the strongest activity, whereas the epimers of ASC ([d-Ile1] and [Val3]ASCs), showed fairly moderate activities.","['Asano, A', 'Minoura, K', 'Yamada, T', 'Numata, A', 'Ishida, T', 'Katsuya, Y', 'Mezaki, Y', 'Sasaki, M', 'Taniguchi, T', 'Nakai, M', 'Hasegawa, H', 'Terashima, A', 'Doi, M']","['Asano A', 'Minoura K', 'Yamada T', 'Numata A', 'Ishida T', 'Katsuya Y', 'Mezaki Y', 'Sasaki M', 'Taniguchi T', 'Nakai M', 'Hasegawa H', 'Terashima A', 'Doi M']","['Osaka University of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Osaka, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Denmark,J Pept Res,The journal of peptide research : official journal of the American Peptide Society,9707067,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Peptides, Cyclic)', '0 (Solvents)', '86701-12-4 (ascidiacyclamide)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Substitution', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Circular Dichroism', 'Crystallography, X-Ray', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/metabolism', 'Leukemia P388', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/drug therapy', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Peptides, Cyclic/*chemistry/pharmacology/toxicity', 'Solvents', 'Temperature', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/06/26 10:00,2003/07/12 05:00,['2002/06/26 10:00'],"['2002/06/26 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/12 05:00 [medline]', '2002/06/26 10:00 [entrez]']","['2o981 [pii]', '10.1034/j.1399-3011.2002.02981.x [doi]']",ppublish,J Pept Res. 2002 Jul;60(1):10-22. doi: 10.1034/j.1399-3011.2002.02981.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In a previous report, to elucidate the relationship between the net charge and anti-tumor activity of cSBL, we examined the effect of chemical modifications of cSBL with a water-soluble carbodiimide in the presence of various nucleophiles. The results suggested that the anti-tumor activity and internalization into tumor cells increased with an increase in the net charge of cSBL. However, in the chemically modified cSBL, a modification site was observed on average in two of the carboxyl groups of cSBL. To confirm these previous results and to determine which modified carboxyl group contributes to the increase in anti-tumor activity, we prepared mutants with substitutions of Asn/Gln and Arg at three acidic amino acid residues of cSBL and studied their anti-tumor activity and internalization efficiency. The results showed the enhancing effect of charge on anti-tumor activity and internalization, and suggested that the replacement of D24 and E88 of cSBL with arginine is more effective than that of E97. The double mutant D24RE88R showed comparable anti-tumor activity to the ethylenediamine-modified cSBL reported previously. The mutant was well-characterized as a pure cSBL derivative suitable for studying the mechanism of the anti-tumor action of cSBL.","['Ogawa, Yuko', 'Iwama, Masanori', 'Ohgi, Kazuko', 'Tsuji, Tsutomu', 'Irie, Masachika', 'Itagaki, Tadashi', 'Kobayashi, Hiroko', 'Inokuchi, Norio']","['Ogawa Y', 'Iwama M', 'Ohgi K', 'Tsuji T', 'Irie M', 'Itagaki T', 'Kobayashi H', 'Inokuchi N']","['Department of Microbiology, Hoshi College of Pharmacy, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Japan,Biol Pharm Bull,Biological & pharmaceutical bulletin,9311984,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Lectins)', '30KYC7MIAI (Aspartic Acid)', '3KX376GY7L (Glutamic Acid)', '7006-34-0 (Asparagine)', '94ZLA3W45F (Arginine)', 'EC 3.1.- (Ribonucleases)', 'GZP2782OP0 (N-Acetylneuraminic Acid)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Substitution/genetics', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Arginine/*metabolism', 'Asparagine/*metabolism', 'Aspartic Acid/*metabolism', 'Cell Division/physiology', 'Circular Dichroism', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Escherichia coli/metabolism', 'Glutamic Acid/*metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Lectins/metabolism', 'Leukemia P388/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'N-Acetylneuraminic Acid/*metabolism', 'Rana catesbeiana', 'Ribonucleases/antagonists & inhibitors']",2002/06/26 10:00,2003/01/01 04:00,['2002/06/26 10:00'],"['2002/06/26 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/01 04:00 [medline]', '2002/06/26 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1248/bpb.25.722 [doi]'],ppublish,Biol Pharm Bull. 2002 Jun;25(6):722-7. doi: 10.1248/bpb.25.722.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The presence of the ETV6/ARG translocation raises the possibility that the resulting fusion protein functions as an oncogene. However, the transforming activity of the ETV6/ARG protein has not been determined and its contribution to leukemogenesis is therefore unknown. Here we address this question by analysing the oncogenic activity of ETV6/ARG in hematopoietic and fibroblast cells. It is demonstrated that expression of ETV6/ARG confers IL3-independent growth to Ba/F3 cells and anchorage independent growth to Rat-1 fibroblasts. It is also shown that multiple signaling molecules, including PI3K, SHC, ras-GAP and CRK-L, are tyrosine phosphorylated in Ba/F3 cells that express ETV6/ARG. Analysis of four different types of ETV6/ARG transcripts previously identified in the AML-M3 leukemia cell line HT93A suggest that ETV6 HLH domain is required for oncogenic activity. Based upon these results it is concluded that ARG can be activated as an oncogene in human malignancy and that the ETV6/ARG oncoprotein triggers some of the same signaling pathways associated with activated ABL oncogenes.","['Iijima, Yoshimi', 'Okuda, Keiko', 'Tojo, Arinobu', 'Tri, Nguyen Khanh', 'Setoyama, Misao', 'Sakaki, Yoshiyuki', 'Asano, Shigetaka', 'Tokunaga, Katsushi', 'Kruh, Gary D', 'Sato, Yuko']","['Iijima Y', 'Okuda K', 'Tojo A', 'Tri NK', 'Setoyama M', 'Sakaki Y', 'Asano S', 'Tokunaga K', 'Kruh GD', 'Sato Y']","['Division of Molecular Cytogenetics, Department of Clinical Pathology, Research Institute, International Medical Center of Japan, Tokyo 162-0052, Japan.']",['eng'],['CA57273/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (ETS translocation variant 6 protein)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '21820-51-9 (Phosphotyrosine)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (ARG tyrosine kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Division/physiology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/*metabolism', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*physiology', 'Fibroblasts/metabolism', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/chemistry/genetics', 'Genes, abl/physiology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phosphotyrosine/metabolism', 'Plasmids', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets', 'Rats', 'Recombinant Proteins/chemistry/genetics', 'Repressor Proteins/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tyrosine/metabolism']",2002/06/25 10:00,2002/07/19 10:01,['2002/06/25 10:00'],"['2001/03/07 00:00 [received]', '2002/03/27 00:00 [revised]', '2002/04/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/06/25 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/07/19 10:01 [medline]', '2002/06/25 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1205544 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 2002 Jun 27;21(28):4374-83. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1205544.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To identify the most effective anti-angiogenic molecule for delivery by retroviral vectors, we investigated the effects of angiostatin, endostatin and interferon(IFN)-alpha(1) gene transfer in in vivo models of breast cancer induced neovascularization and tumor growth. Moloney leukemia virus-based retroviral vectors for expression of murine angiostatin, endostatin and IFN-alpha(1) were generated, characterized, and used to transduce human breast cancer cell lines (MCF7 and MDA-MB435). Secretion of the recombinant proteins was confirmed by biological and Western blotting assays. Their production did not impair in vitro growth of these breast cancer cells nor their viability, and did not interfere with the expression of angiogenic factors. However, primary endothelial cell proliferation and migration in vitro were inhibited by supernatants of the transduced cells containing angiostatin, endostatin, and IFN-alpha(1). Stable gene transfer of the IFN-alpha(1) cDNA by retroviral vectors in both MCF7 and MDA-MB435 cells resulted in a marked and long-lasting inhibition of tumor growth in nude mice that was associated with reduced vascularization. Endostatin reduced the in vivo growth of MDA-MB435, but not MCF7 cells, despite similar levels of in vivo production, and angiostatin did not impair the in vivo growth of either cell line. These findings indicate heterogeneity in the therapeutic efficacy of angiostatic molecules delivered by viral vectors and suggest that gene therapy with IFN-alpha(1) and endostatin might be useful for treatment of breast cancer.","['Indraccolo, S', 'Gola, E', 'Rosato, A', 'Minuzzo, S', 'Habeler, W', 'Tisato, V', 'Roni, V', 'Esposito, G', 'Morini, M', 'Albini, A', 'Noonan, D M', 'Ferrantini, M', 'Amadori, A', 'Chieco-Bianchi, L']","['Indraccolo S', 'Gola E', 'Rosato A', 'Minuzzo S', 'Habeler W', 'Tisato V', 'Roni V', 'Esposito G', 'Morini M', 'Albini A', 'Noonan DM', 'Ferrantini M', 'Amadori A', 'Chieco-Bianchi L']","['IST-Viral and Molecular Oncology Section-Padova, Padova, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Gene Ther,Gene therapy,9421525,"['0 (Angiogenesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Endostatins)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '86090-08-6 (Angiostatins)', '9001-91-6 (Plasminogen)', '9007-34-5 (Collagen)']",IM,"['Angiogenesis Inhibitors/*genetics', 'Angiostatins', 'Animals', 'Breast Neoplasms/blood supply/*therapy', 'Collagen/genetics', 'Endostatins', 'Female', 'Genetic Therapy/*methods', 'Genetic Vectors/*administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Peptide Fragments/genetics', 'Plasminogen/genetics', 'Transduction, Genetic/methods', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/06/25 10:00,2002/08/10 10:01,['2002/06/25 10:00'],"['2001/09/20 00:00 [received]', '2002/02/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/06/25 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/10 10:01 [medline]', '2002/06/25 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.gt.3301703 [doi]'],ppublish,Gene Ther. 2002 Jul;9(13):867-78. doi: 10.1038/sj.gt.3301703.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A role of PML in multiple pathways of apoptosis was conclusively demonstrated using PML(-/-) animal and cell culture models. In a previous study, we found that PML sensitizes tumor necrosis factor-induced apoptosis in tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-resistant U2OS cells. This finding helped to explain the mechanism of PML-induced apoptosis. The zinc finger protein A20 is a target gene of NF kappa B inducible by TNF alpha, and it is a potent inhibitor of TNF-induced apoptosis. In the this study, we demonstrated that PML is a transcriptional repressor of the A20 promoter and that PML represses A20 expression induced by TNF alpha. We showed that PML inhibits A20 transactivation through the NF kappa B site by interfering with its binding to the promoter. We also showed that stable overexpression of A20 inhibits apoptosis and caspase activation induced by PML/TNF alpha. The results of this study suggest that A20 is a downstream target of PML-induced apoptosis and supports a role of A20 in modulating cell death induced by PML/TNF alpha in TNF-resistant cells.","['Wu, Wen-Shu', 'Xu, Zhi-Xiang', 'Chang, Kun-Sang']","['Wu WS', 'Xu ZX', 'Chang KS']","['Department of Molecular Pathology, The University of Texas M.

The present study addresses the question of whether hyperthermic pre-treatment also increases the tolerance against heat- and hydrogen peroxide-induced apoptosis in rat IPC-81 leukaemia cells. This cell line exhibits an aberrant heat shock response which is characterized by a lack of the inducible Hsp70 isoform, even under conditions of heat or hydrogen peroxide stress, while the constitutively expressed Hsc70 and the inducible isoform of hemoxygenase (HO-1) are strongly enhanced by heat stress (43.5 degrees C; 30 min). In spite of this Hsp70 deficiency, hyperthermic pre-treatment protects IPC-81 leukaemia cells against apoptotic cell death induced by heat or hydrogen peroxide, but is less effective against necrosis induced by higher doses of the applied stressors. Addition of hydrogen peroxide (25 microM) enhances the amount of bax mRNA, while the level of bcl-2 mRNA remains unchanged. No increase of bax mRNA, in contrast, could be detected in heat shock-primed IPC-81 cells when treated with hydrogen peroxide after a 12h recovery. These results indicate that hyperthermic pre-treatment may exert its anti-apoptotic function not only by enhanced expression of constitutive as well as inducible HSPs but also by lowering the level of bax transcripts and thereby increasing the Bcl-2/Bax ratio.","['Zeise, E', 'Rensing, L']","['Zeise E', 'Rensing L']","['Institute of Cell Biology, Biochemistry and Biotechnology, University of Bremen, PO Box 33 04 40, D-28334 Bremen, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Int J Hyperthermia,"International journal of hyperthermia : the official journal of European Society for Hyperthermic Oncology, North American Hyperthermia Group",8508395,"['0 (Bax protein, rat)', '0 (HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Oxidants)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'EC 1.14.14.18 (Heme Oxygenase (Decyclizing))', 'EC 1.14.14.18 (Heme Oxygenase-1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins/deficiency', 'Heme Oxygenase (Decyclizing)/metabolism', 'Heme Oxygenase-1', 'Hot Temperature', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/*pharmacology', '*Hyperthermia, Induced', '*Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Oxidants/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Rats', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/cytology/drug effects', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein']",2002/06/25 10:00,2002/07/31 10:01,['2002/06/25 10:00'],"['2002/06/25 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/07/31 10:01 [medline]', '2002/06/25 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/02656730210123561 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Hyperthermia. 2002 Jul-Aug;18(4):344-60. doi: 10.1080/02656730210123561.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MUM1 (multiple myeloma oncogene 1) is a protooncogene that is deregulated as a result of (6;14)(p25;q32) chromosomal translocation in multiple myeloma, and is also expressed in a variety of malignant lymphoma entities. We examined the expression of MUM1 in B-CLL / SLL, and found that 2 of 4 B-CLL-derived cell lines and 14 of 29 patients' specimens expressed MUM1 by immunohistochemical analysis. MUM1 expression was not associated with CD38 expression, somatic hypermutation of immunoglobulin heavy chain gene variable region (IgV(H)), or any other clinical characteristics of the patients. Interestingly, the patients who were positive for MUM1 showed shorter overall survival times than those who were negative for MUM1 (50% survival: 22 months vs. 82 months) (P = 0.0008, log-rank test). Multivariate analysis by Cox's proportional-hazards regression model showed that MUM1 expression and unmutated IgV(H) status were independent unfavorable prognostic factors in patients with B-CLL / SLL. These findings suggest that MUM1 expression is a useful prognostic factor in B-CLL / SLL.

In dermato-oncology, IFNs have been used primarily in melanoma, but also in nonmelanoma skin cancer, such as squamous and basal cell carcinomas, Kaposi sarcomas and lymphomas. Trials with IFNs have been performed in patients with melanoma in an adjuvant setting (stage II and III) and in metastatic disease (stage IV). While the response rates with IFNs as single agents in stage IV disease usually do not exceed 15%, the use of adjuvant IFNs has been claimed to increase disease-free survival (stage II), or even overall survival (stage III), in low- or high-dose regimens, respectively; the latter, however, involved numerous side-effects and were beset with lack of compliance and acceptance, as well as being very costly.

This retrospective study was used to detect evidence of abnormal therapy-related myelodysplasia/secondary acute myeloid leukaemia (tMDS/sAML) clones before HDT in a subset of patients who subsequently developed secondary neoplasia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 230 patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) underwent HDT comprising cyclophosphamide and total body irradiation (TBI) with autologous hematopoietic progenitor-cell support. Thirty-three patients have developed tMDS/sAML and 20 of these were screened for the presence of emerging therapy-related abnormalities before HDT. A further 24 patients without evidence of secondary neoplasia were screened using fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH). RESULTS: Significant levels of abnormal cells were identified in 20/20 patients screened who have developed secondary neoplasia compared with only three of 24 patients in the HDT control group who have not. The latter three patients have since died. CONCLUSIONS: The triple FISH assay was developed to detect loss of chromosomal material from 5q31, 7q22 and 13q14. It can potentially identify those patients at risk of alkylating agent-induced leukaemia before they proceed to HDT.

Second cancers include leukemias that generally occur in the first two decades after therapy, and adult-type solid tumors that generally exhibit continued increasing incidence throughout subsequent follow-up. Identified clinical risk factors for second cancers include age at the time of treatment and intensity and type of therapy, with particularly strong associations between the use of radiotherapy and subsequent breast cancer, and alkylator chemotherapy dose-intensity and risk of secondary leukemia. However, second cancers affect a minority of patients, and there is probably great variability in individual susceptibility for this complication. Common genetic polymorphisms in drug-metabolizing enzymes that result in impaired detoxification of chemotherapy or inefficient repair of drug- or radiation-induced genetic damage may lead to increased risk of a second cancer. Studies of the potential role of polymorphisms in the genes encoding the glutathione S-transferases, cytochrome P450 3A4, NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase and myeloperoxidase in the etiology of treatment-related complications are reviewed. Biological markers of drug- and radiation-induced genetic damage may also identify patients at higher risk of immediate and delayed side effects of therapy. The Children's Oncology Group (COG) is examining the roles of polymorphisms in drug metabolizing enzymes and biological markers of genotoxicity in predicting the treatment-related outcomes of patients with HL.

Although promising, this experience is not yet available. Moreover, the risk of possible reimplantation of malignant stem cells with the thawed cryoperserved ovary has been raised following experimental animal observations. Therefore, until these innovative endeavors prove successful, we have attempted to minimize the gonadotoxic effect of chemotherapy by the co-treatment with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonistic analog (GnRH-a) to induce a temporary prepubertal milieu. The immunoreactive inhibin-A and -B in these patients was measured before, during and following the gonadotoxic chemotherapy. METHODS: A prospective clinical protocol was undertaken in 60 women aged 15-40 years with lymphoma, 10 with leukemia and 10 undergoing chemotherapeutic treatments for non-malignant diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus or other autoimmune diseases. A monthly injection of depot D-TRP(6)-GnRH-a was administered from before starting the chemotherapy until its conclusion, up to a maximum of 6 months. Hormonal profile [follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), E2, T, P4, insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1, IGF-BP3 and prolactin) was taken before starting the GnRH-a/chemotherapy co-treatment, and monthly thereafter until resumtion of spontaneous ovulation. This group was compared with a control group of 60 women who have been treated with similar chemotherapy. RESULTS: Whereas all but three (40, 36 and 34 year old) of the surviving patients within the GnRH-a/ chemotherapy co-treatment group resumed spontaneous ovulation and menses within 12 months, less than half of the patients in the 'control' group (chemotherapy without GnRH-a co-treatment) resumed ovarian function and regular cyclic activity (P <0.05). The remaining 55% experienced premature ovarian failure (POF). Temporarily increased FSH concentrations were experienced by about one-third of the patients resuming cyclic ovarian function, suggesting reversible ovarian damage in a larger proportion of women than those experiencing POF. Inhibin-A and -B decreased during the GnRH-a/ chemotherapy co-treatment but increased to normal levels in patients who resumed regular ovarian cyclicity, and/or spontaneously conceived, as compared with low levels in those who developed POF. CONCLUSIONS: If these preliminary data are consisent in a larger group of patients, GnRH-a co-treatment should be considered in every woman of reproductive age receiving chemotherapy, in addition to assisted reproductive technologies and the investigation into ovarian cryopreservation for future in vitro maturation, autotransplantation or xenotransplantation.","['Blumenfeld, Z', 'Dann, E', 'Avivi, I', 'Epelbaum, R', 'Rowe, J M']","['Blumenfeld Z', 'Dann E', 'Avivi I', 'Epelbaum R', 'Rowe JM']","['Department of Obstetrics/Gynecology, Hematology and Oncology, Rambam Medical Center, The B.

Autologous stem cell transplantation (autoSCT) is usually preferred to alloSCT due to its widespread availability, lack of the immunological problems intrinsic to the development of graft-versus-host disease (GvHD), and the infrequent bone marrow involvement present in HD patients undergoing high-dose chemotherapy/radiotherapy. AlloSCT has been associated with a high transplant-related mortality (TRM) in patients with HD due to a high incidence of GvHD and of fatal infectious events after transplantation. The poor outcome of these patients after alloSCT may reflect in part the advanced status of the disease at transplantation and the poor performance status of the patient population allografted. Furthermore, the high TRM present in t h e conventional alloSCT setting hasnever allowed a proper evaluation of a possible graft-versus-Hodgkin's effect. In an effort to reduce the TRM associated with alloSCT, low-intensity regimens have been developed; the curative potential of these protocols would rely on the graft-versus-leukemia effect of the allogeneic infusion more than in the conditioning regimen per se. Although the number of HD patients allografted with reduced-intensity protocols is low and the follow-up still short, TRM seems lower than in the conventional allograft setting despite a similar incidence of acute GvHD (aGvHD). Overall and progression-free survival seem promising, and patients developing aGvHD after transplantation or donor lymphocyte infusions seem to be at a lower risk of relapse than those not presenting this complication.","['Sureda, A', 'Schmitz, N']","['Sureda A', 'Schmitz N']","['Clinical Hematology Division, Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau, Barcelona, Spain.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Ann Oncol,Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,9007735,,IM,"['Disease Progression', 'Disease-Free Survival', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hodgkin Disease/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*therapy', 'Remission Induction', 'Salvage Therapy', 'Survival Rate', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",2002/06/25 10:00,2002/12/17 04:00,['2002/06/25 10:00'],"['2002/06/25 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/17 04:00 [medline]', '2002/06/25 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1093/annonc/13.s1.128 [doi]', 'S0923-7534(20)31244-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Oncol. 2002;13 Suppl 1:128-32. doi: 10.1093/annonc/13.s1.128.,,,,,,,33,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The literature is reviewed and the role of rapid viral diagnosis in the clinical management of this complication is discussed. A 10-year-old girl with relapsed acute myeloid leukemia after allogeneic bone marrow transplant underwent re-induction chemotherapy with high-dose cytosine arabinoside and amsacrine. During induction she developed diarrhea and a marked coagulopathy, followed by fulminant hepatic failure and acute pre-renal failure. She rapidly deteriorated and died. A limited autopsy was performed. Adenovirus type 5 was cultured from ante mortem clinical samples and detected by polymerase chain reaction in postmortem samples of heart blood, lung, trachea, spleen, and liver. At autopsy, the liver demonstrated massive hepatic necrosis with positive immunofluorescence for adenovirus. Electron microscopy demonstrated intranuclear inclusions, typical of adenovirus. There was no evidence of pneumonia. Adenovirus can cause fulminant hepatic necrosis following chemotherapy in a nontransplant setting. If adenoviral disease is suspected, appropriate rapid viral studies should be undertaken, because early intervention with ribavirin or cidofovir may prevent rapid fulminant progression. Further studies on the role of antiviral therapy in this setting are warranted.","['Kaur, Balveer', 'Gottardo, Nick G', 'Keil, Anthony D', 'Hallam, Lavinia A', 'Baker, David L']","['Kaur B', 'Gottardo NG', 'Keil AD', 'Hallam LA', 'Baker DL']","['Department of Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, Princess Margaret Hospital for Children, Perth, Western Australia, Australia.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Pediatric hematology and oncology,8700164,,IM,"['Adenovirus Infections, Human/*etiology/pathology', 'Adolescent', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Hepatitis, Viral, Human/*etiology/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications/*drug therapy/virology', 'Liver/*pathology', 'Necrosis', 'Recurrence']",2002/06/25 10:00,2002/12/11 04:00,['2002/06/25 10:00'],"['2002/06/25 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/11 04:00 [medline]', '2002/06/25 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/08880010290057390 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2002 Jul-Aug;19(5):361-71. doi: 10.1080/08880010290057390.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several novel signaling pathways by which retinoids induce cell death have been identified recently. They comprise (a) the induction by RARalpha-selective retinoids of the tumor-selective death ligand TRAIL that kills acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) cells in a paracrine mode of action, which is the cause of retinoic acid-induced apoptosis after maturation: (b) a novel RARalpha-independent rexinoid-PKA cross-talk that induces maturation of both ATRA-sensitive and ATRA-resistant APL cells and does not invoke ligand-induced alteration of PML-RARalpha signaling, stability, or compartmentalization; and (c) a novel rexinoid signaling pathway that triggers apoptosis of immature APL cells and may correspond to a default death pathway that is operative in the absence of ""survival"" factors. This rexinoid apoptosis is inhibited by RXR but not RAR antagonists and is distinct from that triggered by RAR agonists, which control cell maturation and postmaturation apoptosis.

To study the efficacy of noncytotoxic therapy in this animal model, cohorts of naive immunocompetent mice were inoculated with primary murine APL cells from a frozen tumor bank. Arsenic trioxide and liposomally encapsulated all-trans-retinoic acid (Lipo ATRA), alone or in combination, were administered for 21 days by i.p. injection using doses that yielded plasma levels similar to those observed in human APL patients treated with these agents. Lipo ATRA was highly effective in inducing durable molecular remissions in immunocompetent mice [C57BL/6 x C3H F(1) (B6C3HF1)]; arsenic therapy was much less effective, and did not clearly synergize with Lipo ATRA to increase the remission rate in immunocompetent mice. The survival of Lipo ATRA-treated severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) animals (lacking functional T and B cells) was inferior to that of immunocompetent B6C3HF1 recipients (40% vs. 88% survival at 1 y, P < 0.001). These data suggest that adaptive immunity cooperates with pharmacologic therapy to induce or maintain remissions in murine APL. It also implies that immunosuppressive anti-leukemia therapies could paradoxically blunt effective anti-leukemia immune responses that are important for clearing small numbers of residual tumor cells after chemotherapy-mediated cytoreduction.","['Westervelt, Peter', 'Pollock, Jessica L', 'Oldfather, Kristie M', 'Walter, Matthew J', 'Ma, Margaret K', 'Williams, Anthony', 'DiPersio, John F', 'Ley, Timothy J']","['Westervelt P', 'Pollock JL', 'Oldfather KM', 'Walter MJ', 'Ma MK', 'Williams A', 'DiPersio JF', 'Ley TJ']","['Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Siteman Cancer Center, Washington University School of Medicine, 660 South Euclid Avenue, Campus Box 8007, St. Louis, MO 63110-1093, USA.']",['eng'],"['K08 HL003991/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA091842/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K08 HL03991/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA083962/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA83962/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Liposomes)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics', 'Humans', 'Immunocompetence', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/*immunology/metabolism', 'Liposomes', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Mice, SCID', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', 'Oxides/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics', 'Tretinoin/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics']",2002/06/22 10:00,2002/08/09 10:01,['2002/06/22 10:00'],"['2002/06/22 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/09 10:01 [medline]', '2002/06/22 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1073/pnas.132657799 [doi]', '132657799 [pii]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2002 Jul 9;99(14):9468-73. doi: 10.1073/pnas.132657799.

This results in mitochondrial hyperpolarization, dependent on the hydrolysis of glycolytic ATP by the F1F(o)-ATPase acting in reverse mode. During this early phase of activation, there is a transient release of superoxide anion. All these processes can be prevented by an inhibitor of NO synthase. Approximately 2 h after stimulation with anti-Fas Ab, a distinct second phase can be detected. This comprises a concentration-dependent collapse in mitochondrial membrane potential, a second wave of free radical production, and activation of caspase-8 leading to apoptosis. This second phase is abolished by an inhibitor of caspase activation. In contrast, inhibition of NO synthesis leads to an enhancement and acceleration of these latter processes, suggesting that the early NO-dependent phase represents a protective mechanism.

In line with the concept, cross-linked Ag receptors have been shown to associate with detergent-insoluble raft fraction without the aid of Src family kinases. However, it has not been established whether spatial raft coalescence could also precede Src family kinase activation. In this study, we showed that spatial raft coalescence after low-affinity FcgammaR cross-linking in RAW264.7 macrophages is independent of Src family kinase activity. The lateral raft assembly was found to be ascribed to the action of ligand-binding subunits, rather than to immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif-bearing signal subunits, because monomeric murine FcgammaRIIb expressed in rat basophilic leukemia cells successfully induced spatial raft reorganization after cross-linking. We also showed that extracellular and transmembrane region of FcgammaRIIb is sufficient for raft stabilization. Moreover, this receptor fragment triggers rapid calcium mobilization and linker for activation of T cells phosphorylation, in a manner sensitive to Src family kinase inhibition and to cholesterol depletion. Presence of immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif and addition of immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif to the receptor fragment abolished and enhanced the responses, respectively, but did not affect raft stabilization.

Chronic phase chronic myelogenous leukemia patients treated with STI571 have durable responses; however, most responding blast phase patients relapse despite continued therapy. Co-crystallization studies of Abl kinase and an STI571-related compound identify specific amino acid residues as critical to STI571 binding, one of which, T315, has been characterized as an acquired Thr to Ile mutation in relapsed patients. Other studies, however, suggest that mutations other than these predicted contact points are capable of conferring STI571 resistance in relapsed patients. Using a variety of models of STI571 binding to the Abl kinase, we have performed an extensive mutational analysis of sites that might alter the sensitivity of the Abl kinase to STI571. Although mutation of many of the predicted contact points between Abl and STI571 result in a kinase-inactive protein, additional mutations that render the Abl kinase less sensitive to STI571 demonstrate a broad range of possibilities for clinical resistance that are now becoming evident.","['Corbin, Amie S', 'Buchdunger, Elisabeth', 'Pascal, Furet', 'Druker, Brian J']","['Corbin AS', 'Buchdunger E', 'Pascal F', 'Druker BJ']","['Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, Oregon 97201, USA.']",['eng'],"['1R01 CA65823/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K24 CA82445/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (ARG tyrosine kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/*metabolism', 'Benzamides', 'Binding Sites', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics', 'Models, Molecular', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', '*Point Mutation', 'Protein Conformation', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/*chemistry', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry', 'Recombinant Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Substrate Specificity']",2002/06/22 10:00,2002/10/18 04:00,['2002/06/22 10:00'],"['2002/06/22 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/10/18 04:00 [medline]', '2002/06/22 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M111525200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(20)70084-0 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2002 Aug 30;277(35):32214-9. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M111525200.

Neuronal intranuclear inclusions (NIIs), as in other polyglutamine diseases, are pathological hallmarks of these disorders. NIIs in polyglutamine diseases contain not only the protein with the expanded polyglutamine stretch but also other types of proteins. Several chaperone proteins related to the ubiquitin proteasome pathway, transcription factors and nuclear matrix proteins have been detected in NIIs. The composition of NIIs might reflect the process of NII formation and part of the pathogenesis of these diseases. To investigate how these proteins relate to the pathogenesis of SCA7, we performed immunohistochemical analyses of the composition of NIIs in two cases of SCA7. We demonstrated that there are two types of NIIs in SCA7 that differ in size and immunoreactivity to promyelocytic leukaemia protein (PML), one of the essential components of nuclear bodies (NBs; also called PML oncogenic domains). Small and large NIIs contained ataxin-7, human DnaJ homologue 2 (HDJ-2) and proteasome subunit 19S. In contrast, PML was found only in small NIIs. CREB-binding protein (CBP), another component of NBs, was distributed like PML in NIIs. Our results suggest that NIIs are formed by the accumulation of ataxin-7 in NBs, which become enlarged as they recruit related proteins.","['Takahashi, Junko', 'Fujigasaki, Hiroto', 'Zander, Cecilia', 'El Hachimi, Khalid H', 'Stevanin, Giovanni', 'Durr, Alexandra', 'Lebre, Anne-Sophie', 'Yvert, Gael', 'Trottier, Yvon', 'de The, Hugues', 'Hauw, Jean-Jacques', 'Duyckaerts, Charles', 'Brice, Alexis']","['Takahashi J', 'Fujigasaki H', 'Zander C', 'El Hachimi KH', 'Stevanin G', 'Durr A', 'Lebre AS', 'Yvert G', 'Trottier Y', 'de The H', 'Hauw JJ', 'Duyckaerts C', 'Brice A']","['Laboratoire de Neuropathologie Raymond Escourolle, Paris, France.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Brain,Brain : a journal of neurology,0372537,"['0 (ATXN7 protein, human)', '0 (Ataxin-7)', '0 (Molecular Chaperones)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Ataxin-7', 'Brain/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism/*pathology/ultrastructure', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Inclusion Bodies/metabolism/*pathology/ultrastructure', 'Male', 'Molecular Chaperones/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Neurons/metabolism/*pathology/ultrastructure', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Spinocerebellar Degenerations/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Transcription Factors/*biosynthesis', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",2002/06/22 10:00,2002/08/16 10:01,['2002/06/22 10:00'],"['2002/06/22 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/16 10:01 [medline]', '2002/06/22 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/brain/awf154 [doi]'],ppublish,Brain. 2002 Jul;125(Pt 7):1534-43. doi: 10.1093/brain/awf154.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For this purpose a nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for a 444 bp fragment of the envelope (env) gene was used because it was previously reported that this region might be responsible for the serological status in the host. The PCR products from 60 samples of BLV-infected cells were digested with endonucleases BamH I, Bgl I, Bcl I, Hae III and Pvu II. RFLP analysis demonstrated that there were six different genotypes of BLV present among cattle in Japan. In some herds PCR-positive animals were infected with only one genotype, but in other herds a few genotypes were found. One genotype was dominant throughout infected cattle and it was also detected in neoplastic cells from three of four animals with lymphosarcoma and three cell lines persistently infected with BLV. Production of antibodies to BLV in each cattle was surveyed by agar gel immunodiffusion and indirect hemagglutination tests, and the results were compared with those obtained from PCR. No genotype related to decreased immunoreactivity was detected. The difference in anti-viral immune responses of each animal appears to be related to the infection stage and other host factors, not to genetic heterogeneity of the envelope gene.","['Licursi, Maria', 'Inoshima, Yasuo', 'Wu, Donglai', 'Yokoyama, Takashi', 'Gonzalez, Ester Teresa', 'Sentsui, Hiroshi']","['Licursi M', 'Inoshima Y', 'Wu D', 'Yokoyama T', 'Gonzalez ET', 'Sentsui H']","['National Institute of Animal Health, 3-1-5 Kannondai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Virus Res,Virus research,8410979,['0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Antibody Formation/*physiology', 'Base Sequence', 'Cattle', 'Enzootic Bovine Leukosis/prevention & control', '*Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genotype', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/*genetics/immunology/isolation & purification', 'Leukocytes/microbiology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/veterinary', 'Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*genetics']",2002/06/22 10:00,2003/07/02 05:00,['2002/06/22 10:00'],"['2002/06/22 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/02 05:00 [medline]', '2002/06/22 10:00 [entrez]']","['S016817020200059X [pii]', '10.1016/s0168-1702(02)00059-x [doi]']",ppublish,Virus Res. 2002 Jun;86(1-2):101-10. doi: 10.1016/s0168-1702(02)00059-x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVES: To study whether nystatin decreases morbidity and mortality when given prophylactically or therapeutically to patients with severe immunodeficiency. SEARCH STRATEGY: MEDLINE and The Cochrane Library using a comprehensive search strategy, date of last search November 2001. Contacted industry and scanned reference lists. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised trials comparing nystatin with placebo, an untreated control group, fluconazole or amphotericin B. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data on mortality, invasive fungal infection and colonisation were extracted by both authors independently. The outcomes were weighted by the inverse variance. A random effects model was used unless p>0.10 for the test of heterogeneity. MAIN RESULTS: We included 12 trials (1,464 patients). The drugs were given prophylactically in ten trials and as treatment in two. Seven trials were in acute leukaemia, two in cancer, one in liver transplant patients, one in critically ill surgical and trauma patients, and one in AIDS patients. Nystatin had been compared with placebo in three trials and with fluconazole in nine; the dose varied from 1.5 MIE to 72 MIE daily. The effect of nystatin was similar to that of placebo on fungal colonisation (relative risk 0.85, 95% confidence interval 0.65 to 1.13). There was no statistically significant difference between fluconazole and nystatin on mortality (relative risk 0.76, 0.49 to 1.18) whereas fluconazole was more effective in preventing invasive fungal infection (relative risk 0.37, 0.15 to 0.91) and colonisation (relative risk 0.49, 0.34 to 0.70). The results were very similar if the three studies which were not performed in cancer patients were excluded.

This effect was manifest with a significantly higher survival rate as compared to the control (L1210, P38, Ehrlich ascites), furthermore, by a decrease in the number and size of liver and lung metastases (LLT).","['Szende, B', 'Szokan, Gy', 'Tyiha, E', 'Pal, K', 'Gaborjanyi, R', 'Almas, M', 'Khlafulla, A R']","['Szende B', 'Szokan G', 'Tyiha E', 'Pal K', 'Gaborjanyi R', 'Almas M', 'Khlafulla AR']","['1st Institute of Pathology and Experimental Cancer Research, Joint Research Organisation, Hungarian Academy of Sciences and Semmelweis University, H-1085, Budapest, Ulloi ut 26, Hungary. bszende@korb1.sote.hu']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Cancer Cell Int,Cancer cell international,101139795,,,,2002/06/22 10:00,2002/06/22 10:01,['2002/06/22 10:00'],"['2001/11/07 00:00 [received]', '2002/05/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/06/22 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/06/22 10:01 [medline]', '2002/06/22 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1186/1475-2867-2-4 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Cell Int. 2002 May 17;2(1):4. doi: 10.1186/1475-2867-2-4.,,,PMC116434,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pretreatment of reagent platelets with enzymes was investigated to determine whether the sensitivity of the assay could be increased. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: SPRCA testing, following the manufacturer's directions, was performed on 51 sera from patients with either a positive SPRCA antibody screen, suboptimal clinical responses to platelet transfusions, and/or suspected immune thrombocytopenic purpura; testing was also performed following pretreatment of the reagent platelets with bromelin, papain, or ficin. Sera from 23 patients having negative routine SPRCA antibody screens and good clinical responses to transfusion were tested as controls. Lymphocytotoxic antibody testing was also performed on selected samples. The effectiveness of enzyme treatment was judged by the increase in the proportion of reagent platelets reacting with the sample and the observed reaction strengths. RESULTS: Pretreatments of reagent platelets with all three enzymes increased the reactivity of known antibodies and detected some HLA and platelet-specific antibodies that had not reacted in routine testing. The clinical significance of the antibody specificities detected only after enzyme pretreatment was verified by a correlation with results from transfusing antigen-negative units. Only occasional false-positive results after enzyme pretreatment were observed. CONCLUSIONS: The use of enzyme pretreatment of SPRCA screening strips can provide information that is useful in selecting appropriate units for transfusion.","['Leach, Miriam Fogg', 'AuBuchon, James P']","['Leach MF', 'AuBuchon JP']","['Transfusion Service Laboratory, Department of Pathology, Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, Lebanon, New Hampshire 03756, USA. miriam.k.leach@hitchcock.org']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Transfusion,Transfusion,0417360,"['0 (Autoantibodies)', '0 (Enzymes)', '0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (Indicators and Reagents)', '0 (Isoantibodies)', '0 (Platelet Glycoprotein GPIIb-IIIa Complex)', '9001-00-7 (Bromelains)', 'EC 3.4.22.2 (Papain)', 'EC 3.4.22.3 (Ficain)']",IM,"['Antibody Specificity', 'Autoantibodies/*blood', 'Blood Platelets/drug effects/*immunology', 'Bromelains/pharmacology', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Enzymes/*pharmacology', 'Erythrocytes/*immunology', 'Female', 'Ficain/pharmacology', 'HLA Antigens/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Indicators and Reagents', 'Isoantibodies/*blood', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Papain/pharmacology', 'Platelet Glycoprotein GPIIb-IIIa Complex/immunology', 'Platelet Transfusion', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",2002/06/22 10:00,2002/07/13 10:01,['2002/06/22 10:00'],"['2002/06/22 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/07/13 10:01 [medline]', '2002/06/22 10:00 [entrez]']","['trf083 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1525-1438.2002.00083.x [doi]']",ppublish,Transfusion. 2002 Apr;42(4):476-80. doi: 10.1046/j.1525-1438.2002.00083.x.,,,,['Transfusion. 2003 Jun;43(6):835; author reply 835.

The deduced protein, containing seven putative transmembrane segments and sharing 75.8% amino acid identity with mouse Myadm protein, was named as human MYADM. The results of Northern blot analysis showed that MYADM was ubiquitously expressed in 15 of 16 adult tissues tested, except thymus. To determine whether the novel human gene was involved in hematopoietic differentiation process as mouse Myadm did, we examined the mRNA expressive abundance of this gene between normal bone marrow cells and peripheral blood leukocytes, and detected the expression change in NB4 cells induced by all-trans retinoic acid at different induce time by the semi-quantitative RT-PCR. The results showed that the expression of the novel gene was not only significantly higher in peripheral blood leukocytes than in bone marrow cells, but also significantly up-regulated when the NB4 cells(derived from a patient with acute promyelocytic leukemia) were induced by all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) for 48hr. It is suggested that human MYADM was also associated with the differentiation of hematopoietic cells or acute promyelocytic leukemia cells.

This study investigates its specificity, sensitivity and potential clinical usefulness. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Parallel analysis of Q-Rt-PCR and the conventional reverse transcription-mediated PCR (RT-PCR) were performed on 567 samples from 481 patients. Treatment response was monitored by Q-Rt-PCR at 6 and 12 months of 61 patients on STI-571 and 103 patients on interferon. RESULTS: The concordance rate between Q-Rt-PCR and RT-PCR was 96.3% (546/567), with 341 positives and 205 negatives. The positive equivalents ranged from 2 x 10(-6) to 1.2 microg of K562 cell RNA. Karyotyping in 372 samples revealed excellent correlation with Q-Rt-PCR measurements (P < 0.001). Setting residual BCR/abl < 0.01 as an early goal of molecular response, we observed that STI-571 induced a better response than interferon: 49% (20 of 41 patients) versus 35% (15 of 62 patients) at 6 months (P = 0.025) and 52% (32 of 61 patients) versus 34% (35 of 103 patients) at 12 months (P = 0.01), respectively.

A tentative diagnosis of monoblastic leukemia was established by microscopic examination of Romanowsky-stained blood smears and bone marrow aspirate smears. This diagnosis also was supported by the light scatter signature that identified the blast cells as large, non-granular monocytic cells using a CellDyn 3500 automated hematology analyzer; as well as by the detection of N-butyrate esterase and the lack of choloroacetate esterase or leukocyte peroxidase by cytochemical staining. Subsequently, leukemic cells were isolated from the dog's peripheral blood and placed into tissue culture or cryopreserved. The leukemic cells grew in suspension cultures and proliferated spontaneously for up to 4 days. By day 7, proliferation was negligible. Upon culture with conditioned supernatant using mitogen-stimulated human T cells as a source of cytokines, an increased proportion of cells entered S phase by day 2 of culture; however, proliferation declined markedly by day 4, at which time the cells had apparently differentiated to adherent, vacuolated macrophages. The cytokine-stimulated leukemic cells were positive for the monocyte/macrophage specific markers alpha-1-antitrypsin, alpha-1-antichymotrypsin, lysozyme, CD14, MHC class II, and calprotectin, an antigen found in differentiated macrophages and granulocytes. Despite the strong tendency of the leukemic cells towards monocytic differentiation, our results suggested that they retained some features of a myelomonocytic precursor. These data show that cytochemistry, immunophenotyping, flow cytometry, and in vitro differentiation of canine leukemia cells are useful tools for confirming the lineage of malignant hematopoietic cells.","['Modiano, Jaime F.', 'Smith, Roger 3rd', 'Wojcieszyn, John', 'Thomas, Jennifer S.', 'Rosenbaum, Betty A.', 'Ball, Carrie', 'Nicholds, Elaine A.', 'Anthony, Margaret A.', 'Barton, Claudia L.']","['Modiano JF', 'Smith R 3rd', 'Wojcieszyn J', 'Thomas JS', 'Rosenbaum BA', 'Ball C', 'Nicholds EA', 'Anthony MA', 'Barton CL']","['Department of Veterinary Pathobiology, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX 77843, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Vet Clin Pathol,Veterinary clinical pathology,9880575,,,,2002/06/21 10:00,2002/06/21 10:01,['2002/06/21 10:00'],"['2002/06/21 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/06/21 10:01 [medline]', '2002/06/21 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1939-165x.1998.tb01014.x [doi]'],ppublish,Vet Clin Pathol. 1998;27(2):40-49. doi: 10.1111/j.1939-165x.1998.tb01014.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Protein pp71 stimulates expression from a range of promoters in a sequence-independent manner, and in this respect behaves similarly to the herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) IE protein ICP0. The intracellular localization of pp71 was investigated after its expression from transfected plasmids or from HSV-1 mutants constructed to produce pp71 transiently. The protein colocalized with the cell promyelocytic leukaemia (PML) protein at nuclear domain 10 (ND10) structures but, unlike ICP0, pp71 did not induce disruption of ND10. The activity of pp71 in mouse sensory neurons in vivo was investigated after co-inoculation of animals with pairs of HSV-1 mutants, one expressing pp71 and the second containing the E. coli lacZ gene controlled by various promoters. In this system, pp71 stimulated beta-galactosidase expression from a range of viral IE promoters when mice were analysed at 4 days postinoculation. At later times, expression of pp71 resulted in a reduction in numbers of neurons containing beta-galactosidase, indicating cytotoxicity or promoter shutoff. The HSV-1 latency-active promoter was not responsive to pp71, demonstrating specificity in the activity of the protein. Pp71 was as active in mice lacking both copies of the PML gene (PML-/-) as in control animals, and in PML-/- fibroblasts pp71 stimulated gene expression as effectively as in other cell types. Therefore, neither the PML protein nor the normal ND10 structure is necessary for pp71 to stimulate gene expression.","['Marshall, Ker R', 'Rowley, Kate V', 'Rinaldi, Angela', 'Nicholson, Iain P', 'Ishov, Alexander M', 'Maul, Gerd G', 'Preston, Chris M']","['Marshall KR', 'Rowley KV', 'Rinaldi A', 'Nicholson IP', 'Ishov AM', 'Maul GG', 'Preston CM']","['Medical Research Council Virology Unit, Church Street, Glasgow G11 5JR, UK1.', 'Medical Research Council Virology Unit, Church Street, Glasgow G11 5JR, UK1.', 'Medical Research Council Virology Unit, Church Street, Glasgow G11 5JR, UK1.', 'Medical Research Council Virology Unit, Church Street, Glasgow G11 5JR, UK1.', 'The Wistar Institute, 3601 Spruce Street, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA2.', 'The Wistar Institute, 3601 Spruce Street, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA2.', 'Medical Research Council Virology Unit, Church Street, Glasgow G11 5JR, UK1.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,J Gen Virol,The Journal of general virology,0077340,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Pml protein, mouse)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '107852-97-1 (cytomegalovirus phosphoprotein 71kDa)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.1.23 (beta-Galactosidase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Cytomegalovirus/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Genes, Immediate-Early', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Herpesvirus 1, Human/genetics', 'Humans', 'Lac Operon', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Neoplasm Proteins/deficiency/genetics', 'Neurons/metabolism', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Plasmids', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Transcription Factors/deficiency/genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Vero Cells/metabolism', 'Viral Proteins/analysis/*metabolism', 'beta-Galactosidase/metabolism']",2002/06/21 10:00,2002/09/11 10:01,['2002/06/21 10:00'],"['2002/06/21 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/11 10:01 [medline]', '2002/06/21 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1099/0022-1317-83-7-1601 [doi]'],ppublish,J Gen Virol. 2002 Jul;83(Pt 7):1601-1612. doi: 10.1099/0022-1317-83-7-1601.,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1099/0022-1317-83-7-1601 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We used the gene-expression profiles of these lymphomas to develop a molecular predictor of survival. METHODS: Biopsy samples of diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma from 240 patients were examined for gene expression with the use of DNA microarrays and analyzed for genomic abnormalities. Subgroups with distinctive gene-expression profiles were defined on the basis of hierarchical clustering. A molecular predictor of risk was constructed with the use of genes with expression patterns that were associated with survival in a preliminary group of 160 patients and was then tested in a validation group of 80 patients. The accuracy of this predictor was compared with that of the international prognostic index. RESULTS: Three gene-expression subgroups--germinal-center B-cell-like, activated B-cell-like, and type 3 diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma--were identified. Two common oncogenic events in diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma, bcl-2 translocation and c-rel amplification, were detected only in the germinal-center B-cell-like subgroup. Patients in this subgroup had the highest five-year survival rate. To identify other molecular determinants of outcome, we searched for individual genes with expression patterns that correlated with survival in the preliminary group of patients. Most of these genes fell within four gene-expression signatures characteristic of germinal-center B cells, proliferating cells, reactive stromal and immune cells in the lymph node, or major-histocompatibility-complex class II complex. We used 17 genes to construct a predictor of overall survival after chemotherapy. This gene-based predictor and the international prognostic index were independent prognostic indicators. CONCLUSIONS: DNA microarrays can be used to formulate a molecular predictor of survival after chemotherapy for diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma.","['Rosenwald, Andreas', 'Wright, George', 'Chan, Wing C', 'Connors, Joseph M', 'Campo, Elias', 'Fisher, Richard I', 'Gascoyne, Randy D', 'Muller-Hermelink, H Konrad', 'Smeland, Erlend B', 'Giltnane, Jena M', 'Hurt, Elaine M', 'Zhao, Hong', 'Averett, Lauren', 'Yang, Liming', 'Wilson, Wyndham H', 'Jaffe, Elaine S', 'Simon, Richard', 'Klausner, Richard D', 'Powell, John', 'Duffey, Patricia L', 'Longo, Dan L', 'Greiner, Timothy C', 'Weisenburger, Dennis D', 'Sanger, Warren G', 'Dave, Bhavana J', 'Lynch, James C', 'Vose, Julie', 'Armitage, James O', 'Montserrat, Emilio', 'Lopez-Guillermo, Armando', 'Grogan, Thomas M', 'Miller, Thomas P', 'LeBlanc, Michel', 'Ott, German', 'Kvaloy, Stein', 'Delabie, Jan', 'Holte, Harald', 'Krajci, Peter', 'Stokke, Trond', 'Staudt, Louis M']","['Rosenwald A', 'Wright G', 'Chan WC', 'Connors JM', 'Campo E', 'Fisher RI', 'Gascoyne RD', 'Muller-Hermelink HK', 'Smeland EB', 'Giltnane JM', 'Hurt EM', 'Zhao H', 'Averett L', 'Yang L', 'Wilson WH', 'Jaffe ES', 'Simon R', 'Klausner RD', 'Powell J', 'Duffey PL', 'Longo DL', 'Greiner TC', 'Weisenburger DD', 'Sanger WG', 'Dave BJ', 'Lynch JC', 'Vose J', 'Armitage JO', 'Montserrat E', 'Lopez-Guillermo A', 'Grogan TM', 'Miller TP', 'LeBlanc M', 'Ott G', 'Kvaloy S', 'Delabie J', 'Holte H', 'Krajci P', 'Stokke T', 'Staudt LM']","['Metabolism Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md 20892, USA.']",['eng'],['UO1-CA84967/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,N Engl J Med,The New England journal of medicine,0255562,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)']",IM,"['Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Biopsy', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/drug therapy/*genetics/*mortality/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/drug therapy/*genetics/*mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis']",2002/06/21 10:00,2002/06/26 10:01,['2002/06/21 10:00'],"['2002/06/21 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/06/26 10:01 [medline]', '2002/06/21 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1056/NEJMoa012914 [doi]', '346/25/1937 [pii]']",ppublish,N Engl J Med. 2002 Jun 20;346(25):1937-47. doi: 10.1056/NEJMoa012914.,,,,"['N Engl J Med. 2002 Jun 20;346(25):1998-9.

We have now tested this hypothesis by comparing the frequency of children with leukaemia (n = 982) who typed for specific DPB1 alleles and two groups of non-leukaemic children, one consisting of children with solid tumours, excluding lymphomas (n = 409), the other consisting of normal infants (n = 864). We found that significantly more children with c-ALL and T-ALL, but not pro-B ALL or acute non-ALL typed for DPB1*0201 as compared with children with solid tumours [odds ratio (OR), 95% confidence interval (CI) for c-ALL: 1.76, 1.20-2.56; T-ALL: 1.93, 1.01-3.80] and normal infants (OR, 95% CI for c-ALL: 1.83, 1.34-2.48; T-ALL: 2.00, 1.10-3.82). In childhood c-ALL, significantly more children than those with solid tumours or normal infants typed for DPB1 alleles coding specific polymorphic amino acids lining the antigen-binding site of the DPbeta1*0201 allotypic protein, suggesting that susceptibility to childhood c-ALL may be influenced by DPbeta ABS amino acid polymorphisms shared by DPbeta1*0201 and other DPbeta1 allotypes. These results point to a mechanism of c-ALL susceptibility that involves the presentation of specific antigenic peptides, possibly derived from infectious agents, by DPbeta1*0201-related allotypic proteins, leading to the activation of helper T cells mediating proliferative stress on preleukaemic cells.","['Taylor, G Malcolm', 'Dearden, Simon', 'Ravetto, Paul', 'Ayres, Michelle', 'Watson, Pamela', 'Hussain, Adiba', 'Greaves, Mel', 'Alexander, Freda', 'Eden, Osborn B']","['Taylor GM', 'Dearden S', 'Ravetto P', 'Ayres M', 'Watson P', 'Hussain A', 'Greaves M', 'Alexander F', 'Eden OB']","[""Immunogenetics Laboratory, St Mary's Hospital, Manchester M13 0JH, UK. gmtaylor@man.ac.uk""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Hum Mol Genet,Human molecular genetics,9208958,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (HLA-DRB1 Chains)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (TEL-AML1 fusion protein)']",IM,"['Binding Sites', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'Diploidy', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'HLA-DR Antigens/*genetics/metabolism', 'HLA-DRB1 Chains', 'Heterozygote', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/genetics', 'Male', 'Models, Genetic', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/metabolism', 'Peptides/metabolism', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Reference Values']",2002/06/21 10:00,2003/06/17 05:00,['2002/06/21 10:00'],"['2002/06/21 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/17 05:00 [medline]', '2002/06/21 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/hmg/11.14.1585 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Mol Genet. 2002 Jul 1;11(14):1585-97. doi: 10.1093/hmg/11.14.1585.,,,,,,['UKCCS Investigators.

The data are presented in a comparable way to previous publications of infections with HHV-6 and HIV (which target the same CD4+ cell for infection) to be used for computer validation studies. After initial infection, HTLV-1 remains clinically latent for many years at low provirus copy numbers in CD4 cells. Once immune surveillance deteriorates and viral replication progresses, provirus copy numbers increase rapidly. Unlike other virus infections, apoptotic death of virus-infected ""atypical"" lymphocytes decreases with increasing viral load, thus favoring continued proliferation of these cells and further virus replication at the same time. Changes in the peripheral blood are characterized by coincident rises in oligoclonal lymphocyte populations including HTLV-1-positive CD4+ T-lymphocytes and their precursors with a progressive shift to immature cells as disease progresses. The pathogenesis of HTLV-1-induced adult T-cell leukemia is an example of dysregulative leukemogenesis ideal for validation of respective computer simulation models.","['Krueger, Gerhard R F', 'Brandt, Michael E', 'Wang, Guanyu', 'Buja, L Maximilian']","['Krueger GR', 'Brandt ME', 'Wang G', 'Buja LM']","['Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine, UT-Houston Medical School, 6431 Fannin St., MSB 2.246, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.

The HIV-1 vectors consistently expressed 3 to 10 times higher activity than the MLV vectors at both the RNA and protein levels. The difference was not attributable to transcriptional interference, alternative enhancer/silencer, or differential EF1alpha intron splicing. Based on nuclear run-on assays, both vectors exhibited similar EF1alpha transcriptional activity. The reduced RNA levels of MLV vectors could not be explained by the decrease in RNA half-lives. Southern analysis of proviral DNA indicated that both HIV-1 and MLV vectors efficiently propagated the EF1alpha intron in the transduced cells. To decipher the discrepancy in transgene expression between MLV and HIV-1 vectors, the role of RNA 3'-end processing was examined using a sensitive Cre/lox reporter assay. The results showed that MLV vectors, but not HIV-1 vectors, displayed high frequencies of readthrough of the 3' polyadenylation signal. Interestingly, the polyadenylation signal of a self-inactivating (SIN) HIV-1 vector was as leaky as that of the MLV vectors, suggesting a potential risk of oncogene activation by the lentiviral SIN vectors. Together, our results suggest that an efficient polyadenylation signal would improve both the efficacy and the safety of these vectors.","['Zaiss, Anne-Kathrin', 'Son, Sodany', 'Chang, Lung-Ji']","['Zaiss AK', 'Son S', 'Chang LJ']","['Department of Molecular Genetics and Microbiology, Powell Gene Therapy Center and McKnight Brain Institute, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida 32610-0266, USA.']",['eng'],"['P01 HL059412/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 HL059412/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-59412/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Comparative Study', 'Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Peptide Elongation Factor 1)', '0 (RNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Genes, Reporter', '*Genetic Vectors', 'HIV-1/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Introns', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Peptide Elongation Factor 1/genetics/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', ""*RNA 3' End Processing"", 'RNA, Viral/genetics/metabolism', 'Safety', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Transfection', 'Transgenes']",2002/06/20 10:00,2002/07/26 10:01,['2002/06/20 10:00'],"['2002/06/20 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/07/26 10:01 [medline]', '2002/06/20 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/jvi.76.14.7209-7219.2002 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2002 Jul;76(14):7209-19. doi: 10.1128/jvi.76.14.7209-7219.2002.,,,PMC136337,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite the apparent transforming ability of HTLV-1 under experimental conditions, most HTLV-1 carriers are asymptomatic. These facts suggest that HTLV-1 is controlled by host immunity in most carriers. To understand the interplay between host immunity and HTLV-1-infected cells, in this study, we isolated several HTLV-1 Tax-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) lines from rats inoculated with Tax-coding DNA and investigated the long-term effects of the CTL on syngeneic HTLV-1-infected T cells. Our results demonstrated that long-term mixed culture of these CTL and the virus-infected T cells led to the emergence of CTL-resistant HTLV-1-infected cells. Although the Tax expression level in these resistant cells was equivalent to that in the parental cells, expression of surface major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) was significantly downregulated in the resistant cells. Downregulation of MHC-I was more apparent in RT1.A(l), which presents a Tax epitope recognized by the CTL established in this study. Moreover, peptide pulsing resulted in killing of the resistant cells by CTL, indicating that resistance was caused by a decreased epitope density on the infected cell surface. This may be one of the mechanisms for persistence of HTLV-1-infected cells that evade CTL lysis and potentially develop ATL.","['Ohashi, Takashi', 'Hanabuchi, Shino', 'Suzuki, Reiko', 'Kato, Hirotomo', 'Masuda, Takao', 'Kannagi, Mari']","['Ohashi T', 'Hanabuchi S', 'Suzuki R', 'Kato H', 'Masuda T', 'Kannagi M']","['Department of Immunotherapeutics, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Medical and Dental Research Division, Tokyo 113-8519, Japan. toha.impt@tmd.ac.jp']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Deltaretrovirus Infections/*immunology/virology', 'Disease Models, Animal', '*Down-Regulation', 'Epitopes', 'Female', 'Gene Products, tax/immunology', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/*metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/immunology', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred F344', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/*virology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology']",2002/06/20 10:00,2002/07/26 10:01,['2002/06/20 10:00'],"['2002/06/20 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/07/26 10:01 [medline]', '2002/06/20 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/jvi.76.14.7010-7019.2002 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2002 Jul;76(14):7010-9. doi: 10.1128/jvi.76.14.7010-7019.2002.,,,PMC136333,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We now show that this is due to inhibition of virus attachment independent of the interaction between viral envelope proteins (Env) and their cellular receptors. Heparin blocked the binding of both Env-deficient and amphotropic MLV (MLV-A) particles to NIH 3T3 fibroblasts, CHO cells which lack the amphotropic retroviral receptor Pit-2, and CHO cells transfected with Pit-2 (CHO-Pit-2). Heparin also inhibited the transduction of NIH 3T3 cells by MLV-A over a similar concentration range. This effect was observed within 15 min of exposure to retrovirus. Preloading target cells with heparin had no effect on transduction and both MLV-A and Env-deficient retrovirus bound efficiently to heparin-coated agarose beads, suggesting that heparin interacts with the virus rather than the target cell. This requires both a strong negative charge and a specific structure since GAGs with different charge and carbohydrate composition inhibited virus infection variably. The specificity of GAG-virus interaction also depends on the producer cells, since virus packaged by murine GP+EnvAM12 cells was 1,000-fold more sensitive to inhibition by chondroitin sulfate A than was virus packaged by human FLYA13 packaging cells. No evidence for an interaction between MLV and cell surface proteoglycans was found, however, since the attachment of MLV-A and envelope-defective virus to proteoglycan-deficient CHOpgsA-745 cells was similar to that seen with both wild-type and CHO-Pit-2 cells. Although the molecular mechanism is unclear, this study presents evidence that Env receptor-independent attachment is an important step in MLV infection.","['Walker, Simon J', 'Pizzato, Massimo', 'Takeuchi, Yasuhiro', 'Devereux, Stephen']","['Walker SJ', 'Pizzato M', 'Takeuchi Y', 'Devereux S']","['Department of Haematology, University College, London, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (Glycosaminoglycans)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '9005-49-6 (Heparin)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'CHO Cells', 'Cricetinae', 'Gene Products, env/genetics/*metabolism', 'Glycosaminoglycans/metabolism', 'Heparin/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics/*pathogenicity/physiology', 'Mice', 'Receptors, Virus/*metabolism', 'Transduction, Genetic']",2002/06/20 10:00,2002/07/26 10:01,['2002/06/20 10:00'],"['2002/06/20 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/07/26 10:01 [medline]', '2002/06/20 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/jvi.76.14.6909-6918.2002 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2002 Jul;76(14):6909-18. doi: 10.1128/jvi.76.14.6909-6918.2002.,,,PMC136325,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A preliminary peport.,140-5,"BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to predict chemotherapy response in untreated malignant lymphomas using technetium-99m methoxyisobutylisonitrile (Tc-MIBI) scan. METHODS: Twenty-five patients with malignant lymphoma were studied before receiving chemotherapy. Early Tc-MIBI scan was performed 10 min after intravenous injection of Tc-MIBI. Immunohistochemical analyses were performed on multiple non-consecutive sections of the biopsy specimens to determine Pgp expression. Chemotherapy response was evaluated in the first 1-2 years after completion of treatment by clinical and radiological methods. RESULTS: The mean tumor-to-background ratio of the 15 patients with good response (3.3 +/- 0.6) was significantly higher than that of the 10 patients with poor response (1.2 +/- 0.1). Among the 15 patients with good response to chemotherapy, all had positive Tc-MIBI scan results but negative Pgp expression. Among the 10 patients who had poor response to chemotherapy, all 10 had negative Tc-MIBI scan, but six patients had positive Pgp expression and four had negative Pgp expression. Significant differences were found in the incidences of good and poor responses determined by Tc-MIBI scan and Pgp expression. However, there were no significant differences in the incidences of good and poor responses for other prognostic factors. CONCLUSION: Compared with other prognostic factors, early Tc-MIBI scan more accurately predicts chemotherapy response in patients with malignant lymphoma.","['Liang, Ji-An', 'Shiau, Yu-Chien', 'Yang, Shih-Neng', 'Lin, Fang-Jen', 'Kao, Albert', 'Lee, Cheng-Chun']","['Liang JA', 'Shiau YC', 'Yang SN', 'Lin FJ', 'Kao A', 'Lee CC']","['Department of Radiation Therapy and Oncology, China Medical College Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Jpn J Clin Oncol,Japanese journal of clinical oncology,0313225,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Radiopharmaceuticals)', '971Z4W1S09 (Technetium Tc 99m Sestamibi)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/analysis/*biosynthesis', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/diagnostic imaging/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Lymphoma/*diagnostic imaging/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', '*Radiopharmaceuticals', '*Technetium Tc 99m Sestamibi', 'Tomography, Emission-Computed, Single-Photon']",2002/06/20 10:00,2002/06/27 10:01,['2002/06/20 10:00'],"['2002/06/20 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/06/27 10:01 [medline]', '2002/06/20 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/jjco/hyf027 [doi]'],ppublish,Jpn J Clin Oncol. 2002 Apr;32(4):140-5. doi: 10.1093/jjco/hyf027.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On target cells lacking intrinsic expression of specific receptor alpha subunits cytokines of the IL-6 family only act in the presence of their specific agonistic soluble receptors. Here, we report the construction and expression of a CNTF/soluble CNTF-receptor (sCNTF-R) fusion protein (Hyper-CNTF) with enhanced biological activity on cells expressing gp130 and leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIF-R), but not membrane-bound CNTF-R. At the cDNA level, the C-terminus of the extracellular domain of human CNTF-R (amino acids 1-346) was linked via a single glycine residue to the N-terminus of human CNTF (amino acids 1-186). Recombinant Hyper-CNTF protein was expressed in COS-7 cells. Hyper-CNTF efficiently induced dose-dependent STAT3 phosphorylation and proliferation of BAF-3 cells stably transfected with gp130 and LIF-R cDNAs. While on BAF3/gp130/LIF-R cells, Hyper-CNTF and LIF exhibited similar biological responses, the activity of Hyper-CNTF on pheochromocytoma cells (PC12 cells) was quite distinct from that of LIF. In contrast to LIF, Hyper-CNTF stimulated neurite outgrowth of PC12 cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner correlating with the ability to phosphorylate MAP kinases. These data indicate that although LIF and Hyper-CNTF use the same heterodimeric receptor complex of gp130 and LIFR, only Hyper-CNTF induces neuronal differentiation. The therapeutic potential of Hyper-CNTF as a superagonistic neurotrophin is discussed.","['Marz, Pia', 'Ozbek, Suat', 'Fischer, Martina', 'Voltz, Nicole', 'Otten, Uwe', 'Rose-John, Stefan']","['Marz P', 'Ozbek S', 'Fischer M', 'Voltz N', 'Otten U', 'Rose-John S']","['Department of Physiology, University of Basel, Switzerland. p.maerz@unibas.ch']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Biochem,European journal of biochemistry,0107600,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Il6st protein, mouse)', '0 (Il6st protein, rat)', '0 (LIFR protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lifr protein, mouse)', '0 (Lifr protein, rat)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Protein Subunits)', '0 (Receptor, Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Stat3 protein, rat)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD/*metabolism', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/physiology', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor/genetics/*pharmacology', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'PC12 Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Protein Subunits', 'Rats', 'Receptor, Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Cytokine/*metabolism', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/pharmacology', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'Trans-Activators/*metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/06/20 10:00,2002/08/20 10:01,['2002/06/20 10:00'],"['2002/06/20 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/20 10:01 [medline]', '2002/06/20 10:00 [entrez]']","['2977 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1432-1033.2002.02977.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Biochem. 2002 Jun;269(12):3023-31. doi: 10.1046/j.1432-1033.2002.02977.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Forty-four patients with de novo MD-AML were treated with the FLAG regimen. The median age was 61 yr (range 31-75 yr). Induction therapy consisted of the FLAG regimen; consolidation included idarubicin plus cytarabine. Patients with a compatible donor and aged less than 55 yr were programmed to receive allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT), while in those without a donor and aged less than 65 yr autologous transplantation with peripheral blood stem cells mobilized by a consolidation regimen plus G-CSF was planned. Bone marrow harvest was performed in poor mobilizers. RESULTS: Complete remission (CR) was achieved in 28 out of 44 patients (64%). Death in induction occurred in four patients (9%), while 12 patients (27%) were resistant to FLAG. Toxicity of consolidation was negligible. Most patients aged less than 60 yr and achieving CR were eligible for transplantation procedures, the main reason of exclusion being early relapse. Median overall survival and disease free survival were 16 and 22 months, respectively. Unfavorable cytogenetics was the only parameter significantly related to inferior clinical outcome following multivariate analysis. CONCLUSION: Multilineage dysplasia per se is not an adverse prognostic factor in AML patients treated with the FLAG regimen. Favorable results are obtained in patients with intermediate karyotype, while in those with adverse cytogenetics new approaches are clearly needed. The toxicity of the regimen is also acceptable in the elderly, and following induction/consolidation, most patients may be submitted to transplantation procedures.","['Ferrara, Felicetto', 'Palmieri, Salvatore', 'Pocali, Barbara', 'Pollio, Filiberto', 'Viola, Assunta', 'Annunziata, Silvana', 'Sebastio, Lucia', 'Schiavone, Ettore Mariano', 'Mele, Giuseppina', 'Gianfaldoni, Giacomo', 'Leoni, Franco']","['Ferrara F', 'Palmieri S', 'Pocali B', 'Pollio F', 'Viola A', 'Annunziata S', 'Sebastio L', 'Schiavone EM', 'Mele G', 'Gianfaldoni G', 'Leoni F']","['Hematology Division, A.O.R.N.

To examine the etiology of SCL and the influence of chromosomal instability on leukemogenesis, 12 SCLs and two AMLs arising from Trp53-deficient C3H/He mice were investigated cytogenetically. Each SCL demonstrated cell-to-cell variation in the number and structural integrity of their chromosomes, indicating chromosomal instability. Typical deletion of chromosome 2 was observed in the two AML cases, while most SCL cells did not display this aberration. Deletions and rearrangements of chromosome 11 were noticeable in SCLs from Trp53 heterozygotes but not in AMLs. Analysis of loss of heterozygosity revealed that aberrations involving chromosome 11 in SCLs resulted in loss of the wild-type Trp53 allele. These results suggest that loss of Trp53 function triggers the tumorigenic process leading toward SCL through the induction of chromosomal instability, and that SCL and AML are distinct varieties of leukemia.","['Ban, Nobuhiko', 'Yoshida, Kazuko', 'Aizawa, Shiro', 'Wada, Sachiko', 'Kai, Michiaki']","['Ban N', 'Yoshida K', 'Aizawa S', 'Wada S', 'Kai M']","['Oita University of Nursing and Health Sciences, 2944-9 Megusuno, Notsuharu, Oita-gun, Oita 870-1201, Japan. ban@oita-nhs.ac.jp']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Radiat Res,Radiation research,0401245,['0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Alleles', 'Animals', 'Chromosomes/radiation effects', 'Female', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/*pathology', 'Loss of Heterozygosity/radiation effects', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*genetics', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",2002/06/20 10:00,2002/08/23 10:01,['2002/06/20 10:00'],"['2002/06/20 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/23 10:01 [medline]', '2002/06/20 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1667/0033-7587(2002)158[0069:caoril]2.0.co;2 [doi]'],ppublish,Radiat Res. 2002 Jul;158(1):69-77. doi: 10.1667/0033-7587(2002)158[0069:caoril]2.0.co;2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report a similar case of a patient with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, who developed ARF from spontaneous ATLS. ARF can complicate the clinical course of spontaneous ATLS. Since only one patient survived, patients who develop ARF from spontaneous ATLS have a poor outcome. This paper illustrates the need to anticipate the development of ARF, despite aggressive therapy, in a patient with spontaneous ATLS.

Carter et al. (1982, Cancer Research 42, 2963-2971) show that confidence regions for optimal conditions provide a way to make decisions about therapeutic synergism. The response surface may be constrained to be within a specified, bounded region. These constraint regions can be quite general. This allows for more realistic constraint modeling and a wide degree of applicability, including constraints occurring in mixture experiments. The usual assumption of a quadratic model is also generalized to include any regression model that is linear in the model parameters. An intimate connection is established between this confidence region and the Box-Hunter (1954, Biometrika 41, 190-199) confidence region for a stationary point. As a byproduct, this methodology also provides a way to construct a confidence interval for the difference between the optimal mean response and the mean response at a specified factor-level configuration. The application of this confidence region is illustrated with two examples. Extensive simulations indicate that this confidence region has good coverage properties.","['Peterson, John J', 'Cahya, Suntara', 'del Castillo, Enrique']","['Peterson JJ', 'Cahya S', 'del Castillo E']","['Statistical Sciences Department, GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals, King of Prussia, Pennsylvania 19406, USA.

One normal equine lymph node was also examined for ER and PR expression. All of the cases of equine lymphoma and the normal lymph node were negative for Er. A total of 16/29 (55%) PR-positive lymphomas were identified.

One case involving abdominal and thoracic tumors and leukemia was negative for PR expression. The normal lymph node contained a low percentage (1.9%) of PR-positive lymphocytes. The presence of PR in neoplastic equine lymphoid tissue indicates that these tumors may be responsive to serum progesterone. Also, identification of PR-positive cells in the normal lymph node suggests that PR may be constitutively expressed in normal equine lymphocytes. Further studies are needed to quantify PR levels in normal and malignant equine lymphoid tissue and to determine the usefulness of either progestin or antiprogestin drugs in the management of equine lymphoma.","['Henson, Kristin L.', 'Alleman, A.

MATERIAL/METHODS: Blasts from 38 children with acute leukemia (31 with ALL and 7 with AML) were tested for apoptotic index (Annexin V) and intracellular pH (SNARF). Of the ALL patients, 9 were low risk, 7 medium risk, and 15 high risk. Among the AML patients, 1 was low risk and 6 were high risk. Follow-up ranged from 6 to 120 weeks (median 60 weeks). RESULTS: The mean spontaneous AI was 19 +/-16%. The pH of leukemic blasts before treatment varied between 6.6 and 7.9 (mean 7.2 +/- 0.5). For patients < 10 years old, the markers for good prognosis were a WBC count below 50 x 10(3)/microml, good response to prednisone therapy at day 8, and remission at or before day 33. Univariate analysis showed that pH < 7 had favorable prognostic significance. Overall, the probability of EFS for patients with pH < 7 was 1.0, as opposed to 0.49 for those with pH > 7 (p=0.049, n=36). The probability of EFS for patients with AI below the median was not significantly different from those with AI above the median (0.4 vs 1.0, NS). CONCLUSIONS: The assessment of intracellular pH in blasts may be an important prognosticator for ALL patients. Children with low spontaneous AI or high pH of leukemic blasts appear to have an unfavorable prognosis.","['Malinowska, Iwona', 'Stelmaszczyk-Emmel, Anna', 'Wasik, Maria', 'Rokicka-Milewska, Roma']","['Malinowska I', 'Stelmaszczyk-Emmel A', 'Wasik M', 'Rokicka-Milewska R']","['Department of Pediatrics, Hematology and Oncology, Medical University of Warsaw, Poland. iwonamal@interia.pl']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Med Sci Monit,Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research,9609063,,IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*pathology', 'Prognosis']",2002/06/19 10:00,2002/12/27 04:00,['2002/06/19 10:00'],"['2002/06/19 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/27 04:00 [medline]', '2002/06/19 10:00 [entrez]']",['1866 [pii]'],ppublish,Med Sci Monit. 2002 Jun;8(6):CR441-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A., Lanotte, M., and Chabot, G. G. (2001) Cancer Res. 61, 700-705). To better understand the mechanism of action of ATRA metabolites and isomers, we assessed their binding to retinoic acid receptors (RARs) and activation of RAR-mediated transcription via a retinoic acid response element (RARE). Competition binding experiments with tritiated ATRA showed that all metabolites could bind to RARs with variable affinity. For transactivation studies, COS-7 cells were cotransfected with RAR alpha, beta, or gamma expression vectors and the reporter plasmid RARE-tk-Luc, and the retinoid concentrations for half-maximal luciferase activity (EC(50)) were determined. All retinoids tested could activate the three RAR isotypes. The lowest EC(50) value for RAR alpha was with 9-cis-RA (13 nM), followed by 4-oxo-RA (33 nM), 5,6-epoxy-RA (77 nM), 13-cis-RA (124 nM), 18-OH-RA (162 nM), ATRA (169 nM), and 4-OH-RA (791 nM). For RAR beta, the EC(50) values increased as follows: 4-oxo-RA (8 nM), ATRA (9 nM), 18-OH-RA (14 nM), 5,6-epoxy-RA (35 nM), 13-cis-RA (47 nM), 4-OH-RA (64 nM), and 9-cis-RA (173 nM). For RAR gamma the EC(50) values were: ATRA (2 nM), 5,6-epoxy-RA (4 nM), 18-OH-RA (14 nM), 13-cis-RA (36 nM), 9-cis-RA (58 nM), 4-oxo-RA (89 nM), and 4-OH-RA (94 nM). By comparing the -fold induction of luciferase activity, all retinoids tested were equipotent at transactivating RARE-tk-Luc whatever the RAR considered. However, the best induction of the transcription was obtained for RAR alpha, which was 5-fold higher than for RAR beta and 10-fold higher than for RAR gamma. In conclusion, these data show that ATRA metabolites can bind to and activate the three RARs with variable relative affinity but with similar efficacy. These results suggest that ATRA metabolites may activate several signaling pathways and probably play an important role in cellular physiology and cancer therapy.","['Idres, Nadia', 'Marill, Julie', 'Flexor, Maria A', 'Chabot, Guy G']","['Idres N', 'Marill J', 'Flexor MA', 'Chabot GG']","[""INSERM UMR-496, Institut Universitaire d'Hematologie, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris 10, France.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '0 (retinoic acid receptor beta)', '0 (retinoic acid receptor gamma)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Binding, Competitive', 'COS Cells', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Isomerism', 'Kinetics', 'Molecular Structure', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Transcription, Genetic/*drug effects', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Transfection', 'Tretinoin/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology']",2002/06/19 10:00,2002/10/18 04:00,['2002/06/19 10:00'],"['2002/06/19 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/10/18 04:00 [medline]', '2002/06/19 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M205016200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(20)69997-5 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2002 Aug 30;277(35):31491-8. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M205016200.

They differ from conventional B (B-2) cells with respect to their phenotype and mitogenic responses and are often secretors of the natural polyreactive antibodies in the serum. The origin of B-1 cells remains controversial, and the relationship between B-1 cells and autoreactive B cells is unclear. Here, we compare the signaling pathways that are activated by the engagement of the B cell antigen receptor (BCR) in B-1 and B-2 cells. Stimulation of the BCR leads to the induced activation of the three major classes of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), ERK, JNK, and p38 MAPK, as well as the Akt kinase and the transcription factors nuclear factor of activated T cells (NF-AT) and NF-kappaB in B-2 cells. In contrast, B-1 cells have constitutive activation of ERK and NF-AT but exhibit delayed JNK and lack p38 MAPK and NF-kappaB induction upon BCR cross-linking. The lack of NF-kappaB activation in B-1 cells may be due to a lack of Akt activation in these cells. Furthermore, our study using specific inhibitors reveals that the extended survival of B-1 cells in culture is not due to the constitutive activation of ERK; nor is it due to Akt signaling or Bcl-x(L) up-regulation, since these are not induced in B-1 cells. The current findings of altered MAPK and NF-AT activation and lack of NF-kappaB induction in B-1 cells indicate that these cells have signaling properties similar to tolerant B cells that are chronically exposed to self-antigens. Indeed, BCR stimulation of B-1 cells does not lead to their full activation as indicated by their lack of maximal up-regulation of specific markers such as CD25, CD69, and CD86.","['Wong, Siew-Cheng', 'Chew, Weng-Keong', 'Tan, Joy En-Lin', 'Melendez, Alirio J', 'Francis, Florence', 'Lam, Kong-Peng']","['Wong SC', 'Chew WK', 'Tan JE', 'Melendez AJ', 'Francis F', 'Lam KP']","['Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology, 30 Medical Drive, Singapore 117609, Singapore.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (CD5 Antigens)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (NFATC Transcription Factors)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.4.- (Type C Phospholipases)', 'EC 3.1.4.3 (Phospholipase C gamma)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/*physiology', 'CD5 Antigens/*analysis', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*physiology', '*Immune Tolerance', 'Immunoglobulin M/physiology', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/analysis', 'Isoenzymes/metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'NFATC Transcription Factors', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Phospholipase C gamma', '*Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/*physiology', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Type C Phospholipases/metabolism']",2002/06/19 10:00,2002/09/24 06:00,['2002/06/19 10:00'],"['2002/06/19 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/24 06:00 [medline]', '2002/06/19 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M202460200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(20)70149-3 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2002 Aug 23;277(34):30707-15. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M202460200.

A partial sequence homology of the incomplete DJ(H) rearrangement with 1 of the 2 nonfunctional VDJ(H) rearrangements suggests that the doubling of chromosomes had occurred after this DJ(H) rearrangement and thus during early B-cell differentiation. The occurrence of the nondisjunction of chromosomes as well as ongoing rearrangement processes in utero were confirmed by the presence of all 3 IgH rearrangements in neonatal blood spots, providing the first evidence that hyperdiploidy formation is an early event in leukemogenesis in these leukemias.","['Panzer-Grumayer, E Renate', 'Fasching, Karin', 'Panzer, Simon', 'Hettinger, Klaudia', 'Schmitt, Klaus', 'Stockler-Ipsiroglu, Sylvia', 'Haas, Oskar A']","['Panzer-Grumayer ER', 'Fasching K', 'Panzer S', 'Hettinger K', 'Schmitt K', 'Stockler-Ipsiroglu S', 'Haas OA']","[""Children's Cancer Research Institute, St Anna Kinderspital, University of Vienna, Austria. panzer@ccri.univie.ac.at""]",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)'],IM,"['Age of Onset', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Karyotyping', 'Male', '*Polyploidy', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/etiology/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/etiology/*genetics']",2002/06/19 10:00,2002/07/27 10:01,['2002/06/19 10:00'],"['2002/06/19 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/07/27 10:01 [medline]', '2002/06/19 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-01-0144 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)60012-X [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2002 Jul 1;100(1):347-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-01-0144.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the 3-step pretargeting radioimmunotherapy protocol, HAT-SA (140 or 400 microg) was administered intravenously (i.v.) to bind to the interleukin 2 receptor alpha (IL-2R alpha; CD25)-expressing tumor cells. After 24 hours, 100 microg of a synthetic clearing agent was administered i.v. to remove unbound circulating HAT-SA conjugate from the circulation. Four hours later, (213)Bi-DOTA-biotin was administered i.v. for therapy. Tumor growth was significantly inhibited in 3 trials by using 250 microCi (9.25 MBq) of (213)Bi-DOTA-biotin with a pretargeting technique as monitored by serum levels of soluble IL-2R alpha and/or human beta-2-microglobulin (P <.05, t test) and by survival of tumor-bearing mice in the treatment groups (P <.02, log rank test) as compared with the control groups. No prolongation of survival was observed with a nonspecific antibody-SA conjugate or in the absence of the radionuclide. Additionally, no prolongation of survival resulted from administration of (213)Bi directly linked to intact HAT. Furthermore, there was no prolongation of survival when the beta-emitting radionuclide yttrium 90 instead of the alpha-emitting radionuclide (213)Bi was used. The pretargeting approach with (213)Bi inhibited tumor growth more effectively than did immunotherapy with unmodified HAT. The best results were obtained with combination therapy that involved (213)Bi-DOTA-biotin with a pretargeting technique supplemented by 4 weekly doses of HAT.

As MM cells proliferate slowly, it would seem essential to find means of preventing their growth and accumulation inside bone marrow. The present study used an antisense strategy to elucidate the respective roles of Bcl-2, Bcl-x(L), and Mcl-1 proteins in myeloma cell survival. Each antisense oligonucleotide (ASO; Bcl-2, Bcl-x(L), or Mcl-1 ASO) introduced into human myeloma cell lines by electroporation induced a marked reduction in the level of the corresponding protein. Mcl-1 ASO triggers an important decrease of viability in all myeloma cell lines tested and in 2 primary myeloma cells, whereas neither Bcl-2 nor Bcl-x(L) ASO affected the viability of myeloma cells. The decrease of cell viability induced by Mcl-1 ASO treatment was associated with an induction of apoptosis that occurred through the disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential Delta Psi m and the activation of executioner caspase-3. Furthermore, we have shown that interleukin 6 cannot prevent the Mcl-1 ASO-induced apoptosis. Finally, although Bcl-2 ASO treatment alone has no effect, it can sensitize myeloma cell lines to dexamethasone (Dex), whereas Bcl-x(L) ASO in combination with Dex still had no effect. As MM remains an incurable disease despite intensive chemotherapy, these results suggest that Mcl-1 antisense strategy rather than Bcl-2 antisense strategy could be of considerable importance in the treatment of MM.","['Derenne, Sophie', 'Monia, Brett', 'Dean, Nicholas M', 'Taylor, Jennifer K', 'Rapp, Marie-Josee', 'Harousseau, Jean-Luc', 'Bataille, Regis', 'Amiot, Martine']","['Derenne S', 'Monia B', 'Dean NM', 'Taylor JK', 'Rapp MJ', 'Harousseau JL', 'Bataille R', 'Amiot M']","['Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale Unite 463 Institut de Biologie, Nantes, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/pharmacology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/pathology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/*pharmacology', 'Plasmacytoma/*pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'bcl-X Protein']",2002/06/19 10:00,2002/07/27 10:01,['2002/06/19 10:00'],"['2002/06/19 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/07/27 10:01 [medline]', '2002/06/19 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood.v100.1.194 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)59991-6 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2002 Jul 1;100(1):194-9. doi: 10.1182/blood.v100.1.194.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We studied XSCID patients who have persistent defects in B-cell and/or combined B- and T-cell function despite having received T cell-depleted haploidentical BMT. We compared transduction of autologous B-cell lines and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor-mobilized peripheral CD34(+) cells from these patients using an MFGS retrovirus vector containing the gamma(c) gene IL2RG pseudotyped with amphotropic, gibbon ape leukemia virus, or RD114 envelopes.

GSTM1 and GSTT1 genotypes are polymorphic in humans, and the phenotypic absence of enzyme activity is caused by a homozygous inherited deletion of the gene. Previous, smaller studies of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) provided contrasting data on the role of the GST genotype in susceptibility and treatment outcomes. We analyzed GST genotypes in 710 children with ALL treated by the Children's Cancer Group. Frequencies were compared with those of normal controls, and outcomes were analyzed according to genotype. Comparisons of gene frequencies in ALL case and control patients showed similar frequencies (54% vs 53% GSTM1 null in whites, P =.9; 40% versus 32% in blacks, P =.45; 16% versus 15% GSTT1 null in whites, P =.8; 17% versus 28% in blacks, P =.3). ALL was not associated with the GSTM1-null genotype or the double-null genotype in blacks or whites, in contrast to previous reports. Stratification of cases by age at diagnosis, sex, white blood cell count at diagnosis, B or T lineage, or cytogenetics revealed no differences in genotype frequencies. Analysis of treatment outcomes showed no differences in outcome according to GST genotype; in particular, there were no differences in frequencies of relapse at any site. These data, representing a larger series than any reported previously, suggest that GST genotype does not affect etiology or outcome of childhood ALL.","['Davies, Stella M', 'Bhatia, Smita', 'Ross, Julie A', 'Kiffmeyer, William R', 'Gaynon, Paul S', 'Radloff, Gretchen A', 'Robison, Leslie L', 'Perentesis, John P']","['Davies SM', 'Bhatia S', 'Ross JA', 'Kiffmeyer WR', 'Gaynon PS', 'Radloff GA', 'Robison LL', 'Perentesis JP']","[""Children's Oncology Group, Arcadia, CA 91066-6012, USA. davie008@umn.edu""]",['eng'],"['5U10-CA 13539/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA02649/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA02971/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA03526/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA03750/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA03888/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA05436/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA07306/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA07431/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA10198/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA10382/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA11174/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA13539/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA13809/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA14560/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA17829/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA20320/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA26044/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA26126/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA26270/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA27678/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA28851/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA28882/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA29013/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA29314/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA36004/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA36015/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA42764/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease/*genetics', '*Genotype', 'Glutathione Transferase/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/enzymology/epidemiology/*genetics', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",2002/06/19 10:00,2002/07/27 10:01,['2002/06/19 10:00'],"['2002/06/19 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/07/27 10:01 [medline]', '2002/06/19 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood.v100.1.67 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)59974-6 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2002 Jul 1;100(1):67-71. doi: 10.1182/blood.v100.1.67.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To evaluate the distribution of FLT3-LM within biologic subgroups, we screened 1003 patients with AML at diagnosis for this mutation. FLT3-LM was found in 234 (23.5%) of all patients and thus is the most frequent mutation in AML described so far. Of all positive patients, 165 (70.5%) revealed a normal karyotype. Of the 69 patients with chromosome aberrations, 24 (34.8%) had a t(15;17). The mutation was rare in AML with t(8;21), inv(16) 11q23 rearrangements, and complex karyotypes. FLT3-LM was not distributed equally within different French-American-British (FAB) subtypes and was correlated with a high peripheral blood count in FAB M1, M2, and M4 (P <.0001). In addition, the median age of patients with the mutation was lower (54.9 vs 57.6 years; P =.043), and, at a ratio of 1.36:1 (P =.023), the mutation was more frequent in females than in males. Within the AMLCG study, FLT3-LM was of intermediate prognostic significance. The complete remission rate of 70.3% in patients with FLT3-LM was similar to that (70.4%) in patients without FLT3-LM. Overall survival was not different between patients with or without FLT3-LM. In contrast, patients with FLT3-LM had a significantly shorter event-free survival (7.4 vs 12.6 months; P =.0072) because of a higher relapse rate. Besides the importance of FLT3-LM for biologic and clinical characterization of AML, we show its value as a marker for disease monitoring based on 120 follow-up samples of 34 patients.","['Schnittger, Susanne', 'Schoch, Claudia', 'Dugas, Martin', 'Kern, Wolfgang', 'Staib, Peter', 'Wuchter, Christian', 'Loffler, Helmut', 'Sauerland, Cristina Maria', 'Serve, Hubert', 'Buchner, Thomas', 'Haferlach, Torsten', 'Hiddemann, Wolfgang']","['Schnittger S', 'Schoch C', 'Dugas M', 'Kern W', 'Staib P', 'Wuchter C', 'Loffler H', 'Sauerland CM', 'Serve H', 'Buchner T', 'Haferlach T', 'Hiddemann W']","['Department of Internal Medicine III, University of Munich, Germany. susanne.schnittger@med3.med.uni-muenchen.de']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis/genetics', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Gene Frequency', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/classification/diagnosis/*genetics/mortality', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Neoplasm, Residual/diagnosis/genetics/mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*genetics', 'Survival Analysis', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3']",2002/06/19 10:00,2002/07/27 10:01,['2002/06/19 10:00'],"['2002/06/19 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/07/27 10:01 [medline]', '2002/06/19 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood.v100.1.59 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)59973-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2002 Jul 1;100(1):59-66. doi: 10.1182/blood.v100.1.59.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, identification of residual leukemic cells by their morphologic features is subjective and lacks sensitivity. To improve estimates of leukemia clearance, we applied flow cytometric techniques capable of detecting 1 leukemic cell in 10,000 or more normal cells and prospectively measured residual leukemia in bone marrow samples collected on day 19 of remission-induction chemotherapy from 248 children with newly diagnosed ALL. In 134 samples (54.0%), we identified at least 0.01% leukemic cells (0.01%-< 0.1% in 51 samples [20.6%], 0.1%-< 1% in 36 [14.5%], and > or = 1% in 47 [19.0%]). Among 110 children treated within a single chemotherapy program, the 5-year mean +/- SE cumulative incidence of relapse or failure to achieve remission was 32.2% +/- 6.5% for the 59 patients with 0.01% residual leukemic cells or greater on day 19 and 6.0% +/- 3.4% for the 51 patients with less than 0.01% leukemic cells (P <.001). The prognostic value of day-19 bone marrow status defined by flow cytometry was superior to that defined by morphologic studies and remained significant after adjustment for other clinical and biologic variables. Lack of detectable leukemic cells on day 19 was more closely associated with relapse-free survival than was lack of detectable residual disease at the end of remission induction (day 46). Thus, approximately half of the children with ALL achieve profound clearance of leukemic cells after 2 to 3 weeks of remission-induction chemotherapy, and these patients have an excellent treatment outcome.","['Coustan-Smith, Elaine', 'Sancho, Jose', 'Behm, Frederick G', 'Hancock, Michael L', 'Razzouk, Bassem I', 'Ribeiro, Raul C', 'Rivera, Gaston K', 'Rubnitz, Jeffrey E', 'Sandlund, John T', 'Pui, Ching-Hon', 'Campana, Dario']","['Coustan-Smith E', 'Sancho J', 'Behm FG', 'Hancock ML', 'Razzouk BI', 'Ribeiro RC', 'Rivera GK', 'Rubnitz JE', 'Sandlund JT', 'Pui CH', 'Campana D']","[""Department of Hematology-Oncology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital and the University of Tennessee, Memphis, TN 38105, USA.""]",['eng'],"['CA20160/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA60419/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Bone Marrow Cells/immunology/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Neoplasm, Residual/diagnosis/pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Time Factors']",2002/06/19 10:00,2002/07/27 10:01,['2002/06/19 10:00'],"['2002/06/19 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/07/27 10:01 [medline]', '2002/06/19 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-01-0006 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)59972-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2002 Jul 1;100(1):52-8. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-01-0006.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A worse prognosis was observed even for patients with a low percentage of lymphoblasts (ie, 1%-4%) at either day 15 (5-year EFS = 56% +/- 8%) or days 22 to 25 (5-year EFS = 0%) compared to those without morphologically identifiable persistent lymphoblasts at these times (P <.001 for both comparisons). The prognostic impact of persistent lymphoblasts on both dates remained significant after adjusting for other known risk factors, including treatment protocol, age, white blood cell count, DNA index, cell lineage, and central nervous system status, and National Cancer Institute/Rome criteria simultaneously. Hence, persistence of lymphoblasts (even 1%-4%) on day 15 of remission induction was associated with a poor prognosis and on days 22 to 25 signified a particularly dismal outcome; these very high-risk patients require novel or more intensive therapy to improve outcome.","['Sandlund, John T', 'Harrison, Patricia L', 'Rivera, Gaston', 'Behm, Frederick G', 'Head, David', 'Boyett, James', 'Rubnitz, Jeffrey E', 'Gajjar, Amar', 'Raimondi, Susana', 'Ribeiro, Raul', 'Hudson, Melissa', 'Relling, Mary', 'Evans, William', 'Pui, Ching-Hon']","['Sandlund JT', 'Harrison PL', 'Rivera G', 'Behm FG', 'Head D', 'Boyett J', 'Rubnitz JE', 'Gajjar A', 'Raimondi S', 'Ribeiro R', 'Hudson M', 'Relling M', 'Evans W', 'Pui CH']","[""Department of Hematology-Oncology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, and the University of Tennessee, College of Medicine, Memphis, TN 38105, USA. john.sandlund@stjude.org""]",['eng'],"['CA 20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Blast Crisis/*pathology', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Neoplasm, Residual/diagnosis/mortality/pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/mortality/*pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Time Factors']",2002/06/19 10:00,2002/07/27 10:01,['2002/06/19 10:00'],"['2002/06/19 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/07/27 10:01 [medline]', '2002/06/19 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood.v100.1.43 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)59970-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2002 Jul 1;100(1):43-7. doi: 10.1182/blood.v100.1.43.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Combined treatment of HeLa cells with gamma-irradiation (1, 3 and 5 Grays) and extra low frequency magnetic fields of ~50 Hz was carried out under rigorously controlled conditions. RESULTS: Synchronised cells progressing from S-phase arrived at mitosis on average marginally ahead of irradiation controls not exposed to ELF.

An implication is that the immune system can be manipulated to enhance anti-leukaemic effects by exogenous stimulation including the use of immunostimulatory cytokines. These could potentially be used in a controlled manner that avoids the clinical problems associated with graft-versus-host disease. The cytokine used most extensively to date is interleukin-2 (IL2), a molecule that induces T lymphocyte proliferation and the generation of MHC unrestricted cytotoxicity. Despite over 10 years of clinical experience, the data on efficacy in acute myeloid leukaemia remains unclear due to lack of adequate randomised trials. IL2 appears to be effective in patients with low level marrow infiltration by acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) blast cells. It is less effective when patients present or relapse with packed bone marrows. The logical assumption that IL2 treatment given during states of minimal residual disease will reduce the incidence or speed of disease recurrence remains to be adequately tested. IL2 administration is associated with characteristic clinical adverse effects and with specific immuno-haematological changes. The use of other cytokines for immune manipulation in patients with AML is so far essentially limited to the research laboratory. Potential uses include cytokine induced blast differentiation to dendritic cells and the use of irradiated cytokine gene transduced leukaemic cells as vaccines.","['Gottlieb, David']",['Gottlieb D'],"['Department of Medicine, Westmead Institute for Cancer Research, Sydney University at Westmead Hospital, NSW, Australia. davidg@westgate.wh.usyd.edu.au']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United Arab Emirates,Curr Pharm Des,Current pharmaceutical design,9602487,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens)', '0 (Interleukin-2)']",IM,"['Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Cytokines/*immunology', 'Dendritic Cells/immunology', 'Histocompatibility Antigens/immunology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/immunology/physiology/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*immunology/*therapy', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology']",2002/06/19 10:00,2004/06/23 05:00,['2002/06/19 10:00'],"['2002/06/19 10:00 [pubmed]', '2004/06/23 05:00 [medline]', '2002/06/19 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.2174/1381612023396087 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Pharm Des. 2002;8(5):419-31. doi: 10.2174/1381612023396087.,,,,,,,188,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The need for such transfusion is related to the depth and duration of ""critical"" thrombocytopenia, a level that until recently was hotly debated. However a number of clinical trials have established that transfusion at a platelet count greater than 10 x 10(9)/L was safe in the absence of factors associated with increased tendency to bleed. Trying to predict which patients are at risk of bleeding due to thrombocytopenia has proven difficult outside of those scenarios that inevitably cause severe thrombocytopenia, such as treatment of leukemia and myeloablative chemotherapy with stem cell support. Models have been proposed but have yet to be validated. Of greater importance is the need for proof that intensive treatment of solid tumours with growth tactor support leads to improved outcomes. The discovery of platelet growth factors raised expectations that an effective method for abrogating thrombocytopenia would be soon available in the clinic. The cytokines initially described were pleiotropic in nature, and stimulation of platelet production was generally modest. However, one of these agents, interleukin-11, was successfully shown to reduce the incidence of severe thrombocytopenia in patients receiving dose-intensive chemotherapy, and has now received approval from the FDA for this purpose. Initial clinical trials of thrombopoietin (TPO), the central regulator of megakaryocytopoiesis and thrombopoiesis, and its analogues showed these agents to be the most potent stimulators of thrombopoiesis and to be associated with few adverse effects. They have also been shown to enhance platelet recovery after chemotherapy, but early results from trials investigating their ability to prevent severe thrombocytopenia associated with the treatment of leukemia and bone marrow transplantation have been disappointing. In addition, subcutaneous administration of one of these agents, megakaryocyte growth and development factor, has been shown to induce the formation of antibodies that neutralize native TPO and cause thrombocytopenia. TPO remains a promising therapeutic agent, however its potential application is more limited than initially anticipated, and there are a number of obstacles to overcome before it finds an importance use in the clinic.","['Basser, Russell']",['Basser R'],"['Department of Clinical Haematology, Royal Melbourne Hospital, Victoria, Australia. russell_basser@csl.com.au']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United Arab Emirates,Curr Pharm Des,Current pharmaceutical design,9602487,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-11)', '9014-42-0 (Thrombopoietin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Cytokines/*therapeutic use', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-11/therapeutic use', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/therapy', 'Platelet Transfusion', 'Thrombocytopenia/chemically induced/drug therapy', 'Thrombopoiesis/drug effects', 'Thrombopoietin/*pharmacology/therapeutic use']",2002/06/19 10:00,2004/06/23 05:00,['2002/06/19 10:00'],"['2002/06/19 10:00 [pubmed]', '2004/06/23 05:00 [medline]', '2002/06/19 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.2174/1381612023395989 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Pharm Des. 2002;8(5):369-77. doi: 10.2174/1381612023395989.,,,,,,,83,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The transformation of cells is primarily due to molecular aberrations leading to excessive cellular signalling and proliferation. In addition cytokines and their receptors may play a role in leukaemogenesis by increasing the proliferative capacity of leukaemic cells and extending their life span. Chemotherapeutic agents are regularly used to treat patients with leukaemia but they are non-discriminatory treatments that kill both healthy and cancer cells. Consequently patients receiving chemotherapy suffer unwanted toxicities in both the haematological and other systems. Therapies that specifically target malignant cells sparing normal cells are being investigated in a number of contexts.

Cytokines influence stem survival, proliferation, and differentiation commitment, as well as controlling the orderly maturation of progenitor cells into functional leucocytes, erythrocytes, and platelets. Acute leukemias result from malignant transformation of bone marrow stem cells. Although cytokines do not appear to be centrally involved in the pathogenesis of acute leukemias, leukemic cells express receptors for many of the cytokines regulating normal hematopoiesis, particularly G-CSF, GM-CSF, IL-3, and stem cell factor. These molecules have demonstrable effects on acute leukemia cells in vitro, inducing proliferation and enhancing survival, but their biological activity when administered as recombinant proteins in pharmaceutical doses to patients with active leukemia are less well understood. Because of the stimulatory effects of cytokines such as G-CSF and GM-CSF on normal hematopoiesis in vitro and in normal individuals, these two molecules have been extensively studied in randomised clinical trials of chemotherapy for cancer, including acute leukemia. Concerns about the potential for G-CSF and GM-CSF to accelerate the growth of acute myeloid leukemia, which expresses receptors for both molecules, have not been realised. Conversely, the concept of using either of these two cytokines to induce acute myeloid leukemia cells into active DNA synthesis, thus potentially sensitising them to the effects of S-phase-specific drugs, has not been shown to be clinically beneficial. Both G-CSF and GM-CSF have been demonstrated to accelerate the recovery of normal granulopoiesis after intensive initial cytotoxic chemotherapy for acute leukemia, significantly shortening the duration of severe treatment-induced neutropenia, and resulting in a number of tangible benefits including reduction in infection, use of intravenous antibiotics, and duration of hospital stay. However, the final role for these agents in the treatment of acute leukemia remains controversial and still to be fully defined.","['Bradstock, Kenneth F']",['Bradstock KF'],"['Department of Haematology, Westmead Hospital, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. bradstok@icpmr.wsahs.nsw.gov.au']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United Arab Emirates,Curr Pharm Des,Current pharmaceutical design,9602487,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Cytokines/physiology/therapeutic use', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/therapeutic use', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/therapeutic use', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*therapy', 'Stem Cell Factor/therapeutic use']",2002/06/19 10:00,2004/06/23 05:00,['2002/06/19 10:00'],"['2002/06/19 10:00 [pubmed]', '2004/06/23 05:00 [medline]', '2002/06/19 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.2174/1381612023396041 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Pharm Des. 2002;8(5):343-55. doi: 10.2174/1381612023396041.,,,,,,,133,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present study, based on a long-term follow-up of 68 MDS patients (26RA, 16 RAS, 26 RAEB) treated with EPO alone, pinpoints pre-treatment variables associated with response induction, response duration and overall survival. Response, defined as an increase in haemoglobin >15gL1 or eliminated erythrocyte transfusion requirements, was observed in 22 of 66 (33%) evaluable patients. The median response duration was 15 (range 3-64+) months. Using univariate logistic regression models, responders displayed significantly lower baseline serum EPO levels (S-EPO), more often normal bone marrow blast cell content (RA/RAS vs. RAEB), normal cytogenetics and no need for erythrocyte transfusion. In a multiple logistic regression model, S-EPO (P=0.009), marrow blast content (P=0.031) and erythrocyte transfusion need (P=0.024) remained associated with response induction. The probability of response for a patient with S-EPO >50UL1, RA/RAS and no transfusion need was 0.79 (0.53-0.93, 95% CI). The median overall survival time from start of EPO treatment was 26 months, significantly longer for responders than for non-responders (49 vs. 18 months, P=0.018). Survival was also predicted by baseline S-EPO; patients with S-EPO >50UL1 (n=50) had a median survival of 17 months, as compared to 65 months for those with S-EPO >50UL1 (n=14, P=0.024). The international prognostic scoring system (IPSS) for MDS predicted survival (P=0.003) and progression to acute leukemia (P<0.001) but not response to EPO treatment. Furthermore, in a logistic regression model with S-EPO and IPSS, S-EPO (but not IPSS) was again a significant predictor for response (P=0.007). Our data facilitate the optimal selection of MDS patients suitable for EPO treatment and pinpoint S-EPO as a powerful predictor of response and overall survival in MDS.","['Wallvik, Jonas', 'Stenke, Leif', 'Bernell, Per', 'Nordahl, Gunnar', 'Hippe, Erik', 'Hast, Robert']","['Wallvik J', 'Stenke L', 'Bernell P', 'Nordahl G', 'Hippe E', 'Hast R']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Sundsvall Hospital, Sweden. jonas.wallvik@lvn.se']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Hemoglobins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Anemia, Refractory/blood/drug therapy', 'Anemia, Refractory, with Excess of Blasts/blood/drug therapy', 'Bone Marrow Cells/pathology', 'Erythrocyte Transfusion', 'Erythropoietin/*blood/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Hemoglobins/analysis', 'Humans', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*blood/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Survival Rate']",2002/06/19 10:00,2002/06/28 10:01,['2002/06/19 10:00'],"['2002/06/19 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/06/28 10:01 [medline]', '2002/06/19 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1034/j.1600-0609.2002.01530.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2002 Mar;68(3):180-5. doi: 10.1034/j.1600-0609.2002.01530.x.,,,,['Acta Haematol. 2016;136(1):23-42.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Between 1981 and 1995, patients with follicular lymphoma were treated with combined chemotherapy, mostly anthracycline-based regimens; patients who achieved complete response were randomly assigned either to receive adjuvant radiotherapy to sites or to nodal bulky disease or not (control group). RESULTS: Four hundred and sixty-nine patients were randomized; in an intent-to-treat analysis all were evaluable for efficacy and toxicity. Actuarial curves at 20yr showed that event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) in the control group were 41% [95% confidence interval (CI) 36-56%) and 71% (95% CI 65-78%), respectively; these were statistically different from results for the patients who received adjuvant radiotherapy: 68% (95% CI 62-72%) and 89% (95% CI 79-96%), respectively (P<0.01). Acute and late toxicity were minimal; only four patients (<1%) developed myelodysplastic syndrome/acute leukemia. Cardiac toxicity was 2%, but one case was lethal. Thirty-six patients (8%) died secondary to unrelated causes, in complete remission. CONCLUSIONS: The use of adjuvant radiotherapy in patients with poor-prognosis follicular lymphoma increases EFS and OS with minimal toxicity. We feel that follicular lymphoma should be treated curatively because <80% of patients will be in first complete response at <20yr. The use of adjuvant radiotherapy will be considered in the first line of treatment in this set of patients.","['Aviles, Agustin', 'Delgado, Serafin', 'Fernandez, Raul', 'Talavera, Alejandra', 'Neri, Natividad', 'Huerta-Guzman, Judith']","['Aviles A', 'Delgado S', 'Fernandez R', 'Talavera A', 'Neri N', 'Huerta-Guzman J']","['Research Unit in Oncological Diseases, Oncology Hospital, National Medical Center, IMSS, Mexico D.F., Mexico. agaviles@avatel.net']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Cause of Death', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Heart Diseases/chemically induced', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/*drug therapy/mortality/*radiotherapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myocardial Infarction/chemically induced', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Rate']",2002/06/19 10:00,2002/06/28 10:01,['2002/06/19 10:00'],"['2002/06/19 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/06/28 10:01 [medline]', '2002/06/19 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1034/j.1600-0609.2002.01542.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2002 Mar;68(3):144-9. doi: 10.1034/j.1600-0609.2002.01542.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PURPOSE-METHODS: To study the clinical significance of functional markers linked to proliferation (CD25), adhesion (CD54), and apoptosis (CD95) on B- and T-cells in 68 patients with CLL using dual colour flow cytometry (FCM). RESULTS: The mean proportion of CD19+ B-cells expressing CD25 was significantly higher in CLL patients compared to controls (P=0.02), while CD54+ and CD95+ B-cells did not differ significantly. In CLL with atypical morphology and in patients with trisomy 12, the mean percentage of CD25+ B-cells was lower than in typical CLL (P<0.02) and in patients with disomic tumor cells (P<0.03). Patients with 30% of CD25+ B-cells had a shorter median time to treatment than CD25-negative cases (P=0.01). A low CD54 expression was associated with a prolonged median time to treatment (P=0.004), low WBC counts (P<0.05), and low S-LDH (P=0.03). A high CD95 expression was correlated with elevated S-LDH (P=0.02) and a finding of lymphadenopathy (P=0.02).

CONCLUSIONS: CD25 and CD54 expression on CD19+ cells seems to give prognostic information.

The physical examination and particularly the cavernosal blood gas study, indicated low flow priapism. Punction-lavage of the corpora cavernosa was performed. Because complete response was not achieved with this procedure, adjuvant intracavernous methoxamine was administered. RESULTS: Complete detumescence was achieved after the third dose of methoxamine. There was no recurrence and erectile function was preserved.

Etiologies of this condition are numerous. Recent advances in the understanding of erectile physiology have improved the prompt diagnosis and treatment of priapism. Treatment of priapism varies from a conservative medical to a drastic surgical approach. Normally, priapism is effectively treated with intracavernous vasoconstrictive agents or surgical shunting. Recent findings indicate methylene blue (MB), a guanylate cyclase inhibitor, to be a potential inhibitor of endothelial-mediated cavernous relaxation. This prompted us to assess the feasibility, the use and the effectiveness of MB in the treatment of priapism. METHODS: 25 patients were treated for priapism. Etiologies were: 22 drug-mediated (PGE1 or papaverine/phentolamine mixture) after corpus cavernosum injection therapy (CCIT), 1 leukemia-induced and 2 idiopathic high-flow priapism. Patient ages ranged from 13 to 72 years. The average duration of priapism was 5 hours and 22 minutes after CCIT. MB was administered after blood aspiration of the corpora cavernosa. 5 ml of MB was injected intracavernously (i.c.) and left for 5 min. MB was then aspirated and the penis compressed for an additional 5 min. RESULTS: All patients with CCIT-induced priapism were cured with MB alone. The 3 patients who did not respond to MB underwent i.c. phenylephrine administration and finally, if necessary, embolization of the pudendal artery. Etiology and duration of priapism were the strongest predictors for success with intracavernously administered MB. The primary side effects were a transient burning sensation and blue discoloration of the penis on injection of MB. The initial baseline erectile status was restored in all patients cured by MB. CONCLUSIONS: These results confirm that MB is a safe and highly effective treatment agent for short-term pharmacologically-induced priapism. Furthermore, MB demonstrates distinct advantages over a-adrenergic agents for intracavernous use, such as lower costs, absence of systemic or local toxic side effects and shorter treatment time leading to faster detumescence. For this reason, MB is a suitable and safe substance for alternative routine intracavernous therapy in males with pharmacologically-induced priapism.","['Martinez Portillo, Francisco Jose', 'Fernandez Arancibia, Mario Ignacio', 'Bach, Sebastian', 'Alken, Peter', 'Junemann, Klaus-Peter']","['Martinez Portillo FJ', 'Fernandez Arancibia MI', 'Bach S', 'Alken P', 'Junemann KP']","['Departamento de Urologia, Clinica Universitaria de Kiel, Universidad de Kiel, Alemania. fmartinez@urology.uni-kiel.de']",['spa'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Spain,Arch Esp Urol,Archivos espanoles de urologia,0064757,"['0 (Vasodilator Agents)', 'T42P99266K (Methylene Blue)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Humans', 'Injections', 'Male', 'Methylene Blue/*therapeutic use', 'Middle Aged', 'Penis', 'Priapism/*chemically induced/*drug therapy', 'Vasodilator Agents/*adverse effects']",2002/06/19 10:00,2002/12/18 04:00,['2002/06/19 10:00'],"['2002/06/19 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/18 04:00 [medline]', '2002/06/19 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Arch Esp Urol. 2002 Apr;55(3):303-8.,,,,,Azul de metileno: una efectiva alternativa terapeutica para el priapismo inducido por inyeccion intracavernosa de sustancias vasoactivas.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Strategies to prolong remission and improve survival include high-dose chemotherapy, autologous or allogeneic stem cell transplantation, and other immunotherapeutic approaches. The focus on interleukin-2 (IL-2) has arisen from in vitro demonstration of enhancement of tumor-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte and natural killer-cell activity after cytokine activation. The local secretion of inhibitory substances and oxidative stress by monocyte/macrophage populations may inhibit the cytotoxic capacity of these effector cells. Recently, agents capable of modulating cytotoxic effector function have been identified, including histamine dihydrochloride, which has been shown to act as an inhibitor of cellular-mediated free-radical production. In the presence of histamine, cytotoxic effector function may be restored. The addition of histamine to IL-2-based cytokine therapies has resulted in enhanced in vitro cytotoxic T-cell and natural killer-cell function and has allowed for the development of lower, and thus, less toxic, IL-2 regimens. Preliminary studies of this combination in patients with acute myeloid leukemia in remission suggest improved survival with tolerable toxicity.

However, the outcome with these agents has been less than optimal. While experiments in vitro would lead one to believe that these agents would be useful therapeutic alternatives, the situation in vivo is confounded by the fact that the microenvironments of the tumor and surrounding tissue are infiltrated with monocytes and macrophages, which suppress the cytotoxic activity of T cells and natural killer cells. The mechanism by which this occurs is through the generation of reactive oxygen species that are responsible for apoptosis by both T cells and natural killer cells. Histamine abrogates this suppression, thus restoring the cytotoxicity of these cells. Therefore, the addition of histamine to regimens containing cytokines is expected to optimize cytokine therapy. Clinical trials with these regimens are under way in the treatment of metastatic malignant melanoma, acute myelogenous leukemia, and renal cell carcinoma.

Approval by the US Food and Drug Administration was granted early for the treatment of patients with hairy cell leukemia, acquired immune deficiency syndrome-related Kaposi's sarcoma, and condylomata acuminata. Although IFNs are effective as single agents in certain clinical pathologic entities, increasing experience with these cytokines suggests that their greatest therapeutic potential may be realized in combination with other biological response modifiers, cytotoxics, or antiviral agents. For example, trials combining IFN-alpha with 5-fluorouracil to treat colorectal carcinoma or IFN-alpha with zidovudine to treat acquired immune deficiency disorder showed increased efficacy over IFN-alpha alone. While IFN-alpha appears to be moderately effective in certain diseases, the flu-like syndrome associated with its use is a major limiting factor for its clinical application. Further studies are needed to determine the underlying mechanism of action for IFNs and the most effective combinations and appropriate preclinical models, or intermediate endpoints that will then facilitate the rational use of this agent in combinations based on the mechanisms of action of IFN-alpha.","['Kirkwood, John']",['Kirkwood J'],"['University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, Pittsburgh, PA 15213-2582, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Semin Oncol,Seminars in oncology,0420432,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Immunologic Factors)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Antiviral Agents/therapeutic use', 'Carcinoma, Renal Cell/drug therapy', 'Hepatitis C, Chronic/drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Factors/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', '*Immunotherapy, Active', 'Interferon-alpha/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Kidney Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy', 'Melanoma/drug therapy', 'Multiple Myeloma/drug therapy', 'Polycythemia Vera/drug therapy', 'Sarcoma, Kaposi/drug therapy', 'Thrombocytosis/drug therapy']",2002/06/18 10:00,2002/06/28 10:01,['2002/06/18 10:00'],"['2002/06/18 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/06/28 10:01 [medline]', '2002/06/18 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0093-7754(02)50195-0 [pii]', '10.1053/sonc.2002.33078 [doi]']",ppublish,Semin Oncol. 2002 Jun;29(3 Suppl 7):18-26. doi: 10.1053/sonc.2002.33078.,,,,,,,74,,"['Copyright 2002, Elsevier Science (USA).

Serum levels of EPO, soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) in anemic cancer children were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and then the correlation coefficients between those parameters and hemoglobin (Hb) were determined. Both in leukemia and in solid tumor patients, there were significant inverse correlations between Hb and EPO (leukemia: tau=-0.547, p<0.0001; solid tumor: tau=-0.591, p<0.0001), and between sTfR and EPO (leukemia: tau=-0.223, p<0.05; solid tumor: tau=-0.401, p<0.05).

We investigated the mechanism of TAS-103-induced apoptosis in human cell lines. Pulsed field gel electrophoresis revealed that in the leukemia cell line HL-60 and the H(2)O(2)-resistant subclone, HP100, TAS-103 induced DNA cleavage to form 1-2-Mb fragments at 1 h to a similar extent, indicating that the DNA cleavage was induced independently of H(2)O(2). TAS-103-induced DNA ladder formation in HP100 cells was delayed compared with that seen at 4 h in HL-60 cells, suggesting the involvement of H(2)O(2)-mediated pathways in apoptosis. Flow cytometry revealed that H(2)O(2) formation preceded increases in mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsim) and caspase-3 activation. Inhibitors of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) prevented both TAS-103-induced H(2)O(2) generation and DNA ladder formation. The levels of NAD(+), a PARP substrate, were significantly decreased in HL-60 cells after a 3-h incubation with TAS-103. The decreases in NAD(+) levels preceded both increases in DeltaPsim and DNA ladder formation. Inhibitors of NAD(P)H oxidase prevented TAS-103-induced apoptosis, suggesting that NAD(P)H oxidase is the primary enzyme mediating H(2)O(2) formation. Expression of the antiapoptotic protein, Bcl-2, in BJAB cells drastically inhibited TAS-103-induced apoptosis, confirming that H(2)O(2) generation occurs upstream of mitochondrial permeability transition. Therefore, these findings indicate that DNA cleavage by TAS-103 induces PARP hyperactivation and subsequent NAD(+) depletion, followed by the activation of NAD(P)H oxidase. This enzyme mediates O(2)(-)-derived H(2)O(2) generation, followed by the increase in DeltaPsim and subsequent caspase-3 activation, leading to apoptosis.","['Mizutani, Hideki', 'Tada-Oikawa, Saeko', 'Hiraku, Yusuke', 'Oikawa, Shinji', 'Kojima, Michio', 'Kawanishi, Shosuke']","['Mizutani H', 'Tada-Oikawa S', 'Hiraku Y', 'Oikawa S', 'Kojima M', 'Kawanishi S']","['Department of Environmental and Molecular Medicine, Mie University School of Medicine, Edobashi, Tsu, Mie 514-8507, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Aminoquinolines)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Indenes)', '0 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Topoisomerase I Inhibitors)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (NADPH Oxidases)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'YVC96489QV', '(6-((2-(dimethylamino)ethyl)amino)-3-hydroxy-7H-indeno(2,1-c)quinolin-7-one)']",IM,"['Aminoquinolines/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'DNA Damage', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/*metabolism', 'Indenes/*pharmacology', 'NADPH Oxidases/antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase Inhibitors', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/physiology', '*Topoisomerase I Inhibitors']",2002/06/18 10:00,2002/09/24 06:00,['2002/06/18 10:00'],"['2002/06/18 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/24 06:00 [medline]', '2002/06/18 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M204353200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(20)70146-8 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2002 Aug 23;277(34):30684-9. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M204353200.

Classification of these genes into functional groups including cellular receptors, kinases, phosphatases, cytokines, signal proteins, and transcription factors provides insight into genes and pathways that are differentially regulated during HTLV-I transformation.","['Pise-Masison, Cynthia A', 'Radonovich, Michael', 'Mahieux, Renaud', 'Chatterjee, Pramita', 'Whiteford, Craig', 'Duvall, Janet', 'Guillerm, Claire', 'Gessain, Antoine', 'Brady, John N']","['Pise-Masison CA', 'Radonovich M', 'Mahieux R', 'Chatterjee P', 'Whiteford C', 'Duvall J', 'Guillerm C', 'Gessain A', 'Brady JN']","['Basic Research Laboratory, Virus Tumor Biology Section, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (IL2RA protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/genetics', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Cell Transformation, Viral/genetics/immunology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytokines/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit', 'Jurkat Cells/metabolism/physiology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Receptors, Interleukin/biosynthesis/genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/metabolism/*physiology/*virology', 'Transcription Factors/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection']",2002/06/18 10:00,2002/07/20 10:01,['2002/06/18 10:00'],"['2002/06/18 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/07/20 10:01 [medline]', '2002/06/18 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 2002 Jun 15;62(12):3562-71.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although vast areas of Europe were affected by Chernobyl-related ionising radiation, the accident had the greatest impact in Belarus, Ukraine, and the Russian Federation. Epidemiological studies that have investigated the link between the Chernobyl accident and cancer have largely focused on malignant diseases in children, specifically thyroid cancer and leukaemia. There is good evidence to suggest that rates of thyroid cancer in children from the countries that were formally part of the Soviet Union have risen as a consequence of the Chernobyl accident. The findings for childhood leukaemia are less conclusive. Overall rates for this disease do not seem to have been affected by the Chernobyl-related ionising radiation, but there may be a larger risk of infant leukaemia in contaminated areas of Europe. Among adult populations, there is no strong evidence to suggest that risk of thyroid cancer, leukaemia, or other malignant disease has increased as a result of the Chernobyl accident.","['Moysich, Kirsten B', 'Menezes, Ravi J', 'Michalek, Arthur M']","['Moysich KB', 'Menezes RJ', 'Michalek AM']","['Department of Cancer Prevention, Epidemiology, and Biostatistics, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, NY 14226, USA. kirsten.moyisch@roswellpark.org']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", 'Review']",England,Lancet Oncol,The Lancet.

In cancer, epidemiologists have traditionally sought to incriminate exposures; geneticists uncover inherited susceptibility; and molecular biologists deconstruct the proximal mechanisms of cell transformation. Molecular epidemiology promises to deliver new insights in terms of gene-environment interactions. Each of these endeavours has undeniably provided rich dividends and insights into cancer causation, but are these likely to be sufficient as a coherent explanation of our vulnerability to cancer? I suggest that the biological plausibility of causal mechanisms would benefit from a historical, evolutionary perspective. The essential argument is that genes or gene variants and phenotypic traits that were adaptively selected in the past as advantageous now contribute crucially to cancer because of their mismatch with current environmental and social circumstances. The risk attributes of skin pigmentation and some dietary factors in cancer can be plausibly interpreted within this context. A case is made here for a Darwinian perspective on breast and prostate cancers, for which current understanding of causation is limited and contentious.","['Greaves, Mel']",['Greaves M'],"['Cell Biology and the Leukaemia Research Fund Centre for Cell and Molecular Biology, Institute of Cancer Research, London, UK. m.greaves@icr.ac.uk']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Lancet Oncol,The Lancet.

First, we used flow cytometry to quantitate AAV-GFP or ADV-GFP transduction in 13 cell lines derived from malignant tissue (6 gliomas, 6 mammary cancers, and 1 leukemia). These experiments showed variable transduction efficiency (0%-81%) between the cell lines, with ADV being more effective compared to AAV in 9 of 13 cell lines. Second, spheroids prepared from human glioblastomas were infected with ADV or AAV expressing GFP or lacZ cassettes, and after 2 weeks, uniform reporter gene expression was observed on the spheroid. Whereas AAV produced consistent transduction throughout the spheroids, ADV infection was mainly limited to the outer cell layers of the spheroids, suggesting that AAV were more efficient at penetrating solid tumor tissue. Third, human biopsies from glioblastoma multiforme patients were xenografted into nude rats and grown for 4 weeks followed by viral vector injection. Combined use of high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and histologic analysis allowed the identification of transduced cells and their spatial distribution within the tumors. AAV-mediated transgene expression was observed in cell clusters through the entire tumor, while ADV-mediated transduction was restricted to cells at the tumor periphery. Thus, while AAV and ADV vectors may infect tumor-derived cell lines to a similar degree, AAV penetrated glioblastoma spheroids and xenografts more efficiently compared to ADV vectors. These results suggest that AAV may be suitable for therapeutic gene delivery to malignant tumors.","['Enger, Per Oyvind', 'Thorsen, Frits', 'Lonning, Per Eystein', 'Bjerkvig, Rolf', 'Hoover, Frank']","['Enger PO', 'Thorsen F', 'Lonning PE', 'Bjerkvig R', 'Hoover F']","['Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Hum Gene Ther,Human gene therapy,9008950,,IM,"['Adenoviridae/*genetics/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Dependovirus/*genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genetic Vectors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Glioblastoma/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Rats', 'Rats, Nude', 'Spheroids, Cellular/metabolism', '*Transduction, Genetic', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/06/18 10:00,2002/09/28 04:00,['2002/06/18 10:00'],"['2002/06/18 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/28 04:00 [medline]', '2002/06/18 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/104303402753812511 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Gene Ther. 2002 Jun 10;13(9):1115-25. doi: 10.1089/104303402753812511.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These vectors target HIV-1 RNAs containing sequences of the envelope gene by expressing a 1-kb fragment of the HIV-1 Tat/Rev intron in the antisense orientation. Expression of the envelope antisense gene (envAS) was evaluated under the control of different internal promoters such as the human phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) promoter, the human EF1-alpha promoter, and the U3 region of the SL3 murine leukemia virus. The U3-SL3 promoter transactivates transcription from the vector HIV-1 LTR and drives higher expression levels of envAS-containing RNAs than other promoters in T-cell lines. The effect of other vector structural features was also evaluated. We found that the central polypurine tract and central termination sequence (cPPT) produce a small increase in vector infectivity of 2-fold to 3-fold and results in a 10-fold higher inhibition of wild-type viral replication in challenge experiments. The woodchuck hepatitis posttranscriptional regulatory element (WPRE) does not increase the cytoplasmic levels of envAS mRNA in T-cell lines. We observed that SupT1 and primary CD4(+) T cells transduced with these vectors showed high inhibition of HIV-1 replication, suppression of syncitium formation, and increased cell viability when infected with several HIV-1 laboratory strains.

In 7% of patients with p210 expression there are both isoforms (b3a2/b2a2), presumably the result of alternative splicing. The rate of coexpression of the p190/p210 transcripts was 5%, which is much lower than in other reports. This may be due to the technical factors. These patients had high platelet counts, marked splenomegaly and chromosomal abnormalities in addition to Ph'. Other types of coexpression seen were p210/p230 and p190/p210/p230, in patients with high-risk clinical factors. Our study confirms the occurrence of coexpression of different BCR/ABL transcripts, although the rate (9.6%) was much lower than has been reported in other populations. This may reflect either the sensitivity of the detection techniques used or the possibility of genetic differences between the populations studied. Coexpression may be due to alternative splicing or to phenotypic variation, with clinical courses different from classical CML.","['Arana-Trejo, R M', 'Ruiz Sanchez, E', 'Ignacio-Ibarra, G', 'Baez de la Fuente, E', 'Garces, O', 'Gomez Morales, E', 'Castro Granados, M', 'Ovilla Martinez, R', 'Rubio-Borja, M E', 'Solis Anaya, L', 'Herrera, P', 'Delgado Llamas, J', 'Kofman, S']","['Arana-Trejo RM', 'Ruiz Sanchez E', 'Ignacio-Ibarra G', 'Baez de la Fuente E', 'Garces O', 'Gomez Morales E', 'Castro Granados M', 'Ovilla Martinez R', 'Rubio-Borja ME', 'Solis Anaya L', 'Herrera P', 'Delgado Llamas J', 'Kofman S']","['Genetica, Hospital General de Mexico, O.D.

Since phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase) is a critical player in cell proliferation, survival, and differentiation, we studied the role of PI3-kinase during induction of the differentiated monocytic phenotype and superoxide production. In treatment of HL-60 cells with PMA, the PI3-kinase inhibitors LY294002 and wortmannin inhibited cell adhesion and spreading and phagocytic activity. LY294002 and wortmannin also inhibited the proliferation of HL-60 cells. During PMA-induced monocytic differentiation, LY294002 induced apoptosis in a dose dependent manner. The phosphorylation of p85alpha derived from PMA-stimulated HL-60 cells was shown in the time dependent manner. However, p70 S6 kinase inhibitor, rapamycin, did not inhibit PMA-induced monocytic differentiation. During PMA-induced monocytic differentiation, LY294002 inhibited c-jun protein expression and decrease of c-myc protein level. In contrast, LY294002 induced production of superoxide in the HL-60 cells stimulated with forskolin. Moreover, staurosporine and H7, PKC inhibitors, enhanced superoxide production in dibutyryl cAMP-induced HL-60 cells. These results suggest that PI3-kinase may regulate PMA-induced differentiation signal and provide a crucial link between PKC and cAMP in HL-60 cells.","['Park, Sung-Joo', 'Kang, Sin-Yol', 'Kim, Nam-Song', 'Kim, Hyung-Min']","['Park SJ', 'Kang SY', 'Kim NS', 'Kim HM']","['Department of Oriental Pharmacy, College of Pharmacy, Center of Oriental Medicinal Science, Iksan, Chonbuk, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Immunopharmacol Immunotoxicol,Immunopharmacology and immunotoxicology,8800150,"['0 (Androstadienes)', '0 (Chromones)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Morpholines)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '11062-77-4 (Superoxides)', '1F7A44V6OU (Colforsin)', '31M2U1DVID (2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)', '63X7MBT2LQ (Bucladesine)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinases, 70-kDa)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (ribosomal protein S6 kinase, 70kD, polypeptide 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'XVA4O219QW (Wortmannin)']",IM,"['Androstadienes/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Bucladesine/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Chromones/pharmacology', 'Colforsin/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Monocytes/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Morpholines/pharmacology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*metabolism', 'Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Kinase C/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/metabolism', 'Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinases, 70-kDa/metabolism', 'Superoxides/*metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Wortmannin']",2002/06/18 10:00,2003/01/08 04:00,['2002/06/18 10:00'],"['2002/06/18 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/08 04:00 [medline]', '2002/06/18 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1081/iph-120003751 [doi]'],ppublish,Immunopharmacol Immunotoxicol. 2002 May;24(2):211-26. doi: 10.1081/iph-120003751.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Murine cells are semi-permissive to adenovirus replication, and persistent or abortive infections have been associated with tumorigenic potential. Given that only human lymphoid cells are semi-permissive and abortive infections have been described, we hypothesized that adenovirus could be related to the transformation of human haematopoietic cells. We studied 30 lymphomas, 46 leukemias, 10 reactive lymphadenopathies and 40 normal human spleens. The presence of adenovirus sequences and proteins were studied using PCR, southern-blot, slot-blot, in situ hybridization, immunohistochemistry, and western-blot techniques. By using nested PCR, adenovirus sequences were detectable in about 30% of lymphomas, but in less than 10% of leukemias, reactive lymphadenopathies and normal spleens. In no case were we able to demonstrate adenovirus products by in situ hybridization, immunohistochemistry or western-blot. These results indicate that adenovirus sequences are present in a significant number of human lymphomas, but that the number of positive cells is extremely low and no protein expression could be detected. Therefore, we are unable to conclude that persistent infections of human lymphoid cells by adenovirus is related to a higher risk of developing malignant lymphomas or leukemias.","['Fernandez-Soria, Victor', 'Bornstein, Rafael', 'Forteza, Jeronimo', 'Parada, Carlos', 'Sanchez-Prieto, Ricado', 'Ramon y Cajal, Santiago']","['Fernandez-Soria V', 'Bornstein R', 'Forteza J', 'Parada C', 'Sanchez-Prieto R', 'Ramon y Cajal S']","['Department of Pathology, Clinica Puerta de Hierro de Madrid, Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Oncol Rep,Oncology reports,9422756,"['0 (Adenovirus E1A Proteins)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (RNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Adenovirus E1A Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Adenovirus Infections, Human/pathology/*virology', 'Adenoviruses, Human/*genetics', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Case-Control Studies', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA, Viral/*analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/pathology/*virology', 'Lymphoma/pathology/*virology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Viral/analysis', 'Spleen/virology']",2002/06/18 10:00,2003/01/09 04:00,['2002/06/18 10:00'],"['2002/06/18 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/09 04:00 [medline]', '2002/06/18 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncol Rep. 2002 Jul-Aug;9(4):897-902.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: In the present study, serum tryptase levels were measured in patients with mastocytosis by fluoroenzyme immunoassay and compared with the extent of infiltration of the bone marrow (BM) by neoplastic MC, determined by tryptase immunohistochemistry. Sixteen patients with cutaneous mastocytosis (CM) and 43 patients with systemic mastocytosis (SM) were examined. RESULTS: In most patients with CM (defined by the absence of dense compact MC infiltrates in tryptase-stained BM sections), normal or near-normal serum tryptase levels (median 10 ng/ml, range 2-23 ng/ml) were measured. By contrast, in the vast majority of patients with SM, elevated serum tryptase levels (median 67 ng/ml) were found. In addition, there was a significant correlation between the grade of infiltration of the BM by neoplastic MC and tryptase levels in patients with SM (r = 0.8). Moreover, enzyme levels differed significantly among the groups of patients with different types of SM. The highest levels (>900 ng/ml) were detected in the patient with MC leukemia, 2 patients with slowly progressing SM and high MC burden (smoldering SM) and 1 patient with indolent SM. In contrast, in all 3 patients with isolated BM mastocytosis (no skin lesions and no signs of multiorgan involvement), serum tryptase levels were <20 ng/ml. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, our data suggest that the measurement of serum tryptase is a reliable noninvasive diagnostic approach to estimate the burden of MC in patients with mastocytosis and to distinguish between categories of disease.","['Sperr, Wolfgang R', 'Jordan, John-Hendrik', 'Fiegl, Michael', 'Escribano, Luis', 'Bellas, Carmen', 'Dirnhofer, Stephan', 'Semper, Hans', 'Simonitsch-Klupp, Ingrid', 'Horny, Hans-Peter', 'Valent, Peter']","['Sperr WR', 'Jordan JH', 'Fiegl M', 'Escribano L', 'Bellas C', 'Dirnhofer S', 'Semper H', 'Simonitsch-Klupp I', 'Horny HP', 'Valent P']","['Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, University of Vienna, Austria. wolfgang.r.sperr@univie.ac.at']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Int Arch Allergy Immunol,International archives of allergy and immunology,9211652,"['EC 3.4.21.- (Serine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.21.59 (Tryptases)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Biopsy', 'Bone Marrow/immunology/pathology', 'Bone Marrow Neoplasms/diagnosis/*enzymology/metabolism', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Male', 'Mast Cells/enzymology/*immunology/pathology', 'Mastocytosis/*enzymology/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Regression Analysis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Serine Endopeptidases/*blood', 'Statistics, Nonparametric', 'Tryptases']",2002/06/18 10:00,2002/07/24 10:01,['2002/06/18 10:00'],"['2002/06/18 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/07/24 10:01 [medline]', '2002/06/18 10:00 [entrez]']","['59404 [pii]', '10.1159/000059404 [doi]']",ppublish,Int Arch Allergy Immunol. 2002 Jun;128(2):136-41. doi: 10.1159/000059404.,,,,,,,,,"['Copyright 2002 S.

Previous evidence has suggested that although 6-TG exerts a cytotoxic effect through incorporation of 6-thioguanine nucleotides into newly synthesized DNA (DNA-TGN), an important component of the mode of action of 6-MP is inhibition of purine de novo synthesis (PDNS) through the production of S-methyl-thioinosine 5'-monophosphate (MeTIMP), not formed in cells exposed to 6-TG. We have shown that thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) modulates this effect. By transfection of the human TPMT gene using an inducible system to produce a 3.8-fold increase in TPMT activity in the ecdysone receptor 293 embryonic kidney cell line, we demonstrated a 4.4-fold increase in sensitivity to 6-MP. This was associated with a rise in intracellular levels of MeTIMP but a decrease in levels of DNA-TGN. In contrast, induction of TPMT produced a 1.6-fold decrease in sensitivity to 6-TG, a decrease in levels of DNA-TGN, and an increase in levels of methylated thioguanosine monophosphate. Exposure of cells to equitoxic doses of drug showed similar incorporation of DNA-TGN for 6-TG but for 6-MP significantly reduced DNA-TGN in TPMT-induced compared with uninduced cells. For equitoxic doses of 6-MP, equivalent levels of MeTIMP correlated with equivalent amounts of PDNS. These observations suggest that intracellular TGN levels do not give an accurate reflection of cytotoxic potential in patients treated with 6-MP, because different levels of DNA-TGN may be associated with equitoxic effects.","['Coulthard, Sally A', 'Hogarth, Linda A', 'Little, Margaret', 'Matheson, Elizabeth C', 'Redfern, Christopher P F', 'Minto, Lynne', 'Hall, Andrew G']","['Coulthard SA', 'Hogarth LA', 'Little M', 'Matheson EC', 'Redfern CP', 'Minto L', 'Hall AG']","['Leukaemia Research Fund Molecular Pharmacology Specialist Programme, Cancer Research Unit, Medical School, Newcastle University, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, UK.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,"['0 (Nucleic Acid Synthesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Thionucleosides)', ""2133-81-5 (alpha-2'-deoxythioguanosine)"", '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.67 (thiopurine methyltransferase)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)', 'G9481N71RO (Deoxyguanosine)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA/biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Deoxyguanosine/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Gene Expression/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Mercaptopurine/*pharmacology', 'Methyltransferases/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Nucleic Acid Synthesis Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Thioguanine/*pharmacology', 'Thionucleosides/metabolism', 'Transfection']",2002/06/18 10:00,2002/07/13 10:01,['2002/06/18 10:00'],"['2002/06/18 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/07/13 10:01 [medline]', '2002/06/18 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1124/mol.62.1.102 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 2002 Jul;62(1):102-9. doi: 10.1124/mol.62.1.102.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Viral infection in some cell types regulates expression of p53 protein, a key regulator of cell proliferation and death. Therefore, we hypothesized that p53 and its dependent genes may be linked with ts1-mediated neuropathology. We examined the presence of p53 and its dependent gene product, a proapoptotic protein bax-alpha, in ts1-induced spongiform encephalomyelopathy. Compared with controls, the lesions of infected animals contained increased levels of p53 and bax-alpha in astrocytes, as shown by strong nuclear p53 and cytoplasmic bax-alpha immunoreactivity in astrocytes. To determine how ts1 affects p53 expression in astrocytes, we then assessed the expression of p53 and its dependent genes, such as bax-alpha and p21, in infected and uninfected immortalized C1 astrocytes and studied possible pathways responsible for p53 accumulation in infected astrocytes. In these studies using mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitors, infection-induced increases in the p53 level were partially blocked by PD98059, a synthetic inhibitor of MEK1 that is the immediate upstream kinase of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2), but not by SB202190, a potent p38 kinase inhibitor. Furthermore, treatment with PD98059 significantly decreased the level of p21 protein, a p53-dependent gene product. These results suggest that ts1 infection may stabilize p53 protein through activation of ERKs in C1 astrocytes, leading to increased expression of the p21 and bax-alpha proteins, both of which induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Our studies suggest that ts1 neuropathology in mice may result from changes in expression and activity of p53, brought about in part by ts1 activation of ERK.","['Kim, Hun-Taek', 'Tasca, Serban', 'Qiang, Wenan', 'Wong, Paul K Y', 'Stoica, George']","['Kim HT', 'Tasca S', 'Qiang W', 'Wong PK', 'Stoica G']","['Department of Veterinary Pathobiology, Texas A&M University, College Station, Texas.']",['eng'],"['AI28283/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'MH5718/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Lab Invest,Laboratory investigation; a journal of technical methods and pathology,0376617,"['0 (Bax protein, mouse)', '0 (Cdkn1a protein, mouse)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'SJE1IO5E3I (2-(2-amino-3-methoxyphenyl)-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Astrocytes/*metabolism/virology', 'Brain Stem/metabolism/pathology/virology', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'Cyclins/genetics/metabolism', 'Encephalitis, Viral/complications/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Flavonoids/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Experimental/complications/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System', 'Mice', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/*biosynthesis', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*biosynthesis', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/metabolism', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/*metabolism', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein']",2002/06/18 10:00,2002/07/03 10:01,['2002/06/18 10:00'],"['2002/06/18 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/07/03 10:01 [medline]', '2002/06/18 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/01.lab.0000017373.82871.45 [doi]'],ppublish,Lab Invest. 2002 Jun;82(6):693-702. doi: 10.1097/01.lab.0000017373.82871.45.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Leucamie Aique Myeloide Enfant.",2774-82,"PURPOSE: To determine whether the use of maintenance therapy (MT) delivered after intensive induction and consolidation therapy confers any advantage in childhood acute myeloid leukemia (AML). PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 268 children with AML were registered in the Leucamie Aique Myeloide Enfant (LAME) 89/91 protocol. This regimen included an intensive induction phase (mitoxantrone plus cytarabine) and, for patients without allograft, two consolidation courses, one containing timed-sequential high-dose cytarabine, asparaginase, and amsacrine. In the LAME 89 pilot study, patients were given an additional MT consisting of mercaptopurine and cytarabine for 18 months. In the LAME 91 trial, patients were randomized to receive or not receive MT. RESULTS: A total of 241 (90%) of 268 patients achieved a complete remission. The overall survival and event-free survival at 6 years were 60% +/- 6% and 48% +/- 6%, respectively. For the complete responders after consolidation therapy, the 5-year disease-free survival was not significantly different in MT-negative and in MT-positive randomized patients (respectively, 60% +/- 19% v 50% +/- 15%; P =.25), whereas the 5-year overall survival was significantly better in MT-negative randomized patients (81% +/- 13% v 58% +/- 15%; P =.04) due to a higher salvage rate after relapse. CONCLUSION: More than 50% of patients can be cured of AML in childhood. Either drug intensity or each of the induction and postremission phases may have contributed to the outstanding improvement in outcome. Low-dose MT is not recommended. Exposure to this low-dose MT may contribute to clinical drug resistance and treatment failure in patients who experience relapse.","['Perel, Yves', 'Auvrignon, Anne', 'Leblanc, Thierry', 'Vannier, Jean-Pierre', 'Michel, Gerard', 'Nelken, Brigitte', 'Gandemer, Virginie', 'Schmitt, Claudine', 'Lamagnere, Jean-Pierre', 'De Lumley, Lionel', 'Bader-Meunier, Brigitte', 'Couillaud, Gerard', 'Schaison, Gerard', 'Landman-Parker, Judith', 'Thuret, Isabelle', 'Dalle, Jean-Hugues', 'Baruchel, Andre', 'Leverger, Guy']","['Perel Y', 'Auvrignon A', 'Leblanc T', 'Vannier JP', 'Michel G', 'Nelken B', 'Gandemer V', 'Schmitt C', 'Lamagnere JP', 'De Lumley L', 'Bader-Meunier B', 'Couillaud G', 'Schaison G', 'Landman-Parker J', 'Thuret I', 'Dalle JH', 'Baruchel A', 'Leverger G']","[""Unite d'Onco-Hematologie, Departement de Pediatrie, Hopital des Enfants, Groupe Hospitalier Pellegrin, Centres Hospitalo-Universitaires de Bordeaux, France. yves.perel@chu-bordeaux.fr""]",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['00DPD30SOY (Amsacrine)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,"['Amsacrine/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/administration & dosage', 'Mitoxantrone/administration & dosage', 'Prospective Studies', 'Recurrence', 'Treatment Outcome']",2002/06/18 10:00,2002/07/09 10:01,['2002/06/18 10:00'],"['2002/06/18 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/07/09 10:01 [medline]', '2002/06/18 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.2002.07.300 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2002 Jun 15;20(12):2774-82. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2002.07.300.,,,,,,['Group LAME of the French Society of Pediatric Hematology and Immunology'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) represent the best-characterized example of this phenomenon, but the molecular mechanisms responsible for their formation remain obscure. The stem cell leukaemia (SCL) gene encodes a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor with an essential role in specifying HSCs. Here we have addressed the transcriptional hierarchy responsible for HSC formation by characterizing an SCL 3' enhancer that targets expression to HSCs and endothelium and their bipotential precursors, the haemangioblast.

In the traditional disaggregated osteoclast (pit) assay, IL-6 and LIF, but not oncostatin-M, conserved the bone resorption otherwise inhibited by high extracellular [Ca(2+)] (15 mM). It produced a paradoxical, concentration-dependent stimulation of resorption by elevated extracellular Ca(2+). In the micro-isolated single osteoclast resorption assay, IL-6, high [Ca(2+)] or IL-6 plus high [Ca(2+)] all increased pit formation. In contrast, the IL-6 receptor (IL-6R)-specific agonist antibody MT-18 inhibited bone resorption in a concentration-dependent manner (1:500 to 1:500 000). MT-18 triggered cytosolic Ca(2+) signals in fura 2-loaded osteoclasts within approximately 10 min of application. Each cytosolic Ca(2+) transient began with a peak deflection that persisted in Ca(2+)-free, EGTA-containing extracellular medium, consistent with a release of intracellularly stored Ca(2+). This was followed by a sustained elevation of cytosolic [Ca(2+)] that was abolished in Ca(2+)-free medium, as expected from an entry of extracellular Ca(2+), and by the Ca(2+) channel antagonist Ni(2+). The inclusion of either IL-6 or soluble human (sh) IL-6R specifically reversed both the above effects of MT-18, confirming that both effects were specific for the IL-6R. The findings suggest that IL-6R activation by IL-6 stimulates osteoclastic bone resorption either by reversing the inhibitory effect of high extracellular Ca(2+) in stromal-containing systems or itself stimulating bone resorption along with Ca(2+) by micro-isolated osteoclasts. In contrast, activation of the IL-6R by an agonist antibody produces an inhibition of bone resorption and an associated triggering of the cytosolic Ca(2+) signals previously associated with regulation of bone resorptive function in other situations.","['Moonga, B S', 'Adebanjo, O A', 'Wang, H-J', 'Li, S', 'Wu, X B', 'Troen, B', 'Inzerillo, A', 'Abe, E', 'Minkin, C', 'Huang, C L-H', 'Zaidi, M']","['Moonga BS', 'Adebanjo OA', 'Wang HJ', 'Li S', 'Wu XB', 'Troen B', 'Inzerillo A', 'Abe E', 'Minkin C', 'Huang CL', 'Zaidi M']","['The Mount Sinai Bone Program and the Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Bone Diseases, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, NY 10029, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 AG 14917-02/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DE 09965/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,J Endocrinol,The Journal of endocrinology,0375363,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (OSM protein, human)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-6)', '106956-32-5 (Oncostatin M)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', '*Bone Resorption', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Calcium Signaling/*drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytokines/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Cytosol/*metabolism', 'Growth Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/pharmacology', 'Oncostatin M', 'Osteoclasts/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Peptides/pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Receptors, Interleukin-6/immunology/*metabolism']",2002/06/18 10:00,2002/08/10 10:01,['2002/06/18 10:00'],"['2002/06/18 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/10 10:01 [medline]', '2002/06/18 10:00 [entrez]']","['JOE04512 [pii]', '10.1677/joe.0.1730395 [doi]']",ppublish,J Endocrinol. 2002 Jun;173(3):395-405. doi: 10.1677/joe.0.1730395.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: LY cells were X-irradiated (2 Gy). NAD+ was determined in cell extracts by high-pressure liquid chromatography. ADP-ribose polymers were purified and analysed by densitometry after polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Nuclear matrix proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and processed for ADP-ribose polymer blots to estimate their ability to bind poly(ADP-ribose). RESULTS: In the radiosensitive LY-S cells, the constitutive levels of ADP-ribose polymers were twofold higher than in radioresistant LY-R cells, but unresponsive to a challenge with 2 Gy X-rays. The concentrations of NAD+ - the substrate for poly(ADP-ribose) synthesis - were identical in the two cell lines. X-rays (2 Gy) depleted NAD+ only in LY-S cells. These cells also produced shorter poly(ADP-ribose) molecules as compared with LY-R cells. Nuclear matrix preparations of LY-S cells exhibited lower poly(ADP-ribose)-binding capacity than those of LY-R cells. CONCLUSION: The results demonstrate disturbances in the poly ADP-ribosylation response of the radiosensitive LY-S cells and reduced poly(ADP-ribose)-binding affinity of the nuclear matrix of these cells.","['Kleczkowska, H E', 'Malanga, M', 'Szumiel, I', 'Althaus, F R']","['Kleczkowska HE', 'Malanga M', 'Szumiel I', 'Althaus FR']","['Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Zurich-Tierspital, Zurich, Switzerland.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Int J Radiat Biol,International journal of radiation biology,8809243,"['0U46U6E8UK (NAD)', '26656-46-2 (Poly Adenosine Diphosphate Ribose)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Repair', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/pharmacology', 'Leukemia L5178/*metabolism/*radiotherapy', 'Mice', 'NAD/metabolism/radiation effects', 'Nuclear Matrix/drug effects/metabolism/radiation effects', 'Poly Adenosine Diphosphate Ribose/*metabolism/*radiation effects', 'Radiation Tolerance', 'Signal Transduction/radiation effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Ultraviolet Rays']",2002/06/18 10:00,2002/07/19 10:01,['2002/06/18 10:00'],"['2002/06/18 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/07/19 10:01 [medline]', '2002/06/18 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/095530002317577349 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Radiat Biol. 2002 Jun;78(6):527-34. doi: 10.1080/095530002317577349.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Smad5 is a member of the signal transducer family conveying the pleiotropic TGF-gb/BMP cytokine signals with roles in development, cell growth control, and tumor progression. Here we present a study of the Smad5 expression and its functional role in leukemia cell lines as well as in primary CD34+ progenitors of MDS/AML patients and healthy individuals. Consistent Smad5 gene expression in these cell types and the gradual increase in its mRNA and protein levels in a model of induced erythroid differentiation of murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells suggest a role of the gene in hematopoiesis. We show that bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) directs Smad5 activation in human hematopoietic cells, as monitored at the levels of protein phosphorylation, nuclear translocation, and specific transcription response. In vitro induction of normal human CD34+ cells by BMP4 results in significantly increased proliferation of erythroid progenitors (BFU-E) and formation of glycophorin-A+ cells, whereas perturbation of Smad5 expression by antisense oligonucleotides causes significantly decreased rates of BMP4-induced erythroid differentiation. We have not detected any effects of Smad5 inhibition on BMP4-stimulated progenitors of the granulocyteNmacrophage lineage. We propose that the BMP4/Smad5 signal transduction pathway activates hematopoietic differentiation programs that may be impaired in anemia manifestations in MDS and AML patients with Smad5 haploinsufficiency.","['Fuchs, Ota', 'Simakova, Olga', 'Klener, Pavel', 'Cmejlova, Jana', 'Zivny, Jan', 'Zavadil, Jiri', 'Stopka, Tomas']","['Fuchs O', 'Simakova O', 'Klener P', 'Cmejlova J', 'Zivny J', 'Zavadil J', 'Stopka T']","['Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Prague, Czech Republic. fuchs@uhkt.cz']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood Cells Mol Dis,"Blood cells, molecules & diseases",9509932,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (BMP4 protein, human)', '0 (Bmp4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Bone Morphogenetic Protein 4)', '0 (Bone Morphogenetic Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Glycophorins)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (SMAD5 protein, human)', '0 (Smad5 Protein)', '0 (Smad5 protein, mouse)', '0 (Trans-Activators)']",IM,"['Active Transport, Cell Nucleus', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD34', 'Bone Morphogenetic Protein 4', 'Bone Morphogenetic Proteins/*physiology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Differentiation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/*cytology', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Glycophorins/biosynthesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/etiology/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/etiology/metabolism/pathology', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/pharmacology', 'Phosphoproteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smad5 Protein', 'Trans-Activators/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/06/18 10:00,2003/08/06 05:00,['2002/06/18 10:00'],"['2002/06/18 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/06 05:00 [medline]', '2002/06/18 10:00 [entrez]']","['S1079979602904870 [pii]', '10.1006/bcmd.2002.0487 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Cells Mol Dis. 2002 Mar-Apr;28(2):221-33. doi: 10.1006/bcmd.2002.0487.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The vast history of experience of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) with medicinal plants may facilitate the identification of novel antileukemic compounds. In the present investigation, we tested 22 drugs for their activity toward CCRF-CEM cell lines: artesunate, artemisinin, baicalein, baicalin, berberine, bufalin, cantharidin, cephalotaxine, curcumin, daidzein, daidzin, diallyl disulfide, ginsenoside Rh2, glycyrrhizic acid, isonardosinon, homoharringtonine, nardosinon, nardofuran, puerarin, quercetin, tannic acid, and tetrahydronardosinon. As compounds from folk medicinal remedies are sometimes looked upon as alternative medicine with some hesitation or criticism, we investigated only chemically pure compounds and tested the drugs independently in two different laboratories in Germany and Australia. We used CCRF-CEM parental cells and doxorubicin-selected P-glycoprotein (P-gp)/MDR1-expressing CEM/ADR5000, vinblastine-selected P-gp/MDR1-expressing CEM/VLB(100), and epirubicin-selected multidrug resistance-related protein 1 (MRP1)-expressing CEM/E1000 sublines thereof. While CEM/ADR5000, CEM/VLB(100), and CEM/E1000 cells were highly resistant to the corresponding selecting agents, no or only minimal degrees of cross-resistance were observed to TCM drugs in both growth inhibition assay and MTT assay (range from 0.4- to 8-fold). Homoharringtonine, artesunate, and bufalin were most active among this panel of compounds. As shown by flow cytometry, artesunate significantly increased daunorubicin accumulation in CEM/E1000 cells, but not in CEM/VLB(100) or CCRF-CEM parental cells. Bufalin caused a small, but significant increase in daunorubicin accumulation in CEM/VLB(100) and CEM/E1000 cells. As artesunate and bufalin showed both antileukemic activity if applied alone and modulation activity in combination with daunorubicin in multidrug-resistant (MDR) cells, these two drugs may be suitable for novel combination treatment regimens to improve leukemia cell killing.","['Efferth, Thomas', 'Davey, Mary', 'Olbrich, Armin', 'Rucker, Gerhard', 'Gebhart, Erich', 'Davey, Ross']","['Efferth T', 'Davey M', 'Olbrich A', 'Rucker G', 'Gebhart E', 'Davey R']","['Virtual Campus Rhineland-Palatinate, Mainz, Germany. efferth@vcrp.de']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Blood Cells Mol Dis,"Blood cells, molecules & diseases",9509932,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Drugs, Chinese Herbal)', '0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins)', 'Y49M64GZ4Q (multidrug resistance-associated protein 1)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Daunorubicin/pharmacokinetics', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Interactions', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Drugs, Chinese Herbal/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Medicine, Chinese Traditional', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/06/18 10:00,2003/08/06 05:00,['2002/06/18 10:00'],"['2002/06/18 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/06 05:00 [medline]', '2002/06/18 10:00 [entrez]']","['S1079979602904924 [pii]', '10.1006/bcmd.2002.0492 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Cells Mol Dis. 2002 Mar-Apr;28(2):160-8. doi: 10.1006/bcmd.2002.0492.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One of the earliest detectable events in this process is an upregulation of the nuclear receptor for 1,25D3, the vitamin D receptor (nVDR). In contrast, the novel analog of 1,25D3, 1,25-dihydroxy-5,6 trans-16-ene-vitamin D3 (5,6-16D3), which has recently been reported to have low calcium-mobilizing activity in vivo, rapidly induced the expression of CD14, CD11b, and monocyte-specific esterase (MSE), classical markers of the mature monocyte, but upregulated nVDR expression less than 1,25D3. This upregulation was shown to be the result of altered degradation of the nVDR protein, while the levels of nVDR mRNA were constant. Knock-out of nVDR transcriptional activity by a decoy VDRE double-stranded deoxyoligonucleotide, markedly abrogated 1,25D3-induced differentiation, but incompletely inhibited 5,6-16D3-induced differentiation. These findings suggest that the unique ability of 5,6-16D3 to induce cell differentiation but not systemic hypercalcemia, may be due to the activation of pathways which initiate differentiation independently of nVDR.","['Ji, Yan', 'Wang, Xuening', 'Donnelly, Robert J', 'Uskokovic, Milan R', 'Studzinski, George P']","['Ji Y', 'Wang X', 'Donnelly RJ', 'Uskokovic MR', 'Studzinski GP']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, UMD-New Jersey Medical School, Newark 07103, USA.']",['eng'],['R01 CA 44722/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (1,25-dihydroxy-5,6-16-ene-vitamin D3)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Oligonucleotides)', '0 (Receptors, Calcitriol)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Calcitriol/*adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Nucleus/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*drug effects/genetics/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/metabolism/physiopathology', 'Monocytes/cytology/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Oligonucleotides/pharmacology', 'Protein Binding/drug effects/physiology', 'Receptors, Calcitriol/*drug effects/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects/physiology']",2002/06/18 10:00,2002/07/06 10:01,['2002/06/18 10:00'],"['2002/06/18 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/07/06 10:01 [medline]', '2002/06/18 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.10091 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 2002 May;191(2):198-207. doi: 10.1002/jcp.10091.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fifty patients (aged 12-41 years) with CML were enrolled in the study. Thirty-two patients (study group) received the marrow grafts primed with G-CSF at 3 to 4 micro/kg per day for 7 days prior to the marrow harvest, and 18 patients (control group) received the marrow grafts without G-CSF priming. All patients received the same graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis (cyclosporine A and methotrexate) and postgraft G-CSF treatment, 3 to 4 micro/kg daily until the absolute neutrophil counts (ANCs) were >10(9)/L. The primary end points were engraftment and incidence of acute GVHD. The secondary end points were the incidence of chronic GVHD, relapse, and overall disease-free survival. The study and control groups were comparable for age, sex, donor selections, conditioning regimens, and disease status. The median times to both neutrophil and platelet engraftment (ANC > 0.5 x 10(9)/L; platelets > 20 x 10(9)/L) were significantly faster in the study group than in the control group, at 15 versus 21 days (P < .001) and 17.5 versus 24 days (P < .001), respectively. G-CSF donor printing yielded significantly higher numbers of total nuclear cells in the marrow grafts compared to the numbers in the control grafts (7.2 versus 2.9 x 10(8)/kg, P < .001). Similar results were seen for CD34+ (6.1versus 2.7 x 10(6)/kg, P < .001) and colony-forming unit-granulocyte/macrophage (CFU-GM) cells (68 versus 16 x 10(4)/kg, P < .001). The incidence of grades II to IV acute GVHD was surprisingly low in the study group: only 2 (6.3%) of 32 transplantation patients in the study group developed grade II acute GVHD, limited to the skin, whereas 5 (27.8%) of 18 patients in the control group developed grades II to IV acute GVHD (P = .032). G-CSF priming did not change the total numbers of CD3+ cells in the marrow grafts but lowered CD4+ cells and increased CD8+ cells, resulting in a significant reduction of CD4:CD8 ratio (P = .018). Six patients in the study group developed chronic GVHD either during or after cyclosporine taper. There were no significant differences in chronic GVHD (24% versus 33.3%), relapse rates (12.5% versus 11.1%), and overall survival rates (78.1% versus 66.7%, P = .32) between the study and control groups during a median follow-up period of 24 months (range, 6-50 months). There was, however, a trend in favor of improved chronic GVHD and disease-free survival in the study group. We conclude that G-CSF donor-marrow priming accelerates both neutrophil and platelet engraftment and is associated with a very low incidence of grades II to IV acute GVHD in CML patients after HLA-matched sibling marrow transplantation.","['Ji, Shu-Quan', 'Chen, Hui-Ren', 'Wang, Hang-Xiang', 'Yan, Hong-Ming', 'Pan, Shi-Ping', 'Xun, Chang-Qing']","['Ji SQ', 'Chen HR', 'Wang HX', 'Yan HM', 'Pan SP', 'Xun CQ']","[""Research Center for Hematology, Air Force General Hospital, Beijing, People's Republic of China. jishuquan@263.net""]",['eng'],['CA91795-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,"['0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '6WS4C399GB (Lenograstim)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*methods', 'Child', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Graft Survival/drug effects', 'Graft vs Host Disease/prevention & control', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization/*methods', 'Humans', 'Lenograstim', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*therapy', 'Male', 'Prospective Studies', 'Recombinant Proteins/*administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation, Homologous/methods', 'Treatment Outcome']",2002/06/18 10:00,2003/07/12 05:00,['2002/06/18 10:00'],"['2002/06/18 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/12 05:00 [medline]', '2002/06/18 10:00 [entrez]']","['S1083879102500367 [pii]', '10.1053/bbmt.2002.v8.pm12064363 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2002;8(5):261-7. doi: 10.1053/bbmt.2002.v8.pm12064363.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Donor leukocyte infusion (DLI) for treatment of leukaemic relapse after BMT can induce durable remissions. DLI causes GvHD in the majority of the responding patients. However, a GvL effect may be present without evidence of GvHD and vise versa. The importance of alloreactivity for the treatment outcome prompted the interest for a predictive test of alloreactivity. Interleukin 2 (IL-2) producing helper T lymphocyte precursor (HTLp) frequencies determined by limiting dilution analysis (LDA) in the graft-versus-host direction were explored. The HTLp assay was optimized and the sources of error minimized to ensure sensitive and reproducible results. The IL-2 dependent cell line, CTLL-2 was optimized to detect 0.6 pg IL-2. UV-B irradiation of the cells was demonstrated to effectively terminate proliferation of the responder cells and thus allow IL-2 to be detected in the whole culture volume. The design of the assay was explored by Monte Carlo simulations resulting in a design yielding frequencies with a coefficient of variation of 20% in the range of 1:20,000-1:1,000,000. The influence of autoreactivity of the donor and recipient cells was minimized as well as the risk of the stimulator cells producing IL-2. The HTLp frequencies correlated with the degree of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) disparity and the assays were able to detect minor histocompatibility antigen mismatches. The HTLp frequencies of 28 HLA-identical sibling BMT pairs and 20 HLA-matched unrelated and partially HLA-matched related BMT pairs were determined. HTLp frequencies from the HLA-identical sibling BMT pairs had a median of 1:557,362 (range 1:9.511 to < 1:2,500,000). The HTLp frequencies from the HLA-matched unrelated and partially HLA-matched related BMT pairs had a median of 1:88,110 (range 1:4.139-1:736,123). Analysis of the HLA-identical sibling BMT pairs in a high and a low HTLp frequency group above and below 1:500,000 showed a trend towards a higher risk of acute GvHD > or = grade II and a significantly higher risk of chronic GvHD in the high HTLp frequency group. This group had a significantly lower risk of relapse as well as a significantly better overall survival and leukaemia free survival. The HLA-matched unrelated and partially HLA-matched related BMT pairs were split evenly in a high and a low HTLp frequency group above and below 1:90,000. There was a significantly higher risk of acute GvHD > or = grade II and a trend towards a higher treatment related mortality (TRM) in the high HTLp frequency group. There were no differences in chronic GvHD, risk of relapse, overall survival and leukaemia free survival. Analyzing all 48 patients the risk of acute GvHD > or = grade II and TRM was significantly higher with HTLp frequencies > 1:100,000 and there was a trend towards a higher risk of relapse with low HTLp frequencies < 1:400,000. Patients in the intermediate HTLp frequency group 1:100,000-1:400,000 had a trend towards improved survival. The HTLp frequency seems to detect clinically significant differences in alloreactivity, that can be useful in donor selection, graft-engineering, T cell add-back and the pharmacological immunosuppression used after BMT.","['Russell, Charlotte Astrid']",['Russell CA'],"['Department of Haematology, H:S Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Denmark,Dan Med Bull,Danish medical bulletin,0066040,"['0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (Interleukin-2)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow Transplantation/*immunology', 'Graft Rejection/immunology', 'Graft vs Host Disease/diagnosis/immunology', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/immunology', 'HLA Antigens/analysis', 'Histocompatibility', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Tests', 'Interleukin-2/*metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes, Helper-Inducer/*immunology/metabolism', 'Transplantation, Homologous/immunology']",2002/06/18 10:00,2002/11/26 04:00,['2002/06/18 10:00'],"['2002/06/18 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/11/26 04:00 [medline]', '2002/06/18 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Dan Med Bull. 2002 May;49(2):89-108.,,,,,,,228,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Gene expression profiling using DNA microarrays promises to dramatically enhance molecular diagnosis by quantitating gene expression in tumor cells on a genomic scale.

In DLBCL, germinal center B-like (GCB) and activated B-cell-like (ABC) subgroups differ in the expression of more than 1,000 genes and have a markedly different clinical outcome, suggesting that this diagnostic category includes at least two distinct molecular diseases. In CLL, by contrast, all cases express a characteristic set of genes, suggesting that CLL should be considered a single disease. Nonetheless, two subtypes of CLL exist that are distinguished by the presence or absence of immunoglobulin gene mutations, by the expression of approximately 175 genes, and by clinical course. Clinical translation of these results should be implemented initially in clinical trials where gene expression profiles could identify subsets of patients that are particularly responsive to the therapies being evaluated. As the armamentarium of molecularly targeted therapies expands, molecular diagnosis will be seen as an integral component of clinical management.","['Rosenwald, Andreas', 'Staudt, Louis M']","['Rosenwald A', 'Staudt LM']","['Metabolism Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Semin Oncol,Seminars in oncology,0420432,,IM,"['*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics', 'Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/genetics', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/genetics', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis']",2002/06/14 10:00,2002/07/03 10:01,['2002/06/14 10:00'],"['2002/06/14 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/07/03 10:01 [medline]', '2002/06/14 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0093775402501810 [pii]', '10.1053/sonc.2002.32901 [doi]']",ppublish,Semin Oncol. 2002 Jun;29(3):258-63. doi: 10.1053/sonc.2002.32901.,,,,,,,22,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To investigate the potential therapeutic usage of As2O3 in cervical cancer and its possible mechanisms, human cervical cancer cell line HeLa was employed. The cells underwent apoptosis in response to As2O3, accompanied by a decrease of mitochondrial membrane potential and caspase-3 activation. Overexpression of Bcl-2, however, prevented the dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential, subsequently protecting the cells from As2O3-induced apoptosis. As2O3 increased cellular content of reactive oxygen species (ROS), especially hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and the antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine completely suppressed As2O3-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, incubation of the cells with catalase resulted in significant suppression of As2O3-induced apoptosis. The above results indicate that the induction of HeLa cell apoptosis by As2O3 involved an early decrease in cellular mitochondrial membrane potential and increase in ROS content, predominantly H2O2, followed by caspase-3 activation and DNA fragmentation.","['Woo, Sang Hyeok', 'Park, In-Chul', 'Park, Myung-Jin', 'Lee, Hyung-Chahn', 'Lee, Su-Jae', 'Chun, Yong-Jin', 'Lee, Seung-Hoon', 'Hong, Seok-Il', 'Rhee, Chang Hun']","['Woo SH', 'Park IC', 'Park MJ', 'Lee HC', 'Lee SJ', 'Chun YJ', 'Lee SH', 'Hong SI', 'Rhee CH']","['Laboratory of Cell Biology, Korea Cancer Center Hospital, Seoul 139-706, Korea.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'EC 1.11.1.6 (Catalase)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)', 'WYQ7N0BPYC (Acetylcysteine)']",IM,"['Acetylcysteine/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Antioxidants/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Catalase/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Activation', 'HeLa Cells/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/metabolism', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects/physiology', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects']",2002/06/14 10:00,2002/12/03 04:00,['2002/06/14 10:00'],"['2002/06/14 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/03 04:00 [medline]', '2002/06/14 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2002 Jul;21(1):57-63.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As a novel anticancer agent for the treatment of solid cancer, As2O3 is promising, but no experimental investigations of its efficacy on glioblastoma have been conducted at concentrations that may be achieved clinically. In addition, the cell proliferation and cell cycle regulating mechanism of As2O3 has not yet to be clarified, especially in solid cancers. We investigated the effect of As2O3 on proliferation and cell cycle regulation with change in cyclins in two human glioblastoma cell lines differing in p53 status (U87MG-wt; T98G-mutated). Sensitivity to As2O3 varied depending on the dose with the IC50 of the U87MG and T98G cells being 1.78 and 3.55 microM, respectively. Analysis by laser scanning cytometry (LSC) indicated that As2O3 inhibited the proliferation of the two cell lines via cell cycle arrest both at the G1 and G2 phases. To address the mechanism of the antiproliferative effect of As2O3, we examined its effect on cell cycle-related proteins by means of LSC, confocal microscopy and Western blot analysis. As2O3 induced an increase in p53 level and a decrease in level of cyclin B1 combined with cell arrest at G2/M in both cell lines. Cell arrest in G1, however, was associated with a decline in cyclin D1 expression only in the wt U87MG cells. As2O3 also induced apoptosis of U87MG cells as evidenced by the presence of cells with fractional DNA content ( cell populations). The present evidence that As2O3 at relatively low concentration effectively inhibited proliferation of U87MG and T98G cells in vitro, suggests that the drug may be considered for in vivo testing on animal models and possibly clinical trials on glioma patients.","['Zhao, Shiguang', 'Tsuchida, Takahiro', 'Kawakami, Katsuhiro', 'Shi, Changbin', 'Kawamoto, Keiji']","['Zhao S', 'Tsuchida T', 'Kawakami K', 'Shi C', 'Kawamoto K']","['Department of Neurosurgery, Kansai Medical University, Moriguchi city, Osaka 570-8506, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (CCNB1 protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin B)', '0 (Cyclin B1)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Brain Neoplasms/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Cycle/*drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cyclin B/*metabolism', 'Cyclin B1', 'Cyclin D1/*metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Glioblastoma/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*metabolism']",2002/06/14 10:00,2002/12/03 04:00,['2002/06/14 10:00'],"['2002/06/14 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/03 04:00 [medline]', '2002/06/14 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2002 Jul;21(1):49-55.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rhodamine 123 (Rho) is one of the substrates of P-glycoprotein (Pgp), and the presence of active Pgp can be shown by the efflux of Rho. Rho can also be used to measure the mitochondrial transmembrane potential (energy state) of a cell. We reasoned that selection of hematopoietic progenitors using a combination of Rho efflux and phenotypic markers might be superior to use of phenotypic markers alone. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used the myeloid-lymphoid initiating cell (ML-IC) assay as functional measure of primitive progenitors. Umbilical cord blood CD34(+)CD33(-)CD38(-), CD34(+)CD33(-)CD38(-)Rho(-), and CD34(+)CD33(-)CD38(-)Rho(-)c-kit(+) cells were sorted singly onto AFT024 feeders to assess their capacity to become ML-IC. RESULTS: The frequency of ML-IC in CD34(+)CD33(-)CD38(-)Rho(-) cells was significantly higher (15 +/- 0.4%) than that in CD34(+)CD33(-)CD38(-) cells (6.2 +/- 0.9%, p < 0.05). However, the frequency of long-term culture-initiating cells (LTC-IC) (17 +/- 3% vs 12 +/- 1.5%) and natural killer culture-initiating cells (NK-IC) (25 +/- 3% vs 20 +/- 4%) was similar in the two populations. Following the treatment of CD34(+)CD33(-)CD38(-)Rho(-) cells with verapamil, which blocks Pgp function, no increase in ML-IC was detected compared with CD34(+)CD33(-)CD38(-) cells (6 +/- 0.7%), suggesting that differences in the energy state, which is reflected by Rho staining after verapamil treatment, cannot be used as a criterion to identify human HSC. Further selection of CD34(+)CD33(-)CD38(-)Rho(-) cells based on expression of c-kit significantly increased the frequency of ML-IC, LTC-IC and NK-IC by 1.75-, 1.3-, and 1.8-fold, respectively. CONCLUSION: Combining the function of Pgp and phenotypic features of hematopoietic progenitors enriches the frequency of cord blood ML-IC to greater than 25%. Use of such enriched populations will allow us to characterize the biological behavior of human HSC.","['Liu, Hsingjin', 'Verfaillie, Catherine M']","['Liu H', 'Verfaillie CM']","['Division of Hematology, Oncology and Transplantation, Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis 55455, USA.']",['eng'],['P01-CA-65493-6/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Annexin A5)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (CD33 protein, human)', '0 (Cd33 protein, mouse)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Rhodamines)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (CD38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (Cd38 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (NAD+ Nucleosidase)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase', 'ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1', 'Animals', 'Annexin A5/analysis', 'Antigens, CD/*analysis', 'Antigens, CD34/*analysis', 'Antigens, Differentiation/*analysis', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/*analysis', 'Apoptosis', 'Biomarkers/analysis', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Fetal Blood/*cytology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/blood', 'Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Mice', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins/analysis', 'NAD+ Nucleosidase/*analysis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/*analysis', 'Rhodamines/pharmacokinetics', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3', 'Stromal Cells/cytology']",2002/06/14 10:00,2002/07/12 10:01,['2002/06/14 10:00'],"['2002/06/14 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/07/12 10:01 [medline]', '2002/06/14 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0301472X02007968 [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-472x(02)00796-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2002 Jun;30(6):582-9. doi: 10.1016/s0301-472x(02)00796-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used a PCR-based loss of heterozygosity (LOH) assay to map the chr2-CDR in AML cells isolated from F1 hybrid mice (BALB/cJ x CBA/CaJ) which developed AML following exposure to a single dose of 3 Gy of 137Cs gamma rays. A total of 30 polymorphic microsatellite markers, mapping within or close to chr2(D-E), were used under optimized PCR conditions that generate a single major band for each marker on a nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel. RESULTS: Detailed LOH mapping identified two distinct AML-CDRs: one localized to a 4.6 centiMorgan (cM) interval between markers D2Mit272 and D2Mit394; the other mapped to a 0.8 cM interval between markers D2Mit276 and D2Mit444. Both CDRs span the mouse chr2E region. CONCLUSION: The data present, for the first time, evidence for two distinctly noncontiguous CDRs on mouse chr2 harboring gene(s) involved in AML development. These CDRs are orthologous to human chromosomes 11p11-13 and 15q11-15 that have been implicated in subsets of AML.

We enrolled 34 recipients of an allogeneic HSCT in three consecutive trials to determine the optimal utilization of recombinant human erythropoietin (rhEpo) therapy in this setting. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the first trial (n = 7), rhEpo 1400 U/kg/week was given from day 1 until a hemoglobin (Hb) level of 10 g/dL was achieved, for a maximum of 60 days. In the second trial, rhEpo 500 U/kg/week was given to achieve Hb levels of 13 to 14 g/dL in 13 anemic patients with fatigue 56 to 1440 days after transplant. In the third trial, rhEpo was scheduled to start on day 35 in 14 patients at a dose of 500 U/kg/week with the aim of achieving Hb levels of 13 to 14 g/dL. RESULTS: In trial 1, erythroid recovery to 1% reticulocytes and red blood cell transfusion independence were faster, but the number of transfusions was not reduced compared to 10 controls. Responses were brisk in trial 2, with transfusion independence achieved after a median of 1 week in 12 of 13 patients, and 2-g Hb increments or Hb values of 11, 12, and 13 g/dL after 6, 7, 10, and 10 weeks, respectively. Transfusions were significantly reduced in the first month of rhEpo therapy. In trial 3, transfusion independence was obtained after a median of 1 week in 13 of 14 patients, and 2-g Hb increments or Hb values of 11, 12, and 13 g/dL after 3, 4, 6, and 8 weeks, respectively. Transfusions rates were considerably reduced compared to the previous month in the same patients or compared to controls undergoing peripheral blood or marrow transplant without rhEpo. CONCLUSIONS: Anemia after allogeneic HSCT is exquisitely sensitive to rhEpo. The benefit is minimal when it is given early post-transplant, as used in all trials to date. However, the rate of major response is greater than 90% when rhEpo is started after day 35. These data provide the basis on which to conduct a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of rhEpo therapy after allogeneic HSCT.","['Baron, Frederic', 'Sautois, Brieuc', 'Baudoux, Etienne', 'Matus, Geoffrey', 'Fillet, Georges', 'Beguin, Yves']","['Baron F', 'Sautois B', 'Baudoux E', 'Matus G', 'Fillet G', 'Beguin Y']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology, University of Liege, Liege, Belgium.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anemia, Aplastic/therapy', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Cyclosporine/therapeutic use', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Erythropoietin/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/epidemiology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/therapy', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Thrombocytosis/therapy', 'Transplantation, Homologous/*physiology']",2002/06/14 10:00,2002/07/12 10:01,['2002/06/14 10:00'],"['2002/06/14 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/07/12 10:01 [medline]', '2002/06/14 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0301472X02007956 [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-472x(02)00795-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2002 Jun;30(6):546-54. doi: 10.1016/s0301-472x(02)00795-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

IR exposure directly damages hematopoietic stem cells and alters the capacity of bone marrow stromal elements to support and/or maintain hematopoiesis in vivo and in vitro. Exposure to IR induces dose-dependent declines in circulating hematopoietic cells not only through reduced bone marrow production, but also by redistribution and apoptosis of mature formed elements of the blood. Recently, the importance of using lymphocyte depletion kinetics to provide a ""crude"" dose estimate has been emphasized, particularly in rapid assessment of large numbers of individuals who may be exposed to IR through acts of terrorism or by accident. A practical strategy to estimate radiation dose and triage victims based upon clinical symptomatology is presented. An explosion of knowledge has occurred regarding molecular and cellular pathways that trigger and mediate hematologic responses to IR. In addition to damaging DNA, IR alters gene expression and transcription, and interferes with intracellular and intercellular signaling pathways. The clinical expression of these disturbances may be the development of leukemia, the most significant hematologic complication of IR exposure among survivors of the atomic bomb detonations over Japan. Those at greatest risk for leukemia are individuals exposed during childhood. The association of leukemia with chronic, low-dose-rate exposure from nuclear power plant accidents and/or nuclear device testing has been more difficult to establish, due in part to lack of precision and sensitivity of methods to assess doses that approach background radiation dose. Nevertheless, multiple myeloma may be associated with chronic exposure, particularly in those exposed at older ages.","['Dainiak, Nicholas']",['Dainiak N'],"['Department of Medicine, Bridgeport Hospital, Yale University School of Medicine, Bridgeport, Conn. 06610, USA. pndain@bpthosp.org']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,,IM,"['Cell Survival/radiation effects', 'Hematologic Diseases/*etiology', 'Humans', 'Radiation Injuries/*diagnosis', '*Radiation, Ionizing', 'Radioactive Hazard Release']",2002/06/14 10:00,2002/07/12 10:01,['2002/06/14 10:00'],"['2002/06/14 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/07/12 10:01 [medline]', '2002/06/14 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0301472X02008020 [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-472x(02)00802-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2002 Jun;30(6):513-28. doi: 10.1016/s0301-472x(02)00802-0.,,,,,,,199,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Oncostatin M can activate two related receptors, one consisting of a low-affinity LIF receptor subunit, LIFR beta, which forms a heterocomplex with the gp130 signal transducing protein and can recognize both oncostatin M and LIF, and a second heterocomplex consisting of a subunit that specifically recognizes oncostatin M, OSMR beta, and the gp130 protein. By immunohistochemistry, 25 of 25 ovarian carcinomas examined expressed the LIFR beta subunit in the malignant epithelial cells (all samples express gp130), and two-thirds the ovarian carcinomas studied expressed OSMR beta mRNA as determined by RT-PCR. Thus oncostatin M and its receptors are commonly coexpressed in malignant ovarian epithelial cells, and represent a potential autocrine loop in this tumor type. STAT3, of one the signaling proteins downstream of the oncostatin M/LIF receptors, was found in its phosphorylated, activated form (phosphotyrosine 705 STAT3) in the malignant epithelial cells of 17 of 23 ovarian carcinomas examined (74%) as determined by immunohistochemistry; this suggests that this protein is constitutively activated in most ovarian carcinomas, as it is in many other human malignancies. Recombinant human Oncostatin M (rhOSM) can induce the transient tyrosine 705 phosphorylation of STAT3 in serum-starved LIFR beta/OSMR beta expressing ovarian carcinoma cell lines, but does not alter cell growth and effects only a modest increase in the apoptotic rate in these cultured cells. Oncostatin M and its receptors may be part of a network of cytokine systems within ovarian carcinomas that may act to maintain STAT3 in its activated form, a phenomenon associated with the malignant phenotype.","['Savarese, Todd M', 'Campbell, Cara L', 'McQuain, Catherine', 'Mitchell, Kathryn', 'Guardiani, Rachel', 'Quesenberry, Peter J', 'Nelson, Beth E']","['Savarese TM', 'Campbell CL', 'McQuain C', 'Mitchell K', 'Guardiani R', 'Quesenberry PJ', 'Nelson BE']","['Cytokine/Cytokine Receptor LINK Laboratory, Cancer Center, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, 01655, USA.

Exposure of U937 cells to 1 mM SB and 1 nM PMA (24 h) markedly induced caspase activation and apoptosis, events accompanied by impaired differentiation induction (e.g., reduced plastic adherence and diminished expression of CD11b) as well as reduced clonogenic survival. The PKC inhibitor GF109203X blocked SB-/PMA-mediated apoptosis. Comparable results were obtained in HL-60 cells. Apoptosis was associated with early procaspase 8 activation and Bid cleavage, accompanied by pronounced mitochondrial damage (e.g., loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsi(m)) and cytochrome c release). Neutralization of endogenous TNFalpha by a human soluble TNF receptor substantially blocked SB-/PMA-induced cytochrome c release and apoptosis. Consistent with this, ectopic expression of a mutant dominant-negative caspase 8 or CrmA resulted in a significant decrease in SB-/PMA-induced apoptosis, whereas Bcl-2 overexpression did not. SB/PMA treatment also triggered a decline in the S and G(2)M populations, and dephosphorylation of p34(cdc2). These results indicate that SB interacts with low concentrations of PMA to induce apoptosis in human leukemia cells and that this process proceeds through a PKC-/TNFalpha-dependent pathway in which procaspase 8 and Bid activation play key roles.","['Rahmani, Mohamed', 'Dai, Yun', 'Grant, Steven']","['Rahmani M', 'Dai Y', 'Grant S']","['Department of Medicine, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond 23298, USA.']",['eng'],"['CA 63753/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 83705/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '107-92-6 (Butyric Acid)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Butyric Acid/*pharmacology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects/metabolism/physiology', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*metabolism', 'U937 Cells']",2002/06/14 10:00,2002/08/10 10:01,['2002/06/14 10:00'],"['2002/06/14 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/10 10:01 [medline]', '2002/06/14 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1006/excr.2002.5548 [doi]', 'S0014482702955485 [pii]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 2002 Jul 1;277(1):31-47. doi: 10.1006/excr.2002.5548.,,,,,,,,,['(c) 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Commonly diagnosed malignancies during pregnancy include breast cancer, cervical carcinoma, melanoma and lymphoma. Chemotherapy is usually necessary for optimal treatment, especially in patients with leukaemia and lymphoma. Concerns arise regarding the effects of imaging modalities in the pregnant cancer patients and the effects of chemotherapeutic agents on the developing fetus. METHODS: A Medline search of articles describing haematologic malignancies in pregnant patients was performed. Particular attention was paid to the kind of malignancy, stage of pregnancy, the types and side effects of chemotherapeutic agents used and the outcome of the pregnancy. RESULTS: There is no entirely safe cytotoxic drug or timing of exposure for the developing fetus. The administration of chemotherapy during pregnancy will not always produce a poor outcome. A pregnant cancer patient can also be safely and reasonably staged with imaging. Magnetic resonance imaging will most often be the procedure of choice as it does not use ionising radiation. CONCLUSIONS: The management of each pregnant patient diagnosed with a malignancy has to be highly individualized and involves a multidisciplinary team of medical personnel. The patient and her family need counselling regarding the diagnosis, long-term prognosis, options of termination of pregnancy, choice of chemotherapeutic agents and their effects on the fetus and pregnancy.","['Wong, G C']",['Wong GC'],"['Department of Haematology, Singapore General Hospital, Outram Road, Singapore 169608.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Singapore,Ann Acad Med Singap,"Annals of the Academy of Medicine, Singapore",7503289,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Cause of Death', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/diagnosis/epidemiology/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maternal Mortality', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Patient Care Team', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications, Hematologic/diagnosis/epidemiology/*therapy', 'Pregnancy Complications, Neoplastic/diagnosis/epidemiology/*therapy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Prognosis', 'Radiotherapy/adverse effects/methods', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Ultrasonography, Prenatal']",2002/06/14 10:00,2002/11/26 04:00,['2002/06/14 10:00'],"['2002/06/14 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/11/26 04:00 [medline]', '2002/06/14 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Ann Acad Med Singap. 2002 May;31(3):303-10.,,,,,,,48,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, hypericin, a component of Hypericum p. extracts, exhibits light-dependent phototoxic properties and can be used in phototherapy. We therefore investigated the cytotoxic activity of two total Hypericum p. extracts, namely from fresh and dried plants in the dark and after exposure to 7.5 J/cm2 white light illumination and compared it with the effect of hypericin on K562, U937, LN229 glioblastoma cell lines and normal human astrocytes. The chemical toxicity of non-illuminated Hypericum p. extracts in the cells tested is low as expressed by a LC50 between 1.9-4.1 mg/ml, which corresponds to 10.3-17.3 microM hypericin and 114.4-190.7 microM hyperforin after 48 h treatment. Hypericum p. extracts induced dose-dependent growth arrest of human malignant cells in the absence of illumination with GI50 values between 0.43-1.77 mg/ml (2.3-9.7 microM hypericin, 26.1-106.7 microM hyperforin) for the fresh plant extract and 0.59-3.03 mg/ml (2.5-12.8 microM hypericin, 24.2-124.7 microM hyperforin) for the dried extract. The growth inhibitory effect of fresh Hypericum p. extract was more pronounced in leukemia cell lines K562 and U937, the GI50 concentrations being about 7-fold lower than the corresponding LC50 for the cell lines K562 and U937, but almost the same as the LC50 for LN229 and NHA cells. GI50 (microgram/ml) for tumor cell lines K562 and U937 (432 and 799) established after 48 h differed significantly (p < 0.05) from those of LN229 and normal human astrocytes (1767 and 2900). The light-exposed extracts were more toxic, their LC50 and GI50 values were reduced to values corresponding to LC50 concentration of 3.7-7.4 microM and a GI50 of 1.3-3.5 microM for phototoxic hypericin. After exposure to light, there was a significant difference (p = 0.006) between the GI50 of glioblastoma LN229 cells (582 micrograms/ml) and normal human astrocytes (1050 micrograms/ml). Morphological examination by light microscopy and phosphaditylserine exposure on the outer plasma membrane investigated by Annexin V-binding with flow cytometry after 24 h confirmed that Hypericum p. extracts caused apoptosis of treated cells without exposure to light. Hypericum p. extracts derived from fresh herbs and from dried herbs which differ in their levels of phloroglucinols (hyperforin and adhyperforin) were compared. The hyperforin content of fresh St. John's wort extract exceeded that of dried plant extract by 47% and the GI50 values of fresh plant extract were 73%, 77% and 58% of those established for dried extract in the three malignant cell lines K562, U937 and LN229 in the dark (p < 0.05). Under white light (7.5 J/cm2), both extracts exerted comparable growth inhibitory and apoptosis inducing effects due to the phototoxicity of hypericin, the corresponding concentrations of which were in the range of 1.3-3.5 microM. The data reported in this study suggest that illumination is not essential for the growth inhibitory and apoptotic effects of Hypericum p. extracts, but light activation potentiates them. Furthermore, the constituent hyperforin is at least partly responsible for these effects in the dark.","['Hostanska, K', 'Reichling, J', 'Bommer, S', 'Weber, M', 'Saller, R']","['Hostanska K', 'Reichling J', 'Bommer S', 'Weber M', 'Saller R']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital Zurich, Switzerland.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Pharmazie,Die Pharmazie,9800766,"['0 (Annexin A5)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Coloring Agents)', '0 (Phosphatidylserines)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Solvents)', '3K9958V90M (Ethanol)', 'I223NX31W9 (Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate)']",IM,"['Annexin A5', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Astrocytes/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Membrane/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Coloring Agents', 'Ethanol', 'Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate', 'Hypericum/*chemistry', 'Light', 'Phosphatidylserines/pharmacology', 'Plant Extracts', 'Solvents', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/06/14 10:00,2002/07/16 10:01,['2002/06/14 10:00'],"['2002/06/14 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/07/16 10:01 [medline]', '2002/06/14 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Pharmazie. 2002 May;57(5):323-31.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The authors analyzed a group of 45 patients with CD25-positive hairy cell leukaemia treated with cladribine. In addition to the therapeutic response they evaluated also the state of cellular immunity during the subsequent months and years following cladribine administration.

However, long-term treatment with Interferon alfa (IFN alpha) can produce or exacerbate immune-mediated complications (IMC). The purpose of this study was to analyze the experience with IMC in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) undergoing IFN alpha treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The occurrence of IMC was evaluated in 76 patients (47 male; 29 female) with Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-positive CML. The median of age was 45 years and the duration of disease was 3.9 years. Diagnostic criteria of IMC were performed in patients with sign and symptoms suggestive of particular disorders. RESULTS: Well-documented and clinically evident complications developed in 7 patients after a median of 19 months (range 1-84) of IFN alpha treatment. These included 9.2% patients with Ph-positive CML treated with IFN alpha-containing regimens. Hypothyroidism (H) occurred in 1 patient (1.3%), immune-mediated hemolysis (HEM) in 2 patients (2.6%) and connective tissue disorders (CTD) in 4 patients (5.3%) [2-SLE, 1-Raynad's syndrome and 1-mixed connective tissue syndrome (MCTS)]. IFN alpha was discontinued in 3 patients and the dose was reduced in 2 patients. Five of 7 patients (75%) with immune-mediated complications had some degree of cytogenetic response at the time of the event. The association with female sex was strong and significant (86% vs 33.6%, x2; 48; p = 0.02). CONCLUSION: The frequency of IMC of clinical relevance with interferon alfa therapy in CML increased (long-term therapy). The patients treated with interferon alfa should be monitored for sign and symptoms of autoimmunity.","['Tothova, E', 'Stecova, N', 'Kafkova, A', 'Fricova, M', 'Svorcova, E']","['Tothova E', 'Stecova N', 'Kafkova A', 'Fricova M', 'Svorcova E']","['Klinika hematologie LF UPJS a FNsP, Kosice, Slovenska republika.']",['slo'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Czech Republic,Vnitr Lek,Vnitrni lekarstvi,0413602,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Autoimmune Diseases/*chemically induced', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",2002/06/14 10:00,2002/08/09 10:01,['2002/06/14 10:00'],"['2002/06/14 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/09 10:01 [medline]', '2002/06/14 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Vnitr Lek. 2002 May;48(5):380-3.,,,,,Vyskyt autoimunitnych komplikacii u chorych s chronickou myelocytovou leukemiou pocas liecby s interferonom alfa.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the trials BFM-A (Austria) 81 and ALL A 84, treatment stratification was performed using a risk factor, which was calculated from the initial peripheral blast cell count, and size of liver and spleen. In the following studies (BFM-A 86, 90 and 95) early response to a 7-day systemic mono-therapy with prednisone (as measured by the peripheral blast cell count) was used as an overriding stratification factor; in order to reduce the need for cranial radiotherapy, all patients received high-dose methotrexate (5 g/m2) for preventive central nervous system treatment. Event-free survival (EFS) rates increased from study BFM-A 81 (n = 141, probability (p) of EFS: 59% +/- 4%) and study ALL A 84 (n = 127, pEFS: 67% +/- 4%) to 77% +/- 4% in trial BFM-A 86 (n = 142), 79% +/- 3% in trial BFM-A 90 (n = 256), and 84% +/- 3% in trial BFM-A 95 (n = 224). However, the prognosis for high-risk patients has not significantly improved within the last 20 years (pEFS: 50%). Furthermore, conventional risk factors such as leukocyte count and age at time of diagnosis, could not be used to indicate patients in the low and intermediate risk group who might eventually relapse. Thus, in trial BFM-A 2000, detection of minimal residual disease by polymerase chain reaction-based methods after 5 and 12 weeks of therapy was introduced for treatment stratification. Minimal residual disease was prospectively shown to predict relapses more precisely and, as a matter of fact, may allow a more exact definition of which patients are at risk and which patients belong to the subgroup with a good prognosis despite reduced treatment.","['Attarbaschi, Andishe', 'Mann, Georg', 'Dworzak, Michael', 'Urban, Christian', 'Fink, Franz-Martin', 'Dieckmann, Karin', 'Riehm, Hansjorg', 'Gadner, Helmut']","['Attarbaschi A', 'Mann G', 'Dworzak M', 'Urban C', 'Fink FM', 'Dieckmann K', 'Riehm H', 'Gadner H']","[""St. Anna Children's Hospital, Vienna.""]",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Austria,Wien Klin Wochenschr,Wiener klinische Wochenschrift,21620870R,,IM,"['Adolescent', '*Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols', 'Austria', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Multicenter Studies as Topic', 'Neoplasm, Residual/drug therapy/mortality', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk']",2002/06/14 10:00,2002/10/03 04:00,['2002/06/14 10:00'],"['2002/06/14 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/10/03 04:00 [medline]', '2002/06/14 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Wien Klin Wochenschr. 2002 Feb 28;114(4):148-57.,,,,['Wien Klin Wochenschr. 2002 Feb 28;114(4):141-2.

STB1 and STB2 are tetra-membrane-spanning proteins with 73.1% total-amino-acid identity. Serine-rich domain and Strabismus-homology (STH1 and STH2) domains are conserved among human STB1, STB2, Xenopus Stbm, and Drosophila Stbm. STH2 domain with the C-terminal Ser/Thr-X-Val motif is implicated in binding with Dishevelled (DVL) proteins. STB1 gene is clustered with CASQ1 gene on human chromosome 1q21-q23, while STB2 gene is clustered with CASQ2 gene on human chromosome 1p13. STB1 and STB2 genes are located around cancer susceptibility loci or recombination hot spots in the human genome. STB1 is moderately expressed in K-562 (leukemia), G-361 (melanoma), and MKN7 (gastric cancer) cells. STB2 is highly expressed in MKN28, MKN74 (gastric cancer), BxPC-3, PSN-1, and Hs766T (pancreatic cancer) cells. On the other hand, STB1 and STB2 are significantly down-regulated in several cancer cell lines and primary tumors. Xenopus homologue of human STB1 and STB2 regulates negatively the WNT - beta-catenin signaling pathway. Loss-of-function mutations of genes encoding negative regulators of WNT - beta-catenin signaling pathway lead to carcinogenesis. Based on functional aspects and human chromosomal loci, STB1 gene and STB2 gene are predicted to be potent tumor suppressor gene candidates. STB1 and STB2 might be suitable targets for tissue engineering in the field of re-generative medicine and for chemoprevention and treatment in the field of clinical oncology.","['Katoh, Masaru']",['Katoh M'],"['Genetics and Cell Biology Section, Genetics Division, National Cancer Center Research Institute, Chuo-ku, Tokyo 104-0045, Japan. mkatoh@ncc.go.jp']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Greece,Int J Mol Med,International journal of molecular medicine,9810955,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (VANGL1 protein, human)', '0 (VANGL2 protein, human)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Carrier Proteins', 'Conserved Sequence', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Membrane Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Multigene Family', 'Neoplasms/genetics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Strabismus/*genetics']",2002/06/13 10:00,2002/12/04 04:00,['2002/06/13 10:00'],"['2002/06/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/04 04:00 [medline]', '2002/06/13 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Int J Mol Med. 2002 Jul;10(1):11-5.,,,,,,,62,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this paper, we examine part of the process of the emergence of biomedicine by focusing on the development of clinical cancer trials in the United States in the years 1955-66, a period during which the clinical trials program run by the National Cancer Institute became autonomous from the Institute's screening program for anticancer compounds.

The most common fusion partner is promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML), which is fused to RARalpha in the balanced reciprocal chromosomal translocation, t(15;17)(q22:q11). Expression of PML/RARalpha from the cathepsin G promoter in transgenic mice causes a nonfatal myeloproliferative syndrome in all mice; about 15% go on to develop APL after a long latent period, suggesting that additional mutations are required for the development of APL. A candidate target gene for a second mutation is FLT3, because it is mutated in approximately 40% of human APL cases. Activating mutations in FLT3, including internal tandem duplication (ITD) in the juxtamembrane domain, transform hematopoietic cell lines to factor independent growth. FLT3-ITDs also induce a myeloproliferative disease in a murine bone marrow transplant model, but are not sufficient to cause AML. Here, we test the hypothesis that PML/RARalpha can cooperate with FLT3-ITD to induce an APL-like disease in the mouse. Retroviral transduction of FLT3-ITD into bone marrow cells obtained from PML/RARalpha transgenic mice results in a short latency APL-like disease with complete penetrance. This disease resembles the APL-like disease that occurs with long latency in the PML/RARalpha transgenics, suggesting that activating mutations in FLT3 can functionally substitute for the additional mutations that occur during mouse APL progression. The leukemia is transplantable to secondary recipients and is ATRA responsive. These observations document cooperation between PML/RARalpha and FLT3-ITD in development of the murine APL phenotype.","['Kelly, Louise M', 'Kutok, Jeffrey L', 'Williams, Ifor R', 'Boulton, Christina L', 'Amaral, Sonia M', 'Curley, David P', 'Ley, Timothy J', 'Gilliland, D Gary']","['Kelly LM', 'Kutok JL', 'Williams IR', 'Boulton CL', 'Amaral SM', 'Curley DP', 'Ley TJ', 'Gilliland DG']","[""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.""]",['eng'],"['P01 CA066996/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 DK050654/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 66996/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK 50654/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (flt3 ligand protein)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 3.4.- (Cathepsins)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Serine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.21.20 (CTSG protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.21.20 (Cathepsin G)', 'EC 3.4.21.20 (Ctsg protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cathepsin G', 'Cathepsins/genetics', 'Crosses, Genetic', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Membrane Proteins/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Serine Endopeptidases', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",2002/06/13 10:00,2002/08/03 10:01,['2002/06/13 10:00'],"['2002/06/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/03 10:01 [medline]', '2002/06/13 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1073/pnas.122233699 [doi]', '99/12/8283 [pii]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2002 Jun 11;99(12):8283-8. doi: 10.1073/pnas.122233699.,,,PMC123059,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These tumor-associated, altered glycosphingolipids are often shed into the tumor cell microenvironment and mediate immunosuppressive activity. The nature and form of glycolipids shed by a variety of tumor cell lines and the mechanism(s) of shedding have been well characterized. The murine T cell lymphoma line, L5178Y-R, is known to shed a tumor-associated glycolipid, gangliotriaosylceramide, into the culture medium. We analyzed the effect of glycolipids from L5178Y-R on antigen presentation by murine CD1d1 molecules. CD1d1 molecules present glycolipid antigens to a specialized class of T cells called natural killer T (NKT) cells that mainly express a T cell receptor alpha chain (Valpha14Jalpha281) associated with Vbeta chains of limited diversity. In the current report, we found that L5178Y-R cells express CD1 on their cell surface yet are unable to stimulate CD1d1-specific NKT cells. We hypothesized that the glycolipid(s) shed by L5178Y-R inhibited antigen presentation by CD1d1. Pretreatment of CD1d1(+) cells with conditioned medium from L5178Y-R inhibited CD1-specific stimulation of canonical (Valpha14(+)) but not noncanonical (Valpha5(+)) NKT cells. Exogenous addition of lipids extracted from L5178Y-R cells as well as purified gangliotriaosylceramide mimicked this effect. Inhibition of glycolipid shedding in L5178Y-R cells with d-1-phenyl-2-hexadecanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol resulted in the rescue of CD1d1 recognition by canonical (but not noncanonical) NKT cells. These results suggest that one means by which certain tumor cells can evade the host's innate antitumor immune response is by shedding glycolipids that inhibit CD1-mediated antigen presentation to NKT cells.","['Sriram, Venkataraman', 'Cho, Sungyoo', 'Li, Ping', ""O'Donnell, Patrick W"", 'Dunn, Claire', 'Hayakawa, Kyoko', 'Blum, Janice S', 'Brutkiewicz, Randy R']","['Sriram V', 'Cho S', 'Li P', ""O'Donnell PW"", 'Dunn C', 'Hayakawa K', 'Blum JS', 'Brutkiewicz RR']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Indiana University School of Medicine, Building R4, Room 302, 1044 West Walnut Street, Indianapolis, IN 46202-5254.']",['eng'],['R01 AI049589/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Antigens, CD1)', '0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (Glycolipids)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD1/*immunology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Culture Media, Conditioned', 'Glycolipids/*metabolism', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'L Cells', 'Leukemia L5178/immunology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Transfection']",2002/06/13 10:00,2002/08/03 10:01,['2002/06/13 10:00'],"['2002/06/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/03 10:01 [medline]', '2002/06/13 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1073/pnas.122636199 [doi]', '99/12/8197 [pii]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2002 Jun 11;99(12):8197-202. doi: 10.1073/pnas.122636199.,,,PMC123044,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous reports pinpointed these residues as specificity determinants in the function of Hoxa1 when it is acting as a monomer. However, in vitro data supported that these residues do not influence the target specificity of Hoxa1 in Pbx1a-Hoxa1 heterodimers. Here, we have analysed the transcriptional activity of a Hoxa1(NA-KR) mutant for which the asparagine and alanine residues of the homeodomain have been replaced by lysine and arginine, respectively. Comparison between the wild-type and mutant Hoxa1 reveals that they show distinct activity on the TSEII enhancer of the somatostatin gene, but that they are equally active in the presence of Pbx and Prep cofactors. This therefore corroborates the biochemical evidence having shown that the second and third residues of the homeodomain do not contribute to the DNA binding of Hoxa1-Pbx dimers. However, on the hoxb1 autoregulatory enhancer, Hoxa1 and Hoxa1(NA-KR) may display distinct activity despite the presence of Pbx, in a cell-type dependent manner. Therefore, our data suggest that, depending on the enhancer, these residues may contribute to the functional specificity of Hoxa1 and that this contribution may not be abrogated by the interaction with Pbx.","['Remacle, Sophie', 'Shaw-Jackson, Chloe', 'Matis, Christelle', 'Lampe, Xavier', 'Picard, Jacques', 'Rezsohazy, Rene']","['Remacle S', 'Shaw-Jackson C', 'Matis C', 'Lampe X', 'Picard J', 'Rezsohazy R']","['Unite de Genetique du Developpement, UCL 7382, Universite Catholique de Louvain, B-1200 Bruxelles, Belgium.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Nucleic Acids Res,Nucleic acids research,0411011,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (HOXB1 homeodomain protein)', '0 (Herpes Simplex Virus Protein Vmw65)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (PKNOX1 protein, human)', '0 (Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (homeobox A1 protein)', '0 (pbx1 protein, human)', '51110-01-1 (Somatostatin)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Substitution', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', '*Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Herpes Simplex Virus Protein Vmw65/genetics', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Somatostatin/genetics', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Trans-Activators/*chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation']",2002/06/13 10:00,2002/06/29 10:01,['2002/06/13 10:00'],"['2002/06/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/06/29 10:01 [medline]', '2002/06/13 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/nar/gkf372 [doi]'],ppublish,Nucleic Acids Res. 2002 Jun 15;30(12):2663-8. doi: 10.1093/nar/gkf372.,,,PMC117285,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This substance promoted cell death via a mitochondrial signaling pathway, that is, by activation of Bid and Bax, loss of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential, release of cytochrome c, and activation of effector caspases, even under conditions of Bcl-2 overexpression. Furthermore, sensitivity to TC-A was not dependent on expression of wild-type caspase-8. In contrast, this apoptotic pathway was inhibited markedly by pretreatment of cells with cycloheximide, an inhibitor of de novo protein synthesis. cDNA microarray chip analysis revealed that TC-A induced a significant up-regulation of members of the heat shock protein family known to be involved in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-stress-induced apoptotic program. The activation of caspase-12, the central inducer caspase involved in ER-stress by TC-A treatment, is in concordance with this result. These results show that, in T-ALL cells, TC-A induces an apoptotic machinery via mitochondrial and ER signaling, which is not inhibited by aberrant expression/function of important regulators of death receptor- and drug-induced apoptosis.","['Tinhofer, Inge', 'Anether, Gabriele', 'Senfter, Monika', 'Pfaller, Kristian', 'Bernhard, David', 'Hara, Mitsunobu', 'Greil, Richard']","['Tinhofer I', 'Anether G', 'Senfter M', 'Pfaller K', 'Bernhard D', 'Hara M', 'Greil R']","['Laboratory of Molecular Cytology, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Innsbruck, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria.

Relationship with down-regulation of TNF receptors.,30622-8,"Bcr-Abl, the product of the protooncogene bcr-abl, is a constitutively active protein-tyrosine kinase that is highly expressed in chronic myelogenous leukemia and in acute myeloid leukemia cells. Because Bcr-Abl is known to provide mitogenic signals through suppression of apoptosis, we investigated the effect of this oncogene product on signaling by tumor necrosis factor (TNF), a proapoptotic cytokine. We used a bcr-abl-deficient human megakaryocytic leukemia cell line MO7E and an isogenic MBA cell line stably transfected with bcr-abl. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay revealed that TNF activated the nuclear transcription factor NF-kappaB in MO7E cells but not in MBA cells. The impaired NF-kappaB activation in Bcr-Abl-expressing cells was not due to absence of the NF-kappaB proteins p65, p50, or p100 or of IkappaBalpha or IkappaBbeta. Okadaic acid-induced NF-kappaB activation was unaffected by Bcr-Abl expression. TNF induced IkappaBalpha phosphorylation and degradation in MO7E cells but not in MBA cells. The suppression of TNF-induced NF-kappaB activation by Bcr-Abl was not restricted to MBA cells, because ectopic expression of Bcr-Abl in human acute myeloid leukemia HL-60 cells also blocked TNF-induced NF-kappaB activation. When examined for the TNF receptors by the radioreceptor assay, flow cytometry, or Western blot analysis, we found that Bcr-Abl expression down-regulated the expression of the TNF receptors. The RNase protection assay and Northern blot analysis revealed the transcriptional down-regulation of the TNF receptor by Bcr-Abl protein. Overall, these results indicate that ectopic expression of Bcr-Abl interferes with the TNF signaling pathway through the down-regulation of TNF receptors.","['Mukhopadhyay, Asok', 'Shishodia, Shishir', 'Suttles, Jill', 'Brittingham, Katherine', 'Lamothe, Betty', 'Nimmanapalli, Ramdevi', 'Bhalla, Kapil N', 'Aggarwal, Bharat B']","['Mukhopadhyay A', 'Shishodia S', 'Suttles J', 'Brittingham K', 'Lamothe B', 'Nimmanapalli R', 'Bhalla KN', 'Aggarwal BB']","['Cytokine Research Laboratory, Department of Bioimmunotherapy, University of Texas M.

To study the role of DNA methylation in relapse mechanisms in acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), we have compared the methylation status of five genes at the time of initial presentation and at first relapse in 25 adult patients with ALL. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Genes studied included the estrogen receptor (ER), multidrug resistance gene 1 (MDR1), p73, p15, and p16. DNA was extracted from paraffin-embedded bone marrow biopsies. DNA methylation was analyzed using PCR of bisulfite-modified DNA. RESULTS: Results indicate that methylation at the time of relapse was stable in 92% of patients for p73, 88% for ER, 80% for p16, 72% for MDR1, and 60% for p15. Only one case had p16 methylation at initial presentation, whereas 6 patients (P = 0.0001) had methylation at relapse. Three cases had concomitant methylation of p15 and p16 at relapse. The degree of MDR1 methylation inversely correlated with the presence of MDR1 expression as detected by immunohistochemistry. Eighteen patients (72%) had acquired no or one methylation change, whereas the rest (28%) had methylation changes in two or three genes. No clinical-biological correlations were found between methylation of any particular gene or pattern. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, DNA methylation patterns are stable in a majority of patients with relapsed ALL, but a subset of patients acquire new methylation changes, in particular affecting cell cycle regulatory genes.","['Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Bueso-Ramos, Carlos', 'Daniel, Jerry', 'Williamson, Jason', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M', 'Issa, Jean-Pierre J']","['Garcia-Manero G', 'Bueso-Ramos C', 'Daniel J', 'Williamson J', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Issa JP']","['Department of Leukemia, University of Texas M.

Although this finding is critical to leukemogenesis, its prognostic significance remains uncertain. To evaluate this, loss of DCC gene expression in AML patients and their prognostic significance were investigated. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: A group of 170 patients with AML was analyzed. DCC gene expression in AML cells was determined by a semiquantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR. Simultaneous mutation analyses of the p53, N-ras, and FLT3 genes were performed in all of the AML cells by single-strand conformation polymorphism and sequencing subsequent to PCR. The importance of loss of DCC expression was evaluated by Cox proportional analysis and the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: Loss of DCC expression was detected in 47 patients (27.6%). The p53, N-ras, and FLT3 mutations were detected in 20 (11.7%), 42 (24.7%), and 26 (15.2%) patients, respectively. The durations of overall survival (OS) and complete remission (CR) of the 47 DCC-negative AML patients were significantly shorter than that of the 123 DCC-positive patients (P < 0.0045 and <0.0060, respectively). Univariate and multivariate analyses showed that loss of DCC expression was an unfavorable prognostic factor for both OS (P < 0.0053 and <0.0084, respectively) and CR duration (P < 0.0146 and <0.0371, respectively). The 64 DCC-positive patients with wild p53, N-ras, and FLT3 had statistically better CR attainment compared with the other 106 patients (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Loss of DCC gene expression was shown to be an independent prognostic factor in AML patients. Thus, loss of DCC gene expression might serve as an important molecular marker for predicting the CR duration and OS of patients with AML.","['Inokuchi, Koiti', 'Yamaguchi, Hiroki', 'Hanawa, Hideki', 'Tanosaki, Sakae', 'Nakamura, Kayo', 'Tarusawa, Miki', 'Miyake, Koichi', 'Shimada, Takashi', 'Dan, Kazuo']","['Inokuchi K', 'Yamaguchi H', 'Hanawa H', 'Tanosaki S', 'Nakamura K', 'Tarusawa M', 'Miyake K', 'Shimada T', 'Dan K']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Nippon Medical School, 1-1-5 Sendagi, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8603, Japan. inokuchi@nms.ac.jp']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow/physiology', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Disease Progression', 'Down-Regulation', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes, DCC/*genetics', 'Genes, p53/genetics', 'Genes, ras/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'RNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Survival Rate', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3']",2002/06/13 10:00,2002/12/28 04:00,['2002/06/13 10:00'],"['2002/06/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/28 04:00 [medline]', '2002/06/13 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2002 Jun;8(6):1882-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) plays an important role in solid tumor growth, invasiveness, and angiogenesis, in part through the synthesis of prostaglandins such as prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)). In a prospective study, we evaluated COX-2 expression in snap-frozen, surgically resected MM tissue specimens using immunohistochemistry and semiquantitative Western blotting. PGE(2) was assessed by enzyme immunoassay. Thirty epithelioid, 10 biphasic, and 8 sarcomatoid tumors were evaluated. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated strong cytoplasmic tumor cell and variable stromal staining in all of the cases. COX-2 protein levels were correlated with clinicopathological prognostic factors using Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards models. High COX-2 band densitometry values correlated with poor survival (P = 0.008). In multivariate analysis, high COX-2 expression (P = 0.0005), nonepithelioid cell type (P = 0.002), and chest pain (P = 0.04) were independent predictors of poor prognosis. Furthermore, COX-2 expression contributed in multivariate analysis to both European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (P = 0.001) and Cancer and Leukemia Group B (P = 0.003) prognostic scoring systems. The presence of PGE(2) was demonstrated in all of the samples. These results suggest that COX-2 expression is a prognostic factor in MM. COX-2 is a potential therapeutic target in MM, and trials are required of COX-2 inhibitors alone or in combination with existing treatment modalities.","['Edwards, John G', 'Faux, Stephen P', 'Plummer, Simon M', 'Abrams, Keith R', 'Walker, Rosemary A', 'Waller, David A', ""O'Byrne, Kenneth J""]","['Edwards JG', 'Faux SP', 'Plummer SM', 'Abrams KR', 'Walker RA', 'Waller DA', ""O'Byrne KJ""]","['University Department of Oncology, Osborne Building, Royal Infirmary, University of Leicester, Leicester, LE1 5WW, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (Cyclooxygenase 2)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (PTGS2 protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthases)', 'K7Q1JQR04M (Dinoprostone)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/metabolism', 'Cyclooxygenase 2', 'Dinoprostone/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Mesothelioma/*enzymology/pathology/surgery', 'Peptide Fragments/immunology/pharmacology', 'Pleural Neoplasms/*enzymology/pathology/surgery', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthases/*metabolism', 'Survival Rate']",2002/06/13 10:00,2002/12/28 04:00,['2002/06/13 10:00'],"['2002/06/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/28 04:00 [medline]', '2002/06/13 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2002 Jun;8(6):1857-62.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Evidence indicates that GCs induce apoptosis in hematological cells, thus supporting their use as chemotherapeutic agents for leukemias, lymphomas, and myeloma. Although much research has been focused on investigating the mechanism of action responsible for GC-mediated cell death, the signaling pathways remain unclear. Two schools of thought have developed to account for GC-induced apoptosis. One supports the hypothesis that apoptosis is achieved via activation of death-inducing genes. The second theory states that GCs induce apoptosis via repression of transcription factor activity, thereby inhibiting the transcription of growth/survival genes. This review will attempt to clarify the complex signaling pathway responsible for mediating GC-induced apoptosis of hematological cells and to summarize the most current research in this field.","['Greenstein, Stephanie', 'Ghias, Kulsoom', 'Krett, Nancy L', 'Rosen, Steven T']","['Greenstein S', 'Ghias K', 'Krett NL', 'Rosen ST']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, Robert H.

Intracellular accumulation of DOX was analyzed by spectrofluorometry. P-glycoprotein (P-gp) activity was investigated by measuring the extrusion of the cationic dye rhodamine 123 (Rh123). The apoptosis of cells and mdr1 gene expression were detected using flow cytometry and RTPCR, respectively. RESULTS: PND slightly inhibited the growth of MDR human leukemia, breast cancer cells, and their parental cell lines. The IC50 of PND were 5.10 - 18.66 micromol/L depending on the kinds of cell lines. PND at low toxic concentrations enhanced antiproliferative effect of DOX on MDR cells and the apoptosis induced by DOX in a concentration-dependent manner.

The most frequent type, occurring after treatment with alkylating agents, is characterized by abnormalities of chromosomes 5 and/or 7 and t-MDS/AML following treatment with topoisomerase II inhibitors and is associated with molecular aberrations of MLL (11q23) and AML-1 (21q22). Individuals with certain polymorphisms associated with impaired detoxification of cytotoxic agents have an increased risk of developing MDS or AML after treatment of unrelated cancers. Multidrug chemotherapy is less effective for patients with MDS, or AML following MDS, or t-MDS/AML when compared with primary AML, and results in lower complete remission (CR) rates and lower long-term survival. Patients with good risk cytogenetic features, such as t(15; 17), t(8; 21) and inversion 16 are an exception as their treatment outcome is comparable with primary AML patients. Patients who attain a polyclonal and/or a cytogenetic CR may be candidates for autologous stem cell transplantation. For the remaining patients, the only curative option is allogeneic stem cell transplantation with stem cells from a histocompatible sibling or an alternative donor. Reduced intensity conditioning regimens may be considered for patients older than 50 years or patients with comorbidities.

At the laboratory level, molecular mechanisms underlying the arrest of differentiation that typically features in this malignancy, have been clarified and currently provide important models for addressing future investigation aimed at releasing the maturation block in other malignancies. In the clinic, advances in the management of APL have converted this rapidly fatal disease into the most frequently curable leukemia in adults. Use of retinoids in combinatorial protocols with anthracycline-based chemotherapy for front line treatment currently results in long-term survival and potential cure in at least 60% of newly diagnosed patients. Even after relapse, the disease is still curable in a high percentage of cases by various approaches including combinations of chemotherapy, retinoids, arsenic trioxide, stem cell transplantation and antibody-targeted chemotherapy. Genetic testing for identification of the disease-specific gene rearrangement and monitoring of residual disease have proved critical in establishing correct diagnosis and better evaluate the response to therapy at the molecular level. Current 'hot' issues for clinical investigation include: (i) better understanding and management of the severe coagulopathy present at diagnosis in most patients; (ii) the definition of risk categories to improve identification of patients at highest risk of relapse and (iii) the translation of successful differentiation therapy to other leukemia subsets.","['Mandelli, Franco', 'Avvisati, Giuseppe', 'Lo Coco, Francesco']","['Mandelli F', 'Avvisati G', 'Lo Coco F']","[""Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, University 'La Sapienza', Rome, Italy.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Italy,Rev Clin Exp Hematol,Reviews in clinical and experimental hematology,9815344,['5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)'],IM,"['Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Disease Management', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/etiology/*pathology', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tretinoin/therapeutic use']",2002/06/13 10:00,2002/08/02 10:01,['2002/06/13 10:00'],"['2002/06/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/02 10:01 [medline]', '2002/06/13 10:00 [entrez]']","['61 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1468-0734.2002.00061.x [doi]']",ppublish,Rev Clin Exp Hematol. 2002 Mar;6(1):60-71; discussion 86-7. doi: 10.1046/j.1468-0734.2002.00061.x.,,,,,,,85,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In agreement with the benefit seen by patients under age 60 from high-dose cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C), there are dose effects in the over 60s, in particular for daunorubicin, in induction treatment and for the duration of postremission treatment. The use of these effects can partly overcome the mostly unfavorable disease biology in older age AML, as expressed by the absence of favorable and the over-representation of adverse chromosomal abnormalities as well as the expression of drug resistance. We recommend an adequate dosage of 60 mg/m2 daunorubicin on 3 days in combination with standard dose Ara-C and 6-thioguanine given for induction and consolidation, and followed by a prolonged monthly maintenance chemotherapy for at least 1 year's duration. Further improvements in supportive care may help to deliver additional antileukemic cytotoxicity. As a novel approach, nonmyeloablative preparative regimens may open up the possibility of allogeneic transplantation for older patients with AML. Other new options like multidrug resistance modulators, antibody targeted therapies and molecular targeting are under clinical investigation. A questionnaire study in patients with AML showed that, according to patients' self-assessment, intensive and prolonged treatment did not result in a diminished quality of life.

Several regimens achieve broadly similar results. For patients who enter complete remission, the overall relapse risk is now 45-50%, but this is highly variable and is primarily determined by the biology of the disease. Cytogenetics are strongly influential in response to induction and consolidation with t(15:17), t(8:21) and inv(16) either occurring alone or with additional abnormalities having a relapse risk of about 30% and complex changes, abnormal 3q or abnormalities of chromosomes 5 and 7 resulting in a lower remission rate and a rapid relapse cumulating to 80%. FLT3 mutations occur in 25% of patients and are an independent predictor of relapse and, when combined with cytogenetics, adversely influence the prognosis in each cytogenetic risk group. Recent prospective collaborative group trials have endeavored to evaluate allogeneic and autologous bone marrow transplant against or in addition to consolidation chemotherapy. Suboptimal treatment delivery emerged as a problem. When the results were reported on an intention-to-treat basis, no overall survival advantage was consistently seen for either type of transplant. However, a significant reduction in risk of relapse was usually seen overall and within risk groups. Analysis within risk groups suggests that transplant is not indicated in good risk disease and continues to require evaluation in standard or poor risk patients. It is probable that traditional dose intensification has now reached its limits of tolerability, so new approaches will be required for further progress to be made.

A case-control study of childhood leukaemia diagnosed at ages 2-14 years has now been conducted in Hong Kong. Cases (n=98) formed a consecutive series of Chinese children diagnosed with acute leukaemia; controls (n=228) were identified following a survey using random digit dialling and required to attend for medical examination by a paediatrician. Interviews with mothers were conducted in hospital by one trained interviewer using a structured questionnaire. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) are reported for exposure variables capable of serving as proxies for exposure to infection in two critical time periods: first year of life, year before reference date (diagnosis for cases, corresponding date for controls). Analyses used logistic regression with adjustment for appropriate confounders. Change of area of residence reduced risk if during the first time period (OR = 0.47 [95% CI 0.23, 0.98]) and increased risk if during the second (OR=3.92, [95% CI 1.47, 10.46]). Reported roseola and/or fever and rash in the first year of life reduced risk (OR=0.33 [95% CI 0.16, 0.68]) whereas tonsillitis in the period 3-12 months before reference date increased risk (OR=2.56 [95% CI 1.22, 5.38]). Some other proxies for exposure to infection at the critical times were associated with predicted patterns of risk but day-care attendance failed to show predicted associations.

Conditioning for SCT consisted of cyclophosphamide and total body irradiation in 156 (91%) patients. Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis was with standard cyclosporine and methotrexate in 95 (55%) patients. Median post-transplant follow-up was 5.6 years (range, 0.2--16.7). Multivariate analysis of transplant-related mortality (TRM) identified four variables associated with a lower risk: disease status of first complete remission (CR) at SCT, patient age of 45 years and younger, transplant performed during or after 1995, and lack of acute GVHD.

In univariate analysis, patient age, cytogenetics, white blood cell count at presentation, CR1 duration and the sensitivity of clonogeneic leukaemia (CFU-L) in the graft to 4HC were all prognostic for EFS. Using each of these significant variables in multivariate modelling, patient age and sensitivity of CFU-L to 4HC were determined to be predictors of EFS. 4HC-purged autologous BMT produced results similar to allogeneic BMT for AML patients beyond first remission.","['Smith, B Douglas', 'Jones, Richard J', 'Lee, Shing M', 'Piantadosi, Steve', 'Vala, Milada S', 'Fuller, Don', 'Gore, Steven D', 'Noga, Steven J', ""O'Donnell, Paul V"", 'Braine, Hayden', 'Vogelsang, Georgia B', 'Fuchs, Ephraim J', 'Flinn, Ian W', 'Brodsky, Robert A', 'Ambinder, Richard F', 'Miller, Carole B']","['Smith BD', 'Jones RJ', 'Lee SM', 'Piantadosi S', 'Vala MS', 'Fuller D', 'Gore SD', 'Noga SJ', ""O'Donnell PV"", 'Braine H', 'Vogelsang GB', 'Fuchs EJ', 'Flinn IW', 'Brodsky RA', 'Ambinder RF', 'Miller CB']","['Johns Hopkins Oncology Center, Bunting-Blaustein Cancer Research Building, Rm 246, 1650 Orleans Street, Baltimore, MD 21231, USA. smithdo@jhmi.edu']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'U880A4FUDA (perfosfamide)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Bone Marrow Purging', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*methods', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Cyclophosphamide/*analogs & derivatives', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/immunology/mortality/*therapy', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neutrophils', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",2002/06/13 10:00,2002/09/11 10:01,['2002/06/13 10:00'],"['2002/06/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/11 10:01 [medline]', '2002/06/13 10:00 [entrez]']","['3530 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2002.03530.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2002 Jun;117(4):907-13. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2002.03530.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, CR is not a clear-cut phenomenon and certain variables of its definition could more accurately characterize the quality of the remission. Because platelet recovery > 100 x 10(9)/l is an essential component of CR in acute leukaemia, we hypothesized that time to platelet recovery (TPR) might be predictive of overall survival (OS) or disease-free survival (DFS) in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). We analysed TPR in 249 patients with ALL who entered CR after one course of induction chemotherapy and correlated TPR with DFS and OS. TPR was significantly associated with both DFS and OS if it occurred within a maximum of about 60 d from start of therapy. Furthermore, during that time period, the relative risk of death increased with increasing TPR. Although presence of the Philadelphia chromosome was the single most important adverse feature at diagnosis, the effect of TPR on survival continued to be significant within this patient subgroup. This effect was so pronounced that Philadelphia chromosome-positive patients with a TPR of 12 d had a better outcome than Philadelphia chromosome-negative patients with a TPR of 48 d. Thus, a short TPR seems to be able to override adverse characteristics in the outcome of ALL patients treated with chemotherapy. We conclude that a quicker TPR predicts longer DFS and OS in patients with ALL. As platelet counts are obtained almost daily in patients undergoing chemotherapy, TPR can readily be utilized to assess the prognosis of these patients.","['Faderl, Stefan', 'Thall, Peter F', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M', 'Estrov, Zeev']","['Faderl S', 'Thall PF', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Estrov Z']","['Department of Leukaemia, The University of Texas M.

These factors include reduced influx of ara-C by the hENT1 transporter, reduced phosphorylation by deoxycytidine kinase (dCK), and increased degradation by high Km cytoplasmic 5'-nucleotidase (5NT) and/or cytidine deaminase (CDD). Increased levels of DNA polymerase alpha (DNA POL) and reduced levels of topoisomerase I (TOPO I) and topoisomerase II (TOPO II) have also been detected in ara-C-resistant cell lines. To determine whether these factors are implicated in clinical ara-C resistance, we analysed the expression of these parameters at diagnosis, using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, in the blast cells of 123 AML patients treated with ara-C. At diagnosis, hENT1, dCK, CDD, 5NT, TOPO I, TOPO II, DNA POL and MDR1 were expressed in 83%, 22%, 7%, 37%, 59%, 37%, 39% and 16% of patients respectively. In univariate analysis, patients with expression of 5NT or DNA POL at diagnosis had significantly shorter disease-free survival (DFS). In multivariate analysis, DNA POL positivity and hENT1 deficiency were related to a shorter DFS. In univariate analysis, patients with 5NT-positive blasts had significantly shorter overall survival (OS). In multivariate analysis, shorter OS was related to DNA POL positivity.

Resveratrol displayed antiproliferative activity on both B-cell lines, as estimated by the decrease in cell recovery and inhibition of thymidine uptake. Furthermore, resveratrol induced apoptosis in the two cell lines as well as in B-CLL patients' cells, as evidenced by the increase in annexin V binding, caspase activation, DNA fragmentation and decrease of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential DeltaPsim. We previously reported that nitric oxide (NO), endogenously released by an iNO synthase (iNOS) spontaneously expressed in these leukaemic cells, contributed to their resistance towards apoptosis. We show here that resveratrol inhibited both iNOS protein expression and in situ NO release in WSU-CLL, ESKOL and B-CLL patients'cells. In addition, Bcl-2 expression was also inhibited by resveratrol. Thus, downregulation of the two anti-apoptotic proteins iNOS and Bcl-2 can contribute to the apoptotic effects of resveratrol in leukaemic B cells from chronic leukaemia.

In contrast, the biological significance of these molecules in human leukaemias is not clear. We determined the levels of MMP-2, MMP-9, TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 in the bone marrow of 37 patients with acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML) and 18 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) before chemotherapy. Nineteen bone marrow donors served as normal controls. After chemotherapy, sequential measurements were done during the course in 19 AML patients. The levels of TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 were significantly higher and MMP-9 levels were significantly lower in the AML and ALL patients than in the normal controls. MMP-2 levels were higher in ALL, but not AML patients, compared with controls. Moreover, the levels of marrow MMP-2 and MMP-9 did not parallel the numbers of leukaemic blasts in the peripheral blood. MMP-9 levels were significantly lower in the AML patients who achieved a complete remission (CR) than in those who did not (8.71 +/- 8.15 ng/ml vs 26.13 +/- 27.75 ng/ml, P < 0.05). The AML patients with lower MMP-9 levels (< or = 4.4 ng/ml) tended to have longer survival time than those with higher levels (> 12 months vs 4 months, P = 0.12). In addition, MMP-9 levels in the AML patients at CR rose to the same range as the controls, but dropped again at relapse, demonstrating a close relationship of marrow MMP-9 with disease status of AML. Therefore, we conclude that the level of marrow MMP-9 may be a useful surrogate marker for monitoring disease status in AML and propose it as a potential prognostic factor.","['Lin, Liang-In', 'Lin, Dong-Tsamn', 'Chang, Chi-Jen', 'Lee, Cheng-Yeh', 'Tang, Jih-Luh', 'Tien, Hwei-Fang']","['Lin LI', 'Lin DT', 'Chang CJ', 'Lee CY', 'Tang JL', 'Tien HF']","['School of Medical Technology, College of Medicine, University Hospital, National Taiwan University, #7 Chung-Shan S.

Here we have tested 25 patients with de novo acute leukaemias, while in remission at completion of their anti-leukaemia therapy, for evidence of autologous cytolytic immunity to their leukaemic cells taken and cryopreserved at disease presentation. We have measured this degree of cell-mediated cytotoxicity in vitro and termed it ""leukaemia cytolytic activity"" (LCA). Patients whose disease ultimately relapsed had significantly lower LCA than those who remained in remission beyond 2 years (P < 0.001); the absence of LCA when in remission predicted subsequent relapse within 2 years with a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 77%. LCA was mediated in vitro by CD56+/CD8alpha+/CD3- natural killer cells. We propose that it is this immune response, rather than the chemotherapy per se, which is responsible for continued remission and that measurement of LCA in patients at completion of therapy may be used as an indicator of risk of subsequent relapse. Patients lacking this response will require further treatment, either with an allogeneic donor transplant or an alternative immunotherapeutic strategy.","['Lowdell, Mark W', 'Craston, Rose', 'Samuel, David', 'Wood, Marion E', ""O'Neill, Elena"", 'Saha, Vaskar', 'Prentice, H Grant']","['Lowdell MW', 'Craston R', 'Samuel D', 'Wood ME', ""O'Neill E"", 'Saha V', 'Prentice HG']","['Department of Haematology, Royal Free Campus, Royal Free and University College Medical School, London NW3 2PF, UK. m.lowdell@rfc.ucl.ac.uk']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,['0 (CD56 Antigen)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'CD56 Antigen/immunology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Child', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/immunology', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/immunology', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/immunology', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2002/06/13 10:00,2002/09/11 10:01,['2002/06/13 10:00'],"['2002/06/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/11 10:01 [medline]', '2002/06/13 10:00 [entrez]']","['3495 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2002.03495.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2002 Jun;117(4):821-7. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2002.03495.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we present the first long-term endoscopic follow-up of a patient with Crohn disease undergoing autologous stem cell transplantation for haematological disease. A 54-year-old woman developed Crohn disease and was submitted to ileocaecal resection. Four months after surgery, the patient contracted acute myeloid leukaemia. She was initially treated with chemotherapy, and subsequently underwent autologous stem cell transplantation. Following transplantation, the patient has remained in clinical remission regarding both diseases, without anti-inflammatory medication. She has undergone ileo-colonoscopy with normal findings at 1, 2, 3 and 5 years after transplantation.

The aim of the present investigation was to characterize the anti-arthritic activity of T-614 in terms of regulation of the nuclear transcription factor NF-kappaB, which is associated with expression of many immune and inflammatory genes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: THP-1 cells (human monocytic leukemia cell line) were used throughout this in vitro study, and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha were employed for activation of the cells. Cytokine production was assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The mRNA levels were determined by a semi-quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. Assessment of the NF-kappaB DNA binding activity was performed by an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) using a digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide containing kappaB-binding site. Degradation kinetics of the cytosolic NF-kappaB inhibitor a (IkappaBalpha) were studied by Western blot analysis. RESULTS: T-614 inhibited LPS-stimulated production of TNF-alpha, interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-8 in a concentration-dependent manner with decreasing mRNA levels (IL-6 and IL-8). EMSA study showed that T-614 prevented TNF-alpha as well as LPS-stimulated activation of NF-kappaB, and Western blot analysis proved that T-614 did not affect degradation of IkappaBalpha protein. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the inhibitory effect of T-614 on the production of TNF-alpha, IL-6 and IL-8 in LPS-stimulated THP-1 cells may involve transcriptional regulation through suppression of NF-kappaB activation without interfering with IkappaBalpha degradation.","['Aikawa, Y', 'Yamamoto, M', 'Yamamoto, T', 'Morimoto, K', 'Tanaka, K']","['Aikawa Y', 'Yamamoto M', 'Yamamoto T', 'Morimoto K', 'Tanaka K']","['Research Laboratories, Toyama Chemical Co., Ltd., Japan. yukihiko_aikawa@toyama-chemical.co.jp']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Inflamm Res,Inflammation research : official journal of the European Histamine Research Society ...

MATERIALS AND METHODS: TNF-alpha and beta-hexosaminidase secretion were measured from rat basophilic leukemia cells (RBL-2H3) activated via the high affinity IgE receptor with dinitrophenyl-albumin (DNP-A) challenge in the presence of nicorandil. Inhibitors of K+ openers and NO were pre-incubated with the RBL-2H3 cells to determine the principal mode of action. RESULTS: Nicorandil significantly inhibited the release of TNF-alpha in a dose-dependent manner (p < 0.001, ANOVA) reaching a maximum inhibition of DNP-A 74.1% at 10(-3) M, (p < 0.001). Similarly it inhibited beta-hexosaminidase release (p < 0.001, ANOVA) with maximal inhibition at 10(-3) M (p < 0.001). Other K+ openers did not show this effect. Neither the potassium channel blocker glibenclamide nor the guanylyl cyclase inhibitor, ODQ, could reverse this inhibition, but when added in combination reduced the effect by 47%. CONCLUSIONS: Nicorandil is able to inhibit degranulation and TNF-alpha release of RBL cells stimulated through the IgE receptor, and requires both the K+ opening and nitric oxide donor activity, which may represent a novel method for inhibiting cytokine release.","['Heywood, G J', 'Thomas, P S']","['Heywood GJ', 'Thomas PS']","['Inflammation Research Unit, School of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW, Australia.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Inflamm Res,Inflammation research : official journal of the European Histamine Research Society ...

According to the common-variant/common-disease hypothesis, frequent functional polymorphisms are the best candidates for disease-susceptibility alleles. Implicitly, we also assume that disease-susceptibility alleles are preferentially transmitted from parents to the affected offspring and that this effect can be captured by the transmission/disequilibrium test (TDT). However, our study of genetic predisposition to childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia suggests that a focus on the patient's genotype might, in certain instances, be misleading. Our results indicate that, at least at some loci, parental genetics might be of primary importance in predicting the risk of cancer in this pediatric model of a complex disease. Consequently, in addition to TDT, other complementary strategies will need to be simultaneously applied to dissect genetic predisposition to complex disorders.","['Labuda, Damian', 'Krajinovic, Maja', 'Sabbagh, Audrey', 'Infante-Rivard, Claire', 'Sinnett, Daniel']","['Labuda D', 'Krajinovic M', 'Sabbagh A', 'Infante-Rivard C', 'Sinnett D']","['Centre de recherche, Hopital Sainte Justine, Universite de Montreal, Quebec, H3T 1C5 Canada. damian.labuda@umontreal.ca']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Hum Genet,American journal of human genetics,0370475,"['0 (Isoenzymes)', 'EC 1.14.13.- (Cytochrome P-450 CYP2E1)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (GSTP1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione S-Transferase pi)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)']",IM,"['Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2E1/genetics', 'Female', 'Genotype', 'Glutathione S-Transferase pi', 'Glutathione Transferase/genetics', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/genetics', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Male', 'Models, Genetic', 'Parents', 'Pedigree', 'Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/enzymology/*genetics', 'Risk Factors']",2002/06/12 10:00,2002/07/27 10:01,['2002/06/12 10:00'],"['2002/03/01 00:00 [received]', '2002/04/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/06/12 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/07/27 10:01 [medline]', '2002/06/12 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0002-9297(07)60050-0 [pii]', '10.1086/341345 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Hum Genet. 2002 Jul;71(1):193-7. doi: 10.1086/341345.

GVHD prophylaxis comprised cyclosporine alone or cyclosporine-methotrexate. Twenty-two patients relapsed at 3-46 months (median 7): 18 of 76 patients with ABO-matched donors and four of 43 patients with ABO-mismatched donors (actuarial 5-year probabilities 33 +/- 6% vs 12 +/- 6%; P = 0.028). The incidence of acute and chronic GVHD was not affected by ABO mismatch. The following factors were studied in Cox analysis for effect on outcome: gender, age, FAB subtype, ABO mismatch, CR-transplant interval, conditioning, TBI dose, nucleated cell dose, lymphocyte recovery, acute GVHD, and chronic GVHD. Donor-recipient ABO match was the only factor independently associated with a higher risk of relapse (RR = 3.7; 95% Cl, 1.1-12.6; P = 0.04). ABO mismatch was also associated with superior overall and disease-free survivals. We conclude that ABO incompatibility may influence relapse rates and survival favorably after allogeneic BMT.

The relative effectiveness of these strategies is still debated. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of trials to determine the effectiveness of BMT and ABMT in CR1 in paediatric AML. Eligible studies enrolled patients <21 years from 1985 to 2000 with AML in CR1. Two groups of studies were identified: (1) Those comparing the outcome of patients with and without a histocompatible family donor; and (2) Randomised controlled trials (RCT) comparing ABMT with non-myeloablative chemotherapy. The relative risk statistic was calculated for outcomes of interest in each trial. If there was no excessive heterogeneity between trials the results were pooled, and an overall relative risk and risk difference for treatment effect across trials were calculated. Results of the analysis showed that allocation to BMT reduced risk of relapse and improved disease-free and overall survival. For ABMT, heterogeneity of effect between RCTs prevented pooling of results. In conclusion, BMT from a histocompatible family donor improves patient outcome. Data are insufficient to determine whether this is true for all subgroups of AML, and whether ABMT is superior to non-myeloablative chemotherapy. An individual patient data meta-analysis is required to further evaluate the available data.","['Bleakley, M', 'Lau, L', 'Shaw, P J', 'Kaufman, A']","['Bleakley M', 'Lau L', 'Shaw PJ', 'Kaufman A']","[""Oncology Unit, The Children's Hospital at Westmead, Sydney, NSW, Australia.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Systematic Review']",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*therapy', 'Risk Factors', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",2002/06/12 10:00,2002/12/05 04:00,['2002/06/12 10:00'],"['2001/05/21 00:00 [received]', '2002/01/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/06/12 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/05 04:00 [medline]', '2002/06/12 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.bmt.1703528 [doi]'],ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2002 May;29(10):843-52. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1703528.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Peripheral blood stem cells were collected following mobilization with chemotherapy, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), or chemotherapy plus G-CSF. The conditioning regimen used consisted of either chemotherapy alone (112 cases) or chemotherapy plus total body irradiation (19 cases). The median number of colony-forming units granulocyte-macrophage (CFU-GM) was similar in both groups of patients, with the median number of CD34(+) cells infused being higher in the AML group (5.4 vs 4 x 10(6)/kg; P = 0.03). Median time neutrophils >0.5 x 10(9)/l was 13 days in both groups, and median time to a platelet count >20 x 10(9)/l was longer in AML patients (14 vs 12 days; P = 0.01). In multivariate analysis, the only factors affecting neutrophil recovery in the NMM group were the CD34+ cell number (continuous model) and the CFU-GM dose (categorized model) infused, whereas for platelet recovery, previous chemotherapy also remained significant. In the AML group, the only factors significantly affecting the speed of neutrophil recovery were dose of CD34+ cells administered and the patient's age. As for platelet recovery, only the progenitor dose administered remained significant. In the NMM group, the most discriminating cut-off values for a rapid neutrophil and platelet recovery were 1.5 x 10(6) and 2.5 x 10(6) CD34+ cells/kg, respectively, and for AML patients these figures were 1.5 x 10(6) and 4 x 10(6) CD34+ cells/kg, respectively.

We aimed to identify prognostic factors that might help in planning future therapy, and to assess the effectiveness of haemopoietic stem-cell transplantation in patients with the t(4;11) translocation, which is associated with a particularly poor outcome. METHODS: We reviewed data on 497 children and young adults who had ALL with various 11q23 abnormalities, including the translocations t(4;11), t(9;11), and t(11;19). All patients were treated with intensive chemotherapy, with or without haemopoietic stem-cell transplantation in first complete remission, by 11 study groups and single institutions from 1983 to 1995. FINDINGS: Age was the most important prognostic factor. In a Cox's proportional-hazard model stratified by 11q23 abnormalities, infants younger than 1 year fared significantly worse than patients 1 year of age or older (hazard ratio for event-free survival 1 84 [95% CI 1 38-2 47], p=0 0001). Among infants, any category of 11q23 abnormality conferred a dismal outcome, whereas in older patients, t(4;11) and t(9;11) were associated with a worse outcome than were other 11q23 changes. In the largest subgroup--256 patients with t(4;11)--any type of transplantation was associated with significantly worse disease-free survival (1 61 [1 10-2 35], p=0 014) and overall survival (1 76 [1 08-2 45], p=0 004) compared with chemotherapy only. Even transplantation with stem cells from HLA-matched related or HLA-matched unrelated donors tended to be associated with a worse outcome than chemotherapy alone. INTERPRETATION: The prognosis of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia with an 11q23 abnormality is particularly dismal in infants. Allogeneic transplantation with haemopoietic stem cells from an HLA-matched related donor does not seem to improve the clinical outcome in patients with t(4;11)-positive leukaemia.","['Pui, Ching-Hon', 'Gaynon, Paul S', 'Boyett, James M', 'Chessells, Judith M', 'Baruchel, Andre', 'Kamps, Willem', 'Silverman, Lewis B', 'Biondi, Andrea', 'Harms, Dorthe O', 'Vilmer, Etienne', 'Schrappe, Martin', 'Camitta, Bruce']","['Pui CH', 'Gaynon PS', 'Boyett JM', 'Chessells JM', 'Baruchel A', 'Kamps W', 'Silverman LB', 'Biondi A', 'Harms DO', 'Vilmer E', 'Schrappe M', 'Camitta B']","[""St Jude Children's Research Hospital and the University of Tennessee, College of Medicine, Memphis, TN 38105, USA. ching-hon.pui@stjude.org""]",['eng'],"['CA 31566/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA29139/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA37379/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA51001/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA78224/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Lancet,"Lancet (London, England)",2985213R,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Age Distribution', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Chi-Square Distribution', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11/*genetics', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Treatment Outcome']",2002/06/12 10:00,2002/06/20 10:01,['2002/06/12 10:00'],"['2002/06/12 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/06/20 10:01 [medline]', '2002/06/12 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0140-6736(02)08782-2 [pii]', '10.1016/S0140-6736(02)08782-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Lancet. 2002 Jun 1;359(9321):1909-15. doi: 10.1016/S0140-6736(02)08782-2.,,,,['Lancet. 2002 Jun 1;359(9321):1873-4.

For patients with stage IIIB (pleural effusion) and stage IV disease who have a Cancer and Leukemia Group B performance status (PS) of 0 to 1, appropriate management consists of combination chemotherapy with a platinum (either cisplatin or carboplatin) combined with paclitaxel, gemcitabine, vinorelbine, docetaxel, or CPT-11. Dosages and schedules previously established by large phase II or phase III studies should be followed. Variations in the toxicity patterns, schedules of administration, and economic considerations should guide the selection of the specific regimen. For patients who maintain a good performance status after first-line chemotherapy, second-line treatment may be considered. Current evidence supports the use of docetaxel as second-line treatment if the patient has not previously received this drug. Gemcitabine and paclitaxel may also have activity in this setting. Vinorelbine, ifosfamide, and CPT-11 appear to be inactive as second-line therapy for patients who have previously received platinum-based chemotherapy. For patients with a PS of 2, single-agent chemotherapy with vinorelbine, gemcitabine, or a combination of the two should be considered. Patients with poor performance status should be treated with supportive measures designed to relieve pain and acute complications because any tumor-directed therapy has limited benefit. Special situations exist in which curative therapy for metastatic disease is a possibility. Patients who present with solitary sites of metastatic disease, particularly after a long disease-free interval and in the CNS may undergo definitive surgery or radiotherapy with curative intent. Some have also reported favorable outcomes for patients with solitary adrenal or bone metastases as well. Surgical treatment or definitive radiotherapy should not be employed unless a thorough restaging evaluation is performed that includes computed tomography scan of the chest and abdomen through adrenals, brain magnetic resonance imaging, and positron emission tomography scan. A plethora of new agents targeting angiogenesis, tumor invasiveness, the hypoxic environment of tumors, and the cell cycle are currently in development.","['Edelman, M J', 'Khanwani, S L']","['Edelman MJ', 'Khanwani SL']","['University of Maryland Greenebaum Cancer Center, 22 S.

The molecular abnormality responsible for this disease--BCR-ABL--and the critical biochemical aberrations resulting from it have been studied in depth. These discoveries have led to the development of a molecule, STI571, that specifically inhibits the abnormal kinase enzymatic activity exhibited by BCR-ABL. Early results of clinical trials using STI571 have shown responses even in blast crisis. There has also been striking hematologic and cytogenetic remission rates in patients with advanced chronic phase disease, with very little toxicity. It is our opinion that this molecule will revolutionize the treatment of CML. Furthermore, the path leading to its discovery will become a paradigm for cancer therapeutics. At the time of this writing, STI571 remains investigational (although it is widely believed that it will be approved for clinical use in the United States this year ). Although suggested therapy for a disease does not generally incorporate medications that are still investigational, in this case, the impact of a still investigational agent cannot be ignored. The current data suggest that STI571 will be the treatment of choice for patients with advanced or resistant chronic phase. To date, STI571 has not been studied adequately in untreated CML patients. Even so, it is our feeling that, based on its compelling success in patients with interferon-refractory and advanced disease and on its benign side effect profile, it will quickly become the front-line therapy for CML once it becomes available. Despite the ease of administration of STI571, patients should continue to be encouraged to participate in clinical studies so that several vital issues can be resolved: 1) the percentage of untreated CML patients who will eventually develop molecular remissions; 2) the proportion of patients in whom resistance to STI571 will emerge; 3) the optimum length of treatment; and 4) the impact on survival. Because interferon-alfa can also result in cytogenetic remissions, albeit in a small percent (less than 20%) of early chronic phase patients, it seems reasonable to suggest that patients who do not attain cytogenetic/molecular remissions with STI571 alone be treated with a combination of STI571 and interferon-alfa. Patients who are resistant to STI571 with or without interferon-alfa should undergo allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant. Salvage therapy after transplant may include donor lymphocyte infusions, interferon-alfa, additional transplant, and perhaps STI571. Medications such as hydroxyurea appear destined to play a very limited role in CML. They may be used in the palliative treatment of older STI571-resistant patients or those without a transplant donor, although these patients may be best served by being considered for clinical trials of molecules, such as polyethylene glycol-interferon-alfa, on other novel agents.","['Kurzrock, R', 'Kantarjian, H', 'Talpaz, M']","['Kurzrock R', 'Kantarjian H', 'Talpaz M']","['Department of Bioimmunotherapy, Box 422, MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Boulevard, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Curr Treat Options Oncol,Current treatment options in oncology,100900946,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*therapy', 'Piperazines/therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use']",2002/06/12 10:00,2002/07/09 10:01,['2002/06/12 10:00'],"['2002/06/12 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/07/09 10:01 [medline]', '2002/06/12 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s11864-001-0038-0 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Treat Options Oncol. 2001 Jun;2(3):245-52. doi: 10.1007/s11864-001-0038-0.,,,,,,,20,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As more patients with these diseases live longer and lead productive lives upon successful initial treatment, strategies for preventing infections have become more important. Distinguishing patients at low risk for infection from those at high risk is a crucial but challenging issue. Unfortunately, there are hardly any data on the use of prophylactic antibiotics for patients with chronic lymphoid malignancy (CLL). If patients cannot be enrolled in a clinical trial, antibiotics with co-trimoxazole should be administered when steroids are warranted. They should also be administered in patients who have had a documented infection early in the treatment course and during neutropenia. Viral infections remain another controversial issue in patients with CLL receiving treatment, especially a purine analogue. Very low CD4 counts (less than 50 cells/mL) might predict for reactivation for herpes zoster. Outside of depleted CD4 counts, there are no other means of identifying a high-risk group. Based on limited data, it would be reasonable to administer herpes zoster prophylaxis to patients with CD4 counts that are severely depleted or to patients with a prior episode of zoster. Controversial issues still remain regarding immunoglobulin treatment, specifically cost, scarcity of the product, and adequate dose, which has not yet been established. We would consider intravenous immunoglobulin (Ig) replacement in patients with marked hypogammaglobulinemia (IgG less than 400 mg/dL) with more than two recent severe infections [1].

Of these disorders, mycosis fungoides is the most common; it follows an indolent, though gradually progressive, course that spans years. The T-cell prolymphocytic leukemias, in contrast, are generally refractory to treatment, with a median survival of typically less than 1 year. Although effective therapy remains elusive in most cases, the development of nucleosides as a class of chemotherapeutic agents and biologics, including interferon, monoclonal antibodies, and vitamin A derivatives, offers new hope for at least more effective palliation of these progressive lymphoproliferative disorders.

Relapses continue to occur over time, but most patients respond well to retreatment with the same agent. The longest follow-up is for patients treated with dCF, where the 5- and 10-year relapse-free survival rates are 80% to 85% and 67% to 76%, respectively. dCF is usually administered as 4 mg/m2 intravenously every second week until CR followed by two additional treatments for consolidation. CdA is administered as 0.09 mg/kg/d x 7, by continuous intravenous infusion, although it may be equally effective when given as daily boluses or subcutaneously. More recent studies have suggested that CdA, 0.15 mg/kg intravenously weekly x 6, produces equivalent response rates, while reducing the risk of febrile neutropenia (which occurs in approximately 50% of patients using the standard regimen). We have found this to be a very simple, safe, and effective regimen. Both dCF and CdA should be used with caution in the presence of renal or hepatic dysfunction, and both are contraindicated in the presence of active infection. Interferon-alfa (3 x 10(6) U subcutaneously three times per week for 12 months) produces inferior response rates but is less likely to cause febrile neutropenia.

Although vincristine/doxorubicin/dexamethasone (VAD) produces responses in approximately 50% to 70% of patients with previously untreated multiple myeloma, use early in the disease has not improved survival. Outside of a specific study protocol, this regimen may be best reserved for patients with refractory (particularly relapsing) disease. Notable exceptions include patients with renal failure or plasma cell leukemia in whom the rapid responses provided by VAD may avoid potentially permanent, serious complications. Recently, new agents with novel mechanisms of action (ie, thalidomide, immunomodulatory drugs, proteosome inhibitors) have demonstrated activity in resistant myeloma. Because these agents are likely to show activity alone or in combination, newly diagnosed patients and previously untreated patients should be considered for clinical trials. Thalidomide/dexamethasone has already produced response rates of 65% to 75% in previously untreated patients.

These improvements in response and delays in disease progression have not translated into a survival benefit, indicating that chlorambucil may be the preferred first-line therapy when treatment is indicated. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, by combining the cytoreductive effects of conditioning with a potent graft-versus-tumor effect, is the only treatment modality with the prospect of cure for patients with CLL. However, conventional hematopoietic stem cell transplantation can be offered only to select patients with CLL because of older age and comorbid conditions. Novel methods of transplantation exploiting the graft-versus-leukemia effect while reducing the toxicity of the pretransplant conditioning are promising approaches that may enable more patients to benefit from this therapy.

Current approaches include using standard acute myeloid leukemia (AML) regimens in an effort to induce remission, variations of these approaches with drugs that seem more active in this specific leukemia, and the direct entry of patients into studies of investigational agents. Although the likelihood of achieving remission is small, immediate bone marrow transplantation in remission should be considered because it provides the only opportunity for long-term survival at this time. Allogeneic transplantation is preferred, but autologous transplantation of an early chronic phase marrow may provide benefit. Often, however, the duration of chemotherapy-induced remission of blast crisis is very short and may preclude entry into a transplant program. In addition, the patient may not be a candidate due to donor issues, age, or medical problems. If transplant is not an option, maintenance interferon is often used, although its benefit is uncertain. For patients in the accelerated phase of the disease, which is characterized by a variety of clinical presentations and cytogenetic abnormalities, the possibility of favorably manipulating the disease is greater. Again, there is no standard treatment, and clinical trials are recommended as first-line therapy. Treatment in the accelerated phase includes standard AML chemotherapy regimens, combinations of new agents, and the combination of cytostatic agents with interferon. Patients whose accelerated phase reverts to chronic phase after treatment may become candidates for bone marrow transplantation. However, current new approaches to the chronic phase applied in accelerated phase as well as new approaches directed specifically toward accelerated phase may lead to prolonged stabilization without bone marrow transplantation.

All trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) is an essential component of the standard remission induction for all newly diagnosed APL patients. Remission induction with ATRA and chemotherapy given concurrently appears to be associated with fewer relapses. With further consolidation chemotherapy without high-dose cytosine arabinoside, the disease-free survival rate can reach 70% to 80%, and many of these patients are cured, more so than in any other AML subtype. APL is especially sensitive to anthracyclines, which should be included in the chemotherapy cycles at a higher dose than in other AML subtypes. Maintenance with low-dose chemotherapy (oral daily 6-mercaptopurine with weekly methotrexate) or ATRA further improves the long-term outcome. New approaches are also available for relapsing patients, although the optimal treatment is unknown. Patients who did not receive oral ATRA in first relapse can be treated with this agent, as can first relapsing patients who have been off the drug for more than 1 year. Because of poor remission rates, ATRA should not be used in patients with second or subsequent relapses (whether ATRA was given in the past), in patients with relapses early after ATRA discontinuation, or in patients relapsing while on ATRA therapy. Arsenic trioxide can also be used, especially in patients resistant to ATRA. Because arsenic trioxide is still experimental and not yet widely available, patients who are unlikely to respond to ATRA or who unsuccessfully undergo ATRA reinduction should be treated with chemotherapy. Patients in second or subsequent remission induced with ATRA or chemotherapy should receive consolidation chemotherapy. When arsenic trioxide is used for reinduction, the drug should be continued for several cycles; however, adding consolidation chemotherapy might improve the results. Because it is unknown whether APL in second or subsequent remission is curable with salvage therapy, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is often considered for patients with a human leukocyte antigen (HL-A)-identical sibling and autologous transplantation when a donor does not exist. However, compared with the new treatments, the role of transplantation for relapse is unclear. In first remission, there is no role for transplantation. A new liposomal formulation of intravenous ATRA is being investigated and seems effective in late first relapses, and it may be able to induce and maintain first remissions in selected patients without chemotherapy.","['Douer, D']",['Douer D'],"['Division of Hematology, Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Southern California, 1441 Eastlake Ave, Los Angeles, CA 90033, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Curr Treat Options Oncol,Current treatment options in oncology,100900946,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/pathology/*therapy', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tretinoin/therapeutic use']",2002/06/12 10:00,2002/07/26 10:01,['2002/06/12 10:00'],"['2002/06/12 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/07/26 10:01 [medline]', '2002/06/12 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s11864-000-0013-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Treat Options Oncol. 2000 Apr;1(1):31-40. doi: 10.1007/s11864-000-0013-1.,,,,,,,34,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, older age and other adverse risk factors seen more commonly in adults than in children have lessened the success of the treatment of ALL in comparison with what has been achieved in children. The treatment of ALL depends on the use of intensive multi-agent chemotherapy given over 6 to 9 months in combination with central nervous system prophylactic therapy with cranial radiation and intrathecal chemotherapy followed by maintenance chemotherapy for 2 to 3 years. This therapy has allowed younger patients with newly diagnosed ALL to achieve complete remission in 80% to 90% of cases, but has still resulted in subsequent relapse in most patients.

Additional agents or substitution of high-dose cytarabine for conventional-dose cytarabine during induction does not improve the remission rate or overall survival. There is substantial toxicity with high-dose cytarabine during induction. Thus, induction therapy for newly diagnosed patients with AML should consist of cytarabine (100 mg/m(2) as a continuous intravenous infusion over 24 hours for 7 days) and daunorubicin, idarubicin, or mitoxantrone. Meta-analysis demonstrates a modest benefit for idarubicin. Most patients who achieve a remission should receive further therapy with two to four cycles of high-dose cytarabine. Allogeneic stem cell transplant is reserved for patients with poor risk features. There is no role for autologous stem cell transplant in first remission outside a clinical trial. The majority of adults relapse. Salvage therapy usually consists of high-dose cytarabine. Allogeneic or autologous stem cell transplantation is preferred in second or subsequent remission.

These patients are classified as having smoldering, asymptomatic stage 1, or indolent multiple myeloma in order of their increasing risk of progression. We avoid chemotherapy, especially with alkylating agents in such patients, and we either closely monitor them or use a nonchemotherapeutic intervention. If significant bone lesions, renal failure, or hypercalcemia occur, chemotherapy or transplant is recommended. Patients with mild anemia or with small or isolated bone lesions who are asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic because of anemia may be monitored and are classified as having indolent multiple myeloma. Unnecessary treatment with melphalan or cyclophosphamide probably has no benefit in multiple myeloma NRC and can cause significant risk. In long-term follow up, 25% of patients receiving alkylating agents develop myelodysplastic syndrome or acute leukemia. Patients who do not receive chemotherapy must be monitored closely to avoid complications of overt multiple myeloma, including anemia, bone lesions, renal failure, and hypercalcemia. We and others have begun to take a more active approach with the use of nonchemotherapeutic agents in selected patients. We use bisphosphonates in patients with bone lesions or osteoporosis or when there is a progressive rise in M-protein. We use dexamethasone alone in NRC multiple myeloma to reduce tumor burden in selected patients who do not yet have overt multiple myeloma or who are not candidates for chemotherapy. We use bisphosphonates to prevent osteoporosis in such patients. We use erythropoietin to correct anemia, and dexamethasone and erythropoietin together in patients with higher tumor burden (eg, indolent multiple myeloma). Future progress in treating multiple myeloma NRC depends on better identification of new therapeutic targets that control progression from the stable asymptomatic to the progressive symptomatic phase of multiple myeloma. We need to better understand the biologic target of new agents like thalidomide to design more effective treatment for this early phase of multiple myeloma. Although these approaches may delay chemotherapy, it is not known whether survival is prolonged.

The most powerful effect of the maturation factor may be exerted throughout the mitotic duplication process of the most immature fibro-blastocysts in an in vitro cell culture. Thus, to achieve leukemia eradication, this specific cell culture, which might indefinitely be duplicating the immature fibro-blastocysts in the lineage of leukemic leukocytes, should be investigated and developed.

Haemorrhage, ischaemia, and occasional foci of vascular proliferation were found in tissue sections from affected dogs. Vessels, predominantly veins, throughout the body were frequently filled with neoplastic lymphocytes. Splenic involvement occurred in only one of 10 cases examined and bone marrow involvement was absent in four cases examined. Formalin-fixed paraffin wax-embedded tissues from 15 cases were examined immunohistochemically with streptavidin-biotin-horseradish peroxidase and a catalysed signal amplification system.

The clinical and pathological features of canine IVL closely resembled those of the human disease. In striking contrast to human cases, which are most often B-cell lymphomas, the immunophenotypes of the canine IVLs in this series were heterogeneous.

Currently, the signaling mechanisms in which these growth factors/cytokines activate satellite cell proliferation are not completely understood. Here, we sought to determine signaling mechanisms by which leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) induces satellite cell proliferation in culture. First, we confirmed that LIF induces proliferation of C2C12 immortalized myoblasts and cultured primary rat satellite cells. In addition, we also found that this increase in proliferation can be inhibited by incubation of the cells in tyrphostin AG 490, a specific inhibitor of Janus-activated kinase (JAK) 2 activity. Furthermore, we also found that incubation of the cells at various time points with LIF (10 ng/ml) induces a significant, transient increase in JAK2 phosphorylation, signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT3) phosphorylation, and STAT3 transcriptional activity. Increases in the STAT3-sensitive endogenous SOC3 protein followed these transient increases in STAT3 activation. In addition, AG 490 inhibited the increase in STAT3 phosphorylation. Finally, LIF did not change the phosphorylation status of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK)1/2 or affect the phosphorylation status of Akt/protein kinase B. However, LY-294002, an inhibitor of phosphoinositide 3-kinase, blocked LIF-induced proliferation of satellite cells. These data suggest that LIF induces satellite cell proliferation by activation of the JAK2-STAT3 signaling pathway, suggesting that this may be an important pathway in muscle growth and/or hypertrophy.","['Spangenburg, Espen E', 'Booth, Frank W']","['Spangenburg EE', 'Booth FW']","['Department of Biomedical Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Missouri-Columbia, Columbia, Missouri 65211, USA.']",['eng'],['AG-18780/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Physiol Cell Physiol,American journal of physiology.

We included a subset of cases from a population-based case-control study in a case-only study to estimate the interaction odds ratios (IORs) between prenatal and postnatal exposure to THMs and polymorphisms in the GSTT1 and CYP2E1 genes. We compared cases with and without a given variant regarding their exposure to THMs using unconditional logistic regression. The IOR for a postnatal average of total THM above the 95th percentile with GSTT1 null genotype was 9.1 [95% confidence interval (95% CI), 1.4-57.8]. With CYP2E1 (variant G-1259C, known as the allele CYP2E1*5), the effect of exposure during pregnancy for an average exposure to total THM at or above the 75th percentile was 9.7 (95% CI, 1.1-86.0). These results contrast strongly with those from our case-control analysis, in which we considered the exposure to THMs only in relation with ALL, and observed no increase in risk or very moderate ones. The present preliminary study shows suggestive but imprecise results. We found no similar results in the literature, underscoring the need for other studies as well as the potential usefulness of combining exposure and relevant genetic information in such studies.","['Infante-Rivard, Claire', 'Amre, Devendra', 'Sinnett, Daniel']","['Infante-Rivard C', 'Amre D', 'Sinnett D']","['Joint Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Faculty of Medicine, McGill University Montreal, Quebec, Canada. cirivard@epid.Ian.mcgill.ca']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Environ Health Perspect,Environmental health perspectives,0330411,"['0 (Trihalomethanes)', 'EC 1.14.13.- (Cytochrome P-450 CYP2E1)', 'EC 2.5.1.- (glutathione S-transferase T1)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2E1/*biosynthesis/genetics', '*Environmental Exposure', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Glutathione Transferase/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Odds Ratio', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*chemically induced/genetics', 'Pregnancy', '*Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects', 'Risk Assessment', 'Trihalomethanes/*adverse effects', '*Water Supply']",2002/06/11 10:00,2002/07/24 10:01,['2002/06/11 10:00'],"['2002/06/11 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/07/24 10:01 [medline]', '2002/06/11 10:00 [entrez]']","['sc271_5_1835 [pii]', '10.1289/ehp.02110591 [doi]']",ppublish,Environ Health Perspect. 2002 Jun;110(6):591-3. doi: 10.1289/ehp.02110591.,,,PMC1240875,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Five-lipoxygenase activity was not directly involved since the direct redox-dependent 5-LPOx inhibitor, SC-41661A did not increase Ca(2+). U937 cells subsequently undergo classic type 1 programmed cell death. At least initially the ionized calcium originates from internal stores. Coincident with the rise in U937 ionized calcium, MK 886 rapidly increased reactive oxygen species and reduced mitochondrial membrane potential, as judged by several fluorescent probes. The Ca(2+) response of myeloid leukemia-derived HL-60 cells to MK 886 was similar and both cell lines express Bcl-2 protein. Bcl-2-negative Panc-1 and PC-3 cells did not respond to MK 886 with a Ca(2+) signal but did develop oxidative stress and a decline in mitochondrial membrane potential; these events are thought to contribute to the inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of a type 2 PCD. In addition to its marked inhibition of Bcl-2 mRNA synthesis, an interesting hypothesis is that MK 886, serving as a low molecular weight ligand, either by direct or indirect inhibition of U937 Bcl-2 protein function, possibly related to an ion channel activity, alters the distribution of intracellular, possibly nuclear Ca(2+), thereby promoting the development of type 1 programmed cell death.","['Anderson, K M', 'Alrefai, W A', 'Dudeja, P K', 'Jadko, S', 'Bonomi, P', 'Hu, Y', 'Ou, D', 'Harris, J E']","['Anderson KM', 'Alrefai WA', 'Dudeja PK', 'Jadko S', 'Bonomi P', 'Hu Y', 'Ou D', 'Harris JE']","['Department of Medicine, Section of Medical Oncology, Chicago, IL 60612, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Scotland,Prostaglandins Leukot Essent Fatty Acids,"Prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and essential fatty acids",8802730,"['0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Lipoxygenase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '080626SQ8C (MK-886)', 'EC 1.13.11.34 (Arachidonate 5-Lipoxygenase)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Arachidonate 5-Lipoxygenase/metabolism', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Calcium Signaling/*drug effects', 'Cytosol/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Indoles/*pharmacology', 'Lipoxygenase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/metabolism', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/analysis/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'U937 Cells']",2002/06/11 10:00,2003/01/10 04:00,['2002/06/11 10:00'],"['2002/06/11 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/10 04:00 [medline]', '2002/06/11 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1054/plef.2001.0372 [doi]', 'S0952327801903722 [pii]']",ppublish,Prostaglandins Leukot Essent Fatty Acids. 2002 Apr;66(4):443-52. doi: 10.1054/plef.2001.0372.,,,,,,,,,['Copyright 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Among these proteins, eIF4GI, which is targeted by picornaviral proteases, makes a bridge between the mRNA cap structure (via eIF4E) and the 40 S ribosome (via eIF3). Recently, internal ribosome entry segment (IRES) elements have been characterized in the genomic RNA of both simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), suggesting that viral expression of these two viruses can be regulated at the translational level. Thus, by analogy with members of the picornavirus family, we have investigated the action of the HIV-1 protease on initiation factors eIF4GI and eIF4GII using cell extracts and the rabbit reticulocyte lysate system. Our results show that eIF4GI, but not eIF4GII, is substrate for HIV-1 protease and this effect can be prevented by a HIV-1 protease inhibitor, palinavir. However, in contrast to picornaviral proteases, the cleavage of eIF4GI by HIV-1 protease occurs at multiple sites and impairs translation of both cap-dependent and IRES-containing RNAs, except for the HCV IRES, which does not require eIF4GI or eIF4GII for activity.","['Ohlmann, Theophile', 'Prevot, Deborah', 'Decimo, Didier', 'Roux, Florence', 'Garin, Jerome', 'Morley, Simon J', 'Darlix, Jean-Luc']","['Ohlmann T', 'Prevot D', 'Decimo D', 'Roux F', 'Garin J', 'Morley SJ', 'Darlix JL']","[""LaboRetro, Inserm U412, Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon, 46 Allee d'Italie, 69364 Lyon cedex 07, France. tohlmann@ens-lyon.fr""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Mol Biol,Journal of molecular biology,2985088R,"['0 (EIF4G1 protein, human)', '0 (EIF4G2 protein, human)', '0 (Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-4G)', '0 (HIV Protease Inhibitors)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Peptide Initiation Factors)', '0 (Quinolines)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '632S1WU9Z2 (palinavir)', 'EC 3.4.23.- (HIV Protease)', 'HG18B9YRS7 (Valine)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', '*Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-4G', 'HIV Protease/genetics/*metabolism', 'HIV Protease Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'HIV-1/*enzymology/physiology', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia', 'Peptide Fragments/genetics/*metabolism', 'Peptide Initiation Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Biosynthesis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Quinolines/pharmacology', 'Rabbits', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Reticulocytes', 'Ribosomes/metabolism', 'Sequence Analysis, Protein', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Valine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology']",2002/06/11 10:00,2002/07/13 10:01,['2002/06/11 10:00'],"['2002/06/11 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/07/13 10:01 [medline]', '2002/06/11 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1016/S0022-2836(02)00070-0 [doi]', 'S0022-2836(02)00070-0 [pii]']",ppublish,J Mol Biol. 2002 Apr 19;318(1):9-20. doi: 10.1016/S0022-2836(02)00070-0.,,,,,,,,,['Copyright 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We hypothesise that one mechanism of gene deregulation involves overcoming the silencing mechanism(s) of gene expression present in normal cells. Here, we describe a search for trans-acting factors that control transcriptional activity from a distal 5' region of the HOX11 promoter. We have identified a region of this promoter which contributes significantly to HOX11 activation and two distinct regulatory elements are involved. First, a PBX2 Regulatory Element PRE-1048 has been identified which contains a novel DNA-binding sequence and mediates significant activation of the HOX11 gene in K562 cells. This is the first report of a homeobox gene being specifically regulated by PBX2 and the second report of a vertebrate homeobox target gene of a PBX protein. The PREP1 protein was also shown to be part of the PRE-1048-binding complex. The other regulatory element we describe here RE-1019 contains little sequence conservation to known transcription control elements. It appears that this element is a novel sequence that binds an as yet unidentified factor, mediating significant activation of the HOX11 gene in K562 cells.

Splicing occurs both in packaging cells producing the MLV-vectors as well as in the infected target cells. Transcripts lacking the Psi-sequence (Psi(-)) are packaged relatively efficiently into virus particles, even in the presence of wild type Psi(+)-vector transcripts. The Psi(-)-viral RNA is reverse transcribed in vector transduced cells as is any other retroviral genome. The titer obtained from the Psi(-)-vector was only 1000-fold reduced in comparison to the same Psi(+)-vector.

We conclude that the signal for apoptosis induced by H(2)O(2) in the MPO-containing HL-60 cell involves the reaction of the diffusible oxidant HOCl with amines producing chloramines and a subsequent non-TNB-reactive product.","['Wagner, Brett A', 'Britigan, Bradley E', 'Reszka, Krzysztof J', 'McCormick, Michael L', 'Burns, C Patrick']","['Wagner BA', 'Britigan BE', 'Reszka KJ', 'McCormick ML', 'Burns CP']","['Department of Medicine and Radiation Oncology (Free Radical and Radiation Biology Graduate Program), The University of Iowa College of Medicine, Iowa City, IA 52242, USA.']",['eng'],"['P01 CA 66081/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI 34954/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Arch Biochem Biophys,Archives of biochemistry and biophysics,0372430,"['0 (Chloramines)', '0 (Chlorides)', '0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Nitrobenzoates)', '0 (Oxidants)', '0 (Sulfhydryl Compounds)', '15139-21-6 (thionitrobenzoic acid)', '712K4CDC10 (Hypochlorous Acid)', 'AE28F7PNPL (Methionine)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Chloramines/*metabolism', 'Chlorides/metabolism', 'Culture Media', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/*pharmacology', 'Hypochlorous Acid/*metabolism', 'Methionine/pharmacology', 'Models, Biological', 'Necrosis', 'Nitrobenzoates/metabolism', 'Oxidants/metabolism', 'Sulfhydryl Compounds']",2002/06/11 10:00,2002/07/02 10:01,['2002/06/11 10:00'],"['2002/06/11 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/07/02 10:01 [medline]', '2002/06/11 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1016/S0003-9861(02)00053-X [doi]', 'S0003-9861(02)00053-X [pii]']",ppublish,Arch Biochem Biophys. 2002 May 15;401(2):223-34. doi: 10.1016/S0003-9861(02)00053-X.,,,,,,,,,['(c) 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We studied bone mineral density (BMD), percent of fat mass (%FM), and activity levels in survivors of ALL treated without radiotherapy. Lumbar and total areal BMD (g/cm2) and %FM were measured in 28 survivors (aged 5.7-14.7 years) of childhood ALL by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan (GE Lunar, Prodigy) an average of 5 years after completion of chemotherapy (UK Medical Research Council randomized trial protocol XI [UKALL XI]). One boy fractured his arm during treatment. Apparent volumetric lumbar BMD (BMD(vol); g/cm3) was calculated and %FM was adjusted for sex and age (%FM(adj)). Physical activity was measured by accelerometer and questionnaire. The results were compared with 28 sex- and age-matched healthy controls. Total body and lumbar areal BMD (g/cm2) were not different between the ALL group and the control group. However, mean lumbar BMD(vol) in survivors of ALL was significantly lower than in controls (0.303 +/- 0.036 g/cm3 vs. 0.323 +/- 0.03 g/cm3; p < 0.01), which mostly was caused by the difference in boys (0.287 +/- 0.032 g/cm3 vs. 0.312 +/- 0.027 g/cm3; p < 0.05). Weekly activity score by questionnaire was significantly lower in the ALL group than in the control group (geometric mean 50 vs. geometric mean 74; p < 0.05). Male gender, low activity levels and an intravenous (iv) high dose of methotrexate were associated with low lumbar BMD(vol). Patients who received an iv high dose of methotrexate (n = 18) had significantly higher %FM(adj) than those with intrathecal methotrexate only (n = 10; 141 +/- 70% vs. 98 +/- 37%;p < 0.05). In conclusion, male survivors of childhood ALL have reduced lumbar BMD(vol), whereas no such difference was seen in girls. Overall, survivors of ALL were physically less active than their healthy controls and lower activity correlated with lower lumbar BMD(vol) and higher %FM(adj).","['Tillmann, V', 'Darlington, A S E', 'Eiser, C', 'Bishop, N J', 'Davies, H A']","['Tillmann V', 'Darlington AS', 'Eiser C', 'Bishop NJ', 'Davies HA']","[""Department of Child Health, Sheffield Children's Hospital, Western Bank, United Kingdom.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Bone Miner Res,Journal of bone and mineral research : the official journal of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research,8610640,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', '*Bone Density', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Exercise', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnostic imaging/drug therapy/*physiopathology', 'Radiography', 'Spine/*pathology', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', '*Survivors']",2002/06/11 10:00,2002/11/26 04:00,['2002/06/11 10:00'],"['2002/06/11 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/11/26 04:00 [medline]', '2002/06/11 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1359/jbmr.2002.17.6.1073 [doi]'],ppublish,J Bone Miner Res. 2002 Jun;17(6):1073-80. doi: 10.1359/jbmr.2002.17.6.1073.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Novartis.,492-9,"Novartis has launched imatinib, an inhibitor of tyrosine kinases, including Bcr-Abl, for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Imatinib selectively inhibits activation of target proteins involved in cellular proliferation. It also inhibits c-KIT tyrosine kinase activity and is equally effective against both wild-type and constitutively active enzyme. Close correlation between in vitro responses to IFNalpha and imatinib suggested that it may be an alternative to IFNalpha therapy for chronic-phase CML, and the compound has the advantage that it can be administered orally. Futhermore, Bcr-Abl-expressing cells treated with imatinib undergo apoptosis. Imatinib also has potential for the treatment of other cancers that express these kinases, including acute lymphocytic leukemia and certain solid tumors. In February 2002, the FDA approved imatinib for the treatment of inoperable and/or metastatic malignant gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST); in September 2001, launch for the indication was expected in 2002. In November 2000, imatinib was granted Orphan Drug status in Japan for the target indication of Philadelphia chromosome-positive leukemia. By May 2001, imatinib had entered phase II trials for small cell lung cancer, prostate cancer and glioma. Imatinib has been launched in more than 35 countries, including the US, Brazil, Switzerland, Australia and the UK. By December 2001, the drug had also been launched in Japan. The drug is marketed as Gleevec (imatinib mesilate) in the US, and Glivec (imatinib) outside the US. In August 2001, Deutsche Bank estimated sales of SFr 233 million in 2001, rising to SFr 850 million in 2005; while Bear Stearns & Co predicted sales of SFr 250 million in 2001, rising to SFr 800 million in 2005.","['Radford, Ian R']",['Radford IR'],"['Peter MacCallum Cancer Institute, East Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. i.radford@pmci.unimelb.edu.au']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Curr Opin Investig Drugs,"Current opinion in investigational drugs (London, England : 2000)",100965718,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Clinical Trials, Phase I as Topic', 'Clinical Trials, Phase II as Topic', 'Clinical Trials, Phase III as Topic', 'Contraindications', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Piperazines/adverse effects/chemical synthesis/metabolism/pharmacology/*therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/adverse effects/chemical synthesis/metabolism/pharmacology/*therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",2002/06/11 10:00,2002/11/26 04:00,['2002/06/11 10:00'],"['2002/06/11 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/11/26 04:00 [medline]', '2002/06/11 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Curr Opin Investig Drugs. 2002 Mar;3(3):492-9.,,,,,,,63,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

So far, eight complementation groups have been identified, and the genes of four of them have been cloned. Early-onset progressive bone marrow failure and a predisposition to malignancies, particularly acute myelogenous leukemia, liver tumors, and mucocutaneous squamous cell carcinomas, result in a poor prognosis. Additionally, almost all organs can be affected by this defect. Widespread areas of hyper- and hypopigmentation of the skin in a characteristic pattern and cafe-au-lait spots preceding the manifestation of panmyelopathy can aid early diagnosis. Here we report an 11-year-old boy with Fanconi's anemia presenting with typical cutaneous manifestations.

The finding of bacteria in blood smears has to be interpreted carefully, and thorough examination of peripheral blood smears may be of great importance in the early diagnosis of bacteremia; however, in vitro contamination must be excluded.","['van der Meer, W', 'Verwiel, J M M', 'Gidding, C E M', 'de Metz, M', 'de Keijzer, M H']","['van der Meer W', 'Verwiel JM', 'Gidding CE', 'de Metz M', 'de Keijzer MH']","['Department of Clinical Chemistry, University Medical Center St. Radboud Nijmegen, The Netherlands. w.vandermeer@ckcl.azn.nl']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Switzerland,Acta Haematol,Acta haematologica,0141053,,IM,"['Animals', 'Bacteremia/blood/*diagnosis', 'Bites and Stings/complications', 'Blood/*microbiology', 'Catheterization, Central Venous', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Dogs', '*Equipment Contamination', 'False Positive Reactions', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pneumatosis Cystoides Intestinalis/blood', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications', 'Staphylococcal Infections/blood/diagnosis', 'Streptococcal Infections/blood/diagnosis', 'Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome/blood/*diagnosis', 'Wound Infection/diagnosis']",2002/06/08 10:00,2002/07/16 10:01,['2002/06/08 10:00'],"['2002/06/08 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/07/16 10:01 [medline]', '2002/06/08 10:00 [entrez]']","['58318 [pii]', '10.1159/000058318 [doi]']",ppublish,Acta Haematol. 2002;107(4):220-3. doi: 10.1159/000058318.,,,,,,,,,"['Copyright 2002 S.

Auto-PBSCT reduced the abdominal lymphoma mass and IFN-alpha eliminated residual tumor cells, possibly through the induction of specific T-cell subsets expressing CD3, CD8 on their surfaces and either IFN-gamma or tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha in cytoplasm. We have treated a total of 4 ATLL patients with auto-PBSCT, including the case presented herein. All other patients treated with auto-PBSCT were not followed by adjuvant chemotherapy or cytokine therapy and relapsed within 3 months after auto-PBSCT.

To evaluate the outcome of patients with ALL managed by the public healthcare system, we studied 42 adults treated from 1990 to 1997 in the Division of Hematology at Hospital de Clinicas, Porto Alegre, Brazil. Of these patients, 14/42 were females and their median age at diagnosis was 26 (17-64) years. The diagnosis of ALL was based on cytological examination of marrow smears, and immunophenotypic and cytogenetic studies, when available. Fifty percent of the patients expressed CD10, 30% were CD10 negative and CD19 positive and 20% expressed T markers. Philadelphia chromosome was found in 4 (7.14%).

Tax activates viral transcription through interaction with the cellular transcription factor CREB and the coactivators CBP/p300. One key property of the coactivators is the presence of histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity, which enables p300/CBP to modify nucleosome structure. The data presented in this manuscript demonstrate that full-length p300 and CBP facilitate transcription of a reconstituted chromatin template in the presence of Tax and CREB. The ability of p300 and CBP to activate transcription from the chromatin template is dependent upon the HAT activity. Moreover, the coactivator HAT activity must be tethered to the template by Tax and CREB, since a p300 mutant that fails to interact with Tax did not facilitate transcription or acetylate histones. p300 acetylates histones H3 and H4 within nucleosomes located in the promoter and 5' proximal regions of the template. Nucleosome acetylation is accompanied by an increase in the level of binding of RNA polymerase II transcription factor TFIID and RNA polymerase II to the promoter. Interestingly, we found distinct transcriptional activities between CBP and p300. CBP, but not p300, possesses an N-terminal activation domain which directly activates Tax-mediated HTLV-1 transcription from a naked DNA template. Finally, using the chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, we provide the first direct experimental evidence that p300 and CBP are associated with the HTLV-1 long terminal repeat in vivo.","['Lu, Hanxin', 'Pise-Masison, Cynthia A', 'Fletcher, Terace M', 'Schiltz, R Louis', 'Nagaich, Akhilesh K', 'Radonovich, Michael', 'Hager, Gordon', 'Cole, Philip A', 'Brady, John N']","['Lu H', 'Pise-Masison CA', 'Fletcher TM', 'Schiltz RL', 'Nagaich AK', 'Radonovich M', 'Hager G', 'Cole PA', 'Brady JN']","['Virus Tumor Biology Section, Basic Research Laboratory, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Nucleosomes)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factor TFIID)', '0 (Transcription Factors, TFII)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (CREB-Binding Protein)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (CREBBP protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (RNA Polymerase II)']",IM,"['Acetylation', 'CREB-Binding Protein', 'Chromatin/*genetics/metabolism', 'Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Products, tax/genetics/*metabolism', 'HeLa Cells', 'Histones/*metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Nucleosomes/genetics/metabolism', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA Polymerase II/genetics/metabolism', 'Response Elements/genetics', 'Templates, Genetic', 'Terminal Repeat Sequences', 'Trans-Activators/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factor TFIID', 'Transcription Factors, TFII/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic']",2002/06/08 10:00,2002/07/19 10:01,['2002/06/08 10:00'],"['2002/06/08 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/07/19 10:01 [medline]', '2002/06/08 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/MCB.22.13.4450-4462.2002 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2002 Jul;22(13):4450-62. doi: 10.1128/MCB.22.13.4450-4462.2002.,,,PMC133924,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The natural products are extremely stable to nucleophilic attack until bound to their DNA target and are not substrates for any other biological nucleophile. The mechanism for this target activation of the duocarmycins is discussed with relation to both an acid-catalyzed activation and a binding-induced conformational change leading to ground state destabilization. It is suggested that targeting of the duocarmycins to their site of action in a tumour may be more important than introducing systemically-activated prodrugs as the natural product itself can be considered to be a type of prodrug, activated only on binding to its targets. Methods that have been used to target CC-1065 and the duocarmycins are reviewed as well as efforts towards systemically activated prodrugs. A simple analysis of the approaches that could be taken to vary the structure for targeting is suggested.","['Searcey, Mark']",['Searcey M'],"['Department of Pharmaceutical and Biological Chemistry, University of London School of Pharmacy, 29/39 Brunswick Square, London, WC1N 1AX, UK. mark.searcey@ams1.ulsop.ac.uk']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United Arab Emirates,Curr Pharm Des,Current pharmaceutical design,9602487,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '0 (Duocarmycins)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Leucomycins)', '0 (Prodrugs)', '0 (Pyrroles)', '0 (Pyrrolidinones)', '118292-35-6 (pyrindamycin B)', '118292-36-7 (pyrindamycin A)', '124325-93-5 (duocarmycin B1)', '124325-94-6 (duocarmycin B2)', '130288-24-3 (duocarmycin SA)', '69866-21-3 (CC 1065)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'PJV9990868 (duocarmycin A)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*chemistry/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/*chemistry/pharmacology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'DNA/*chemistry', 'Drug Stability', 'Duocarmycins', '*Indoles', 'Leucomycins/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Leukemia L1210', 'Prodrugs/*chemistry/pharmacology', 'Pyrroles/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Pyrrolidinones/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/06/08 10:00,2002/11/26 04:00,['2002/06/08 10:00'],"['2002/06/08 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/11/26 04:00 [medline]', '2002/06/08 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.2174/1381612023394539 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Pharm Des. 2002;8(15):1375-89. doi: 10.2174/1381612023394539.,,,,,,,60,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, the drug has recently shown promising antitumor activity in a patient affected by primary brain lymphoma and is currently under phase II clinical trials for leptomeningeal metastases from leukemia and lymphoma or for brain metastases from lung and breast cancers. The antitumor activity of TMZ, that generates different types of methyl adducts (70% N7-methylguanine, 10% N3-methyladenine and 9% O6-methylguanine), has been mainly attributed to the formation of O6-methylguanine adducts. Indeed, tumor cell susceptibility to TMZ is strongly affected by the functional status of DNA repair systems, involved either in the removal of methyl adducts from O6G or in the apoptotic signaling triggered by O6-methylG:T mispairs. This review will focus on the different pharmacological strategies aimed at overcoming tumor resistance to TMZ such as new formulations of the drug or dosing schedules, and combined treatments with other chemotherapeutic agents, modulators of DNA repair systems, or gene therapy. The potential use of N3-methyladenine selective agents in the case of tumors tolerant to O6-methylguanine will be also discussed.","['Tentori, Lucio', 'Graziani, Grazia']","['Tentori L', 'Graziani G']","['Department of Neuroscience, University of Rome Tor Vergata, Via Montpellier 1, 00133, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United Arab Emirates,Curr Med Chem,Current medicinal chemistry,9440157,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '7GR28W0FJI (Dacarbazine)', 'EC 2.1.1.63 (O(6)-Methylguanine-DNA Methyltransferase)', 'YF1K15M17Y (Temozolomide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/adverse effects/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'DNA Methylation/drug effects', 'DNA Repair/drug effects', 'Dacarbazine/adverse effects/analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'O(6)-Methylguanine-DNA Methyltransferase/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Temozolomide']",2002/06/08 10:00,2002/10/31 04:00,['2002/06/08 10:00'],"['2002/06/08 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/10/31 04:00 [medline]', '2002/06/08 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.2174/0929867023369916 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Med Chem. 2002 Jul;9(13):1285-301. doi: 10.2174/0929867023369916.,,,,,,,196,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this line, we discuss the critical role of FAAH in human peripheral lymphocytes, showing that the expression of this enzyme is regulated by progesterone, Th1 and Th2 cytokines, which also regulate fertility. Moreover, we show that AEA and the other endocannabinoid, 2-arachidonoylglycerol, inhibit the release of the fertility-promoting cytokine leukemia inhibitory factor from human lymphocytes. Taken together, low FAAH and consistently high blood levels of AEA, but not CB receptors or AMT, can be early (<8 weeks of gestation) markers of spontaneous abortion, potentially useful as diagnostic tools for large-scale, routine monitoring of gestation in humans.","['Maccarrone, M', 'Falciglia, K', 'Di Rienzo, M', 'Finazzi-Agro, A']","['Maccarrone M', 'Falciglia K', 'Di Rienzo M', 'Finazzi-Agro A']","['Department of Experimental Medicine and Biochemical Sciences, University of Rome Tor Vergata, Via Montpellier 1, I-00133 Rome, Italy.

We previously reported that Aroclor 1254, one of the most widely used PCB mixtures, increased DNA fragmentation in mouse spleen cells, suggesting that apoptosis was correlated with the immunotoxicity of PCB (Yoo et al., Toxicol. Lett. 91, 83-89, 1997). In the present study we investigated the mechanism by which PCB induces apoptosis and the involvement of AhR in the PCB-mediated apoptosis of mouse spleen cells. Aroclor 1254 induced DNA fragmentation without AhR activation, and the apoptosis was unaffected by alpha-naphtoflavone, a well-known antagonist of AhR. Moreover, the PCB congeners (PCB 47, 52, 128, and 153), which have little affinity for AhR, induced DNA fragmentation, whereas congeners (PCB 77, 126, and 169) that have high affinity for AhR did not induce fragmentation. The di-ortho form of PCB (PCB 153) and Aroclor 1254 induced DNA fragmentation in the spleen cells of both AhR knockout mice and Ah low-response mice, whereas the non-ortho form of PCB (PCB 126) did not induce DNA fragmentation. In the light of these findings, it is evident that AhR is not involved in PCB-mediated apoptosis. PCB 153 significantly increased caspase-3 activity in both spleen cells and human leukemia cells, and z-VAD-fmk, a general inhibitor of caspases, prevented PCB-induced DNA fragmentation. Based on our findings, the most likely mechanism that can account for this biological effect involves the induction of caspase-dependent apoptotic cell death.","['Jeon, Young Jin', 'Youk, Eun Soo', 'Lee, Sang Han', 'Suh, Jaehong', 'Na, Yong Joo', 'Kim, Hwan Mook']","['Jeon YJ', 'Youk ES', 'Lee SH', 'Suh J', 'Na YJ', 'Kim HM']","['Department of Pharmacology, Chosun University School of Medicine, 375 Susukdong, Kwangju, Korea.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Toxicol Appl Pharmacol,Toxicology and applied pharmacology,0416575,"['0 (Benzoflavones)', '0 (Environmental Pollutants)', '0 (Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon)', '11097-69-1 (Chlorodiphenyl (54% Chlorine))', '604-59-1 (alpha-naphthoflavone)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', 'DFC2HB4I0K (Polychlorinated Biphenyls)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Casp3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Benzoflavones/pharmacology', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Chlorodiphenyl (54% Chlorine)/toxicity', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Environmental Pollutants/*toxicity', 'Female', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Polychlorinated Biphenyls/*toxicity', 'RNA/analysis', 'Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon/genetics/*metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Spleen/*drug effects/enzymology/pathology']",2002/06/08 10:00,2002/07/03 10:01,['2002/06/08 10:00'],"['2002/06/08 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/07/03 10:01 [medline]', '2002/06/08 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1006/taap.2002.9389 [doi]', 'S0041008X02993890 [pii]']",ppublish,Toxicol Appl Pharmacol. 2002 Jun 1;181(2):69-78. doi: 10.1006/taap.2002.9389.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These effects were investigated in relationship to the activation of p38 mitogen activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) and c-jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK) by arachidonic acid in these cell lines.

However, the native lipoprotein is difficult to obtain and handle. Previously, we showed that a lipidic emulsion (LDE) similar to the lipid structure of native LDL may bind to LDL receptors and be taken up by acute myelocytic leukemia cells. We also showed that LDE can also concentrate in ovarian cancer tissue. In this study, we tested whether LDE is taken up by breast carcinoma. METHODS: LDE labeled with (99m)Tc was injected into 18 breast cancer patients, and nuclear medicine images of the tumor and metastatic sites were acquired. Subsequently, LDE labeled with [3H]cholesteryl oleate was intravenously injected into 14 breast cancer patients 24-30 h before total mastectomy procedure. Fragments of normal and of breast cancer tissue excised during surgery were lipid extracted with chloroform/methanol and their radioactivity was measured in a scintillation solution. RESULTS: (99m)Tc-LDE images of the primary tumor and of metastasis sites were obtained in all 18 breast cancer patients. As directly measured in the tumor and in the normal mammary tissue, the amount of the emulsion radioactive label in the tumor was 4.5 times greater than in the normal tissue (range 1.2- to 8.8-fold). CONCLUSION: LDE concentrates much more in malignant breast tumor tissue than in the normal tissue. Thus it has potential to carry drugs or radionuclides directed against mammary carcinoma cells for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes.","['Graziani, Silvia R', 'Igreja, Fernando A F', 'Hegg, Roberto', 'Meneghetti, Claudio', 'Brandizzi, Laura I', 'Barboza, Renato', 'Amancio, Rosangela F', 'Pinotti, Jose A', 'Maranhao, Raul C']","['Graziani SR', 'Igreja FA', 'Hegg R', 'Meneghetti C', 'Brandizzi LI', 'Barboza R', 'Amancio RF', 'Pinotti JA', 'Maranhao RC']","['Department of Gynecology and Lipid Metabolism Laboratory of The Heart Institute (InCor), University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Gynecol Oncol,Gynecologic oncology,0365304,"['0 (Cholesterol Esters)', '0 (Cholesterol, VLDL)', '0 (Emulsions)', '0 (Lipoproteins, HDL)', '0 (Lipoproteins, LDL)', '0 (Phosphatidylcholines)', '0 (Receptors, LDL)', '0 (Triglycerides)', '10028-17-8 (Tritium)', '122-32-7 (Triolein)', '3DPK9KFN2M (cholesteryl oleate)', '7440-26-8 (Technetium)', '97C5T2UQ7J (Cholesterol)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Breast Neoplasms/blood/diagnostic imaging/*metabolism', 'Carcinoma, Ductal, Breast/blood/diagnostic imaging/*metabolism', 'Cholesterol/blood/*pharmacokinetics', 'Cholesterol Esters/chemistry/pharmacokinetics', 'Cholesterol, VLDL/blood/metabolism', 'Emulsions/chemistry/pharmacokinetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lipoproteins, HDL/blood/metabolism', 'Lipoproteins, LDL/blood/metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Phosphatidylcholines/chemistry/pharmacokinetics', 'Radionuclide Imaging', 'Receptors, LDL/metabolism', 'Technetium', 'Triglycerides/blood', 'Triolein/chemistry/pharmacokinetics', 'Tritium']",2002/06/08 10:00,2002/07/24 10:01,['2002/06/08 10:00'],"['2002/06/08 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/07/24 10:01 [medline]', '2002/06/08 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0090825802966540 [pii]', '10.1006/gyno.2002.6654 [doi]']",ppublish,Gynecol Oncol. 2002 Jun;85(3):493-7. doi: 10.1006/gyno.2002.6654.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report here that aquaporin-1 (AQP1) is specifically induced by retinoic acid (RA) in human erythroleukemia HEL cells. Both all-trans-RA (ATRA) and 9-cis-RA (9CRA) strongly induced the AQP1 mRNA and protein in a dose-dependent manner. AQP1 protein was mainly expressed in plasma membrane in cells induced by RAs. To identify the RA response element (RARE) in the human AQP1 promoter, the 5(')-flanking region of AQP1 promoter was isolated and transient transfection experiment in HEL cells was performed. Deletion analysis of the AQP1 promoter revealed that one putative DR5-like RARE with five spaces was located in the region from -2218 to -2202; AGGGCAgggacAGGTGA. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) experiment demonstrated that two slowly migrated complexes (C1 and C2) capable of binding the RARE sequence were present in nuclear extracts prepared from cells and the complex C1 was strongly increased in nuclear extracts by RA stimulation. The complexes C1 and C2 were significantly abolished by an excess unlabeled probe. These results indicate that RAs strongly stimulate the human AQP1 gene expression through the RARE and define a novel role in the regulation of erythropoiesis.","['Umenishi, Fuminori', 'Schrier, Robert W']","['Umenishi F', 'Schrier RW']","['Division of Renal Diseases and Hypertension, Department of Medicine, University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, Denver, CO 80262, USA. fuminori.umenishi@uchsc.edu']",['eng'],['DK19928/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (AQP1 protein, human)', '0 (Aquaporins)', '0 (Blood Group Antigens)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '146410-94-8 (Aquaporin 1)', '1UA8E65KDZ (Alitretinoin)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Alitretinoin', 'Aquaporin 1', 'Aquaporins/analysis/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'Blood Group Antigens', 'Cell Membrane/chemistry', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/genetics/*metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Response Elements', '*Transcriptional Activation', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/06/08 10:00,2002/06/28 10:01,['2002/06/08 10:00'],"['2002/06/08 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/06/28 10:01 [medline]', '2002/06/08 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1016/S0006-291X(02)00316-9 [doi]', 'S0006-291X(02)00316-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2002 May 10;293(3):913-7. doi: 10.1016/S0006-291X(02)00316-9.,,,,,,,,,['(c) 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

LIF relaxed the mesenteric arteries in a dose-dependent manner, when the arterial rings were precontracted with phenylephrine. The relaxation was totally inhibited by mechanical removal of endothelium. N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester did not affect the relaxation by LIF. Ca(2+)-dependent K channel (KCa) blockers, apamin with charybdotoxin, inhibited the relaxation by LIF. Catalase, an enzyme which scavenges hydrogen peroxide, also inhibited the relaxation by LIF.

DESIGN: Prospective study. ANIMALS: 161 cows with positive results of ELISA for BLV. PROCEDURE: Sample-to-positive ratio (S:P), which is the ratio between the test sample and a positive control sample, was compared among lymphocytotic and nonlymphocytotic cows. A regression model was constructed to evaluate the association between blood lymphocyte concentration and S:P, age, and the interaction of these terms. RESULTS: Mean S:P differed significantly between lymphocytotic (2.58 +/- 0.36) and nonlymphocytotic (2.38 +/- 0.39) cows. Age and S:P were significantly associated with lymphocyte count. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Sample-to-positive ratio and lymphocyte count were related; however, cows with high S:P were not always lymphocytotic. Culling cows on the basis of S:P will reduce the herd load of infectious virus faster than random culling of ELISA-positive cows; however, culling on the basis of lymphocyte count will eliminate a greater proportion of the reservoir of infection.","['Nagy, Dusty W', 'Tyler, Jeff W', 'Stoker, Aaron', 'Kleiboeker, Steven B']","['Nagy DW', 'Tyler JW', 'Stoker A', 'Kleiboeker SB']","['Department of Veterinary Clinical Medicine, College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Illinois, Urbana 61802, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,J Am Vet Med Assoc,Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association,7503067,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/*blood', 'Cattle', 'Enzootic Bovine Leukosis/blood/*diagnosis/immunology', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay/methods/*veterinary', 'Female', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Count/veterinary', 'Lymphocytosis/diagnosis/*veterinary', 'Prospective Studies']",2002/06/08 10:00,2002/09/14 10:01,['2002/06/08 10:00'],"['2002/06/08 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/14 10:01 [medline]', '2002/06/08 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.2460/javma.2002.220.1681 [doi]'],ppublish,J Am Vet Med Assoc. 2002 Jun 1;220(11):1681-4. doi: 10.2460/javma.2002.220.1681.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHOD: We searched the Eli Lilly and Company's computerized adverse event database for all reported cases of hyponatremia and/or SIADH as of 1 November 1999 that had been reported during the use of vincristine. RESULTS: A total of 76 cases of hyponatremia and/or SIADH associated with vincristine use were identified. The overall reporting rate was estimated to be 1.3/100,000 treated patients. The average age of patients was 35.6 +/- 28.3 years, and 62% were males. Approximately 75% of the patients were receiving treatment for leukemia or lymphoma.

METHODS: Autologous BM of patients with chronic myelogenous leukaemia (n = 11) and PBSC of patients with multiple myeloma (n = 14) were activated by IL-2 in laboratory conditions with the aim of evaluating the feasibility of this method, the activation of T and NK cells, recovery of active progenitor cells, microbial contamination, and reduction of malignant cell content. RESULTS: Samples of BM (mean 2.6 x 10(6) cells) and PBSC (mean 10.3 x 10(6) cells) were cultured in complete culture medium with IL-2 (6000 Ul/ml) for 24 h. The recovery of CD34+ cells and CFU-GM was 82.5% and 51.5%, respectively, for BM, and 85% and 86%, respectively, for PBSC (mean values).

So, it is likely an overall involvement of tumoral cell metabolism. The aim of this study was to evaluate clinico-biological implications of altered lipid profiles in oncohaematologic patients. DESIGN AND METHODS: The plasma lipids, lipoproteins and apolipoproteins were determined at the time of diagnosis in 48 previously untreated patients (35M, 13F, median age 60 years), 11 with multiple myeloma (MM), 11 with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), 11 with acute leukemia (AL), 10 with chronic myeloproliferative disorders (CMD) and 5 with B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL). The results were correlated with known prognostic serum markers, such as lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), beta-2-microglobulin (beta 2m), and soluble molecule ICAM1 (sICAM1). RESULTS: Altered blood lipid profiles were observed in all concohaematologic patients. Statistically significant values included reduced cholesterol (155 +/- 47.36 vs 205 +/- 35 mg/dl; p < 0.001), HDL-C (30.47 +/- 13.36 vs 45 +/- 10 mg/dl; p < 0.003) and apo A (118.86 +/- 49.98 vs 182.69 mg/dl; p < 0.0001) levels. No correlations were found between cholesterol levels and clinico-biological features representative of tumor mass (LDH, beta 2m, sICAM-1). A significant increase of cholesterol levels was observed in all patients responding to therapy. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSION: These results support the idea that the cholesterol, its fractions and the apolipoproteins determinations might be considered as useful biochemical and prognostic markers in hematologic neoplasms.","['Musolino, Caterina', 'Calabro, Luana', 'Bellomo, Giacomo', 'Cincotta, Maria', 'Di Giacomo, Valeria', 'Pezzano, Caterina', 'Loteta, Barbara', 'Rizzo, Vincenzo', 'Guglielmo, Salvatore', 'Alonci, Andrea']","['Musolino C', 'Calabro L', 'Bellomo G', 'Cincotta M', 'Di Giacomo V', 'Pezzano C', 'Loteta B', 'Rizzo V', 'Guglielmo S', 'Alonci A']","['Divisione di Ematologia, Dipartimento di Medicina Interna, Universita, Messina. camilla.si@tiscalinet.it']",['ita'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Italy,Recenti Prog Med,Recenti progressi in medicina,0401271,"['0 (Apolipoproteins)', '97C5T2UQ7J (Cholesterol)']",IM,"['Apolipoproteins/*blood', 'Cholesterol/*blood', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*blood', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",2002/06/08 10:00,2003/02/07 04:00,['2002/06/08 10:00'],"['2002/06/08 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/02/07 04:00 [medline]', '2002/06/08 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Recenti Prog Med. 2002 May;93(5):298-301.,,,,,Profilo lipidico nelle neoplasie ematologiche.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Special immunogenetic conditions to establish chimerism are combined with bone marrow transplantation, transfusion and various kinds of solid organ grafting. There are various methods to detect the type of chimera state depending on the immunogenetic differences between the donor and recipient.

Alternative therapy with interferon-alpha appears to prolong survival but is probably not curative. The aim of the study is to analyse the clinical results of the first Hungarian autologous transplantations in CML. METHODS: Seven patients were treated with ICE-based regimen plus G-CSF with the aim of mobilising and collecting Ph-negative peripheral stem cells in the setting of autologous transplant program. Five patients had CML in first chronic phase and two in accelerated phase. All patients have been previously treated with interferon-alpha. RESULTS: Median value and ranges for harvested mononuclear cells, CD34(+) cells and CFU-GM were: 5.65x10(8)/kg (2.61-11.38), 1.48x10(6)/kg (0.216-3.5) and 3.43x10(4)/kg (0.243-11.6), respectively. Four out of seven autologous grafts have been transplanted. Busulfan conditioning was used in one case and TBI/Cy conditioning in three patients. All patients are alive and well post-transplant being on interferon-alpha therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the clinical advantages of autologous transplantation including long-term chronic phase, achievement of second chronic phase and improved response to interferon-alpha therapy, the procedure can offer an alternative treatment in CML in lack of HLA-identical donor.","['Gopcsa, L', 'Barta, A', 'Banyai, A', 'Foldi, J', 'Kalasz, L', 'Pajor, L', 'Gidali, J', 'Paloczi, K']","['Gopcsa L', 'Barta A', 'Banyai A', 'Foldi J', 'Kalasz L', 'Pajor L', 'Gidali J', 'Paloczi K']","['National Institute of Haematology and Immunology, Budapest, Hungary.']",['hun'],,['Journal Article'],Hungary,Magy Onkol,Magyar onkologia,9313833,,,,2002/06/07 10:00,2002/06/07 10:00,['2002/06/07 10:00'],"['2002/06/07 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/06/07 10:00 [medline]', '2002/06/07 10:00 [entrez]']",['HUON.2001.45.1.0009 [doi]'],ppublish,Magy Onkol. 2001;45(1):9-13. doi: HUON.2001.45.1.0009.,,,,,Autolog hemopoetikus ossejt-transzplantacio eredmenyei chronicus myeloid leukaemiaban.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast, similar amounts of virions recovered from human fibrosarcoma HT1080 cells result in 10-fold-higher transduction rates (G. Duisit, A. Salvetti, P. Moullier, and F. Cosset, Hum. Gene Ther. 10:189-200, 1999). We have now extended this initial observation to other type-C envelope (Env) pseudotypes and analyzed the mechanism involved. Structural and morphological analysis showed that viral particles recovered from A549 (A549-MLV) and HT1080 (HT1080-MLV) cells were normal and indistinguishable from each other. They expressed equivalent levels of mature Env proteins and bound similarly to the target cells. Furthermore, incoming particles reached the cytosol and directed the synthesis of linear viral DNA equally efficiently. However, almost no detectable circular DNAs could be detected in A549-MLV-infected cells, indicating that the block of infection resulted from defective nuclear translocation of the preintegration complex. Interestingly, pseudotyping of A549-MLV with vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein G restored the amount of circular DNA forms as well as the transduction rates to HT1080-MLV levels, suggesting that the postentry blockage could be overcome by endocytic delivery of the core particles downstream of the restriction point. Thus, in contrast to the previously described target cell-dependent Fv-1 (or Fv1-like) restriction in mammalian cells (P. Pryciak and H. E. Varmus, J. Virol. 66:5959-5966, 1992; G. Towers, M.

We found that PLC-beta2, virtually absent in untreated NB4 cells, was strongly up-regulated after ATRA-induced granulocytic differentiation. Remarkably, using primary blasts purified from bone marrow of patients affected by APL successfully induced to remission by treatment with ATRA, we showed a striking correlation between the amount of PLC-beta2 expression and the responsiveness of APL blasts to the differentiative activity of ATRA. An increase of PLC-beta2 expression also characterized the cytokine-induced granulocytic differentiation of CD34+ normal hematopoietic progenitors. Taken together, these data show that PLC-beta2 represents a sensitive and reliable marker of neutrophil maturation of normal and malignant myeloid progenitors.

In addition, recently, FDA approved Gleevec for the treatment of gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST). In order to support all toxicokinetic (TK) studies with sufficient speed to meet various target dates, a semi-automated procedure using solid phase extraction (SPE) was developed and validated. A Packard Multi-Probe I and a SPE step in a 96-well plate format were utilized. A 3M Empore octyl (C(8))-standard density 96-well plate was used for plasma sample extraction. A Sciex API 3000 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer with an atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) interface operated in positive ion mode was used for detection. Lower limits of quantification of 1.00 and 2.00 ng/ml were attained for STI571 and its metabolite, CGP 74588, respectively. The method proved to be rugged and allowed the simultaneous quantification of STI571 and CGP 74588 in monkey plasma. Herein, assay development, validation, and representative concentration-time profiles obtained from TK studies are presented.","['Bakhtiar, R', 'Khemani, L', 'Hayes, M', 'Bedman, T', 'Tse, F']","['Bakhtiar R', 'Khemani L', 'Hayes M', 'Bedman T', 'Tse F']","['Department of Drug Metabolism and Pharmacokinetics, Novartis Institute for Biomedical Research, East Hanover, NJ 07936, USA. ray_bakhtiar@merck.com']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,J Pharm Biomed Anal,Journal of pharmaceutical and biomedical analysis,8309336,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*blood', 'Benzamides', 'Chromatography, Liquid/*methods', 'Haplorhini', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Mass Spectrometry/*methods', 'Piperazines/administration & dosage/*blood', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage/*blood', 'Reproducibility of Results']",2002/06/07 10:00,2002/07/18 10:01,['2002/06/07 10:00'],"['2002/06/07 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/07/18 10:01 [medline]', '2002/06/07 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0731708502000808 [pii]', '10.1016/s0731-7085(02)00080-8 [doi]']",ppublish,J Pharm Biomed Anal. 2002 Jun 15;28(6):1183-94. doi: 10.1016/s0731-7085(02)00080-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its potential to produce chronic toxic and/or oncogenic effects was investigated in Fischer 344 rats (100/sex/group) given GA in drinking water for a maximum of 104 weeks. GA concentrations were 0 (control), 50,250 and 1000 ppm, resulting in average daily GA consumptions, respectively, of 0, 4, 17 and 64 mg/kg for males and 0, 6, 25 and 86 mg/kg for females. Interim euthanasia (10/sex/group) was performed at 52 and 78 weeks. Parameters evaluated were clinical signs, body weight, food and water consumption, hematology, serum chemistry, urinalysis, organ weights, gross and microscopic pathology. There were no treatment-related effects on mortality. Absolute body weights and body weight gains of the 250 and 1000 ppm males and females were reduced over the study in a dosage-related manner. Food and water consumption by the 250 and 1000 ppm groups were decreased in a statistically significant dose-related manner over the study, and mean water consumption by the 50 ppm animals was slightly reduced but not with statistical significance. The 250 and 1000 ppm groups had a dose-related decrease in urine volume with increased osmolality, and pH was slightly reduced. Absolute kidney weights were increased in the 250 and 1000 ppm groups at the 52 and 78 week sacrifices, and decreased at 104 weeks. Relative kidney weights were increased at all sacrifice times for the 1000 ppm group, at 52 weeks for the 250 ppm group, and at 72 weeks for the 50 ppm group. The urinalysis and renal weight changes are compatible with a physiological compensatory adaptation to reduced water consumption. Gross and histological evidence for gastric irritation was observed principally in the 1000 ppm rats euthanized at 104 weeks and in animals that died during the study. Bone marrow hyperplasia and renal tubular pigmentation, seen in rats that died and the 104 week euthanasia animals, may have been secondary to a low grade hemolytic anemia in animals with large granular lymphocytic leukemia (LGLL). The only neoplasm that showed a statistically significant increase was LGLL, which occurred at a high incidence in both sexes and all groups, including the controls, for both animals that died and at the 104 week euthanasia. A few instances of LGLL were observed at 78 weeks. The overall incidence of LGLL in the spleen for the 0, 50, 250 and 1000 ppm groups was, respectively, 43, 51, 40 and 46% for males, and 24, 41, 41 and 53% for females. Statistical analyses indicated that the severity of LGLL was associated with the higher dosages of GA in female, but not male, rats. Due to the background and variable incidence of LGLL in the Fischer 344 rat, the finding of a statistical significance only for female rats, and because, there was no clear dose-response relationship, the biological significance of the LGLL findings is unclear. There is the possibility that the significance was a statistical artifact due to the low incidence of LGLL in the female control animals as a result of biological variability within the study. It is also considered to be possible that the chronic dosage of GA in the drinking water resulted in a modification of one or more of the factors responsible for the expression of this common and spontaneously occurring neoplasm in the Fischer 344 rat.","['Van Miller, John P', 'Hermansky, Steven J', 'Losco, Patricia E', 'Ballantyne, Bryan']","['Van Miller JP', 'Hermansky SJ', 'Losco PE', 'Ballantyne B']","['Applied Toxicology Group, Union Carbide Corporation, A Subsidiary of The Dow Chemical Company, 39 Old Ridgebury Road, Danbury, CT 06817, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Ireland,Toxicology,Toxicology,0361055,['T3C89M417N (Glutaral)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Blood Chemical Analysis', 'Body Weight/drug effects', 'Carcinogenicity Tests', 'Drinking/drug effects', 'Eating/drug effects', 'Female', 'Glutaral/*toxicity', 'Histocytochemistry', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*chemically induced', 'Male', 'Organ Size/drug effects', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred F344', 'Urinalysis']",2002/06/07 10:00,2002/07/31 10:01,['2002/06/07 10:00'],"['2002/06/07 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/07/31 10:01 [medline]', '2002/06/07 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0300483X0200080X [pii]', '10.1016/s0300-483x(02)00080-x [doi]']",ppublish,Toxicology. 2002 Jun 14;175(1-3):177-89. doi: 10.1016/s0300-483x(02)00080-x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its antitumor effect is expressed by combining with DNA during replication and then destroying the DNA chain. However, cytarabine has only limited activity against most solid tumors, including squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. The reason for this is thought to be that in cell lines of solid tumors the expression of cytidine deaminase, an enzyme that degrades cytarabine, is high, whereas the expression of deoxycytidine kinase (dCK), which phosphorylates cytarabine (a prodrug), is weak. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether head and neck squamous cell carcinomas can be made more sensitive to the cytotoxic effects of cytarabine by shifting the balance from the degradative to the activation pathway. METHODS: Human SCC-25 squamous carcinoma cells were transfected by either retroviral vector or adenoviral vector containing DCK gene and were identified for dCK expression by Northern blot analysis. In vitro cytotoxic assay after cytarabine exposure was performed using these cells. RESULTS: Both retroviral and adenoviral vector-mediated transduction of the dCK complementary DNA resulted in marked sensitization of tongue squamous carcinoma cell lines to the cytotoxic effects of cytarabine in vitro. CONCLUSION: The dCK-cytarabine system may be a useful approach for gene therapy of squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck.","['Kojima, Hiromi', 'Iida, Minoru', 'Miyazaki, Hidemi', 'Koga, Tomohiko', 'Moriyama, Hiroshi', 'Manome, Yoshinobu']","['Kojima H', 'Iida M', 'Miyazaki H', 'Koga T', 'Moriyama H', 'Manome Y']","['Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Jikei University School of Medicine, 3-25-8 Nishishinbashi Minato-ku, 105-8461 Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Arch Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,Archives of otolaryngology--head & neck surgery,8603209,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Prodrugs)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'EC 2.7.1.74 (Deoxycytidine Kinase)']",IM,"['Adenoviridae', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/*drug therapy/*enzymology/genetics', 'Cytarabine/*pharmacology', 'Deoxycytidine Kinase/*genetics', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Genetic Therapy', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Head and Neck Neoplasms/*drug therapy/*enzymology/genetics', 'Humans', 'Prodrugs/*pharmacology', 'Transduction, Genetic', '*Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/06/07 10:00,2002/07/13 10:01,['2002/06/07 10:00'],"['2002/06/07 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/07/13 10:01 [medline]', '2002/06/07 10:00 [entrez]']","['ooa10207 [pii]', '10.1001/archotol.128.6.708 [doi]']",ppublish,Arch Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg. 2002 Jun;128(6):708-13. doi: 10.1001/archotol.128.6.708.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We examined the uptake, intracellular degradation, metabolism and thymidylate synthase (TS) inhibition of MTX-HSA in the T-cell leukemia line CCRF-CEM and the MTX transport resistant clone CCRF-CEM/MTX. The number of MTX molecules per albumin molecule was determined by electrospray mass spectrometry. A loading ratio (LR) of approximately 1.4 mol MTX/albumin revealed intact complexes with one and two MTX molecules/albumin. In the complex with an LR of 5.7, albumin with up to 16 MTX molecules was seen. MTX-HSA was taken up by CCRF-CEM cells via endocytosis and cleaved by lysosomal enzymes. Liberated MTX was a poor substrate of folylpolyglutamate synthetase and was exported into the medium. TS was inhibited and cell survival was impaired by MTX-HSA in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. CCRF-CEM/MTX cells exhibited a growth inhibition of 30-40% after MTX-HSA treatment, but no TS inhibition.

T1 relaxation time at 7.0 Tesla, measured for the melanoma cell line (MM-138) and leukemia cell line (HL-60) after incubation at 37 degrees C for 4 hr, were significantly decreased (approximately 25%) relative to controls. The gadolinium concentration in cells and washing solutions was measured by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES). A linear relationship was observed between T1 relaxation rates and gadolinium concentrations obtained by ICP-AES. The ICP-AES results showed no gadolinium uptake in the non-targeted HT-29 colorectal cancer cells.","['Shahbazi-Gahrouei, D', 'Rizvi, S M', 'Williams, M A', 'Allen, B J']","['Shahbazi-Gahrouei D', 'Rizvi SM', 'Williams MA', 'Allen BJ']","['Center for Experimental Radiation Oncology, Shahrekord University of Medical Sciences, Iran.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Netherlands,Australas Phys Eng Sci Med,Australasian physical & engineering sciences in medicine,8208130,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Contrast Media)', '0 (Radiopharmaceuticals)', 'K2I13DR72L (Gadolinium DTPA)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/chemistry/*pharmacokinetics', 'Contrast Media/*pharmacokinetics', 'Gadolinium DTPA/chemistry/*pharmacokinetics', 'HL-60 Cells/metabolism', 'HT29 Cells/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging/*methods', 'Melanoma/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Radiopharmaceuticals/chemistry/*pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Time Factors']",2002/06/07 10:00,2002/08/13 10:01,['2002/06/07 10:00'],"['2002/06/07 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/13 10:01 [medline]', '2002/06/07 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF03178372 [doi]'],ppublish,Australas Phys Eng Sci Med. 2002 Mar;25(1):31-8. doi: 10.1007/BF03178372.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has recently been demonstrated that in vivo administration of IL-18 to mice results in considerable antitumor effects against syngeneic Meth A sarcoma. In this study, the antitumor effects of IL-18 against murine T-cell leukemia (EL-4) were evaluated. EL-4 proliferation was resistant in vitro to IL-18 and IFN-gamma. When 4 x 10(6) EL-4 cells were transplanted intravenously, the antitumor effects of IL-18 were not pronounced, and only a slight prolongation of the mean survival times was observed. The antitumor effects of IFN-gamma were even less apparent than those of IL-18. However, when mice were transplanted intravenously with 5 x 10(5) EL-4 cells, the extent of experimental visceral dissemination of EL-4 was markedly reduced in mice treated subcutaneously with IL-18, resulting in an increase in survival time with some mice even cured. Although IL-18 was highly effective at inhibiting the development of EL-4 lymphoma dissemination in C57BL/6 mice, it could not inhibit the development of dissemination in mutant C57BL/6 beige (bg/bg) mice lacking NK cell activity. The efficacy of IL-18 was also significantly reduced in nude mice lacking T cells. These results suggest that antitumor efficacy of IL-18 is mediated primarily by NK cells, but that T cells are also required for the complete antitumor efficacy of IL-18.","['Akamatsu, Sachiko', 'Arai, Norie', 'Hanaya, Toshiharu', 'Arai, Shigeyuki', 'Tanimoto, Tadao', 'Fujii, Mitsukiyo', 'Kohno, Keizo', 'Micallef, Mark J', 'Ikeda, Masao', 'Kurimoto, Masashi']","['Akamatsu S', 'Arai N', 'Hanaya T', 'Arai S', 'Tanimoto T', 'Fujii M', 'Kohno K', 'Micallef MJ', 'Ikeda M', 'Kurimoto M']","['Fujisaki Institute, Hayashibara Biochemical Laboratories, Inc., Okayama, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Immunother,"Journal of immunotherapy (Hagerstown, Md. : 1997)",9706083,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-18)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cytokines/drug effects/metabolism', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'Interferon-gamma/*drug effects/immunology', 'Interleukin-18/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Reference Values', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Treatment Outcome']",2002/06/06 10:00,2002/10/11 04:00,['2002/06/06 10:00'],"['2002/06/06 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/10/11 04:00 [medline]', '2002/06/06 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00002371-200203001-00005 [doi]'],ppublish,J Immunother. 2002 Mar-Apr;25 Suppl 1:S28-34. doi: 10.1097/00002371-200203001-00005.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The modest concordance rate for leukemia in identical twins ( approximately 5%), protracted latency, and transgenic modeling all suggest that additional postnatal exposure and/or genetic events are required for clinically overt leukemia development. This notion leads to the prediction that chromosome translocations, functional fusion genes, and preleukemic clones should be present in the blood of healthy newborns at a rate that is significantly greater than the cumulative risk of the corresponding leukemia. Using parallel reverse transcriptase-PCR and real-time PCR (Taqman) screening, we find that the common leukemia fusion genes, TEL-AML1 or AML1-ETO, are present in cord bloods at a frequency that is 100-fold greater than the risk of the corresponding leukemia. Single-cell analysis by cell enrichment and immunophenotype/fluorescence in situ hybridization multicolor staining confirmed the presence of translocations in restricted cell types corresponding to the B lymphoid or myeloid lineage of the leukemias that normally harbor these fusion genes. The frequency of positive cells (10(-4) to 10(-3)) indicates substantial clonal expansion of a progenitor population.

The risk of childhood leukemia was higher than expected for the distance up to 6 km from the radio station (standardized incidence rate = 2.2, 95% confidence interval: 1.0, 4.1), and there was a significant decline in risk with increasing distance both for male mortality (p = 0.03) and for childhood leukemia (p = 0.036). The study has limitations because of the small number of cases and the lack of exposure data. Although the study adds evidence of an excess of leukemia in a population living near high-power radio transmitters, no causal implication can be drawn. There is still insufficient scientific knowledge, and new epidemiologic studies are needed to clarify a possible leukemogenic effect of residential exposure to radio frequency radiation.","['Michelozzi, Paola', 'Capon, Alessandra', 'Kirchmayer, Ursula', 'Forastiere, Francesco', 'Biggeri, Annibale', 'Barca, Alessandra', 'Perucci, Carlo A']","['Michelozzi P', 'Capon A', 'Kirchmayer U', 'Forastiere F', 'Biggeri A', 'Barca A', 'Perucci CA']","['Department of Epidemiology, Local Health Authority RME, Rome, Italy. salute@asplazio.it']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Epidemiol,American journal of epidemiology,7910653,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Electromagnetic Fields/*adverse effects', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology/etiology/mortality', 'Male', 'Radio Waves/adverse effects', 'Rome/epidemiology']",2002/06/06 10:00,2002/07/12 10:01,['2002/06/06 10:00'],"['2002/06/06 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/07/12 10:01 [medline]', '2002/06/06 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/aje/155.12.1096 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Epidemiol. 2002 Jun 15;155(12):1096-103. doi: 10.1093/aje/155.12.1096.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we determined the molecular pathways that lead to apoptosis after treatment of cells with the PKC-specific inhibitor RO-31-8220. For this, we used the U937 human leukemia cell line and a phorbolmyristate acetate (PMA)-resistant derivative cell line, R-U937. Ro-31-8220 treatment of U937 cells leads to apoptosis, which is accompanied by activation of caspase 3 (as measured by decreased levels of the 32kDa inactive form and increased proteolytic cleavage of phospholipase C (PLC)-gamma1). The broad-range caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk inhibits this induction of apoptosis, supporting a direct link between caspase activation and Ro-31-8220 induction of apoptosis. This activation of apoptosis is also accompanied by release of cytochrome c, but not by altered expression of Bcl-2 family protein or IAP family proteins. In R-U937 cells, Ro-31-8220 fails to cause release of cytochrome c, activation of caspase 3, or apoptosis. Activation of Akt occurs to a greater extent in the R-U937 cells than the U937 cells and thus might be related to protection from Ro-31-8220-induced apoptosis.","['Choi, Yun-Jung', 'Park, Jong-Wook', 'Woo, Ju-Hyung', 'Kim, Young-Ho', 'Lee, Sang-Han', 'Lee, Jin-Man', 'Kwon, Taeg Kyu']","['Choi YJ', 'Park JW', 'Woo JH', 'Kim YH', 'Lee SH', 'Lee JM', 'Kwon TK']","['Department of Immunology, School of Medicine, Keimyung University, 194 DongSan-Dong Jung-Gu, 700-712, Taegu, South Korea.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Ireland,Cancer Lett,Cancer letters,7600053,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Indoles)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'W9A0B5E78O (Ro 31-8220)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cell Nucleus/drug effects/pathology', 'Drug Resistance', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Indoles/*pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase C/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*toxicity', 'U937 Cells']",2002/06/06 10:00,2002/09/18 10:01,['2002/06/06 10:00'],"['2002/06/06 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/18 10:01 [medline]', '2002/06/06 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0304383502000824 [pii]', '10.1016/s0304-3835(02)00082-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Lett. 2002 Aug 28;182(2):183-91. doi: 10.1016/s0304-3835(02)00082-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Supra-additive effects were seen in K-562 cells after concomitant and sequential exposure of Gem followed by HPC. The reverse sequence resulted in antagonism. Both effects were more significant when HPC was exchanged for ErPC(3). Gem or HPC failed to induce DNA laddering in K-562 cells, but apoptotic signals were transferred by the Gem-exposed SKW-3 cytosolic fraction to K-562 nuclei. HPC did not increase the clastogenicity of Gem and counteracted its mitotic inhibition in murine bone marrow.

The extracellular parts of both gp130 and LIFR consist of several Ig-like and fibronectin type III-like domains. The role of the membrane-distal domains of gp130 (D1, D2, D3) and LIFR in ligand binding is well established. In this study we investigated the functional significance of the membrane-proximal domains of gp130 (D4, D5, D6) in respect to heterodimerization with LIFR. Deletion of each of the membrane-proximal domains of gp130 (Delta 4, Delta 5 and Delta 6) leads to LIF unresponsiveness. Replacement of the gp130 domains by the corresponding domains of the related GCSF receptor either restores weak LIF responsiveness (D4-GCSFR), leads to constitutive activation of gp130 (D5-GCSFR) or results in an inactive receptor (D6-GCSFR). Mutation of a specific cysteine in D5 of gp130 (C458A) leads to constitutive heterodimerization with the LIFR and increased sensitivity towards LIF stimulation. Based on these findings, a functional model of the gp130-LIFR heterodimer is proposed that includes contacts between D5 of gp130 and the corresponding domain D7 of the LIFR and highlights the requirement for both receptor dimerization and adequate receptor orientation as a prerequisite for signal transduction.","['Timmermann, Andreas', 'Kuster, Andrea', 'Kurth, Ingo', 'Heinrich, Peter C', 'Muller-Newen, Gerhard']","['Timmermann A', 'Kuster A', 'Kurth I', 'Heinrich PC', 'Muller-Newen G']","['Institut fur Biochemie, Rheinisch-Westfalische Technische Hochschule Aachen, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Biochem,European journal of biochemistry,0107600,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Il6st protein, mouse)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lifr protein, mouse)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD/*chemistry/*metabolism', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130', 'Dimerization', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*chemistry/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Point Mutation', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Receptors, Cytokine/*metabolism', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Signal Transduction']",2002/06/06 10:00,2002/07/27 10:01,['2002/06/06 10:00'],"['2002/06/06 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/07/27 10:01 [medline]', '2002/06/06 10:00 [entrez]']","['2941 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1432-1033.2002.02941.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Biochem. 2002 Jun;269(11):2716-26. doi: 10.1046/j.1432-1033.2002.02941.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The probability of leukemia-free survival is 20-40%. Philadelphia-chromosome positive (BCR-ABL positive) ALL has the worse prognosis. A single centre experience with treatment of ALL in adults is reported. METHODS AND RESULTS: Between April 1997 and July 2000, 15 consecutive patients with de novo adult ALL (7 T-lineage ALL, 7 B-lineage ALL, 1 null ALL) begin their treatment with the seven-drug induction regimen (in phase I, daunorubicin, vincristine, L-asparaginase, i.v., and prednisone, p.o.; in phase II, 6-mercaptopurine, p.o., cytosine arabinoside and cyclophosphamide, i.v.) and central nervous system (CNS) prophylaxis (methotrexate and CNS irradiation in patients without total body irradiation in conditioning regimen), with intensive consolidation (three times high-dose methotrexate and high-dose-cytarabine, i.v.), and with/out autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) followed by maintenance chemotherapy (6-mercaptopurine and methotrexate, p.o.). Seven patients received autologous PBSCT. Median patient age was 30 years. Three patients were BCR-ABL positive at diagnosis. With median follow-up 14 month (range 0.1-46 month), seven (4 T-lineage ALL, 2 B-lineage ALL, 1 null ALL) out of 15 patients are alive in remission (four of them receiving autologous PBSCT). Causes of death were relapse (n = 3), chemotherapy related toxicity (n = 2), infection (n = 1), and acute myeloid leukaemia developed 10 months after autologous PBSCT (n = 1). All BCR-ABL positive patients died. CONCLUSIONS: Chemotherapy alone and autologous PBSCT with maintenance therapy may be curative for adult patients with ALL. We can recommend these treatment options for patients without risk factors in particular.","['Doubek, M', 'Mayer, J', 'Koristek, Z', 'Protivankova, M', 'Brychtova, Y', 'Oborilova, A', 'Kral, Z', 'Klabusay, M', 'Tomiska, M', 'Buchtova, I', 'Vorlicek, J']","['Doubek M', 'Mayer J', 'Koristek Z', 'Protivankova M', 'Brychtova Y', 'Oborilova A', 'Kral Z', 'Klabusay M', 'Tomiska M', 'Buchtova I', 'Vorlicek J']","['Interni hematoonkologicka klinika LF MU a FN, Brno. mdoubek@fnbrno.cz']",['cze'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Czech Republic,Cas Lek Cesk,Casopis lekaru ceskych,0004743,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/mortality/*therapy', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Rate']",2002/06/06 10:00,2002/06/21 10:01,['2002/06/06 10:00'],"['2002/06/06 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/06/21 10:01 [medline]', '2002/06/06 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cas Lek Cesk. 2002 Mar 1;141(4):122-6.,,,,,"Terapie akutni lymfoblasticke leukemie dospelych kombinaci sedmi chemoterapeutik v indukcni lecbe, intenzivni konzolidaci s autologni transplantaci kmenovych bunek krvetvorby nebo bez ni a s naslednou udrzovaci lecbou.

Primary cerebral lymphoma is a rare neoplasm uncommonly investigated in the setting of NS. We describe for the first time a case of primary cerebral lymphoma in association with MN. An elderly woman presented for renal biopsy because an NS had been diagnosed previously and treated by steroid therapy. Primary membranous glomerulonephritis was diagnosed and immunosuppressive therapy was started. Twenty days later, she was readmitted because of left hemiplegia. Computed tomography and subsequent nuclear magnetic resonance evaluation of the brain documented an extensive cerebral space-occupying lesion. A cerebral malignant lymphoma was diagnosed at intraoperative histologic evaluation, and subsequent light microscopic and immunohistochemical studies allowed the diagnosis of peripheral T-cell lymphoma. Extensive clinical workup, including bone marrow biopsy, documented the lack of any neoplastic involvement outside the brain. Primary cerebral non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of peripheral T-cell derivation consequently was diagnosed. This case suggests that patients with MN, particularly elderly patients, should undergo complete screening for neoplasms. The absence of specific guidelines on this topic may be due partly to the lack of extensive description of all newly identified cases. All cases should be reported to evaluate whether this association is causal or fortuitous.","['Strippoli, Giovanni F M', 'Manno, Carlo', 'Rossini, Michele', 'Occhiogrosso, Giuseppe', 'Maiorano, Eugenio', 'Schena, Francesco P']","['Strippoli GF', 'Manno C', 'Rossini M', 'Occhiogrosso G', 'Maiorano E', 'Schena FP']","['Department of Emergency and Organ Transplantation, Division of Nephrology, University of Bari, Bari, Italy. gfmstrippoli@katamail.com']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Am J Kidney Dis,American journal of kidney diseases : the official journal of the National Kidney Foundation,8110075,"['5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'COP protocol 2']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Brain Neoplasms/*complications/drug therapy', 'Cyclophosphamide/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Glomerulonephritis, Membranous/*complications/drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*complications/drug therapy', 'Nephrotic Syndrome/*complications/drug therapy/etiology', 'Prednisone/therapeutic use', 'Vincristine/therapeutic use']",2002/06/05 10:00,2002/06/18 10:01,['2002/06/05 10:00'],"['2002/06/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/06/18 10:01 [medline]', '2002/06/05 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0272-6386(02)55493-7 [pii]', '10.1053/ajkd.2002.33413 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Kidney Dis. 2002 Jun;39(6):E22. doi: 10.1053/ajkd.2002.33413.,,,,,,,,,"['Copyright 2002 by the National Kidney Foundation, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To report an elderly patient with a primary myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) type refractory anemia with excess of blasts (RAEB) who developed an orbital granulocytic sarcoma (GS) as a harbinger of an acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). METHODS. A 77-year-old man was diagnosed as having a MDS type RAEB. Eight months later he developed a progressive painless proptosis in his left orbit. A computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a large irregular mass involving the orbit. It showed heterogeneous soft tissue density and no osseous cortical destruction was observed. A diagnostic lateral orbitotomy with an excisional biopsy were performed. RESULTS. Histopathology showed sheets of immature granulocytic cells. Immunohistochemical staining was positive for markers for myeloperoxidase, which supported the diagnosis of GS. CONCLUSIONS. Reports of a GS complicating the course of a MDS are few. Sites of detection of the extramedullary tumors (EMT) in MDS vary, although cutaneous sites predominate. An orbital site is a very rare localization of this tumor in adults. The case we report is the first one with an orbital granulocytic sarcoma in an MDS-type RAEB in an elderly patient.","['Padillo, Dolores', 'Mencia, Enrique', 'Gutierrez, Esperanza', 'Martinez, Miguel Angel']","['Padillo D', 'Mencia E', 'Gutierrez E', 'Martinez MA']","['Department of Ophthalmology, 12 de Octubre University Hospital, Madrid, Spain']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Orbit,"Orbit (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",8301221,,,,2002/06/05 10:00,2002/06/05 10:01,['2002/06/05 10:00'],"['2002/06/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/06/05 10:01 [medline]', '2002/06/05 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1076/orbi.18.4.287.2693 [doi]'],ppublish,Orbit. 1999 Dec;18(4):287-290. doi: 10.1076/orbi.18.4.287.2693.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The pathologic diagnosis, and hence the management, of rare tumors of the orbit can represent a challenge. An increasing number of tumors have been shown to display specific chromosomal abnormalities detectable by cytogenetic analysis. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Two examples of rare primary orbital tumors are presented in which the correct pathologic diagnosis was either established or confirmed by cytogenetic analysis. Small pieces of the tumor were obtained at the time of biopsy and placed immediately, in a sterile fashion, in fresh culture medium. The cells were Giemsa stained and processed for chromosome analysis. RESULTS. In the first case, a 12-year-old boy was diagnosed with a sino-orbital mass after sustaining minor trauma. On biopsy, the pathologic examination was at first consistent with a Burkitt-like lymphoma, until cytogenetic analysis showed a t(8;21)(q22;q22) translocation, specific for granulocytic sarcoma, which corresponds to the localized solid form of acute myeloblastic leukemia. Consequently, proper chemotherapy was re-oriented and remission was achieved. In the second case, a 2-year-old boy presented with a well-vascularized orbital tumor. The histopathologic diagnosis of alveolar soft-part sarcoma of the orbit was confirmed by the finding of a specific t(X;17)(p11;q25) translocation. After two unsuccessful courses of chemotherapy, wide excision surgery with primary reconstruction brought remission. CONCLUSIONS. Cytogenetic analysis should be considered in the diagnosis of any orbital tumor which is suspected of malignancy.","['Lasudry, J', 'Heimann, P']","['Lasudry J', 'Heimann P']","['Department of Ophthalmology, Universite Libre de Bruxelles, Hopital Erasme, Brussels, Belgium']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Orbit,"Orbit (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",8301221,,,,2002/06/05 10:00,2002/06/05 10:00,['2002/06/05 10:00'],"['2002/06/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/06/05 10:00 [medline]', '2002/06/05 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Orbit. 2000 Jun;19(2):87-95.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we show that TRADD contains a nuclear export and import sequence that allow shuttling between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. In the absence of export, TRADD is found within nuclear structures that are associated with promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) nuclear bodies. In these structures, the TRADD death domain (TRADD-DD) can activate an apoptosis pathway that is mechanistically distinct from its action at the membrane-bound TNFR1 complex. Apoptosis by nuclear TRADD-DD is promyelocytic leukemia protein dependent, involves p53, and is inhibited by Bcl-xL but not by caspase inhibitors or dominant negative FADD (FADD-DN). Conversely, apoptosis induced by TRADD in the cytoplasm is resistant to Bcl-xL, but sensitive to caspase inhibitors and FADD-DN. These data indicate that nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of TRADD leads to the activation of distinct apoptosis mechanisms that connect the death receptor apparatus to nuclear events.","['Morgan, Michael', 'Thorburn, Jacqueline', 'Pandolfi, Pier Paolo', 'Thorburn, Andrew']","['Morgan M', 'Thorburn J', 'Pandolfi PP', 'Thorburn A']","['Department of Cancer Biology and Comprehensive Cancer Center, Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, NC 27157, USA.']",['eng'],['NS42662/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Cell Biol,The Journal of cell biology,0375356,"['0 (Fatty Acids, Unsaturated)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (TNF Receptor-Associated Death Domain Protein)', '0 (TNF Receptor-Associated Factor 1)', '0 (Tradd protein, mouse)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor-Associated Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'Y031I2N1EO (leptomycin B)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', 'Cytoplasm/*metabolism', 'Fatty Acids, Unsaturated/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Mice/embryology', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/*metabolism', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Signal Transduction', 'TNF Receptor-Associated Death Domain Protein', 'TNF Receptor-Associated Factor 1', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', '*Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor-Associated Peptides and Proteins', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism']",2002/06/05 10:00,2002/07/16 10:01,['2002/06/05 10:00'],"['2002/06/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/07/16 10:01 [medline]', '2002/06/05 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1083/jcb.200204039 [doi]', 'jcb.200204039 [pii]']",ppublish,J Cell Biol. 2002 Jun 10;157(6):975-84. doi: 10.1083/jcb.200204039.

The main side effect of idarubicin is free-radicals based cardiotoxicity. Using the comet assay we showed that the drug at concentrations from the range 0.001 to 10 microM induced DNA damage in normal human lymphocytes, measured as the increase in percentage of DNA in the tail (% tail DNA). The effect was dose-dependent. Treated cells were able to recover within a 120-min incubation. Recognised cell protector, amifostine at 14 mM decreased the mean % tail DNA of the cells exposed to idarubicin at all tested concentrations of the drug. So did vitamin C at 10 microM, but vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol) at 50 microM increased the % tail DNA. Lymphocytes exposed to idarubicin and treated with endonuclease III, formamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylase and 3-methyladenine-DNA glycosylase II, enzymes recognizing oxidized and alkylated bases, displayed greater extent of DNA damage than those not treated with these enzymes. Pretreatment of lymphocytes with nitrone spin traps, N-tert-butyl-alpha-phenylnitrone and alpha-(4-pyridil-1-oxide)-N-tert-butylnitrone decreased the extent of DNA damage evoked by idarubicin. To discuss the influence of vitamins and amifostine in cancer cells we used also murine pro-B lymphoid BaF3 transformed with BCR/ABL oncogene. These cells can be treated as model cells of human acute myelogenous leukemia. The response of these cells to vitamin E was quantitatively the same as human lymphocytes. However, vitamin C did not exert any effect on DNA damage and amifostine, in spite to normal lymphocytes, potentiated this effect. The results obtained suggest that reactive oxygen species, including free radicals, may be involved in the formation of DNA lesions induced by idarubicin. The drug can also methylate DNA bases. Our results indicate that not only cardiotoxicity but also genotoxicity and in consequence induction of secondary malignancies should be taken into account as diverse side effects of idarubicin. Amifostine may potentate DNA-damage effect of idarubicin in cancer cells and decrease this effect in normal cells. Vitamin C can be considered as protective agents against DNA damage in normal cells in persons receiving idarubicin-based chemotherapy, but the use of vitamin E cannot be recommended and at least needs further research.","['Blasiak, Janusz', 'Gloc, Ewa', 'Wozniak, Katarzyna', 'Mlynarski, Wojciech', 'Stolarska, Malgorzata', 'Skorski, Tomasz', 'Majsterek, Ireneusz']","['Blasiak J', 'Gloc E', 'Wozniak K', 'Mlynarski W', 'Stolarska M', 'Skorski T', 'Majsterek I']","['Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Lodz, Banacha 12/16, Poland. januszb@biol.uni.lodz.pl']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Ireland,Chem Biol Interact,Chemico-biological interactions,0227276,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Mutagens)', '0 (Vitamins)', '1406-18-4 (Vitamin E)', 'EC 3.1.- (Endodeoxyribonucleases)', 'M487QF2F4V (Amifostine)', 'PQ6CK8PD0R (Ascorbic Acid)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Amifostine/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*toxicity', 'Antioxidants/pharmacology', 'Ascorbic Acid/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Comet Assay', 'DNA Damage/drug effects', 'DNA Repair/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Endodeoxyribonucleases/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/*toxicity', 'Lymphocytes/drug effects', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mutagens/*toxicity', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vitamin E/pharmacology', 'Vitamins/*pharmacology']",2002/06/05 10:00,2002/07/31 10:01,['2002/06/05 10:00'],"['2002/06/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/07/31 10:01 [medline]', '2002/06/05 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0009279702000121 [pii]', '10.1016/s0009-2797(02)00012-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Chem Biol Interact. 2002 Apr 20;140(1):1-18. doi: 10.1016/s0009-2797(02)00012-1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Sixty five episodes of bacteremia from E. coli appearing over seven years from 12,301 admissions in a single cancer institution were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: The proportion of bacteremia caused by E. coli among Gram-negative bacteremia was 20.8% (the second most common organism after Pseudomonas aeruginosa), and infection-associated mortality was 17%. The incidence in 1989-1995 varied from 14.3 to 24.7%. The most common risk factors were: solid tumors as the underlying disease (70.7%); central venous catheter insertion (32.3%); prior surgery (46.2%), and prior chemotherapy within 48 h (44.4%). Neutropenia and urinary catheters did not place patients at high risk in any of the subgroups. When we compared the two subgroups of 61 cases of bacteremia - monomicrobial and polymicrobial (when E. coli was isolated from blood culture with another microorganism) - we found that acute leukemia and breakthrough (recurrence while receiving antibiotics) bacteremia were more frequently associated with polymicrobial E. coli bacteremia. There was also a difference in infection-associated mortality: monomicrobial bacteremia due to E. coli only had a significantly lower mortality in comparison with polymicrobial E. coli bacteremia (8.9 vs 35.0%, respectively; P<0.03). CONCLUSION: The susceptibility of 115 E. coli strains isolated from 65 episodes of bacteremia was stable. Only two episodes caused by quinolone-resistant strains occurred, both in 1995, after six years of using ofloxacin for prophylaxis in neutropenic patients in our hospital. We found that 85.2-91.3% of all strains were susceptible to aminoglycosides, 97.8% to quinolones, and 90-100% to third generation cephalosporins and imipenems. The patients most commonly infected had solid tumors and the mortality was only 17%.","['Krcmery, Vladimir', 'Spanik, Stanislav', 'Mrazova, Mariana', 'Trupl, Jan', 'Grausova, Silvia', 'Grey, Eva', 'Kukuckova, Eva', 'Sulcova, Margita', 'Krupova, Iveta', 'Koren, Pavol']","['Krcmery V', 'Spanik S', 'Mrazova M', 'Trupl J', 'Grausova S', 'Grey E', 'Kukuckova E', 'Sulcova M', 'Krupova I', 'Koren P']","['Department of Medicine, School of Public Health, University of Trnava, Slovak Repulbic.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Canada,Int J Infect Dis,International journal of infectious diseases : IJID : official publication of the International Society for Infectious Diseases,9610933,['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)'],IM,"['Anti-Bacterial Agents/pharmacology', 'Bacteremia/complications/*epidemiology/*microbiology', 'Drug Resistance, Bacterial', 'Escherichia coli/*drug effects/isolation & purification', 'Escherichia coli Infections/complications/*epidemiology/microbiology', 'Female', 'Gram-Negative Bacteria/isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Microbial Sensitivity Tests', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*complications', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors']",2002/06/05 10:00,2002/08/23 10:01,['2002/06/05 10:00'],"['2002/06/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/23 10:01 [medline]', '2002/06/05 10:00 [entrez]']","['S1201-9712(02)90140-2 [pii]', '10.1016/s1201-9712(02)90140-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Infect Dis. 2002 Mar;6(1):69-73. doi: 10.1016/s1201-9712(02)90140-2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This breakthrough has been particularly exciting for the field of sarcoma and for patients with advanced GIST, for whom no other effective therapy was available. Unfortunately, as is becoming increasingly clear, cancer is a very complex problem with multiple mechanisms and pathways that function either independently or interdependently enabling cell survival. We are therefore far away from having solved the problem. Attempts at refining the currently available therapeutic armamentarium to maximize the therapeutic index (dose intensification with growth factor support) must continue in parallel with laboratory-based research identifying critical targets to be inhibited or blocked.

METHODS: In preliminary experiments, artificial mixtures of murine and human BM cells were labeled with a combination of Abs specific for murine hematopoietic cells, prior to immunomagnetic negative selection using StemSep. In subsequent experiments, BM was harvested from individual NOD/SCID mice transplanted 6-12 weeks earlier with either human cord blood or primary CML cells and a similar immunomagnetic selection procedure was applied to enrich human cells present. RESULTS: Application of this selection procedure to mixtures of murine and human hematopoietic cells using anti-mouse CD45 and Ter-119 allowed a > 1000-fold depletion of murine cells with > 50% recovery of human cells, including progenitors. This level of depletion and recovery were found to be reproducible for NOD/SCID mice transplanted and engrafted with human cord blood stem cells, thus facilitating detection of human progenitors, including colony-forming cells (CFC) and LTCIC. For NOD/SCID mice previously transplanted with CML cells, this procedure increased the sensitivity of detecting rare human cell subsets by up to > 100-fold. This, in turn, improved the sensitivity of RT-PCR for BCR-ABL and made possible the identification by FACS of various minor subsets of human cells, including CD34(-)CD19/20(+) B-lineage cells, CD34(+) progenitors, mature CD15(+) myeloid cells and CD3(+) T cells present in the mice. DISCUSSION: This simple cell-depletion procedure should facilitate future investigations of normal and CML stem cell populations in vitro and in NOD/SCID mice.","['Holyoake, T L', 'Horrocks, C', 'Thomas, T', 'Eaves, C J', 'Eaves, A C']","['Holyoake TL', 'Horrocks C', 'Thomas T', 'Eaves CJ', 'Eaves AC']","['Academic Transfusion Medicine Unit, Department of Medicine, Royal Infirmary, Glasgow, UK.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cytotherapy,Cytotherapy,100895309,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/analysis', 'Cell Separation/*methods', 'Fetal Blood/cytology/metabolism/transplantation', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunomagnetic Separation/*methods', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia/genetics/*pathology', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens/analysis', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl/genetics', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Species Specificity']",2002/06/05 10:00,2003/01/29 04:00,['2002/06/05 10:00'],"['2002/06/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/29 04:00 [medline]', '2002/06/05 10:00 [entrez]']","['S1465-3249(00)70950-9 [pii]', '10.1080/146532400539350 [doi]']",ppublish,Cytotherapy. 2000;2(6):411-21. doi: 10.1080/146532400539350.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIAL AND METHODS: This review is based on current knowledge about the metabolism of thiopurines and the clinical implications of genetic polymorphism in thiopurine-S-methyltransferase (TPMT). RESULTS: Intracellularly thiopurines, e.g. 6-MP, are anabolized to cytotoxic 6-thioguanine nucleotides (6-TGN) that are incorporated into DNA and RNA. A competing pathway is S-methylation of 6-MP and its initial nucleotide metabolites by TPMT. In childhood acute lymphocytic leukaemia, high erythrocyte concentrations of 6-TGN correlate with the degree of leukopenia and a good prognosis, while low concentrations appear to be associated with higher risk of relapse. In most populations studied, approximately 10% have intermediate TPMT activity and 1/300 lacks TPMT activity due to one or two mutant TPMT alleles, respectively. INTERPRETATION: Phenotyping or genotyping may be used to identify patients as deficient or intermediate thiopurine metabolizers. This suggests that they should receive a profound or moderate reduction in dosage to avoid haematopoietic toxicity.","['Loennechen, Thrina', 'Lysaa, Roy Andre', 'Giverhaug, Trude', 'Sylte, Ingebrigt', 'Mathiesen, Lars-Eirik', 'Aarbakke, Jarle']","['Loennechen T', 'Lysaa RA', 'Giverhaug T', 'Sylte I', 'Mathiesen LE', 'Aarbakke J']","['Avdeling for farmakologi Institutt for farmasi, Universitetet i Tromso 9037 Troms. thrinal@farmasi.uit.no']",['nor'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Norway,Tidsskr Nor Laegeforen,"Tidsskrift for den Norske laegeforening : tidsskrift for praktisk medicin, ny raekke",0413423,"['0 (Antimetabolites)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Purines)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Methyltransferases)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antimetabolites/*administration & dosage/metabolism', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*administration & dosage/metabolism', 'Child', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*administration & dosage/metabolism', 'Methyltransferases/genetics/metabolism', '*Organ Transplantation', '*Pharmacogenetics', 'Phenotype', 'Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Purines/*administration & dosage/metabolism']",2002/06/05 10:00,2002/08/14 10:01,['2002/06/05 10:00'],"['2002/06/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/14 10:01 [medline]', '2002/06/05 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Tidsskr Nor Laegeforen. 2002 Apr 30;122(11):1107-10.,,,,,Nye styringsverktoy for tiopuriner i leukemi- og transplantasjonsbehandling.,,30,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: 25 patients were evaluable for response. 21 patients (84%) achieved complete remission, three patients (12%) achieved partial remission, and one patient had no response. At a median follow-up of 6.8 years, 24 patients (92%) were still alive. One patient died from infections four months after treatment, while the other patient died from a malignant melanoma 4.4 years after treatment. Relapse assessed by flow cytometry was diagnosed in 95% of the patients. 38% of those in complete and 67% of those in partial remission were treated by a second course of cladribine during the follow-up.

Available therapies can inhibit the inflammatory component of MS but do not suppress progressive clinical disability. An alternative approach would be to inhibit mechanisms that drive the neuropathology of MS, which often includes the death of oligodendrocytes, the cells responsible for myelinating the CNS. Identification of molecular mechanisms that mediate the stress response of oligodendrocytes to optimize their survival would serve this need. This study shows that the neurotrophic cytokine leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) directly prevents oligodendrocyte death in animal models of MS. We also demonstrate that this therapeutic effect complements endogenous LIF receptor signaling, which already serves to limit oligodendrocyte loss during immune attack.

Considerable controversy exists over its prognostic significance with currently available therapies. Differences in outcome may be explained by the differing intensities of various chemotherapy regimens, individual host responses to chemotherapy, or the hypothesis that relapsed TEL/AML1-positive leukemia represents an outgrowth of a secondary leukemia that shares a common initiating event with the first.

Gene expression profiling studies of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) have shown that this diagnostic category encompasses at least two molecularly distinct diseases, differing in differentiation stage (cell of origin), oncogenic mechanisms, and clinical outcome. Gene expression profiling revealed that the antiapoptotic NF-kappaB pathway is constitutively active in one DLBCL subgroup, termed activated B cell-like DLBCL, and subsequent studies validated NF-kappaB as a therapeutic target in this type of lymphoma. DNA microarray studies of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) have led to a gene expression-based predictor that identifies two subtypes of CLL that differ with respect to clinical course and presence of immunoglobulin gene mutations in the CLL cells. These findings underscore the value of gene expression profiling in defining subtypes within the lymphoid malignancies that are molecularly and clinically distinct and argue that this genomic technology should become an integral part of prospective clinical trials.","['Davis, R Eric', 'Staudt, Louis M']","['Davis RE', 'Staudt LM']","['Metabolism Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)']",IM,"['DNA, Neoplasm/*analysis', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma/*diagnosis/*genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', '*Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis']",2002/06/04 10:00,2002/12/10 04:00,['2002/06/04 10:00'],"['2002/06/04 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/10 04:00 [medline]', '2002/06/04 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00062752-200207000-00011 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2002 Jul;9(4):333-8. doi: 10.1097/00062752-200207000-00011.,,,,,,,24,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chromosomal translocations yield novel fusion transcription factors that in turn either activate genes critical for cell growth or repress genes important for normal cellular differentiation. Many of the fusion proteins of myeloid leukemia are aberrant transcriptional repressors and share the property of recruiting histone deacetylases (HDACs) to target genes. HDACs, by acting on chromatin and on transcription factors themselves, can modulate gene regulation. HDACs also play major roles in the function of well-characterized tumor suppressors such as p53 and Rb. Thus, HDACs are a compelling therapeutic target for cancer therapy. Several classes of HDAC inhibitors induce differentiation and cell death in myeloid and lymphoid model systems. Some of these are now in clinical trials for hematologic malignancies. The nature of HDAC function, the classes of inhibitors available, and recent experimental and clinical data will be reviewed.","['Melnick, Ari', 'Licht, Jonathan D']","['Melnick A', 'Licht JD']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Derald H.

About 30 to 35% of patients have either internal tandem duplications (ITDs) in the juxtamembrane domain or mutations in the activating loop of FLT3. FLT3 mutations occur in a broad spectrum of FAB subtypes in adult and pediatric AML and are particularly common in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). FLT3 mutations confer a poor prognosis in most retrospective studies. The consequence of either FLT3-ITD or activating loop mutations, which occur predominantly at position D835, is constitutive activation of the tyrosine kinase; FLT3 mutants confer factor-independent growth to Ba/F3 and 32D cells and activate similar transduction pathways as the native receptor in response to ligand, including the STAT, RAS/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and phosphatidylinositol 3; kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathways. Injection of FLT3-ITD transformed cells, such as Ba/F3 or 32D, into syngeneic recipient mice results in a leukemia-like syndrome, and expression in primary murine bone marrow cells in a retroviral transduction assay results in a myeloproliferative disorder. Mutations that abrogate FLT3 kinase activity result in loss of transforming properties in these assays. Further, FLT3-selective inhibitors impair transformation of primary AML cells that harbor these mutations, and also inhibit FLT3 transformed hematopoietic cell lines, and leukemias induced by activated FLT3 mutants in murine models. Collectively, these data indicate that FLT3 may be a viable therapeutic target for treatment of AML.","['Gilliland, D Gary', 'Griffin, James D']","['Gilliland DG', 'Griffin JD']","[""Brigham and Women's Hospital, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA. james_griffin@dfci.harvard.edu""]",['eng'],"['P01 CA66996/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 DK50654/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/*enzymology', 'Mutation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/metabolism', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3']",2002/06/04 10:00,2002/12/10 04:00,['2002/06/04 10:00'],"['2002/06/04 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/10 04:00 [medline]', '2002/06/04 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00062752-200207000-00003 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2002 Jul;9(4):274-81. doi: 10.1097/00062752-200207000-00003.,,,,,,,119,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Forty-three children who were in continuous first remission for a median of 5 years (range: 2-12 years) were studied. Before the leukemia was diagnosed, all children had been immunized against measles, mumps, and rubella according to the Swedish National immunization program. We analyzed levels of serum antibodies against measles and rubella by enzyme immunoassays. Avidity tests for measles antibodies were concomitantly performed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for measles virus immunoglobulin G detection. The proportion of plasma cells in bone marrow was studied by flow cytometry at different times during treatment and follow-up. Children who lacked protective levels of antibodies to vaccination antigens were reimmunized. Serum was collected 3 months after immunization to assess vaccination responses. RESULTS: After completion of the treatment, only 26 of the 43 children (60%) were found to be immune against measles and 31 (72%) against rubella. The proportion of bone marrow plasma cells decreased during treatment but returned to normal after 6 months. Revaccination caused both primary and secondary immune responses. Six of the 14 children without immunity failed to achieve protective levels of specific antibodies against measles and 3 against rubella. CONCLUSIONS: Our finding of loss of antibodies against measles and rubella in children treated with intensive chemotherapy suggests that reimmunization of these patients is necessary after completion of the treatment. To determine reimmunization schedules for children treated with chemotherapy, vaccination responses need to be studied further.","['Nilsson, Anna', 'De Milito, Angelo', 'Engstrom, Par', 'Nordin, Margareta', 'Narita, Mitsuo', 'Grillner, Lena', 'Chiodi, Francesca', 'Bjork, Olle']","['Nilsson A', 'De Milito A', 'Engstrom P', 'Nordin M', 'Narita M', 'Grillner L', 'Chiodi F', 'Bjork O']","['Pediatric Cancer Research Unit, Astrid Lindgren Children Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden. anna.nilsson@mtc.ki.se']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Pediatrics,Pediatrics,0376422,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Measles-Mumps-Rubella Vaccine)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antibodies, Viral/blood', 'Antibody Formation/*immunology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Cells/immunology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Immunization Schedule', 'Immunization, Secondary', 'Immunocompromised Host/immunology', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Measles/immunology/prevention & control', 'Measles virus/immunology', 'Measles-Mumps-Rubella Vaccine/administration & dosage', 'Plasma Cells/immunology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Rubella/immunology/prevention & control', 'Rubella virus/immunology']",2002/06/04 10:00,2002/07/16 10:01,['2002/06/04 10:00'],"['2002/06/04 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/07/16 10:01 [medline]', '2002/06/04 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1542/peds.109.6.e91 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatrics. 2002 Jun;109(6):e91. doi: 10.1542/peds.109.6.e91.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast, the frequency of CAFC was comparable both between patient groups (mean 1.47, range 0.15-6.33 per 10(4) MNC for AML versus mean 1.47, range 0.53-3.57 per 10(4) MNC for NHL) and compared with that of eight normal donors (mean 1.12, range 0.73-1.73 per 10(4) MNC). An inverse relationship was observed between the total CAFC number in the grafts and the hematopoietic reconstitution of both granulocytes > or = 2.0 x 10(9)/L and thrombocytes > or = 50 x 10(9)/L, in which the level of 9.0 x 10(3) CAFC/kg implied a prompt engraftment for both patient groups. Whereas the stromal cell outgrowth in vitro from 8/10 NHL patients was similar to that of six normal donors, only a few stromal cells appeared in the majority of nine evaluable AML patients. DISCUSSION: A decreased total CAFC content, as well as an inferior stromal-cell function, may be critical elements for prolonged hematopoietic reconstitution in AML.","['Olesen, G', 'Tonder, H', 'Hokland, P']","['Olesen G', 'Tonder H', 'Hokland P']","['Department of Hematology, Aarhus University Hospital, Opgang 4A, DK 8000 Aarhus C, Denmark.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cytotherapy,Cytotherapy,100895309,['9004-67-5 (Methylcellulose)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Blood Platelets/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cell Division', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/*therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/blood/therapy', 'Methylcellulose/pharmacology', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutrophils/metabolism', 'Stromal Cells/*cytology', 'Time Factors']",2002/06/04 10:00,2002/08/14 10:01,['2002/06/04 10:00'],"['2002/06/04 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/14 10:01 [medline]', '2002/06/04 10:00 [entrez]']","['S1465-3249(00)70931-5 [pii]', '10.1080/146532400539161 [doi]']",ppublish,Cytotherapy. 2000;2(3):201-9. doi: 10.1080/146532400539161.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Lack of T lymphocytes after treatment of B lymphocyte CLL (B-CLL) makes the patients susceptible to serious infections and may limit the benefit of the therapy. The aim of the study was to purify and culture-expand normal T lymphocytes from B-CLL patients prior to therapy. These cells could be frozen and given to the patients in the lymphopenic period post-chemotherapy. METHODS: T lymphocytes were isolated from the mononuclear cell apheresis products from five patients with previously untreated B-CLL. The apheresis products were red-cell depleted by density gradient centrifugation. B-lymphocyte purging was performed by incubating with MAbs to four different B-cell epitopes, followed by magnetic-bead depletion. One round of negative selection removed >90% of the B lymphocytes. The T-lymphocyte enriched cell suspension was cultured for 10/11 days in the presence of IL-2 and the anti-T cell receptor Ab OKT3. In addition, in some cultures anti-CD22 ricin immunotoxin was added. RESULTS: T cells from CLL patients expanded 4.7-21-fold over a 10/11 days culture interval. After culture, CLL cells could no longer be identified by flow cytometric evaluation. The cultured T lymphocytes were predominantly CD8(+), and were capable of lysing autologous CLL cells through a fas-dependent mechanism. DISCUSSION: Selection and expansion of T lymphocytes by this method may represent a strategy for enhancing immunity in the lymphopenic period following CLL treatment.","['Husebekk, A', 'Fellowes, V', 'Read, E J', 'Williams, J', 'Petrus, M J', 'Gress, R E', 'Fowler, D H']","['Husebekk A', 'Fellowes V', 'Read EJ', 'Williams J', 'Petrus MJ', 'Gress RE', 'Fowler DH']","['Department of Transfusion Medicine, Clinical Center, National Cancer Institute/NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cytotherapy,Cytotherapy,100895309,"['0 (Epitopes)', '0R0008Q3JB (Chromium)']",IM,"['CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromium/metabolism', 'Epitopes', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/*immunology/*therapy', 'Male', 'T-Lymphocytes/*cytology/*physiology', 'Time Factors']",2002/06/04 10:00,2002/08/14 10:01,['2002/06/04 10:00'],"['2002/06/04 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/14 10:01 [medline]', '2002/06/04 10:00 [entrez]']","['S1465-3249(00)70929-7 [pii]', '10.1080/146532400539143 [doi]']",ppublish,Cytotherapy. 2000;2(3):187-93. doi: 10.1080/146532400539143.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The environmental toxicants to which an individual is exposed are biotransformed and eliminated from the body after metabolic conversion mediated by Phase I and Phase II xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes. Phase I enzymes catalyze hydroxylation, reduction and oxidation reactions of xenobiotics (carcinogens/drugs), often converting them into more active or toxic compounds. Phase II enzymes catalyze conjugation reactions (glucuronidation, acetylation, methylation), thereby converting the metabolites into non-reactive, water-soluble products that are eliminated from the organism. The genetic polymorphism underlying the variation in enzyme activity can modify susceptibility to diverse adult cancers, probably by influencing the activation and removal of toxicants or drugs. Here we present an overview of the role of genetic variants of certain Phase I and Phase II enzymes in the development of childhood ALL, a good model for such studies because of its short latency period. The genetic contribution to the development of ALL is examined by association studies that analyze the loci of Phase I enzymes (cytochrome P-450, myeloperoxidase) and Phase II enzymes (quinone-oxidoreductase, glutathione-S-transferase, N-acetyltransferase). The loci of the enzyme variants CYPlA1, CYP2E1, NQO1, GSTM1, GSTP1, NAT2 are associated with disease development, and evidence of gene-gene interactions has emerged as well. Despite the improvements in treatment, resistant cases of ALL remain a leading cause of cancer-related death in children. Although the underlying mechanism of drug resistance is not well understood, differences in the capacity of ALL patients to process drugs and environmental carcinogens could play a role by modifying the risk of recurrent malignancy, as well as the response to therapy. Therefore, polymorphic genes encoding carcinogen- and drug-metabolizing enzymes may not only increase the risk of ALL but also influence the risk of relapse in patients. We found that the prognosis of patients with CYPlA1 and NQO1 variants was worse than that of patients who lack these variants. We conclude that genotyping ALL patients for functional polymorphisms of candidate genes can become an important tool in predicting disease outcome.","['Krajinovic, M', 'Labuda, D', 'Sinnett, D']","['Krajinovic M', 'Labuda D', 'Sinnett D']","['Hopital Sainte-Justine, Departement de Pediatrie, Universite de Montreal, Canada. maja.krajinovic@umontreal.ca']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Germany,Rev Environ Health,Reviews on environmental health,0425754,['0 (Carcinogens)'],IM,"['Carcinogens/adverse effects/metabolism', 'Child', 'Drug Resistance', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/enzymology/*genetics/pathology', '*Treatment Outcome']",2002/06/04 10:00,2002/06/18 10:01,['2002/06/04 10:00'],"['2002/06/04 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/06/18 10:01 [medline]', '2002/06/04 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1515/reveh.2001.16.4.263 [doi]'],ppublish,Rev Environ Health. 2001 Jul-Sep;16(4):263-79. doi: 10.1515/reveh.2001.16.4.263.,,,,,,,92,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the mechanism of action is unclear at present. The signaling transduction induced by PF4 in the HEL was compared with that induced by transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta1), which is also a potent inhibitor of HEL growth. It was found that PF4 had no inhibitory effect on intracellular calcium levels in resting HEL cells. When HEL cells were stimulated with interleukin-3 (IL-3), a rapid increase in the intracellular level of free calcium occurred within 15 to 20 seconds, and this increase was followed by a sustained increase that gradually declined until resting levels were reached 30 to 40 minutes later. PF4 dramatically decreased the transient rise of [Ca2+] and protein kinase C (PKC) activity of HEL cells induced by IL-3. However, PF4 had no inhibitory effect on PKC activation in resting HEL cells. Furthermore, PF4 was found to down-regulate significantly protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) activity. In contrast, TGF-beta1 induced an increase in intracellular free calcium concentration and PKC and PTK activity in HEL cells. Furthermore, PF4 significantly increased the messenger RNA (mRNA) level of p21waf1 in HEL cells. These data demonstrate that PF4 acts on HEL cells through a signaling transduction pathway, which is different from that of TGF-beta1 and is related to the up-regulatory mRNA level of p21waf1 in HEL cells.","['Liu, Yong Jun', 'Lu, Shi Hong', 'Han, Zhong Chao']","['Liu YJ', 'Lu SH', 'Han ZC']","[""National Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (TGFB1 protein, human)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta1)', '37270-94-3 (Platelet Factor 4)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Calcium/metabolism', 'Calcium Signaling/drug effects', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'Cyclins/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*pathology', 'Platelet Factor 4/*pharmacology/physiology', 'Protein Kinase C/drug effects/metabolism', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/drug effects/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/pharmacology/physiology', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta1', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",2002/06/04 10:00,2003/07/12 05:00,['2002/06/04 10:00'],"['2002/06/04 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/12 05:00 [medline]', '2002/06/04 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF02982132 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2002 May;75(4):401-6. doi: 10.1007/BF02982132.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The gemtuzumab ozogamicin group consisted of 104 patients treated in 15 U.S. and 25 European centers for first relapse of AML between May 1997 and December 1998. Conventional chemotherapy recipients consisted of 22 historical control patients who received treatment for their first occurrence of AML at a Boston teaching hospital between January 1991 and December 1994 and who subsequently underwent conventional inpatient reinduction chemotherapy for relapse. Patients in the gemtuzumab ozogamicin group received a two-hour i.v. infusion of 9 mg/m2 for up to three doses with at least two weeks between doses, while the historical controls received conventional chemotherapy, usually consisting of continuous-infusion cytarabine (days 1-7) plus mitoxantrone. Outcomes evaluated included differences in survival and hospitalization (occurrence and duration) for up to six weeks. Both stratified and multivariate regression methods were used in making comparisons. Adjusting for baseline differences, six-week survival rates were similar in the two groups (95% for the historical control group versus 89% for the gemtuzumab ozogamicin group). However, gemtuzumab ozogamicin recipients had significantly fewer total hospital days (adjusted mean, 19 days, versus 35 days), which was consistent with the higher prevalence of outpatient chemotherapy in this group (43% versus 0% among the historical controls). The difference in the number of hospital days was consistent across various baseline and demographic factors. Gemtuzumab ozogamicin appeared to be associated with equivalent survival and fewer total days of hospitalization than conventional chemotherapy in adults with relapsed AML.","['Lang, Kathleen', 'Menzin, Joseph', 'Earle, Craig C', 'Mallick, Rajiv']","['Lang K', 'Menzin J', 'Earle CC', 'Mallick R']","['Boston Health Economics, Inc., 20 Fox Road, Waltham, MA 02451, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Am J Health Syst Pharm,American journal of health-system pharmacy : AJHP : official journal of the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists,9503023,"['0 (Aminoglycosides)', '0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '93NS566KF7 (Gemtuzumab)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Aminoglycosides', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Gemtuzumab', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Length of Stay', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitoxantrone/administration & dosage', 'Treatment Outcome']",2002/06/04 10:00,2002/11/28 04:00,['2002/06/04 10:00'],"['2002/06/04 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/11/28 04:00 [medline]', '2002/06/04 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/ajhp/59.10.941 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Health Syst Pharm. 2002 May 15;59(10):941-8. doi: 10.1093/ajhp/59.10.941.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This has allowed therapeutic approaches to be developed in which T cells mediating graft-versus-host disease after bone marrow transplantation can be selectively eliminated by the administration of ganciclovir. Although the strategy has been shown to be generally successful in early clinical trials, there are concerns about possible resistance to ganciclovir and the risk of myelosuppressive side-effects at the doses required to induce T cell suicide. We have incorporated the enhanced mutant HSV-TKSR39 into retroviral vectors tailored to exhibit high levels of expression in T cells and have used protocols optimized for the transduction and selection of primary lymphocytes. We demonstrate that leukemic and primary T cells can be efficiently transduced and highly enriched under conditions that should be readily adaptable for clinical use.

To study IL-6 signal transduction in multiple myeloma (MM), we employed chimeric receptors composed of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) extracellular domain, gp130 transmembrane domain, and full-length or truncated gp130 cytoplasmic domains lacking regions previously shown to be necessary for MAPK, STAT1, and STAT3 activation. The IL-6-dependent KAS-6/1 MM cell line was transfected with various chimeric receptor constructs and assayed for EGF responsiveness. EGF stimulation surprisingly stimulated DNA synthesis in all transfectants, regardless of receptor length. When cell proliferation was assayed instead, only transfectants capable of inducing high levels of STAT3 activation proliferated in response to EGF. Additional studies revealed that EGF stimulation resulted in tyrosine phosphorylation of endogenous gp130 in cells expressing the chimeric receptor. Replacing the gp130 transmembrane region with the EGFR transmembrane domain diminished but did not disrupt this interaction. This receptor interaction was also observed in the IL-6-dependent MM cell line ANBL-6. In summary, although our results suggest that STAT activation is crucial in gp130-mediated proliferation of myeloma cells, these results must be interpreted with caution given our demonstration of the interaction between chimeric and endogenous receptors in myeloma cells. Importantly, this interaction has not been noted in studies utilizing the same gp130 chimeric receptor system in non-MM cells.","['French, J D', 'Tschumper, R C', 'Jelinek, D F']","['French JD', 'Tschumper RC', 'Jelinek DF']","['Dept of Immunology, Mayo Graduate and Medical Schools, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905, USA.']",['eng'],['CA62242/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)', '62229-50-9 (Epidermal Growth Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antigens, CD/*analysis/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Epidermal Growth Factor/pharmacology', 'ErbB Receptors/genetics/metabolism', 'Interleukin-6/*pharmacology', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*analysis/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Multiple Myeloma/*metabolism/pathology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/analysis/chemistry/metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Signal Transduction', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/06/01 10:00,2002/06/25 10:01,['2002/06/01 10:00'],"['2001/09/07 00:00 [received]', '2002/02/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/06/01 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/06/25 10:01 [medline]', '2002/06/01 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402516 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2002 Jun;16(6):1189-96. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402516.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Terminal differentiated B cells cell cycle arrest and death follows. In contrast, IL-6 acts as a growth factor for malignant myeloma plasma cells and in some cases protects them from therapeutic treatment. In this study, we examined two cell lines that show different responses to IL-6. Lymphoblastoid CESS cells respond to IL-6 by terminally differentiating into antibody producing plasma cells, cell cycle arrest, and undergo cell death. Continuous addition of IL-6 to these cells induces transient activation of STAT3, SHP-2 phosphorylation, and does not alter bcl-X(L) and c-myc expression. In contrast, the myeloma line ANBL6 proliferates when stimulated with IL-6 and this correlates with prolonged STAT3 activation and up-regulation of bcl-X(L) and c-myc. Interestingly, gp130-associated SHP-2 phosphorylation was detected in the IL-6-induced CESS cells but not myeloma cell lines. The data show a very distinct IL-6 signal transduction and kinetics in these cell lines and the distinct molecular events correlate closely to the cell fate of the lymphoblast and myeloma cell lines.","['Cheung, W-C', 'Van Ness, B']","['Cheung WC', 'Van Ness B']","['Department of Biochemistry, Molecular Biology and Biophysics, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA.']",['eng'],"['CA21115/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA62242/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-6)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Interleukin-6/*pharmacology', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Kinetics', 'Multiple Myeloma/*metabolism/pathology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Interleukin-6/analysis/metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', '*Signal Transduction', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Up-Regulation', 'bcl-X Protein']",2002/06/01 10:00,2002/06/25 10:01,['2002/06/01 10:00'],"['2001/07/23 00:00 [received]', '2001/12/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/06/01 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/06/25 10:01 [medline]', '2002/06/01 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402481 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2002 Jun;16(6):1182-8. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402481.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, qualitative RT-PCR studies of MRD have so far produced conflicting results and seem of limited prognostic value. We have evaluated retrospectively MRD in a large series of CBFbeta/MYH11-positive patients employing both qualitative and quantitative (real-time PCR) approaches. 186 bone marrow samples from 36 patients were examined with a median follow-up of 27.5 months; 15 patients relapsed during follow-up. In qualitative studies, carried out by 'nested' RT-PCR assay, all patients in complete remission (CR) immediately after induction/consolidation therapy were found to be PCR positive. However, follow-up samples at later time points were persistently negative (except one case) in patients remaining in continuous CR (CCR) for more than 12 months. 16 patients were evaluated by quantitative real-time PCR assay: CBFbeta/MYH11 transcript copy number was normalized for expression of the housekeeping gene ABL, expressed as fusion gene copy number per 10(4) copies of ABL. A 2-3 log decline in leukemic transcript copy number was observed after induction/consolidation therapy. After achieving CR, the mean copy number was significantly higher in patients destined to relapse compared to patients remaining in CCR (151 vs 9, P < 0.0001 by Mann-Whitney test). Moreover, in CCR patients, the copy number dropped below the detection threshold after the treatment protocol was completed and remained undetectable in subsequent MRD analysis in accordance with results obtained by qualitative RT-PCR. On the contrary, in the seven patients who relapsed, the copy number in CR never declined below the detection threshold; thus a cut-off value discriminating these two groups of patients could be established. The findings of our study, if confirmed, might confer an important predictive value to quantitative real-time PCR determinations of MRD in patients with inv(16) leukemia.","['Guerrasio, A', 'Pilatrino, C', 'De Micheli, D', 'Cilloni, D', 'Serra, A', 'Gottardi, E', 'Parziale, A', 'Marmont, F', 'Diverio, D', 'Divona, M', 'Lo Coco, F', 'Saglio, G']","['Guerrasio A', 'Pilatrino C', 'De Micheli D', 'Cilloni D', 'Serra A', 'Gottardi E', 'Parziale A', 'Marmont F', 'Diverio D', 'Divona M', 'Lo Coco F', 'Saglio G']","['Dipartimento di Scienze Cliniche e Biologiche, Universita di Torino, Orbassano, Torino, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Comparative Study', 'Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (CBFbeta-MYH11 fusion protein)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*analysis/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/genetics/*therapy', 'RNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', '*Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Treatment Outcome']",2002/06/01 10:00,2002/06/25 10:01,['2002/06/01 10:00'],"['2001/08/23 00:00 [received]', '2002/01/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/06/01 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/06/25 10:01 [medline]', '2002/06/01 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402478 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2002 Jun;16(6):1176-81. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402478.,,,,['Leukemia. 2003 Mar;17(3):650-1; author reply 651-2.

The detection limit of the method, assessed using serial dilutions of ALL/MIK cells, was found to be 1:10(5), similar to what is observed for the conventional RT-nested PCR method. The e1a2 BCR-ABL values were normalized with respect to those of the housekeeping gene GAPDH. The decrease in the e1a2 BCR-ABL/GAPDH ratio after remission induction chemotherapy reflects well the response to chemotherapy and consequently correlates with the prognosis. Although molecular remission was achieved by chemotherapy alone, some patients relapsed, and the e1a2 BCR-ABL/GAPDH ratios in these cases progressively increased to the levels seen prior to hematological relapse. Long-term hematological complete remission (more than 30 months) could be achieved in cases in which a more than 4.0 log decrease in the e1a2 BCR-ABL/GAPDH ratio was obtained by chemotherapy alone, and BMT was then performed. In conclusion, real-time RT-PCR allows for an evaluation of the kinetics of e1a2 BCR-ABL/GAPDH expression during the various phases of chemotherapy or after BMT and may be effective for the indication and control of disease relapse in Ph-positive ALL patients.","['Yokota, H', 'Tsuno, N H', 'Tanaka, Y', 'Fukui, T', 'Kitamura, K', 'Hirai, H', 'Osumi, K', 'Itou, N', 'Satoh, H', 'Okabe, M', 'Nakahara, K']","['Yokota H', 'Tsuno NH', 'Tanaka Y', 'Fukui T', 'Kitamura K', 'Hirai H', 'Osumi K', 'Itou N', 'Satoh H', 'Okabe M', 'Nakahara K']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', 'EC 1.2.1.- (Glyceraldehyde-3-Phosphate Dehydrogenases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*analysis/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Glyceraldehyde-3-Phosphate Dehydrogenases/biosynthesis/genetics', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/genetics/*therapy', 'RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Reference Standards', 'Remission Induction', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Retrospective Studies', '*Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/standards', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/06/01 10:00,2002/06/25 10:01,['2002/06/01 10:00'],"['2000/11/30 00:00 [received]', '2002/01/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/06/01 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/06/25 10:01 [medline]', '2002/06/01 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402483 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2002 Jun;16(6):1167-75. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402483.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

First, we examined murine FL5.12 cells transfected with the bcr-abl constructs p185, p210 and p230 and found that the transfected cells secreted as much as four-fold more VEGF (p185 > p210 >p230) than wild-type (wt) cells, as well as MMP-9 and MMP-2. When Matrigel fragments containing these bcr-abl+ cells were implanted subcutaneously in SCID or Balb-C mice they became significantly more vascularized and hemoglobinized than implants containing normal or wt cells (p185 > p210 > p230). Similarly, we found that myeloblasts expanded from bone marrow (BM) CD34+ cells derived from Philadelphia-positive CML patients secreted up to 10 times more VEGF, FGF-2, HGF and IL-8 compared to myeloblasts derived from normal donors' BM CD34+ cells and that BM mononuclear cells (MNC) isolated from CML patients induced vascularization of Matrigel implants in mice. Moreover, we found that peripheral blood MNC expressed MMP-2 and membrane-type (MT)1-MMP in about 50% of CML patients studied, and MMP-9 in all of them. Furthermore, VEGF stimulated the secretion of MMP-9 in these primary CML cells. We conclude that stimulation of angiogenesis by angiogenic factors, including MMPs, could play an important role in the pathogenesis of CML, suggesting that therapies targeting the newly formed endothelium could be developed for CML.","['Janowska-Wieczorek, A', 'Majka, M', 'Marquez-Curtis, L', 'Wertheim, J A', 'Turner, A R', 'Ratajczak, M Z']","['Janowska-Wieczorek A', 'Majka M', 'Marquez-Curtis L', 'Wertheim JA', 'Turner AR', 'Ratajczak MZ']","['Department of Medicine, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.']",['eng'],['R01 HL61796-01/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Angiogenesis Inducing Agents)', '0 (Drug Combinations)', '0 (Endothelial Growth Factors)', '0 (Laminin)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Proteoglycans)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinases)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors)', '119978-18-6 (matrigel)', '9007-34-5 (Collagen)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (Matrix Metalloproteinases)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Angiogenesis Inducing Agents/*biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Collagen/administration & dosage', 'Drug Combinations', 'Endothelial Growth Factors/metabolism', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*analysis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Laminin/administration & dosage', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/enzymology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphokines/metabolism', 'Male', 'Matrix Metalloproteinases/*biosynthesis/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, SCID', 'Middle Aged', '*Neovascularization, Pathologic', 'Proteoglycans/administration & dosage', 'RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinases/biosynthesis/genetics/metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors']",2002/06/01 10:00,2002/06/25 10:01,['2002/06/01 10:00'],"['2001/09/03 00:00 [received]', '2002/01/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/06/01 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/06/25 10:01 [medline]', '2002/06/01 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402486 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2002 Jun;16(6):1160-6. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402486.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

STI571 inhibits the BCR-ABL kinase activity, the growth and the viability of BCR-ABL expressing cells. In this study, we report the apoptotic effect of STI571 in combination with daunorubicin (DNR) on peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 11 CML patients and four BCR-ABL-positive cell lines: AR230, LAMA84, K562 and KCL22. Primary blast cells were identified by flow cytometry on the basis of their low CD45 expression. Nucleus fragmentation, exposure of phosphatidylserines and decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential were measured using acridine orange, FITC-annexin V and DiOC6(3), respectively, to evaluate apoptosis. On cell lines, the effect of DNR was negligible, whereas STI571 induced 10 to 35% of apoptosis in 18 h. STI571 sensitized AR230, LAMA84 and K562 cells to DNR when apoptosis was measured at the mitochondrial and membrane but not the nuclear levels. On CML blast cells, phosphatidyl serine exposure was significantly induced by both DNR and STI571 and was higher when these drugs were used in combination (P < 0.0003). However, the effects of this drug combination were only additive and no sensitization of blast cells to DNR by STI571 was observed. Interestingly, sensitization was evidenced in CML but not normal lymphocytes. These results suggest that other mechanisms additional to Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase activity could be responsible for DNR resistance, and further investigations are needed to understand its origin.","['Tabrizi, R', 'Mahon, F X', 'Cony Makhoul, P', 'Lagarde, V', 'Lacombe, F', 'Berthaud, P', 'Melo, J V', 'Reiffers, J', 'Belloc, F']","['Tabrizi R', 'Mahon FX', 'Cony Makhoul P', 'Lagarde V', 'Lacombe F', 'Berthaud P', 'Melo JV', 'Reiffers J', 'Belloc F']","[""Laboratoire d'Hematologie, Hopital Haut Leveque, Pessac, France.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Phosphatidylserines)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Nucleus/ultrastructure', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'Daunorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/enzymology/pathology', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/physiology', 'Phosphatidylserines/analysis', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/06/01 10:00,2002/06/25 10:01,['2002/06/01 10:00'],"['2001/07/25 00:00 [received]', '2002/02/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/06/01 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/06/25 10:01 [medline]', '2002/06/01 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402498 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2002 Jun;16(6):1154-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402498.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Transcription of the MPO gene is turned on early during the myeloblast stage of myeloid differentiation and is turned off when myeloid precursors are induced to differentiate along any one of a number of pathways. MPO transcripts show heterogeneity in size and sequence due, in part, to differential RNA splicing. We recently reported transfection studies which showed the presence of three distinct MPO promoters in the 5'-flanking region of the human MPO gene, suggesting that MPO transcription may also be regulated through the use of multiple promoters. We now report results of primer extension and RT-PCR experiments designed to determine if transcription of the human MPO gene is initiated at multiple promoter sites in vivo. MPO RNA obtained from myeloid cell lines was analyzed by primer extension using primers located at various sites between bp -1100 and bp +120 of the MPO gene. In addition, RT-PCR experiments were carried out using primer pairs located at intervals between bp -1000 and bp +2500 of the MPO gene. MPO transcripts were found to be initiated at three sites located about bp -920, bp -310, and bp +1 of the MPO gene, corresponding closely to our previously described P3, P2 and P1 promoters, respectively. Transcription initiated at the P1 site gave rise to large transcripts and showed the expected downregulation following induction of differentiation. On the other hand, transcripts initiated at the P3 and P2 sites did not show downregulation following induction of macrophage differentiation by TPA, and most did not appear to extend into the MPO coding region. Northern blot analysis of transcripts initiated at the P3 and P2 sites suggested that transcription at these sites was non-tissue-specific and indicated that many of these transcripts undergo premature termination. These results demonstrate that the MPO gene is transcribed in vivo primarily using the P1 promoter and that the low level of transcription occurring at the P2 and P3 sites is nonspecific and does not contribute significantly to physiologic regulation of MPO gene expression.","['Lin, K M', 'Austin, G E']","['Lin KM', 'Austin GE']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Decatur, GA 30033, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 1.11.1.7 (Peroxidase)']",IM,"[""5' Flanking Region"", '*Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'HL-60 Cells', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/*enzymology/*genetics', 'Myeloid Cells/enzymology', 'Peroxidase/biosynthesis/*genetics', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Terminator Regions, Genetic', 'Transcription Initiation Site']",2002/06/01 10:00,2002/06/25 10:01,['2002/06/01 10:00'],"['2001/08/29 00:00 [received]', '2002/02/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/06/01 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/06/25 10:01 [medline]', '2002/06/01 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402514 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2002 Jun;16(6):1143-53. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402514.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A parallel analysis of 42 adult B-ALL failed to detect any AML1 rearrangement by FISH. The two patients with AML1 amplification were further analyzed using molecular techniques. SSCP analysis did not detect any mutation. Furthermore, direct sequencing of the cDNA did not reveal any mutation.

A high WBC at diagnosis, which has traditionally been a predictor of poor response in T-ALL, has considerably weakened prognostic significance in the face of modern, more intensive chemotherapy. To test the hypothesis that bone marrow stroma-supported leukemic cell recovery might identify children at high risk for relapse, we measured the ex vivo recovery of T-ALL lymphoblasts from 29 newly diagnosed patients using a stromal cell co-culture assay. In all cases the T-ALL lymphoblasts showed an increase in recovery of T-ALL cells (RTC), ranging from 4 to 343%, in comparison to samples maintained without stroma. Since we were blinded to patient outcome in this case-control study, we then correlated patient outcome with RTC. The RTC for 18 patients in complete continuous remission (CCR) for greater than 4 years was stochastically larger than for the 11 patients who eventually relapsed (P = 0.011, by the two-sided Wilcoxon test). Furthermore, 100% of patients with an RTC of more than 26% had a CCR greater than 4 years while 78% of the patients with an RTC of less than 25% relapsed within 4 years.

The ability of telomerase to synthesize new DNA at telomeres suggests that this enzyme might function in the repair of double-stranded DNA breaks.

Large (three- to seven-fold) upregulation of telomerase activity occurred soon after etoposide treatment (3 h) in S/G2/M-arresting populations; this upregulation was abolished at onset of apoptotic cell death. No upregulation of telomerase activity was observed in cells treated with a larger dose of etoposide (5 microM) that caused cells to undergo rapid apoptosis without intervening cell cycle arrests. These observations are consistent with a possible role for telomerase upregulation during the DNA damage response.","['Moriarty, T J', 'Dupuis, S', 'Autexier, C']","['Moriarty TJ', 'Dupuis S', 'Autexier C']","['Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],['54638/Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/administration & dosage/pharmacology/*toxicity', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Nucleus/ultrastructure', '*DNA Damage', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics/ultrastructure', 'Diploidy', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage/pharmacology/*toxicity', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Telomerase/*metabolism', 'Up-Regulation']",2002/06/01 10:00,2002/06/25 10:01,['2002/06/01 10:00'],"['2001/07/30 00:00 [received]', '2002/02/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/06/01 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/06/25 10:01 [medline]', '2002/06/01 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402522 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2002 Jun;16(6):1112-20. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402522.,,,PMC5235897,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['CAMS2465'],,,

However, patients with a potential for cure are at risk of severe acute and late adverse effects of treatment. Furthermore, in 25-30% of patients treatment still fails. The objectives of the DCLSG study ALL 8 were to decrease the toxicity and to increase the effectivity of BFM-oriented treatment. Decrease of toxicity was aimed at by confirmation of the results of the previous DCLSG study ALL-7, showing that the majority (94%) of children with ALL can successfully be treated with BFM-oriented therapy without cranial irradiation, and by reduction of treatment for standard risk (SRG) patients. To increase the cure rate in medium risk (MRG) patients the efficacy of high doses of intravenous 6-mercaptopurine (HD-6MP) during protocol M and in SRG patients the efficacy of high doses of L-asparaginase (HD-L-ASP) during maintenance treatment was studied in randomized studies. Patient stratification and treatment were identical to protocol ALL-BFM90, with the following differences: no prophylactic cranial irradiation, SRG patients received only phase 1 of protocol I. Four hundred and sixty-seven patients entered the protocol: 170 SRG, 241 MRG and 56 HRG patients. The 5 years event-free survival rate for all patients was 73% (s.e. 2%); for SRG, MRG and HRG patients 85% (s.e. 3%), 73% (s.e. 3%) and 39% (s.e. 7%), respectively. In patients >1 year of age at diagnosis unfavorable prognostic factors were male sex, >25% blasts in the bone marrow at day 15 and initial white blood cell count (WBC) >50 x 10(9)/l. The cumulative risk of CNS relapse rate was 5% (s.e. 1%) at 5 years. These results confirm that the omission of cranial irradiation in BFM-oriented treatment does not jeopardize the overall good treatment results, nor does early reduction of chemotherapy in SRG patients. No benefit was observed from treatment intensification with HD-L-ASP in SRG patients, nor from HD-6MP in MRG patients.","['Kamps, W A', 'Bokkerink, J P M', 'Hakvoort-Cammel, F G A J', 'Veerman, A J P', 'Weening, R S', 'van Wering, E R', 'van Weerden, J F', 'Hermans, J', 'Slater, R', 'van den Berg, E', 'Kroes, W G', 'van der Does-van den Berg, A']","['Kamps WA', 'Bokkerink JP', 'Hakvoort-Cammel FG', 'Veerman AJ', 'Weening RS', 'van Wering ER', 'van Weerden JF', 'Hermans J', 'Slater R', 'van den Berg E', 'Kroes WG', 'van der Does-van den Berg A']","['Dutch Childhood Leukemia Study Group, The Hague, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage', 'Brain/radiation effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Germany', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/administration & dosage', 'Netherlands', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome']",2002/06/01 10:00,2002/06/25 10:01,['2002/06/01 10:00'],"['2001/07/13 00:00 [received]', '2002/12/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/06/01 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/06/25 10:01 [medline]', '2002/06/01 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402489 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2002 Jun;16(6):1099-111. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402489.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Retroviruses have enhanced our understanding of the role of c-Myc in such tumors. Leukemias and lymphomas induced by retroviruses activate c-Myc by: (1) use of virally specified proteins that increase c-Myc transcription, (2) transduction and modification of c-Myc to generate a virally encoded form of the gene, v-Myc, and (3) proviral integration in or near c-Myc. Proviral integrations elevate transcription by insertion of retroviral enhancers found in the long terminal repeat (LTR). Studies of the LTR enhancer elements from these retroviruses have revealed the importance of these elements for c-Mycactivation in several cell types. Retroviruses also have been used to identify genes that collaborate with c-Myc during development and progression of leukemias and lymphomas. In these experiments, animals that are transgenic for c-Mycoverexpression (often in combination with the overexpression or deletion of known proto-oncogenes) have been infected with retroviruses that then insertionally activate novel co-operating cellular genes. The retrovirus then acts as a molecular 'tag' for cloning of these genes. This review covers several aspects of c-Myc involvement in retrovirally induced leukemias and lymphomas.","['Dudley, J P', 'Mertz, J A', 'Rajan, L', 'Lozano, M', 'Broussard, D R']","['Dudley JP', 'Mertz JA', 'Rajan L', 'Lozano M', 'Broussard DR']","['Section of Molecular Genetics and Microbiology and Institute for Cellular and Molecular Biology, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX 78705, USA. jdudley@uts.cc.utexas.edu']",['eng'],"['CA34780/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA77760/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Disease Progression', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics/metabolism/*virology', 'Lymphoma/genetics/metabolism/*virology', 'Oncogenes', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/genetics/*physiology', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'Terminal Repeat Sequences', 'Virus Integration']",2002/06/01 10:00,2002/06/25 10:01,['2002/06/01 10:00'],"['2001/08/07 00:00 [received]', '2002/01/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/06/01 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/06/25 10:01 [medline]', '2002/06/01 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402451 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2002 Jun;16(6):1086-98. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402451.,,,,,,,193,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the viral transactivating protein Tax has been proposed to play a critical role in leukemogeneis as shown by its transforming activity in various experimental systems, additional cellular events are required for the development of ATLL. One of the genetic events in ATLL is inactivation of tumor suppressor genes. Among many candidates for tumor suppressor genes, the main genetic events have been reported to center around the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors ((CDKIs) p15INK4A, p16INK4B, p18INK4C, p19INK4D, p21WAF1, p27KIP1, and p57KIP2), p53 and Rb genes; all of them play a major regulatory role during G1 to S transition in the cell cycle. Acute/lymphomatous ATLL has frequent alterations of p15 (20%) and p16 (28-67%), while chronic/smoldering ATLL has fewer abnormalities of p15 (0-13%) and p16 (5-26%). Most of these changes are deletion of the genes; fewer samples have mutations. ATLL patients with deleted p15 and/or p16 genes have significantly shorter survival than those individuals with both genes preserved. Although genetic alterations of p18, p19, p21, p27 have rarely been reported, inactivation of these genes may contribute to the development of ATLL because low expression levels of these genes seem to mark ATLL. The p53 gene is mutated in 10-50% of acute/lymphomatous ATLL. Functional impairment of the p53 protein, even if the gene has wild-type sequences, has been suggested in HTLV-I infected cells. Each of these genetic events are mainly found in acute/lymphomatous ATLL, suggesting that alterations of these genes may be associated with transformation to an aggressive phenotype. The Rb tumor suppressor gene is infrequently structurally altered, but one half of ATLL cases have lost expression of this key protein. Notably, alterations of one of the CDKIs, p53 and Rb genes appear to obviate the need for inactivation of other genes in the same pathway. A novel tumor suppressor gene on chromosome 6q may also have a critical role in the pathogenesis of ATLL. Taken together, tumor suppressor genes are frequently altered in acute/lymphomatous ATLL and their alteration is probably the driving force fueling the transition from chronic/smoldering to acute/lymphomatous ATLL.","['Hatta, Y', 'Koeffler, H P']","['Hatta Y', 'Koeffler HP']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Nihon University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/genetics/physiology', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16/genetics/physiology', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Cyclins/genetics/physiology', 'DNA Repair', '*Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/etiology/*genetics/therapy', 'Mutation', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/genetics/physiology', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/physiology', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*genetics/physiology']",2002/06/01 10:00,2002/06/25 10:01,['2002/06/01 10:00'],"['2001/12/01 00:00 [received]', '2001/12/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/06/01 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/06/25 10:01 [medline]', '2002/06/01 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402458 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2002 Jun;16(6):1069-85. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402458.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we analyzed the expression of 11 proteins in CLL cells that are implicated in the control of apoptosis, proliferation, and differentiation, and correlated this expression profile with survival. Using a quantitative solid-phase radioimmunoassay (RIA), we measured the cellular protein levels of Bcl-2, cyclin D1, PCNA, ATM, Fas, Bax, retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARalpha), retinoic acid receptor beta (RXRbeta), Flt1, VEGF, and cellular beta2-microglobulin in 230 samples of CLL. Univariate analysis using the Cox proportional hazard model showed a correlation with survival of only the following proteins: Bcl-2 (P < 0.001), cyclin D1 (P = 0.027), Fas (P = 0.055), PCNA (P < 0.001), and ATM (P = 0.028). In a multivariate analysis using classification and regression tree analysis (CART), five groups of patients (nodes) could be generated with significant differences of survival expectation (P < 0.0001) based on levels of expression of the above proteins. Based on CART analysis, Bcl-2 levels emerge as the most important protein in predicting survival between all 11 proteins studied. Patients with marked elevation in Bcl-2 levels had the worst outcome while patients with intermediate levels, but with high levels of PCNA and cyclin D1 or abnormal ATM expression had intermediate survival. These data indicate that intracellular levels of proteins such as Bcl-2, ATM, cyclin D1, and PCNA can be used as markers to predict clinical behavior and survival in patients with CLL. The pathways in which these proteins are involved may also represent possible targets for future therapeutic trials in CLL.","['Faderl, S', 'Keating, M J', 'Do, K-A', 'Liang, S-Y', 'Kantarjian, H M', ""O'Brien, S"", 'Garcia-Manero, G', 'Manshouri, T', 'Albitar, M']","['Faderl S', 'Keating MJ', 'Do KA', 'Liang SY', 'Kantarjian HM', ""O'Brien S"", 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Manshouri T', 'Albitar M']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/*metabolism/*mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Prognosis', 'Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen/metabolism', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Survival Analysis']",2002/06/01 10:00,2002/06/25 10:01,['2002/06/01 10:00'],"['2001/12/21 00:00 [received]', '2002/02/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/06/01 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/06/25 10:01 [medline]', '2002/06/01 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402540 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2002 Jun;16(6):1045-52. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402540.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cytotoxic therapies trigger apoptosis and deregulation of apoptotic pathways contributes to chemoresistance. Loss of the apoptosis-promoting Bax has been implicated in resistance to cytotoxic therapy. We therefore evaluated ex vivo drug sensitivity of CLL, producing chemoresponse data which are prognostic indicators for B-CLL, in particular in the case of purine nucleoside analogs. To analyze the underlying mechanisms of drug resistance, we compared endogenous Bax and Bcl-2 expression to ex vivo response to eight drugs, and to survival in 39 B-CLL patients. We found that reduced Bax levels correlated well with ex vivo resistance to traditional B-CLL therapies - anthracyclines, alkylating agents and vincristine (all P < 0.04). Surprisingly, no such relationship was observed for the purine nucleoside analogs or corticosteroids (all P > 0.5). Mutational analysis of p53 could not explain the loss of Bax protein expression. Levels of Bcl-2 were not associated with sensitivity to any drug. In contrast to the ex vivo data, neither Bax or Bcl-2 expression nor doxorubicin sensitivity were associated with increased survival whereas sensitivity to fludarabine correlated with better overall survival (P = 0.031). These findings suggest that the resistance to purine nucleoside analogs and corticosteroids in B-CLL is due to inactivation of pathways different from those activated by anthracyclines, vinca alkaloids and alkylating agents and may be the molecular rationale for the efficacy of purine analogs in this disease.","['Bosanquet, A G', 'Sturm, I', 'Wieder, T', 'Essmann, F', 'Bosanquet, M I', 'Head, D J', 'Dorken, B', 'Daniel, P T']","['Bosanquet AG', 'Sturm I', 'Wieder T', 'Essmann F', 'Bosanquet MI', 'Head DJ', 'Dorken B', 'Daniel PT']","['Bath Cancer Research, Wolfson Centre, Royal United Hospital, Bath, UK.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '18D0SL7309 (Chlorambucil)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Chlorambucil/pharmacology', 'Cladribine/pharmacology', 'Cyclophosphamide/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Female', 'Glucocorticoids/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/*metabolism/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Vidarabine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein']",2002/06/01 10:00,2002/06/25 10:01,['2002/06/01 10:00'],"['2001/04/11 00:00 [received]', '2001/07/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/06/01 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/06/25 10:01 [medline]', '2002/06/01 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402539 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2002 Jun;16(6):1035-44. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402539.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Additionally, our results suggest a possible implication of moderate/strong p21(Waf1) expression, loss of p27 expression, and cyclin D1 overexpression in the Richter's transformation of CLL.","['Cobo, F', 'Martinez, A', 'Pinyol, M', 'Hernandez, L', 'Gomez, M', 'Bea, S', 'Esteve, J', 'Rozman, M', 'Bosch, F', 'Lopez-Guillermo, A', 'Montserrat, E', 'Campo, E']","['Cobo F', 'Martinez A', 'Pinyol M', 'Hernandez L', 'Gomez M', 'Bea S', 'Esteve J', 'Rozman M', 'Bosch F', 'Lopez-Guillermo A', 'Montserrat E', 'Campo E']","[""Institute of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Hematology, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer, Hospital Clinic, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.""]",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cyclin D1/metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27', 'Cyclins/metabolism', 'Female', 'Genes, p53', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/diagnosis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/metabolism']",2002/06/01 10:00,2002/06/25 10:01,['2002/06/01 10:00'],"['2001/05/11 00:00 [received]', '2001/12/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/06/01 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/06/25 10:01 [medline]', '2002/06/01 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402529 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2002 Jun;16(6):1028-34. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402529.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The natural clinical course is highly variable and chemotherapy is usually not indicated in early and stable disease. Treatment is needed in the progressive form of this leukemia. Chlorambucil, with or without steroids, has been for many years the drug of choice in the treatment of CLL. More recently, treatment approaches have included nucleoside analogues, (NA) fludarabine (FAMP) and cladribine (2-CdA, 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine), which seem to be the treatment of choice for patients failing standard therapies. Their role as first line therapy is being investigated in randomized trials and the results have recently been published. These studies have shown a higher overall response and complete remission (CR) rate and longer response duration in patients treated initially with NA than with chlorambucil or cyclophosphamide-based combination regimens. In contrast, overall survival is similar in patients treated with NA and alkylating agents. However, the randomized trials were designed as crossover studies which may influence survival. Combined use of NA with other cytotoxic drugs, cytokines, monoclonal antibodies and other agents may increase the CR and prolong survival time. However, the results of randomized trials comparing combination treatment with NA alone are not yet available. In conclusion, alkylating agents still have an important place in the routine management of the majority of CLL patients. NA should be routinely used as second line treatment and possibly as first line therapy in younger patients, who are candidates for potentially curative treatment such as stem cell transplantation and/or monoclonal antibodies.","['Robak, T', 'Kasznicki, M']","['Robak T', 'Kasznicki M']","['Department of Hematology, Medical University of Lodz, Copernicus Memorial Hospital, Lodz, Poland.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '0 (Nucleosides)', '18D0SL7309 (Chlorambucil)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/*therapeutic use', 'Chlorambucil/therapeutic use', 'Cladribine/therapeutic use', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/drug therapy', 'Nucleosides/*therapeutic use', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Failure', 'Vidarabine/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use']",2002/06/01 10:00,2002/06/25 10:01,['2002/06/01 10:00'],"['2001/04/12 00:00 [received]', '2002/02/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/06/01 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/06/25 10:01 [medline]', '2002/06/01 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402531 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2002 Jun;16(6):1015-27. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402531.,,,,,,,126,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While conventional cytogenetic analyses only detected chromosome aberrations in 40-50% of cases, new molecular cytogenetic methods, such as fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), have greatly enhanced our ability to detect chromosomal abnormalities in CLL. Today, genomic aberrations are detected in over 80% of CLL cases. Genes potentially involved in the pathogenesis were identified with ATM in a subset of cases with 11q deletion and p53 in cases with 17p13 deletion. For the most frequent aberration, the deletion 13q14, candidate genes have been isolated. Genetic subgroups with distinct clinical features have been identified. 11q deletion is associated with marked lymphadenopathy and rapid disease progression. 17p deletion predicts for treatment failure with alkylating agents, as well as fludarabine and short survival times. In multivariate analysis 11q and 17p deletions provided independent prognostic information. Recently, another important issue of genetic risk classification in CLL was identified with the mutation status of the immunoglobulin variable heavy chain genes (V(H)). CLL cases with unmutated V(H) show more rapid disease progression and shorter survival times. Whether CD38 expression can serve as a surrogate marker for V(H) mutation status is currently discussed controversially. V(H) mutation status and genomic abnormalities, such as 17p and 11q deletion, have recently been shown to be related to each other, but were of independent prognostic information in multivariate analysis. Moreover, genomic aberrations and V(H) mutation status appear to give prognostic information irrespective of the clinical stage and may therefore allow a risk assessment for individual patients early in the course of their disease.","['Stilgenbauer, S', 'Bullinger, L', 'Lichter, P', 'Dohner, H']","['Stilgenbauer S', 'Bullinger L', 'Lichter P', 'Dohner H']","['Abteilung Innere Medizin III, University of Ulm, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)']",IM,"['*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Disease Progression', '*Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Genome, Human', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/*genetics/mortality', 'Mutation', 'Survival Rate']",2002/06/01 10:00,2002/06/25 10:01,['2002/06/01 10:00'],"['2002/02/15 00:00 [received]', '2002/02/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/06/01 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/06/25 10:01 [medline]', '2002/06/01 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402537 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2002 Jun;16(6):993-1007. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402537.,,,,,,['German CLL Study Group (GCLLSG).

In order to assess the potential therapeutic value of SCT for CLL, the present article aims at answering the following crucial questions: (1) Is SCT a curative treatment? (2) Does SCT improve the prognosis of poor-risk CLL? (3) Do risk factors exist which are useful for defining prognostic groups in terms of feasibility and post-transplant outcome? The efficacy of auto-SCT relies exclusively on the cytotoxic therapy administered. To date, there is only limited hope that autotransplantation can cure the disease. Nevertheless, the results of the published series suggest that auto-SCT is capable of improving the prognosis of CLL with poor-risk features. Well defined favorable conditions for successful autografting are the status of the disease (CR or VGPR) and the number of lines of therapy (<2) before transplantation. The crucial anti-leukemic principle of allo-SCT consists in the immune-mediated GVL effects conferred with the graft. The GVL activity explains that allografting seems to be curative for at least a subset of patients. However, as long as allo-SCT in CLL is still associated with an excessively high treatment-related mortality, only selected patients with advanced poor-risk disease should be considered for allografting. The development of conditioning regimens with reduced intensity may allow extending the indications of allogeneic SCT for CLL in the near future.","['Dreger, P', 'Montserrat, E']","['Dreger P', 'Montserrat E']","['Department of Hematology, AK St Georg, Hamburg, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Bone Marrow Purging', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Factors', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Treatment Failure', 'Treatment Outcome']",2002/06/01 10:00,2002/06/25 10:01,['2002/06/01 10:00'],"['2001/09/17 00:00 [received]', '2002/01/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/06/01 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/06/25 10:01 [medline]', '2002/06/01 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402530 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2002 Jun;16(6):985-92. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402530.,,,,,,,49,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Promoters 1B and 1C are found in a 2800 bp region of DNA immediately upstream of the exon 1C transcriptional initiation site. Transcripts containing either exon 1B or 1C are expressed in a wide variety of human tissues and cultured cells. Luciferase reporter constructs were created containing promoter 1B plus 1C (-2738 to +19), promoter 1B (-2738 to -1046) alone, or promoter 1C (-1045 to +19) alone. All three constructs were equally effective in driving luciferase expression in HeLa (human cervical carcinoma) cells. In Jurkat (human T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia) cells, constructs containing promoters 1B plus 1C or promoter 1B were equally active, but the promoters 1B plus 1C construct was 35% more active than the promoter 1C construct. However, in HepG2 (human hepatoma) cells, the promoter 1C construct was as effective as promoters 1B plus 1C and more than twice as effective as promoter 1B. Sequences that reside proximal to the exon 1B transcriptional start site included three Sp1 (FP2-FP4) sites. Another site (FP1) contains the sequence TGATAG, which strongly resembles the consensus binding sequence for the GATA family of transcription factors. However, oligonucleotide competition and supershift analysis of FP1 indicates that this site is not a binding site for GATA proteins. These four sites are in addition to three YY1 and one Sp1 sites previously reported in promoter 1B. In HeLa cells, deletion of the three YY1 sites results in only a 30% loss of activity and substantial loss of activity occurs only after deletion of all four Sp1 sites, indicating the critical importance of Sp1 in GR expression in these cells. In contrast, the elimination of the three YY1 sites results in a dramatic decrease in promoter strength in both HepG2 and Jurkat cells (64 and 77%, respectively), while subsequent deletions of promoter elements do not result in substantial changes in promoter activity in these cell lines. This study shows that both promoters 1B and 1C are important for the ubiquitous expression of the human GR gene. Differences in the utilization of these promoters in various cell types are likely a reflection of different promoter availability and/or the levels of specific transcription factors in the cell. This could contribute to tissue-specific expression of GR levels in different cell types.","['Nunez, B Scott', 'Vedeckis, Wayne V']","['Nunez BS', 'Vedeckis WV']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Stanley S.

Clinical and post-mortem neuropathological examination was performed in 143 patients, aged 17-76 years, who died from AML (80 cases), BP (38), and ALL (25). Periods with co-existence of thrombocytopenia below 25 x 10(9) per l and hyperleukocytosis above 100 x 10(9) per l were identified after plotting the results and were termed the 'critical period' (CP). The study showed that the risk of death was disproportionately high during the CP. This finding was obtained in all patient groups, although it involved mainly patients with AML and BP, i.e. leukaemias with the highest frequency of hyperleukocytosis in peripheral blood. It is suggested that the risk of death during the CP is so high because leukaemic cells are a potent synergistic factor to thrombocytopenia in causing CNS haemorrhage. When a CP is detected, hyperleukocytosis and thrombocytopenia should be controlled and treated aggressively: leukapheresis and platelet concentrates should be administered. Patients with CP should not be given packed red blood cells, in order to avoid a further increase in blood viscosity, which is already high due to hyperleukocytosis. In fact, anaemia during the CP should be regarded as a potentially life-saving factor.","['Nowacki, Przemyslaw', 'Zdziarska, Barbara', 'Fryze, Cezary', 'Urasinski, Ignacy']","['Nowacki P', 'Zdziarska B', 'Fryze C', 'Urasinski I']","['Department of Neurology, Pomeranian Medical University, Szczecin, Poland.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Haematologia (Budap),Haematologia,0130266,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Cerebral Hemorrhage/*etiology/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*complications/mortality', 'Leukocytosis/*complications/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Probability', 'Risk Factors', 'Thrombocytopenia/*complications/mortality']",2002/06/01 10:00,2002/11/26 04:00,['2002/06/01 10:00'],"['2002/06/01 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/11/26 04:00 [medline]', '2002/06/01 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1163/15685590160141387 [doi]'],ppublish,Haematologia (Budap). 2002;31(4):347-55. doi: 10.1163/15685590160141387.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this retrospective study was to determine whether younger subjects with CLL (< or = 55 years of age) were different from older patients in their clinical features and prognoses. A total of 198 CLL patients registered to the centre were analyzed: 47 (24%) were 55 years of age or younger and 37 who were followed up regularly were included in the study. The male/female ratio was significantly higher in young patients (3.7 vs. 1.51; p = 0.02). More young patients were asymptomatic than old patients at initial presentation (38.3% vs. 28.5%; p > 0.05). The clinical features, laboratory findings, the distribution of both age groups into clinical stages, and the overall response rate to treatment were similar. The median time to follow-up was 62 months. During this period, 14 of the young patients died (48.3%); all were males. The median survival was longer in the young (64.5 vs. 47 months, p > 0.05). The 5-year survival rate of young patients was more than the old (57% vs. 31%), but the 10-year survival rates did not differ between the two groups (7% vs. 8%). The rate of CLL-related death was higher in young patients (71% vs. 59%; p > 0.05). Univariate analysis revealed no prognostic factor which could influence the survival probability of young patients. In this study, the prognostic values of some variables could not be assessed accurately as the number of regularly followed young patients was low and some data were missing. However, it is expected that survival will be longer in young CLL patients, so the search for different curative treatment strategies will continue.","['Pamuk, Gulsum Emel', 'Pamuk, Omer Nuri', 'Soysal, Teoman', 'Ongoren, Seniz', 'Baslar, Zafer', 'Ferhanoglu, Burhan', 'Aydin, Yildiz', 'Ulku, Birsen', 'Aktuglu, Gulten', 'Akman, Nuran']","['Pamuk GE', 'Pamuk ON', 'Soysal T', 'Ongoren S', 'Baslar Z', 'Ferhanoglu B', 'Aydin Y', 'Ulku B', 'Aktuglu G', 'Akman N']","['Department of internal Medicine, Cerrahpasa Medical Faculty, University of Istanbul, Turkey. gepamuk@yahoo.com']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Haematologia (Budap),Haematologia,0130266,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Aging/physiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infections/complications', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/complications/mortality/*physiopathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Turkey']",2002/06/01 10:00,2002/11/26 04:00,['2002/06/01 10:00'],"['2002/06/01 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/11/26 04:00 [medline]', '2002/06/01 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1163/15685590160141323 [doi]'],ppublish,Haematologia (Budap). 2002;31(4):303-11. doi: 10.1163/15685590160141323.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Research on biological prognostic factors has been actively pursued in recent years, with serum vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) being identified as prognostic factors for NHL. Here, we determined that serum VEGF and IL-6 levels are independent prognostic factors for aggressive lymphoma. Compared with normal controls, serum VEGF and IL-6 levels were significantly higher in patients with aggressive lymphoma or adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma. Furthermore, overall and disease-free survival rates for patients with high levels of VEGF or IL-6 were significantly poorer than for patients with low levels. In addition, the prognosis for patients with high levels of both serum VEGF and IL-6 was significantly poorer than that for patients with high levels of either VEGF or IL-6 or with low levels of both VEGF and IL-6. Multivariate analyses of a variety of prognostic factors, including the five IPI factors, revealed that serum VEGF and IL-6 were both independent prognostic factors for overall survival of aggressive lymphoma. Therefore, a combination of VEGF and IL-6 represents a useful prognostic factor for aggressive lymphoma.","['Niitsu, Nozomi', 'Okamato, Masataka', 'Nakamine, Hirokazu', 'Yoshino, Tadashi', 'Tamaru, Jun-ichi', 'Nakamura, Shigeo', 'Higashihara, Masaki', 'Hirano, Masami']","['Niitsu N', 'Okamato M', 'Nakamine H', 'Yoshino T', 'Tamaru J', 'Nakamura S', 'Higashihara M', 'Hirano M']","['Department of Hematology and Internal Medicine IV, Kitasato University School of Medicine, Kanagawa, Japan. nniitsu@med.kitasato-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Endothelial Growth Factors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Biomarkers/blood', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Endothelial Growth Factors/*blood', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/*blood', 'Lymphokines/*blood', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/blood/*diagnosis/mortality', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Analysis', 'Survival Rate', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors']",2002/06/01 10:00,2002/06/29 10:01,['2002/06/01 10:00'],"['2002/06/01 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/06/29 10:01 [medline]', '2002/06/01 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1034/j.1600-0609.2002.01609.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2002 Feb;68(2):91-100. doi: 10.1034/j.1600-0609.2002.01609.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Some anti-IgE antibodies (HMK-12, 6HD5) inhibit the binding of IgE to the FcepsilonRI of mast cells/basophilic leukemia cells (PT-18, RBL/2H3), but less inhibition is seen with the anti-allotypic JKS-6 and the anti-idiotypic Eb-1. Anti-IgE HMK-12 can detach bound IgE molecules from the FcepsilonRI. When mast cells or basophils were incubated with monoclonal anti-DNP-IgE SPE-7, washed and treated with anti-IgE HMK-12, anti-IgE/IgE complexes were found in the supernatant. Similar results were obtained with the Fab fragment of HMK-12. Mice injected with anti-DNP-IgE SPE-7 and later with DNP-BSA had the typical systemic anaphylactic shock. However, if they were injected with the anti-IgE antibody (HMK-12) before the challenge, they did not get an anaphylactic shock. In the sera of mice injected with monoclonal IgE SPE-7 and anti-IgE antibody (HMK-12), IgE/anti-IgE complexes were detected. No passive cutaneous anaphylaxis occurred if the rats were injected with anti-IgE antibodies before the challenge. In summary, anti-IgE antibodies can remove IgE antibodies from the FcepsilonRI; anti-IgE/IgE complexes can be detected in vitro and in vivo, and anti-IgE antibodies can inhibit IgE-mediated systemic or local anaphylactic reactions.","['Miyajima, Hiroaki', 'Watanabe, Naohiro', 'Ovary, Zoltan', 'Okumura, Ko', 'Hirano, Takao']","['Miyajima H', 'Watanabe N', 'Ovary Z', 'Okumura K', 'Hirano T']","['Division of Pathobiology, Juntendo University School of Medicine, Jikei University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Int Arch Allergy Immunol,International archives of allergy and immunology,9211652,"['0 (Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '0 (anti-IgE antibodies)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)', '45PG892GO1 (Evans Blue)']",IM,"['Anaphylaxis/*immunology/prevention & control', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic/*immunology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology', 'Basophils/*immunology', 'Evans Blue/chemistry', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Hypersensitivity, Immediate/*immunology', 'Immunoglobulin E/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute', 'Mast Cells/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Passive Cutaneous Anaphylaxis/immunology', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Receptors, IgE/immunology', 'Skin/immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/05/31 10:00,2002/07/06 10:01,['2002/05/31 10:00'],"['2002/05/31 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/07/06 10:01 [medline]', '2002/05/31 10:00 [entrez]']","['58000 [pii]', '10.1159/000058000 [doi]']",ppublish,Int Arch Allergy Immunol. 2002 May;128(1):24-32. doi: 10.1159/000058000.,,,,,,,,,"['Copyright 2002 S.

As a strategy for the immunotherapy of CML, we constructed a recombinant adeno-associated virus vector encoding the p210(BCR-ABL) b3a2 variant fusion region with flanking sequences (CWRBA) and used it to express the BCR-ABL fusion region within primary human dendritic cells (DCs), the most potent antigen-presenting cells currently known. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy donors were primed and restimulated in vitro with autologous DCs transduced with purified CWRBA, CWRAP (negative control), or pulsed with a peptide corresponding to the fusion domain (positive control). No specific responses were generated using DCs transduced with CWRAP. In contrast, CWRBA-transduced DCs primed autologous T cells in an antigen-specific, MHC-restricted fashion to levels comparable with the positive control. CWRBA-transduced DCs elicited both cytotoxic CD4+/Th1 and CD8+ responses, although the former were more readily detected in this system. Cytotoxicity against a tumor cell line endogenously expressing the p210(BCR-ABL) b3a2 variant fusion region was also demonstrable. In addition, HLA-DRB5(*)0101+DRA (DR2a) was identified as a new restriction element capable of presenting the b3a2 BCR-ABL fusion region epitope. Thus, the construct developed herein may serve as a candidate vaccine for gene-based antigen-specific immunotherapy of CML and may serve as a paradigm for the use of DCs transduced with recombinant adeno-associated virus vectors encoding multiepitope immunogens for vaccine development.","['Sun, Ji-Yao', 'Krouse, Robert S', 'Forman, Stephen J', 'Senitzer, David', 'Sniecinski, Irena', 'Chatterjee, Saswati', 'Wong, K K Jr']","['Sun JY', 'Krouse RS', 'Forman SJ', 'Senitzer D', 'Sniecinski I', 'Chatterjee S', 'Wong KK Jr']","['Division of Hematology and Stem Cell Transplantation, City of Hope National Medical Center, 1500 East Duarte Road, Duarte, CA 91010, USA.']",['eng'],"['1R01 CA 75186/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5P01 CA 30206/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 33572/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Vaccines, DNA)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Dendritic Cells/*immunology', 'Dependovirus/genetics', 'Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/*immunology', 'Genetic Vectors/genetics', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/immunology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Vaccines, DNA/genetics/*immunology']",2002/05/31 10:00,2002/07/18 10:01,['2002/05/31 10:00'],"['2002/05/31 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/07/18 10:01 [medline]', '2002/05/31 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 2002 Jun 1;62(11):3175-83.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although in vitro investigations using purified deoxycytidine kinase (dCK) or deoxyguanosine kinase (dGK) suggested that ara-G is a substrate for both enzymes, controversy exists in regard to the role of these enzymes in whole cells. In this work, we used a CEM mutant cell line containing low endogenous levels of dGK and deficient in dCK (dCK-) to assess the role of these kinases in ara-G phosphorylation. Using a retroviral vector system, we infected the dCK- mutant cell line to obtain cell lines with overexpression of dCK (dCK+) or dGK (dGK+). Only the dCK+ cell line phosphorylated 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine (used as a substrate for dCK) in a cell-free system; phosphorylation of this compound by dGK+ was below the limit of detection. Again in in vitro assays, the dCK-and dCK+ cell lines phosphorylated dGuo to similar levels (0.91 +/- 0.15 and 0.93 +/- 0.19 pmol/mg/min, respectively), whereas dGK+ phosphorylated dGuo more efficiently (150 pmol at 60 min). When ara-G was used as a substrate in a cell-free system, the maximum accumulation of phosphorylated product was observed in dGK+ extracts at low ara-G levels (10 microM) and in dCK+ extracts at high concentrations of ara-G (100 microM). Thus, both dCK and dGK can phosphorylate ara-G, but at low ara-G concentrations, dGK seems to predominate, whereas at higher ara-G concentrations, dCK seems to be the preferred enzyme. In whole-cell systems after a 3-h incubation with 10 microM ara-G, both dCK+ and dGK+ cells accumulated ara-GTP; however, the levels were significantly (P = 0.0008) higher in dGK+ cells. In contrast, at 100 microM ara-G, intracellular ara-GTP accumulated to similar levels (P = 0.5529) in these cell types; 25 +/- 3.7 microM in dCK+, and 27.8 +/- 2.7 microM in the dGK+ cells. These results from whole-cell experiments are consistent with those from the cell-free system and strongly suggest that ara-G is phosphorylated by both kinases, and at low substrate concentrations, dGK is preferred enzyme. Evaluation of the expression of each of these kinases in primary leukemia cells may reveal a biochemical basis for the pharmacological differences in the accumulation of ara-GTP.","['Rodriguez, Carlos O Jr', 'Mitchell, Beverly S', 'Ayres, Mary', 'Eriksson, Staffan', 'Gandhi, Varsha']","['Rodriguez CO Jr', 'Mitchell BS', 'Ayres M', 'Eriksson S', 'Gandhi V']","['Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas M.

Disruption of the NQO1 gene in mice caused myeloid hyperplasia of bone marrow and highly significant increases in blood neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils. NQO1-null mice also showed a decrease in lymphocytes and WBCs as compared with wild-type mice. Various techniques also demonstrated an increase in megakaryocytes without an increase in blood platelets. Histological analysis of liver, kidney, spleen, and thymus did not demonstrate a difference between wild-type and NQO1-null mice or a sign of infection. Blood cultures and urine analysis also did not demonstrate any sign of infection in NQO1-null and wild-type mice. Additional analysis of the bone marrow from NQO1-null mice revealed that loss of NQO1 alters the intracellular redox status because of accumulation of NAD(P)H, cofactors for NQO1. This causes a reduction in the levels of pyridine nucleotides and tumor suppressor proteins p53 and p73, and a decrease in apoptosis. The decrease in apoptosis causes myelogenous hyperplasia in NQO1-null mice. These results demonstrate that NQO1 acts as an endogenous factor in the protection against myelogenous hyperplasia. This is significant because 2-4% of human individuals without known abnormalities, and >25% of individuals with benzene poisoning and acute myelogenic leukemia are homozygous for a mutant allele (P187S) of NQO1 and lack NQO1 protein/activity.","['Long, Delwin J 2nd', 'Gaikwad, Amos', 'Multani, Asha', 'Pathak, Sen', 'Montgomery, Charles A', 'Gonzalez, Frank J', 'Jaiswal, Anil K']","['Long DJ 2nd', 'Gaikwad A', 'Multani A', 'Pathak S', 'Montgomery CA', 'Gonzalez FJ', 'Jaiswal AK']","['Department of Pharmacology, Baylor College of Medicine, One Baylor Plaza, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],['R01 ES 07943/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Retracted Publication']",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (TP73 protein, human)', '0 (Trp73 protein, mouse)', '0 (Tumor Protein p73)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '53-59-8 (NADP)', 'EC 1.6.5.2 (NAD(P)H Dehydrogenase (Quinone))']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'Bone Marrow Cells/enzymology/metabolism/pathology/ultrastructure', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Chromosomes', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Female', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Hyperplasia/enzymology/genetics', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/blood/enzymology/*genetics', 'NAD(P)H Dehydrogenase (Quinone)/*genetics/metabolism', 'NADP/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Tumor Protein p73', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",2002/05/31 10:00,2002/07/18 10:01,['2002/05/31 10:00'],"['2002/05/31 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/07/18 10:01 [medline]', '2002/05/31 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 2002 Jun 1;62(11):3030-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['Cancer Res. 2018 Nov 15;78(22):6526.

These studies were also performed in 7 patients who received similar myeloablative therapy and BMT but without DLI. Phenotypic reconstitution of T and natural killer cells was similar in both groups, but patients who received CD4(+) DLI developed increased numbers of CD20(+) B cells.

In a murine retroviral bone marrow transduction-transplantation model, a Tel (exon 1-5)-Abl fusion protein induced 2 distinct illnesses: a CML-like myeloproliferative disease very similar to that induced by Bcr-Abl but with increased latency and a novel syndrome characterized by small-bowel myeloid cell infiltration and necrosis, increased circulating endotoxin and tumor necrosis factor alpha levels, and fulminant hepatic and renal failure. Induction of both diseases required the Tel pointed homology oligomerization domain and Abl tyrosine kinase activity. Myeloid cells from mice with both diseases expressed Tel-Abl protein. CML-like disease induced by Tel-Abl and Bcr-Abl was polyclonal and originated from cells with multilineage (myeloid, erythroid, and B- and T-lymphoid) repopulating ability and the capacity to generate day-12 spleen colonies in secondary transplantations. In contrast to findings with Bcr-Abl, however, neither Tel-Abl-induced disease could be adoptively transferred to irradiated secondary recipient syngeneic mice.

To elucidate the biochemical processes involved in the pathogenesis of B-CLL and MCL, we analyzed the expression level of a set of genes that play central roles in apoptotic or cell proliferation pathways and of candidate genes from frequently altered genomic regions, namely ATM, BAX, BCL2, CCND1, CCND3, CDK2, CDK4, CDKN1A, CDKN1B, E2F1, ETV5, MYC, RB1, SELL, TFDP2, TNFSF10, and TP53. Performing real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction in a panel of patients with MCL and B-CLL and control samples, significant overexpression and underexpression was observed for most of these genes. Statistical analysis of the expression data revealed the combination of CCND1 and CDK4 as the best classifier concerning separation of both lymphoma types. Overexpression in these malignancies suggests ETV5 as a new candidate for a pathogenic factor in B-cell lymphomas. Characteristic deregulation of multiple genes analyzed in this study could be combined in a comprehensive picture of 2 distinctive pathomechanisms in B-CLL and MCL. In B-CLL, the expression parameters are in strong favor of protection of the malignant cells from apoptosis but did not provide evidence for promoting cell cycle. In contrast, in MCL the impairment of apoptosis induction seems to play a minor role, whereas most expression data indicate an enhancement of cell proliferation.","['Korz, Christian', 'Pscherer, Armin', 'Benner, Axel', 'Mertens, Daniel', 'Schaffner, Claudia', 'Leupolt, Elke', 'Dohner, Hartmut', 'Stilgenbauer, Stephan', 'Lichter, Peter']","['Korz C', 'Pscherer A', 'Benner A', 'Mertens D', 'Schaffner C', 'Leupolt E', 'Dohner H', 'Stilgenbauer S', 'Lichter P']","['Abteilung Molekulare Genetik and Zentrale Einheit Biostatistik, Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum, Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (ETV5 protein, human)', '0 (Echinocandins)', '0 (Fungal Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.4.1.- (Glucosyltransferases)', 'EC 2.4.1.34 (FKS1 protein, S cerevisiae)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDK4 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Apoptosis/*genetics', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/genetics', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Echinocandins', 'Female', 'Fungal Proteins/genetics', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*statistics & numerical data', '*Genes, cdc', '*Glucosyltransferases', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/etiology/*genetics', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/etiology/*genetics', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', '*Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins', 'Transcription Factors/genetics']",2002/05/31 10:00,2002/07/12 10:01,['2002/05/31 10:00'],"['2002/05/31 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/07/12 10:01 [medline]', '2002/05/31 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood.v99.12.4554 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)60061-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2002 Jun 15;99(12):4554-61. doi: 10.1182/blood.v99.12.4554.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These deletions are large, occur at the time of the Philadelphia (Ph) translocation, span the translocation breakpoint, and represent a powerful prognostic indicator. However, the molecular mechanisms responsible for the poor prognosis associated with deletions are obscure, and several possible models are investigated here. First, we demonstrate that all derivative chromosome 9 deletions detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization were associated with an absence of ABL-BCR expression. However, loss of ABL-BCR expression also occurred without an overt deletion, suggesting the existence of other mechanisms by which ABL-BCR transcription can be abolished. Furthermore, analysis of survival in 160 patients demonstrated that loss of ABL-BCR expression, in contrast to deletion status, was not an indicator of poor prognosis. Second, we addressed the possibility that concomitant small deletions of the Ph chromosome modulate BCR-ABL transcription. Real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction was used to demonstrate that derivative chromosome 9 deletions were not accompanied by altered levels of BCR-ABL transcripts. Third, deletions may represent a consequence of genetic instability within the target cell at the time of the Ph translocation, with the poor prognosis reflecting a predisposition to subsequent additional genetic alterations. However, patients with deletions do not exhibit an increased frequency of secondary cytogenetic changes following disease progression. Taken together, these data support a model in which deletions of the derivative chromosome 9 result in rapid disease progression as a result of the loss of one or more genes within the deleted region.","['Huntly, Brian J P', 'Bench, Anthony J', 'Delabesse, Eric', 'Reid, Alistair G', 'Li, Juan', 'Scott, Mike A', 'Campbell, Lynda', 'Byrne, Jennie', 'Pinto, Eleanor', 'Brizard, Andre', 'Niedermeiser, Deitger', 'Nacheva, Elizabeth P', 'Guilhot, Francois', 'Deininger, Michael', 'Green, Anthony R']","['Huntly BJ', 'Bench AJ', 'Delabesse E', 'Reid AG', 'Li J', 'Scott MA', 'Campbell L', 'Byrne J', 'Pinto E', 'Brizard A', 'Niedermeiser D', 'Nacheva EP', 'Guilhot F', 'Deininger M', 'Green AR']","['Department of Hematology, University of Cambridge, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (abl-bcr fusion protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Blast Crisis/genetics', '*Chromosome Deletion', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis/*genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/metabolism', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Survival Analysis']",2002/05/31 10:00,2002/07/12 10:01,['2002/05/31 10:00'],"['2002/05/31 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/07/12 10:01 [medline]', '2002/05/31 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood.v99.12.4547 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)60060-X [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2002 Jun 15;99(12):4547-53. doi: 10.1182/blood.v99.12.4547.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The downstream effectors of the BCR/ABL-->STAT5 pathway remain poorly defined. We show here that expression of the antiapoptotic protein A1, a member of the Bcl-2 family, and the serine/threonine kinase pim-1 are enhanced by BCR/ABL. This up-regulation requires activation of STAT5 by the signaling from SH3+SH2 domains of BCR/ABL. Enhanced expression of A1 and pim-1 played a key role in the BCR/ABL-mediated cell protection from apoptosis. In addition, pim-1 promoted proliferation of the BCR/ABL-transformed cells. Both A1 and pim-1 were required to induce interleukin 3-independent cell growth, inhibit activation of caspase 3, and stimulate cell cycle progression. Moreover, simultaneous up-regulation of both A1 and pim-1 was essential for in vitro transformation and in vivo leukemogenesis mediated by BCR/ABL.

At the first 5 follow-up time points, the frequency of MRD-positive patients and the MRD levels were higher in T-ALL than in precursor-B-ALL, reflecting the more frequent occurrence of resistant disease in T-ALL.

In patients with stage I-III disease (n = 18) the CR rate was 100% compared with 89% in stage IV (n = 27). There were 15 patients who relapsed (36%) within 12 months. The majority of relapses (47%) occurred in the mediastinum (n = 7) despite mediastinal irradiation with 24 Gy in 6 out of 7 patients. The estimates for overall survival, continuous CR, and disease-free survival at 7 years are 51%, 65%, and 62%, respectively. Stage, age, lactate dehydrogenase, and all other parameters had no influence on achievement of CR or outcome. This study demonstrates in a large cohort of patients with adult T-LBL that a high CR rate and a favorable outcome can be achieved with an ALL-type regimen. Mediastinal recurrence was the major obstacle and further improvement by intensification of chemotherapy, increased dose of mediastinal irradiation (36 Gy), and extended indications for stem cell transplantation seem to be required.","['Hoelzer, Dieter', 'Gokbuget, Nicola', 'Digel, Werner', 'Faak, Thomas', 'Kneba, Michael', 'Reutzel, Regina', 'Romejko-Jarosinska, Joanna', 'Zwolinski, Jacek', 'Walewski, Jan']","['Hoelzer D', 'Gokbuget N', 'Digel W', 'Faak T', 'Kneba M', 'Reutzel R', 'Romejko-Jarosinska J', 'Zwolinski J', 'Walewski J']","['Medical Clinic III, Department of Hematology, University of Frankfurt, Germany. hoelzer@em.uni-frankfurt.de']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage', 'Cranial Irradiation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mediastinal Neoplasms/mortality/radiotherapy/therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Pleural Neoplasms/mortality/radiotherapy/therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/mortality/pathology/*therapy', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Radiotherapy, Adjuvant', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction/methods', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",2002/05/31 10:00,2002/07/12 10:01,['2002/05/31 10:00'],"['2002/05/31 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/07/12 10:01 [medline]', '2002/05/31 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-01-0110 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)60038-6 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2002 Jun 15;99(12):4379-85. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-01-0110.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There were 69 cases of refractory anemia (RA), 86 RA with excess blasts (RAEB), 75 RAEB in transformation (RAEB-t), and 4 unclassified MDS at diagnosis. The International Prognostic Scoring System was intermediate-2 or high in 104 of the 158 available scores. Multivariate analyses focused on transplantation-related mortality (TRM), 2-year treatment failure incidence, and survival. Use of PBPCs reduced the median duration of neutropenia and thrombocytopenia by 4 and 12 days, respectively. The incidence of acute GVHD was similar whatever the graft type used. Chronic GVHD was more likely to have occurred with PBPCs (odds ratio [OR], 1.62; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.87-3.02). Two-year TRM was significantly reduced with PBPCs (relative risk [RR], 0.33; 95% CI, 0.15-0.73; P <.007), except for patients who had either RA or high-risk cytogenetics. The 2-year treatment failure incidence was significantly decreased with PBPCs, from 38% to 13% (RR, 0.22; 95% CI, 0.10-0.48; P <.001). Estimate of the 2-year event-free survival was 50% with PBPCs versus 39% with BM. In multivariate analysis, the outcome was significantly improved with PBPCs (RR, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.13-0.52; P <.001), except for patients with either RA or high-risk cytogenetics. In conclusion, PBPCs might be preferred for allogeneic transplantation in MDS patients at high risk for relapse on the basis of morphologic criteria because the use of this hematopoietic stem cell was associated with lower treatment failure incidence and improved survival.","['Guardiola, Philippe', 'Runde, Volker', 'Bacigalupo, Andrea', 'Ruutu, Tapani', 'Locatelli, Franco', 'Boogaerts, Marc A', 'Pagliuca, Antonio', 'Cornelissen, Jan J', 'Schouten, Harry C', 'Carreras, Enric', 'Finke, Jurgen', 'van Biezen, Anja', 'Brand, Ronald', 'Niederwieser, Dietger', 'Gluckman, Eliane', 'de Witte, Theo M']","['Guardiola P', 'Runde V', 'Bacigalupo A', 'Ruutu T', 'Locatelli F', 'Boogaerts MA', 'Pagliuca A', 'Cornelissen JJ', 'Schouten HC', 'Carreras E', 'Finke J', 'van Biezen A', 'Brand R', 'Niederwieser D', 'Gluckman E', 'de Witte TM']","['Service de Greffe de Moelle, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France. phguardiol@aol.com']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,['143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/administration & dosage', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization/*methods', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods/mortality', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/mortality/*therapy', 'Nuclear Family', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', '*Transplantation Immunology', 'Transplantation, Isogeneic/immunology/methods/mortality', 'Treatment Outcome']",2002/05/31 10:00,2002/07/12 10:01,['2002/05/31 10:00'],"['2002/05/31 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/07/12 10:01 [medline]', '2002/05/31 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood.v99.12.4370 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)60037-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2002 Jun 15;99(12):4370-8. doi: 10.1182/blood.v99.12.4370.,,,,,,"['Subcommittee for Myelodysplastic Syndromes of the Chronic Leukaemia Working Group', 'of the European Blood and Marrow Transplantation Group']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

GO was given in doses of 9 mg/m(2) of body-surface area on days 1 and 8 or, therapeutically equivalently, on days 1 and 15, with or without interleukin 11 (IL-11; 15 microg/kg per day on days 3 to 28), with assignment to IL-11 treatment made randomly. Complete remission (CR) rates were 2 of 26 (8%) for GO without IL-11 and 9 of 25 (36%) for GO with IL-11. Regression analyses indicated that IL-11 was independently predictive of CR but not survival. We compared GO with or without IL-11 with idarubicin plus cytosine arabinoside (IA), as previously administered, in similar patients. The CR rate with IA was 15 of 31 (48%), and survival was superior with IA compared with GO with or without IL-11 (P =.03). Besides accounting for possible covariate effects on outcome, we also accounted for possible trial effects (TEs) arising because IA and GO with or without IL-11 were not arms of a randomized trial. Bayesian posterior probabilities that GO with or without IL-11 produced longer survival than IA, after accounting for covariates and TEs, were less than 0.01 in patients with abnormal cytogenetic findings (AC) and less than 0.15 in patients with normal cytogenetic findings (NC). Regarding CR, the analogous probabilities were less than 0.02 for GO without IL-11 (all cytogenetic groups), and for GO with IL-11, less than 0.25 for AC groups and about 0.50 for NC groups. TEs 2 to 5 times the magnitude of those previously observed would be needed to conclude that survival with GO with or without IL-11 is likely longer than with IA. Thus, there is little evidence to suggest that GO with or without IL-11 should be used instead of IA in older patients with newly diagnosed AML or myelodysplastic syndrome.","['Estey, Elihu H', 'Thall, Peter F', 'Giles, Francis J', 'Wang, Xue-Mei', 'Cortes, Jorge E', 'Beran, Miloslav', 'Pierce, Sherry A', 'Thomas, Deborah A', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M']","['Estey EH', 'Thall PF', 'Giles FJ', 'Wang XM', 'Cortes JE', 'Beran M', 'Pierce SA', 'Thomas DA', 'Kantarjian HM']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA. ehestley@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Aminoglycosides)', '0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '0 (Interleukin-11)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '93NS566KF7 (Gemtuzumab)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Aminoglycosides', 'Anemia, Refractory, with Excess of Blasts/drug therapy', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*administration & dosage', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage', 'Bayes Theorem', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Gemtuzumab', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics', 'Immunotoxins/*administration & dosage', 'Infusions, Parenteral', 'Interleukin-11/*administration & dosage', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Remission Induction/methods', 'Survival Analysis', 'Therapeutic Equivalency']",2002/05/31 10:00,2002/07/12 10:01,['2002/05/31 10:00'],"['2002/05/31 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/07/12 10:01 [medline]', '2002/05/31 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood.v99.12.4343 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)60033-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2002 Jun 15;99(12):4343-9. doi: 10.1182/blood.v99.12.4343.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We analyzed the prevalence and the potential prognostic impact of FLT3 mutations in 979 AML patients. Results were correlated with cytogenetic data and the clinical response. FLT3-ITD mutations were found in 20.4% and FLT3-TKD mutations in 7.7% of the patients. Each mutation was associated with similar clinical characteristics and was more prevalent in patients with normal karyotype. Significantly more FLT3 aberrations were found in patients with FAB M5, and fewer were found in patients with FAB M2 and M6. Although less frequent in patients with cytogenetic aberrations, FLT3-ITDs were found in 13 of 42 patients with t(15;17) and in 9 of 10 patients with t(6;9). The prevalence of the ITD allele on the DNA level was heterogeneous, ranging from faint mutant bands in some patients to predominant mutant bands in others. Based on quantitative analysis, the mutant-wild-type (wt) ratio ranged from 0.03 to 32.56 (median, 0.78). Patients with a high mutant/wt ratio (ie, greater than 0.78) had significantly shorter overall and disease-free survival, whereas survival in patients with ratios below 0.78 did not differ from those without FLT3 aberrations. Multivariate analysis confirmed a high mutant/wt ratio to be a strong independent prognostic factor. Taken together, these data confirm that FLT mutations represent a common alteration in adult AML. Constitutive activation may be associated with monocytoid differentiation. A high mutant/wt ratio in ITD-positive patients appears to have a major impact on the prognostic relevance.","['Thiede, Christian', 'Steudel, Christine', 'Mohr, Brigitte', 'Schaich, Markus', 'Schakel, Ulrike', 'Platzbecker, Uwe', 'Wermke, Martin', 'Bornhauser, Martin', 'Ritter, Markus', 'Neubauer, Andreas', 'Ehninger, Gerhard', 'Illmer, Thomas']","['Thiede C', 'Steudel C', 'Mohr B', 'Schaich M', 'Schakel U', 'Platzbecker U', 'Wermke M', 'Bornhauser M', 'Ritter M', 'Neubauer A', 'Ehninger G', 'Illmer T']","['Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik I, Universitatsklinikum Carl Gustav Carus der Technischen Universitat, Dresden, Germany. thiede@mk1.med.tu-dresden.de']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Enzyme Activation/genetics', 'Genetic Testing', 'Germany/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/classification/enzymology/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Point Mutation', 'Prevalence', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*genetics/metabolism', 'Survival Analysis', 'Tandem Repeat Sequences', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3']",2002/05/31 10:00,2002/07/12 10:01,['2002/05/31 10:00'],"['2002/05/31 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/07/12 10:01 [medline]', '2002/05/31 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood.v99.12.4326 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)60031-3 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2002 Jun 15;99(12):4326-35. doi: 10.1182/blood.v99.12.4326.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With improvement in survival, it is important to assess the impact of contemporary risk-based therapies on second neoplasms in ALL survivors. A cohort of 8831 children diagnosed with ALL and enrolled on Children's Cancer Group therapeutic protocols between 1983 and 1995 were observed to determine the incidence of second neoplasms and associated risk factors. The median age at diagnosis of ALL was 4.7 years. The cohort had accrued 54 883 person-years of follow-up. Sixty-three patients developed second neoplasms, including solid, nonhematopoietic tumors (n = 39: brain tumors n = 19, other solid tumors n = 20), myeloid leukemia or myelodysplasia (n = 16), and lymphoma (n = 8). The cumulative incidence of any second neoplasm was 1.18% at 10 years (95% confidence interval, 0.8%-1.5%), representing a 7.2-fold increased risk compared with the general population. The risk was increased significantly for acute myeloid leukemia (standardized incidence ratio [SIR] 52.3), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (SIR 8.3), parotid gland tumors (SIR 33.4), thyroid cancer (SIR 13.3), brain tumors (SIR 10.1), and soft tissue sarcoma (SIR 9.1). Multivariate analysis revealed female sex (relative risk [RR] 1.8), radiation to the craniospinal axis (RR 1.6), and relapse of primary disease (RR 3.5) to be independently associated with increased risk of all second neoplasms. Risk of second neoplasms increased with radiation dose (1800 cGy RR 1.5; 2400 cGy RR 3.9). Actuarial survival at 10 years from diagnosis of second neoplasms was 39%. Follow-up of this large cohort that was treated with contemporary risk-based therapy showed that the incidence of second neoplasms remains low after diagnosis of childhood ALL.","['Bhatia, Smita', 'Sather, Harland N', 'Pabustan, Olga B', 'Trigg, Michael E', 'Gaynon, Paul S', 'Robison, Leslie L']","['Bhatia S', 'Sather HN', 'Pabustan OB', 'Trigg ME', 'Gaynon PS', 'Robison LL']","['City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, CA, USA. smason@childrensoncology group.org']",['eng'],['5 U10 CA13569-26S2/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Actuarial Analysis', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cranial Irradiation/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/diagnosis/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*epidemiology/mortality/pathology', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Recurrence', 'Risk Factors', 'Sex Factors', 'Survival Rate']",2002/05/31 10:00,2002/07/12 10:01,['2002/05/31 10:00'],"['2002/05/31 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/07/12 10:01 [medline]', '2002/05/31 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood.v99.12.4257 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)60024-6 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2002 Jun 15;99(12):4257-64. doi: 10.1182/blood.v99.12.4257.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the mechanism of de novo methylation is largely unknown. In this study, we have analyzed the sequence specificity of Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b during de novo methylation of murine Moloney leukemia virus provirus DNA in virus-infected ES cells. Provirus DNA from infected wild-type (J1), Dnmt1-/- (c/c), and Dnmt3a3b-/- (3a3b-/-) ES cells were analyzed using the bisulfite sequencing method. We demonstrate that Dnmt3 enzymes methylate predominantly CpG sites in vivo and confirm that Dnmt3 enzymes, but not Dnmt1, are responsible for de novo methylation. However, the sequence context and CpG density do not appear to influence de novo methylation, though strand bias is detectable. Interestingly, non-CpG methylation is detected as a component of de novo methylation. CpA methylation was detected at approximately 1.4% of all sites in J1 and approximately 1.0% in c/c, but only approximately 0.2% in 3a3b-/-. Few methylated CpT or CpC sites were detected. Similar results from nearest neighbor analysis of global endogenous methylation levels indicated a correlation between Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b presence and CpA methylation. These results demonstrate that the Dnmt3 enzymes methylate predominantly CpG sites and at a low frequency CpA sites with no apparent sequence preferences.","['Dodge, Jonathan E', 'Ramsahoye, Bernard H', 'Wo, Z Galen', 'Okano, Masaki', 'Li, En']","['Dodge JE', 'Ramsahoye BH', 'Wo ZG', 'Okano M', 'Li E']","['Department of Medicine, Cardiovascular Research Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, 149 13th Street, Charlestown, MA 02129, USA.']",['eng'],"['CA82389/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM52106/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Gene,Gene,7706761,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Dnmt3a protein, mouse)', '6R795CQT4H (5-Methylcytosine)', '8J337D1HZY (Cytosine)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase 1)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA Methyltransferase 3A)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA methyltransferase 3B)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (Dnmt1 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['5-Methylcytosine', 'Animals', 'CpG Islands/genetics', 'Cytosine/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase 1', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases/genetics/metabolism', '*DNA Methylation', 'DNA Methyltransferase 3A', 'DNA, Viral/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Embryo, Mammalian/cytology/metabolism/*virology', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Mutation', 'Proviruses/*genetics', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA/methods', 'Stem Cells/cytology/metabolism/*virology']",2002/05/31 10:00,2002/08/13 10:01,['2002/05/31 10:00'],"['2002/05/31 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/13 10:01 [medline]', '2002/05/31 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0378111902004699 [pii]', '10.1016/s0378-1119(02)00469-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Gene. 2002 May 1;289(1-2):41-8. doi: 10.1016/s0378-1119(02)00469-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the mechanisms of glucocorticoid resistance have been studied in some T-cell leukemic cell lines, less work has been done with B-cell lines. We established a dexamethasone (DEX)-resistant human pre-B lineage leukemia cell line (697/DEX) and investigated the mechanism of resistance. 697/DEX was over 430-fold more resistant to DEX compared with the parental cells (697/Neo). Overexpression of Bcl-2 protein was not observed in 697/DEX, different from the mechanism of resistance in Bcl-2-virus-infected cells (697/Bcl-2). Although the expression of p-glycoprotein (Pgp) in 697/DEX was positive, its functional activity was not detected. The numbers of glucocorticoid receptors (GR) in 697/DEX and 697/Bcl-2 were significantly lower than those in 697/Neo. In addition, 697/DEX and 697/Bcl-2 had higher levels of glutathione (GSH) than 697/Neo. In the presence of L-buthionine-(S, R)-sulfoximine (BSO), an inhibitor of GSH synthesis, both 697/DEX and 697/Bcl-2 recovered their sensitivity to DEX. Interestingly, cell death by the depletion of GSH did not involve caspase-3/7 activation in 697/Bcl-2 and 697/DEX, different from 697/Neo, suggesting a death mechanism through caspase-independent programmed cell death or necrosis. In conclusion, DEX-resistance in 697/DEX was related not only to a GR decrease, but also to an increase in intracellular GSH level in the DEX-resistant B-cell leukemia cell line. Circumvention of DEX-resistance with BSO may offer an approach to overcoming resistance to chemotherapy in B-cell lineage ALL.","['Inoue, Hitoshi', 'Takemura, Haruyuki', 'Kawai, Yasukazu', 'Yoshida, Akira', 'Ueda, Takanori', 'Miyashita, Toshiyuki']","['Inoue H', 'Takemura H', 'Kawai Y', 'Yoshida A', 'Ueda T', 'Miyashita T']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Fukui Medical University, Matsuoka-cho, Yoshida-gun, Fukui 910-1193.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Jpn J Cancer Res,Japanese journal of cancer research : Gann,8509412,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Receptors, Glucocorticoid)', '5072-26-4 (Buthionine Sulfoximine)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP7 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 7)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal/*pharmacology', 'Buthionine Sulfoximine/pharmacology', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspase 7', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Dexamethasone/*pharmacology', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Glutathione/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/metabolism/*pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Receptors, Glucocorticoid/metabolism', '*Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/05/31 10:00,2003/08/21 05:00,['2002/05/31 10:00'],"['2002/05/31 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/21 05:00 [medline]', '2002/05/31 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1349-7006.2002.tb01294.x [doi]'],ppublish,Jpn J Cancer Res. 2002 May;93(5):582-90. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.2002.tb01294.x.,,,PMC5927028,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The immunohistochemical expression of MCL-1 in ovarian tumors was also examined. The expression levels of BAX and MCL-1 mRNA were significantly higher in ovarian cancers and in adenomas than in normal ovaries (P < 0.05). In contrast, the BCL-2 mRNA expression level in ovarian cancers was significantly lower than in ovarian adenomas and in normal ovaries (P < 0.05). Expression of BCL-XL mRNA was no different between normal ovaries and ovarian tumors. Log-rank testing showed that low BAX mRNA expression and high MCL-1 mRNA expression significantly correlate with poor survival for patients with stage III ovarian carcinomas (BAX, P = 0.05; MCL-1, P = 0.02). Immunohistochemical analysis showed that diffuse-positive expression of MCL-1 protein in mucinous carcinomas was significantly higher than in mucinous low malignant potential (LMP) tumors (P = 0.03). In ovarian cancer cases, diffuse-positive expression of MCL-1 protein significantly correlates with advanced clinical stage, high histologic grade, and poor survival (stage, P < 0.01; grade, P = 0.01; survival, P = 0.01). These results suggest that increased MCL-1 expression may play an important role in replacing the functions of increased BAX and decreased BCL-2 in ovarian carcinoma cells, thereby promoting cell survival, and resulting in a poor prognosis for patients with ovarian cancer.","['Shigemasa, Kazushi', 'Katoh, Osamu', 'Shiroyama, Yuko', 'Mihara, Shoji', 'Mukai, Keiji', 'Nagai, Nobutaka', 'Ohama, Koso']","['Shigemasa K', 'Katoh O', 'Shiroyama Y', 'Mihara S', 'Mukai K', 'Nagai N', 'Ohama K']","['Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Hiroshima University School of Medicine, Minami-ku, Hiroshima 734-8551. kazu@hiroshima-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Jpn J Cancer Res,Japanese journal of cancer research : Gann,8509412,"['0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)']",IM,"['Cell Survival', 'DNA, Complementary/metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/physiology', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/*metabolism/mortality', 'Ovary/metabolism', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein', 'bcl-X Protein']",2002/05/31 10:00,2003/08/21 05:00,['2002/05/31 10:00'],"['2002/05/31 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/21 05:00 [medline]', '2002/05/31 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1349-7006.2002.tb01289.x [doi]'],ppublish,Jpn J Cancer Res. 2002 May;93(5):542-50. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.2002.tb01289.x.,,,PMC5927039,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While PARP-1 is believed to contribute to DNA repair, PARP-1 has been described as a coactivator for other transcription factors. Recent evidence suggests that PARP-1 forms complexes on cellular promoters, so we investigated PARP-1 complexes on the HTLV-I Tax responsive elements (TxREs) using an end-blocked DNA binding assay. We observed sequence-specific binding of PARP-1 to the TxREs. The DNA binding domain of PARP-1 was fused to the transcriptional activation domain of VP16, and this fusion protein activated the HTLV-I promoter in a TxRE-dependent manner. Internal, sequence-specific binding of PARP-1 to DNA provides a mechanism for transcriptional regulation of the HTLV-I promoter. The mechanism of PARP-1 function in the HTLV-I system may have common mechanistic steps with other cellular promoters, including the formation of active complexes on the promoter.","['Zhang, Zhan', 'Hildebrandt, Ellen F', 'Simbulan-Rosenthal, Cynthia M', 'Anderson, Mark G']","['Zhang Z', 'Hildebrandt EF', 'Simbulan-Rosenthal CM', 'Anderson MG']","['Institute of Molecular Medicine and Genetics, Medical College of Georgia, Augusta, Georgia 30912, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Gene Deletion', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Gene Products, tax/genetics/*metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Response Elements', 'Transcription, Genetic']",2002/05/31 10:00,2002/07/26 10:01,['2002/05/31 10:00'],"['2002/05/31 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/07/26 10:01 [medline]', '2002/05/31 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1006/viro.2002.1385 [doi]', 'S0042682202913851 [pii]']",ppublish,Virology. 2002 Apr 25;296(1):107-16. doi: 10.1006/viro.2002.1385.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Effects on thioredoxin reductase and glutathione reductase.,1875-84,"The human U-1285 and GLC(4) cell lines, both derived from small cell carcinoma of the lung, are present in doxorubicin-sensitive (U-1285 and GLC(4)) and doxorubicin-resistant MRP-expressing (U-1285dox and GLC(4)/ADR) variants. These sublines were examined here with respect to their susceptibilities to the toxic effects of selenite and compared to the toxic effects of selenite on the promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL-60 and its doxorubicin-resistant P-glycoprotein expressing variant. The drug-resistant U-1285dox and GLC(4)/ADR sublines proved to be 3- and 4-fold, respectively, more sensitive to the cytotoxicity of selenite than the drug-sensitive U-1285 and GLC(4) sublines, whereas no difference was observed between the HL-60 sublines. The presence of doxorubicin at a concentration equal to the IC(10) did not significantly potentiate the toxic effects of selenite. The presence of selenite did not significantly affect the expression of the multi-drug resistant proteins (MRP1, LRP and topoisomerase IIalpha) in the drug-resistant cells. The activities of thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) were higher (50 and 25%, respectively) in the drug resistant cell sublines U-1285dox and GLC(4)/ADR compared to the drug-sensitive parental lines. The activity of glutathione reductase (GR) was essentially the same in the drug-sensitive and -resistant cell lines. Exposure to selenite resulted in a 4-fold increase in both TrxR and GR activities in U-1285 cells, an effect, which was less pronounced in the presence of doxorubicin. Under similar conditions the increase in the TrxR activity in the resistant U-1285dox cell line, was only 30% and the activity of GR was unaltered. Different responses in the activity of the key enzymes in selenium metabolism are one possible mechanism explaining the differential cytotoxicity of selenium in these cells.","['Bjorkhem-Bergman, Linda', 'Jonsson, Kerstin', 'Eriksson, Lennart C', 'Olsson, Jerker M', 'Lehmann, Soren', 'Paul, Christer', 'Bjornstedt, Mikael']","['Bjorkhem-Bergman L', 'Jonsson K', 'Eriksson LC', 'Olsson JM', 'Lehmann S', 'Paul C', 'Bjornstedt M']","['Division of Pathology, Department of Microbiology, Pathology and Immunology, Karolinska Institutet, Huddinge University Hospital, SE-141 86 Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['EC 1.8.1.7 (Glutathione Reductase)', 'EC 1.8.1.9 (Thioredoxin-Disulfide Reductase)', 'HIW548RQ3W (Sodium Selenite)']",IM,"['Blotting, Western', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*physiology', 'Glutathione Reductase/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/pathology', 'Sodium Selenite/*pharmacology', 'Thioredoxin-Disulfide Reductase/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/05/30 10:00,2002/07/13 10:01,['2002/05/30 10:00'],"['2002/05/30 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/07/13 10:01 [medline]', '2002/05/30 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0006295202009814 [pii]', '10.1016/s0006-2952(02)00981-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2002 May 15;63(10):1875-84. doi: 10.1016/s0006-2952(02)00981-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['Biochem Pharmacol 2002 Jul 1;64(1):159'],,,,,,,,

Paclitaxel, an antimicrotubule agent, is highly efficacious in the treatment of adult tumors and is in clinical evaluation in childhood tumors. This study is the first to investigate the combination of arsenic and paclitaxel in the range of clinically achievable concentrations. We found that the simultaneous combination was antagonistic on proliferation of the neuroblastoma SK-N-SH cell line by using the combination index (CI) method. Moreover, a 40+/-5% decrease in paclitaxel-induced apoptosis in cells co-treated with As(2)O(3) confirmed the antagonism. The mechanism of antagonism was studied at the cellular level with 200 nM paclitaxel, twice the IC(50) value, and with 1 microM As(2)O(3) which administered singly did not affect cell survival or the microtubule network. As(2)O(3) antagonized the effects of paclitaxel on tubulin and microtubules. Paclitaxel-induced mitotic block was decreased by 20+/-2% and bundles induced by 200 nM paclitaxel were less condensed in the presence of 1 microM As(2)O(3). As(2)O(3) (10-200 microM) induced a concentration-dependent inhibition of tubulin polymerization in vitro which was maintained in presence of paclitaxel.

These drugs target DNA topoisomerase II (topo II), a nuclear enzyme that regulates DNA topology. Topo II poisoning leads to the trapping of an intermediate in the enzyme's cycle termed the ""cleavable complex."" This study aims to increase understanding of drug interactions by use of the ""TARDIS"" (trapped in agarose DNA immunostaining) assay to measure drug-induced topo II cleavable complexes in individual cells treated with anthracyclines. Mammalian cells contain two isoforms of topo II (alpha and beta) and the TARDIS assay enables visualisation of isoform-specific complexes. Drug-treated cells were embedded in agarose, lysed and incubated with anti-topo II antibodies to microscopically detect topo IIalpha or beta complexes. Results for K562 cells (at clinically relevant concentrations) showed that IDA and idarubicinol, its metabolite, formed mainly topo IIalpha cleavable complexes, the level of which decreases at doses > 1 microM for IDA. Our data suggest that this decrease is due to catalytic inhibition by IDA at these doses. Doxorubicin formed low levels of topo IIalpha complexes and negligible topo IIbeta complexes. In cytotoxicity studies, IDA and idarubicinol were equipotent, but both were more potent than daunorubicin and doxorubicin. We showed for the first time that there was a persistent increase in levels of topo IIalpha cleavable complexes after removal of IDA, suggesting that its greater effectiveness may be associated with both the longevity and high levels of these complexes.","['Willmore, Elaine', 'Errington, Fiona', 'Tilby, Michael J', 'Austin, Caroline A']","['Willmore E', 'Errington F', 'Tilby MJ', 'Austin CA']","['School of Biochemistry & Genetics, Medical School, University of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, Newcastle-upon-Tyne NE2 4HH, UK.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Catalytic Domain/drug effects', 'DNA/drug effects/metabolism', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/*metabolism', 'Daunorubicin/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/*pharmacology', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/pathology', 'Topoisomerase II Inhibitors']",2002/05/30 10:00,2002/07/13 10:01,['2002/05/30 10:00'],"['2002/05/30 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/07/13 10:01 [medline]', '2002/05/30 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0006295202009206 [pii]', '10.1016/s0006-2952(02)00920-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2002 May 15;63(10):1807-15. doi: 10.1016/s0006-2952(02)00920-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Comparisons of the amino acid sequence of VP5 with well-known Bcl-2 family member proteins showed that the VP5 protein contains Bcl-2 homology (BH) domains BH1, BH2, BH3, and BH4 but without the transmembrane region. VP5-stable clones enhanced viability, prevented membrane blebbing, delayed DNA internucleosomal cleavage, and decreased virus titer during IPNV infection but, when deleted, BH domains 1 and 2 could lose the preventable ability. In addition, VP5 was demonstrated to be able to enhance or assist in maintaining the functional half-life of survival factor Mcl-1 and regulate specific viral protein expression during the early replication cycle. Finally, we found that VP5 was capable of enhancing cell viability when cells were exposed to UV irradiation. In summary, these results suggest that the aquatic birnavirus may utilize a notable strategy via VP5 to regulate the host apoptosis-off system for enhancing progeny production.","['Hong, Jiann-Ruey', 'Gong, Hong-Yi', 'Wu, Jen-Leih']","['Hong JR', 'Gong HY', 'Wu JL']","['Laboratory of Marine Molecular Biology and Biotechnology, Institute of Zoology, Academia Sinica, Nankang, Taipei 115, Taiwan, ROC.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['0 (Capsid Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Viral Proteins)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Base Sequence', 'Capsid/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism', 'Capsid Proteins', 'Cell Line', 'Cloning, Molecular', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Infectious pancreatic necrosis virus/genetics/*pathogenicity/physiology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics', 'Salmon', 'Viral Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Virus Replication']",2002/05/30 10:00,2002/07/13 10:01,['2002/05/30 10:00'],"['2002/05/30 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/07/13 10:01 [medline]', '2002/05/30 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1006/viro.2001.1336 [doi]', 'S0042682201913364 [pii]']",ppublish,Virology. 2002 Apr 10;295(2):217-29. doi: 10.1006/viro.2001.1336.,,,,,,,,,['(c) 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The total cellular amount of Sp100, but not of Sp100 mRNA, decreased significantly, suggesting degradation of Sp100. Proteasome inhibitors induced the dispersal of Sp100 and inhibited the nuclear translocation of L2. In contrast to Sp100, Daxx was recruited to ND10 by L2 expression. Coimmunoprecipitation demonstrated interaction of the two proteins. L2-induced reorganization of ND10 was observed both in cell culture and in natural HPV lesions.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: : Cases of extranodal NHL were reported to a specialist population-based registry covering neoplastic hematological conditions in parts of England and Wales from 1986 to 1993. RESULTS: Nearly one third of all NHL, 3556 cases, were extranodal in origin giving a world standardised incidence rate of 1.9/10(5) per year. The most common sites were the skin, stomach and small intestine and high-grade malignancies were predominant. An excess in male incidence was observed for extranodal NHL overall, at all ages, and for most sites. Time-trend analyses indicated significant increases in incidence for all extranodal NHL and NHL of the gastrointestinal tract, skin, central nervous system and male genital organs. Incidence rates increased proportionally more for middle-aged persons, especially females, and for skin lymphomas excluding mycosis fungoides and Sezary disease. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the rise in incidence of extranodal NHL may be due, at least in part, to an increase specifically in B-cell skin lymphomas and that particular environmental factors such as sunlight might be involved rather than the increases being the results of improvements in diagnostic practices.","['Gurney, Karen A', 'Cartwright, Ray A']","['Gurney KA', 'Cartwright RA']","['Leukaemia Research Fund Centre for Clinical Epidemiology at Leeds University, Institute of Epidemiology, Margaret Smith Building, 30 Hyde Terrace, LS2 9LN, UK. k.a.gurney@leeds.ac.uk']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Hematol J,The hematology journal : the official journal of the European Haematology Association,100965523,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'England/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Intestinal Neoplasms/epidemiology/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*classification/*epidemiology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Sex Factors', 'Skin Neoplasms/epidemiology/pathology', 'Stomach Neoplasms/epidemiology/pathology', 'Wales/epidemiology']",2002/05/29 10:00,2002/11/28 04:00,['2002/05/29 10:00'],"['2001/11/09 00:00 [received]', '2001/12/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/05/29 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/11/28 04:00 [medline]', '2002/05/29 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.thj.6200154 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematol J. 2002;3(2):95-104. doi: 10.1038/sj.thj.6200154.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, we demonstrated that the Friend virus susceptibility locus, Fv2, which is required for the expansion of infected cells, encodes a naturally occurring, N-terminally truncated form of the Stk receptor tyrosine kinase (Sf-Stk). Here we show that in vitro expression of Sf-Stk confers Friend virus sensitivity to erythroid progenitor cells from Fv2(rr) mice. Furthermore, our data reveal that Sf-Stk kinase activity and Y436, but not Y429, are required for Epo-independent colony formation following Friend virus infection. Introduction of a mutation that results in failure to bind Grb2 abrogates the ability of Sf-Stk to induce colonies in response to Friend virus, while the Grb2 binding site from EGFR restores this response. Consistent with the ability of Grb2 to recruit SOS and Gab1, the Ras/MAPK and PI3K pathways are activated by Sf-Stk, and both of these pathways are required for gp55-mediated erythroblast proliferation. These data clearly demonstrate a requirement for signaling through Sf-Stk in the Epo-independent expansion of Friend virus-infected cells, and suggest a pivotal role for Grb2 in this response.","['Finkelstein, Lisa D', 'Ney, Paul A', 'Liu, Qing-Ping', 'Paulson, Robert F', 'Correll, Pamela H']","['Finkelstein LD', 'Ney PA', 'Liu QP', 'Paulson RF', 'Correll PH']","['Department of Veterinary Science, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania, PA 16802, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 HL066471/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA084214-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL66471/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA084214-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA084214-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA084214-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA084214/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA084214-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (GRB2 Adaptor Protein)', '0 (Grb2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (glycoprotein gp55, Friend spleen focus-forming virus)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (RON protein)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['*Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Erythroblasts/metabolism/*virology', 'Erythropoietin/physiology', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/*pathogenicity', 'GRB2 Adaptor Protein', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/virology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Proteins/*metabolism', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/*chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tyrosine/genetics/physiology', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/genetics']",2002/05/29 10:00,2002/06/12 10:01,['2002/05/29 10:00'],"['2001/11/19 00:00 [received]', '2002/02/06 00:00 [revised]', '2002/02/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/05/29 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/06/12 10:01 [medline]', '2002/05/29 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1205442 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 2002 May 16;21(22):3562-70. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1205442.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we showed that PML is a potent transcriptional repressor of Nur77, an orphan receptor and a member of the steroid receptor superfamily of proteins. We found that PML represses Nur77-mediated transactivation through a physical and functional interaction between the two proteins. PML interacts with Nur-77 in vitro in a GST-pull down assay and in vivo by coimmunoprecipitation assay. PML/Nur77 colocalized in vivo in a double immunofluorescent staining and confocal microscopic analysis. Our study further showed that the coiled-coil domain of PML interacts with the DNA-binding domain of Nur77 (amino acids 267-332). Electrophoretic mobility shift assay demonstrated that PML interferes with Nur77 DNA binding in a dose-dependent manner.

Mutations of p53 have been found in hematological malignant diseases, but the frequency of these alterations is much lower than in solid tumors. These mutations occur especially as hematopoietic abnormalities become more malignant such as going from the chronic phase to the blast crisis of chronic myeloid leukemia. A broad spectrum of tumor suppressor gene alterations do occur in hematological malignancies, especially structural alterations of p15(INK4A), p15(INK4B) and p14(ARF) in acute lymphoblastic leukemia as well as methylation of these genes in several myeloproliferative disorders. Tumor suppressor genes are altered via different mechanisms, including deletions and point mutations, which may result in an inactive or dominant negative protein. Methylation of the promoter of the tumor suppressor gene can blunt its expression. Chimeric proteins formed by chromosomal translocations (i.e. AML1-ETO, PML-RARalpha, PLZF-RARalpha) can produce a dominant negative transcription factor that can decrease expression of tumor suppressor genes.

It is a transcription regulator that is part of an extensive network of interacting factors. Most probably, different biological responses are elicited by different overlapping subsets of c-Myc target genes, both induced and suppressed. Results obtained from studies employing mouse models are consistent with the need for at least one, and possibly two, mutations in addition to deregulated c-myc for malignant tumor formation. Repression of c-myc is required for terminal differentiation of many cell types, including hematopoietic cells. It has been shown that deregulated expression of c-myc in both M1 myeloid leukemic cells and normal myeloid cells derived from murine bone marrow, not only blocked terminal differentiation and its associated growth arrest, but also induced apoptosis, which is dependent on the Fas/CD95 pathway. There is evidence to suggest that the CD95/Fas death receptor pathway is an integral part of the apoptotic response associated with the end of the normal terminal myeloid differentiation program, and that deregulated c-myc expression can activate this signaling pathway prematurely. The ability of egr-1 to promote terminal myeloid differentiation when co-expressed with c-myc, and of c-fos to partially abrogate the block imparted by deregulated c-myc on myeloid differentiation, make these two genes candidate tumor suppressors. Several different transcription factors have been implicated in the down-regulation of c-myc expression during differentiation, including C/EBPalpha, CTCF, BLIMP-1, and RFX1.

These cytokines include colony stimulating factors and others, which interact in a network, and there is a cytokine cascade which couples growth and differentiation. A network allows considerable flexibility and a ready amplification of response to a particular stimulus. A network may also be necessary to stabilize the whole system. Cells called hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) can repopulate all hematopoietic lineages in lethally irradiated hosts, and under appropriate conditions give rise to neuronal, muscle, and epithelial cells. Granulocyte colony stimulating factor induces migration of both HSC and in vitro colony forming cells from the bone marrow to peripheral blood. Granulocyte colony stimulating factor is also used clinically to repair irradiation and chemotherapy associated suppression of normal hematopoiesis in cancer patients, and to stimulate normal granulocyte development in patients with infantile congenital agranulocytosis. It is suggested that there may also be appropriate conditions under which in vitro colony forming cells have a wider differentiation potential similar to that shown by HSC. An essential part of the developmental program is cytokine suppression of apoptosis by changing the balance in expression of apoptosis inducing and suppressing genes. Decreasing the level of cytokines that suppress therapeutic induction of apoptosis in malignant cells can improve cancer therapy. Cytokines and some other compounds can reprogram abnormal developmental programs in leukemia, so that the leukemic cells differentiate to mature non dividing cells, and this can also be used for therapy. There is considerable plasticity in the developmental programs of normal and malignant cells.","['Lotem, Joseph', 'Sachs, Leo']","['Lotem J', 'Sachs L']","['Department of Molecular Genetics, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot 76100, Israel.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Cytokines)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/metabolism', 'Cytokines/metabolism/*physiology', 'Granulocytes/metabolism', 'Hematopoiesis/*physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Models, Biological']",2002/05/29 10:00,2002/06/18 10:01,['2002/05/29 10:00'],"['2002/05/29 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/06/18 10:01 [medline]', '2002/05/29 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1205319 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 2002 May 13;21(21):3284-94. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1205319.,,,,,,,102,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Treatment of tumor model cell lines with taxol induces apoptosis, but exact mechanism is not sufficiently understood. Our results demonstrate that in response to taxol, various cell types differentially utilize distinct apoptotic pathways. Using MCF7 breast carcinoma cells transfected with caspase-3 gene, we showed that taxol-induced apoptosis occurred in the absence of caspase-3 and caspase-9 activation. Similar results were obtained with ovarian SKOV3 carcinoma cells, expressing high level of endogenous caspase-3. In contrast, staurosporine-induced apoptosis in these cells was accompanied by proteolytic cleavage of pro-caspase-3 and induction of caspase-3 enzymatic activity. The effect of taxol appears to be cell type-specific, since taxol-induced apoptosis in leukemia U937 cells involved caspase-3 activation step. We conclude that a unique caspase-3 and caspase-9 independent pathway is elicited by taxol to induce apoptosis in human ovarian and breast cancinoma cells.","['Ofir, R', 'Seidman, R', 'Rabinski, T', 'Krup, M', 'Yavelsky, V', 'Weinstein, Y', 'Wolfson, M']","['Ofir R', 'Seidman R', 'Rabinski T', 'Krup M', 'Yavelsky V', 'Weinstein Y', 'Wolfson M']","['Department of Research and Development Hazeva, Ben Gurion University of the Negev, Beer Sheva 84105, Israel.']",['eng'],['5R03 TW00927/TW/FIC NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Cell Death Differ,Cell death and differentiation,9437445,"['EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy/enzymology/metabolism/pathology', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspase 9', 'Caspases/genetics/*metabolism', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/*drug therapy/enzymology/metabolism/pathology', 'Paclitaxel/*pharmacology', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/05/29 10:00,2002/12/19 04:00,['2002/05/29 10:00'],"['2001/06/19 00:00 [received]', '2001/11/27 00:00 [revised]', '2001/12/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/05/29 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/19 04:00 [medline]', '2002/05/29 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.cdd.4401012 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Death Differ. 2002 Jun;9(6):636-42. doi: 10.1038/sj.cdd.4401012.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this context, the transfer of genes able to accentuate the effect of anticancer drugs may constitute a useful approach, as exemplified by inactivation of nuclear factor (NF)-kappa B via direct transfer of a gene encoding a negative dominant of its natural inhibitor I kappa B, leading to improved response to cancer chemotherapy. Following our previous report that transfection of human growth hormone (hGH) gene into human monocytic cell lines may also inactivate NF-kappa B in another situation, we decided to test the consequences of hGH gene transfer on cancer treatments. We demonstrated that hGH-transfected human myeloid leukemia U937 cells were sensitized to an apoptotic signal mediated by the anticancer drugs. In parallel, we found that, by inhibiting degradation of I kappa B, hGH gene transfer diminished NF-kappa B entry into the nuclei of U937 cells exposed to daunorubicin. Finally, we report that hGH-transfected tumor cells engrafted in nude mice responded in vivo to chemotherapy with nontoxic doses of daunorubicin whereas, under the same conditions, control tumor cells remained insensitive. Overall, this study therefore suggests that hGH gene transfer may offer new therapeutic prospects in cancer therapy.","['Cherbonnier, C', 'Deas, O', 'Vassal, G', 'Merlin, J L', 'Haeffner, A', 'Senik, A', 'Charpentier, B', 'Durrbach, A', 'Benard, J', 'Hirsch, F']","['Cherbonnier C', 'Deas O', 'Vassal G', 'Merlin JL', 'Haeffner A', 'Senik A', 'Charpentier B', 'Durrbach A', 'Benard J', 'Hirsch F']","['INSERM U542/Paris XI University, Villejuif Cider, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cancer Gene Ther,Cancer gene therapy,9432230,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '12629-01-5 (Human Growth Hormone)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Body Weight/drug effects', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Daunorubicin/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Human Growth Hormone/*genetics', 'Humans', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/*therapy', 'Time Factors', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'U937 Cells']",2002/05/29 10:00,2002/11/01 04:00,['2002/05/29 10:00'],"['2002/03/08 00:00 [received]', '2002/05/29 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/11/01 04:00 [medline]', '2002/05/29 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.cgt.7700467 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Gene Ther. 2002 Jun;9(6):497-504. doi: 10.1038/sj.cgt.7700467.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The RAR(alpha) gene has drawn particular attention because it is the common target in all chromosomal translocations in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), a unique model in cancer research that responds to the effect of RA. In the great majority of patients with APL, RAR(alpha) is fused to the PML gene as a result of the t(15;17) translocation. Three distinct types of PML-RAR(alpha) transcripts, long (L), short (S), and variant (V), were identified. The V-type is characterized by truncation of exon 6 of PML and in some cases by the insertion of a variable ""spacer"" sequence between the truncated PML and RAR(alpha) mRNA fusion partners, although the precise mechanisms underlying formation of the V-type transcript remain unclear. To get further insights into the molecular basis of the t(15;17), we sequenced the entire genomic DNA region of RAR(alpha). Of note, all previously reported ""spacer"" sequences in V-type transcripts were found in intron 2 of the RAR(alpha) gene and most of these sequences were flanked by gt splice donor sites. In most cases, these ""cryptic"" coding sequences maintained the ORF of the chimeric transcript. Interestingly, two cases with a relatively long spacer sequence showed APL cellular and clinical resistance to RA treatment. In these cases, the aberrant V-type PML-RAR(alpha) protein displayed increased affinity to the nuclear corepressor protein SMRT, providing further evidence that RA exerts the therapeutic effect on APL through modulation of the RAR-corepressor interaction. Finally, among patients with the L- or S-type PML-RAR(alpha) fusion transcript, some consensus motifs were identified at the hotspots of the chromosome 17q breakpoints within intron 2 of RAR(alpha), strengthening the importance of this intron in the molecular pathogenesis of APL.","['Gu, Bai-Wei', 'Xiong, Hui', 'Zhou, Yan', 'Chen, Bing', 'Wang, Li', 'Dong, Shuo', 'Yu, Zhi-Yuan', 'Lu, Ling-Feng', 'Zhong, Ming', 'Yin, Hai-Feng', 'Zhu, Gen-Feng', 'Huang, Wei', 'Ren, Shuang-Xi', 'Gallagher, Robert E', 'Waxman, Samuel', 'Chen, Guo-Qiang', 'Wang, Zhu-Gang', 'Chen, Zhu', 'Fu, Gang', 'Chen, Sai-Juan']","['Gu BW', 'Xiong H', 'Zhou Y', 'Chen B', 'Wang L', 'Dong S', 'Yu ZY', 'Lu LF', 'Zhong M', 'Yin HF', 'Zhu GF', 'Huang W', 'Ren SX', 'Gallagher RE', 'Waxman S', 'Chen GQ', 'Wang ZG', 'Chen Z', 'Fu G', 'Chen SJ']","['State Key Lab for Medical Genomics and Samuel Waxman Cancer Research Foundation Lab, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Rui Jin Hospital, Shanghai Second Medical University, 197 Rui Jin Road II, Shanghai 200025, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '0 (Retinoid X Receptors)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Base Sequence', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', '*Genetic Variation', 'Humans', 'Introns', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/classification/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/*genetics', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'Retinoid X Receptors', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Transcription Factors/genetics', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Tretinoin/*therapeutic use']",2002/05/29 10:00,2002/07/02 10:01,['2002/05/29 10:00'],"['2002/05/29 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/07/02 10:01 [medline]', '2002/05/29 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.112194799 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2002 May 28;99(11):7640-5. doi: 10.1073/pnas.112194799.,['GENBANK/AC090426'],,PMC124308,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Expression of BCR/ABL is both necessary and sufficient to cause a chronic myeloproliferative syndrome in murine bone marrow transplantation models, and absolutely depends on kinase activity. Progression of CML to acute leukemia (blast crisis) in humans has been associated with acquisition of secondary chromosomal translocations, including the t(7;11)(p15;p15) resulting in the NUP98/HOXA9 fusion protein. We demonstrate that BCR/ABL cooperates with NUP98/HOXA9 to cause blast crisis in a murine model. The phenotype depends both on expression of BCR/ABL and NUP98/HOXA9, but tumors retain sensitivity to the ABL inhibitor STI571 in vitro and in vivo. This paradigm is applicable to other constitutively activated tyrosine kinases such as TEL/PDGFbetaR. These experiments document cooperative effects between constitutively activated tyrosine kinases, which confer proliferative and survival properties to hematopoietic cells, with mutations that impair differentiation, such as the NUP98/HOXA9, giving rise to the acute myeloid leukemia (AML) phenotype.

The two-way interaction between tumor cells and host cells is of crucial importance in this context. In the present study we investigated the effect of tumor cell-endothelial cell co-culture on the expression of procoagulant activity in the mixed cell populations. DESIGN AND METHODS: Human tumor cell lines (HL60 promyelocytic leukemia and HeLa uterine cervical cancer) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were cultured in vitro according to standard procedures. Procoagulant activity was studied in a coagulometer and was found to be tissue factor-like. A calibration curve was obtained with decreasing concentrations of rabbit brain thromboplastin (RBT) and the procoagulant activity of both tumor cells and HUVEC was expressed as RBT U/10(5) cells. RESULTS: Before incubation procoagulant activity (means S.E.) was found to be 0.18 +/- 0.04 U in HUVEC, 9.8 +/- 1.9 U in HL60 cells, 11.9 +/- 2.2 U in HeLa cells, 7.2 +/- 1.4 U in a mixed HL60 cell-HUVEC population (ratio 2:1) and 8.5 +/- 2.0 in a mixed HeLa cell-HUVEC population (ratio 2:1). Incubation at 37 degrees C for up to 4 hours of tumor cells or HUVEC alone did not produce any change in procoagulant activity. In contrast, co-incubation of tumor cells with HUVEC for 4 hours was followed by a significant increase in procoagulant activity of the mixed cell populations. Addition of supernatants from tumor cells, HUVEC or tumor cell-HUVEC co-cultures to HUVEC or tumor cells showed that the tissue factor-like procoagulant activity generated during coincubation was localized on HUVEC. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that the close interaction of tumor cells with endothelial cells may induce surface expression of tissue factor in the latter. This effect could represent an additional mechanism of clotting activation in patients with cancer.","['Maiolo, Anna', 'Tua, Aldo', 'Grignani, Guido']","['Maiolo A', 'Tua A', 'Grignani G']","['Department of Internal Medicine and Medical Therapy, City of Pavia Institute for Medical Care, University of Pavia, viale Parco Vecchio 27, 27100 Pavia, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '9035-58-9 (Thromboplastin)']",IM,"['*Cell Communication', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Culture Media, Conditioned/pharmacology', 'Endothelium, Vascular/cytology/drug effects/*metabolism', '*Hemostasis', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*metabolism/pathology', 'Thromboplastin/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Umbilical Cord']",2002/05/29 10:00,2003/08/06 05:00,['2002/05/29 10:00'],"['2002/05/29 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/06 05:00 [medline]', '2002/05/29 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2002 Jun;87(6):624-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, only a small fraction of patients remain free of disease in the long-term and most patients will finally relapse. The clinical presentation of relapse after transplantation is very heterogeneous and few reports have analyzed this situation. We report the clinical patterns of relapses after autologous transplantation of 280 patients with MM included in a Spanish Multicenter Registry. DESIGN AND METHODS: The medical records of 560 patients with MM transplanted in different centers in Spain, included in the Spanish Registry of Transplant in Multiple Myeloma, were reviewed. At diagnosis, 48 (8%) had stage I disease, 143 (25%) stage II and 369 (65%) stage III. The median time from diagnosis to transplantation was 13 months (4-143). The median age was 53 years (23-70). Of the 502 patients assessable for response to intensification therapy after transplantation, 241 (48%) achieved a complete response and 220 (43%) a partial response. The clinical characteristics of 280 patients (52%) who had relapsed after transplantation were retrospectively assessed during long-term post-transplantation follow-up. RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 23 months, 280(52%) patients had relapsed or progressed after transplantation. The median overall survival was 52 months (SE 8), (CI 95% 37-68) and median estimated progression-free survival was 33 months (SE 2.2, CI 95% 27-38). The median period for relapse was 30 months (2-84) with an actuarial risk of progression or relapse at 60 months after transplantation of 78%. The clinical patterns of relapse were very heterogeneous: 40 cases (14%) presented extramedullary manifestations with multiple plasmacytomas as the main symptoms of relapse, with a minimum or null monoclonal component (MC). In 51 cases (18%) only an insidious increase of MC protein in serum or urine was detected without other clinical manifestations. In 6 cases (2%) the relapse had criteria of plasmacytic leukemia. The remaining patients presented progressive increase of MC associated with plasmacytic bone marrow infiltration and different clinical myeloma symptoms, mainly new osteolytic lesions. The therapeutic approach was also very heterogeneous, with a global antitumoral response of 30%. Median overall survival after relapse was 14 months (SE 1.4) (CI 95% 11-17). INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: The patterns of relapse of MM after high-dose therapy are very heterogeneous. The different clinical expressions of relapse may be due to clonal selection after high-dose therapy and could indicate the persistence of a resistant clone. Some patients relapse with extraosseous plasmacytomas without systemic disease. These findings suggest the need for an individualized approach during clinical follow-up after transplantation. Regarding treatment response, patients with myeloma who relapse after high-dose chemotherapy have been classically considered to have few therapeutic options. However, we observed that after different lines of treatment, at least one-third of patients responded, with a median overall survival, after relapse of 14 months. New drugs, such as thalidomide, have been recently proved to be effective in MM patients and could increase the response rate and survival of these patients.","['Alegre, Adrian', 'Granda, Asuncion', 'Martinez-Chamorro, Carmen', 'Diaz-Mediavilla, Joaquin', 'Martinez, Rafael', 'Garcia-Larana, Jose', 'Lahuerta, Juan-Jose', 'Sureda, Anna', 'Blade, Joan', 'de la Rubia, Javier', 'Fernandez-Ranada, Jose Maria', 'San Miguel, Jesus']","['Alegre A', 'Granda A', 'Martinez-Chamorro C', 'Diaz-Mediavilla J', 'Martinez R', 'Garcia-Larana J', 'Lahuerta JJ', 'Sureda A', 'Blade J', 'de la Rubia J', 'Fernandez-Ranada JM', 'San Miguel J']","['Department of Hematology, Hospital Universitario de la Princesa, Diego de Leon 62, 28006 Madrid, Spain. adrian.alegre@eresmas.net']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/epidemiology/mortality/*therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Registries', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Spain/epidemiology', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/*mortality', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation, Autologous/mortality']",2002/05/29 10:00,2003/08/06 05:00,['2002/05/29 10:00'],"['2002/05/29 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/06 05:00 [medline]', '2002/05/29 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2002 Jun;87(6):609-14.,,,,['Haematologica. 2002 Jun;87(6):563.

The morphologic pattern of CLL lymphocytes at diagnosis has been associated with likelihood of different prognoses, while its prognostic significance at the time of disease progression is uncertain. DESIGN AND METHODS: In 69 previously untreated patients with advanced CLL the morphology of peripheral blood (PB) lymphocytes was retrospectively analyzed prior to therapy with fludarabine (FD: 25 mg/m(2) x 5 consecutive days every 4 weeks) and prednisone (P: 40 mg/m(2) x 5 consecutive days every 4 weeks). Two groups of patients were identified: the first one characterized by typical CLL morphology (T) and < or =11% of atypical lymphocytes, and the second one characterized by >11% of atypical lymphocytes (A). The second group was further subdivided into a group characterized by prolymphocyte prevalence (Ap) and into a group characterized by mixed cell morphology (Amc), with a prevalence of large-sized lymphocytes and/or small, cleaved lymphocytes and/or lymphoplasmocytoid cells with or without shaped nucleus. RESULTS: Forty-two patients (61%) showed a T morphology and 27 (39%) an A morphology. The latter group included 14 patients with an Ap morphology and 13 with an Amc morphology. Two thirds of patients with A morphology showed an immunophenotypic score of 3-4. No significant differences in the distribution of clinical features prior to therapy were observed within the three morphologic groups (T, Ap, Amc), except for a higher lymphocyte count in the Ap group (p<0.05). The morphologic pattern did not have a significant impact on the response rate or on the duration of response. Patients with A morphology did, nonetheless, have a significantly shorter survival than patients with T morphology (p=0.05). However, in multivariate analysis we failed to demonstrate an independent prognostic effect of the lymphocyte morphology observed prior to therapy, while age (< or =55 vs >55 years) and CLL duration (< or =12 vs >12 months) emerged as significant and independent prognostic factors of survival probability. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study indicate that about one third of CLL patients with advanced disease have an atypical morphology and that about two thirds of patients with A morphology also show a low immunophenotypic score. The morphologic pattern at the time of progression does not allow identification of prognostic subgroups of patients with different response rates to first line therapy with FD + P.","['Mauro, Francesca Romana', 'Gentile, Massimo', 'Mancini, Francesca', 'Giannarelli, Diana', 'Guarini, Anna', 'De Propriis, Maria Stefania', 'Cerretti, Raffaella', 'Foa, Robin']","['Mauro FR', 'Gentile M', 'Mancini F', 'Giannarelli D', 'Guarini A', 'De Propriis MS', 'Cerretti R', 'Foa R']","['Dipartimento di Biotecnologie Cellulari ed Ematologia, University of Rome La Sapienza, Via Benevento 6, 00161 Rome, Italy. mauro@bce.med.uniroma1.it']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/*mortality/*pathology', 'Lymphocytes/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Prognosis', 'Staining and Labeling', 'Survival Analysis', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives']",2002/05/29 10:00,2003/08/06 05:00,['2002/05/29 10:00'],"['2002/05/29 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/06 05:00 [medline]', '2002/05/29 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2002 Jun;87(6):602-8.,,,,['Haematologica. 2002 Jun;87(6):561-2.

We investigated systemic leptin levels in AML patients and in vitro effects of leptin on cultured AML blasts. DESIGN AND METHODS: Serum leptin levels were compared for patients with untreated AML and healthy controls. Native AML blasts were derived from a large group of consecutive patients, and effects of leptin on proliferation (suspension cultures and colony formation), constitutive cytokine secretion, differentiation and apoptosis regulation were assayed in vitro. RESULTS: Systemic leptin levels were decreased in patients with untreated AML, and leptin levels in acute leukemia patients were not altered during severe chemotherapy-induced cytopenia and complicating febrile neutropenia. In vitro studies demonstrated that leptin increased AML blast release of interleukin (IL) 1beta, IL6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). This enhancing effect showed no correlation with CD34 expression and was not dependent on the presence of serum, induction of differentiation or alteration of caspase 3 activity with decreased in vitro apoptosis. Leptin also increased spontaneous AML blast proliferation, whereas divergent effects on blast proliferation were observed in the presence of exogenous cytokines. The in vitro effects were usually observed at concentrations exceeding the systemic levels. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that systemic leptin levels alone do not have a major influence on native AML blasts, but the systemic levels in combination with local leptin release in the bone marrow may affect the functional characteristics of these cells.","['Bruserud, Oystein', 'Huang, Tien-sheng', 'Glenjen, Nils', 'Gjertsen, Bjorn Tore', 'Foss, Brynjar']","['Bruserud O', 'Huang TS', 'Glenjen N', 'Gjertsen BT', 'Foss B']","['Medical Department, Haukeland University Hospital, N-5021 Bergen, Norway. oystein.bruserud@haukeland.no']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Leptin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cytokines/drug effects/metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leptin/*metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/drug effects/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",2002/05/29 10:00,2003/08/06 05:00,['2002/05/29 10:00'],"['2002/05/29 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/06 05:00 [medline]', '2002/05/29 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2002 Jun;87(6):584-95.,,,,['Haematologica. 2002 Jun;87(6):562-3.

A microarray analysis.",569-77,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Translocation-associated gene fusions are well recognized in acute myeloid leukemia. Other molecular genetic changes are less well known. The novel cDNA technology has opened the avenue to large-scale gene expression analysis. Our aim was to perform cDNA microarray analysis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). DESIGN AND METHODS: We performed cDNA microarray analysis using the Clontech hematology filter (containing 406 genes) on 15 patients to study gene expression profiling in AML. As reference, we used whole bone marrow from 5 healthy donors. RESULTS: Our results revealed 50 differentially expressed genes in at least 3 out of 15 patients. Twenty-two genes were upregulated (ratio > or =4), whereas 28 genes were downregulated (ratio < or =0.25). All but one of the 13 genes tested by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) showed the same expression profiles. Among the overexpressed genes, several were those earlier associated with chromosomal translocations and gene fusions. These genes were FGFR1, MYC, NPM1, DEC, and BCL2. The expression of two upregulated genes, HOXA4 and CSF1R, was significantly higher in patients with a white blood cell count higher than 30 x 10(9)/L cells.

Constitutive overexpression of nuclear PLCbeta(1) has been previously shown to inhibit Friend cells differentiation. For further characterization, we investigated the localization of PLCbeta(1)a and PLCbeta(1)b in Friend cells by fusing their cDNA to enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP). To investigate the potential target of nuclear PLCbeta(1) in Friend differentiation, we studied the expression of p45/NF-E2 transcription factor, which is an enhancer binding protein for expression of the beta-globin gene and the expression of GATA proteins that are important for the survival and differentiation of erythroid cells. Our data suggest that the overexpression of PLCbeta(1) (both 1a and 1b) only in the nuclear compartment significantly reduces the expression of p45/NF-E2. The effect observed is attributable to the specific action of nuclear PLCbeta(1) signalling given that GATA-1 and GATA-3 are not affected at all. Here we show the existence of a unique target, i.e. the transcription factor p45/NF-E2, whose expression is specifically inhibited by the nuclear signalling evoked by PLCbeta(1) forms.","['Faenza, Irene', 'Matteucci, Alessandro', 'Bavelloni, Alberto', 'Marmiroli, Sandra', 'Martelli, Alberto M', 'Gilmour, R Stewart', 'Suh, Pann-Ghill', 'Manzoli, Lucia', 'Cocco, Lucio']","['Faenza I', 'Matteucci A', 'Bavelloni A', 'Marmiroli S', 'Martelli AM', 'Gilmour RS', 'Suh PG', 'Manzoli L', 'Cocco L']","['Cellular Signaling Laboratory, Department of Anatomical Sciences, University of Bologna, Via Irnerio 48, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '0 (NF-E2 Transcription Factor, p45 Subunit)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', 'EC 3.1.4.- (Type C Phospholipases)', 'EC 3.1.4.11 (Phospholipase C beta)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide', 'Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'Isoenzymes/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Luminescent Proteins', 'NF-E2 Transcription Factor, p45 Subunit', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Phospholipase C beta', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Type C Phospholipases/*metabolism']",2002/05/29 10:00,2002/08/28 10:01,['2002/05/29 10:00'],"['2002/05/29 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/28 10:01 [medline]', '2002/05/29 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0167488902001921 [pii]', '10.1016/s0167-4889(02)00192-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 2002 May 8;1589(3):305-10. doi: 10.1016/s0167-4889(02)00192-1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of the present study was to develop a method for precise quantitation of gene expression in small subsets of highly purified CD34(+)CD38(-) stem cell populations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to quantitate housekeeping and drug resistance gene expression in cDNA obtained from 300 CD34(+)CD38(-) cells without cDNA amplification or nested PCR techniques. RESULTS: Validation experiments in cell lines showed efficient, representative and reproducible gene amplification using 300-cell real-time quantitative RT-PCR. Sensitivity was confirmed in dilutional experiments and by detection of the low-copy gene PBGD. GAPDH was found to be a useful reference gene in normal and leukemic CD34(+)CD38(-) cells. In contrast, 18S rRNA content varied 100-fold to 1000-fold in these populations. Moreover, expression of 18S rRNA was significantly lower in leukemic CD34(+)CD38(+) cells compared to normal CD34(+)CD38(+) cells (p = 0.002). Expression of MDR-1 (18-fold, p < 0.0005), MRP-1 (3.8-fold, p < 0.05), and LRP (1.8-fold, NS) was higher in normal CD34(+)CD38(-) compared to CD34(+)CD38(+) cells. CONCLUSIONS: Real-time quantitative RT-PCR is a valuable tool for precise quantitation of gene expression in small subsets of hematopoietic cells. Using this method, we showed the inappropriateness of 18S as a reference gene in these progenitors and the down-regulation of drug-resistance-related genes early in hematopoiesis.","['Raaijmakers, Marc H G P', 'van Emst, Liesbeth', 'de Witte, Theo', 'Mensink, Ewald', 'Raymakers, Reinier A P']","['Raaijmakers MH', 'van Emst L', 'de Witte T', 'Mensink E', 'Raymakers RA']","['Department of Hematology and Central Hematology Laboratory, University Medical Center Nijmegen, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.

MmTRA1b gene expression was increased during differentiation of human monoblastic leukemia U937 cells using some differentiation inducers but not 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) (a typical monocytic differentiation inducer). To further elucidate the role of human MmTRA1b gene expression in the differentiation of myelogenous leukemia cells, we measured MmTRA1b gene expression in several myeloid leukemia cell lines and primary leukemia cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The expression of MmTRA1b mRNA was determined by semiquantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Expression of the MmTRA1b gene was markedly induced during granulocytic differentiation of promyelocytic leukemia NB4 and HT93 cells induced by all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA). The level of MmTRA1b mRNA was significantly increased during differentiation toward granulocytes, but not monocytes/macrophages, in bipotential myeloid leukemia HL-60 cells. The level of MmTRA1 mRNA was not increased during erythroid differentiation induced by hemin in erythroid leukemia K562 and HEL cells or during megakaryocytic differentiation induced by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate in K562 cells. Expression of the MmTRA1b gene also was not induced when apoptosis of NB4 cells was induced by antileukemic drugs. ATRA-induced differentiation of antisense MmTRA1b-transfected NB4 cells was significantly suppressed. On the other hand, ATRA induced the differentiation of MmTRA1b-transfected NB4 cells more efficiently than that of mock-transfected cells. MmTRA1b mRNA also was clearly induced in ATRA-treated primary acute promyelocytic leukemia cells during granulocytic differentiation. CONCLUSION: MmTRA1b mRNA was specifically induced during granulocytic differentiation of acute promyelocytic leukemia cells and was associated with induction of their differentiation.","['Nakamaki, Tsuyoshi', 'Okabe-Kado, Junko', 'Yamamoto-Yamaguchi, Yuri', 'Hino, Ken ichiro', 'Tomoyasu, Shigeru', 'Honma, Yoshio', 'Kasukabe, Takashi']","['Nakamaki T', 'Okabe-Kado J', 'Yamamoto-Yamaguchi Y', 'Hino Ki', 'Tomoyasu S', 'Honma Y', 'Kasukabe T']","['Department of Hematology, Showa University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Phospholipid Transfer Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Ca(2+) Mg(2+)-ATPase)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']",IM,"['Ca(2+) Mg(2+)-ATPase/genetics', 'Calcitriol/pharmacology', 'Carrier Proteins/*genetics', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/*genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Granulocytes/*physiology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/pathology', 'Macrophages/cytology', 'Membrane Proteins/*genetics', 'Monocytes/cytology', '*Phospholipid Transfer Proteins', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'U937 Cells']",2002/05/29 10:00,2002/06/18 10:01,['2002/05/29 10:00'],"['2002/05/29 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/06/18 10:01 [medline]', '2002/05/29 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0301472X02007798 [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-472x(02)00779-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2002 May;30(5):421-9. doi: 10.1016/s0301-472x(02)00779-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Numerous reports in the literature have pointed out that cell-free DNA in plasma or serum has the clinical potential to be a more specific tumor marker for the diagnosis and prognosis, as well as the early detection, of cancer. METHODS: In order to adapt cell-free DNA to a routine clinical laboratory test, we used commercial kits such as the QIAamp blood kit for DNA extraction and the PicoGreen DNA kit for DNA quantification. This was done so our results and the normal reference value established would allow to be compared by other laboratories. We have established the normal reference level of cell-free DNA for females and males from age 20-70 years. We also detected elevated cell-free DNA in all cancers that were tested in this study, including carcinomas, leukemia and lymphoma. RESULTS: Our study indicates that the elevation of serum cell-free DNA was usually detected in specimens containing elevated tumor markers and is most likely associated with tumor metastases. The electrophoretic pattern of cell-free DNA showed that cell-free DNA from cancer patient is fragmented, containing smaller DNA (100 bp) not found in normal cell-free DNA.

Calcineurin and calmodulin contents were also determined by ELISA employing monoclonal antibodies specific to the proteins. RESULTS: The activity of calcineurin was decreased by 75% and 85% in sera of patients diagnosed either for acute lymphoid leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia, respectively, without apparent changes in calmodulin or calcineurin contents under both these conditions. In addition, the decreased calcineurin activity in acute myeloid leukemia was restored to levels comparable to non-leukemic individuals upon treatment. This was not observed in cases of acute lymphoid leukemia. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest diagnostic utility in the measurement of serum calcineurin activity in acute leukemia.

The promoter of RpL6/Taxreb107 contains recognition sites for multiple transcription factors including nuclear factor (NF)-kappa B. Luciferase reporter assay showed that the RpL6/Taxreb107 promoter has a constitutive activity in transfected cells, and the constitutive activity depends on the intact promoter. Expression of HTLV-I viral protein Tax mildly but reproducibly induced RpL6/Taxreb107 mRNA and promoter activity. We provide evidence suggesting that induction of RpL6/Taxreb107 by Tax is at least partially mediated by the NF-kappa B site in the promoter of RpL6/Taxreb107. Taken together, Tax up-regulates RpL6/Taxreb107 and this may provide a feedback mechanism to facilitate proliferation of HTLV-I-infected cells and production of viral particles.","['Wang, Jishu', 'Yang, Xi', 'Zhou, Peng', 'Han, Hua']","['Wang J', 'Yang X', 'Zhou P', 'Han H']","[""Department of Medical Genetics and Developmental Biology, The Fourth Military Medical University, Xian 710032, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Ribosomal Proteins)', '0 (ribosomal protein L6)', '0 (tax-responsive-element-binding protein 107, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'COS Cells', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Complementary/biosynthesis/chemistry', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism', 'Embryo, Mammalian/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Gene Products, tax/metabolism', 'Mice', 'NF-kappa B/chemistry/metabolism', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Ribosomal Proteins/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism', 'Transfection']",2002/05/29 10:00,2002/09/21 10:01,['2002/05/29 10:00'],"['2002/05/29 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/21 10:01 [medline]', '2002/05/29 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0167478102003408 [pii]', '10.1016/s0167-4781(02)00340-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 2002 Jun 7;1576(1-2):219-24. doi: 10.1016/s0167-4781(02)00340-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, if the population of infused cells is to be limited to transduced cells, a means of positive selection is required. We describe a clinical scale procedure for activation of donor T cells with anti-CD3/CD28 beads followed by transduction with a retroviral construct expressing the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV-tk) and human nerve growth factor receptor (NGFR). Optimization of transduction parameters was performed, testing the timing of transduction, centrifugation, and the use of serum. In large-scale experiments, 3-5 x 10(8) peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were activated with anti-CD3/CD28 beads and expanded to day 13. Transduction was accomplished using MFG-TKiNG supernatant produced from the PG13 packaging line 48 hr after T-cell activation. The mean transduction frequency was 37.5% based on NGFR expression, and the mean expansion observed was 42.6-fold (mean final cell number 1.85 x 10(10)). A comparison of the ability of the Baxter Isolex 300i and the Miltenyi CliniMACS to perform purification of NGFR+ cells suggests that greater purity can be achieved with the CliniMACS device (67.4% vs. 97.7%), while the yield of transduced cells appears higher with the Isolex 300i (41.3% vs. 23.5%). We conclude that a strategy based on activation of human T cells with anti-CD3/CD28 beads can result in sufficient transduction, expansion, and purification based on NGFR expression for clinical trials.","['Orchard, Paul J', 'Blazar, Bruce R', 'Burger, Scott', 'Levine, Bruce', 'Basso, Lisa', 'Nelson, David M K', 'Gordon, Keith', 'McIvor, R Scott', 'Wagner, John E', 'Miller, Jeffrey S']","['Orchard PJ', 'Blazar BR', 'Burger S', 'Levine B', 'Basso L', 'Nelson DM', 'Gordon K', 'McIvor RS', 'Wagner JE', 'Miller JS']","['Program in Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Department of Pediatrics, Institute of Human Genetics, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA. orcha001@maroon.tc.umn.edu']",['eng'],['R01 CA72669/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Hum Gene Ther,Human gene therapy,9008950,"['0 (CD28 Antigens)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (Receptor, Nerve Growth Factor)', 'EC 2.7.1.21 (Thymidine Kinase)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'CD28 Antigens/*immunology', 'CD3 Complex/*immunology', 'Centrifugation', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Leukemia Virus, Gibbon Ape/genetics', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Magnetics', 'Mice', 'Microspheres', 'Receptor, Nerve Growth Factor/*genetics/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/metabolism', 'Thymidine Kinase/*genetics/metabolism', '*Transduction, Genetic']",2002/05/29 10:00,2002/12/05 04:00,['2002/05/29 10:00'],"['2002/05/29 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/05 04:00 [medline]', '2002/05/29 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/10430340252939087 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Gene Ther. 2002 May 20;13(8):979-88. doi: 10.1089/10430340252939087.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Three animals were transplanted with GFP-selected (GS) CD34-enriched marrow. To ensure engraftment, preselected GFP-positive cells were infused together with unselected neo-transduced cells. After transduction on fibronectin, cells were cultured for an additional 2 days to allow for expression of GFP. GFP-expressing cells were enriched by fluorescence-activated cell sorting and infused together with cells from the unselected fractions after myeloablative irradiation of the recipient. Three other animals were transplanted with GFP-transduced CD34-enriched cells without prior GFP selection (GU). At 4 weeks after transplant, the percentage of GFP-expressing white blood cells was significantly higher in the GS group (6.6%) than in the GU group (1.3%) (p < 0.002). The higher gene transfer levels in the animals transplanted with GS cells gradually declined, and by day 100 after transplant, gene transfer levels were similar in both groups. PCR analysis performed on genomic DNA isolated from peripheral blood cells demonstrated that the decline in GFP-positive cells was due to the loss of gene-marked cells and not due to loss of expression. These results show that transplantation of CD34-positive marrow cells selected for GFP-positive cells after transduction provides high levels of transduced granulocytes in the short term. However, using this experimental design with concomitant infusion of unselected cells and the use of oncoretroviral vectors, preenrichment of vector-expressing, transduced CD34-enriched cells does not improve long-term persistence and expression.","['Kiem, Hans-Peter', 'Rasko, John E J', 'Morris, Julia', 'Peterson, Laura', 'Kurre, Peter', 'Andrews, Robert G']","['Kiem HP', 'Rasko JE', 'Morris J', 'Peterson L', 'Kurre P', 'Andrews RG']","['Division of Clinical Research, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA 98109, USA. hkiem@fhcrc.org']",['eng'],"['N01 AI35191/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA15704/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 DK47754/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 HL54881/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'RROO166/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Hum Gene Ther,Human gene therapy,9008950,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/*genetics', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genetic Therapy/methods', 'Genetic Vectors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Gibbon Ape/genetics/*metabolism', 'Luminescent Proteins/blood/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Papio', '*Transduction, Genetic']",2002/05/29 10:00,2002/12/05 04:00,['2002/05/29 10:00'],"['2002/05/29 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/05 04:00 [medline]', '2002/05/29 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/10430340252939005 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Gene Ther. 2002 May 20;13(8):891-9. doi: 10.1089/10430340252939005.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The medical records of 14 children who fulfilled the International Juvenile Myelomonocytic Leukaemia Working Group Criteria for a diagnosis of juvenile myelomonocytic leukaemia (JMML) presenting to a single institution were reviewed, and their clinical status at September 2000 was documented. RESULTS: The most common presenting features were hepatosplenomegaly and lymphadenopathy. Fifty per cent of cases presented in the first year of life. Nine of 14 patients initially received chemotherapy otherwise used in the treatment of acute myeloid or lymphoblastic leukaemia with no apparent benefit. All six patients who received conditioning therapy with chemotherapy alone, followed by allogeneic bone marrow transplant (BMT), are in complete remission at a median follow-up duration of 12 months (range 5-91 months). Five of six patients surviving post-allogeneic BMT received marrow from an unrelated donor. Only one of seven patients who did not receive BMT survived long-term. CONCLUSION: Children with a diagnosis of JMML should be treated with allogeneic BMT as soon as a suitable donor is found.

STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Studies that specifically addressed the areas of major concern or advancement in viral safety of IVIGs, including donor selection, plasma screening, and other quality control procedures to ensure safety of source plasma; detection of viruses that may have escaped antibody screening tests through the use of polymerase chain reaction-based assays, which are capable of detecting small amounts of viral genomic material (e.g., hepatitis C virus, hepatitis B virus, and human immunodeficiency virus [HIV]) in small plasma pools; and industrial-scale, validated viral inactivation methods, such as pasteurization and solvent/detergent treatment, that have been incorporated into the manufacturing processes of immunoglobulins to further minimize the risk of viral transmission. DATA SYNTHESIS: In addition to the treatment of primary immunodeficiency disorders, the clinical uses of IVIGs have expanded to include treatment of Kawasaki's syndrome, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, infection following bone marrow transplantation, secondary immunologic disorders (e.g., pediatric HIV infection), hematologic disorders (e.g., chronic lymphocytic leukemia), and neurologic indications (e.g., Guillain-Barre syndrome).

Recently, it has been reported that the extracellular cleavage of GSH by GGT induced the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), suggesting that GGT plays a pro-oxidant role. In the present study, we investigated the nature of the oxidative stress generate by glutathione and GGT and the possibility that this stress affects the activity of NF-kappaB a prototypical oxidant-stress-responsive transcription factor. We found that, in the presence of iron, a natural substrate of GGT, glutathione induces lipid peroxidation in U937 cells. This induction depends on GGT activity as it is prevented by the Serine/Borate complex, a GGT inhibitor. We found that y-glutamyl transpeptidase activity induces NF-kappaB DNA binding activity, an effect which is significantly reduced by the addition of GGT inhibitors (Serine/Borate complex and Acivicin). Moreover, we show that lipid peroxidation is involved in GGT-dependent NF-kappaB activation since vitamin E, which completely inhibits GGT-induced generation of lipid peroxides, prevents the GGT-dependent NF-kappaB activation. Finally, inhibition of GGT by either the Serine/Borate complex or by Acivicin resulted in cell apoptosis. This finding suggests that GGT-mediated NF-kappaB activation plays a role in the control of apoptosis in U937 cells.","['Djavaheri-Mergny, Mojgan', 'Accaoui, Marie-Jose', 'Rouillard, Dany', 'Wietzerbin, Juana']","['Djavaheri-Mergny M', 'Accaoui MJ', 'Rouillard D', 'Wietzerbin J']","['INSERM U365, Institut Curie, Section de recherche, Paris, France.

Conditioning regimens affect relapse rate and treatment-related mortality. We evaluated biodistribution, radiation absorbed organ doses and immediate toxicities of myeloablative radioimmunotherapy with marrow selective 188rhenium (188Re)-labeled anti-CD66 monoclonal antibody (mAb). METHODS: Fifty high-risk leukemia patients were treated 14 +/- 2 days prior to SCT. Dosimetric measurements were performed at 1.5, 3, 20, 26, and 44 hours after about 1 GBq of 188Re followed by radioimmunotherapy with about 10 GBq 188Re. Standard conditioning consisted of high-dose chemotherapy and 12 Gy total-body irradiation. Forty-six patients received allogenic, and four received autologous, stem cell grafts. RESULTS: The mean radiation absorbed doses (in Gy) were: marrow, 13.9 +/- 4.6; liver, 5.7 +/- 2.7; spleen, 22.6 +/- 25.5; kidneys, 6.8 +/- 2.6; lungs, 0.8 +/- 0.7; total body, 1.4 +/- 0.3. The tumor-to-organ-ratios were 2.4 for liver, 0.6 for the spleen, 2.0 for the kidneys and 17.8 for the lungs. Type of leukemia did not affect radiation absorbed doses of marrow, lungs, kidneys and liver. Mean marrow dose of transplanted patients in complete remission was 1.37 +/- 0.43 Gy/GBq, compared with 1.34 +/- 0.29 Gy/GBq for patients with leukemic blast marrow infiltration of 5-25%. Immediate side effects were moderate. All patients showed primary engraftment. After a median follow-up of 11.0 +/- 7.4 months 28/50 patients (56%) are in ongoing complete remission. Nine patients (5%) have relapsed, seven (4%) of them have died. Another 13 patients (7%) died of treatment-related causes. CONCLUSIONS: Due to its biodistribution, radiation absorbed organ doses, low toxicity and clinical data, myeloablative radioimmunotherapy with 188Re-labeled anti-CD66 mAb seems to be a promising method for improving standard conditioning of high-risk leukemia patients prior to SCT.","['Buchmann, Inga', 'Bunjes, Donald', 'Kotzerke, Jorg', 'Martin, Hans', 'Glatting, Gerhard', 'Seitz, Ulrike', 'Rattat, Dirk', 'Buck, Andreas', 'Dohner, Hartmut', 'Reske, Sven N']","['Buchmann I', 'Bunjes D', 'Kotzerke J', 'Martin H', 'Glatting G', 'Seitz U', 'Rattat D', 'Buck A', 'Dohner H', 'Reske SN']","['Department of Nuclear Medicine, University Hospital, Ulm, Germany. inga.buchmann@medizin.uni-ulm.de']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Biother Radiopharm,Cancer biotherapy & radiopharmaceuticals,9605408,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (CD66 antigens)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Radioisotopes)', '7440-15-5 (Rhenium)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Antigens, CD/*immunology', 'Antigens, Differentiation/*immunology', 'Bone Marrow/immunology/radiation effects', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/diagnostic imaging/*metabolism/*therapy', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnostic imaging/metabolism/therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/diagnostic imaging/metabolism/therapy', 'Liver/metabolism/radiation effects', 'Lung/metabolism/radiation effects', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnostic imaging/metabolism/therapy', 'Radiation Dosage', '*Radioimmunotherapy', 'Radioisotopes/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Radionuclide Imaging', 'Rhenium/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Survival Rate', 'Tissue Distribution', '*Transplantation Conditioning']",2002/05/28 10:00,2002/12/10 04:00,['2002/05/28 10:00'],"['2002/05/28 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/10 04:00 [medline]', '2002/05/28 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/108497802753773775 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Biother Radiopharm. 2002 Apr;17(2):151-63. doi: 10.1089/108497802753773775.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Childhood leukemias are complicated more frequently by leukemic arthritis (LA) than adult cases. LA occurs rather in acute than in chronic leukemia and can present at any stage of the disease. Proposed pathogenic mechanisms of arthritis in leukemia are leukemic infiltration of synovial tissue and resulting periosteal and capsular inflammation. As the primary manifestation of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and immunocytoma (IC), LA is extremely rare. In such cases osteoarthritis may then be misdiagnosed as the source of joint disease. METHOD: We report a case of glenohumeral arthritis with complete rotator cuff tear and humeral head migration in an 88-year-old patient. Surgery exposed joint effusion, synovitis and chondromalacia with glenohumeral joint destruction. RESULTS: Histopathological examination revealed an articular chondrocalcinosis and bone marrow infiltration by an immunocytoma (B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma of low malignancy). CONCLUSION: Although LA is an uncommon complication in CLL and IC, it may be considered in elderly patients with lymphocytosis and arthritis.","['Braune, C', 'Rittmeister, M', 'Engels, K', 'Kerschbaumer, F']","['Braune C', 'Rittmeister M', 'Engels K', 'Kerschbaumer F']","['Abteilung fur Rheumaorthopadie der Johann-Wolfgang-Goethe-Universitat Frankfurt, Germany.']",['ger'],,"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Z Orthop Ihre Grenzgeb,Zeitschrift fur Orthopadie und ihre Grenzgebiete,1256465,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Arthritis/pathology/*surgery', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Bone Neoplasms/pathology/*surgery', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/pathology/*surgery', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/pathology/*surgery', 'Shoulder Impingement Syndrome/pathology/surgery', 'Shoulder Joint/pathology/*surgery']",2002/05/25 10:00,2002/08/29 10:01,['2002/05/25 10:00'],"['2002/05/25 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/29 10:01 [medline]', '2002/05/25 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1055/s-2002-31541 [doi]'],ppublish,Z Orthop Ihre Grenzgeb. 2002 Mar-Apr;140(2):199-202. doi: 10.1055/s-2002-31541.,,,,,Erstdiagnose eines niedrig malignen Non-Hodgkin-Lymphoms (Immunozytom) bei Arthritis des Glenohumeralgelenks.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Molecular remissions have been observed occasionally after high-dose chemotherapy. Thus, new improved techniques to monitor residual tumor cells on a molecular basis in CLL are warranted. For this purpose, a real-time quantitative allele-specific oligonucleotide polymerase chain reaction (ASO-PCR) for patients with B-CLL was designed. In the present study, the PCR assay was standardized with identical cycling parameters as well as primer, probe, and MgCl(2) concentration for each patient. Ten patients were monitored with DNA samples obtained at 52 time points (median: 5.2 per patient). The median follow-up per patient was 11.4 months. Nine of ten patients had PCR-detectable residual tumor cells in the peripheral blood after therapy. One patient became PCR negative with a combination of fludarabine and rituximab after the end of treatment. The MRD levels in patients with detectable disease ranged from 0.002% to 10.1% after therapy.

Although Candida albicans and Aspergillusspp. continue to be the main pathogens, the proportion of patients infected by non-albicans species of Candida and other yeasts and by other filamentous fungi is rising in most institutions. Risk factors for the various IFI differ, and it is thus of utmost importance to realize that not all patients are the same with respect to the risk for developing the various IFI. Recent advances in diagnosis now allow the use of very sensitive imaging techniques with an extremely low negative predictive value. Among the novel microbiologic methods, the galactomannan antigen test is now commercially available for routine use in the diagnosis of aspergillosis, while DNA fungal detection is still experimental. For the first time, clinicians now have a broad range of antifungals to chose from, with special emphasis on amphotericin B preparations, novel broad-spectrum azoles, and the echinocandins.

METHODS: The cytotoxic effect of bendamustine was measured by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5 diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT)-dye reduction assay. Induction of apoptosis was evidenced by DNA gel electrophoresis, nuclear staining, Western blot poly-(adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage, and flow cytometry. As a measure of hematological toxicity, the formation of chromosomal aberrations was investigated in bone marrow cells isolated from mice treated with low non-toxic doses of bendamustine and lomustine. RESULTS: Bendamustine was preferably active against leukemic cells of lymphoid origin and was found to induce apoptosis in SKW-3 and BV-173 cells as shown by oligonucleosomal DNA and nuclear fragmentation, PARP cleavage, and formation of a sub-G1 fraction. Myeloid and breast carcinoma cell lines were resistant towards bendamustine with the exception of HL-60 cells which exhibit an intermediate sensitivity. Bendamustine was found to have a very low clastogenic effect as compared with equimolar doses of lomustine. CONCLUSION: Taken together, the mode of action of bendamustine includes induction of apoptosis. The specific spectrum of activity and the unexpectedly low clastogenicity support the hypothesis that bendamustine in not a typical alkylating agent but exerts an additional mode of action, possibly as a purine antimetabolite.","['Konstantinov, S M', 'Kostovski, A', 'Topashka-Ancheva, M', 'Genova, M', 'Berger, M R']","['Konstantinov SM', 'Kostovski A', 'Topashka-Ancheva M', 'Genova M', 'Berger MR']","['Lab. for Experimental Chemotherapy, Dept. of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Faculty of Phamacy at the Medical University of Sofia, 2 Dunav St., 1000 Sofia, Bulgaria.

XAF1 mRNA was up-regulated by IFN-alpha and IFN-beta in all cells examined. However, IFNs induced high levels of XAF1 protein predominantly in cell lines sensitive to the proapoptotic effects of IFN-beta. In apoptosis-resistant cells including WM164 melanoma, WM35 melanoma, U937 pro-monocytic leukemia, and HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells, XAF1 mRNA was strongly up-regulated but XAF1 protein was up-regulated only weakly or not at all. Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) is a critical mediator of IFN-beta-induced apoptosis, but most melanoma cell lines were resistant to recombinant TRAIL protein. For example, A375 melanoma cells were defective in TRAIL induction by IFN-beta and were resistant to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. However, IFN-beta pretreatment sensitized them to subsequent recombinant TRAIL-induced apoptosis. A375 cells expressing XAF1 constitutively were more sensitive to TRAIL-induced apoptosis compared with empty vector-transfected cells. The degree of sensitization by XAF1 was similar to that provided by IFN pretreatment and was correlated with the level of XAF1 expressed. Furthermore, the overexpression of the zinc-finger portion of XAF1 blocked IFN-dependent sensitization of A375 melanoma cells to the proapoptotic effects of TRAIL. These results suggested that IFN-dependent induction of XAF1 strongly influenced cellular sensitivity to the proapoptotic actions of TRAIL.","['Leaman, Douglas W', 'Chawla-Sarkar, Mamta', 'Vyas, Keyur', 'Reheman, Monila', 'Tamai, Katsuyuki', 'Toji, Singo', 'Borden, Ernest C']","['Leaman DW', 'Chawla-Sarkar M', 'Vyas K', 'Reheman M', 'Tamai K', 'Toji S', 'Borden EC']","['Department of Biological Sciences, University of Toledo, Toledo, Ohio 43606, USA. dleaman@utnet.utoledo.edu']",['eng'],"['1R01CA90837/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA90914/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNFSF10 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (XAF1 protein, human)', '77238-31-4 (Interferon-beta)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', '*Apoptosis', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Separation', 'DNA, Complementary/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Interferon-beta/*metabolism', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Ligands', 'Melanoma/metabolism', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*chemistry', 'Plasmids/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Subcellular Fractions/metabolism', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand', 'Time Factors', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*metabolism', 'U937 Cells', 'Up-Regulation', 'Zinc Fingers']",2002/05/25 10:00,2002/09/11 10:01,['2002/05/25 10:00'],"['2002/05/25 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/11 10:01 [medline]', '2002/05/25 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M204851200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(20)70244-9 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2002 Aug 9;277(32):28504-11. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M204851200.

We developed a quantitative reverse transcription (RT)-PCR method for multidrug resistance 1 (MDR1) and multidrug resistance-related protein 1 (MRP1) transcripts to evaluate drug resistance, and applied it to clinical samples. METHODS: The cutoffs for copy numbers of MDR1 and MRP1 transcripts were defined based on copy numbers in healthy bone marrow mononuclear cells. To confirm that the cutoffs reflected biological resistance, we established vincristine (VCR)-resistant K562 sublines that showed various degrees of drug resistance and examined the correlation between the copy numbers of these transcripts and the biological resistance of these clones. In addition, we compared the sensitivity and specificity of quantitative RT-PCR to a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and flow cytometric (FCM) analysis. RESULTS: The defined cutoff for copy numbers of MDR1 transcripts corresponded with the degree of biological resistance of VCR-resistant K562 sublines. Clinical study revealed that the concentrations of MDR1 mRNA in all relapsed patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) were above the cutoff. Moreover, both AML and acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients with high MDR1 mRNA expression at diagnosis tended to show a low remission rate and short remission periods. No association was observed between the amounts of MRP1 transcripts and clinical outcomes. The specificity and sensitivity of quantitative RT-PCR for MDR1 were superior to the MTT assay and FCM analysis. CONCLUSION: These results suggest the efficacy of this quantitative analysis of MDR1 transcripts for the prediction of clinical drug resistance in acute leukemia.","['Fujimaki, Shin-ichi', 'Funato, Tadao', 'Harigae, Hideo', 'Fujiwara, Junko', 'Kameoka, Junichi', 'Meguro, Kuniaki', 'Kaku, Mitsuo', 'Sasaki, Takeshi']","['Fujimaki S', 'Funato T', 'Harigae H', 'Fujiwara J', 'Kameoka J', 'Meguro K', 'Kaku M', 'Sasaki T']","['Division of Molecular Diagnostics, Department of Clinical Medicine, Tohoku University School of Medicine, Seiryoumachi 1-1, Aoba-ku, Sendai 980-8574, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Clin Chem,Clinical chemistry,9421549,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins)', 'Y49M64GZ4Q (multidrug resistance-associated protein 1)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*genetics/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', 'Phenotype', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/05/25 10:00,2002/06/18 10:01,['2002/05/25 10:00'],"['2002/05/25 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/06/18 10:01 [medline]', '2002/05/25 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Chem. 2002 Jun;48(6 Pt 1):811-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The cancer incidence and cause-specific mortality of 3,673 physicians (870 M, 2,803 F) in Estonia was compared with the rates of the general population. Information on cancer cases and deaths in the cohort between 1983 and 1998 was obtained from the Estonian Cancer Registry and the mortality database of Estonia. RESULTS: The standardized incidence ratio (SIR) for all cancers was 1.32 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.15-1.48) in women and 0.92 (95% CI 0.73-1.13) in men. Female physicians had an elevated risk for breast cancer (SIR 2.03, 95% CI 1.62-2.51) and myeloid leukaemia (SIR 3.69, 95% CI 1.35-8.02). Male physicians had an excess of skin melanoma (SIR 4.88, 95% CI 1.58-11.38). A large deficit of lung cancer was observed (SIR 0.24, 95% CI 0.11-0.48). The very low all-cause mortality in the cohort (standardized mortality ratio 0.55, 95% CI 0.50-0.61) was mainly due to large deficits in deaths from lung cancer, cardiovascular diseases and external causes. The suicide rate in the cohort was lower than in the general population. CONCLUSIONS: No health risks were observed in the cohort that could be linked to the occupational exposures of physicians. The pattern of cancer incidence and mortality seen in physicians in Estonia is similar to the pattern seen among professional classes in other countries.","['Innos, Kaire', 'Rahu, Kaja', 'Baburin, Aleksei', 'Rahu, Mati']","['Innos K', 'Rahu K', 'Baburin A', 'Rahu M']","['Institute of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, Tallinn, Estonia.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Sweden,Scand J Public Health,Scandinavian journal of public health,100883503,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', '*Cause of Death', 'Cohort Studies', 'Estonia/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice', 'Humans', 'Incidence', '*Life Style', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/mortality', 'Occupational Exposure', 'Physicians/*psychology', 'Physicians, Women/psychology', 'Risk Factors', 'Smoking/adverse effects']",2002/05/25 10:00,2002/07/26 10:01,['2002/05/25 10:00'],"['2002/05/25 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/07/26 10:01 [medline]', '2002/05/25 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/14034940210133735 [doi]'],ppublish,Scand J Public Health. 2002;30(2):133-40. doi: 10.1080/14034940210133735.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Such modification might confer onto antigen-presenting cells the ability to stimulate expansion of effector cells. METHODS: To quantify the infection efficiency of CML dendritic cells (CML-DC) by recombinant adenovirus, we measured the expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene contained in the virus. In CML-DC infected with an adenovirus containing the IL-2 gene, we evaluated their ability to secrete IL-2 and stimulate proliferation of autologous T cells. RESULTS: Uninfected CML-DC and normal DC secreted similar amounts of IL-12 and stimulated similarly efficient autologous mixed leukocyte reaction. Immature CML-DC infected by an adenovirus containing the gene for IL-2 secreted large amounts of IL-2 and stimulated proliferation of autologous T cells more efficiently than the corresponding CML-DC alone. High levels of interferon eta, but not of IL-4, in cell culture supernates indicated that the proliferating cells were T(H)1. Infected mature CML-DC were more effective than infected immature CML-DC, showing that T cell stimulation by mature DC and by IL-2 was additive. DISCUSSION: CML-DC can be modified genetically and functionally by recombinant replication-defective adenoviruses, providing new possibilities for clinical trials in dendritic cell-based immunotherapy.","['Dietz, A B', 'Litzow, M R', 'Bulur, P A', 'Vuk-Pavlovic, S']","['Dietz AB', 'Litzow MR', 'Bulur PA', 'Vuk-Pavlovic S']","['Stem Cell Laboratory, Mayo Clinic Cancer Center, Rochester, MN 55905, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cytotherapy,Cytotherapy,100895309,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Adenoviridae', 'Antigen Presentation', 'Dendritic Cells/*immunology/metabolism', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Immunotherapy/*methods', 'Interferon-gamma/metabolism', 'Interleukin-2/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/immunology/metabolism/*therapy', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'Th1 Cells/*immunology/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/05/25 10:00,2002/06/20 10:01,['2002/05/25 10:00'],"['2002/05/25 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/06/20 10:01 [medline]', '2002/05/25 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1080/14653240152584505 [doi]', 'S1465-3249(01)70969-3 [pii]']",ppublish,Cytotherapy. 2001;3(2):97-105. doi: 10.1080/14653240152584505.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Differentiation requires induction of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 (WAF1/CIP1), and cell cycle arrest at the G1/S checkpoint. With iron depletion, p21 induction and differentiation are blocked. To establish the roles of iron and p21 in normal monocyte/macrophage differentiation, we examined generation of dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages from peripheral monocytes. Monocytes were cultured with interleukin 4 and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), then treated with lipopolysaccharide to produce DCs or with M-CSF to produce macrophages. Iron deprivation was induced by desferrioxamine (DF). Monocyte-derived DCs had characteristic phenotype and morphology, and stimulated proliferation of naive allogeneic T lymphocytes. In contrast, DCs generated under iron deprivation were phenotypically undifferentiated and did not stimulate T cells. Similarly, macrophages expressed a characteristic phenotype and morphology, and phagocytosed latex beads, but macrophages generated under iron deprivation failed to develop a mature phenotype and had impaired phagocytosis.

To identify factors contributing to this risk, we reviewed the records of 317 consecutive, paediatric, allogeneic bone marrow transplant recipients at a single institution. The 6-year estimated cumulative incidence of platelet refractoriness due to HLA alloimmunization was 2.6% +/- 0.9%. The incidence among patients with chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML) 12.5% +/- 5.3% was significantly greater than that of other patients (1.1% +/- 0.6%, P < 0.001). Graft rejection (P = 0.003) and the number of platelet transfusions during the first 90 d after bone marrow transplantation (BMT) (P = 0.0025) were also significantly associated with alloimmunization. The association with CML and with graft rejection was not seen among patients alloimmunized before transplantation. Eight patients developed alloimmunization, of whom three had mismatched grafts and four had unrelated grafts. Alloantibody specificities, identified in seven patients, were unrelated to host or graft major histocompatibility complex (MHC). Host recognition of alloantigens in transfused blood products, not graft-host recognition, therefore seems predominantly responsible for the alloimmunization. These results show that paediatric CML patients have a significantly increased risk of platelet refractoriness due to HLA alloimmunization after BMT. Identifying the mechanism for the increased alloimmunization risk may assist in the development of therapies to prevent platelet refractoriness.","['Geiger, Terrence L', 'Woodard, Paul', 'Tong, Xin', 'Srivastava, Deo Kumar', 'Johnson, Robyn', 'Turner, Victoria', 'Hale, Gregory', 'Richardson, Stacye']","['Geiger TL', 'Woodard P', 'Tong X', 'Srivastava DK', 'Johnson R', 'Turner V', 'Hale G', 'Richardson S']","[""Department of Pathology, Mail Stop 341, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, 132 North Lauderdale Street, Memphis, TN 38105-2794, USA. terrence.geiger@stjude.org""]",['eng'],['CA 21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (Isoantibodies)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*immunology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Erythrocyte Transfusion', 'Graft Rejection', 'HLA Antigens/*immunology', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Isoantibodies/*blood', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*immunology', 'Platelet Transfusion', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors']",2002/05/25 10:00,2002/07/13 10:01,['2002/05/25 10:00'],"['2002/05/25 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/07/13 10:01 [medline]', '2002/05/25 10:00 [entrez]']","['3465 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2002.03465.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2002 Jun;117(3):634-41. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2002.03465.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In accordance with this model, downregulation of c-Abl and Bcr-Abl has been observed during differentiation in different systems, although the mechanism is still largely unknown. To investigate the relationship between erythroid differentiation and c-Abl and Bcr-Abl levels, we induced differentiation in K562 cells using a temperature-inducible p53 mutant (p53Val1335). It was found that p53-induced erythroid differentiation in K562 cells required caspase activity.

This was compared with the sensitivity to other anthracyclines (0.5 microg/ml), using the fluorometric microculture cytotoxicity assay. A total of 132 samples from patients with acute leukaemia and a cell-line panel representing different resistance mechanisms was included for comparison. The median cell survival of L-NHL cells did not differ after exposing the cells to Ida or daunorubicin (Dnr), whereas epirubicin, doxorubicin (Dox) and mitoxantrone (Mitox) were significantly less cytotoxic than Ida (P < 0.001). The median cell survival in L-NHL cells did not differ from that of acute leukaemia cells after exposure to 0.5 microg/ml Ida, Dnr, Dox and Mitox. Cells from previously treated patients with L-NHL had a higher median survival than cells from untreated patients after exposure to all drugs, except for Ida. In samples from previously untreated patients, Spearman rank correlations were high (Rho = 0.81-0.90) between cell survival after exposure to Ida and the other anthracyclines. The same pattern was observed in the cell-line panel (Rho = 0.78-0.91) (P < 0.05). In contrast, low correlations (Rho = 0.24-0.42) were observed among samples from previously treated patients.

Thirteen out of 17 patients with wild-type p15 gene showed expression of p15 mRNA, whereas 31 out of 39 patients with alteration (deletion and methylation) of the p15 gene showed no p15 mRNA expression by reverse transcription-PCR, suggesting that alterations of the p15 gene are highly associated with loss of p15 mRNA expression. Disease-free survival (DFS) at 4 years in patients with wild-type p15 gene is 33%, compared with 4% of those with p15 gene alterations (P = 0.049). Multivariate analysis showed that the absence of p15 gene alterations was an independent significant favourable prognostic factor for longer DFS (P = 0.0001).

Among the 117 patients reviewed, acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) was more frequent (64%) than acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL, 21%). Most patients had a high leukaemic cell load with hepatosplenomegaly, leukaemia cutis and hyperleucocytosis. Cytogenetic abnormalities were found in the majority of the patients tested (72%); 11q23 abnormalities were found in less than half of them (42%). The probability of overall survival at 24 months was only 23%. When congenital AML and ALL were compared, clinical characteristics and overall survival were not significantly different. However, in patients at risk, the probability of event-free survival (EFS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were significantly higher in AML than in ALL, 43% versus 13% and 68% versus 0% respectively. Among the congenital AML cases, six spontaneous remissions have been described. In conclusion, the clinical characteristics of congenital leukaemia differ from those of leukaemia in older children and prognosis is generally poor.

Its production reaches a maximum within 20 h, and thereafter is maintained at an almost constant level. The differentiated cells show phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-stimulated NADPH oxidase activity consistent with the amount of gp91phox (phagocytic oxidase) expressed in the plasma membrane. Three isoforms of p21-activated serine/threonine kinases, PAK68, PAK65 and PAK62, were found in both cytosolic and membrane fractions, and their contents were significantly increased during induced differentiation. The amount of Rac identified in the two fractions was also markedly enhanced by ATRA- induced differentiation. In contrast, neither PAK nor Rac was seen in the plasma membrane of undifferentiated HL-60 or human neutrophil, but they were abundant in the cytoplasmic fraction.

These two types of mitosis are regulated by mechanisms involving maturation and duplication factors, and each plays a role in the antagonistic histological development of the other.According to this theory, every kind of leukocyte is produced through mitosis in the bone marrow and migrates during cell turnover to the bloodstream. However, in leukemia a highly excessive number of leukocytes and leuko-blastocysts appear in the bloodstream. This excessive amount is greater than the physiological capability of cells in the bone marrow alone. Such an extremely large group of cells would not be produced without being dependent on an extremely high ratio of produced leukocytes to original stem cells. This extremely high ratio may be due to a systematic pathological deterioration of the mitotic maturation ability during the maturation process of the leuko-blastocysts. Consequently, restoration of the deterioration to the original mitotic maturation response of the normal leuko-blastocysts may be an essential event in achieving leukemia eradication, rather than persistent destruction of individual leukemic leukocytes.","['Hirata, Y', 'Hirata, S']","['Hirata Y', 'Hirata S']","['Hirata Hospital, Kochi, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Med Hypotheses,Medical hypotheses,7505668,,IM,"['Blast Crisis/pathology', 'Blood Cells/pathology', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Movement', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*pathology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*etiology', 'Leukocyte Count', '*Mitosis', '*Models, Biological', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/pathology']",2002/05/25 10:00,2003/01/31 04:00,['2002/05/25 10:00'],"['2002/05/25 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/31 04:00 [medline]', '2002/05/25 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1054/mehy.2001.1341 [doi]', 'S0306987701913416 [pii]']",ppublish,Med Hypotheses. 2002 Apr;58(4):251-3. doi: 10.1054/mehy.2001.1341.,,,,,,,,,['Copyright 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Treatments for cancer are intensive and difficult to endure. Distraction interventions are effective because the individual concentrates on pleasant or interesting stimuli instead of focusing on unpleasant symptoms. VR is a computer-simulated technique allowing an individual to hear and feel stimuli that correspond with a visual image. Evaluation of the VR intervention demonstrated positive outcomes. Eighty-two percent of the children (n = 11) indicated the chemotherapy treatment with the VR was better than previous chemotherapy treatments. All subjects responded positively when asked if they would like to use the VR again. The intervention was easy to implement, did not require practice to be effective, and required minimal nursing time. Results from this pilot study suggest that VR as a distraction intervention has the potential to enhance positive clinical outcomes.

Risk factors for catheter-related phlebitis were assessed at a single tertiary-care institution where no routine change policy for peripheral intravenous catheters is in place. METHODS: In a nonrandomized, observational trial, peripheral intravenous Teflon catheters were inserted in patients with a diagnosis of leukemia, lymphoma, solid tumor, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, other serious infection, or autoimmune disorder. Underlying disease, age, white blood cell count at the time of insertion, physician placing the catheter, catheter bore, duration of cannulation, reason for removal of the catheter, and visual inspection of the insertion site were recorded. RESULTS: Four hundred twelve catheters were inserted in 175 patients. The number of catheterizations per episode varied between 1 and 7. Three hundred sixty-four (88.3%) catheter placements were evaluable. The mean duration of cannulation was 4.2 days. The overall incidence of phlebitis was 12.9%. Catheters in leukopenic patients showed a longer duration of cannulation compared with catheters in nonleukopenic patients, but no difference regarding the phlebitis rate. CONCLUSION: Findings in this study partly contrast with data reported in the literature. In particular, leukopenia, female gender, prolonged duration of cannulation, antibiotics, and choice of insertion site could not be shown to be risk factors.","['Cornely, Oliver A', 'Bethe, U', 'Pauls, Regina', 'Waldschmidt, D']","['Cornely OA', 'Bethe U', 'Pauls R', 'Waldschmidt D']","['Department I of Internal Medicine, Cologne University Hospital, Germany.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol,Infection control and hospital epidemiology,8804099,['9002-84-0 (Polytetrafluoroethylene)'],IM,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/complications', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Autoimmune Diseases/complications', 'Catheterization, Peripheral/*instrumentation', 'Catheters, Indwelling/*adverse effects', 'Chi-Square Distribution', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infections/complications', 'Leukopenia/blood/*complications/diagnosis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/complications', 'Phlebitis/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Polytetrafluoroethylene/*adverse effects', 'Prospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Time Factors']",2002/05/25 10:00,2002/11/26 04:00,['2002/05/25 10:00'],"['2002/05/25 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/11/26 04:00 [medline]', '2002/05/25 10:00 [entrez]']","['ICHE4182 [pii]', '10.1086/502044 [doi]']",ppublish,Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol. 2002 May;23(5):249-53. doi: 10.1086/502044.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These derivatives were: natrium salt of morin-5'-sulfonic acid (NaMSA), natrium salt of quercetin-5'-sulfonic acid (NaQSA), complex of Mg2+ with quercetin-5'-sulfonic acid (QSA), complex of iron(II) with QSA. The antitumor activity of these agents was tested in vitro on two cell lines: L1210--murine lymphocytic leukaemia and P-815--murine mastocytoma. Our experiments showed that sulfonic derivatives of these two flavonoids were less potent than the original agents in their cytostatic and cytotoxic activities. However, their solubility in water was greater than that of the original agents and higher culture medium concentration of these derivatives was obtained. The results indicate that the ability of flavonoids to act tumoricidally is reciprocally correlated with their lipophilicity.","['Krol, Wojciech', 'Dworniczak, Szymon', 'Pietsz, Grazyna', 'Czuba, Zenon P', 'Kunicka, Mariola', 'Kopacz, Maria', 'Nowak, Dorota']","['Krol W', 'Dworniczak S', 'Pietsz G', 'Czuba ZP', 'Kunicka M', 'Kopacz M', 'Nowak D']","['Silesian Medical University, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Zabrze-Rokitnica. mikroimm@infomed.slam.katowice.pl']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Poland,Acta Pol Pharm,Acta poloniae pharmaceutica,2985167R,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Sulfonic Acids)', '8NFQ3F76WR (morin)', '9IKM0I5T1E (Quercetin)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (PSMA5 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antioxidants/chemical synthesis/pharmacology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', '*Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor/methods/statistics & numerical data', 'Flavonoids/chemical synthesis/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/*chemistry/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Quercetin/chemical synthesis/*pharmacology', 'Sulfonic Acids/chemical synthesis/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",2002/05/25 10:00,2002/06/25 10:01,['2002/05/25 10:00'],"['2002/05/25 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/06/25 10:01 [medline]', '2002/05/25 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Acta Pol Pharm. 2002 Jan-Feb;59(1):77-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because ATRA has effects (increase in apoptosis, suppression of bcl-2), it has also been used for the treatment of other French-American-British (FAB) subtypes of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). To find out the in vivo and in vitro effects of ATRA in AML, we analyzed 37 patients with de novo AML. Twenty-seven patients received ATRA before remission-induction (RI) treatment (ATRA group). Results were compared to a control group (10 patients) that received induction without ATRA during the same time period. Bone marrow or peripheral blood samples were collected from all patients on d 0 and 4. The immunphenotype, myeloperoxidase (MPO), reac tion and the efflux uptake of rhodamine 123 (Rh123) were analyzed on myeloblasts in these samples. In the myeloblasts from patients treated with ATRA, the uptake of Rh123 was increased significantly (p = 0.026) from d 0 to d 4, and all other parameters remained unaltered. ATRA administration increased the complete remission (CR) rate (88%, 22/25 vs 55%, 5/9) significantly (p = 0.042). Logistic regression analysis revealed that ATRA administration was the important factor in CR, among other potential factors including age, white blood count, bcl-2 expression, and the uptake and efflux of Rh123 (p = 0.05). Estimated disease-free survival and overall survival were similar between these two groups (43% vs 37.5% and 51.2% vs 37.5%, respectively). In conclusion, ATRA treatment prior to RI treatment may improve the CR rate in patients with de novo AML, which seems to be related to its beneficial effect on multidrug resistance.","['Ustun, C', 'Beksac, M', 'Dalva, K', 'Koc, H', 'Konuk, N', 'Ilhan, O', 'Ozcan, M', 'Topcuoglu, P', 'Sertkaya, D', 'Hayran, M']","['Ustun C', 'Beksac M', 'Dalva K', 'Koc H', 'Konuk N', 'Ilhan O', 'Ozcan M', 'Topcuoglu P', 'Sertkaya D', 'Hayran M']","['Department of Hematology, Ankara University, School of Medicine, Sihhiye, Turkey.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Med Oncol,"Medical oncology (Northwood, London, England)",9435512,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '1N3CZ14C5O (Rhodamine 123)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)', 'GIMEMA ALL 0394']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/metabolism', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Fluorescent Dyes/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/administration & dosage', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Remission Induction', 'Rhodamine 123/*metabolism', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tretinoin/*therapeutic use']",2002/05/25 10:00,2002/11/26 04:00,['2002/05/25 10:00'],"['2002/05/25 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/11/26 04:00 [medline]', '2002/05/25 10:00 [entrez]']","['MO:19:1:59 [pii]', '10.1385/MO:19:1:59 [doi]']",ppublish,Med Oncol. 2002;19(1):59-67. doi: 10.1385/MO:19:1:59.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

No change was observed in immunoprecipitation areas for IL-6 in epithelial, stromal and vascular compartments. On the other hand, changes (P < 0.05) for LIF, TGF-beta and VEGF were evident in the vascular compartment. It is possible that disparate responses observed in glandular, stromal and vascular compartments in implantation stage endometrium following fumagillin treatment actually caused from associated decline in progesterone concentration in peripheral circulation.

We now report that RGS12TS-S is a nuclear matrix protein and identify structural determinants that target this protein to the nuclear matrix and to discrete subnuclear sites. We also determine the relationship between RGS12TS-S-decorated nuclear dots and known subnuclear domains involved in control of gene expression and provide the first evidence that RGS12TS-S is functionally involved in the regulation of transcription and cell cycle events. A novel nuclear matrix-targeting sequence was identified that is distinct from a second novel motif needed for targeting RGS12TS-S to nuclear dots. RGS12TS-S nuclear dots were distinct from Cajal bodies, SC-35 domains, promyelocytic leukemia protein nuclear bodies, Polycomb group domains, and DNA replication sites. However, RGS12TS-S inhibited S-phase DNA synthesis in various tumor cell lines independently of Rb and p53 proteins, and its prolonged expression promoted formation of multinucleated cells. Expression of RGS12TS-S dramatically reduced bromo-UTP incorporation into sites of transcription. RGS12TS-S, when tethered to a Gal4 DNA binding domain, dramatically inhibited basal transcription from a Gal4-E1b TATA promoter in a histone deacetylase-independent manner. Structural analysis revealed a role for the unique N-terminal domain of RGS12TS-S in its transcriptional repressor and cell cycle-regulating activities and showed that the RGS domain was dispensable for these functions. These results provide novel insights into the structure and function of RGS12TS-S in the nucleus and demonstrate that RGS12TS-S possesses biological activities distinct from those of other members of the RGS protein family.","['Chatterjee, Tapan K', 'Fisher, Rory A']","['Chatterjee TK', 'Fisher RA']","['Department of Pharmacology, University of Iowa College of Medicine, Iowa City, Iowa 52242, USA.']",['eng'],"['DK-25295/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-41071/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (RGS Proteins)', '0 (RGS12 protein, human)', '0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Nucleus Structures/*metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA/biosynthesis', 'DNA Replication', 'Humans', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'RGS Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA Processing, Post-Transcriptional', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/metabolism', 'S Phase', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism']",2002/05/25 10:00,2002/06/25 10:01,['2002/05/25 10:00'],"['2002/05/25 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/06/25 10:01 [medline]', '2002/05/25 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/MCB.22.12.4334-4345.2002 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2002 Jun;22(12):4334-45. doi: 10.1128/MCB.22.12.4334-4345.2002.,,,PMC133853,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

FTK-transformed cells displayed drug resistance against the cytostatic drugs cisplatin and mitomycin C. These cells were not protected from drug-mediated DNA damage, implicating activation of the mechanisms preventing DNA damage-induced apoptosis. Various FTKs, except TEL/TRKC(L), can activate STAT5, which may be required to induce drug resistance. We show that STAT5 is essential for FTK-dependent upregulation of RAD51, which plays a central role in homology-dependent recombinational repair (HRR) of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). Elevated levels of Rad51 contributed to the induction of drug resistance and facilitation of the HRR in FTK-transformed cells. In addition, expression of antiapoptotic protein Bcl-xL was enhanced in cells transformed by the FTKs able to activate STAT5. Moreover, cells transformed by all examined FTKs displayed G(2)/M delay upon drug treatment. Individually, elevated levels of Rad51, Bcl-xL, or G(2)/M delay were responsible for induction of a modest drug resistance. Interestingly, combination of these three factors in nontransformed cells induced drug resistance of a magnitude similar to that observed in cells expressing FTKs activating STAT5. Thus, we postulate that RAD51-dependent facilitation of DSB repair, antiapoptotic activity of Bcl-xL, and delay in progression through the G(2)/M phase work in concert to induce drug resistance in FTK-positive leukemias and lymphomas.","['Slupianek, Artur', 'Hoser, Grazyna', 'Majsterek, Ireneusz', 'Bronisz, Agnieszka', 'Malecki, Maciej', 'Blasiak, Janusz', 'Fishel, Richard', 'Skorski, Tomasz']","['Slupianek A', 'Hoser G', 'Majsterek I', 'Bronisz A', 'Malecki M', 'Blasiak J', 'Fishel R', 'Skorski T']","['Center for Biotechnology, College of Science and Technology, Temple University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19122, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA089052/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA89052/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Bcl2l1 protein, mouse)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (TEL-ABL fusion protein, human)', '0 (TEL-JAK2 fusion protein, human)', '0 (TEL-JAK2 fusion protein, mouse)', '0 (TEL-PDGFRbeta fusion protein, human)', '0 (TEL-TRKC fusion protein, human)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (p80(NPM-ALK) protein)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (RAD51 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Rad51 Recombinase)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Rad51 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'DNA Repair/*drug effects', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/drug effects/genetics/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance/*physiology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl', 'G2 Phase/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mitosis/drug effects', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/drug effects/genetics/metabolism', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*drug effects/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/drug effects/metabolism', 'Rad51 Recombinase', '*Recombination, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'bcl-X Protein']",2002/05/25 10:00,2002/06/25 10:01,['2002/05/25 10:00'],"['2002/05/25 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/06/25 10:01 [medline]', '2002/05/25 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/MCB.22.12.4189-4201.2002 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2002 Jun;22(12):4189-201. doi: 10.1128/MCB.22.12.4189-4201.2002.,,,PMC133854,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The presence of RGS box and Dbl homology domains within LARG suggests this protein may also function as a GAP toward specific G alpha subunits and couple G alpha activation to RhoA-mediating signaling pathways. Unlike the RGS box of p115 RhoGEF, the RGS box of LARG interacts not only with G alpha 12 and G alpha 13 but also with G alpha q. In cellular coimmunoprecipitation studies, the LARG RGS box formed stable complexes with the transition state mimetic forms of G alpha q, G alpha 12, and G alpha 13. Expression of the LARG RGS box diminished the transforming activity of oncogenic G protein-coupled receptors (Mas, G2A, and m1-muscarinic cholinergic) coupled to G alpha q and G alpha 13. Activated G alpha q, as well as G alpha 12 and G alpha 13, cooperated with LARG and caused synergistic activation of RhoA, suggesting that all three G alpha subunits stimulate LARG-mediated activation of RhoA. Our findings suggest that the RhoA exchange factor LARG, unlike the related p115 RhoGEF and PDZ-RhoGEF proteins, can serve as an effector for Gq-coupled receptors, mediating their functional linkage to RhoA-dependent signaling pathways.","['Booden, Michelle A', 'Siderovski, David P', 'Der, Channing J']","['Booden MA', 'Siderovski DP', 'Der CJ']","['Department of Pharmacology, Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, 27599, USA. mbooden@med.unc.edu']",['eng'],"['R01 GM062338/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'GM62338/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'CA63071/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA092240/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA92240/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA063071/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Arhgef12 protein, mouse)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (G2A receptor)', '0 (Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled)', '0 (Rho Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors)', 'EC 3.6.5.1 (GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, G12-G13)', 'EC 3.6.5.1 (GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, Gq-G11)', 'EC 3.6.5.1 (Heterotrimeric GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rhoA GTP-Binding Protein)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Amino Acid Motifs', 'Animals', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, G12-G13', 'GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, Gq-G11', 'Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Heterotrimeric GTP-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/metabolism', '*Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled', 'Rho Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors', 'Signal Transduction', 'rhoA GTP-Binding Protein/genetics/*metabolism']",2002/05/25 10:00,2002/06/25 10:01,['2002/05/25 10:00'],"['2002/05/25 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/06/25 10:01 [medline]', '2002/05/25 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/MCB.22.12.4053-4061.2002 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2002 Jun;22(12):4053-61. doi: 10.1128/MCB.22.12.4053-4061.2002.,,,PMC133844,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RT-PCR indicated that both patients were negative for BCR-ABL, but FISH analysis suggested that the BCR gene was rearranged. Since other translocations in MPDs frequently involve tyrosine kinases, we designed a multiplex PCR to search for mRNA fusions between BCR and three potential partner genes at 4q12: KIT, KDR and PDGFRA. An unusual inframe BCR-PDGFRA fusion mRNA was identified in both patients, with either BCR exon 7 or exon 12 fused to short BCR intron-derived sequences, which were in turn fused to part of PDGFRA exon 12. Sequencing of the genomic breakpoint junctions showed that the chromosome 22 breakpoints fell in BCR introns whereas the chromosome 4 breakpoints were within PDGFRA exon 12.

Phytochemicals such as flavones can inhibit CYP1A2 activity competitively, and hydroxylated derivatives of flavone (galangin) may be potent, selective inhibitors of CYP1A2 activity relative to CYP1A1 activity. Molecular modelling of the CYP1A2 interaction with hydroxylated derivatives of flavone suggests that a number of hydrophobic residues of the substrate-binding domain engage in hydrogen bonding with such inhibitors. 2. We have tested this model using site-directed mutagenesis of these residues in expression plasmids transfected into the human B-lymphoblastoid cell line, AHH-1 TK+/-. 3. Consistent with the molecular model's predicted placement in the active site, amino acid substitutions at the predicted residues abolished CYP1A2 enzymatic activity. 4. Transfected cell lines contained equal amounts of immunoreactive CYP1A2. 5.

The abundant presence of tPA protein in cellular vesicles implies that its acute release, e.g. upon ischaemic stroke or trauma, could play a role in neuronal damage. We also found in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), and to a lesser extent patients with leukaemia and encephalitis, prominently elevated tPA activity in the cerebrospinal fluid and in MS in neurons in the proximity of areas of demyelination elevated tPA mRNA and antigen levels.

The participation of certain cytokines in this process is generally accepted (transforming growth factor-beta induces fibrosis), while the roles of other cytokines are less clear. Oncostatin M (OSM) is a member of the interleukin-6/leukaemia inhibitory factor (or gp130) cytokine family, and its participation in inflammation and the regulation of ECM metabolism is supported by a number of activities identified in vitro, including regulation of matrix metalloproteinase-1 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1. Local overexpression of transforming growth factor-beta has been shown to be fibrogenic in mouse lung, whereas local OSM overexpression via intra-articular administration has been shown to induce a pannus-like inflammatory response in the synovium of mouse knee joints. Here we examine the effects of OSM in the context of those of transforming growth factor-beta using an established adenovirus vector that expresses mOSM (AdmOSM). We administered the virus intra-nasally into Balb/C mice to achieve high expression of OSM in the lung, and examined the effects at various time points. AdmOSM resulted in a vigorous inflammatory response by day 7 which was characterized by an elevation of neutrophil and mononuclear cell numbers and a marked increase in collagen deposition. These data support the use of such systems to study the ECM in vivo, and indicate a potential role for OSM in inflammatory responses that can modulate steady-state ECM deposition in Balb/C mice.","['Richards, C D', 'Kerr, C', 'Tong, L', 'Langdon, C']","['Richards CD', 'Kerr C', 'Tong L', 'Langdon C']","['Centre for Gene Therapeutics, Department of Pathology and Molecular Medicine, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada L8N 3Z5. richards@mcmaster.ca']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem Soc Trans,Biochemical Society transactions,7506897,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Osm protein, mouse)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase-1)', '106956-32-5 (Oncostatin M)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Adenoviridae/genetics', 'Animals', 'Cytokines/pharmacology', 'Extracellular Matrix/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Lung/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Oncostatin M', 'Peptides/*genetics/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase-1/genetics']",2002/05/25 10:00,2002/11/26 04:00,['2002/05/25 10:00'],"['2002/05/25 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/11/26 04:00 [medline]', '2002/05/25 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1042/ [doi]'],ppublish,Biochem Soc Trans. 2002 Apr;30(2):107-11. doi: 10.1042/.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previously, we demonstrated that IL-15Ralpha expression was activated by HTLV-I Tax, in part, through the action of NF-kappaB. However, there appeared to be additional motifs within the IL-15Ralpha promoter that were responsive to HTLV-I Tax. In this study, we demonstrated that IL-15Ralpha mRNA expression was activated in human monocytes by IFN treatment, suggesting a role for IFN regulatory factors (IRFs) in IL-15Ralpha transcription. In addition, an IRF element within the Tax-responsive element of the IL-15Ralpha promoter was necessary for maximal Tax-induced activation of this promoter. Furthermore, we demonstrated that IRF-4, a transcription factor known to be elevated in HTLV-I-infected cells, activated the IL-15Ralpha promoter. Inhibition of IRF-4 action lead to reduced Tax-induced activation of the IL-15Ralpha promoter, while inhibition of both IRF-4 and NF-kappaB severely inhibited the Tax-induced activation of this promoter. These findings suggest a role for both NF-kappaB and IRF-4 in the transcriptional regulation of IL-15Ralpha by HTLV-I Tax. It is possible that the HTLV-I Tax-mediated induction of IL-15Ralpha and IL-15 may lead to an autocrine cytokine-mediated stimulatory loop leading to the proliferation of HTLV-I infected cells. This loop of proliferation may facilitate viral propagation and play a role in HTLV-I-mediated disease progression.","['Mariner, Jennifer M', 'Mamane, Yael', 'Hiscott, John', 'Waldmann, Thomas A', 'Azimi, Nazli']","['Mariner JM', 'Mamane Y', 'Hiscott J', 'Waldmann TA', 'Azimi N']","['Metabolism Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (IL15RA protein, human)', '0 (Interferon Regulatory Factors)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-15)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (interferon regulatory factor-4)', '9008-11-1 (Interferons)']",IM,"['DNA-Binding Proteins/*physiology', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Products, tax/pharmacology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Interferon Regulatory Factors', 'Interferons/pharmacology', 'Lipopolysaccharides/pharmacology', 'Models, Biological', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Receptors, Interleukin-15', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/*genetics', 'Response Elements', 'Transcription Factors/*physiology']",2002/05/23 10:00,2002/06/13 10:01,['2002/05/23 10:00'],"['2002/05/23 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/06/13 10:01 [medline]', '2002/05/23 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.4049/jimmunol.168.11.5667 [doi]'],ppublish,J Immunol. 2002 Jun 1;168(11):5667-74. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.168.11.5667.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As2O3 in combination with ionizing radiation have a synergistic effect in decreasing clonogenic survival and in the regression of established human cervical tumor xenografts. Pretreatment of the cells with As2O3 also synergistically enhanced radiation-induced apoptosis. Apoptosis of the cells by combined treatment of As2O3 and radiation was associated with reactive oxygen species generation and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, resulting in the activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3. The combined treatment also resulted in an increased G2/M cell cycle distribution at the concentration of As2O3 which did not alter cell cycle when applied alone.

CASE SUMMARY: A 53-year-old white man was treated with chemotherapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Four weeks after initiation of treatment, he recovered his blood cell counts, but developed fever and was prescribed oral ciprofloxacin 500 mg twice daily. After 4 doses, he developed the typical features of HUS manifested by microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, oliguric renal failure, and thrombocytopenia. The medication was withdrawn, and he received 5 sessions of plasma exchange. He recovered completely and has normal renal function. DISCUSSION: Secondary HUS or its related syndrome, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), is uncommon, but has been reported in association with cancer, chemotherapy, and a variety of medications. Our case represents a possible adverse drug reaction to ciprofloxacin according to the Naranjo probability scale. It is the first reported case of HUS associated with ciprofloxacin. CONCLUSIONS: Ciprofloxacin use was followed by HUS in our patient and was possibly causally related. Early detection, discontinuation of the offending medication, and treatment of HUS/TTP is critical.","['Allan, David S', 'Thompson, Cheryl M', 'Barr, Robert M', 'Clark, William F', 'Chin-Yee, Ian H']","['Allan DS', 'Thompson CM', 'Barr RM', 'Clark WF', 'Chin-Yee IH']","['University of Western Ontario, London, Canada.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Ann Pharmacother,The Annals of pharmacotherapy,9203131,"['0 (Anti-Infective Agents)', '5E8K9I0O4U (Ciprofloxacin)']",IM,"['Anti-Infective Agents/*adverse effects', 'Ciprofloxacin/*adverse effects', 'Hemolytic-Uremic Syndrome/*chemically induced/complications/etiology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications']",2002/05/23 10:00,2003/02/13 04:00,['2002/05/23 10:00'],"['2002/05/23 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/02/13 04:00 [medline]', '2002/05/23 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1345/aph.1A350 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Pharmacother. 2002 Jun;36(6):1000-2. doi: 10.1345/aph.1A350.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Sixty-one patients, ranging in age from 2 to 18 years (mean, 8.8+/-4.8 years old), with diagnoses of pancreatitis were studied from July 1986 through June 2000. RESULTS: Twenty-eight pancreatitis cases resulted from physical trauma, 13 cases of which were from traffic accident (53.8% from motorcycle accident). Other pathogenic factors included systemic diseases (N=9), pancreaticobiliary-tree anomalies (N=7), toxin ingestion or drug use (N=4), Ascaris infection (N=1), and idiopathic (N=12). Symptoms included abdominal pain (N=58), vomiting (N=23), fever (N=18), and jaundice (N=2). Hyperamylasemia was found in 51 children (83.6%). Twenty-seven patients (90.0%) had elevated serum lipase levels (>190 U/L) of 30 evaluated. The amylase to creatinine clearance ratio was assayed for 35 cases, of which 28 (80.0%) were elevated (>6%). Ultrasonography revealed inflammatory changes of the pancreas in 40 of 51 patients evaluated, while computed tomogram demonstrated evidence of pancreatic inflammation for all 21 patients evaluated. Fifteen cases required surgery, while the other 46 were managed conservatively. One patient died because of acute necrotizing pancreatitis 3 days after L-asparaginase treatment for leukemia. The other patients survived well during long-term follow up. CONCLUSION: Pancreatitis in children is more common than generally believed. Physical trauma, especially because of motorcycle accidents, was the leading cause of pediatric pancreatitis in southern Taiwan. The mortality rate was low. Only one patient who had undergone chemotherapy with L-asparaginase died of the disease.","['Tiao, Mao-Meng', 'Chuang, Jiin-Haur', 'Ko, Sheung-Fat', 'Kuo, Hsin-Wei', 'Liang, Chi-Di', 'Chen, Chao-Long']","['Tiao MM', 'Chuang JH', 'Ko SF', 'Kuo HW', 'Liang CD', 'Chen CL']","[""Department of Pediatrics, Chang Gung Children's Hospital, Kaohsiung, Taiwan, ROC.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],China (Republic : 1949- ),Chang Gung Med J,Chang Gung medical journal,101088034,['EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Asparaginase/adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Pancreatitis/diagnosis/etiology/*therapy', 'Retrospective Studies']",2002/05/23 10:00,2002/06/13 10:01,['2002/05/23 10:00'],"['2002/05/23 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/06/13 10:01 [medline]', '2002/05/23 10:00 [entrez]']",['2503/250303 [pii]'],ppublish,Chang Gung Med J. 2002 Mar;25(3):162-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two months after arrival and over a period of four weeks, six of 400 mice purchased from an approved vendor, developed progressive hind limb paralysis without other clinical signs of disease. On the basis of the histopathologic changes and negative serologic test results, lymphoblastic lymphoma causing compression of the spinal cord was diagnosed. There were two leading features to this outbreak: its unusual epidemiologic presentation, and the localization of the lesions principally in the lumbar muscles. A presumptive diagnosis of retroviral infection with Abelson's murine leukemia virus (A-MuLV) was established on the basis of histopathologic and immunohistochemical findings. Little is known about retroviral status in many commercial colonies, and few users report presence of spontaneous lymphomas. This report points out complications derived from commercially available animals that carry endogenous retroviruses.

DESIGN: Laboratory study. SETTING: Teaching hospital, Japan. MATERIAL: Human lymphocytes isolated from healthy histoincompatible donors in mixed lymphocyte cultures or stimulated with phytohemagglutinin (PHA) to promote IL-2Ralpha expression. MJ, an HTLV-1-infected malignant T-cell line that overexpresses IL-2Ralpha, and the IL-2Ralpha-negative cell lines MOLT-4F and MT-1, were used as controls. INTERVENTIONS: Bovine RNaseA was chemically conjugated to 7G7B6, a monoclonal antibody to the alpha-chain of human IL-2 receptors, and several concentrations of the conjugates were added to the lymphocyte cultures. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Inhibition of cell proliferation as a percentage of 3H-thymidine incorporation in 24 hours. RESULTS: 7G7B6-RNaseA dose-dependently inhibited cell proliferation in PHA-stimulated human lymphocytes at a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 2 x 10(-7) M. whereas RNase alone and RNase plus antibody had no inhibitory effect. 7G7B6-RNaseA also dose-dependently inhibited the human mixed lymphocyte reaction at an IC50 of 2 x 10(-6) M, whereas RNase alone did not. The conjugate also inhibited cell proliferation in MJ cells, a cell line that is infected with HTLV-I and overexpresses the high-affinity IL-2 receptor, at an IC50 of 5 x 10(-7) M. However the conjugate had no inhibitory effect on the IL-2 receptor non-expressing human T-cell lymphoblastic leukaemia cell lines MOLT-4F or MT-1. CONCLUSION: 7G7B6-RNaseA can inhibit cell proliferation in antigen- or mitogen-stimulated lymphocytes that overexpress high-affinity IL-2 receptors, and it may be safer than conventional chemotherapy or immunotoxins in the treatment of transplant rejection, certain lymphocytic malignancies, and other IL-2R-associated diseases, because it contains a mammalian cytotoxic enzyme.","['Yamamura, Tadashi', 'Ueda, Masakazu', 'Psarras, Kyriakos', 'Suwa, Tatsushi', 'Watanaabe, Yasuo', 'Kameyama, Noriaki', 'Tanabe, Minoru', 'Imamura, Hiroji', 'Kitajima, Masaki']","['Yamamura T', 'Ueda M', 'Psarras K', 'Suwa T', 'Watanaabe Y', 'Kameyama N', 'Tanabe M', 'Imamura H', 'Kitajima M']","['Department of Surgery, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Surg,The European journal of surgery = Acta chirurgica,9105264,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', 'EC 3.1.27.5 (Ribonuclease, Pancreatic)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cattle', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*pharmacology', 'Lymphocyte Culture Test, Mixed', 'Lymphocytes/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/*drug effects', 'Ribonuclease, Pancreatic/*pharmacology']",2002/05/23 10:00,2002/11/26 04:00,['2002/05/23 10:00'],"['2002/05/23 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/11/26 04:00 [medline]', '2002/05/23 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/110241502317307571 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Surg. 2002;168(1):49-54. doi: 10.1080/110241502317307571.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction revealed an in-frame fusion between the Ewing sarcoma gene ( EWS) codon 325 and the activating transcription factor 1 gene ( ATF1) codon 65 which permits the production of chimeric EWS-ATF1 oncoproteins. We also identified the genomic breakpoint resulting from a reciprocal t(12;22)(q13;q12), which is the hallmark of malignant melanoma of soft parts (MMSP). We applied Affymetrix human cancer G110 arrays to compare the gene expression patterns of GG-62 and other cell lines derived from small blue round cell tumors of childhood. Hierarchical clustering of 463 differentially expressed genes distinguished GG-62 from the ETs, as well as the neuroblastomas, and revealed a cluster of 36 upregulated genes. Several of these genes are involved in signal transduction pathways that may be critical for maintaining cell transformation; some examples are avian erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 3 ( ERBB3), neuregulin 1 ( NRG1), fibroblast growth factor 9 ( FGF9), and fibroblast growth factor receptor-1 ( FGFR1). Furthermore, genes near the chromosome-12q13 breakpoint exhibited increased expression of GG-62 including ERBB3, NR4A1 (nuclear receptor subfamily 4, group A, member 1), cyclin-dependent kinase 2 ( CDK2), and alpha 5 integrin ( ITGA5). Altogether our findings demonstrate the MMSP derivation of GG-62 and may shed light on the mechanisms of tumorigenesis in this rare disease.","['Schaefer, Karl-Ludwig', 'Wai, Daniel H', 'Poremba, Christopher', 'Korsching, Eberhard', 'van Valen, Frans', 'Ozaki, Toshifumi', 'Boecker, Werner', 'Dockhorn-Dworniczak, Barbara']","['Schaefer KL', 'Wai DH', 'Poremba C', 'Korsching E', 'van Valen F', 'Ozaki T', 'Boecker W', 'Dockhorn-Dworniczak B']","['Gerhard-Domagk-Institute of Pathology, University of Munster, Domagkstrasse 17, 48149 Munster, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Virchows Arch,Virchows Archiv : an international journal of pathology,9423843,"['0 (Activating Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (FGF9 protein, human)', '0 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 9)', '0 (Neuregulin-1)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Receptors, Fibroblast Growth Factor)', '0 (S100 Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Vimentin)', '62031-54-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FGFR1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, ErbB-3)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 1)']",IM,"['Activating Transcription Factor 1', 'Adult', 'Bone Neoplasms/chemistry/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 12', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 22', '*DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Female', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 9', 'Fibroblast Growth Factors/genetics', 'Fibula', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Melanoma/chemistry/*genetics', 'Musculoskeletal System', 'Neuregulin-1/genetics', 'Neuroblastoma/genetics', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/genetics', 'Receptor, ErbB-3/genetics', 'Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 1', 'Receptors, Fibroblast Growth Factor/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'S100 Proteins/analysis', 'Sarcoma, Ewing/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vimentin/analysis']",2002/05/22 10:00,2002/07/27 10:01,['2002/05/22 10:00'],"['2001/08/06 00:00 [received]', '2001/09/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/05/22 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/07/27 10:01 [medline]', '2002/05/22 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00428-001-0558-9 [doi]'],ppublish,Virchows Arch. 2002 May;440(5):476-84. doi: 10.1007/s00428-001-0558-9.

The current hypothesis is that the cytotoxic effects of thiopurines are caused by the incorporation of thioguanine nucleotides into DNA. In this context, S-methylation catalyzed by TPMT can be regarded as a competing metabolic pathway. The authors assayed the TPMT activity in red blood cells from 122 patients treated with azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine (83 adults with inflammatory bowel disease and 39 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia) and in 290 untreated controls (219 adult blood donors and 71 children). The concentrations of thioguanine nucleotides and methylthioinosine monophosphate were also assayed in red blood cells from the patients. The TPMT activity and the concentrations of methylthioinosine monophosphate and thioguanine nucleotides were higher in children than in adults. All children but no adult patient received concomitant methotrexate. Interaction between methotrexate and 6-mercaptopurine has been described, and may explain the results. Low TPMT activity in adult patients with inflammatory bowel disease correlated to an increased incidence of adverse drug reactions. However, there was no correlation between TPMT activity and the red blood cell concentrations of methylthioinosine monophosphate or thioguanine nucleotides, or between the concentrations of these metabolites and the occurrence of adverse effects. The results show that the role of thiopurine metabolism for drug effects is complex.","['Pettersson, Birgitta', 'Almer, Sven', 'Albertioni, Freidoun', 'Soderhall, Stefan', 'Peterson, Curt']","['Pettersson B', 'Almer S', 'Albertioni F', 'Soderhall S', 'Peterson C']","['Department of Clinical Pharmacology, University Hospital, SE-58185 Linkoping, Sweden.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Controlled Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Ther Drug Monit,Therapeutic drug monitoring,7909660,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Thionucleotides)', '46S541971T (Thioinosine)', ""7021-52-5 (6-methylthiopurine ribonucleoside-5'-phosphate)"", 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.67 (thiopurine methyltransferase)', 'MRK240IY2L (Azathioprine)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/blood/therapeutic use', 'Azathioprine/blood/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Erythrocytes/*enzymology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/blood/therapeutic use', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/blood/*therapeutic use', 'Methotrexate/blood/therapeutic use', 'Methyltransferases/blood/*genetics', 'Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Thioinosine/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Thionucleotides/metabolism']",2002/05/22 10:00,2002/11/26 04:00,['2002/05/22 10:00'],"['2002/05/22 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/11/26 04:00 [medline]', '2002/05/22 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00007691-200206000-00005 [doi]'],ppublish,Ther Drug Monit. 2002 Jun;24(3):351-8. doi: 10.1097/00007691-200206000-00005.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Progenitor cells transformed by this virus can be expanded in vitro as undifferentiated clones for up to two months and can also be induced to differentiate into cells of the erythroid, eosinophilic, thrombocytic, and myelomonocytic lineages with reproducible kinetics. Aside from the proliferative stimulus provided by the E26 oncoprotein, these cells are remarkably similar to normal hematopoietic progenitors. They therefore provide an ideal assay system for determining the influence of ectopically expressed transcription factors on both maturation and commitment to several hematopoietic lineages. Results from experiments using this system suggest that subtle shifts in the balance of lineage-restricted transcription factors can result in profound changes in phenotype and challenge the notion that lineage commitment is a uni-directional process. Analysis of the regulatory elements governing the expression of these genes has provided novel mechanistic insights into the transcriptional control of hematopoiesis. In addition to their utility in deciphering the control of lineage commitment, the ability to grow large numbers of undifferentiated and more mature hematopoietic cells has facilitated the discovery of a number of novel, lineage-restricted genes. Analysis of the proteins encoded by these genes is helping to clarify the role of a number of membrane proteins in the interaction between hematopoietic cells and their microenvironments.","['Nielsen, Julie S', 'Doyonnas, Regis', 'McNagny, Kelly M']","['Nielsen JS', 'Doyonnas R', 'McNagny KM']","['The Biomedical Research Centre, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Switzerland,Cells Tissues Organs,"Cells, tissues, organs",100883360,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Avian Proteins)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (EOS47 protein, Gallus gallus)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/genetics/metabolism', 'Avian Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biomarkers', 'Bird Diseases/virology', 'Birds', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', '*Cell Lineage', 'Hematopoiesis/*physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/metabolism', 'Models, Biological', 'Phenotype', 'Retroviridae/*genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic']",2002/05/22 10:00,2003/01/18 04:00,['2002/05/22 10:00'],"['2002/05/22 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/18 04:00 [medline]', '2002/05/22 10:00 [entrez]']","['57691 [pii]', '10.1159/000057691 [doi]']",ppublish,Cells Tissues Organs. 2002;171(1):44-63. doi: 10.1159/000057691.,,,,,,,79,,"['Copyright 2002 S.

The initial treatment consisted of multidrug chemotherapy (B-DOPA and MVPP) combined with local radiotherapy. Relapses occurred in 35 cases (7,9%). Two patients from other centres were also included in this analysis. Four patients were lost to follow-up; 33 patients with relapses were analysed. Early relapses (first complete remission (CR) shorter than 12 months) occurred in 17 cases. Treatment of the first relapse consisted of different types of multidrug chemotherapy. Six patients underwent high-dose chemotherapy and peripheral blood stem cells transplantation. Radiotherapy was used in 19 children. Second CR was achieved in 28 patients (85%). In 10 children (36%) second relapse occurred after 4 to 21 months (median = 10). In 17 cases the second CR lasted 12-14 (median=54) months. The probability of the 7-year freedom from second relapse was 64%. Eleven patients died; one of them in second CR due to toxic liver damage. Results of treatment in children with early relapses were significantly worse. In 17 patients with early relapse, and 16 children with late relapse, the second CR was achieved in 70% and 100% of cases, respectively. The probability of the 7-year overall survival, freedom from second relapse and event-free survival in children with early and late relapse was: 42, 58, 40%, and 94, 69, and 66%, respectively. The therapeutic results in the subgroups of children with relapses treated with different methods were not comparable because of the small number of children in each group. The use of multidrug chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy allows to achieve a long lasting second CR in more than 50% of children with HD who relapsed after initial combined modality treatment. The optimal treatment of relapsed HD in patients initially treated with multidrug chemotherapy with or without of radiotherapy, is currently unknown.","['Balwierz, W', 'Moryl-Bujakowska, A', 'Boguslawska-Jaworska, J', 'Pisarek, J', 'Ras, M', 'Sonta-Jakimczyk, D', 'Janik-Moszant, A', 'Rokicka-Milewska, R', 'Sopylo, B', 'Kolakowska-Mrozowska, B', 'Kolecki, P', 'Kaczmarek-Kanold, M', 'Kowalczyk, J', 'Odoj, T', 'Matysiak, M', 'Newecka-Samol, T']","['Balwierz W', 'Moryl-Bujakowska A', 'Boguslawska-Jaworska J', 'Pisarek J', 'Ras M', 'Sonta-Jakimczyk D', 'Janik-Moszant A', 'Rokicka-Milewska R', 'Sopylo B', 'Kolakowska-Mrozowska B', 'Kolecki P', 'Kaczmarek-Kanold M', 'Kowalczyk J', 'Odoj T', 'Matysiak M', 'Newecka-Samol T']","['Klinika Onkologii, i Hematologii Dzieciecej, PA Instytut Pediatrii, Wydzial Lekarski UJ, 30-663 Krakow, ul.

A total number of 102 children: 58 boys and 44 girls aged 1-17 years (median 9.4 years old) with CML, treated in the period 1975-1999 were included in the study. Forty eight of 102 (47.1 %) children were treated with cytostatic drugs without IFN alpha: busulfan, hydroxyurea, 6-mercaptopurine or etoposide (VP-16). Fifty four of 102 (52.9%) patients were treated with interferon alpha (IFN alpha) after cytoreductive pretreatment. Thirty out of 102 (29.4%) patients underwent stem cell transplantation (SCT): 24 - matched related donor allo-BMT, 2 - matched unrelated donor allo-BMT, 1 - partially matched related donor T-cell depleted allo-PBPCT, 1 - syngeneic allo-BMT and 2 - autologous PBPCT. Overall survival analysis revealed that 46 of the 102 (45.1%) children remained alive: 5/35 (14.3%) children treated with cytostatics alone, 22/37 (59.5%) children treated with IFN alpha and 19/30 (63.3%) children treated with SCT. Among SCT survivors there are 10/17 (58.8%) children treated with IFN alpha prior to SCT and 9/13 (69.2%) children treated with cytostatics alone prior to SCT. The probability of 5-year survival is 0.51 in the group treated with SCT (median follow-up 58 months); 0.43 in the group treated with IFN alpha (median follow-up 53 months) and 0.23 in the group treated with cytostatics (median follow-up 31 months). Our data show, that BMT is the treatment of choice in CML in children. IFN alpha could be successfully applied as an alternative treatment for those, who do not have a suitable donor for allogeneic SCT. Better outcome in post BMT children, who were not treated with IFN alpha prior to SCT requires confirmation by studies on larger groups of patients. However, it seems to be justified to stop IFN alpha therapy at least 3 months before SCT.

It therefore becomes essential to develop novel chemotherapeutic agents with lower levels of toxicity. The beta-lactam antibiotics have been used for many years to treat bacterial infections with limited or no toxicity. Until now, it has never been shown that beta-lactams could kill tumor cells. Here, for the first time, we have discovered and characterized the apoptosis-inducing properties of a family of novel beta-lactam antibiotics against human leukemia, breast, prostate, and head-and-neck cancer cells. We found that one particular lead compound (lactam 1) with an N-methylthio group was able to induce DNA damage and inhibit DNA replication in Jurkat T cells within a 2-h treatment. This was followed by p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase activation, S phase arrest, and apoptotic cell death. p38 was found to be a central player in beta-lactam-induced apoptosis and resided downstream of DNA damage but upstream of caspase activation. Accompanying caspase-8 activation was cleavage of the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family protein Bid, and release of the mitochondrial cytochrome c. This was also associated with activation of caspase-9 and -3. Analogs of lactam 1 in which the N-methylthio group was replaced with other organothio chains exhibited progressive decreased potencies to induce DNA damage, p38 kinase activation, S phase arrest, and apoptosis, demonstrating requirement of the N-methylthio group. Because of the ease of synthesis and structural manipulation, we believe these beta-lactams may have the potential to be developed into anticancer agents.","['Smith, David M', 'Kazi, Aslamuzzaman', 'Smith, Lisa', 'Long, Timothy E', 'Heldreth, Bart', 'Turos, Edward', 'Dou, Q Ping']","['Smith DM', 'Kazi A', 'Smith L', 'Long TE', 'Heldreth B', 'Turos E', 'Dou QP']","['Drug Discovery Program, and the Department of Chemistry, College of Arts and Sciences, University of South Florida, Tampa, Florida 33612-9497, USA.']",['eng'],['AI13300/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Cytochrome c Group)', '0 (beta-Lactams)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Anti-Bacterial Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cytochrome c Group/metabolism', '*DNA Damage', 'DNA Replication/*drug effects', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'S Phase/drug effects', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'beta-Lactams', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases']",2002/05/22 10:00,2002/06/18 10:01,['2002/05/22 10:00'],"['2002/05/22 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/06/18 10:01 [medline]', '2002/05/22 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1124/mol.61.6.1348 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 2002 Jun;61(6):1348-58. doi: 10.1124/mol.61.6.1348.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Attempts have now been made to characterize the cell death pathway(s) involved in this phenomenon. In contrast to cytochrome c release and caspase-3 activation, which occur within 2.5 h of PMA/FP coexposure, caspase-8 activation and Bid cleavage appeared as later events. Such findings implicate the mitochondria-dependent pathway in the initial induction of apoptosis by PMA/FP. However, U937 cells ectopically expressing CrmA, dominant-negative caspase-8, or dominant-negative Fas-associated death domain that were highly resistant to tumor necrosis factor (TNF)/cycloheximide-induced lethality displayed significant, albeit incomplete, resistance to PMA/FP-induced apoptosis after 24 h. Furthermore, coadministration of TNF soluble receptor significantly attenuated PMA/FP-induced apoptosis in U937 (p < 0.02) and HL-60 (p < 0.03) cells at 24 h. PMA/FP coadministration also triggered substantial increases in TNFalpha mRNA and protein secretion compared with the effects of PMA administered alone. The protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide (1 microM) completely blocked PMA/FP-induced TNFalpha secretion in U937 cells and attenuated apoptosis. Taken together, these results suggest that coadministration of PMA with FP in myeloid leukemia cells initially triggers mitochondrial damage, an event followed by the PKC-dependent induction and release of TNFalpha, supporting a model in which the synergistic induction of leukemic cell apoptosis by this drug combination proceeds via both mitochondrial- and TNF receptor-related apoptotic pathways.","['Cartee, L', 'Smith, R', 'Dai, Y', 'Rahmani, M', 'Rosato, R', 'Almenara, J', 'Dent, P', 'Grant, S']","['Cartee L', 'Smith R', 'Dai Y', 'Rahmani M', 'Rosato R', 'Almenara J', 'Dent P', 'Grant S']","['Department of Medicine, Virginia Commonwealth University, Medical College of Virginia, Richmond, Virginia 23298-0230, USA.']",['eng'],"['CA63573/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA77141/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA83705/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA88906/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'F32 CA90194-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arabidopsis Proteins)', '0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (Enzyme Precursors)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '45AD6X575G (alvocidib)', 'EC 1.14.19.- (Fatty Acid Desaturases)', 'EC 1.14.99.- (Fad7 protein, Arabidopsis)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP8 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', '*Arabidopsis Proteins', 'Carcinogens/pharmacology', 'Caspase 8', 'Caspase 9', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Precursors/metabolism', 'Fatty Acid Desaturases/metabolism', 'Flavonoids/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/physiology', 'Piperidines/*pharmacology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*physiology', 'U937 Cells']",2002/05/22 10:00,2002/06/18 10:01,['2002/05/22 10:00'],"['2002/05/22 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/06/18 10:01 [medline]', '2002/05/22 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1124/mol.61.6.1313 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 2002 Jun;61(6):1313-21. doi: 10.1124/mol.61.6.1313.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It significantly prolonged the survival days of EL-4-transplanted mice. In vitro study revealed that its antiproliferative effect appeared only after 2 days of treatment. At that time, protein synthesis was significantly inhibited rather than DNA and RNA syntheses. Furthermore, DSG induced apoptosis without arresting the cell cycle. p70 S6 kinase (p70S6K), a key molecule in protein synthesis, was inhibited by 2 days of treatment of DSG. Akt, an upstream kinase of p70S6K, was also deactivated by 2 days of treatment of DSG. Hsp90 is reported to bind to and stabilize Akt kinase and also to bind to DSG. Yet DSG did not inhibit the binding of Hsp90 to Akt kinase. PI3-kinase, an activator of Akt, was not affected by DSG treatment. However, when we looked into phospholipid synthesis, we found that DSG inhibited phosphatidylcholine (PC) synthesis strongly rather than phosphatidylinositol even by 1 day of treatment. Moreover, DSG failed to inhibit Akt kinase activation and PC synthesis in DSG-less sensitive human K562 leukemia cells. These results demonstrate that DSG inhibits tumor cell growth through the inhibition of protein synthesis and induction of apoptosis, which is caused by the down-regulation of Akt kinase and p70S6K. It is also indicated that the down-regulation of Akt kinase by DSG should not depend on PI3-kinase and Hsp90. There might be possible involvement of PC in Akt kinase activity.","['Kawada, Manabu', 'Masuda, Tohru', 'Ishizuka, Masaaki', 'Takeuchi, Tomio']","['Kawada M', 'Masuda T', 'Ishizuka M', 'Takeuchi T']","['Institute for Chemotherapy, Microbial Chemistry Research Foundation, 18-24 Miyamoto, Numazu-shi, Shizuoka 410-0301, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Guanidines)', '0 (Phosphatidylcholines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (AKT1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinases)', 'UJ0ZJ76DO9 (gusperimus)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Female', 'Guanidines/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Kinetics', 'Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Phosphatidylcholines/antagonists & inhibitors/*biosynthesis', '*Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinases/metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/05/22 10:00,2002/09/17 10:01,['2002/05/22 10:00'],"['2002/05/22 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/17 10:01 [medline]', '2002/05/22 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M200318200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)66239-3 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2002 Aug 2;277(31):27765-71. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M200318200.

This is followed by binding of a coreceptor of the chemokine receptor family and subsequently fusion of viral and cellular membranes. Membrane fusion is independent of whether the viral envelope protein is on the viral or on the cellular membrane. Accordingly, targeting of HIV infected cells by retroviral vectors has been previously achieved both by coincorporation of CD4 and coreceptors into murine leukemia virus (MLV) and lentivirus based vector particles. It was, therefore, tested whether hybrid genes of CD4 and CXCR4 are also able to yield 'receptor' vectors. A construct containing the four extracellular loops of CD4 fused to CXCR4 (CD4-D4-X4) allowed gene transfer into HIV-1 envelope expressing cells by vectors based on either MLV or lentiviruses. The CD4-D2-X4 hybrid receptor, containing the first two extracellular CD4 domains, allowed gene transfer only by lentiviral vectors. Attempts to increase vector titres by deletion of the intracellular part of CXCR4 failed. Vector titres obtained by hybrid receptors were slightly lower than published titres obtained by separate expression of CD4 and CXCR4. Thus, CD4-D4-CXCR4 hybrids are useful for the generation of retroviral and lentiviral vectors with specificity for HIV-1 envelope expressing cells.","['Bittner, Alexandra', 'Mitnacht-Kraus, Rita', 'Schnierle, Barbara S']","['Bittner A', 'Mitnacht-Kraus R', 'Schnierle BS']","['Georg-Speyer-Haus, Institute for Biomedical Research, Paul-Ehrlich-Strasse 42-44, D-60596, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Netherlands,J Virol Methods,Journal of virological methods,8005839,"['0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (Fusion Proteins, gag-pol)', '0 (Gene Products, rev)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (rev Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus)']",IM,"['CD4 Antigens/*genetics', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Fusion Proteins, gag-pol/*genetics', 'Gene Products, rev/genetics', '*Genetic Vectors/genetics', 'HIV-1/*genetics', 'Humans', '*Lentivirus/genetics', '*Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics', 'Receptors, CXCR4/*genetics', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics', '*Transduction, Genetic', 'rev Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus']",2002/05/22 10:00,2002/08/06 10:01,['2002/05/22 10:00'],"['2002/05/22 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/06 10:01 [medline]', '2002/05/22 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0166093402000435 [pii]', '10.1016/s0166-0934(02)00043-5 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol Methods. 2002 Jun;104(1):83-92. doi: 10.1016/s0166-0934(02)00043-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This results in a high number of fragments to be analyzed by DGGE so that the analysis of large sample sets becomes labor intensive and time consuming. To address this problem, we have developed a new strategy for mutation analysis, lexon-DGGE, which combines the joining of different exons by PCR (also known as lexons) with a highly sensitive technique such as DGGE to screen for mutations. The lexon technique is based on the concatenation of several exons, adjacent or not, from genomic DNA into a single DNA fragment so that this approach could simultaneously be used to check the mutational status of several small genes. To show the feasibility of the approach, we have used the lexon-DGGE technique to analyze all coding exons, intron-exon junctions, noncoding exon 1, and part of the noncoding region of exon 11 of the TP53 gene. The validity and performance of the technique were confirmed by using negative and positive controls for each of the DNAfragments analyzed.","['Agirre, X', 'Garcia-Delgado, M', 'Calasanz, M J', 'Larrayoz, M J', 'Novo, F J', 'Vizmanos, J L']","['Agirre X', 'Garcia-Delgado M', 'Calasanz MJ', 'Larrayoz MJ', 'Novo FJ', 'Vizmanos JL']","['University of Navarra, Pamplona, Spain.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biotechniques,BioTechniques,8306785,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['DNA Mutational Analysis/methods', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Electrophoresis/methods', 'Exons/*genetics', 'Genetic Testing/*methods', 'Humans', 'Introns/genetics', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Nucleic Acid Denaturation', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/*genetics']",2002/05/22 10:00,2002/11/26 04:00,['2002/05/22 10:00'],"['2002/05/22 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/11/26 04:00 [medline]', '2002/05/22 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.2144/02325rr01 [doi]'],ppublish,"Biotechniques. 2002 May;32(5):1064-5, 1068-70. doi: 10.2144/02325rr01.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The human TFAR19 encodes a protein which shares significant homology to the corresponding proteins of species ranging from yeast to mice. TFAR19 exhibits a ubiquitous expression pattern and its expression is upregulated in tumor cells undergoing apoptosis. Overexpression of TFAR19 could enhance apoptosis of some tumor cells induced by growth factor withdrawal or serum deprivation. But the exact mechanism of TFAR19 is unclear. Mitochondria not only provides energy for the cell, but also plays a critical role on cell death or survival. The release of apoptosis promoting factor, such as cytochrome c from mitochondria, resulted by the damage of mitochondrial membrane integrity, is the key factor controlling apoptosis. The permeability transition pore (PTP) of mitochondria is a protein complex located between the mitochondrial membranes, and it plays an important role in regulating the integrity of mitochondrial membrane. In this study, the effect of recombinant TFAR19 on isolated mitochondrial PTP, membrane potential, and release of cytochrome c was investigated in vitro. The results indicated that recombinant TFAR19 facilitated the isolated mitochondrial PTP opening, decreased the membrane potential, and promoted the release of cytochrome c. The effect of TFAR19 on mitochondria is implemented by opening the mitochondrial PTP. Experimental results implicate that TFAR19 may positively feedback apoptosis signal of mitochondria, forming a positive loop to promote apoptosis.","['Tian, H K', 'Xia, T', 'Jiang, C S', 'Zhang, H M', 'Wang, K', 'Li, X J']","['Tian HK', 'Xia T', 'Jiang CS', 'Zhang HM', 'Wang K', 'Li XJ']","['Department of Pharmacology, Peking University Health Science Center, Beijing 100083, China.']",['chi'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",China,Sheng Wu Hua Xue Yu Sheng Wu Wu Li Xue Bao (Shanghai),Sheng wu hua xue yu sheng wu wu li xue bao Acta biochimica et biophysica Sinica,20730160R,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (PDCD5 protein, human)', '0 (Pdcd5 protein, mouse)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'Cell Membrane Permeability/drug effects/physiology', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Membranes/drug effects/physiology', 'Male', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mitochondria, Liver/*drug effects/physiology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*pharmacology', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology']",2002/05/23 10:00,2002/06/25 10:01,['2002/05/23 10:00'],"['2002/05/23 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/06/25 10:01 [medline]', '2002/05/23 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Sheng Wu Hua Xue Yu Sheng Wu Wu Li Xue Bao (Shanghai). 2002 May;34(3):279-84.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We previously showed that murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from TNF receptor-associated factor 2 (Traf2) and Traf5 double-deficient (double knockout (DKO)) mice were highly susceptible to TNF-induced cell death. By functional cloning to rescue DKO MEFs from TNF-induced cell death, we have identified a novel gene, Bsac. BSAC is composed of N-terminal basic, SAP (SAF-A/B, Acinus, PIAS), and coiled-coil domains. BSAC is a nuclear protein, and overexpression of BSAC potently activates promoters containing A + T-rich sequences named CArG boxes. Domain mapping analysis revealed that both N-terminal basic and C-terminal proline-rich sequence are required for the transcriptional activity. Overexpression of BSAC in DKO MEFs partially inhibited TNF-induced cell death by suppressing activation of caspases. Interestingly, inhibition of TNF-induced cell death was not observed in DKO MEFs transfected with either N-terminal or C-terminal deletion mutant of BSAC, revealing an intimate correlation between transcriptional activity and antiapoptotic function. Recently, a human homologue of BSAC named MAL/MKL1 (megakaryocytic acute leukemia/megakaryoblastic leukemia-1) was identified as a fusion transcript generated by t(1,22) translocation in acute megakaryoblastic leukemia. Collectively, BSAC is a novel transcriptional activator with antiapoptotic function, which may be involved in the leukemogenesis.","['Sasazuki, Tomonari', 'Sawada, Taisuke', 'Sakon, Sachiko', 'Kitamura, Toshio', 'Kishi, Takuma', 'Okazaki, Tatsuma', 'Katano, Mitsuo', 'Tanaka, Masao', 'Watanabe, Mamoru', 'Yagita, Hideo', 'Okumura, Ko', 'Nakano, Hiroyasu']","['Sasazuki T', 'Sawada T', 'Sakon S', 'Kitamura T', 'Kishi T', 'Okazaki T', 'Katano M', 'Tanaka M', 'Watanabe M', 'Yagita H', 'Okumura K', 'Nakano H']","['Department of Immunology, Juntendo University School of Medicine, 2-1-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8421, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MRTFA protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Line', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Fibroblasts/metabolism', 'Gene Library', 'Genes, Reporter', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Models, Genetic', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nuclear Proteins/*biosynthesis/*chemistry', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion', 'Plasmids/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Time Factors', 'Tissue Distribution', 'Trans-Activators/*biosynthesis/*chemistry', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*metabolism']",2002/05/23 10:00,2002/09/11 10:01,['2002/05/23 10:00'],"['2002/05/23 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/11 10:01 [medline]', '2002/05/23 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M203190200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(20)70290-5 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2002 Aug 9;277(32):28853-60. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M203190200.

Long-term remissions are achieved in <50% of patients. There is hope that activation of specific antileukemic immune responses could efficiently eliminate minimal residual disease at the end of chemotherapy and decrease the frequency of relapses. It was demonstrated that AML leukemic blasts can acquire the morphology and phenotype of dendritic cells (DCs), i.e., differentiate into leukemic DCs. However, this method has limitations as a potential immunotherapy. The alternative approach for the induction of leukemia-specific cytotoxicity we explored in this study consisted of using DCs of nonleukemic origin, pulsed with autologous apoptotic leukemic blasts. We show that mature pulsed nonleukemic DCs were successfully generated from remission samples of all tested patients with minimal interindividual differences. Mature pulsed DCs were used as antigen-presenting cells for leukemia-specific CTL induction. Specific cytotoxic activity against autologous AML blasts was demonstrated. Tumor lysis was autologous blast specific, with no killing activity against allogeneic leukemic cells or autologous mature unpulsed DCs and was MHC class I and class II restricted. In one patient, autologous CTLs stimulated by leukemic DCs or pulsed nonleukemic DCs showed similar significant cytotoxic activity against autologous AML cells. These findings demonstrate the induction of leukemia-specific cytotoxic response by nonleukemic mature DCs cross-presenting apoptotic leukemic blasts and offer a complementary approach to the use of leukemic DCs. We believe that this strategy permits the generation of DC vaccines for the majority of patients with hematological malignancies.","['Spisek, Radek', 'Chevallier, Patrice', 'Morineau, Nadine', 'Milpied, Noel', 'Avet-Loiseau, Herve', 'Harousseau, Jean-Luc', 'Meflah, Khaled', 'Gregoire, Marc']","['Spisek R', 'Chevallier P', 'Morineau N', 'Milpied N', 'Avet-Loiseau H', 'Harousseau JL', 'Meflah K', 'Gregoire M']","['INSERM U419, Institut de Biologie, 9 Quai Moncousu, 44093 Nantes Cedex 01, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigen Presentation/*immunology', 'Apoptosis/*immunology', 'Dendritic Cells/*immunology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/*methods', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*immunology/pathology/therapy', 'Lymphocyte Culture Test, Mixed', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Remission Induction', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology']",2002/05/23 10:00,2002/07/12 10:01,['2002/05/23 10:00'],"['2002/05/23 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/07/12 10:01 [medline]', '2002/05/23 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 2002 May 15;62(10):2861-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These alterations are known to disrupt the function of genes that contribute to tumor initiation and progression. The mechanism underlying the appearance of these chromosomal alterations is poorly understood. Recent evidence suggests that altered nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) is associated with the incidence of chromosome abnormalities in mutant rodent cells. This pathway is thought to provide a major mechanism for the repair of double-strand breaks (DSB) in higher eukaryotes. Here, we show that in an in vitro assay for DSB end ligation, nuclear extracts prepared from cultured and primary myeloid leukemia cells show a 2-7-fold increase in end-ligation efficiency as compared with mobilized peripheral CD34+ blood progenitor cells (CD34+) and interleukin-2-stimulated peripheral blood lymphocytes from normal healthy donors (P < 0.001). Furthermore, using an in vitro plasmid LacZ gene reactivation assay to determine DSB repair fidelity, nuclear extracts prepared from myeloid leukemia cells showed an increased frequency of misrepair compared with normal control cells (P < 0.001). Most importantly, this misrepair in myeloid leukemia cells is associated with large deletions (30-400 bp) within the test plasmids used in our assay. These deletions were not observed using normal hematopoietic cells (<28 bp). Strikingly, we show that the NHEJ proteins, Ku70 and 86, are required for the deletions in myeloid leukemias because preincubating nuclear extracts from leukemic cells with antisera against Ku86 and Ku70 inhibits plasmid reactivation and restores the frequency and size of deletions to control levels. Our findings suggest that an overactive NHEJ system and, specifically, aberrant Ku70/86 activity is a candidate mechanism for chromosomal instability in myeloid leukemias.","['Gaymes, Terry J', 'Mufti, Ghulam J', 'Rassool, Feyruz V']","['Gaymes TJ', 'Mufti GJ', 'Rassool FV']","['Department of Haematological Medicine, Leukaemic Sciences Laboratories, The Rayne Institute, GKT School of Medicine, Denmark Hill, London SE5 9NU, UK.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antigens, Nuclear)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', 'EC 3.6.4.- (DNA Helicases)', 'EC 3.6.4.12 (XRCC5 protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.4.12 (Xrcc6 protein, human)', 'EC 4.2.99.- (Ku Autoantigen)']",IM,"['*Antigens, Nuclear', 'Chromosome Aberrations', '*DNA Damage', '*DNA Helicases', '*DNA Repair', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics/*metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*physiology', 'Dimerization', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Ku Autoantigen', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/*physiology']",2002/05/23 10:00,2002/07/12 10:01,['2002/05/23 10:00'],"['2002/05/23 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/07/12 10:01 [medline]', '2002/05/23 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 2002 May 15;62(10):2791-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We added G-CSF to EMA (EMA-G) for therapy of advanced high-risk AML patients. METHODS: High-risk AML was defined as refractory, relapsed or secondary to either an antecedent hematologic disorder or exposure to cytotoxic agents. The patients were treated with one course of EMA-G consisting of mitoxantrone and cytarabine on days 1-3, and etoposide and cytarabine on days 8-10. G-CSF was started on day 4 and continued until absolute neutrophil count recovered. RESULTS: Thirty patients were enrolled. The median age was 51 years (range, 25-75). Seventeen (61%) patients had unfavorable cytogenetic karyotypes. Twenty (69%) patients had secondary AML. Ten (34%) had relapsed disease. Four (14%) had refractory AML. Three (10%) patients died from febrile neutropenia and sepsis. Major non-hematologic toxicity included hyperbilirubimenia, renal insufficiency, mucositis, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, skin rash. A complete remission was achieved in 13 (46%) patients. Median overall survival was 9 months (range, 0.5-66). Median relapse-free survival (RFS) for those who had a CR was 3 months (range, 0.5-63) with RFS censored at the time of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation or peripheral stem cell transplantation for 6 of the patients. CONCLUSIONS: EMA-G is a safe and efficacious option for induction chemotherapy in advanced, high-risk AML patients. The activity of EMA may be increased if applied in patients with less advanced disease.","['He, Xing-Yue', 'Elson, Paul', 'Pohlman, Brad', 'Lichtin, Alan', 'Hussein, Mohamad', 'Andresen, Steve', 'Kalaycio, Matt']","['He XY', 'Elson P', 'Pohlman B', 'Lichtin A', 'Hussein M', 'Andresen S', 'Kalaycio M']","['Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, Ohio USA. hes@ccf.org']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Count', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitoxantrone/administration & dosage', 'Neutrophils/drug effects', 'Platelet Count', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",2002/05/23 10:00,2002/10/31 04:00,['2002/05/23 10:00'],"['2002/02/22 00:00 [received]', '2002/05/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/05/23 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/10/31 04:00 [medline]', '2002/05/23 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1186/1471-2407-2-12 [doi]'],epublish,BMC Cancer. 2002 May 9;2:12. doi: 10.1186/1471-2407-2-12.,,20020509,PMC113260,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They can facilitate copper-promoted oxidative double-strand (ds) DNA cleavage through reductive activation of Cu(II). This is triggered by oxidation of the electron-rich Prod molecule and may provide a basis for the cytotoxicity of the prodigiosins. To gain an understanding of this activity, we prepared several Prod analogues with various A-ring systems to examine their electrochemical properties in acetonitrile (MeCN) as a means to establish a basis for structure-reactivity relationships in copper-promoted nuclease activity. The intact bipyrrole (BP) chromophore is critical for the copper-mediated nuclease properties of the Prods. In fact, simple BP systems are shown to facilitate oxidative single-strand (ss) DNA cleavage. Replacement of the Prod A-pyrrole ring with alternative arenes (phenyl, furan-2-yl, or thiophen-2-yl) inhibits DNA strand scission and raises the half-peak oxidation potential (E(p/2)) of the Prod free base [E(p/2) = 0.44 V vs saturated calomel electrode (SCE) in MeCN] by ca. 200 mV. The same effect was achieved through attachment of an electron-withdrawing group (acetyl) at the 5'-position of the A-pyrrole ring. The structural modifications that inhibit DNA cleavage correlate with known structure-reactivity relationships of Prods against leukemia and melanoma cancer cells. The implications of our findings with regard to the cytotoxicity of the Prods are discussed.","['Melvin, Matt S', 'Calcutt, M Wade', 'Noftle, Ronald E', 'Manderville, Richard A']","['Melvin MS', 'Calcutt MW', 'Noftle RE', 'Manderville RA']","['Department of Chemistry, Wake Forest University, Winston-Salem, North Carolina 27109-7486, USA.']",['eng'],['R15-GM59628/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Chem Res Toxicol,Chemical research in toxicology,8807448,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Pyrroles)', '789U1901C5 (Copper)', 'EC 3.1.- (Endodeoxyribonucleases)', 'EC 3.1.21.- (cleavase)', 'OL369FU7CJ (Prodigiosin)']",IM,"['Anti-Bacterial Agents/*chemical synthesis/chemistry', 'Copper/pharmacology', 'Electrochemistry', 'Endodeoxyribonucleases/chemistry/drug effects', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Prodigiosin/*analogs & derivatives/chemical synthesis', 'Pyrroles/*chemical synthesis/chemistry', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",2002/05/23 10:00,2002/09/06 10:01,['2002/05/23 10:00'],"['2002/05/23 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/06 10:01 [medline]', '2002/05/23 10:00 [entrez]']","['tx025508p [pii]', '10.1021/tx025508p [doi]']",ppublish,Chem Res Toxicol. 2002 May;15(5):742-8. doi: 10.1021/tx025508p.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using atomic absorption spectroscopy, we have measured the rate of uptake of arsenic trioxide and of antimony tartrate in GLC4 and GLC4/ADR cells overexpressing MRP1 and the rate of their MRP1-mediated effluxes as a function of the intracellular GSH concentration. In sensitive cells, after 1 h, a pseudosteady state is reached where intra- and extracellular concentrations of metalloid are the same. This precludes the formation, at short term, of complexes between arsenic or antimony with GSH. In resistant cells reduced intracellular accumulation of arsenic (or antimony), reflecting an increased rate of arsenic (or antimony) efflux from the cells, is observed. No efflux of the metalloid is observed in GSH depleted cells. The two metalloids and GSH are pumped out by MRP1 with the same efficiency. Moreover for the three compounds 50% of the efflux is inhibited by 2 microM MK571. This led us to suggest that As- and Sb-containing species could be cotransported with GSH.","['Salerno, Milena', 'Petroutsa, Maria', 'Garnier-Suillerot, Arlette']","['Salerno M', 'Petroutsa M', 'Garnier-Suillerot A']","['Laboratoire de Physicochimie Biornoleculaire et Cellulaire (UMR CNRS 7033), Universite Paris Nord, Bobigny, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Bioenerg Biomembr,Journal of bioenergetics and biomembranes,7701859,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Oxides)', '9IT35J3UV3 (Antimony)', 'DL6OZ476V3 (Antimony Potassium Tartrate)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'N712M78A8G (Arsenic)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)', 'Y49M64GZ4Q (multidrug resistance-associated protein 1)']",IM,"['Antimony/*pharmacokinetics', 'Antimony Potassium Tartrate/pharmacokinetics', 'Arsenic/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/pharmacokinetics', 'Biological Transport, Active', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Glutathione/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Oxides/pharmacokinetics', 'Spectrophotometry, Atomic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/05/23 10:00,2002/11/26 04:00,['2002/05/23 10:00'],"['2002/05/23 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/11/26 04:00 [medline]', '2002/05/23 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1023/a:1015180026665 [doi]'],ppublish,J Bioenerg Biomembr. 2002 Apr;34(2):135-45. doi: 10.1023/a:1015180026665.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The methods used for the reconstruction of doses were physical simulation and biological dosimetry by dicentric chromosomes in peripheral lymphocytes. Compared to the Bremen laboratory control the mean frequency of dicentric chromosomes in the lymphocytes of the seven volunteers was significantly elevated.

Both viruses may infect the same flock, the same bird and the same cell. In a double-infected cell, the retroviral DNA can integrate into the cellular or the Marek's disease virus (MDV) genome. The retroviral-long terminal repeat (LTR) integration into MDV was first described by Isfort et al., (Proc Natl Acad Sci 89, 991-995, 1992) following tissue culture co-infection. The recombinant virus isolated, RM1, had altered biological properties compared to the parental MDV (Witter R.L., Li D., Jones D., and Kung H.-J., Avian Dis 41, 407-421, 1997) . The issue of retroviral sequence integration into herpesviruses in vivo, in cases of double-virus infection is of wide significance in general virology and veterinary medicine; it also represents a special case of gene transposition. Using the avian system, we aimed to determine occurrence of such integrations in vivo. Chickens were experimentally co-infected with both avian leukosis virus (ALV) subgroup J and with MDV. To demonstrate the presence of the retroviral LTR in the MDV genome we applied the Hot Spot-combined PCR assay (Borenshtain R. and Davidson I., J Virol Meth 82, 119-127, 1999) that consisted of two consecutive steps of amplification. By that HS-cPCR assay, certain MDV genomic sites, defined as HS for integration were specifically amplified, the HS step, and then subjected to screening in an attempt to detect LTR inserts. The screening was achieved by amplification using heterologous primer sets, one for the MDV hot spot and the other for the retroviral LTR, the cPCR step. The products were Southern blotted and hybridized with MDV and ALV-LTR probes. Chimeric molecules were detected and evidenced by an intense signal in 3/10 chickens and weakly in other 3/10 birds. Detection was by LTR amplification, sequencing and multiple alignment to the ALV-J-LTR sequence. The present study indicated that chimeric molecules were produced in vivo.","['Davidson, I', 'Borenshtain, R', 'Kung, H J', 'Witter, R L']","['Davidson I', 'Borenshtain R', 'Kung HJ', 'Witter RL']","['Division of Avian Diseases, Kimron Veterinary Institute, Bet Dagan, Israel. iritd_vs@netvision.net.il']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Virus Genes,Virus genes,8803967,['0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Avian Leukosis/*complications/virology', 'Avian Leukosis Virus/*genetics/pathogenicity', 'Chickens/virology', 'Mardivirus/*genetics/pathogenicity', 'Marek Disease/*complications', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Poultry Diseases/virology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Terminal Repeat Sequences/*genetics', '*Virus Integration']",2002/05/23 10:00,2002/11/26 04:00,['2002/05/23 10:00'],"['2002/05/23 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/11/26 04:00 [medline]', '2002/05/23 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1023/a:1014528818179 [doi]'],ppublish,Virus Genes. 2002 Mar;24(2):173-80. doi: 10.1023/a:1014528818179.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study was conducted to screen possible cancer sites associated with this polymorphism by a prevalent case-control design. METHODS: The cases were 102 patients with esophageal cancer, 143 with stomach cancer, 74 with colon cancer, 72 with rectal cancer, 192 with lung cancer, 237 with breast cancer, 56 with prostate cancer, and 108 with malignant lymphoma. Controls consisted of outpatients from two sources: 241 noncancer outpatients who underwent gastroscopy and 399 first-visit outpatients, expected to include about 20% with cancer. Genotyping was conducted by polymerase chain reaction with confronting two-pair primers (PCR-CTPP). RESULTS: The TT genotype with null enzyme activity was found in 19.9% of the 241 noncancer gastroscopy examinees, 16.5% of the 399 first-visit outpatients, 12.7% of the esophageal cancer patients, 16.8% of the stomach cancer patients, 13.5% of the colon cancer patients, 9.7% of the rectal cancer patients, 17.7% of the lung cancer patients, 14.3% of the breast cancer patients, 16.1% of the prostate cancer patients, and 15.7% of the malignant lymphoma patients. The odds ratios (ORs) of the genotypes were not significant for any cancers combined or for any site of cancer, except for lung cancer (OR, 0.66; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.46-0.96 for CT relative to CC). The OR of current smoking for cancers of the esophagus and lung combined was different between the CC genotype (OR, 2.06; 95% CI, 1.06-3.98) and TT genotype (OR, 5.11; 95% CI, 1.37-19.05), although the difference was not significant. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that the CC genotype of the NQO1 C609T polymorphism is associated with the risk of lung cancer, and that the TT genotype increases the risk of smoking for cancers of the esophagus and lung.","['Hamajima, Nobuyuki', 'Matsuo, Keitaro', 'Iwata, Hiroji', 'Shinoda, Masayuki', 'Yamamura, Yoshitaka', 'Kato, Tomoyuki', 'Hatooka, Shunzo', 'Mitsudomi, Tetsuya', 'Suyama, Motokazu', 'Kagami, Yoshitoyo', 'Ogura, Michinori', 'Ando, Manabu', 'Sugimura, Yoshiki', 'Tajima, Kazuo']","['Hamajima N', 'Matsuo K', 'Iwata H', 'Shinoda M', 'Yamamura Y', 'Kato T', 'Hatooka S', 'Mitsudomi T', 'Suyama M', 'Kagami Y', 'Ogura M', 'Ando M', 'Sugimura Y', 'Tajima K']","['Division of Epidemiology and Prevention, Aichi Cancer Center Research Institute, 1-1 Kanokoden, Chikusa-ku, Nagoya 464-8681, Japan. nhamajim@aichi-cc.jp']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Int J Clin Oncol,International journal of clinical oncology,9616295,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', 'EC 1.6.5.2 (NAD(P)H Dehydrogenase (Quinone))']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/*enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Alleles', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/*enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'DNA Primers/chemistry', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Female', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'NAD(P)H Dehydrogenase (Quinone)/*genetics/metabolism', 'Odds Ratio', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Risk Factors', 'Sex Factors', 'Smoking/adverse effects']",2002/05/23 10:00,2002/11/26 04:00,['2002/05/23 10:00'],"['2002/05/23 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/11/26 04:00 [medline]', '2002/05/23 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s101470200013 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Clin Oncol. 2002 Apr;7(2):103-8. doi: 10.1007/s101470200013.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

TPO and platelet values were assayed weekly in AML patients undergoing HDT. A parsimonious dynamic model was then applied to these experimental data. The results (1) support the proposed model of TPO regulation, (2) model and quantify the effects of HDT on the megakaryocyte compartment, (3) characterize variables not amenable to direct measurement, and (4) have clinical utility as this model predicted that TPO given after HDT would not have a significant effect on platelet recovery, a finding borne out in clinical trials.

However, the mutation rate remains controversial. One possible reason is variation in the source material (DNA or RNA), with most studies having been done using tumor DNA. Accordingly, we studied BCL10 mutations using tumor RNA. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty lymphoid malignancies (26 malignant lymphomas, 10 chronic lymphocytic leukemias and 14 acute lymphoblastic leukemias) were examined. Total RNA was extracted from the tumor cells and first-strand cDNA was subjected to single-strand conformation polymorphism and fragment length analysis. Then the results were confirmed by direct sequencing. RESULTS: No mutations of the BCL10 gene were found in the 50 samples. There were four polymorphisms (3G to T, 24G to C, 485C to T and 638G to A). All samples showed at least one 24C allele. CONCLUSION: The BCL10 mutations studied are rare events at the RNA level and may not be associated with the mechanism of tumorigenesis in most lymphoid tumors.","['Kawano, Takeshi', 'Iwase, Satsuki', 'Nakayama, Ritsuko', 'Horiguchi-Yamada, Junko', 'Kobayashi, Masayuki', 'Yamada, Hisashi']","['Kawano T', 'Iwase S', 'Nakayama R', 'Horiguchi-Yamada J', 'Kobayashi M', 'Yamada H']","['Department of Molecular Genetics, Institute of DNA Medicine, Jikei University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan. kawano-t@jikei.ac.jp']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (B-Cell CLL-Lymphoma 10 Protein)', '0 (BCL10 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['*Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'B-Cell CLL-Lymphoma 10 Protein', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Lymphoma/*genetics', '*Mutation', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational', 'RNA, Messenger/*genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA']",2002/05/23 10:00,2002/06/26 10:01,['2002/05/23 10:00'],"['2002/05/23 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/06/26 10:01 [medline]', '2002/05/23 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2002 Jan-Feb;22(1A):305-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the group of initial Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) samples, equivalent cytotoxicity values for glufosfamide, 4-HOO-ifosfamide, 4-HOO-cyclophosphamide and mafosfamide were 5.95, 9.92, 4.60 and 3.90 microg/ml, respectively. In comparison to initial ALL samples, the relative resistance for glufosfamide and 4-HOO-ifosfamide in relapsed ALL samples were 1.9 (p=0.049) and 1.3 (ns), and in initial Acute Myeloblastic Leukemia (AML) samples, respectively, 31 (p<0.001) and 5 (p=0.001).

In multiple myeloma, malignant growth is mediated either by paracrine interleukin-6 (IL-6) elaborated by bone marrow stromal cells or via autocrine loops by malignant myeloma cells themselves. Although melphalan is one of the most active drugs in this tumor entity, the development of drug resistance frequently impedes cure of patients by attenuating melphalan-induced DNA-damage. We analyzed whether IL-6 protects XG-1 cells and plasma cells of a patient suffering from end-stage multiple myeloma (plasma cell leukemia) from melphalan with respect to DNA damage and DNA repair. Investigating the housekeeping gene glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) by using a PCR-stop assay, we found that there was more DNA damage in the G6PD gene of IL-6 deprived XG-1 and the patient's plasma cells, respectively, than in those with IL-6 supplementation. After cessation of melphalan exposure and 24 hours post-incubation in melphalan-free medium, DNA repair was observed in the patient's plasma cells but not in XG-1 cells. There was more DNA repair with IL-6 addition than without IL-6 addition. Similarly, the apoptotic cell fractions, as measured by flow cytometry, were lower if IL-6 was added to the medium. These results indicate that IL-6 may contribute to drug resistance in multiple myeloma.","['Efferth, Thomas', 'Fabry, Ursula', 'Osieka, Rainhardt']","['Efferth T', 'Fabry U', 'Osieka R']","['Medizinische Klinik IV, RWTH Aachen, Germany. efferth@vcrp.de']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', 'EC 1.1.1.49 (Glucosephosphate Dehydrogenase)', 'Q41OR9510P (Melphalan)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', '*DNA Damage', 'DNA Repair/*drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Interactions', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Glucosephosphate Dehydrogenase/genetics', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/*pharmacology', 'Melphalan/*pharmacology', 'Multiple Myeloma/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Plasma Cells/drug effects', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2002/05/23 10:00,2002/06/26 10:01,['2002/05/23 10:00'],"['2002/05/23 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/06/26 10:01 [medline]', '2002/05/23 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2002 Jan-Feb;22(1A):231-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In cases where the difference between results by the two methods was >100/microl, a positive correlation was found between the difference value and the blood reticulocyte count (r = 0.39, p = 0.002). Hematopoietic recovery after stem cell transplantation in a group of patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) was different from that of non-CML groups. In the CML group, the initial leukocyte counts were higher and the number of days until neutrophil recovery was higher than in the non-CML groups. Also, the day on which the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) exceeds 100/microl could serve as an indicator of neutrophil recovery. This study shows that the undiluted erythrocyte lysing technique can be used to count leukocytes accurately, especially in severely leukopenic samples. This new method can detect neutrophil recovery at ANC > 100/microl, as well as at an earlier date than the conventional method.","['Kim, Myungshin', 'Kim, Ja Young', 'Lim, Jihyang', 'Kim, Yonggoo', 'Han, Kyungja', 'Kang, Chang Suk', 'Min, Chang Kee', 'Kim, Chun Choo', 'Lee, Wonbae', 'Kim, Byung Kee']","['Kim M', 'Kim JY', 'Lim J', 'Kim Y', 'Han K', 'Kang CS', 'Min CK', 'Kim CC', 'Lee W', 'Kim BK']","['Department of Clinical Pathology, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Ann Clin Lab Sci,Annals of clinical and laboratory science,0410247,,IM,"['Erythrocytes/*immunology', 'Evaluation Studies as Topic', 'Hematopoiesis/immunology', 'Hemolysis/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*immunology/therapy', 'Leukocyte Count/methods', 'Neutrophils/*cytology', '*Stem Cell Transplantation']",2002/05/23 10:00,2002/11/26 04:00,['2002/05/23 10:00'],"['2002/05/23 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/11/26 04:00 [medline]', '2002/05/23 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Ann Clin Lab Sci. 2002 Spring;32(2):159-63.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although IHT has the advantage of low toxicity, it has not been developed as an anticancer drug because of its very low content in the plant. The cell apoptosis induced by isoharringtonine was investigated in human acute promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells by agarose gel electrophoresis of DNA, flow cytometry and transmission electron microscopy. In these experiments IHT showed significant and rapid apoptotic inductive effect on HL-60 cells in both concentration- and time-dependent fashion. The characteristic apoptosis-related features could be seen in IHT treated HL-60 cells. Transmission electron microscopy of IHT treated HL-60 cells displayed chromatin condensation and aggregation under the nuclear membrane, nuclear fragmentation and apoptosis body formation. Typical DNA ladder in agarose gel electrophoresis and pre-G1 peak in flow cytometric analysis were also observed in the cells exposed to IHT. The apoptotic rate could reach 43.8% in the HL-60 cells treated for 120 minutes with IHT 10(-7) mol.L-1. The cytotoxicity of IHT paralleled with cell apoptosis indicating that the anticancer activity of IHT results from the induction of apoptosis.

RESULTS: The study included eight patients, seven men and one woman, ranging in age from 28 to 67 years (mean age 46 years). All patients had histopathologically proved necrotizing Aspergillus of the large airways and no other superimposed infections. Six patients had leukemia, one had chronic liver disease, and one had chronic obstructive lung disease. All patients had bronchial wall thickening and focal bronchial narrowing involving a lobar or segmental bronchus. The bronchial narrowing was irregular or nodular in seven patients and smooth in one. Atelectasis distal to a narrowed bronchus was present in five patients. CONCLUSION: The CT findings of necrotizing bronchial aspergillosis include bronchial wall thickening, which is often nodular, and narrowing of the bronchial lumen, which is often associated with distal atelectasis.","['Franquet, Tomas', 'Serrano, Felix', 'Gimenez, Ana', 'Rodriguez-Arias, Jose Manuel', 'Puzo, Carmen']","['Franquet T', 'Serrano F', 'Gimenez A', 'Rodriguez-Arias JM', 'Puzo C']","['Department of Radiology, Hospital de Sant Pau, Avda Sant Antoni Ma Claret, Barcelona, Spain. 19429tfc@comb.es']",['eng'],,"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Comput Assist Tomogr,Journal of computer assisted tomography,7703942,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Airway Obstruction/diagnostic imaging/pathology', 'Aspergillosis/*diagnostic imaging/pathology', 'Biopsy', 'Bronchi/pathology', 'Bronchial Diseases/*diagnostic imaging/pathology', 'Bronchography', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lung/diagnostic imaging/pathology', 'Lung Diseases, Fungal/*diagnostic imaging/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Necrosis', 'Pulmonary Atelectasis/diagnostic imaging/pathology', '*Tomography, X-Ray Computed']",2002/05/23 10:00,2002/06/19 10:01,['2002/05/23 10:00'],"['2002/05/23 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/06/19 10:01 [medline]', '2002/05/23 10:00 [entrez]']","['00004728-200205000-00004 [pii]', '10.1097/00004728-200205000-00004 [doi]']",ppublish,J Comput Assist Tomogr. 2002 May-Jun;26(3):342-5. doi: 10.1097/00004728-200205000-00004.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

GADD34 binds to protein phosphatase-1 (PP1) and can attenuate translational elongation of key transcriptional factors through dephosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor-2alpha. We reported previously that the human trithorax leukemia fusion protein (HRX) can bind to GADD34 and abrogate GADD34-mediated apoptosis in response to UV irradiation. We found that hSNF5/INI1, a component of the hSWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, also binds to GADD34 and can coexist with GADD34 and HRX fusion proteins as a trimolecular complexes in vivo. In the present report, we demonstrate that hSNF5/INI1 binds to GADD34 in part through the PP1 docking site within a domain homologous to herpes simplex virus-1 ICP34.5. We found that hSNF5/INI1 can bind PP1 independently and weakly stimulate its phosphatase activity in solution and in complex with GADD34. hSNF5/INI1 and PP1 do not compete for binding to GADD34 but rather form a stable heterotrimeric complex with GADD34. We also show that Epstein-Barr nuclear protein 2, which binds hSNF5/INI1, can disrupt hSNF5/INI1 binding to GADD34 and partially reverse the GADD34-mediated growth suppression function in Ha-ras expressing HIH-3T3 (3T3-ras) cells. These results implicate hSNF5/INI1 in the function of GADD34 and suggest that hSNF5/INI1 may regulate PP1 activity in vivo.","['Wu, Daniel Y', 'Tkachuck, Douglas C', 'Roberson, Rachel S', 'Schubach, William H']","['Wu DY', 'Tkachuck DC', 'Roberson RS', 'Schubach WH']","['Division of Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, Veterans Administration Puget Sound Health Care System, Seattle Division, Seattle, Washington 98108, USA. danielw@u.washington.edu']",['eng'],['5K08CA71928-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (SMARCB1 Protein)', '0 (SMARCB1 protein, human)', '0 (Smarcb1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (PPP1R15A protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Phosphoprotein Phosphatases)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Ppp1r15a protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Protein Phosphatase 1)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antigens, Differentiation', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival', 'Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Peptide Fragments/chemistry/metabolism', 'Phosphoprotein Phosphatases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Protein Phosphatase 1', 'Proteins/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'SMARCB1 Protein', 'Transcription Factors', 'Transfection']",2002/05/23 10:00,2002/09/17 10:01,['2002/05/23 10:00'],"['2002/05/23 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/17 10:01 [medline]', '2002/05/23 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M200955200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)66232-0 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2002 Aug 2;277(31):27706-15. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M200955200.

In the present study, we evaluated the anti-inflammatory and chemopreventive potentials of ZER in a variety of cell culture experiments. ZER effectively suppressed TPA-induced superoxide anion generation from both NADPH oxidase in dimethylsulfoxide-differentiated HL-60 human acute promyelocytic leukemia cells and xanthine oxidase in AS52 Chinese hamster ovary cells. The combined lipopolysaccharide- and interferon-gamma-stimulated protein expressions of inducible nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, together with the release of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, in RAW 264.7 mouse macrophages were also markedly diminished. These suppressive events were accompanied with a combined decrease in the medium concentrations of nitrite and prostaglandin E(2), while the expression level of COX-1 was unchanged. ZER inhibited the proliferation of human colonic adenocarcinoma cell lines (LS174T, LS180, COLO205, and COLO320DM) in a dose-dependent manner, while the growth of normal human dermal (2F0-C25) and colon (CCD-18 Co) fibroblasts was less affected. It also induced apoptosis in COLO205 cells, as detected by dysfunction of the mitochondria transmembrane, Annexin V-detected translocation of phosphatidylserine, and chromatin condensation. Intriguingly, alpha-humulene, a structural analog lacking only the carbonyl group in ZER, was virtually inactive in all experiments conducted, indicating that the alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl group in ZER may play some pivotal roles in interactions with unidentified target molecule(s). Taken together, our results indicate that ZER is a food phytochemical that has distinct potentials for use in anti-inflammation, chemoprevention, and chemotherapy strategies.","['Murakami, Akira', 'Takahashi, Daisuke', 'Kinoshita, Takashi', 'Koshimizu, Koichi', 'Kim, Ha Won', 'Yoshihiro, Akira', 'Nakamura, Yoshimasa', 'Jiwajinda, Suratwadee', 'Terao, Junji', 'Ohigashi, Hajime']","['Murakami A', 'Takahashi D', 'Kinoshita T', 'Koshimizu K', 'Kim HW', 'Yoshihiro A', 'Nakamura Y', 'Jiwajinda S', 'Terao J', 'Ohigashi H']","['Department of Biotechnological Science, Faculty of Biology-Oriented Science and Technology, Kinki University, Wakayama 649-6493, Japan. murakami@bio.waka.kindai.ac.jp']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Carcinogenesis,Carcinogenesis,8008055,"['0 (Anticarcinogenic Agents)', '0 (Free Radicals)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Sesquiterpenes)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '11062-77-4 (Superoxides)', '471-05-6 (zerumbone)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (NOS2 protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (Nitric Oxide Synthase)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (Nitric Oxide Synthase Type II)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (Cyclooxygenase 2)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (PTGS2 protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthases)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/metabolism/pathology', 'Animals', 'Anticarcinogenic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Division/*drug effects', 'Colonic Neoplasms/metabolism/pathology', 'Cyclooxygenase 2', '*Free Radicals', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Nitric Oxide Synthase/metabolism', 'Nitric Oxide Synthase Type II', 'Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthases/metabolism', 'Sesquiterpenes/*pharmacology', 'Superoxides/metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism']",2002/05/23 10:00,2002/06/22 10:01,['2002/05/23 10:00'],"['2002/05/23 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/06/22 10:01 [medline]', '2002/05/23 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/carcin/23.5.795 [doi]'],ppublish,Carcinogenesis. 2002 May;23(5):795-802. doi: 10.1093/carcin/23.5.795.,,,,['Carcinogenesis. 2002 Nov;23(11):1961; author reply 1963.

Recently several statistical methods have been proposed to accomplish this goal when there are replicated samples under each condition. However, it may not be clear how these methods compare with each other. Our main goal here is to compare three methods, the t-test, a regression modeling approach (Thomas et al., Genome Res., 11, 1227-1236, 2001) and a mixture model approach (Pan et al., http://www.biostat.umn.edu/cgi-bin/rrs?print+2001,2001a,b) with particular attention to their different modeling assumptions. RESULTS: It is pointed out that all the three methods are based on using the two-sample t-statistic or its minor variation, but they differ in how to associate a statistical significance level to the corresponding statistic, leading to possibly large difference in the resulting significance levels and the numbers of genes detected. In particular, we give an explicit formula for the test statistic used in the regression approach. Using the leukemia data of Golub et al. (Science, 285, 531-537, 1999), we illustrate these points. We also briefly compare the results with those of several other methods, including the empirical Bayesian method of Efron et al. (J. Am. Stat. Assoc., to appear, 2001) and the Significance Analysis of Microarray (SAM) method of Tusher et al. (PROC: Natl Acad. Sci.

METHODS: Twenty-seven children who were treated for ALL were studied clinically 5 years after the cessation of therapy by means of motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) elicited by magnetic stimulation transcranially and peripherally. An equal number of healthy children matched with regard to age, gender, and height served as the control group. RESULTS: The MEP latencies to the hands and legs elicited by stimulation at the cortex were prolonged significantly in the children treated for ALL compared with the control group, with the differences being 2.2 milliseconds [ms] (P < 0.001) from the cortex to the thenar on the right side and 2.0 ms (P < 0.001) on the left, and 1.4 ms (P = 0.004) from the cortex to the leg on the right side and 1.3 ms (P = 0.004) on the left. Correspondingly, the MEP latency from the fifth lumbar vertebrae (LV) level to the leg also was prolonged, by 1.0 ms (P = 0.005) on the right side and 0.8 ms (P = 0.005) on the left side. The calculated latency between the cortex and the LV level was not found to be significantly longer in those patients treated for ALL compared with the healthy controls. Neurologic signs, in the form of depressed deep tendon reflexes, were observed in 8% of the patients, whereas approximately 33% of the patients were found to have fine or gross motor difficulties and dysdiadochokinesia. CONCLUSIONS: Neurologic signs still persisted 5 years after therapy for ALL. Approximately 33% of the patients had fine or gross motor difficulties and dysdiadochokinesia, and demyelinative injuries to the peripheral nerve tracts were found proximally but not within the central nervous system.","['Lehtinen, Satu S', 'Huuskonen, Usko E', 'Harila-Saari, Arja H', 'Tolonen, Uolevi', 'Vainionpaa, Leena K', 'Lanning, B Marjatta']","['Lehtinen SS', 'Huuskonen UE', 'Harila-Saari AH', 'Tolonen U', 'Vainionpaa LK', 'Lanning BM']","['Department of Pediatrics, Oulu University Central Hospital, Oulu, Finland. satu.lehtinen@oulu.fi']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Arm/innervation', 'Child', 'Evoked Potentials, Motor', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leg/innervation', 'Male', 'Motor Neuron Disease/*etiology/physiopathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications', 'Time Factors']",2002/05/17 10:00,2002/06/14 10:01,['2002/05/17 10:00'],"['2002/05/17 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/06/14 10:01 [medline]', '2002/05/17 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.10503 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2002 May 1;94(9):2466-73. doi: 10.1002/cncr.10503.,,,,,,,,,['Copyright 2002 American Cancer Society.DOI 10.1002/cncr.10503'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The translocation (9;22) in CML-N results in the transcription of an e19/a2 type BCR/ABL mRNA that codes for a 230-kD BCR/ABL protein (p230). The indolence of the clinical course of patients with CML-N has been disputed. METHODS: The objectives of this study were to quantify and correlate with clinical outcome the p230 mRNA and protein in patients with CML-N, to describe six new patients and the follow-up (with molecular analysis) of five previously reported patients with CML-N, and to review characteristics of all patients with CML-N and p230 BCR/ABL reported to date in the literature. RESULTS: Quantitative polymerase chain reaction assays on specimens from the great majority of patients with CML-N revealed minimal numbers of molecules of p230 BCR/ABL transcripts per total RNA. This also was associated with a lack of detectable p230 BCR/ABL protein in patient specimens, even in one patient who was followed for 16 years after diagnosis. This may explain the milder leukemic phenotype in most patients with CML-N. A review of all 23 patients who had an e19/a2 type BCR/ABL translocation suggested that the low level of p230 BCR/ABL mRNA and the lack of detectable p230 BCR/ABL protein in patients with no additional cytogenetic abnormalities may predict their indolent clinical course. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with p230 positive CML-N have indolent course, probably as a result of low p230 mRNA and protein levels. This supports the need to conduct additional molecular studies, even if cytogenetic studies have revealed t(9;22), because of the prognostic importance of the molecular findings.","['Verstovsek, Srdan', 'Lin, Hui', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Saglio, Giuseppe', 'De Micheli, Daniela', 'Pane, Fabrizio', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Intrieri, Mariano', 'Rotoli, Bruno', 'Salvatore, Francesco', 'Guo, Jie Q', 'Talpaz, Moshe', 'Specchia, Giorgina', 'Pizzolo, Gianni', 'Liberati, Anna Marina', 'Cortes, Jorge', 'Quackenbush, Robert C', 'Arlinghaus, Ralph B']","['Verstovsek S', 'Lin H', 'Kantarjian H', 'Saglio G', 'De Micheli D', 'Pane F', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Intrieri M', 'Rotoli B', 'Salvatore F', 'Guo JQ', 'Talpaz M', 'Specchia G', 'Pizzolo G', 'Liberati AM', 'Cortes J', 'Quackenbush RC', 'Arlinghaus RB']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.

METHODS: The authors identified seven cases of such CD56(+)TdT(+) blastic tumors presenting in skin at their institution. The authors correlated clinical course with histomorphology and immunophenotype. RESULTS: All 7 patients (6 men, 1 woman, 52-85 years) presented with rapidly growing, frequently multiple cutaneous nodules. All patients had low level bone marrow involvement at diagnosis and frequently had lymph node involvement. Tumor cells were of intermediate size with irregular nuclear contours, fine chromatin, and indistinct small nucleoli. The expression of TdT varied between 5% and over 90% of the neoplastic cell population. Tumor cells were negative for surface CD3, CD5, and CD20 in all cases, but some patients showed expression of CD2 (three out of five), cytoplasmic CD3 (two out of seven), CD4 (six out of seven), and CD16 (three out of seven). Molecular studies showed absence of T-cell receptor gene rearrangements in all cases. All seven patients had rapid progression of disease, and six patients have died of their disease or complications. Three patients developed progressively increasing numbers of bone marrow blasts that had a myeloid immunophenotype and were negative for TdT and CD56.

A reversible activation of gadolinium-blockable mechanogated currents in response to negative pressure application was found in 58 % of stable patches (n = 317). I-V relationships measured with a sodium-containing pipette solution showed slight inward rectification. Data analysis revealed the presence of two different populations of channels that were distinguishable by their conductance properties (17.2 +/- 0.3 pS and 24.5 +/- 0.5 pS), but were indistinguishable with regard to their selective and pharmacological properties. Ion-substitution experiments indicated that MS channels in leukaemia cells were permeable to cations but not to anions and do not discriminate between Na(+) and K(+). The channels were fully impermeable to large organic cations such as Tris(+) and N-methyl-D-glucamine ions (NMDG(+)). Ca(2+) permeation and blockade of MS channels were examined using pipettes containing different concentrations of Ca(2+). In the presence of 2 mM CaCl(2), when other cations were impermeant, both outward and inward single-channel currents were observed; the I-V relationship showed a unitary conductance of 7.7 +/- 1.0 pS. The relative permeability value, P(Ca)/P(K), was equal to 0.75, as estimated at physiological Ca(2+) concentrations. Partial or full inhibition of inward Ca(2+) currents through MS channels was observed at higher concentrations of external Ca(2+) (10 or 20 mM). No MS channels were activated when using a pipette containing 90 mM CaCl(2).

RESULTS: K562/A02 cells displayed high levels of mdr1 mRNA and P-glycoprotein and reduced DNR retention compared to their parental K562 cells. 1 micromol/L of PSC 833 had no effect on the levels of mdr1 mRNA and P-gp expression in K562/A02 cells (P > 0.05).

METHODS: Immunophenotyping was performed by three-color flow cytometry analysis using CD(45)/SSC gating. RESULTS: The percentage of blasts was correlated better with leukemic cell count compared with that of FSC/SSC, and the false positive results were low. Among eighty six cases of ALL, 95.3% was B-ALL, in which common-ALL and Pro-B-ALL were 76.8% and 6.1%, respectively, and 2.3% was T-ALL. CD(34)(+) and myeloid-associated antigen expression were observed in 57.0% and 34.9% of the cases, respectively, among which Pro-B-ALL was the commonest. CD(33) was more commonly expressed than CD(13) in Pro-B-ALL cases, but no difference in the expression between these two antigens in other subtypes.

We compared outcomes and toxicities in 712 patients with ALL (517 URD, 195 Auto) in first complete remission (CR1) or second complete remission (CR2) who underwent transplantation. All patients were <50 years old, although URD patientswere younger (median age, 14 versus 18 years, P < .002). The proportion of patients in CR1 versus CR2 was similar (36% versus 38%, P = .57), but more URD recipients than Auto recipients had high-risk karyotypes (25% versus 13%, P = .003) and white blood cell (WBC) counts > or =50 x 10(9)/L (33% versus 14%, P < .001). Engraftment was similar in URD and Auto recipients. Ex vivo purging delayed but did not prevent engraftment after Auto transplantation. Transplantation-related mortality was higher after URD transplantation (42%+/-8%) than after Auto transplantation (20%+/-12%) in CR1 (P = .004) and also in CR2. Conversely, relapse was more frequent after Auto transplantation in CR1 (Auto, 49%+/-12% versus URD, 14%+/-5%) and CR2 (64%+/-8% versus 25%+/-5%) (P < .0001). These findings showed net similar outcomes for these 2 transplantation choices. Transplantation in CR1 yielded similar 3-year survival rates for URD (51%+/-7%) and Auto (44%+/-12%), as did transplantation in CR2 (40%+/-6% versus 32%+/-9%, respectively). Multivariate regression analysis identified significantly better disease-free survival after the first 6 months in matched URD versus Auto in younger patients, in those in CR2 with CR1 >1year, WBC <50 x 10(9)/L, performance status > or =90%, and in those who have undergone transplantation since 1995. These comparative data suggest that both matched URD and Auto transplantation can yield extended survival. Although URD transplantation offers substantially better protection against leukemic relapse, improvements in allotransplantation safety and refinements in patient selection are required to better aid treatment decision making for the best overall survival.","['Weisdorf, Daniel', 'Bishop, Michael', 'Dharan, Bernie', 'Bolwell, Brian', 'Cahn, Jean Yves', 'Cairo, Mitchell', 'Giralt, Sergio', 'Klein, John', 'Lazarus, Hillard', 'Litzow, Mark', 'Marks, David', 'McCarthy, Philip', 'Miller, Carole', 'Milone, Gustavo', 'Russell, James', 'Schultz, Kirk R', 'Sierra, Jorge', 'Wiernik, Peter', 'Keating, Armand', 'Loberiza, Fausto', 'Kollman, Craig', 'Horowitz, Mary']","['Weisdorf D', 'Bishop M', 'Dharan B', 'Bolwell B', 'Cahn JY', 'Cairo M', 'Giralt S', 'Klein J', 'Lazarus H', 'Litzow M', 'Marks D', 'McCarthy P', 'Miller C', 'Milone G', 'Russell J', 'Schultz KR', 'Sierra J', 'Wiernik P', 'Keating A', 'Loberiza F', 'Kollman C', 'Horowitz M']","['University of Minnesota, the National Marrow Donor Program and the Autologous Blood and Marrow Transplant Registry, Minneapolis 55455, USA. weisd001@tc.umn.edu']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow Purging', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects/mortality', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Graft Survival', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Life Tables', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/mortality', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/mortality/*therapy', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Safety', 'Survival Analysis', 'Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation Conditioning', '*Transplantation, Autologous/adverse effects/immunology/mortality', '*Transplantation, Homologous/adverse effects/immunology/mortality', 'Treatment Outcome']",2002/05/17 10:00,2002/11/26 04:00,['2002/05/17 10:00'],"['2002/05/17 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/11/26 04:00 [medline]', '2002/05/17 10:00 [entrez]']","['S1083879102500434 [pii]', '10.1053/bbmt.2002.v8.pm12014810 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2002;8(4):213-20. doi: 10.1053/bbmt.2002.v8.pm12014810.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Arsenic trioxide (AS2O3), a clinically effective agent against acute promyelocytic leukemia, has been shown to induce apoptosis in a variety of cancer cells in vitro. Here, we investigated the effects of AS2O3 on the growth of two ER-positive breast cancer cell lines, MCF7 and T47D in vitro. We found that higher doses of AS2O3 dramatically reduced the survival of these two breast cancer cell lines while lower doses of AS2O3 significantly inhibited the expression of estrogen receptor alpha (ER-alpha), but did not effect ER-beta expression. The ER-alpha expression is totally restored when AS2O3 is absent for 24 hours. Using a reporter gene controlled by ER, we further demonstrated that AS2O3 strongly-repressed 17beta-estradiol (E2) stimulated-transcriptional activation. Moreover, AS2O3 abolished transcriptional induction of the estrogen responsive gene pS2 mediated by E2. These results indicated that AS2O3 specifically inhibits expression and signaling pathway of the ER-alpha. We suggest that AS2O3 in combination with other methods might provide a novel therapeutic approach for ER-alpha-positive breast cancer.","['Chen, Gui-Cai', 'Guan, Li-Shuang', 'Hu, Wei-Lian', 'Wang, Zhao-Yi']","['Chen GC', 'Guan LS', 'Hu WL', 'Wang ZY']","['School of Life Sciences, Zhejian University, Hangzhou, PR China.']",['eng'],"['CA 076632/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 084328/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Estrogen Receptor alpha)', '0 (Estrogen Receptor beta)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Estrogen)', '0 (TFF1 protein, human)', '0 (Trefoil Factor-1)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Estrogen Receptor alpha', 'Estrogen Receptor beta', 'Humans', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Proteins/genetics', 'Receptors, Estrogen/*antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/genetics/physiology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/physiology', 'Transcriptional Activation/drug effects/physiology', 'Trefoil Factor-1', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",2002/05/17 10:00,2002/06/28 10:01,['2002/05/17 10:00'],"['2002/05/17 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/06/28 10:01 [medline]', '2002/05/17 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2002 Mar-Apr;22(2A):633-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently the main cause of infection has changed from gram-negative to gram-positive bacteria and the resistance to antibiotics has increased. This study aimed to access the effectiveness of antimicrobial prophylaxis (AP) with orally absorbable antibiotics. METHODS: Ninety-five AML patients receiving chemotherapy at Catholic Hemopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Center from March 1999 to July 1999 were randomly divided into the AP group (250 mg ciprofloxacin twice a day, 150 mg roxithromycin twice a day, 50 mg fluconazole once a day) and the control group for a prospective analysis. RESULTS: The incidence of fever was 82.6% in the AP group and 91.6% in the control group (p = 0.15). Though classification and sites of infections showed no difference between the two groups, the catheter associated infection occurred more frequently in the AP group in significance. The time interval between initiation of chemotherapy and onset of fever, white blood cell (WBC) count at the onset of fever, duration of leukopenia (WBC < 1,000/mm3), duration of systemic antibiotic therapy, mortality due to infection and hospitalization period from the data starting chemotherapy showed no differences between the two groups. Infections due to gram negative bacteria decreased to 33.3% in the AP group (vs. 92% in the control group), but infections due to gram positive bacteria increased to 66.7% (vs. 8% in the control group). Gram negative bacteria showed 100% resistance to ciprofloxacin in the AP group and gram-positive bacteria showed 90-100% resistance to erythromycin, regardless of the presence of AP. CONCLUSION: The AP could not reduce the occurrence of infection or infection associated death in AML patients receiving chemotherapy. On considering increased gram-positive infection and resistance to fluoroquinolone and macrolide, routine prescription of AP should be reconsidered. Further studies that assess the effectiveness of AP in other malignancies, aplastic anemia and bone marrow transplantation are required.","['Lee, Dong Gun', 'Choi, Su Mi', 'Choi, Jung Hyun', 'Yoo, Jin Hong', 'Park, Yoon Hee', 'Kim, Yoo Jin', 'Lee, Seok', 'Min, Chang Ki', 'Kim, Hee Je', 'Kim, Dong Wook', 'Lee, Jong Wook', 'Min, Woo Sung', 'Shin, Wan Shik', 'Kim, Chun Choo']","['Lee DG', 'Choi SM', 'Choi JH', 'Yoo JH', 'Park YH', 'Kim YJ', 'Lee S', 'Min CK', 'Kim HJ', 'Kim DW', 'Lee JW', 'Min WS', 'Shin WS', 'Kim CC']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Catholic University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",Korea (South),Korean J Intern Med,The Korean journal of internal medicine,8712418,"['0 (Anti-Infective Agents)', '21KOF230FA (Roxithromycin)', '5E8K9I0O4U (Ciprofloxacin)', '8VZV102JFY (Fluconazole)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Anti-Infective Agents/*therapeutic use', '*Antibiotic Prophylaxis', 'Bacterial Infections/epidemiology/etiology/*prevention & control', 'Ciprofloxacin/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Female', 'Fever/epidemiology/etiology', 'Fluconazole/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutropenia/chemically induced/*complications', 'Prospective Studies', 'Roxithromycin/therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome']",2002/05/17 10:00,2002/06/11 10:01,['2002/05/17 10:00'],"['2002/05/17 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/06/11 10:01 [medline]', '2002/05/17 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.3904/kjim.2002.17.1.38 [doi]'],ppublish,Korean J Intern Med. 2002 Mar;17(1):38-44. doi: 10.3904/kjim.2002.17.1.38.,,,PMC4531660,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is reasonably speculated that the abnormalities in the signal transduction pathways for G-CSF could be partly responsible for the pathogenesis and the development to AML in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Therefore, we investigated the structural and functional abnormalities of the G-CSFR in 14 patients with MDS and 10 normal subjects. In in vitro colony forming assay, MDS samples showed reduced response to growth factors. However, G-CSF, but not GM-CSF and IL-3, enhanced clonal growth in three cases of high risk patients with MDS (RAEB, RAEB-t, and MDS having progressed to acute myeloid leukemia (AML)) and one low risk patient (RA). Eight out of 14 patients including above 4 patients demonstrated a common deletion of the G-CSFR cDNA; a deletion of three nucleotides (2128-2130) in the juxtamembrane domain of the G-CSFR, which resulted in a conversion of Asn(630)Arg(631) to Lys(630). To assess the functional activities of this deletion in the G-CSFR isoform, a mutant with the same three-nucleotide deletion was constructed by site-directed mutagenesis. FDCP-2 cells expressing the G-CSFR isoform responded to G-CSF, and exhibited proliferative responses than did those cells having wild-type G-CSFR. Moreover, these isoforms showed prolonged activation of STAT3 in response to G-CSF than did the wild-type. These results suggest that the deletion in the juxtamembrane domain of the G-CSFR gives a growth advantage to abnormal MDS clones and may contribute to the pathogenesis of MDS.","['Awaya, Norihiro', 'Uchida, Hideo', 'Miyakawa, Yoshitaka', 'Kinjo, Kentaro', 'Matsushita, Hiromichi', 'Nakajima, Hideaki', 'Ikeda, Yasuo', 'Kizaki, Masahiro']","['Awaya N', 'Uchida H', 'Miyakawa Y', 'Kinjo K', 'Matsushita H', 'Nakajima H', 'Ikeda Y', 'Kizaki M']","['Division of Hematology, Keio University School of Medicine, Shinanomachi, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence/genetics', 'Base Sequence/genetics', 'Cell Division/physiology', 'Clone Cells', 'DNA/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/physiology', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation/*physiology', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Receptors, Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*genetics', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'Trans-Activators/physiology']",2002/05/16 10:00,2002/06/26 10:01,['2002/05/16 10:00'],"['2002/05/16 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/06/26 10:01 [medline]', '2002/05/16 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.10102 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 2002 Jun;191(3):327-35. doi: 10.1002/jcp.10102.,,,,,,,,,"['Copyright 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The re-emergence of arsenic trioxide (ATO) in clinical use is due largely to purification of this compound from traditional mixtures, and the definition of effective, low-dose regimens for the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). ATO was first purified and used in controlled studies in patients with APL in China in the 1970s. Studies have subsequently also been performed in the United States. Complete response (CR) rates reported in patients with relapsed or refractory APL have varied from 52% to 92%, with similar rates reported in patients with newly diagnosed disease. The mechanism of action of ATO suggests it may be active against other malignancies, and ATO has shown some activity in patients with accelerated phase chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and multiple myeloma (MM).

Differentiation therapy with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) is used routinely in patients with APL, but ATRA is not the only agent in clinical use that promotes differentiation of the abnormal clone. Arsenic trioxide (ATO) has been shown to cause degradation of PML-RAR alpha, promoting differentiation. APL cells are extremely sensitive to ATO, which has shown good clinical activity at low doses in patients with relapsed APL. However, degradation of PML-RAR alpha may not be wholly responsible for the great sensitivity of APL cells to ATO, which also acts through the intracellular environment to influence apoptosis, differentiation, growth arrest, and angiogenesis. ATO can act at several points in mitochondrially induced apoptosis, including degradation of peroxides and interaction with glutathione (GSH)-related enzymes. Subclones that are resistant to ATO have been used to demonstrate that sensitivity can be restored by reducing the cellular GSH content. GSH can be reduced using agents such as buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) and ascorbic acid. The key factors that determine the ATO sensitivity of cells and control ATO-induced apoptosis have not yet been defined. It has been proposed that ATO acts through activation of Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), activator protein-1, and inhibition of dual-specificity phosphatases, and evidence is accumulating that JNK activation is an important event in arsenic-induced apoptosis. Further research is required to determine the exact pathways through which the cytotoxic actions of ATO are mediated.","['Davison, Kelly', 'Mann, Koren K', 'Miller, Wilson H Jr']","['Davison K', 'Mann KK', 'Miller WH Jr']","['Lady Davis Institute, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Semin Hematol,Seminars in hematology,0404514,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Glutathione/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', 'Oxides/*therapeutic use', 'Recurrence']",2002/05/16 10:00,2002/10/09 04:00,['2002/05/16 10:00'],"['2002/05/16 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/10/09 04:00 [medline]', '2002/05/16 10:00 [entrez]']","['ashem0390003b [pii]', '10.1053/shem.2002.33610 [doi]']",ppublish,Semin Hematol. 2002 Apr;39(2 Suppl 1):3-7. doi: 10.1053/shem.2002.33610.,,,,,,,16,,"['Copyright 2002, Elsevier Science (USA).

Here, a novel ST7-related gene ST7R (ST7-like, ST7L) was identified by using bioinformatics, and ST7R cDNAs were isolated by using cDNA-PCR. ST7R gene encoded 575-amino-acid polypeptide with leucine zipper domain and 3 tyrosine-phosphorylation sites. Human ST7R was homologous to human ST7 (72.1% total-amino-acid identity) and Drosophila CG3634 (56.8% total-amino-acid identity). Leucine zipper domain was unique to ST7R. Tyr 268 and Tyr 441 of ST7R were conserved in ST7 and CG3634. ST7R-homologous domains (S7H1, S7H2, and S7H3) were conserved among ST7R, ST7, and CG3634. ST7R gene consisted of at least 15 exons, and four ST7R isoforms were transcribed due to alternative splicing.

These results suggested that anthracycline anticancer agents induce apoptosis by interacting, at least in part, with proteasomes.","['Kiyomiya, Ken-Ichi', 'Kurebe, Masaru', 'Nakagawa, Hiroshi', 'Matsuo, Saburou']","['Kiyomiya K', 'Kurebe M', 'Nakagawa H', 'Matsuo S']","['Laboratory of Toxicology, Graduate School of Veterinary Medicine, Osaka Prefecture University, Sakai 599-8531, Japan. kiyomiya@vet.osakafu-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Leupeptins)', '0 (Multienzyme Complexes)', '0 (Ubiquitin)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'D58G680W0G (pirarubicin)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Casp3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)', 'RF1P63GW3K (benzyloxycarbonylleucyl-leucyl-leucine aldehyde)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/physiology', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/*physiology', 'Doxorubicin/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Leukemia L1210', 'Leupeptins/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Multienzyme Complexes/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex', 'Ubiquitin/metabolism']",2002/05/16 10:00,2002/08/30 10:01,['2002/05/16 10:00'],"['2002/05/16 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/30 10:01 [medline]', '2002/05/16 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2002 Jun;20(6):1205-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In adult brain, STB1 mRNA was more highly expressed in cerebellum, corpus callosum, amygdala, and medulla oblongata. STB1 mRNA was moderately expressed in K-562 (chronic myelogenous leukemia), G-361 (melanoma), and MKN7 (gastric cancer). On the other hand, STB1 mRNA was almost undetectable in several human cancer cell lines, and was down-regulated in 4 out of 14 cases of primary kidney tumors, and in 2 out of 3 cases of primary lung cancer.

DATA SOURCES: Published articles, abstracts, book chapters, manufacturer information, unpublished clinical trial data, and personal experiences with gemtuzumab ozogamicin. DATA SYNTHESIS: Conventional chemotherapy for AML is associated with toxicities that often limit treatment options when AML relapses. Gemtuzumab ozogamicin is a humanized recombinant anti-CD33 monoclonal antibody linked to calicheamicin, a potent cytotoxic agent. The antibody targets the CD33 antigen found on the surface of leukemic blast cells and myeloid precursors. This targeting effect reduces the toxicity of gemtuzumab ozogamicin. The efficacy and tolerability of gemtuzumab ozogamicin have been documented in relapsed AML, particularly in patients 60 years of age or older, who often have no other treatment options. As with other monoclonal antibody therapies, an ""infusion syndrome"" (i.e., fever and chills) may occur but can be managed effectively when administration guidelines are used. CONCLUSIONS: Gemtuzumab ozogamicin is the first of a new class of targeted therapies for the treatment of relapsed AML. A number of implications for nurses exist. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING: Nurses must be knowledgeable about gemtuzumab ozogamicin preparation and administration, patient selection and monitoring, and intervention procedures. This knowledge is necessary to accurately inform patients and their families of the possible course of treatment and potential side effects.","['Shannon-Dorcy, Kathleen']",['Shannon-Dorcy K'],"['Department of Clinical Research, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, USA. kshannon@FHCRC.org']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Oncol Nurs Forum,Oncology nursing forum,7809033,"['0 (Aminoglycosides)', '0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CD33 protein, human)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Aged', 'Aminoglycosides', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/*pharmacology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*pharmacology', 'Antigens, CD/*analysis', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/*analysis', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/diagnosis/*drug therapy/epidemiology/*nursing', 'Middle Aged', 'Monitoring, Physiologic', 'Patient Education as Topic', 'Patient Selection', 'Recurrence', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3']",2002/05/16 10:00,2002/05/30 10:01,['2002/05/16 10:00'],"['2002/05/16 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/05/30 10:01 [medline]', '2002/05/16 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1188/02.ONF.E52-E59 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncol Nurs Forum. 2002 May;29(4):E52-9. doi: 10.1188/02.ONF.E52-E59.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At the molecular level a fusion of part of the ABL and BCR genes is observed. The breakpoint locations in the BCR gene fall between exons b2a2 or b3a2 (5' and 3', respectively). Depending on the BCR gene breakpoint two types of mRNA are created. Differences in the types of transcripts and/or the breakpoint site may have an influence on the clinical course of the disease. This prompted the present author to separate subtypes of chronic myeloid leukemia on the molecular level. MATERIAL/METHODS: 71 patients diagnosed with chronic myeloid leukemia in the chronic phase were enrolled in the study. In 61 patients the type of BCR/ABL transcript was determined, and in 27 patients BCR breakpoints were established. Possible correlations between the clinical course, prognostic indexes, survival and the type of transcript and breakpoint were examined. RESULTS: No correlation between the clinical course, prognostic index, or survival was observed in patients with 5' and 3' breakpoints. The patients with b3a2 transcript experienced longer survival than the patients expressing b2a2 transcript. However, no significant differences were observed in the duration of the chronic phase between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: The type of BCR gene breakpoint seems to have no prognostic value in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia. The longer survival of patients expressing the b3a2 transcript may be caused by the less aggressive course of the accelerated or blastic phase.","['Prejzner, Witold']",['Prejzner W'],"['Department of Hematology, Medical University of Gdansk, Poland.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Med Sci Monit,Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research,9609063,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'DNA Damage', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*metabolism', 'Genes, abl/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/metabolism/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",2002/05/16 10:00,2002/11/01 04:00,['2002/05/16 10:00'],"['2002/05/16 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/11/01 04:00 [medline]', '2002/05/16 10:00 [entrez]']",['1837 [pii]'],ppublish,Med Sci Monit. 2002 May;8(5):BR193-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These leukemias are classified either as T prolymphocytic leukemias, which occur very late in life, or as T chronic lymphocytic leukemias, which often arise in patients with ataxia telangiectasia (AT) at a young age. In transgenic animals, the deregulated expression of TCL1 leads to mature T cell leukemia, demonstrating the role of TCL1 in the initiation of malignant transformation in T cell neoplasia. Expression of high levels of Tcl1 have also been found in a variety of human tumor-derived B cell lines ranging from pre-B cell to mature B cell. Here we describe the phenotype of transgenic mice, E mu-TCL1, established with TCL1 under the control of a V(H) promoter-Ig(H)-E mu enhancer to target TCL1 expression to immature and mature B cells. Flow cytometric analysis reveals a markedly expanded CD5(+) population in the peritoneal cavity of E mu-TCL1 mice starting at 2 mo of age that becomes evident in the spleen by 3-5 mo and in the bone marrow by 5-8 mo. Analysis of Ig gene rearrangements indicates monoclonality or oligoclonality in these populations, suggesting a preneoplastic expansion of CD5(+) B cell clones, with the elder mice eventually developing a chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)-like disorder resembling human B-CLL. Our findings provide an animal model for CLL, the most common human leukemia, and demonstrate that deregulation of the Tcl1 pathway plays a crucial role in CLL pathogenesis.","['Bichi, Roberta', 'Shinton, Susan A', 'Martin, Eric S', 'Koval, Anatoliy', 'Calin, George A', 'Cesari, Rossano', 'Russo, Giandomenico', 'Hardy, Richard R', 'Croce, Carlo M']","['Bichi R', 'Shinton SA', 'Martin ES', 'Koval A', 'Calin GA', 'Cesari R', 'Russo G', 'Hardy RR', 'Croce CM']","['Kimmel Cancer Center, Jefferson Medical College, 233 South 10th Street, Philadelphia, PA 19107, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (CD5 Antigens)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (TCL1A protein, human)', '0 (Tcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Aging', 'Animals', 'CD5 Antigens', 'Cell Cycle', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'G1 Phase', 'Gene Targeting', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains', 'Immunoglobulin M', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/etiology/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Plasmids', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Resting Phase, Cell Cycle', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism/*physiology']",2002/05/16 10:00,2002/06/19 10:01,['2002/05/16 10:00'],"['2002/05/16 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/06/19 10:01 [medline]', '2002/05/16 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1073/pnas.102181599 [doi]', '99/10/6955 [pii]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2002 May 14;99(10):6955-60. doi: 10.1073/pnas.102181599.,,,PMC124510,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cyclin D1 overexpression is a useful finding that supports the diagnosis of MCL. In this study, we used a 5' --> 3' exonuclease-based real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method to quantify cyclin D1 mRNA in 108 B-cell NHL and nonneoplastic specimens, including 25 cases of MCL. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was also quantified to normalize cyclin D1 mRNA levels, and the data were expressed as a cyclin D1 to GAPDH ratio. At each anatomic site, MCL cases had higher cyclin D1 levels than other types of NHL or nonneoplastic specimens, without overlap. For example, in lymph node specimens, the median cyclin D1/GAPDH ratio was 147 (range, 94-160) in MCL, compared with 8.6 (range, 4-18) in chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma; 5.8 (range, 1.8-24) in follicular lymphoma; 4.8 in one case of marginal zone lymphoma; and 20.2 (range, 5.8-44) in reactive specimens. Statistical analysis using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed that MCL cases had significantly higher cyclin D1 levels than other groups (P <.05). In peripheral blood specimens involved by MCL, cyclin D1 levels correlated with extent of involvement. We conclude that this real-time RT-PCR method to quantify cyclin D1 expression is helpful in distinguishing MCL from other types of B-cell NHL and from nonneoplastic specimens. This method is rapid, can be applied to the analysis of fluid specimens, and obviates the need for time-consuming and laborious detection methods that are required by traditional semi-quantitative RT-PCR methods.","['Medeiros, L Jeffrey', 'Hai, Seema', 'Thomazy, Vilmos A', 'Estalilla, Oscar C', 'Romaguera, Jorge', 'Luthra, Rajyalakshmi']","['Medeiros LJ', 'Hai S', 'Thomazy VA', 'Estalilla OC', 'Romaguera J', 'Luthra R']","['Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Mod Pathol,"Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc",8806605,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow/metabolism/pathology', 'Cyclin D1/*genetics', 'Digestive System/metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Lymph Nodes/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/blood/genetics/*pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/*metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Spleen/metabolism/pathology', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/05/16 10:00,2002/07/24 10:01,['2002/05/16 10:00'],"['2002/05/16 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/07/24 10:01 [medline]', '2002/05/16 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/modpathol.3880562 [doi]'],ppublish,Mod Pathol. 2002 May;15(5):556-64. doi: 10.1038/modpathol.3880562.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP), defined as a variable pattern of hypermethylation of CpG islands in tumor suppressor genes, may be associated with carcinogenesis. To determine whether CIMP is associated with the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and with exposure to environmental agents, we examined the methylation status of CpG islands in HCCs from countries with various HCC risks. METHODS: We examined the methylation status of 12 CpG islands (eight for known genes) in 85 HCC tumors from various geographic locations by use of bisulfite-polymerase chain reaction methylation assays and analyzed results with univariate and multivariable methods. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: Eight CpG islands were hypermethylated. The frequency of hypermethylation in the 85 tumors was 62% for the estrogen receptor (ER), 42% for p16, 18% for cyclooxygenase-2, 21% for the T-type calcium channel gene, 38% for MINT31, 28% for MINT1, 15% for MINT27, and 11% for MINT2 (the latter four CpG islands are not yet associated with genes). Methylation levels of the eight frequently methylated CpG islands were positively correlated (from R =.2 [P =.05] to R =.6 [P<.001]), supporting the presence of CIMP. p16 methylation had statistically significant geographic variation (34.4% in tumors from China and Egypt versus 12.2% in tumors from the United States and Europe, difference = 22.2%; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 11.2% to 33.2%; P<.001). Similar geographic variations were observed for ER methylation and CIMP. This observation was partly related to higher methylation in tumors from patients with cirrhosis (33.6% for patients with cirrhosis versus 11.7% for those without it; difference = 21.9%; 95% CI = 10.9% to 32.8%; P<.001) or hepatitis (34.2% for patients with hepatitis versus 6.2% for those without it; difference = 28%; 95% CI = 18.3% to 37.6%; P<.001).

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Transfusion-dependent patients with NHL (n = 106), CLL (n = 126), or MM (n = 117) and a low serum erythropoietin concentration were randomized to receive epoetin beta 150 IU/kg or placebo subcutaneously three times a week for 16 weeks. Primary efficacy criteria were transfusion-free and transfusion- and severe anemia-free survival (hemoglobin [Hb] > 8.5 g/dL) between weeks 5 to 16. Response was defined as an increase in Hb > or = 2 g/dL with elimination of transfusion need. QOL was assessed by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy scale. RESULTS: Transfusion-free (P =.0012) survival and transfusion- and severe anemia-free survival (P =.0001) were significantly greater in the epoetin beta group versus placebo (Wald chi(2) test), giving a relative risk reduction of 43% and 51%, respectively. The response rate was 67% and 27% in the epoetin beta versus the placebo group, respectively (P <.0001). After 12 and 16 weeks of treatment, QOL significantly improved in the epoetin beta group compared with placebo (P <.05); this improvement correlated with an increase in Hb concentration (> or = 2 g/dL). A target Hb that could be generally recommended could not be identified. CONCLUSION: Many severely anemic and transfusion-dependent patients with advanced MM, NHL, and CLL and a low performance status benefited from epoetin therapy, with elimination of severe anemia and transfusion need, and improvement in QOL.","['Osterborg, Anders', 'Brandberg, Y', 'Molostova, V', 'Iosava, G', 'Abdulkadyrov, K', 'Hedenus, M', 'Messinger, D']","['Osterborg A', 'Brandberg Y', 'Molostova V', 'Iosava G', 'Abdulkadyrov K', 'Hedenus M', 'Messinger D']","['Department of Oncology (Radiumhemmet), Karolinska Hospital, S-17176 Stockholm, Sweden. anders.osterborg@ks.se']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (epoetin beta)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Anemia/*drug therapy/etiology', 'Double-Blind Method', '*Erythropoietin/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Injections, Subcutaneous', 'Iron/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/complications/*drug therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/complications/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/complications/*drug therapy', 'Quality of Life', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome']",2002/05/16 10:00,2002/06/06 10:01,['2002/05/16 10:00'],"['2002/05/16 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/06/06 10:01 [medline]', '2002/05/16 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.2002.08.131 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2002 May 15;20(10):2486-94. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2002.08.131.,,,,,,['Epoetin Beta Hematology Study Group'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two hundred forty consecutive adult patients with AML entered onto the multicenter treatment trial AML HD93 were studied. Chromosome banding and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) applying a comprehensive set of genomic DNA probes were performed in a single reference laboratory. RESULTS: Two cases of inv(16), three cases of t(11q23), and three cases of t(8;21)var were only detected by molecular cytogenetics. By FISH, aberrations were identified in three cases with normal karyotypes: inv(16), -Y (in a patient with low metaphase yield on chromosome banding) and a 12p microdeletion. Additional aneuploidies, in particular +8q and +11q, were diagnosed by FISH; however, virtually all these aberrations occurred in patients with complex karyotypes or as an additional abnormality in leukemias with an AML-specific translocation. Finally, aberrations were detected by FISH in eight of 14 patients with no assessable metaphases. CONCLUSION: In most cases of AML, conventional cytogenetic study reliably detects chromosomal abnormalities, and this method should not be replaced by FISH. FISH should be used as a complementary method for the detection of more subtle abnormalities, such as inv(16) and t(11q23), in all patients with newly diagnosed AML and for suspected t(8;21)var. Furthermore, molecular cytogenetics using this comprehensive set of DNA probes provides a valuable diagnostic tool for patients with poor chromosome morphology, low or no yields of metaphase cells, or both.","['Frohling, Stefan', 'Skelin, Silvia', 'Liebisch, Claudia', 'Scholl, Claudia', 'Schlenk, Richard F', 'Dohner, Hartmut', 'Dohner, Konstanze']","['Frohling S', 'Skelin S', 'Liebisch C', 'Scholl C', 'Schlenk RF', 'Dohner H', 'Dohner K']","['Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital of Ulm, Robert-Koch-Strasse 8, 89081 Ulm, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosomes/*genetics', 'Cytogenetics', 'DNA Probes', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Biology', 'Prospective Studies', 'Translocation, Genetic']",2002/05/16 10:00,2002/06/06 10:01,['2002/05/16 10:00'],"['2002/05/16 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/06/06 10:01 [medline]', '2002/05/16 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.2002.08.155 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2002 May 15;20(10):2480-5. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2002.08.155.,,,,,,"['Acute Myeloid Leukemia Study Group, Ulm']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Previously untreated adults < or = 60 years old with ALL were treated with a four-agent induction chemotherapy regimen. This was followed by cyclical postremission therapy with high-dose cytarabine/etoposide; high-dose methotrexate/6-mercaptopurine; and daunorubicin, vincristine, prednisone, and asparaginase. Maintenance chemotherapy with oral methotrexate and 6-mercaptopurine was continued for 30 months. CNS prophylaxis was given with intrathecal methotrexate in addition to the systemic chemotherapy indicated above. RESULTS: Seventy-eight of 84 patients (93%) achieved complete remission. With a median follow-up of 5.6 years, 5-year event-free survival (EFS) of all remission patients is 52%. Patients with high-risk features including adverse cytogenetics, failure to achieve remission with the first cycle of chemotherapy, and B-precursor disease with WBC counts more than 100,000/microL all relapsed unless taken off study for transplantation. For patients without these high-risk features, 5-year EFS was 60%. Compared with our previous treatment regimen, results appear to be improved for patients with standard-risk B-precursor disease (5-year EFS, 66% v 34%; P =.01). CONCLUSION: Intensified and shortened chemotherapy may improve the outcome for patients with ALL with B-precursor disease lacking high-risk features.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred ninety-one patients (mean age, 67.5 years; 69% male) were randomized to receive either Aza C (75 mg/m(2) subcutaneous for 7 days every 4 weeks) or supportive care, with supportive care patients crossing over to Aza C upon disease progression. Quality of life was assessed by centrally conducted telephone interviews at baseline and days 50, 106, and 182. Overall quality of life, psychological state, and social functioning were assessed by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire C30 and the Mental Health Inventory (MHI). RESULTS: Patients on the Aza C arm experienced significantly greater improvement in fatigue (EORTC, P =.001), dyspnea (EORTC, P =.0014), physical functioning (EORTC, P =.0002), positive affect (MHI, P =.0077), and psychological distress (MHI, P =.015) over the course of the study period than those in the supportive care arm. Particularly striking were improvements in fatigue and psychological state (MHI) in patients treated with Aza C compared with those receiving supportive care for patients who remained on study through at least day 106, corresponding to four cycles of Aza C. Significant differences between the two groups in quality of life were maintained even after controlling for the number of RBC transfusions. CONCLUSION: Improved quality of life for patients treated with Aza C coupled with significantly greater treatment response and delayed time to transformation to acute myeloid leukemia or death compared with patients on supportive care (P <.001) establishes Aza C as an important treatment option for myelodysplastic syndrome.","['Kornblith, Alice B', 'Herndon, James E 2nd', 'Silverman, Lewis R', 'Demakos, Erin P', 'Odchimar-Reissig, Rosalie', 'Holland, James F', 'Powell, Bayard L', 'DeCastro, Carlos', 'Ellerton, John', 'Larson, Richard A', 'Schiffer, Charles A', 'Holland, Jimmie C']","['Kornblith AB', 'Herndon JE 2nd', 'Silverman LR', 'Demakos EP', 'Odchimar-Reissig R', 'Holland JF', 'Powell BL', 'DeCastro C', 'Ellerton J', 'Larson RA', 'Schiffer CA', 'Holland JC']","[""Women's Cancers Program, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Rm.

Supportive care is standard therapy. We previously reported that azacitidine (Aza C) was active in patients with high-risk MDS. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A randomized controlled trial was undertaken in 191 patients with MDS to compare Aza C (75 mg/m(2)/d subcutaneously for 7 days every 28 days) with supportive care. MDS was defined by French-American-British criteria. New rigorous response criteria were applied. Both arms received transfusions and antibiotics as required. Patients in the supportive care arm whose disease worsened were permitted to cross over to Aza C. RESULTS: Responses occurred in 60% of patients on the Aza C arm (7% complete response, 16% partial response, 37% improved) compared with 5% (improved) receiving supportive care (P <.001). Median time to leukemic transformation or death was 21 months for Aza C versus 13 months for supportive care (P =.007). Transformation to acute myelogenous leukemia occurred as the first event in 15% of patients on the Aza C arm and in 38% receiving supportive care (P =.001). Eliminating the confounding effect of early cross-over to Aza C, a landmark analysis after 6 months showed median survival of an additional 18 months for Aza C and 11 months for supportive care (P =.03). Quality-of-life assessment found significant major advantages in physical function, symptoms, and psychological state for patients initially randomized to Aza C. CONCLUSION: Aza C treatment results in significantly higher response rates, improved quality of life, reduced risk of leukemic transformation, and improved survival compared with supportive care. Aza C provides a new treatment option that is superior to supportive care for patients with the MDS subtypes and specific entry criteria treated in this study.","['Silverman, Lewis R', 'Demakos, Erin P', 'Peterson, Bercedis L', 'Kornblith, Alice B', 'Holland, Jimmie C', 'Odchimar-Reissig, Rosalie', 'Stone, Richard M', 'Nelson, Douglas', 'Powell, Bayard L', 'DeCastro, Carlos M', 'Ellerton, John', 'Larson, Richard A', 'Schiffer, Charles A', 'Holland, James F']","['Silverman LR', 'Demakos EP', 'Peterson BL', 'Kornblith AB', 'Holland JC', 'Odchimar-Reissig R', 'Stone RM', 'Nelson D', 'Powell BL', 'DeCastro CM', 'Ellerton J', 'Larson RA', 'Schiffer CA', 'Holland JF']","['Division of Medical Oncology, Mount Sinai School of Medicine and Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, Box 1129, One Gustave L.

Evidence for a regulatory component that controls activation of both CaT1 and CRAC (Ca(2+) release-activated Ca(2+) channel) channels.,26950-8,"The intestinal Ca(2+) transport protein CaT1 encoded by TRPV6 has been reported (Yue, L., Peng, J. B., Hediger, M. A., and Clapham, D. E. (2001) Nature 410, 705-709) to be all or a part of the Ca(2+) release-activated Ca(2+) channel (CRAC). The major characteristic of CRAC is its activation following store depletion. We expressed CaT1 in HEK293 cells and rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) mast cells and measured whole-cell currents by the patch clamp technique. In HEK293 cells, the expression of CaT1 consistently yielded a constitutively active current, the size of which was strongly dependent on the holding potential and duration of voltage ramps. In CaT1-expressing RBL cells, the current was either activated by store depletion or was constitutively active at a higher current density. CaT1 currents could be clearly distinguished from endogenous CRAC by their typical current-voltage relationship in divalent free solution. 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB), which is considered a blocker of CRAC, was tested for its inhibitory effect on both cell types expressing CaT1. Endogenous CRAC as well as store-dependent CaT1-derived currents of RBL cells were largely blocked by 75 microm 2-APB, whereas constitutively active CaT1 currents in both RBL and HEK293 cells were slightly potentiated. These results indicate that despite the difference in the permeation properties of CRAC and CaT1 channels, the latter are similarly able to form store depletion-activated conductances in RBL mast cells that are inhibited by 2-APB.","['Schindl, Rainer', 'Kahr, Heike', 'Graz, Ingrid', 'Groschner, Klaus', 'Romanin, Christoph']","['Schindl R', 'Kahr H', 'Graz I', 'Groschner K', 'Romanin C']","['Institute for Biophysics, University of Linz, A-4040 Linz, Austria.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Boron Compounds)', '0 (Calcium Channels)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (TRPV Cation Channels)', '0 (TRPV6 channel)', 'E4ES684O93 (2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Boron Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Calcium Channels/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA, Complementary/metabolism', 'Electrophysiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Mast Cells/*metabolism', 'Models, Biological', 'Rats', 'TRPV Cation Channels', 'Time Factors', 'Transfection']",2002/05/16 10:00,2002/08/23 10:01,['2002/05/16 10:00'],"['2002/05/16 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/23 10:01 [medline]', '2002/05/16 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M203700200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)60036-5 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2002 Jul 26;277(30):26950-8. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M203700200.

Genomic typing of HLA-A, -B, -C, -DRB1, and -DQB1 was retrospectively performed in 1298 donor-patient pairs in cases where marrow was donated from serologically HLA-A, -B, and -DR compatible donors. Single disparities of the HLA-A, -B, -C, or -DRB1 allele were independent risk factors for acute GVHD, and the synergistic effect of the HLA-C allele mismatch with other HLA allele mismatches on acute GVHD was remarkable. HLA-A and/or HLA-B allele mismatch was found to be a significant factor for the occurrence of chronic GVHD. HLA class I (A, B, and/or C) allele mismatch caused a significantly higher incidence of engraftment failure than HLA match. Significant association of HLA-C allele mismatch with leukemia relapse was not observed. As the result of these events, HLA-A and/or HLA-B allele mismatch reduced overall survival remarkably in both standard-risk and high-risk leukemia cases, whereas the HLA-C mismatch or HLA-class II (DRB1 and/or DQB1) mismatch did not. Furthermore, multiple mismatch of the HLA locus was found to reduce survival in leukemia cases. Thus, the role of the HLA class I allele in unrelated bone marrow transplantation was elucidated.

GVHD prophylaxis using WHI-P131 markedly improved the survival outcome after BMT. The probability of survival at 30 days after BMT was 11% +/- 6% for vehicle-treated recipients (median survival time, 25 days) versus 63% +/- 12% for recipients treated with WHI-P131 (median survival time, 36 days; P <.0001). Because WHI-P131 is devoid of antileukemic activity against BCL-1 leukemia cells, this marked improvement in survival outcome was due to reduced incidence of GVHD-associated fatalities combined with sustained GVL function of the allografts in the WHI-P131 group. Notably, adoptive transfer experiments demonstrated that the spleens of WHI-P131-treated allograft recipients contained less than 0.001% BCL-1 cells. Notably, GVHD prophylaxis with WHI-P131 plus methotrexate resulted in 100% survival of mice receiving allotransplants challenged with an otherwise invariably fatal dose of BCL-1 leukemia. Taken together, our results provide strong experimental evidence that GVHD prophylaxis using WHI-P131 does not impair the GVL function of the allografts and consequently contributes to an improved post-BMT survival outcome of the recipient mice.","['Uckun, Fatih M', 'Roers, Bertram A', 'Waurzyniak, Barbara', 'Liu, Xing-Ping', 'Cetkovic-Cvrlje, Marina']","['Uckun FM', 'Roers BA', 'Waurzyniak B', 'Liu XP', 'Cetkovic-Cvrlje M']","['Experimental BMT Program, Parker Hughes Cancer Center and Department of Immunology, Parker Hughes Institute, St Paul, MN 55113, USA. faith_uckun@ih.org']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Quinazolines)', '0 (WHI P131)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Jak3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/immunology/*physiology', 'Crosses, Genetic', 'Female', 'Graft Survival/drug effects/*physiology', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/drug effects/*physiology', 'Janus Kinase 3', 'Major Histocompatibility Complex', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Quinazolines/*pharmacology', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",2002/05/16 10:00,2002/07/02 10:01,['2002/05/16 10:00'],"['2002/05/16 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/07/02 10:01 [medline]', '2002/05/16 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood.v99.11.4192 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)60798-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2002 Jun 1;99(11):4192-9. doi: 10.1182/blood.v99.11.4192.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Diagnosis is primarily based on a particular immunophenotype with tumor cells expressing CD4 and CD56 antigens in the absence of common lymphoid or myeloid lineage markers. Little is currently known about the cytogenetic features of this disease entity. In this setting, the Groupe Francais de Cytogenetique Hematologique (GFCH) initiated a cytogenetic study of 18 adults and 3 children with CD4(+), CD56(+) DC2 acute leukemia using conventional and fluorescence in situ hybridization/24-color karyotyping. Clonal, mostly complex chromosome aberrations were found in 14 patients (66%). Six major recurrent chromosomal targets were defined. These were 5q, 12p, 13q, 6q, 15q, and 9, which were involved in 72% (5q), 64% (12p and 13q), 50% (6q), 43% (15q), and 28% (monosomy 9) of cases, respectively. Cytogenetic features can be summarized as follows: (1) gross genomic imbalances (mostly losses) predominate, (2) no single anomaly can be considered as specific, whereas their combination/accumulation is, and (3) both lymphoid and myeloid lineage-associated rearrangements are observed in unusual combinations in the same cell. This is suggestive of complex multistep tumorigenic mechanisms and is supportive of the hypothesis that CD4(+), CD56(+) DC2 acute leukemia may arise from an undifferentiated nonmyeloid nonlymphoid progenitor cell.

Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) promote JMML cell growth. A hyperactive function of the ras oncogene is a hallmark of JMML. We therefore targeted the protein kinase Raf-1 downstream of Ras using a DNA enzyme that degrades mRNA-Raf-1. Western blots of JMML cell lysates revealed phosphorylated Raf-1 protein, indicating constitutive activation. Addition of GM-CSF, but not TNF-alpha, increased phosphorylation of both Raf-1 and the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) JNK-1 and ERK-1. Depletion of Raf-1 protein markedly impaired activation of MAPKs, induced substantial inhibition of JMML cell colony formation, and virtually abolished GM-CSF hypersensitivity in JMML cells. Exogenous TNF-alpha, but not GM-CSF, restored colony formation of JMML cells pretreated with the enzyme. We could not detect any effect of the enzyme on the proliferation of normal bone marrow cells, indicating its specificity and potential safety. When immunodeficient mice engrafted with JMML cells were treated continuously with the enzyme via a peritoneal osmotic mini-pump for 4 weeks, a profound reduction in the JMML cell numbers in the recipient murine bone marrows was found. We conclude that GM-CSF is a chief regulator of JMML growth and exerts its proleukemic effects primarily via the Ras/Raf-1 signaling cascade. TNF-alpha plays a permissive role, being dependent upon GM-CSF to induce JMML cell proliferation. The DNA enzyme efficiently catabolized mRNA-Raf-1 with subsequent inhibition of JMML cell growth, suggesting its potential as a mechanism-based therapy in this fatal leukemia.","['Iversen, Per Ole', 'Emanuel, Peter D', 'Sioud, Mouldy']","['Iversen PO', 'Emanuel PD', 'Sioud M']","['Institute for Nutrition Research, University of Oslo, and Department of Immunology, Molecular Medicine Group, the Norwegian Radium Hospital, Oslo, Norway. poiversen@hotmail.com']",['eng'],['CA80916/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.7.7 (DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow Cells/cytology/drug effects', 'Breast Neoplasms', 'Cell Division', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/*metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/*pathology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf/*genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology']",2002/05/16 10:00,2002/07/02 10:01,['2002/05/16 10:00'],"['2002/05/16 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/07/02 10:01 [medline]', '2002/05/16 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood.v99.11.4147 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)60792-3 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2002 Jun 1;99(11):4147-53. doi: 10.1182/blood.v99.11.4147.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The constitutive activation of the P210(BCR-ABL) tyrosine kinase results in phosphorylation of multiple signaling pathways leading to the transformed phenotype. Additionally, extracellular interactions between P210(BCR-ABL)-expressing progenitor cells and bone marrow stroma may provide external signals that facilitate CML development. In contrast to the intracellular signaling pathways involved in CML, little is known about how P210(BCR-ABL) expression modifies cell-cell and cell-substratum interactions. To investigate the role of P210(BCR-ABL) in modulating cellular adhesion, we used a highly sensitive and quantitative cell detachment apparatus that measures the strength of association between a population of cells and an adhesive matrix. Our findings show that P210(BCR-ABL) expression increased adhesion nearly 2-fold between the myeloblastic cell line, 32D, and fibronectin compared to a control vector. We then investigated whether abnormal adhesion due to P210(BCR-ABL) expression was caused by its tyrosine kinase activity. A quantitative analysis of cell-fibronectin adhesion found that neither expression of a kinase-inactive P210(BCR-ABL) mutant in 32D cells or attenuation of kinase activity by STI571 (imatinib mesylate) in 32D cells transduced with wild-type P210(BCR-ABL) could correct the nearly 2-fold increase in cell-fibronectin adhesion. Similarly, STI571 treatment of Meg-01 cells, a P210(BCR-ABL)-expressing cell line derived from a patient in blast crisis, failed to inhibit adhesion to fibronectin. Together, our results indicate that changes in adhesion induced by P210(BCR-ABL) are independent of its tyrosine kinase activity.","['Wertheim, Jason A', 'Forsythe, Kevin', 'Druker, Brian J', 'Hammer, Daniel', 'Boettiger, David', 'Pear, Warren S']","['Wertheim JA', 'Forsythe K', 'Druker BJ', 'Hammer D', 'Boettiger D', 'Pear WS']","['Department of Bioengineering, Institute for Medicine and Engineering, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia 19104-6160, USA.']",['eng'],"['CA77570/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL18208/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Animals', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects/*physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 22', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/chemistry/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Megakaryocytes/drug effects/physiology', 'Mice', 'Piperazines', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Translocation, Genetic']",2002/05/16 10:00,2002/07/02 10:01,['2002/05/16 10:00'],"['2002/05/16 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/07/02 10:01 [medline]', '2002/05/16 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood.v99.11.4122 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)60789-3 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2002 Jun 1;99(11):4122-30. doi: 10.1182/blood.v99.11.4122.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

From the minimally deleted region, 3 candidate genes have been isolated, RFP2, BCMS, and BCMSUN. DNA sequence analyses have failed to detect small mutations in any of these genes, suggesting a different pathomechanism, most likely haploinsufficiency. We, therefore, tested B-CLL patients for epigenetic aberrations by measuring expression of genes from 13q14.3 and methylation of their promotor region. RB1, CLLD7, KPNA3, CLLD6, and RFP2 were down-regulated in B-CLL patients as compared with B cells of healthy donors, with RFP2 showing the most pronounced loss of expression. To test whether this loss of gene expression is associated with methylation of CpG islands in the respective promotor regions, we performed methylation-sensitive quantitative polymerase chain reaction analyses and bisulfite sequencing on DNA from B-CLL patients. No difference in the methylation patterns could be detected in any CpG island of the minimally deleted region. Down-regulation of genes within chromosomal band 13q14.3 in B-CLL is in line with the concept of haploinsufficiency, but this tumor-specific phenomenon is not associated with DNA methylation.","['Mertens, Daniel', 'Wolf, Stephan', 'Schroeter, Petra', 'Schaffner, Claudia', 'Dohner, Hartmut', 'Stilgenbauer, Stephan', 'Lichter, Peter']","['Mertens D', 'Wolf S', 'Schroeter P', 'Schaffner C', 'Dohner H', 'Stilgenbauer S', 'Lichter P']","['Abteilung ""Organisation komplexer Genome,"" Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum, Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Dinucleoside Phosphates)', ""2382-65-2 (cytidylyl-3'-5'-guanosine)""]",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Chromosome Banding', 'Chromosome Mapping', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 13', '*DNA Methylation', 'DNA Primers', 'Dinucleoside Phosphates/analysis', '*Gene Expression Regulation', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Lymphocytes', 'Reference Values', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2002/05/16 10:00,2002/07/02 10:01,['2002/05/16 10:00'],"['2002/05/16 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/07/02 10:01 [medline]', '2002/05/16 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood.v99.11.4116 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)60788-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2002 Jun 1;99(11):4116-21. doi: 10.1182/blood.v99.11.4116.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated in leukemic samples of children with T-ALL (n = 81) whether the different in vivo therapy response could be linked to differential in vitro susceptibility to apoptotic cell death. The extent of dexamethasone- as well as doxorubicin-induced apoptosis, detected by annexin V staining, positively correlated with the expression levels of CD1a (Spearman correlation coefficient, r(s) = 0.3 and 0.4, respectively; P <.01). When compared to cortical T-ALL, mature (CD1a(-), surface CD3(+)) T-ALL were significantly more resistant to doxorubicin, and immature, pro-/pre-T-ALL were more resistant to both drugs (P <.05). Apoptosis-related parameters (Bax, Bcl-2, CD95, and CD95-induced apoptosis) did not account for differential susceptibility to drug-induced apoptosis. By contrast, an interleukin 7-induced rescue of leukemic cells from spontaneous apoptosis, recently proposed to reflect distinct developmental stages and apoptotic programs in T-ALL, was highly associated with susceptibility to dexamethasone- but not doxorubicin-induced apoptosis (P <.001 versus P =.08). Analysis of clinical data showed that in vitro susceptibility to dexamethasone (but not to doxorubicin) closely correlated with early in vivo therapy response characterized by percentages of blast cells in bone marrow on day 15 (r(s) = -0.46, P =.001). Taken together, the in vitro assessment of drug-induced apoptosis revealed maturation-dependent differences within childhood T-ALL. The enhanced sensitivity to both drugs in cortical T-ALL might account for the better in vivo treatment response of this prognostically favorable T-ALL subgroup.","['Wuchter, Christian', 'Ruppert, Velia', 'Schrappe, Martin', 'Dorken, Bernd', 'Ludwig, Wolf-Dieter', 'Karawajew, Leonid']","['Wuchter C', 'Ruppert V', 'Schrappe M', 'Dorken B', 'Ludwig WD', 'Karawajew L']","['Department of Hematology, Oncology, and Tumor Immunology, Robert Rossle Cancer Center, Charite, Humboldt-University of Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD1)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (CD1a antigen)', '0 (CD2 Antigens)', '0 (CD33 protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-7)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/*analysis', 'Antigens, CD1/analysis', 'Antigens, CD34/analysis', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/analysis', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'CD2 Antigens/analysis', 'Child', 'Dexamethasone/*therapeutic use', 'Doxorubicin/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Interleukin-7/*pharmacology', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/immunology/pathology', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/05/16 10:00,2002/07/02 10:01,['2002/05/16 10:00'],"['2002/05/16 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/07/02 10:01 [medline]', '2002/05/16 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood.v99.11.4109 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)60787-X [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2002 Jun 1;99(11):4109-15. doi: 10.1182/blood.v99.11.4109.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

High-level infiltration of bone marrow, spleen, and liver was observed, with variable infiltration of other organs. The immunophenotypes of xenografts were essentially unaltered compared with the original patient sample. In addition, sequencing of the entire p53 coding region revealed no mutations in 14 of 14 xenografts (10 from patients at diagnosis and 4 at relapse). Cells harvested from the spleens of engrafted mice readily transferred the leukemia to secondary and tertiary recipients. To correlate biologic characteristics of xenografts with clinical and prognostic features of the patients, the rates at which individual leukemia samples engrafted in NOD/SCID mice were analyzed. Differences in biologic correlates were encountered depending on stage of disease: a direct correlation was observed between the rate of engraftment and length of CR1 for samples harvested at relapse (r = 0.96; P =.002), but not diagnosis (r = 0.38; P =.40). In contrast, the in vivo responses of 6 xenografts to vincristine showed a direct correlation (r = 0.96; P =.002) between the length of CR1 and the rate at which the leukemia cell population recovered following vincristine treatment, regardless of whether the xenografts were derived from patients at diagnosis or relapse. This study supports previous findings that the NOD/SCID model of childhood ALL provides an accurate representation of the human disease and indicates that it may be of value to predict relapse and design alternative treatment strategies in a patient-specific manner.","['Lock, Richard B', 'Liem, Natalia', 'Farnsworth, Monica L', 'Milross, Christopher G', 'Xue, Chengyuan', 'Tajbakhsh, Mayamin', 'Haber, Michelle', 'Norris, Murray D', 'Marshall, Glenn M', 'Rice, Alison M']","['Lock RB', 'Liem N', 'Farnsworth ML', 'Milross CG', 'Xue C', 'Tajbakhsh M', 'Haber M', 'Norris MD', 'Marshall GM', 'Rice AM']","[""Children's Cancer Institute Australia for Medical Research; School of Paediatrics, University of New South Wales, Australia. richard.lock@unsw.edu.au""]",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,['5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/pathology/*physiopathology', 'Recurrence', 'T-Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vincristine/toxicity']",2002/05/16 10:00,2002/07/02 10:01,['2002/05/16 10:00'],"['2002/05/16 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/07/02 10:01 [medline]', '2002/05/16 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood.v99.11.4100 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)60786-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2002 Jun 1;99(11):4100-8. doi: 10.1182/blood.v99.11.4100.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, to evaluate the possibility that B-CLL cells resemble antigen-experienced and activated B cells, we analyzed the expression of markers of cellular activation and differentiation on CD5(+)CD19(+) cells from B-CLL patients and from age-matched healthy donors. The leukemic cells from all B-CLL patients, including those that lack significant numbers of V gene mutations, bear the phenotype of activated B cells based on the overexpression of the activation markers CD23, CD25, CD69, and CD71 and the underexpression of CD22, Fcgamma receptor IIb, CD79b, and immunoglobulin D that are down-regulated by cell triggering and activation. Furthermore, these leukemic cells resemble antigen-experienced lymphocytes in the underexpression of molecules that are down-regulated by cell triggering and in the uniform expression of CD27, an identifier of memory B cells. A comparison of the phenotypes of B-CLL patients with and without immunoglobulin V gene mutations suggests that the 2 subgroups differ both in specific marker expression (CD69, CD71, CD62 L, CD40, CD39, and HLA-DR) and in the time since antigenic stimulation, based on the reciprocal relationship of CD69 and CD71 expression.

Loss-of-function studies have shown that SCL is essential for the formation of hematopoietic stem cells, for subsequent erythroid development and for yolk sac angiogenesis. SCL exhibits a highly conserved pattern of expression from mammals to teleost fish. Several murine SCL enhancers have been identified, each of which directs reporter gene expression in vivo to a subdomain of the normal SCL expression pattern. However, regulatory elements necessary for SCL expression in erythroid cells remain to be identified and the size of the chromosomal domain needed to support appropriate SCL transcription is unknown. Here we demonstrate that a 130-kilobase (kb) yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) containing the human SCL locus completely rescued the embryonic lethal phenotype of scl(-/-) mice. Rescued YAC(+) scl(-/-) mice were born in appropriate Mendelian ratios, were healthy and fertile, and exhibited no detectable abnormality of yolk sac, fetal liver, or adult hematopoiesis. The human SCL protein can therefore substitute for its murine homologue.

These FLT3/ITD mutations are likely to be important because their presence is associated with a poor prognosis. Both types of mutations appear to activate the tyrosine kinase activity of FLT3. We describe here the identification and characterization of the indolocarbazole derivative CEP-701 as a FLT3 inhibitor. This drug potently and selectively inhibits autophosphorylation of wild-type and constitutively activated mutant FLT3 in vitro in FLT3/ITD-transfected cells and in human FLT3-expressing myeloid leukemia-derived cell lines. We demonstrate that CEP-701 induces a cytotoxic effect on cells in a dose-responsive fashion that parallels the inhibition of FLT3. STAT5 and ERK1/2, downstream targets of FLT3 in the signaling pathway, are inhibited in response to FLT3 inhibition. In primary leukemia blasts from AML patients harboring FLT3/ITD mutations, FLT3 is also inhibited, with an associated cytotoxic response. Finally, using a mouse model of FLT3/ITD leukemia, we demonstrate that the drug inhibits FLT3 phosphorylation in vivo and prolongs survival.

Clinical features and outcome of 29 episodes.,535-41,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the characteristics of patients affected by hematologic malignancies who developed a chronic disseminated candidiasis (CDC), and to ascertain the factors that influenced the outcome, in a retrospective study conducted between January 1990 and December 2000, in 4 Hematology Divisions. DESIGN AND METHODS: CDC was diagnosed by clinical features combined with radiological and/or histologic and/or microbiological data. RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients (male/female 14/14; average age 42 years, range 12-67) developed a CDC. Twenty had acute myeloid leukemia, 5 had acute lymphocytic leukemia and 3 had non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. All patients received chemotherapy, including cytarabine for 21 of them (75%). Before the infection, 22 patients (79%) were neutropenic (absolute neutrophil count < 0.5 x 10(9)/L) for an average of 20 days (8-36), but at CDC diagnosis only 3 patients (11%) were neutropenic. Twenty-two patients (75%) received antifungal prophylaxis for an average of 15 days (10-60). Before diagnosis of CDC, 9 patients (32%) had a candidemia. The sites compromised by CDC were: liver in 27 patients (96%) and/or spleen in 11 patients (38%). Ten patients had other organs involved: lung in 6 patients (21%), kidney in 4 patients (14%), other sites 2 patients (7%). Abdominal ultrasonography was positive in 96% of patients (27/28), and abdominal computed tomography-scan was positive in 100% of cases in which it was performed (21/21). Liver biopsy was positive in 10/15 patients (67%). The main signs and symptoms were: fever 86%, abdominal pain 54%, diarrhea 32%, tenderness 25%, vomiting 25%, jaundice 29%, dysphagia 7%. Among chemical analyses, the most sensitive test was alkaline phosphatase, with a 3-5-fold increase in 24 patients (86%); an increase of liver transaminases and g-glutamyl transferase was observed in less than 50% of patients. By 30 days after diagnosis 4 patients had died, 1 from infection, and 3 progression of the hematologic malignancy without signs of active CDC. Within 3 months from diagnosis 14 out of the remaining 24 patients (58%) received further chemotherapy: in particular, 2 patients underwent transplantation procedures. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: In our experience CDC is not a fatal complication of patients with hematologic malignancy, on the contrary to that observed for other fungal infections (i.e. aspergillosis, candidemia), characterized by a higher mortality rate. The major problem of this fungal complication is correlated to the delay in the following treatment for the hematologic malignancy with a high risk of progression of malignancy.","['Pagano, Livio', 'Mele, Luca', 'Fianchi, Luana', 'Melillo, Lorella', 'Martino, Bruno', ""D'Antonio, Domenico"", 'Tosti, Maria Elena', 'Posteraro, Brunella', 'Sanguinetti, Maurizio', 'Trape, Giulio', 'Equitani, Francesco', 'Carotenuto, Mario', 'Leone, Giuseppe']","['Pagano L', 'Mele L', 'Fianchi L', 'Melillo L', 'Martino B', ""D'Antonio D"", 'Tosti ME', 'Posteraro B', 'Sanguinetti M', 'Trape G', 'Equitani F', 'Carotenuto M', 'Leone G']","['Department of Hematology, Catholic University, largo Francesco Vito 1, 00168 Rome, Italy. lpagano@rm.unicatt.it']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Candidiasis/*diagnosis/drug therapy/etiology', 'Child', 'Chronic Disease', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/complications/*microbiology/pathology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Opportunistic Infections/diagnosis/drug therapy/etiology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",2002/05/16 10:00,2003/08/02 05:00,['2002/05/16 10:00'],"['2002/05/16 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/02 05:00 [medline]', '2002/05/16 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2002 May;87(5):535-41.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the clinical data of 28 patients affected by Hodgkin's disease who relapsed 6 to 24 months from completion of treatment (14 patients) or who were refractory to first-line therapy or relapsed very early (14 patients). All the 28 patients were treated with salvage chemotherapy plus a conditioning regimen followed by peripheral blood stem cell transplant (PBCST) or autologous bone marrow transplant (ABMT). RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 35.5 months (range 14-119), of the 14 patients responding to first-line therapy but who relapsed > 6 months off therapy, 10 (72%) are alive, well and in complete remission (CR), 2 (14%) are alive with disease at 39 and 83 months from transplant, and 2 (14%) died 26 and 63 months after their transplant from acute myeloid leukemia and HD, respectively. At a median follow-up of 39 months, the overall survival (OS) is 68% and the event-free survival (EFS) is 56%. At a median follow-up of 30 months (1-98), of the 14 patients refractory to first-line therapy or who relapsed very early, 9 (64%) are alive in CR, 1 (7%) is alive with disease and 4 (29%) have died of their disease (3 patients) or myelodysplastic syndrome (1 patient). The OS is 58% and the EFS is 52%. There are no statistically significant differences in terms of OS and EFS between the two groups of patients.

DESIGN AND METHODS: Twenty five B-CLL patients (12 males and 13 females; median age 70 years) with disease-related anemia were treated with r-HuEPO. Patients were either on no treatment or on a standard regimen, and had at least Rai stage III disease, with a hematocrit (Hct) <32%. Eleven were newly diagnosed, whereas 14 developed anemia during follow-up. Treatment induction lasted for a maximum of 3 months, during which patients were receiving 150 IU/kg of r-HuEPO s.c. t.i.w. with an escalation to 300 IU/kg t.i.w. if response was slow after one month. Responding patients were placed on maintenance r-HuEPO with 150 IU/kg s.c. once weekly, continuously. Complete response (CR) was defined as an increase of Hct to 38% or more and partial response (PR) as an increase of >6% from pretreatment level. RESULTS: CR was observed in 18/25 (72%) and PR in 2/25 (8%) of the patients. Six patients were downstaged to stage Rai 0, 9 to Rai I and 4 to Rai II. Response was sustained with maintenance therapy. At a median follow-up of 32 months only 4 of the responders required antileukemic treatment. The median survival of responders has not been reached, and 3-year survival is 84%. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: r-HuEPO was efficient in downstaging Rai stage III B-CLL patients, and delayed the initiation of antileukemic therapy. Whether this effect can be translated into better survival rates remains to be clarified in randomized trials.","['Pangalis, Gerassimos A', 'Siakantaris, Marina P', 'Angelopoulou, Maria K', 'Vassilakopoulos, Theodoros P', 'Dimopoulou, Maria N', 'Kyrtsonis, Marie-Christine', 'Konstantopoulos, Konstantinos', 'Tsaftaridis, Panayiotis', 'Vaiopoulos, George A', 'Kontopidou, Flora N']","['Pangalis GA', 'Siakantaris MP', 'Angelopoulou MK', 'Vassilakopoulos TP', 'Dimopoulou MN', 'Kyrtsonis MC', 'Konstantopoulos K', 'Tsaftaridis P', 'Vaiopoulos GA', 'Kontopidou FN']","['National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, School of Medicine, Laikon General Hospital, 16 Sevastoupoleos St., P.O.

Tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha) is important for the growth and survival of B-CLL cells. TNF-alpha promotes the proliferation of the malignant cell clone and is believed to play a role in the progression of B-CLL. The aim of our study was to examine the level of production and intracellular expression of TNF-alpha by T- and B-cells in B-CLL in correlation with stage of disease and clinical parameters. DESIGN AND METHODS: Using a three-color flow cytometry technique we analyzed intracellular TNF-alpha expression by B-cells (CD19+) and by T-cell subsets (CD3+/CD4+ and CD3+/CD8+) in peripheral blood (PB) and bone marrow (BM) from 40 patients with B-CLL and 24 healthy controls. RESULTS: A higher number of TNF-a-positive B-cells were found in PB and BM in B-CLL patients than in normal controls. In BM this difference was statistically significant (p<0.007). Likewise, in PB and BM the percentage of T-cells expressing TNF-alpha was significantly higher in B-CLL patients than in normal controls (PB: p<0.00001; BM: p<0.007). CD3+/CD4+ cells from patients displayed a lower level of intracellular TNF-alpha expression than did CD3+/CD8+ cells (PB: p<0.0001; BM: p<0.04). The number of T-cells expressing TNF-alpha in B-CLL patients was higher in those with stages III-IV than in patients with early stage disease (PB: p<0.007; BM: p<0.01). Additionally, PB and BM T-cell subsets from patients in stages III-IV had a statistically significant higher level of cytoplasmic TNF-a expression than the corresponding cells from healthy controls (PB: p<0.02; BM: p<0.05). In PB the percentage of CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells expressing cytoplasmic TNF-alpha positively correlated with the stage of disease, total tumor mass (TTM) score and lymphocytosis. In BM only the percentage of CD8 T-cells positively correlated with TTM score and lymphocytosis. The expression of TNF-alpha in leukemic B-cells did not correlate with any progression parameters of disease. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: The results obtained suggest that malignant B-cells are exposed to large numbers of T-cells able to synthesize and secrete TNF-alpha. Moreover, T-cells even though fewer than B-cells may be an important source of TNF-a in advanced stages of disease. This indicates that the TNF-alpha can be associated with progression of B-CLL and may be implicated in some side-effects associated with this disease.","['Bojarska-Junak, Agnieszka', 'Rolinski, Jacek', 'Wasik-Szczepaneko, Ewa', 'Kaluzny, Zbigniew', 'Dmoszynska, Anna']","['Bojarska-Junak A', 'Rolinski J', 'Wasik-Szczepaneko E', 'Kaluzny Z', 'Dmoszynska A']","['Department of Clinical Immunology, University School of Medicine, Jaczewskiego 8, 20-950 Lublin, Poland. rolinskij@plusnet.pl']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,['0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)'],IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/*metabolism/pathology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Disease Progression', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/etiology/*metabolism/pathology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism/pathology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*biosynthesis']",2002/05/16 10:00,2003/08/02 05:00,['2002/05/16 10:00'],"['2002/05/16 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/02 05:00 [medline]', '2002/05/16 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2002 May;87(5):490-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity as well as the eligibility to stem cell transplantation (SCT) in a series of 7 patients with relapsing APL, managed with ATO. DESIGN AND METHODS: Seven patients with relapsing APL while on maintenance treatment with all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) or who were ATRA refractory-received ATO at a dose of 10 mg daily by 2-hour intravenous infusion until complete remission (CR). After consolidation chemotherapy, patients were programmed to receive autologous or allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) according to donor availability. The median age of the patients was 55 (21-71) years: 2 patients presented with concomitant extramedullary relapse. RESULTS: Six patients (86%) achieved CR after a median of 35 ATO doses (20-49) with negligible toxicity; one patient died from pneumonia. After consolidation with a four-day course of cytarabine at 1 g/m2 and mitoxantrone 6 mg/m2, two patients underwent allogeneic SCT, two received PML/RARa negative autologous peripheral blood stem cells collected after consolidation plus granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, one failed mobilization and received a second consolidation course. One elderly patient refused further treatment and relapsed 6 months later. After a median follow-up of 15 months from CR2 achievement, 5 patients are alive in continuous CR. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: The high CR rate and the mild toxicity confirm that ATO represents a valid alternative to salvage chemotherapy for patients relapsing while on ATRA treatment or who are ATRA-refractory. Allogeneic or autologous SCT after ATO-induced CR is feasible in the majority of patients.","['Leoni, Franco', 'Gianfaldoni, Giacomo', 'Annunziata, Mario', 'Fanci, Rosa', 'Ciolli, Stefania', 'Nozzoli, Chiara', 'Ferrara, Felicetto']","['Leoni F', 'Gianfaldoni G', 'Annunziata M', 'Fanci R', 'Ciolli S', 'Nozzoli C', 'Ferrara F']","['Divisione di Ematologia, Policlinico di Careggi, viale Morgagni 85, 50134 Florence, Italy. f.leoni@dfc.unifi.it']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage/toxicity', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/mortality/therapy', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oxides/*administration & dosage/toxicity', 'Remission Induction/methods', 'Salvage Therapy', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/methods', 'Survival Rate', 'Therapeutic Equivalency', 'Treatment Outcome']",2002/05/16 10:00,2003/08/02 05:00,['2002/05/16 10:00'],"['2002/05/16 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/02 05:00 [medline]', '2002/05/16 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2002 May;87(5):485-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The association, however, between specific cytogenetic aberrations and mdr1 expression has not yet been examined in a large cohort of patients. DESIGN AND METHODS: We therefore looked for mdr1 gene expression at diagnosis within specific cytogenetic aberrations in 331 previously untreated adult patients with de novo or secondary AML (not including t(15;17)) entered into the German SHG AML96 treatment trial. RESULTS: The proportion of mdr1 positive blast probes was significantly higher in patients with aberrant karyotypes than in those with normal karyotypes (39% vs. 15%; p<0.001). Looking at specific cytogenetic aberrations significantly more mdr1 positive AML patients were found within t(8;21), +8, +21, del(7q), del(5q), -7, abn(3q) and multiple aberrations. In contrast, no patient with inv(16) was positive for mdr1. Only 26% of mdr1 positive patients with aberrant karyotypes achieved complete remission (CR) whereas 54% of the mdr1 negative counterparts did so (p=0.002). Furthermore, within abn(11q), +21, +22, -5 or abn(3q) no mdr1 positive patient reached CR, whereas the mdr1 negative counterparts had CR rates comparable to the CR rate of patients with a normal karyotype. This was most impressive in mdr1 negative patients with multiple aberrations achieving a CR rate of 63% (p=0.019). In the multivariate analysis age, disease status and mdr1 expression were the strongest independent predictors for induction treatment failure. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: The correlation described here between mdr1 gene expression and some cytogenetic aberrations might explain the prognostic divergence of such cytogenetic aberrations in different AML treatment trials due to the amount of mdr-drugs used within the protocols.","['Schaich, Markus', 'Harbich-Brutscher, Edith', 'Pascheberg, Ulrich', 'Mohr, Brigitte', 'Soucek, Silke', 'Ehninger, Gerhard', 'Illmer, Thomas']","['Schaich M', 'Harbich-Brutscher E', 'Pascheberg U', 'Mohr B', 'Soucek S', 'Ehninger G', 'Illmer T']","['Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik I, Universitatsklinikum C.G.

To determine if viral titer influenced the transduction efficiency of FLS, we optimized a rapid, efficient, and inexpensive centrifugation method to concentrate recombinant retroviral supernatant. The technique was evaluated by measurement of the expression of a viral enhanced green fluorescent protein transgene in transduced cells, and by analysis of viral RNA in retroviral supernatant. Concentration (100-fold) was achieved by centrifugation of viral supernatant for four hours, with 100% recovery of viral particles. The transduction of FLS increased from approximately 15% with unconcentrated supernatant, to nearly 50% using concentrated supernatant.

IL-6 signaling is mediated exclusively by the common signal-transducing component gp130, which is also essential for signal transduction of other cytokines of the leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF)/IL-6 family. M Ernst and colleagues generated and studied knock-in mice (gp130DeltaSTAT/DeltaSTAT), in which all STAT-binding sites (sites binding signal transducers and activators of transcription) were deleted from their gene encoding gp130 but binding sites for both Janus kinases (JAKs) and for the protein tyrosine phosphatase-2 (SHP-2) were preserved. They found that this mutant mouse displayed a blastocyst implantation defect, gastrointestinal ulceration, and, interestingly, severe joint disease with representative features of rheumatoid arthritis. Synovial cells from this mouse exhibited mitogenic hyper-responsiveness to cytokines of the LIF/IL-6 family, a phenomenon that was caused by sustained gp130-mediated SHP-2/Ras/Erk activation due to a defect in the induction of SOCS-1 (suppressor of cytokine signaling-1; also known as SSI or JAB). This suppressor, induced by STAT signaling, regulates cytokine signaling. It is, therefore, conceivable that the disturbance of the balanced activation between the STAT and SHP-2/Ras/Erk signal pathways causes the joint disease in the gp130DeltaSTAT/DeltaSTAT mouse. These findings may be beneficial in the elucidation of the cause and the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in humans.","['Naka, Tetsuji', 'Kishimoto, Tadamitsu']","['Naka T', 'Kishimoto T']","['Department of Molecular Medicine, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Japan. naka@imed3.med.osaka-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Arthritis Res,Arthritis research,100913255,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Il6st protein, mouse)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Socs1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 1 Protein)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD/genetics/*metabolism', 'Arthritis, Rheumatoid/genetics/*metabolism', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Down-Regulation', 'Interleukin-6/*metabolism', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Mutant Strains', 'Mice, Transgenic', '*Repressor Proteins', 'Signal Transduction', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 1 Protein', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins']",2002/05/16 10:00,2002/09/27 06:00,['2002/05/16 10:00'],"['2001/10/01 00:00 [received]', '2001/11/22 00:00 [revised]', '2001/11/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/05/16 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/27 06:00 [medline]', '2002/05/16 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1186/ar400 [doi]'],ppublish,Arthritis Res. 2002;4(3):154-6. doi: 10.1186/ar400.

Induction of AKT serine/threonine kinase activity is augmented by the T-cell leukemia-1 (TCL1) oncoprotein through a physical association requiring the AKT pleckstrin homology domain. Here, we used molecular modeling and identified an exposed hydrophobic patch composed of two discontinuous amino acid stretches near one end of the TCL1 beta-barrel that was required for a TCL1-AKT association. Site-directed mutations of this region did not affect TCL1 secondary structure, yet they disrupted interactions with AKT. This region was found in other members of the TCL1 oncoprotein family, such as TCL1b and MTCP1, and suggested a conserved, novel AKT binding domain. Interestingly, TCL1 and AKT co-localize in multiple cell compartments, but only extracts from the plasma membrane stimulate optimal complex formation in vitro.

We have additionally analyzed whether membrane fusion between HIV-like particles can be mediated by amphotropic murine leukemia virus (MuLV) glycoprotein and its respective cellular receptor, PiT-2. We demonstrate that PiT-2 can be incorporated into HIV-like particles and can fuse with MuLV-Env-carrying particles.

Histamine oxidase with a histidine tag was readily purified using a histidine affinity column. The enzyme showed higher catalytic activity on histamine than diamines (e.g., putrescine and cadaverine) or N(tau)-methylhistamine. The sensor had three carbon film electrodes modified with osmium-polyvinylpyridine-based gel containing horseradish peroxidase, histamine oxidase, and Ag. When a standard solution of histamine was aspirated at a flow rate of 2 microl/min, the detected current was proportional to the histamine concentration and the lower detection limit was 11.3 nM. When rat basophilic leukemia cells (1 x 10(6)) were stimulated by various concentrations of antigen (2, 20, and 200 ng/ml), the histamine concentrations were 0.32, 2.7, and 1.3 microM, respectively, and 20 ng/ml of antigen was found to be the optimal concentration for the antigen-antibody reaction. In contrast, when thapsigargin, an inhibitor of Ca-ATPase in the endoplasmic reticulum, was added (50, 100, and 500 nM), the detected current increased with thapsigargin concentrations and the measured histamine concentrations were 28 nM, 1.3 microM, and 2.7 microM, respectively. These results indicate that the microsensor is useful for the analysis of histamine release from mast cells.","['Iwaki, Shoko', 'Ogasawara, Masahito', 'Kurita, Ryoji', 'Niwa, Osamu', 'Tanizawa, Katsuyuki', 'Ohashi, Yuichi', 'Maeyama, Kazutaka']","['Iwaki S', 'Ogasawara M', 'Kurita R', 'Niwa O', 'Tanizawa K', 'Ohashi Y', 'Maeyama K']","['Department of Pharmacology, Ehime University School of Medicine, Ehime 791-0295, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Anal Biochem,Analytical biochemistry,0370535,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '67526-95-8 (Thapsigargin)', '820484N8I3 (Histamine)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'EC 1.4.3.21 (Amine Oxidase (Copper-Containing))', 'EC 7.2.2.10 (Calcium-Transporting ATPases)']",IM,"['Amine Oxidase (Copper-Containing)/chemistry/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Biosensing Techniques/instrumentation/*methods', 'Calcium-Transporting ATPases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Catalysis', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Histamine/*analysis/metabolism', 'Histamine Release/*physiology', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/chemistry', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/physiopathology', 'Monitoring, Physiologic/instrumentation/methods', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Rats', 'Recombinant Proteins/chemistry/isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Thapsigargin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/05/16 10:00,2002/10/11 04:00,['2002/05/16 10:00'],"['2002/05/16 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/10/11 04:00 [medline]', '2002/05/16 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1006/abio.2002.5598 [doi]', 'S0003269702955983 [pii]']",ppublish,Anal Biochem. 2002 May 15;304(2):236-43. doi: 10.1006/abio.2002.5598.,,,,,,,,,['(c) 2002 Elsevier Science (USA)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To understand what makes this normal molecule antigenic, we compared its expression in malignant versus normal cells. Immunohistology showed overexpression of cyclin B1 protein in tumors compared to surrounding normal tissue and localization in the cytoplasm rather than the nucleus. Cyclin B1 is overexpressed at protein and mRNA level in many tumor cell lines including breast, lung, colorectal carcinoma, lymphoma and leukemia. While overexpressed in tumor cells at all stages of the cell cycle, its expression still peaks at G(2)/M phase, as it does in normal cells. We compared cyclin B1 expression in two cell clones derived from the same colorectal tumor cell line, one wild type for p53 (HCT116p53(+/+)) and one with deleted p53 (HCT116p53(-/-)). HCT116p53(+/+) cells had undetectable (normal) level of cyclin B1 protein, while HCT116p53(-/-) cells showed overexpression. When reconstituted with p53, HCT116p53(-/-) cells reverted to normal cyclin B1 expression. We conclude that p53 plays an important role in cyclin B1 regulation and that tumors with mutated p53 will be good candidates for cyclin B1 based immunotherapy.","['Yu, Min', 'Zhan, Qimin', 'Finn, Olivera J']","['Yu M', 'Zhan Q', 'Finn OJ']","['Department of Immunology, W1142 Biomedical Science Tower, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, PA 15261, USA.']",['eng'],"['5P01 CA73743/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50CA90440/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Mol Immunol,Molecular immunology,7905289,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (CCNB1 protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin B)', '0 (Cyclin B1)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",IM,"['Antigens, Neoplasm/*biosynthesis/genetics/immunology', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cyclin B/*biosynthesis/genetics/*immunology', 'Cyclin B1', 'Gene Deletion', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/genetics/immunology/*metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/*physiology']",2002/05/16 10:00,2002/06/12 10:01,['2002/05/16 10:00'],"['2002/05/16 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/06/12 10:01 [medline]', '2002/05/16 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0161589002000263 [pii]', '10.1016/s0161-5890(02)00026-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Immunol. 2002 May;38(12-13):981-7. doi: 10.1016/s0161-5890(02)00026-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Candidemia in a tertiary referral hospital in the Middle East confirms the current epidemiologic shift in this common blood stream pathogen towards non-malignancy cases (38%) and antifungal prophylaxis failure (20%), high presentation sepsis scores and attributable mortality (32%). Invasive aspergillosis (IA) is also associated with high mortality. Use of non-invasive computerized tomographic (CT) radiologic scanning linked to early administration of high dose liposomal amphotericin B (LAB) is associated with a reduced mortality of 9.5% compared to historical experience of 28%.Life threatening invasive aspergillosis also occurs in patients who are less obviously immunocompromized. Investigations may reveal subtle immune deficits which could place the patient at some risk for an invasive mycosis. Antifungal treatment used in combination with progenitor cell growth factors and gamma-interferon has proved successful in such situations of progressive fungal disease unresponsive to antifungal therapy alone. Pharmacologic remodeling of existing compounds by lipidisation reduces both the toxicity denominator and the efficacy numerator of the therapeutic index when compared to the parent drug. A comparative dose study of liposomal amphotericin B in aspergillosis has demonstrated equi-efficacy, generated debate over the ability of the controlled clinical trial to be capable of assessing antifungal efficacy, and illustrated that recovery from an invasive fungal infection may require maximum tolerated doses and immunomanipulation. Several new antifungal strategies are under clinical investigation. These include reformulating existing antifungals, exploitation of the growing knowledge of virulence factors to synthesize antagonists, immune reconstitution and immunoprotection. An interim analysis of an ongoing placebo controlled study of recombinant interleukin-11 to assess its efficacy in reducing sepsis in leukemia patients through prevention of chemotherapy induced gut epithelial cell apoptosis, has demonstrated a difference in the two study arms in sepsis rates and preservation of gastrointestinal epithelial cell integrity. The unique and special challenges presented by the dynamic epidemiologics of invasive fungal infections are demanding and attracting considerable responses, in the fields of diagnosis and therapeutics. Current strategies need considerable improvement, yet ongoing collaborative efforts will have a positive impact on our understanding of the fungus-host interaction and ultimately our ability to offer better care for our patients with invasive mycoses.","['Ellis, Michael']",['Ellis M'],"['Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences and Tawam Hospital, Al Ain, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. ellis@emirates.net.ae']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Mol Immunol,Molecular immunology,7905289,['0 (Antifungal Agents)'],IM,"['Antifungal Agents/therapeutic use', 'Aspergillosis/diagnosis/epidemiology/therapy', 'Candidiasis/diagnosis/epidemiology/mortality/therapy', 'Humans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mycoses/*diagnosis/epidemiology/mortality/*therapy', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed', 'United Arab Emirates/epidemiology']",2002/05/16 10:00,2002/06/12 10:01,['2002/05/16 10:00'],"['2002/05/16 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/06/12 10:01 [medline]', '2002/05/16 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0161589002000226 [pii]', '10.1016/s0161-5890(02)00022-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Immunol. 2002 May;38(12-13):947-57. doi: 10.1016/s0161-5890(02)00022-6.,,,,,,,50,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: One of two patients with mild impairment of renal function and an active urinary sediment had ultrastructural features of idiopathic type I membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN), and the other had features of fibrillary/ immunotactoid glomerulonephritis with deposits of IgG and C3. One patient with nephrotic syndrome had characteristic electron microscopic appearances of type III MPGN. In all three there was an association with monoclonal gammopathy. The parameters of glomerular damage improved in association with response to drug treatment of the CLL.

The expression of CD56 was correlated with clinical characteristics at diagnosis, response to therapy, survival and disease-free survival. Blast expression of CD56 (> or = 20% of leukemic blasts) was seen in 16 (8%) of patients, with a median expression of 67% (range 20-99%).

This study investigated the mechanism of IA binding to DNA for a series of 13 analogs that differ in their cytotoxic potency. Using C-1311 as a model compound, crystallographic, spectroscopic and biochemical techniques were employed to characterize drug-DNA interactions. X-ray crystallographic analysis revealed a planar structure of imidazoacridinone core that is capable of intercalative DNA binding. Accordingly, C-1311 binding to DNA followed 'classical' pattern observed for intercalation, as proved by the DNA topoisomerase I-unwinding experiments, with relatively weak binding affinity (K(i)=1.2 x 10(5)M(-1)), and the binding site size of 2.4 bp. Other IA also bound to DNA with the binding affinity in the range of 10(5)M(-1) and binding site size of 2-3 bp, suggesting a prevalence of the intercalative mechanism, similar to C-1311. Considerable DNA binding affinity was displayed by all the highly cytotoxic derivatives. However, none of the analyzed drug-DNA binding parameters was significantly correlated with IA biological activities such as cell growth, DNA and RNA synthesis inhibition, or tumor growth inhibition, which suggests that the IA ability to non-covalently bind to DNA is not crucial for their biological activity. These results show that the ability to intercalate into DNA is a prominent attribute of IA, although factors other than intercalative binding seem to be required for the biological activities of IA drugs.","['Dziegielewski, Jaroslaw', 'Slusarski, Bartlomiej', 'Konitz, Antoni', 'Skladanowski, Andrzej', 'Konopa, Jerzy']","['Dziegielewski J', 'Slusarski B', 'Konitz A', 'Skladanowski A', 'Konopa J']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Technology and Biochemistry, Technical University of Gdansk, Narutowicza 11/12, 80-952, Gdansk, Poland.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Aminoacridines)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Intercalating Agents)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', 'MZ4Y5H4OAB (C 1311)']",IM,"['Aminoacridines/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Crystallization', 'Crystallography, X-Ray', 'DNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis/chemistry/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Intercalating Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia L1210', 'Mice', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Nucleic Acid Conformation', 'RNA/biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence', 'Spectrophotometry, Atomic', 'Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet']",2002/05/15 10:00,2002/07/12 10:01,['2002/05/15 10:00'],"['2002/05/15 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/07/12 10:01 [medline]', '2002/05/15 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0006295202009164 [pii]', '10.1016/s0006-2952(02)00916-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2002 May 1;63(9):1653-62. doi: 10.1016/s0006-2952(02)00916-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have demonstrated previously that increased chlorambucil (CLB)-induced HsRad51 nuclear foci formation correlated with a CLB-resistant phenotype in B-CLL lymphocytes. In this report, we measured the protein levels of HsRad51 and Xrcc3 (an HsRad51 paralog) and correlated them with the in vitro CLB cytotoxicity (LD(50)) in lymphocytes from seventeen B-CLL patients. Both HsRad51 (r=0.75, P=0.0005) and Xrcc3 (r=0.52, P=0.03) protein levels correlated with the in vitro CLB LD(50). In addition, multiple linear regression analysis showed a significant correlation between Xrcc3 and Rad51 protein levels versus the CLB LD(50) (r=0.78, P=0.0014), suggesting that both proteins influence CLB cytotoxicity. Moreover, since HsRad51 expression varies in cell lines during the cell cycle, we determined proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) protein levels to assess possible differences in cell cycle progression. There was no correlation between PCNA protein levels and the CLB LD(50) (r=0.042, P=0.87) or with HsRad51/Xrcc3 protein levels.

HTLV-1 transformed cell lines originally derived by cocultivation of uninfected peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) with lethally irradiated leukemic cells from patient samples (SLB-1, MT-2 and HT-1-RV) were lymphomagenic when inoculated into NOD/SCID mice. In contrast, immortalized cell lines generated by transfection PBMC with an infectious molecular clone of HTLV-1 (ACH or ACH.p12) were not tumorigenic. The differing behaviors of HTLV-1 infected cell lines in NOD/SCID mice indicates that viral infection and immortalization of human PBMC for growth in culture is not sufficient for induction of a tumorigenic phenotype.

A high level of expression has been reported in blasts from patients with various hematological malignancies. The study was performed to evaluate the utility of monitoring WT1 expression in children with leukemia at diagnosis, during therapy, and following bone marrow transplant. We tested a total of 204 samples prospectively. These included samples from patients with the following diagnoses: acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) at diagnosis (n = 45), at relapse (n = 14), and in remission (n = 45); acute non-lymphoblastic leukemia (ANLL) at diagnosis (n = 14), at relapse (n = 5), and in remission (n = 12); and chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) in blast crisis (n = 1) and in chronic phase (n = 1). A total of 33 of these patients were transplanted: 19 ALL, 12 ANLL, and 2 CML. In addition, samples from 5 patients with aplastic anemia and 28 controls were obtained from peripheral blood (n = 17), cord blood (n = 3), and bone marrow (n = 8). Primer pairs were designed to locate specific nucleotide sequences for mRNA of WT1. RT-PCR was performed in all samples and compared with K562 cells from ATCC (defined as 1.0) as positive control. A positive test was arbitrarily defined as WT1/K562 > 0.5. Samples at diagnosis and relapse, including 56 out of 59 ALL (95%), 26 ANLL (100%), and 1 CML in blast crisis, demonstrated high levels of WT1 expression. In contrast, only 5 of 90 samples obtained in remission or post-transplant showed high levels of WT1 expression ( P < 0.0001; 95% CI = 0.66-0.94). The five patients with high WT1 expression during follow-up relapsed within 2 to 6 months. In conclusion, we have found that WT1 is consistently elevated in children with leukemia. Significant differences in the level of WT1 expression were noted between these patients during diagnosis and at relapse, and those during remission. More importantly, following bone marrow transplant, a significant high level of WT1 expression preceded clinical relapse by 2 to 6 months. Therefore, WT1 is a reliable marker for monitoring minimal residual disease during therapy as well as in the post-transplant period.","['Kletzel, Morris', 'Olzewski, Marie', 'Huang, Wei', 'Chou, Pauline M']","['Kletzel M', 'Olzewski M', 'Huang W', 'Chou PM']","[""Department of Pediatrics, The Stem Cell Transplant Program, Children's Memorial Hospital, Northwestern University Medical School, Box 30, 2300 Children's Plaza, Chicago, IL 60614, USA.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Pediatr Dev Pathol,Pediatric and developmental pathology : the official journal of the Society for Pediatric Pathology and the Paediatric Pathology Society,9809673,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/*diagnosis/therapy', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/chemistry/pathology', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*diagnosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'RNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*WT1 Proteins/genetics']",2002/05/15 10:00,2002/08/14 10:01,['2002/05/15 10:00'],"['2002/05/15 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/14 10:01 [medline]', '2002/05/15 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s10024-001-0208-x [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Dev Pathol. 2002 May-Jun;5(3):269-75. doi: 10.1007/s10024-001-0208-x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have applied an analytical high-performance liquid chromatography method for the quantitative detection of LFM-A13 in plasma samples. Our findings indicate that LFM-A13 is quickly absorbed, with the time required to reach the maximum plasma drug concentration (t(max)) being 10-18 min after i.p. administration with nearly complete bioavailability. LFM-A13 had an elimination half-life of 17-32 min after i.p. administration at dose levels of 10-50 mg/kg. LFM-A13 exhibited a dose-dependent and significant increase in the values of normalized area under the curve and maximum concentration (C(max)) as well as a dose-dependent and significant decrease in clearance values, suggesting a saturable clearance mechanism. LFM-A13 was not toxic to mice when administered systemically at dose levels ranging from 10 to 80 mg/kg. Highly effective BTK-inhibitory and apoptosis-promoting plasma concentrations of LFM-A13 could be achieved in mice without toxicity. LFM-A13 exhibited a favorable pharmacokinetic behavior that was not adversely affected by the standard chemotherapy drugs vincristine, methylprednisolone, or L-asparaginase (when used as combination treatment, VPL) and significantly improved the chemotherapy response and survival outcome of mice challenged with BCL-1 leukemia cells. Whereas only 14% of mice treated with the standard triple-drug combination VPL became long-term survivors, 41% of mice treated with this combination plus LFM-A13 survived long-term. LFM-A13 prolonged the median survival time of VPL-treated mice from 37 to 58 days. Our results confirm and extend previous studies regarding the role of BTK chemotherapy resistance of B-lineage leukemic cells (S. Mahajan et al., J. Biol. Chem., 274: 9587-9599, 1999). BTK inhibitors such as LFM-A13 may be useful as a new class of chemosensitizing and apoptosis-promoting antileukemic agents for treatment of patients with chemotherapy-resistant B-lineage leukemias or lymphomas.","['Uckun, Fatih M', 'Zheng, Yaguo', 'Cetkovic-Cvrlje, Marina', 'Vassilev, Alexei', 'Lisowski, Elizabeth', 'Waurzyniak, Barbara', 'Chen, Hao', 'Carpenter, Randy', 'Chen, Chun-Lin']","['Uckun FM', 'Zheng Y', 'Cetkovic-Cvrlje M', 'Vassilev A', 'Lisowski E', 'Waurzyniak B', 'Chen H', 'Carpenter R', 'Chen CL']","['Parker Hughes Cancer Center, Parker Hughes Institute, St. Paul, Minnesota 55113, USA.

We tested the safety and efficacy of a diphtheria fusion protein [diphtheria toxin (DT)388 granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GMCSF)] directed against the GMCSF receptor that is strongly expressed by leukemic blasts. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: DT388GMCSF fusion protein containing the catalytic and translocation domains of DT388 fused to human GMCSF was administered in an interpatient dose escalation trial by 15 min i.v. infusion daily for up to 5 days. RESULTS: The maximal tolerated dose was 4 microg/kg/day. The dose-limiting toxicity was liver injury and occurred at the 4.5-5-microg/kg/day dose level. Among nine treated patients at these doses, one patient developed liver failure, and one patient had transient hepatic encephalopathy. There was a positive correlation between peak serum DT388GMCSF levels and serum aspartate aminotransferase (P = 0.0002). DT388GMCSF did not damage hepatic cell lines in vitro; however, DT388GMCSF binds macrophages and induces cytokine release in vitro. Among the treated patients, we observed an early elevation in serum levels of interleukin (IL)-18 and a later rise in IL-8 but no significant changes in IL-1beta, IL-6, IFNgamma, macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha, tumor necrosis factor alpha or IL-12. The IL-18 elevations occurred before elevations of liver enzymes and correlated with peak aspartate aminotransferase levels (P = 0.005). Of the 31 patients who were resistant to chemotherapy, 1 had a complete remission and 2 had partial remissions; all 3 of these patients were treated at or above the maximal tolerated dose, all 3 responding patients had baseline marrow blast percentage of <30%, whereas only 6 of the nonresponding 28 patients had less than 30% marrow blasts. Five of these six patients were treated with subtherapeutic doses. Eight (42%) of 19 patient courses at <4 microg/kg/day and 8 (40%) of 20 patient courses at 4-5 microg/kg/day showed marrow blast reductions at day 12. Patients with higher pretreatment anti-DT388GMCSF levels had significantly lower peak DT388GMCSF levels (P = 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: DT388GMCSF can produce complete and partial remissions in patients with chemotherapy-resistant acute myeloid leukemia, but methods to prevent liver injury are needed before more widespread application of this novel agent.","['Frankel, Arthur E', 'Powell, Bayard L', 'Hall, Philip D', 'Case, L Douglas', 'Kreitman, Robert J']","['Frankel AE', 'Powell BL', 'Hall PD', 'Case LD', 'Kreitman RJ']","['Wake Forest University Baptist Medical Center, Winston-Salem, North Carolina 27157, USA. afrankel@wfubmc.edu']",['eng'],"['1R01CA76178/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1R21CA90550/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'M01RR07122/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']","['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Diphtheria Toxin)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.6.1.1 (Aspartate Aminotransferases)', 'EC 2.6.1.2 (Alanine Transaminase)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Alanine Transaminase/blood/drug effects', 'Aspartate Aminotransferases/blood/drug effects', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology/drug effects', 'Child', 'Cytokines/blood/drug effects', 'Diphtheria Toxin/adverse effects/genetics/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/adverse effects/genetics/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Hypocalcemia/chemically induced', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/blood/*drug therapy', 'Liver Failure/chemically induced', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', 'Partial Thromboplastin Time', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Renal Insufficiency/chemically induced', 'Thymidine/metabolism', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism']",2002/05/15 10:00,2002/10/18 04:00,['2002/05/15 10:00'],"['2002/05/15 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/10/18 04:00 [medline]', '2002/05/15 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2002 May;8(5):1004-13.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of this study was to examine p53 mutations in leukemias after ovarian cancer, for which treatment with platinum analogues was widely used. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Adequate leukemic or dysplastic cells were available in 17 of 82 cases of leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome that occurred in a multicenter, population-based cohort of 23,170 women with ovarian cancer. Eleven of the 17 received platinum compounds and other alkylating agents with or without DNA topoisomerase II inhibitors and/or radiation. Six received other alkylating agents, in one case, with radiation. Genomic DNA was extracted and p53 exons 5, 6, 7, and 8 were amplified by PCR. Mutations and loss of heterozygosity were analyzed on the WAVE instrument (Transgenomic) followed by selected analysis by sequencing. RESULTS: Eleven p53 mutations involving all four exons studied and one polymorphism were identified. Genomic DNA analyses were consistent with loss of heterozygosity for four of the mutations. The 11 mutations occurred in 9 cases, such that 6 of 11 leukemias after platinum-based regimens (55%) and 3 of 6 leukemias after other treatments (50%) contained p53 mutations. Two leukemias that occurred after treatment with platinum analogues contained two mutations. Among eight mutations in leukemias after treatment with platinum analogues, there were four G-to-A transitions and one G-to-C transversion. CONCLUSIONS: p53 mutations are common in leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome after multiagent therapy for ovarian cancer. The propensity for G-to-A transitions may reflect specific DNA damage in leukemias after treatment with platinum analogues.","['Leonard, Debra G B', 'Travis, Lois B', 'Addya, Kathakali', 'Dores, Graca M', 'Holowaty, Eric J', 'Bergfeldt, Kjell', 'Malkin, David', 'Kohler, Betsy A', 'Lynch, Charles F', 'Wiklund, Tom', 'Stovall, Marilyn', 'Hall, Per', 'Pukkala, Eero', 'Slater, Diana J', 'Felix, Carolyn A']","['Leonard DG', 'Travis LB', 'Addya K', 'Dores GM', 'Holowaty EJ', 'Bergfeldt K', 'Malkin D', 'Kohler BA', 'Lynch CF', 'Wiklund T', 'Stovall M', 'Hall P', 'Pukkala E', 'Slater DJ', 'Felix CA']","['Department of Pathology, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia 19104, USA.']",['eng'],"['CA77683/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA80175/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA85469/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-CP-50134/CP/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Base Sequence', 'Cisplatin/administration & dosage', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'DNA, Neoplasm/chemistry/genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/complications/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/complications/*genetics', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/complications/*drug therapy/radiotherapy', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*genetics']",2002/05/15 10:00,2002/10/18 04:00,['2002/05/15 10:00'],"['2002/05/15 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/10/18 04:00 [medline]', '2002/05/15 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2002 May;8(5):973-85.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['Clin Cancer Res. 2002 Aug;8(8):2752-3'],,,,,,,,

Imatinib, an orally administered inhibitor of the breakpoint cluster region-Abl tyrosine kinase, is capable of blocking proliferation and inducing apoptosis in CML cell lines. In this report, we describe the preclinical profile of imatinib and the data submitted in the New Drug Application that led to its marketing approval. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Chemistry manufacturing and controls, animal toxicology, and biopharmaceutical data are described. Results of Phase I and Phase II clinical studies in patients with CML in blast crisis (CML-BC), in accelerated phase (CML-AP), and in chronic phase disease-resistant or intolerant to IFN-alpha (CML-CP) are summarized. The basis for marketing approval and postmarketing commitments by the pharmaceutical company are discussed. RESULTS: Toxicology studies in the rat, dog, and monkey show the hematological, renal, and hepatobiliary toxicity of imatinib. Pharmacokinetic studies in patients with CML demonstrate 98% imatinib bioavailability. The elimination half-lives of the parent drug and the major active metabolite, CGP74588, from plasma are approximately 18 and 40 h, respectively. Approximately 81% of the drug is eliminated in 7 days, 68% in the feces and 13% in the urine. Cytochrome P-450 3A4 is the main enzyme responsible for imatinib metabolism. Phase I and II clinical studies were conducted. The Phase I study, in 83 CML patients, evaluated oral imatinib doses from 25 to 1000 mg/day. Dose-limiting toxicity was not observed. The three Phase II studies, in CML-CP, CML-AP, and CML-BC, enrolled 1027 patients. CML-CP patients received 400 mg/day imatinib, whereas CML-AP and CML-BC patients generally received 600 mg/day imatinib. Primary study endpoints were cytogenetic response rate (CML-CP) and hematological response rate (CML-AP and CML-BC). The cytogenetic response rate for CML-CP patients was 49%. The hematological response rate of CML-AP and CML-BC patients was 63 and 26%, respectively. The most common imatinib adverse events were nausea, vomiting, myalgia, edema, and diarrhea. Elevated liver enzymes and/or bilirubin were reported in 27 patients (2.6%). CONCLUSIONS: On May 10, 2001, imatinib mesylate (Gleevec, formerly known as STI-571 and Glivec), manufactured and distributed by Novartis Pharmaceuticals, East Hanover, NJ, was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of CML in three clinical settings: CML-BC, CML-AP, and CML-CP.

Sir2 is a conserved protein and was recently shown to regulate lifespan extension both in budding yeast and worms. Here, we show that SIRT1, the human Sir2 homolog, is recruited to the promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) nuclear bodies of mammalian cells upon overexpression of either PML or oncogenic Ras (Ha-rasV12). SIRT1 binds and deacetylates p53, a component of PML nuclear bodies, and it can repress p53-mediated transactivation. Moreover, we show that SIRT1 and p53 co-localize in nuclear bodies upon PML upregulation. When overexpressed in primary mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs), SIRT1 antagonizes PML-induced acetylation of p53 and rescues PML-mediated premature cellular senescence. Taken together, our data establish the SIRT1 deacetylase as a novel negative regulator of p53 function capable of modulating cellular senescence.","['Langley, Emma', 'Pearson, Mark', 'Faretta, Mario', 'Bauer, Uta-Maria', 'Frye, Roy A', 'Minucci, Saverio', 'Pelicci, Pier Giuseppe', 'Kouzarides, Tony']","['Langley E', 'Pearson M', 'Faretta M', 'Bauer UM', 'Frye RA', 'Minucci S', 'Pelicci PG', 'Kouzarides T']","['Wellcome Institute/Cancer Research UK and Department of Pathology, University of Cambridge, Tennis Court Road, CB2 1QR, UK.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Pml protein, mouse)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Silent Information Regulator Proteins, Saccharomyces cerevisiae)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.1.- (SIR2 protein, S cerevisiae)', 'EC 3.5.1.- (SIRT1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.1.- (Sirtuin 1)', 'EC 3.5.1.- (Sirtuin 2)', 'EC 3.5.1.- (Sirtuins)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cellular Senescence/*physiology', 'Fibroblasts/cytology/physiology', 'HeLa Cells', 'Histone Deacetylases/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', '*Silent Information Regulator Proteins, Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Sirtuin 1', 'Sirtuin 2', 'Sirtuins', 'Testis/cytology/enzymology', 'Trans-Activators/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation/physiology', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",2002/05/15 10:00,2002/07/13 10:01,['2002/05/15 10:00'],"['2002/05/15 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/07/13 10:01 [medline]', '2002/05/15 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/emboj/21.10.2383 [doi]'],ppublish,EMBO J. 2002 May 15;21(10):2383-96. doi: 10.1093/emboj/21.10.2383.,,,PMC126010,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A possible way to enhance immunogenicity of pre-B ALL cells is to convert them to DC-like cells. METHODS: To study the effect of ALL cells on T-cell function, ALL cells were incubated with T adult cells activated by OKT3 MAb. Liquid culture of de novo pre-B ALL cells for 7 days, in a medium containing IL-1alpha, IL-3, IL-7, Flt 3 ligand (L) and tumor-necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) produced DC-like cells. These were evaluated for morphology, viability, phenotype, as measured by flow cytometry, and function, including MLR. RESULTS: Pre-B ALL cell-lines NALM-6, BALM and de novo pre-B ALL cells failed to stimulate T cells, but suppressed stimulated T cells. The DC-like cells displayed characteristic features of DCs: filiform cytoplasmic projections, and phenotypic expression of co-stimulatory molecules CD80/86, MHC Class I and II molecules, CD83 and CD1a. Genetic monoclonality study confirmed their leukemic origin. In a 5-day MLR culture, the DC-like cells potently activated allogeneic adult and cord CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Furthermore, both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were primed towards a Type I. No such effect was seen with unmanipulated de novo pre-B ALL cells. DISCUSSION: DC-like cells can be generated from childhood pre-B ALL cells and are potent stimulators of adult and naive cord CD8+ T cells via CD4+ cells. These cells may form part of an immunotherapy strategy to overcome tolerance to ALL cells.","['Han, P', 'Story, C', 'McDonald, T', 'Mrozik, K', 'Snell, L']","['Han P', 'Story C', 'McDonald T', 'Mrozik K', 'Snell L']","[""Department of Haematology, Women's and Children's Hospital, Flinders Medical Centre, Australia.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cytotherapy,Cytotherapy,100895309,,IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Cell Cycle/immunology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Dendritic Cells/cytology/*immunology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/*methods', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*immunology/therapy', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",2002/05/15 10:00,2002/11/26 04:00,['2002/05/15 10:00'],"['2002/05/15 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/11/26 04:00 [medline]', '2002/05/15 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1080/146532402317381875 [doi]', 'S1465-3249(02)71051-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Cytotherapy. 2002;4(2):165-75. doi: 10.1080/146532402317381875.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To reduce the risks of T-cell depletion, it seems feasible to collect autologous CD4+ cells at an early disease stage and subsequently reinfuse them during periods of profound T-cell depletion. METHOD: We describe a two-step cell-selection method to obtain highly enriched CD4+ T-cells from leukapheresis compounds of patients with CD23+ B-CLL. The double selection procedure was performed using the CellPro Ceperate device, and consisted of CD4+ selection followed by CD23 purging to further remove contaminating CD23+ B-cells from the CD4+ cell fraction. The results of eight runs performed with leukapheresis material obtained from eight patients with CD23+ B-CLL at different disease stages are presented. RESULTS: The CD4/CD23 double cell-selection procedure resulted in the purification of > 90% CD4+ cells. Median recovery of CD4+ T lymphocytes after selection was 46%, and was negatively affected by the initial tumor cell load. The final T-cell fraction still contained lymphocytes of the B-CLL clone, as determined by FACS and PCR. The cell-processing procedure had no impact on T-cell function, as assessed by the in vitro production of the cytokine interferon-gamma. Moreover, the selected CD4+ cells retained their capacity to co-stimulate mitogen-induced B-cell IgG production in vitro.

Even though patients with chemotherapy-induced leukopenia are at high risk of infection and mortality, only limited information is available on serum cholesterol levels in these patients. We therefore measured serum cholesterol levels in 17 patients with hematological malignancies during chemotherapy-induced neutropenia and correlated it with clinical outcome. Patients with fever (>38.5 degrees C) showed a significant decrease in serum cholesterol levels within 24 hours. Eight days after onset of the fever non-survivors had significantly lower serum cholesterol levels (median 2.09 mmol/l, range 0.49-2.79, n=6) compared to survivors (median 3.23 mmol/l, range 1.68-4.86, n=11). Cholesterol levels in survivors returned to baseline levels at the time of discharge from the hospital. At the onset of fever, serum levels of inflammatory cytokines interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and soluble TNF receptors p55 and p75 were elevated in all patients, but only TNF and TNF receptor p75 levels were significantly different in survivors and non-survivors. Our data suggest that a decrease in serum cholesterol levels is a prognostic marker in neutropenic patients with fever. Release of inflammatory cytokines may in part be responsible for hypocholesterolemia in these patients.","['Fraunberger, Peter', 'Hahn, Joachim', 'Holler, Ernst', 'Walli, Autar K', 'Seidel, Dietrich']","['Fraunberger P', 'Hahn J', 'Holler E', 'Walli AK', 'Seidel D']","['Department of Clinical Chemistry, University Hospital Grosshadern, Munich, Germany. peter.fraunberger@klch.med.uni-muenchen.de']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Germany,Clin Chem Lab Med,Clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine,9806306,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Type I)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Type II)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '9007-41-4 (C-Reactive Protein)', '97C5T2UQ7J (Cholesterol)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/blood', 'Blood Chemical Analysis/*methods', 'Body Temperature', 'C-Reactive Protein/metabolism', 'Cholesterol/*blood', 'Cytokines/blood', 'Fever/*blood', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/blood', 'Lymphoma/blood', 'Neutropenia/*blood', 'Prognosis', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/blood', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Type I', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Type II', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism']",2002/05/15 10:00,2002/11/26 04:00,['2002/05/15 10:00'],"['2002/05/15 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/11/26 04:00 [medline]', '2002/05/15 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1515/CCLM.2002.048 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Chem Lab Med. 2002 Mar;40(3):304-7. doi: 10.1515/CCLM.2002.048.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS AND RESULTS: Using a human whole blood assay the effect of ML3000 on the shunt of arachidonic acid to the lipoxygenase pathway when COX is blocked was studied. ML3000 (0.3, 1, 3, 10, 30 microg/ml) and indomethacin (0.3, 1, 3, 10, 30 microg/ml) concentration-dependently inhibited the synthesis of PGE2 (IC50 = 3.9 and 4.5 microM). In contrast to ML3000, indomethacin produced an increase of LTC4 of up to 155.5% of control. 5-lipoxygenase inhibition was further tested in a basophilic leukemia cell assay using RBL-1 cells. ML3000 (1-10 microM) inhibited the synthesis of LTB4 in a concentration related manner (IC50: 3.6 microM). In carrageenan induced rat paw edema, ML3000 and indomethacin completely blocked the formation of PGE2 in the inflamed tissue. The LTB4 production in the inflamed paw was reduced to basal levels by ML3000 (10 +/- 1.4 pg/paw saline control and 7.5 +/- 1.3-5.9 +/- 3.2 pg/paw ML3000), whereas LTB4 levels remained markedly elevated as compared to saline control by indomethacin (30.7 pg/paw). 5-LOX inhibition in the inflamed rat colon was investigated by measuring LTB4 synthesis. MK-886 and ML3000 at 10 mg/kg p.o. reduced LTB4 production to 29.8 +/- 4.9 and 30.1 +/- 2.8 pg/mg tissue as compared to control (54.2 +/- 7.4 mg/kg tissue). LTB4 levels in the rat stomach were comparable to control (2.5 +/- 0.4 pg/mg protein) after oral administration of ML3000 (10, 30, 100 mg/kg), whereas oral treatment with indomethacin (0.3, 1, 3 mg/kg) or diclofenac (1, 3 mg/kg) increased LTB4 up to 9.2 +/- 2.3 or 8.9 +/- 1.6 pg/mg protein. This effect was significant at 1 mg/kg diclofenac and 0.3 mg/kg indomethacin. CONCLUSIONS: These results provide further evidence, that ML3000 inhibits 5-LOX as well as COX-1 and COX-2 in vitro and in animal experiments. The favourable gastrointestinal (GI) tolerability of the compound is believed to be linked to the mechanism of combined 5-LOX and COX-1/2 inhibition of ML3000.","['Tries, S', 'Neupert, W', 'Laufer, S']","['Tries S', 'Neupert W', 'Laufer S']","['Preclinical Development, Merckle GmbH, Blaubeuren, Germany. susatrie@merckle.de']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Inflamm Res,Inflammation research : official journal of the European Histamine Research Society ...

The malignant lymphoid infiltrate was characterized by blasts, showing scant cytoplasm, irregular hyperchromatic nuclei, and occasional prominent nucleoli. They were immunoreactive for CD45RB, CD3, CD43, CD34, and focally for TdT. Curiously, the blasts replaced the endometrial stroma and spared the associated epithelium. The patient was again treated with chemotherapy but her disease did not respond. She succumbed to her disease approximately 10 months after her initial evaluation for symptoms related to ALL relapse. Precursor T-cell ALL most commonly presents as a mediastinal mass in adolescent males. Although any organ may be affected, involvement of the female reproductive organs is rare.

The purpose of this study is to determine risk factors, clinical characteristics, and outcomes of de novo nonlymphoid malignancies after liver transplantation from a large single-center series. All patients undergoing liver transplantation at the King's College Hospital (London, UK) between January 1988 and December 1999 were analyzed retrospectively for the development of de novo malignancy in the posttransplantation period. Records were evaluated for age at diagnosis of malignancy, cause of liver disease, interval from transplantation to diagnosis of malignancy, predisposing factors for the development of cancer, immunosuppression regimen, treatment of malignancy, rejection episodes, and patient survival. Of 1,140 patients undergoing 1,271 liver transplantations, 30 patients (2.6%) developed de novo nonlymphoid malignancy after transplantation. Skin cancers were the most common (n = 13), followed by oropharyngeal carcinoma (n = 2), bladder carcinoma (n = 2), acute leukemia (n = 2), breast carcinoma (n = 2), and various other malignancies (n = 9). The mean time of presentation of the malignancy after transplantation was 45.1 +/- 32 months (range, 6 to 133 months), and mean age at diagnosis of malignancy was 55 years (range, 34 to 71 years). The incidence of de novo malignancy was significantly greater in patients who underwent transplantation for alcoholic liver disease compared with other groups (P <.001).

DESIGN: Cohort study involving nation-wide linkage of HIV, AIDS and cancer registry data. METHODS: Association of cancer risk with immune deficiency was examined by analysing cancer risks in four periods between HIV diagnosis, AIDS and death. RESULTS: Linkage identified 196 cases of non-AIDS-defining cancer in 8351 people notified with HIV infection and 8118 registered with AIDS (total of 13 067 individuals). Overall, we found significantly increased rates of cancer of the lip, anus, Hodgkin's disease, myeloma and leukaemia. Of these cancers, in people with HIV infection who did not develop AIDS, or were more than 5 years prior to development of AIDS, only cancer of the anus occurred at increased rates. A significant trend of increasing relative risk of cancer with increasing time since HIV diagnosis was found for Hodgkin's disease and multiple myeloma. CONCLUSIONS: People with HIV with mild immune deficiency prior to AIDS were at increased risk of anal cancer, but this may reflect other risk factors. Other cancers occurred only later in the course of HIV infection. This is reassuring evidence that people with HIV who are only mildly immune deficient may not be at increased risk of non-AIDS-defining cancers, but larger studies with longer periods of follow-up are needed to confirm this.","['Grulich, Andrew E', 'Li, Yueming', 'McDonald, Ann', 'Correll, Patricia K L', 'Law, Matthew G', 'Kaldor, John M']","['Grulich AE', 'Li Y', 'McDonald A', 'Correll PK', 'Law MG', 'Kaldor JM']","['National Centre in HIV Epidemiology and Clinical Research, the University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia. agrulich@nchecr.unsw.edu.au']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,AIDS,"AIDS (London, England)",8710219,,IM,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/*complications/diagnosis/immunology', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Australia/epidemiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'HIV Infections/*complications/diagnosis/immunology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*complications/epidemiology/immunology', 'Registries', 'Risk Factors']",2002/05/11 10:00,2002/06/19 10:01,['2002/05/11 10:00'],"['2002/05/11 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/06/19 10:01 [medline]', '2002/05/11 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00002030-200205240-00009 [doi]'],ppublish,AIDS. 2002 May 24;16(8):1155-61. doi: 10.1097/00002030-200205240-00009.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All patients received B-DOPA and MVPP chemotherapy. The number of cycles of chemotherapy was adjusted in respective risk groups. In 13 children with stage IA and IIA disease with favourable prognostic factors chemotherapy alone was used. In other patients the dose of RT applied to lymphatic regions was 15-46,4 Gy. In case of a small tumour at presentation and good response to initial chemotherapy the RT dose was 15-16 Gy. In other cases doses of 25-30 Gy were planned. The use of higher doses, particularly exceeding 35 Gy, in eleven patients, was not justified. Among all the 167 patients, three oftliem (1.2%) with advanced disease (Stage III-1V) did not achieve first remission.

We report in this study that leukemic Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+)CD34+ cells from newly diagnosed CML patients that express the chemokine receptor CXCR4 migrate in response to stromal-derived factor-1 (SDF-1). However, normal Ph-CD34+CXCR4+ cells derived from the same patient have significantly higher migration levels toward SDF-1. In contrast to their transwell migration potential, the SDF-1-mediated integrin-dependent polarization and migration of the Ph+CD34+CXCR4+ cells through extracellular matrix-like gels were significantly lower than for normal cells. Concomitantly, binding of these cells to vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 or fibronectin, in the presence of SDF-1, was also substantially lower.

This morbidity is often due to the lack of specificity for hematopoietic cells. Therefore, the concept of targeted therapy for patients with hematologic malignancies has received attention for many years. The goal of monoclonal antibody therapy is to target specific cell surface antigens on malignant hematopoietic cells, while sparing normal cells and tissues. Currently, monoclonal antibodies are being evaluated for their cytotoxic effects as well as their ability to deliver toxic agents or radiation. Rituximab, a chimeric anti-CD20 antibody, has shown response rates of approximately 50% with minimal toxicity in patients with refractory indolent lymphoma. Campath-1H (anti-CD52) has shown encouraging results in patients previously treated for chronic lymphocytic leukemia, with response rates up to 33%, although with significant toxicity. Anti-CD33 antibodies are being used to deliver cytotoxic agents, such as calicheamicin to patients with acute myeloid leukemia with response rates up to 30%. In addition, anti-CD33 and anti-CD45 antibodies have been used to deliver radiation directly to leukemic cells. (131)I-labeled anti-CD45 antibodies are being studied in combination with conventional preparative regimens in patients receiving bone marrow transplantation. Lastly, the therapeutic agent STI571 (signal transduction inhibitor 571) has demonstrated the capability of targeting specific molecular abnormalities seen in hematologic malignancies. STI571 targets the tyrosine kinase activity of the bcr-abl fusion protein seen in chronic myeloid leukemia. STI571 has induced complete hematologic responses in up to 98% of patients evaluated in clinical trials.","['Countouriotis, Athena', 'Moore, Theodore B', 'Sakamoto, Kathleen M']","['Countouriotis A', 'Moore TB', 'Sakamoto KM']","[""Department of Pediatrics, Mattel Children's Hospital at UCLA, Gwynne-Hazen Cherry Memorial Laboratories, and the UCLA Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center, 90095-1752, USA.""]",['eng'],['CA068821/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Stem Cells,"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",9304532,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (CD33 protein, human)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived', 'Antigens, CD/immunology', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/immunology', 'Antigens, Surface/*immunology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Hematologic Diseases/drug therapy/immunology/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens/immunology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/therapy', 'Piperazines/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use', 'Rituximab', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3']",2002/05/11 10:00,2002/10/09 04:00,['2002/05/11 10:00'],"['2002/05/11 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/10/09 04:00 [medline]', '2002/05/11 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1634/stemcells.20-3-215 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells. 2002;20(3):215-29. doi: 10.1634/stemcells.20-3-215.,,,,,,,106,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The effect of macrolides in DPB is suggested to be anti-inflammatory rather than antibacterial. We investigated the effects of clarithromycin on interleukin-8 (IL-8) production using human peripheral monocytes and the human monocytic leukaemia cell line, THP-1. Bacterial extracts from Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Helicobacter pylori, as well as E. coli-derived lipopolysaccharide (LPS), induced IL-8 production. Clarithromycin suppressed this production in a dose-dependent manner in both monocytes and THP-1 cells (49.3-75.0% inhibition at 10 mg/L). A luciferase reporter gene assay with plasmids containing a serially deleted IL-8 promoter fragment showed that both the activator protein-1 (AP-1) and/or the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kapp aB) binding sequences were responsible for the LPS and clarithromycin responsiveness of the IL-8 promoter. Consistently, in an electromobility shift assay, LPS increased the specific binding of both AP-1 and NF-kappaB, whereas clarithromycin suppressed it. Moreover, LPS and clarithromycin regulated three other promoters that have either the NF-kappa B or the AP-1 binding sequences: two synthetic (pAP-1-Luc and pNF-kappa B-Luc) and one naturally occurring (ELAM-Luc). Our results indicate that clarithromycin modified inflammation by sup-pressing IL-8 production and that clarithromycin may affect the expression of other genes through AP-1 and NF-kappa B. In addition to treatment of airway diseases, the anti-inflammatory effect of macrolides may be beneficial for the treatment of other inflammatory diseases such as chronic gastritis caused by H. pylori.","['Kikuchi, Tohru', 'Hagiwara, Koichi', 'Honda, Yoshihiro', 'Gomi, Kazunori', 'Kobayashi, Takao', 'Takahashi, Hiroshi', 'Tokue, Yutaka', 'Watanabe, Akira', 'Nukiwa, Toshihiro']","['Kikuchi T', 'Hagiwara K', 'Honda Y', 'Gomi K', 'Kobayashi T', 'Takahashi H', 'Tokue Y', 'Watanabe A', 'Nukiwa T']","['Department of Respiratory Oncology and Molecular Medicine, Division of Cancer Control, Institute of Development, Aging and Cancer, Tohoku University, 4-1 Seiryo-machi, Aoba-ku, Sendai 980-8575, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Antimicrob Chemother,The Journal of antimicrobial chemotherapy,7513617,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Indicators and Reagents)', '0 (Interleukin-8)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Pancreatitis-Associated Proteins)', '0 (REG3A protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-1)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)', 'H1250JIK0A (Clarithromycin)']",IM,"['Anti-Bacterial Agents/*pharmacology', 'Clarithromycin/*pharmacology', 'Depression, Chemical', 'Escherichia coli/immunology', 'Humans', 'Indicators and Reagents', 'Interleukin-8/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/metabolism', 'Lipopolysaccharides/*antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Luciferases/genetics', 'Monocytes/drug effects/*metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/*physiology', 'Nuclear Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Pancreatitis-Associated Proteins', 'Plasmids/genetics/immunology', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Transcription Factor AP-1/*physiology', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/05/11 10:00,2002/11/30 04:00,['2002/05/11 10:00'],"['2002/05/11 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/11/30 04:00 [medline]', '2002/05/11 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/jac/dkf008 [doi]'],ppublish,J Antimicrob Chemother. 2002 May;49(5):745-55. doi: 10.1093/jac/dkf008.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous studies have not shown a strong link between these chemical agents and the development of chronic myelocytic leukemia (CML). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the increased risk of CML development in Iranian soldiers exposed to mustard gas during the war. Based on a descriptive study of 2,500 cases with documented exposure to various chemical warfare agents, 665 patients had documented exposure to mustard gas. We screened the latter using the leukocyte alkaline phosphatase (LAP) test and performed further cytochemical studies on cases with positive results. From among the 665 cases with documented exposure to mustard gas, 9 cases had LAP scores < 20; 2 of these 9 cases had CML and a score of zero (0.3%). We detected cytogenetic abnormalities in 7 patients with low LAP scores and atypical lymphocytes of 5-11% in 40 patients. The risk ratio of CML developing in victims exposed to mustard gas (cutaneous or respiratory) may be higher in comparison with the normal population, although confounding factors (e.g., the possibility of exposure to combined chemical agents, excluding patients who did not manifest blisters) limited our results. Because the increased development of CML in young patients with a documented history of exposure to mustard gas cannot be disregarded, further studies are needed.","['Ghanei, Mostafa', 'Vosoghi, Ali Akbar']","['Ghanei M', 'Vosoghi AA']","['Chemical Warfare Victims Research Department, Baqiyatallah University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran. m.ghanei@bmsu.ac.ir']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Environ Health Perspect,Environmental health perspectives,0330411,"['0 (Dermatologic Agents)', 'T8KEC9FH9P (Mustard Gas)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Confounding Factors, Epidemiologic', 'Dermatologic Agents/*adverse effects', '*Environmental Exposure', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Iran/epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*chemically induced/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Mustard Gas/*adverse effects', 'Risk Assessment', '*Warfare']",2002/05/11 10:00,2002/06/26 10:01,['2002/05/11 10:00'],"['2002/05/11 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/06/26 10:01 [medline]', '2002/05/11 10:00 [entrez]']","['sc271_5_1835 [pii]', '10.1289/ehp.02110519 [doi]']",ppublish,Environ Health Perspect. 2002 May;110(5):519-21. doi: 10.1289/ehp.02110519.,,,PMC1240841,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is characterized by non-specific symptomatology requiring a high index of suspicion on the part of a pediatrician for referral and diagnosis. It has peculiar biological features, unresponsiveness to treatment and poor prognosis. METHODS: Eighteen infants with acute leukemia were seen during 1994 to 2001 and were analyzed on the basis of clinical and laboratory data. There were 13 cases of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL), 4 cases of Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) and one case remained unclassifiable, as the surface markers could not be done. Morphologically 9/13 cases of ALL were of FAB L1 type and remaining of L2 subtype, and 2/4 cases of AML were of FAB M1 type and remaining of M2 subtype. RESULT: Clinical data was available completely only in 11 cases. Hyperleucocytosis was present in 4 cases, organomegaly in 8 cases and lympadenopathy in 5 cases.

Preclinically, 5FP demonstrated anti-tumor activity against colon 38 and P 388 leukemia models in mice. Using an accelerated titration trial design with one patient cohorts and initial 100% escalations, a Phase I trial was conducted to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of 5FP and describe its toxicity and pharmacokinetic profile. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 5FP was administered orally once daily for 5 days every 4 weeks. The initial dose level was 23 mg/m2/d. Using single patient cohorts, escalation proceeded according to accelerated titration 4B design, initially by 100% and subsequently 30-35% escalations (exact escalation determined by pill size) until dose limiting toxicity was observed. A total of 19 patients were enrolled with a median age of 56 years and median performance status of 1. Most patients were heavily pre-treated with chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or both, and patient population included a wide variety of tumor types. RESULTS: Dose escalation proceeded rapidly to 1715 mg/m2/d with the only toxicities observed being nausea and vomiting. The large number of pills necessary at that point required a formulation change, which resulted in appreciable hematologic toxicity. This led to rapid de-escalation of dose in subsequent patients, with the MTD finally being determined to be 625 mg/m2/d. The DLTs observed were grade 4 neutropenia for greater than 5 days and grade 3 anemia. Other toxicities included nausea, vomiting, fatigue, constipation and mucositis. Pharmacology studies confirmed that SFP was converted to 5FU in humans at all dose levels. However, the extent of conversion decreased over the five daily treatments, but returned for the subsequent cycle. The hematologic toxicity was not related to 5FU exposure per course. CONCLUSION: 5FP is a tolerable oral outpatient therapy. Accelerated titration was an efficient way of conducting this phase I trial. The recommended phase 2 dose is 625 mg/m2/d orally for 5 days every 28 days.","['LoRusso, Patricia M', 'Prakash, Sucharu', 'Wozniak, Antoinette', 'Flaherty, Lawrence', 'Zalupski, Mark', 'Shields, Anthony', 'Sands, Howard', 'Parchment, Ralph', 'Jasti, Bhaskara']","['LoRusso PM', 'Prakash S', 'Wozniak A', 'Flaherty L', 'Zalupski M', 'Shields A', 'Sands H', 'Parchment R', 'Jasti B']","['Karmanos Cancer Institute at Wayne State University School of Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, Detroit, MI, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article']",United States,Invest New Drugs,Investigational new drugs,8309330,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Prodrugs)', '0 (Pyrimidinones)', '1VXI7T1BI5 (5-fluoropyrimidin-2-one)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Biological Availability', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Fluorouracil/*blood', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prodrugs/administration & dosage/pharmacology/*therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Pyrimidinones/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use/toxicity']",2002/05/11 10:00,2002/10/03 04:00,['2002/05/11 10:00'],"['2002/05/11 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/10/03 04:00 [medline]', '2002/05/11 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1023/a:1014430216434 [doi]'],ppublish,Invest New Drugs. 2002 Feb;20(1):63-71. doi: 10.1023/a:1014430216434.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A phenomenon not clearly described is that of a side effect induced by one chemotherapy agent and later recalled when the patient is given a different chemotherapy regimen. Troxacitabine is an anti-leukemic agent which can be associated with palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome (PPES). Here, we report six cases of troxacitabine-induced PPES that was later recalled by various chemotherapy regimens. The recall PPES was mild to moderate and self-limiting in all cases. All of these patients recovered from the recall side effects with minimal medical intervention. We conclude that a recall phenomenon similar to that described after radiotherapy might occur after certain chemotherapy agents. This phenomenon should be considered when evaluating toxicity from chemotherapy, particularly when using new and investigational agents.","['Hui, Yuk Fung', 'Giles, Francis J', 'Cortes, Jorge E']","['Hui YF', 'Giles FJ', 'Cortes JE']","['Division of Pharmacy, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Invest New Drugs,Investigational new drugs,8309330,"['0 (Dioxolanes)', '60KQZ0388Y (troxacitabine)', '8J337D1HZY (Cytosine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Cytosine/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives', 'Dioxolanes/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Erythema/*chemically induced', 'Female', '*Foot', '*Hand', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Paresthesia/*chemically induced', 'Recurrence', 'Syndrome']",2002/05/11 10:00,2002/10/03 04:00,['2002/05/11 10:00'],"['2002/05/11 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/10/03 04:00 [medline]', '2002/05/11 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1023/a:1014421912799 [doi]'],ppublish,Invest New Drugs. 2002 Feb;20(1):49-53. doi: 10.1023/a:1014421912799.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

(1995) Russian J. Bioorganic Chemistry 21: 797-803]. We felt that these changes were due to alterations in the cellular pharmacokinetics of the analog in multidrug (MDR) resistant cells, as compared to that of Dox. To address this hypothesis, we performed comparative studies of the accumulation, retention and intracellular localization of H-Dox and Dox in Dox-sensitive murine leukemia cell line P388/S and its Dox-selected. Pgp-positive drug resistant P388/R subline. These studies were performed in the presence or absence of cyclosporin A (CsA), a competitive inhibitor of Pgp. Flow cytometric analysis revealed significant differences in Dox and H-Dox accumulation in P388/R cells when compared to P388/S cells. In P388/R versus P388/S cells, there was a 38-fold decrease in Dox accumulation, but only a 5-fold decrease in H-Dox accumulation, indicating over a 7-fold increase in H-Dox buildup in resistant cells. CsA did not affect uptake or retention of either drug by sensitive cells. However, coincubation with CsA resulted in a 54-fold increase in Dox accumulation and only a 5-fold increase in H-Dox uptake in P388/R cells, restoring anthracycline levels in P388/R to 100% of that found in P388/S cells. Once internalized by the resistant cells, H-Dox was retained better than Dox regardless of presence or absence of CsA. Confocal microscopic analysis revealed the presence of H-Dox but no Dox in cellular nuclei of P388/R cells. Thus, increased activity of H-Dox toward P388/R cells was correlated with its enhanced ability to enter and be retained in these cells, and also with redistribution of H-Dox into the nuclei of the resistant cells as compared to Dox. Overall, our findings support our initial hypothesis and provide evidence that H-Dox, a 14-O-hemiadipate of doxorubicin, is affected by Pgp-mediated MDR to a lesser extent than parental Dox due to changes iin the cellular pharmacokinetics of the analog.","['Leontieva, Olga V', 'Preobrazhenskaya, Maria N', 'Bernacki, Ralph J']","['Leontieva OV', 'Preobrazhenskaya MN', 'Bernacki RJ']","['Institute of New Antibiotics, Russian Academy of Medical Sciences, Moscow.']",['eng'],"['CA 16056/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R0-1 CA-73872/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Invest New Drugs,Investigational new drugs,8309330,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (doxorubicin-14-O-hemiadipate)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cyclosporine/pharmacology', 'Doxorubicin/analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Flow Cytometry', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia P388', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/05/11 10:00,2002/10/03 04:00,['2002/05/11 10:00'],"['2002/05/11 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/10/03 04:00 [medline]', '2002/05/11 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1023/a:1014415205955 [doi]'],ppublish,Invest New Drugs. 2002 Feb;20(1):35-48. doi: 10.1023/a:1014415205955.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Preclinical studies were carried out to assist in clinical applications. DOSE-SCHEDULE ROUTE TESTING: Single dose i.v. treatment with XK-469 produced lethality (LD20 to LD100) above 142 mg/kg. Optimum treatment required total dosages of 350 to 600 mg/kg. Furthermore, high individual i.v. dosages (100 to 142 mg/kg) were poorly tolerated, producing substantial weight loss (8 to 18% of body weight), poor appearance, and slow recovery (8 to 12 days). A 1-hour infusion of dosages more than 140 mg/kg, or BID injections 6 hrs apart, did not reduce lethality. However, lower individual dosages of 40 to 50 mg/kg/injection i.v. were well tolerated and could be given daily to reach an optimum total dose with minimal toxicities. Likewise, 75 mg/kg/injection i.v. could be used every other day to reach optimal treatment. The necropsy profiles of deaths from toxic dosages were essentially identical regardless of schedule (deaths 4 to 7 days post treatment). The profiles were: paralytic ileus or gastroparesis; GI epithelial damage; and marrow toxicity. Interestingly, the key lethal events were rapidly reversible and simple to overcome with lower dosages given daily or every other day. Based on these results, the high dose, Q21 day schedule should be avoided in clinical applications. Instead, a split dose regimen is recommended (e.g., daily, every other day, or twice weekly). XK-469 was also well tolerated by the oral route, requiring 35% higher dosages p.o. to reach the same efficacy and toxicity as produced i.v.. CROSS-RESISTANCE STUDIES: XK-469 resistance was produced by optimum treatments of i.v. implanted L1210 leukemia over seven passage generations. This leukemia subline (L1210/XK469) had reduced sensitivity to VP-16 (with a 4.0 log kill in i.v. implanted L1210/XK469 compared to an 8.0 log kill against i.v. implanted L1210/0). It also had a reduction in the sensitivity to 5-FU (with a 2.0 log kill in the implanted L1210/XK469 compared to a 4.0 log kill against i.v. implanted L1210/0). Other agents were approximately as active against the resistant tumor, including: Ara-C, Gemzar, Cytoxan, BCNU, DTIC, and CisDDPT. No case of collateral sensitivity was observed; i.e., no agent was markedly more active against the resistant subline L1210/XK-469 than against the parent tumor in mice.","['Polin, Lisa', 'White, Kathryn', 'Kushner, Juiwanna', 'Paluch, Jennifer', 'Simpson, Chiab', 'Pugh, Susan', 'Edelstein, Matthew K', 'Hazeldine, Stuart', 'Fontana, Joseph', 'LoRusso, Patricia', 'Horwitz, Jerome P', 'Corbett, Thomas H']","['Polin L', 'White K', 'Kushner J', 'Paluch J', 'Simpson C', 'Pugh S', 'Edelstein MK', 'Hazeldine S', 'Fontana J', 'LoRusso P', 'Horwitz JP', 'Corbett TH']","['Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Institute, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI 48201-1379, USA.

Measurement of 1O2 near-infrared (NIR) luminescence at 1270 nm in biological environments is confounded by the strongly reduced 1O2 lifetime and probably has never been achieved. We present evidence that this is now possible, using a new NIR-sensitive photomultiplier tube. Time-resolved 1O2 luminescence measurements were made in various solutions of aluminum tetrasulphonated phthalocyanine (AlS4Pc) and Photofrin. Measurements were also performed on suspensions of leukemia cells incubated with AlS4Pc, and a true intracellular component of the 1O2 signal was clearly identified. Time-resolved analysis showed a strongly reduced 1O2 lifetime and an increased photosensitizer triplet-state lifetime in the intracellular component. In vivo measurements were performed on normal skin and liver of Wistar rats sensitized with 50 mg/kg AlS4Pc. In each case, a small but statistically significant spectral peak was observed at 1270 nm. The 1O2 lifetime based on photon count rate measurements at 1270 nm was 0.03-0.18 micros, consistent with published upper limits.

Skin infiltration was the most frequent localization associated with a myelomonocytic differentiation. Although first remission was achieved by most children, risk of relapse seemed to be increased. This might be caused by the specific biology of myelosarcomas, but also may be the result of delayed or reduced treatment.

Although some of them could have been considered today as having Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, all 106 patients of our retrospective series have had CLL treatments. Slide review distinguished seven lymphocyte morphotypes. With minimal a priori assumptions, excluding in particular clinical staging systems, forty-five diagnostic features were analyzed in 37 patients. CORICO (Correlations Iconography), a purely geometric method, deciphered the multidimensional structure of the raw data. Probabilistic monoparametric tests were made on the 106 patients. In ten patients (Binet stages: 3A, 6B, 1C), at least 8% of the lymphocytes were cleaved. Unrelated to the prolymphocytes, this morphotype had neither links with the CD5+CD23+ (9/10 vs 80/86), FMC7+ (5/10 vs 22/62), CD38 (1/7 vs 7/64) markers nor with any major CLL laboratory values; only three links characterized it: no cases of mixed marrow infiltrate (nodular: 1, interstitial: 6, diffuse: 3; ns), a lower percentage of eosinophils (ns), and predominance of CD11c (7/10 vs 20/66, p < 0.02). In conclusion, in contrast to the PLL morphotype, or to the lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) activity, which was a strong prognostic factor in this series, an independent detrimental value of the cleaved morphotype has not yet been found. Our study shows that free of modeling constraints, this method makes possible a rapid and objective insight into variable interrelations. If further explored in a prospective study, this approach may contribute to the understanding of discrepancies in the literature.","['Gonzalez, Hugo', 'Maloum, Karim', 'Remy, Florence', 'Merle-Beral, Helene', 'Lesty, Claude']","['Gonzalez H', 'Maloum K', 'Remy F', 'Merle-Beral H', 'Lesty C']","['Department Hematologie clinique, Hjpital de la Salpetriere, Paris, France.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antigens, CD)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Cell Size/physiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/mortality/*pathology', 'Lymphocytes/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Models, Biological', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate']",2002/05/11 10:00,2003/07/12 05:00,['2002/05/11 10:00'],"['2002/05/11 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/12 05:00 [medline]', '2002/05/11 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10428190290012047 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2002 Mar;43(3):555-64. doi: 10.1080/10428190290012047.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There is, however, no clear information on its prognostic significance in advanced stages and on its role as an indicator for aggressive or indolent courses of disease. Therefore, sCD23 was measured in the serum of 145 patients at diagnosis and serial determinations were carried out for 8 years in 38 patients. The results indicate that in patients with identical clinical stages at first presentation the disease could take different courses depending on initial sCD23 concentrations below or above specific threshold levels (860 and 5900U/ml). sCD23 higher than these thresholds was associated with faster progression into upper clinical stages. Furthermore, sCD23-doubling time (sCD23-DT) indicated that patients with long DT progressed slowly, while those with short DT had more aggressive disease. Particularly in patients with advanced disease stages, long sCD23-DT indicated development of smoldering disease. Since sCD23 levels reflect total tumor mass, determination of sCD23-DT has probably a better predictive value than lymphocyte doubling time. It appears that B-CLL patients can be divided into different risk categories according to initial determinations of sCD23 and that sCD23-DT is an additional important parameter in predicting disease progression.","['Schwarzmeier, Josef D', 'Shehata, Medhat', 'Hilgarth, Martin', 'Marschitz, Ingrid', 'Louda, Norbert', 'Hubmann, Rainer', 'Greil, Richard']","['Schwarzmeier JD', 'Shehata M', 'Hilgarth M', 'Marschitz I', 'Louda N', 'Hubmann R', 'Greil R']","['Department of Hematology, Clinic of Internal Medicine I, University of Vienna, Austria. josef.schwarzmeier@akh-wien.ac.at']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)']",IM,"['Antigens, Neoplasm/blood', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/blood', 'Disease Progression', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*blood/*diagnosis', 'Neoplasm Staging/methods', 'Prognosis', 'Receptors, IgE/*blood/physiology', 'Risk Factors', 'Solubility']",2002/05/11 10:00,2003/07/12 05:00,['2002/05/11 10:00'],"['2002/05/11 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/12 05:00 [medline]', '2002/05/11 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10428190210323 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2002 Mar;43(3):549-54. doi: 10.1080/10428190210323.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The results of large phase II studies indicate that FAMP and 2-CdA are similarly active in CLL. Unfortunately, no prospective randomized study comparing the results of the treatment of CLL patients with FAMP and 2-CdA has been published so far. Significantly higher overall response (OR) and complete remission (CR) in patients treated initially with PNA than with chlorambucil or cyclophosphamide based combination regimens has been recently confirmed in five prospective multicentre randomized trials. These studies have also shown longer response duration in patients treated with PNA than with conventional chemotherapy. Overall survival progression free and events free survival were similar in patients treated with PNA and with chlorambucil or other alkylating agent based regimens. However, the majority of randomized trials were designed as cross over studies and most patients, treated with conventional chemotherapy were given PNA when refractory or in early relapse, which may influence the survival time. The results of a randomized study have shown a higher incidence of neutropenia and infections in patients treated with PNA than with chlorambucil. However. the frequency of autoimmune hemolytic anemia, pure red cell aplasia, secondary neoplasms and Richter's syndrome seems to be similar in patients treated with PNA and standard alkylating agents based chemotherapy. In conclusion, alkylating agents still have an important place in the routine management of the majority of CLL patients. They are in general safe, given on an out patients basis and significantly cheaper than PNA. PNA should be routinely used as second line treatment, and possibly as first line therapy in younger patients, who are candidates for potentially curative treatment such as stem cell transplantation and/or monoclonal antibodies.","['Robak, Tadeusz']",['Robak T'],"['Department of Hematology, Medical University of Lodz, Copernicus Hospital, Poland. robaktad@csk.arn.lodz.pl']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Purine Nucleosides)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/standards/*therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/complications/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Prospective Studies', 'Purine Nucleosides/standards/*therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Survival Rate', 'Therapeutic Equivalency', 'Treatment Outcome']",2002/05/11 10:00,2003/07/12 05:00,['2002/05/11 10:00'],"['2002/05/11 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/12 05:00 [medline]', '2002/05/11 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10428190290012029 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2002 Mar;43(3):537-48. doi: 10.1080/10428190290012029.,,,,,,,78,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

IGFs exert their effects through specific receptors on growing and differentiating blood cells as they emerge from their small pool of ancestral stem cells. The IGF system is complex as both stimulating and inhibiting effects occur by interaction of IGFs and IGF-binding proteins (IGFBPs). IGFs stimulate erythrocytes and lymphocytes but also promote leukemic hematopoietic cell proliferation. IGF-I appears to be correlated with hemoglobin levels in anemia and could also be of benefit for patients with bone marrow aplasia after transplantation. Hypersensitivity to IGF-I has been implicated as an underlying cause of polycythemia vera. Loss of imprinting of IGF-II is found in acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome. Apoptosis of hematopoietic cells is significantly reduced by IGF-I involving an intriguing signal transduction pathway.

It is located 6.5 Mb telomeric to HLA-A. The most common mutation of HFE, C282Y, has a Celtic origin and most patients with HH are homozygous for it in Northern European populations. While there is an enormously increased risk for hepatocellular cancer in hemochromatosis that is attributed to the toxic effects of iron, the risk for extra-hepatic cancers is also increased slightly. Recent studies have found genetic associations between several cancers and C282Y but only in the presence of a particular allele of the transferrin receptor gene. This suggests that the increased cancer risk is more likely due to the effects of iron. In childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), however, there is a strong association of C282Y with a gender effect in two different Celtic populations. This association does not require homozygosity for C282Y or an interaction with the transferrin receptor gene, and is male-specific. The other HFE mutation H63D does not confer increased risk to childhood ALL. Acute myeloblastic leukemia and Hodgkin's disease in adults do not have an association with HFE. Its male-specificity, occurrence in childhood and the lack of a gene-dosage effect suggest that the C282Y association in childhood ALL may reflect the involvement of another HLA-linked gene in leukemia susceptibility.","['Dorak, M Tevfik', 'Burnett, Alan K', 'Worwood, Mark']","['Dorak MT', 'Burnett AK', 'Worwood M']","['Department of Epidemiology and International Health, School of Public Health, University of Alabama at Birmingham, 35294-0022, USA. dorak@openlink.org']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (HFE protein, human)', '0 (Hemochromatosis Protein)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Hemochromatosis/complications/epidemiology/*genetics', 'Hemochromatosis Protein', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immune System/pathology', 'Iron Overload/etiology/genetics', 'Leukemia/etiology/*genetics', 'Lymphoma/etiology/*genetics', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Mutation']",2002/05/11 10:00,2003/07/12 05:00,['2002/05/11 10:00'],"['2002/05/11 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/12 05:00 [medline]', '2002/05/11 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10428190290011930 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2002 Mar;43(3):467-77. doi: 10.1080/10428190290011930.,,,,,,,136,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Lymphocyte trafficking and homing to specialized microenvironments is an active process that depends on the sequential engagement of adhesion molecules and activation through chemokine receptors. CLL B cells express functional CXCR3, CXCR4, and CXCR5 chemokine receptors that can direct leukemia cell chemotaxis in vitro. Marrow stromal cells, blood-derived ""nurse-like cells"", and extramedullary stromal cells of mesenchymal origin secrete high amounts of stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) and thereby can attract CLL B cells via CXCR4. In vitro, CLL cells are rescued from apoptosis by cell-cell contact with such cells. Moreover, we found that the capacity of these cells to protect leukemia cells from apoptosis in vitro is mediated, at least in part, by the SDF-1 chemokine. Taken together, these findings suggest that chemokines and their receptors on CLL B cells can govern the homing and survival of leukemia B cells in vivo and therefore may contribute to their noted resistance to chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. Conceivably, CXCR4, and possibly other chemokine receptors, may represent a novel target for the development of effective treatment of this disease.","['Burger, Jan A', 'Kipps, Thomas J']","['Burger JA', 'Kipps TJ']","['Department of Medicine, Freiburg University Hospital, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Receptors, Chemokine)']",IM,"['Cell Communication/physiology', 'Chemotaxis, Leukocyte/physiology', 'Homeostasis/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*pathology', 'Receptors, Chemokine/*physiology', 'Stromal Cells/*cytology']",2002/05/11 10:00,2003/07/12 05:00,['2002/05/11 10:00'],"['2002/05/11 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/12 05:00 [medline]', '2002/05/11 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10428190290011921 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2002 Mar;43(3):461-6. doi: 10.1080/10428190290011921.,,,,,,,46,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We analyzed nucleotide alteration of RIZ gene in human leukemia. The results revealed a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), T1704 to A, near the conserved Rb-binding domain, leading to an amino acid change, Asp283 to Glu. Interestingly, 17 of 21 leukemia cell lines are homozygous for the T1704 allele whereas only 2 of 20 normal subjects are homozygous for the allele. In addition, one base pair deletion in the poly (A)9 tract in the coding region near the C-terminal zinc-fingers was identified, resulting in frameshift, in 1 out of 17 leukemia cell lines, but no mutation in samples from 15 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and 6 patients with adult T cell leukemia (ATL). In the PR or SH3 (src homology 3) domain of the RIZ gene, no mutation was found.

Its use in psoriasis was first investigated in the 1950s and current interest in serious treatments for psoriasis, such as cyclosporine, has renewed interest in this medication. Newer therapies, such as PUVA and retinoids, have side effects as do some older treatments, such as methotrexate, which fell into favor at the same time 6-thioguanine was being investigated. Reexamining older treatments can open up new therapeutic options in difficult cases. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this article is to provide a comprehensive review of the literature regarding the use of 6-thioguanine in the treatment of psoriasis as well as an illustrative case report demonstrating the use and side effects of 6-thioguanine in a patient with pustular psoriasis. Topics reviewed include efficacy, side effects, laboratory monitoring, different dosing regimens, and proposed mechanisms of action. CONCLUSIONS: 6-Thioguanine has been highly effective in treating and maintaining improvement in patients with psoriasis. A study comparing efficacies with methotrexate would be extremely useful. Because of the possibility of severe bone marrow depression, 6-thioguanine is not a first-line treatment. However, with new dosing regimens, proper laboratory monitoring, and further studies, use of 6-Thioguanine could expand in the future.","['Sherer, Daniel W', 'Lebwohl, Mark G']","['Sherer DW', 'Lebwohl MG']","['Department of Dermatology, The Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, New York 10029, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,J Cutan Med Surg,Journal of cutaneous medicine and surgery,9614685,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Psoriasis/*drug therapy', 'Thioguanine/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use']",2002/05/10 10:00,2003/04/16 05:00,['2002/05/10 10:00'],"['2002/05/10 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/16 05:00 [medline]', '2002/05/10 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s10227-001-0140-8 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cutan Med Surg. 2002 Nov-Dec;6(6):546-50. doi: 10.1007/s10227-001-0140-8.

A multiplex RT-PCR assay was employed to assess the relative expression of the hMSH2, hMLH1 and hPMS1 genes, as compared to beta-actin, which was used as an internal control of gene expression. MSH2 was further evaluated at the protein level by immunohistochemistry. The findings were compared to those of a control group of lymphoid tissue specimens without evidence of malignancy (n = 6). Changes in MMR gene expression were observed in 10 out of 31 cases of the study group (32%). All three MMR gene transcripts were low in two out of six plasma cell myelomas, which had extensive bone marrow infiltration by neoplastic cells. The hMSH2 transcript was present in all cases of lymphoma, while the expression of hMLH1 and hPMS1 was significantly low in some large B-cell lymphomas (four and five out of 14 cases, respectively) and in mantle cell lymphomas of the blastoid type (two out of two cases). No MMR gene aberrations were found in seven cases of B-cell lymphocytic leukemia and two cases of mantle cell lymphoma of centrocyte-like type. These findings demonstrate that the expression rates of the hMSH2, hMLH1 and hPMS1 genes differ among various types of B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders, and suggest that MMR gene expression may be related to the natural history of these neoplasms.

We also used Southern hybridization to analyze the genomic DNA of those cases, which had aberrant transcription to confirm the lesion. A thymine/cytosine polymorphism at 8 bp upstream of the 5' splice acceptor site of exon 10 was observed in Raji cell line and two AML specimens without a resultant change in the expression of hBUB1. Reduced expression and aberrant transcription of the hBUB1 gene, which may affect the control of mitotic checkpoint, were detected in AML specimens by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis. Our study suggests that the mutation of the hBUB1 gene is a rare event in AML, and further studies are necessary to clarify its role in leukemia.","['Lin, Sheng-Fung', 'Lin, Pai-Mei', 'Yang, Ming-Chi', 'Liu, Ta-Chih', 'Chang, Jan-Gowth', 'Sue, Yu-Chieh', 'Chen, Tyen-Po']","['Lin SF', 'Lin PM', 'Yang MC', 'Liu TC', 'Chang JG', 'Sue YC', 'Chen TP']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital, Taiwan, ROC.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (BUB1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Bub1 spindle checkpoint protein)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Point Mutation', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational', 'Protein Kinases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/05/10 10:00,2003/07/12 05:00,['2002/05/10 10:00'],"['2002/05/10 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/12 05:00 [medline]', '2002/05/10 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10428190290006206 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2002 Feb;43(2):385-91. doi: 10.1080/10428190290006206.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among 67 patients with acute and lymphoma type ATL treated between January 1996 and December 1998, 42 patients died during this period and showed chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression. To characterize the relation between the severity of myelosuppression and the endogenous thrombopoietin (TPO) or granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) levels in ATL patients, we measured these hematopoietic factors using ELISA method. Nineteen patients with acute or lymphoma type ATL and 16 healthy individuals were examined. During thrombocytopenia, the serum TPO levels were significantly higher than that of controls (P < 0.0001) and were inversely correlated with the platelet counts (r = -0.687 P < 0.001). Later in the chemotherapy cycle, severe persistent thrombocytopenia occurred and TPO levels elevated and remained at a high level approximating the TPO levels of exogenous TPO administration (0.3 microg/kg body weight). On the other hand, the serum G-CSF levels with absolute neutrophil counts (ANC) below 0.5 x 10(9)/L were significantly higher than controls (P = 0.009) and inversely correlated with ANC (r = -0.382 P = 0.0034). However, G-CSF levels in six samples obtained after 6 h of G-CSF (100-150 microg per body) administration was approximately 50-fold higher than that in the neutropenic states. These findings suggested that G-CSF can effectively reduce the severity and duration of intensified chemotherapy-induced neutropenia and higher dose exogenous TPO (higher than 0.6 microg/kg per day) therapy may be required to enhance platelet recovery after intensive chemotherapy in ATL patients.","['Lin, Xiao-Yan', 'Hanada, Shuichi', 'Uozumi, Kimiharu', 'Utsunomiya, Atae', 'Suzuki, Shinsuke', 'Shimotakahara, Shigemi', 'Takeuchi, Shogo', 'Takatsuka, Yoshifusa', 'Arima, Terukatsu']","['Lin XY', 'Hanada S', 'Uozumi K', 'Utsunomiya A', 'Suzuki S', 'Shimotakahara S', 'Takeuchi S', 'Takatsuka Y', 'Arima T']","['The Second Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Kagoshima University, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '9014-42-0 (Thrombopoietin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers/blood', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*blood', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*blood/complications/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutropenia/blood/chemically induced', 'Statistics, Nonparametric', 'Thrombocytopenia/blood/chemically induced', 'Thrombopoietin/*blood']",2002/05/10 10:00,2003/07/12 05:00,['2002/05/10 10:00'],"['2002/05/10 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/12 05:00 [medline]', '2002/05/10 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10428190290006134 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2002 Feb;43(2):343-9. doi: 10.1080/10428190290006134.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab (R) has produced an overall response rate (ORR) of 50% as a single agent in relapsed or refractory indolent lymphomas. We posed the question whether a combination of the above agents (BMR) could improve these results. This study was an open label, single center pilot study for patients with relapsed or refractory, CD20-positive (indolent) lymphoma or chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. The therapy consisted of bendamustine (80 mg/m2, day 1-3), mitoxantrone (10 mg/m2, day 1), rituximab (375 mg/m2, week 2-5). BM was repeated on day 36 or when the haematological parameters had recovered. The maximum therapy consisted of one BMR-cycle, followed by five BM courses. Treatment was stopped when the disease responded with PR/CR.

The median age of the patients was 67 years (range 36-82) and their performance status ranged from 0 to 3. Median number of previous treatment regimens was two (1-6). Of the lymphoma patients, 14 had stage IV disease, 1 stage III and 1 stage II. B-CLL patients were all Rai stage IV (Binet C). Overall response rate was 95% (19/20) with seven patients achieving a CR (35%) and 12 patients achieving a PR (60%).

However, in a minority of patients with ALL, chemotherapy failure remains a leading cause of cancer related death, most probably due to cellular drug resistance. The better-known mechanism of such resistance is mediated by P-glycoprotein (P-gp). In a long term prospective study (mean time of follow-up: 65 months) the multidrug efflux pump P-gp was examined immunocytochemically in leukemic cells of 102 protocol-treated children with de novo acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and of 37 children with relapsed ALL. Fourteen percent expressed P-gp at initial diagnosis and 35% were P-gp positive at relapse. The patients being P-gp positive at initial diagnosis had a higher rate of leukemic relapse than the P-gp negative patients (P = 0.02). In the relapsing patients, those who were P-gp positive had a 2.18-fold greater risk for leukemic death than those who were P-gp negative. Paired analysis on diagnostic and relapsed samples from 20 patients did not support the hypothesis of P-gp mediated expression being a chemotherapy induced phenomenon. The cumulative event free survival for de novo ALL patients was significantly higher in the P-gp negative patient group. Multivariate analysis showed that P-gp expression is independent of other known risk factors.

Adults with ALL have a worse prognosis compared to children. This may be due to different, unfavorable biology, poor treatment tolerance, drug resistance, higher expression of drug resistance related proteins. The lymphoblasts from adult ALL show an increased in vitro resistance to cytotoxic drugs, including prednisolone, dexamethasone, cytosine arabinoside, daunorubicin, L-asparaginase and methotrexate. Glucocorticoid resistance may be a fundamental difference between children, adolescents and adults with ALL, which may underlie different biological aspects and also explain the difference in prognosis. It seems that in vitro resistance to prednisolone with respect to the age might be a continuous variable in ALL patients, except infants. The greater the age, the higher the in vitro resistance to prednisolone. This may be due to induction of various defense mechanisms, such as an activation of P-glycoprotein, which develops throughout the life and protect the human against xenobiotics. Among a number of various drug resistance mechanisms, only several weak differences between adults and children with ALL have been reported including higher P-glycoprotein expression, lower methotrexate polyglutamate accumulation and possibly more often p53 gene mutations in adults. Intrinsic resistance, induction of drug resistance proteins expression during chemotherapy and co-existence of various mechanisms are common phenomena in adult ALL. It seems that age itself, more than drug resistance profile, reflects factors which have direct effect on chemotherapy response in adult ALL.","['Styczynski, Jan', 'Wysocki, Mariusz']","['Styczynski J', 'Wysocki M']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Medical University, Bydgoszcz, Poland. jan_styczynski@kki.net.pl']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Child', 'Data Collection', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome']",2002/05/10 10:00,2003/07/12 05:00,['2002/05/10 10:00'],"['2002/05/10 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/12 05:00 [medline]', '2002/05/10 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10428190290006071 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2002 Feb;43(2):301-7. doi: 10.1080/10428190290006071.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It seems that this region might contain tumour-suppressor genes. Putative natural killer cell lymphomas/leukaemias (NKLL) represent a group of recently characterized haematolymphoid malignancies sharing an immunophenotype of CD3/Leu4- CD3epsilon+ CD56+, a genotype of germline T-cell receptor genes, and have a close association with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Deletion at 6q21-q25 was demonstrated in three recently reported cases of NKLL. Here we investigated the possible involvement of 6q deletions in the pathogenesis, and especially the tumorigenesis of NKLL. The regions of D6S1574 (6p25), DS276 (6p12), D6S257 (6q11), D6S434 (6q14), D6S287 (6q15), D6S292 (6q21), D6S308 (6q22), D6S264 (6q25), and D6S446 (6q26) were analysed by PCR in 25 cases of NKLL, including seven cases with chronic NK leukaemia, six with acute NK leukaemia and 12 with NK lymphoma. 6q deletions, especially 6q15-25, were frequently detected, but 6p deletions were not detected in any cases. Analysis of 6q21 showed possible deletion in two of seven cases (29%) with chronic NK leukaemia, three of six (50%) with acute leukaemia, and 12 of 12 (100%) with NK lymphoma. The frequency of deletion increased in clinical phases. In three cases with lymphoma, fluorescence in situ hybridisation was performed, which confirmed 6q21 deletion in two cases, although 6q telomeric and centromeric regions were preserved. The other case failed to show deletion. Our results suggest that 6q deletion, especially 6q21-25, might be involved in NKLL tumorigenesis, and support the presence of the tumour suppressor genes associated with the development of NKLL.","['Ohshima, Koichi', 'Haraokaa, Seiji', 'Ishihara, Shigehiko', 'Ohgami, Akiko', 'Yoshioka, Shingo', 'Suzumiya, Junji', 'Kikuchi, Masahiro']","['Ohshima K', 'Haraokaa S', 'Ishihara S', 'Ohgami A', 'Yoshioka S', 'Suzumiya J', 'Kikuchi M']","['Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, Fukuoka University, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 6/*genetics', 'Epstein-Barr Virus Infections/complications', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*pathology/virology', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/etiology/*genetics/virology', 'Loss of Heterozygosity', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/etiology/*genetics/virology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",2002/05/10 10:00,2003/07/12 05:00,['2002/05/10 10:00'],"['2002/05/10 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/12 05:00 [medline]', '2002/05/10 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10428190290006062 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2002 Feb;43(2):293-300. doi: 10.1080/10428190290006062.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, high-dose cytarabine (HIDAC) regimens correlate with increased morbidity and toxicity related mortality. Typical HIDAC regimens deliver 6 g/m2/d in infusion rates of 500-3000 mg/m2/h. However, pharmacokinetic measurements indicate that intracellular Ara-CTP formation is saturated at lower infusion rates than used in HIDAC schedules, probably causing cytarabine accumulation in the plasma and increased toxicity. It was our objective to investigate in a prospective non-randomized phase I-II study feasibility and efficacy of intermediate doses of cytarabine delivered at the presumptive saturating moderate infusion rate (mir-IDAC), as induction therapy in order to optimize intensified treatment for acute myeloid leukemia. Forty previously untreated patients younger than 60 years of age with de novo AML received intermediate doses of cytarabine (2-4 g/m2/d) at moderate infusion rates (250-667 mg/m2/h) over 6 or 8 h. Cytarabine was applied on alternate days (day 1, 3, 5, 7) in combination with an anthracycline as induction and consolidation therapy. Thirty-two of the 40 patients (80%, 95%CI:64-91%) achieved CR after induction treatment. Treatment-related mortality during induction chemotherapy was 2.5%. No cerebellar toxicity was observed. After two to four mir-IDAC courses stem cell harvesting was successful in 71% of the patients eligible for high-dose chemotherapy. After three years 56% (95%CI:40-72%) of all patients are alive and 59% (95%CI:42-76%) of the patients who entered CR are free of leukemia. In conclusion, favorable long-term outcomes and moderate acute toxicities were observed in patients with de novo AML treated with IDAC schedules delivered at moderate infusion rates (mir-IDAC) starting as induction treatment.

This cell line was resistant to nuclear apoptosis induced by various stimuli, and neither mitochondrial activation nor activation of caspase-3 led to DNA fragmentation. DNA in purified Raji nuclei was degraded in the presence of lysates from the apoptosis-sensitive cell line HL-60, whereas Raji cell lysates did not induce DNA fragmentation in HL-60 nuclei.

Expression of angiogenic polypeptides vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) associate with clinical characteristics in human leukemia and lymphoma, and their serum concentrations serve as predictors of poor prognosis. VEGF and VEGF-C also act as survival factors on leukemia. Furthermore, certain hematological malignancies both produce angiogenic or lymphangiogenic growth factors including VEGF and VEGF-C, and also express their receptors, resulting in the generation of autocrine loops that may support cancer cell survival and proliferation. Inhibition of the action of key regulators of endothelial cell growth, alone or in combination with other antiangiogenic drugs and/or established chemo- or immunotherapy regimens, is a potential target for therapeutic intervention in hematological malignancies.","['Orpana, Arto', 'Salven, Petri']","['Orpana A', 'Salven P']","['Department of Clinical Chemistry, Helsinki University Central Hospital, Finland.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Endothelial Growth Factors)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor C)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors)', '103107-01-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Endothelial Growth Factors/metabolism/physiology', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 2/metabolism/physiology', 'Growth Substances/metabolism/*physiology', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/metabolism/*physiopathology', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/metabolism/physiology', 'Lymphokines/metabolism/physiology', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic/*etiology', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor C', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors']",2002/05/10 10:00,2003/07/12 05:00,['2002/05/10 10:00'],"['2002/05/10 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/12 05:00 [medline]', '2002/05/10 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10428190290005964 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2002 Feb;43(2):219-24. doi: 10.1080/10428190290005964.,,,,,,,79,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One hundred and thirty-five patients who underwent allogeneic HCT (alloHCT) were studied for complications related to hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV). The median follow-up period was 24 months. Positivity for HBsAg was observed in 32 patients (24%) throughout the study. Twenty-six of the 32 patients were HBsAg carriers before alloHCT, whereas the remaining 6 became HBsAg(+) after alloHCT. Forty-two recipients were anti-HBs antibody (HBsAb)-positive, and 58 recipients (43%) were HCV Ab(+). Eleven of 26 (42%) HBsAg(+) recipients survived between >4 and >119 months. Six of 26 cases received transplants from HBsAg(+) donors, and, although they had not developed acute graft-versus-host disease, 4 of 6 died of hepatic and renal failure within 10 months after HCT. After transplantation, 5 patients showed serologic evidence of HBV reactivation, whereas 4 patients showed evidence of an immune response to HBV. Viral reactivation occurred during the tapering of the immunosuppressive agent. However, 3 of 5 were alive at the time of this report, suggesting that reactivation is not directly correlated with severe liver dysfunction. Seventeen patients (13%) of 135 recipients developed hepatic failure. Eight (47%) of 17 were diagnosed with fulminant hepatitis and 5 (29%) with veno-occlusive disease (VOD). VOD was observed in 12% of both HBsAg(+) and HCVAb(+) patients. In this study, the relatively high incidence of HBV events occurred after alloHCT, and, therefore, we should consider a protocol for active immunization of donors and recipients against HBV. Moreover, although the presence of HBV or HCV is not a contraindication for alloHCT, we recommend a careful follow-up of recipients after transplantation, especially during immunosuppression tapering.","['Hamaguchi, Motohiro', 'Yamada, Hironori', 'Gondo, Hisashi', 'Takemoto, Yoshinobu', 'Morishima, Yasuo', 'Kodera, Yoshihisa']","['Hamaguchi M', 'Yamada H', 'Gondo H', 'Takemoto Y', 'Morishima Y', 'Kodera Y']","['Department of Hematology, Nagoya National Hospital, Japan. hamaguchi@nnh.hosp.go.jp']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anemia, Aplastic/therapy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Hepatitis B/*epidemiology', 'Hepatitis C/*epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Japan/epidemiology', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Lymphoma/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/therapy', 'Retrospective Studies']",2002/05/10 10:00,2002/06/12 10:01,['2002/05/10 10:00'],"['2002/05/10 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/06/12 10:01 [medline]', '2002/05/10 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF02982051 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2002 Apr;75(3):324-31. doi: 10.1007/BF02982051.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tumor cell engagement rapidly activated PI 3-kinase in NK cells within 5 min, as demonstrated by p85 subunit tyrosine phosphorylation and its ability to generate phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate, PI(3)P, from PI. Wortmannin and LY294002 effectively inhibited NK cells to lyse 51Cr-labeled tumor cells at the same doses that blocked PI-phosphorylating function in tumor-activated NK cells. Immunostaining demonstrated that tumor engagement for only 5 min mobilized perforin and granzyme B from NK cells unidirectionally towards the target, and prior treatment of NK cells with either PI 3-kinase inhibitor effectively stopped this intracellular polarization. Lastly, ectopic expression of dominant-negative p85 or p110 mutant markedly suppressed NK lytic capacity.

The preliminary results of the ATAC study have shown that Arimidex is superior to tamoxifen in postmenopausal women with ER-positive early breast cancer in terms of DFS, adverse effects and prevention of contralateral breast cancer. However, longer follow up is required to assess the drug safety regarding bone mineral density and cognitive function. Letrozole seems to be superior to tamoxifen as a first-line therapy in ER-positive advanced breast cancer in postmenopausal women. Although the incidence of acute myeloid leukaemia is significantly increased (cumulative incidence at 5 years = 1.1%) in breast cancer patients receiving cyclophosphamide and anthracyclines, the risk of this complication is easily outweighed by the benefits of chemotherapy. Adjuvant clodronate was found to be associated with a significant reduction in the incidence of bone metastases during the treatment period. A randomised trial comparing axillary dissection and axillary radiotherapy (RT) for early breast cancer reported no significant difference in survival at 15 years. However, axillary recurrence was significantly increased in the RT group. hTERT protein expression by IHC was found to correlate significantly with breast cancer-specific survival. There is no evidence to support the use of IHC of the sentinel node in routine clinical practice.

Until recently, myeloablative regimens were considered mandatory for effective eradication of all malignant cells of host origin. Our preclinical and ongoing clinical studies indicated that eradication of host immunohematopoietic cells, including chemoradiotherapy-resistant leukemia, could be achieved by adoptive allogeneic cell therapy with donor lymphocyte infusion following induction of host-versus-graft transplantation tolerance mediated by engraftment of donor stem cells in the course of BMT. Thus, eradication of blood cancer cells, especially in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia and less frequently in patients with other hematologic malignancies, could be frequently accomplished despite complete resistance of such tumor cells to maximally tolerated doses of chemoradiotherapy. Our cumulative experience suggested that graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effects might be a useful tool for both treatment and prevention of relapse. Based on the aforementioned rationale, we speculated that the therapeutic benefit of BMT may be improved by using a safer conditioning as part of the transplant procedure, with the goal in mind to induce host-versus-graft tolerance to enable subsequent induction of GVL effects rather than attempt to eliminate host cells with hazardous myeloablative chemoradiotherapy. The latter hypothesis suggested that effective BMT procedure may be accomplished without lethal conditioning of the host, using a new well-tolerated nonmyeloablative regimen, thus possibly minimizing immediate and late side effects related to myeloablative procedures considered until recently mandatory for conditioning of BMT recipients. Recent clinical observations suggest that effective treatment of leukemia may be accomplished with a well-tolerated nonmyeloablative stem cell transplantation (NST) regimen, while avoiding immediate and late toxicity and minimizing procedure-related mortality. Taken together, our cumulative data suggest that high-dose chemotherapy and radiation therapy may be successively replaced by a more effective biological tool-alloreactive donor lymphocytes-thus setting the stage for innovative immunotherapeutic procedures for more selective and effective treatment of patients in need of BMT, including those resistant to conventional chemoradiotherapy.","['Slavin, Shimon', 'Nagler, Arnon', 'Shapira, Michael Y', 'Aker, Mehmet', 'Gabriel, Cividalli', 'Or, Reuven']","['Slavin S', 'Nagler A', 'Shapira MY', 'Aker M', 'Gabriel C', 'Or R']","['Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation and Cancer Immunotherapy, Hadassah University Hospital, Jerusalem, Israel. slavin@huji.ac.il']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Netherlands,J Clin Immunol,Journal of clinical immunology,8102137,,IM,"['*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2002/05/10 10:00,2002/10/17 04:00,['2002/05/10 10:00'],"['2002/05/10 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/10/17 04:00 [medline]', '2002/05/10 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1023/a:1014423617596 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Immunol. 2002 Mar;22(2):64-9. doi: 10.1023/a:1014423617596.,,,,,,,37,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is well established that all four Notch genes can act as oncogenes; however, the mechanism by which Notch proteins transform cells remains unknown. Previously, we reported that both nuclear localization and transcriptional activation are required for neoplastic transformation of RKE cells. Furthermore, we identified cyclin D1 as a direct transcriptional target of constitutively active Notch molecules. In an effort to understand the mechanism by which Notch functions in the nucleus, we sought to determine if Notch formed stable complexes using size exclusion chromatography. Herein, we report that the Notch intracellular domain (N(ic)) forms distinct high-molecular-weight complexes in the nuclei of transformed RKE cells. The largest complex is approximately 1.5 MDa and contains both endogenous CSL (for CBF1, Suppressor of Hairless, and Lag-1) and Mastermind-Like-1 (Maml). N(ic) molecules that do not have the high-affinity binding site for CSL (RAM) retain the ability to associate with CSL in a stable complex through interactions involving Maml. However, Maml does not directly bind to CSL. Furthermore, Maml can rescue Delta RAM transcriptional activity on a CSL-dependent promoter. These results indicate that deletion of the RAM domain does not equate to CSL-independent signaling. Moreover, in SUP-T1 cells, N(ic) exists exclusively in the largest N(ic)-containing complex. SUP-T1 cells are derived from a T-cell leukemia that harbors the t(7;9)(q34;q34.3) translocation and constitutively express N(ic). Taken together, our data indicate that complex formation is likely required for neoplastic transformation by Notch(ic).","['Jeffries, Shawn', 'Robbins, David J', 'Capobianco, Anthony J']","['Jeffries S', 'Robbins DJ', 'Capobianco AJ']","['Department of Molecular Genetics, Biochemistry and Microbiology, College of Medicine, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, Ohio 45267-0524, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA083736/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA83736-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MAML1 protein, human)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Notch)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', '*DNA-Binding Proteins', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/genetics/metabolism', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Membrane Proteins/chemistry/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Molecular Weight', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Notch', 'Repressor Proteins/chemistry/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Trans-Activators/chemistry/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/05/09 10:00,2002/06/12 10:01,['2002/05/09 10:00'],"['2002/05/09 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/06/12 10:01 [medline]', '2002/05/09 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/MCB.22.11.3927-3941.2002 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2002 Jun;22(11):3927-41. doi: 10.1128/MCB.22.11.3927-3941.2002.,,,PMC133837,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This region spans 68 kb and comprises the longest zebrafish genomic sequence currently available for comparison with mammalian, chicken, and pufferfish sequences. Our data show conserved synteny between zebrafish and mammalian SCL and MAP17 loci, thus suggesting the likely genomic domain necessary for the conserved pattern of SCL expression. Long-range comparative sequence analysis/phylogenetic footprinting was used to identify noncoding conserved sequences representing candidate transcriptional regulatory elements. The SCL promoter/enhancer, exon 1, and the poly(A) region were highly conserved, but no homology to other known mouse SCL enhancers was detected in the zebrafish sequence. A combined homology/structure analysis of the poly(A) region predicted consistent structural features, suggesting a conserved functional role in mRNA regulation.

In the present study, we demonstrate that transport of thiamine monophosphate (TMP), an important thiamine metabolite present in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid, is mediated by RFC1 in L1210 murine leukemia cells. Transport of TMP was augmented by a factor of five in cells (R16) that overexpress RFC1 and was markedly inhibited by methotrexate, an RFC1 substrate, but not by thiamine. At a near-physiological concentration (50 nM), TMP influx mediated by RFC1 in wild-type L1210 cells was approximately 50% of thiamine influx mediated by thiamine transporter(s). Within 1 min, the majority of TMP transported into R16 cells was hydrolyzed to thiamine with a component metabolized to thiamine pyrophosphate, the active enzyme cofactor. These data suggest that RFC1 may be one of the alternative transport routes available for TMP in some tissues when THTR-1 is mutated in the autosomal recessive disorder thiamine-responsive megaloblastic anemia.","['Zhao, Rongbao', 'Gao, Feng', 'Goldman, I David']","['Zhao R', 'Gao F', 'Goldman ID']","['Department of Medicine, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York 10461, USA.']",['eng'],['CA-82621/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Physiol Cell Physiol,American journal of physiology.

The marked cytotoxic potential of this drug may be the result of its interaction with DNA but the precise mechanism of action remains unclear at present. We have investigated the induction of apoptosis in human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 and murine melanoma B16 cells treated with S23906-1. With both cell lines, the drug induces cell cycle perturbations (G2/M arrest) and triggers apoptosis as revealed by the externalization of Annexin V-targeted PS residues at the periphery of the cells. But the biochemical pathways leading to apoptosis are different for the two cancer cell lines. In HL-60 cells, the drug induces significant variations of the Delta Psi(mt), measured by flow cytometry using the fluorochromes JC-1 and cm-X-ros. Activation of caspase-3 and chromatin condensation in HL-60 cells exposed to submicromolar concentrations of S23906-1 for 24hr were also clearly seen by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy experiments. In contrast, the extent of apoptosis induced by S23906-1 was found to be much more limited in B16 cells. No significant variations of Delta Psi(mt) and no cleavage of the fluorescent caspase-3 substrate GDEVDGI (PhiPhiLux-G(1)D(2) probe) could be detected by cytometry in B16 cells exposed to S23906-1. In addition, we characterized the mitochondrial production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) using the probe dihydroethidine (HE) and the variations of the mitochondrial mass using the cardiolipin-interacting probe nonyl acridine orange (NAO). S23906-1 stimulates the production of ROS in both cell lines but the number of mitochondria seems to increase only in drug-treated B16 cells. Collectively these findings identify S23906-1 as a potent inducer of cell apoptosis in the leukemia cells and to a lower extent in the melanoma cells.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed 493 patients with NHL who underwent ASCT at The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center between January 1990 and August 1999. RESULTS: With a median follow-up time of 21 months after HDT, 22 patients developed persistent cytopenia in at least one cell line with morphologic or cytogenetic evidence of tMDS or tAML. Univariate analysis identified prior fludarabine therapy, bone marrow involvement with lymphoma, and total body irradiation (TBI) as significant risk factors for the development of tMDS/tAML (P <0.05). Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that TBI was independently associated with an increased risk of developing tMDS/tAML (P <0.01). Further analysis of the patients who received TBI revealed that patients receiving TBI in combination with cyclophosphamide and etoposide were more likely to develop tMDS/tAML than those who received TBI with cyclophosphamide or thiotepa (P <0.01). The median survival of patients developing tMDS/tAML was 7.5 months (range 0-32 months). CONCLUSIONS: TBI, especially when used in combination with cyclophosphamide and etoposide as the pretransplant conditioning regimen, is a significant risk factor for the development of tMDS/tAML.","['Hosing, C', 'Munsell, M', 'Yazji, S', 'Andersson, B', 'Couriel, D', 'de Lima, M', 'Donato, M', 'Gajewski, J', 'Giralt, S', 'Korbling, M', 'Martin, T', 'Ueno, N T', 'Champlin, R E', 'Khouri, I F']","['Hosing C', 'Munsell M', 'Yazji S', 'Andersson B', 'Couriel D', 'de Lima M', 'Donato M', 'Gajewski J', 'Giralt S', 'Korbling M', 'Martin T', 'Ueno NT', 'Champlin RE', 'Khouri IF']","['Department of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030, USA. cmhosing@mdanerson.org']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Ann Oncol,Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,9007735,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/diagnosis/*etiology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/diagnosis/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/diagnosis/drug therapy/*etiology', 'Outcome Assessment, Health Care', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate', 'Transplantation, Autologous/adverse effects']",2002/05/09 10:00,2002/11/26 04:00,['2002/05/09 10:00'],"['2002/05/09 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/11/26 04:00 [medline]', '2002/05/09 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1093/annonc/mdf109 [doi]', 'S0923-7534(19)60946-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Oncol. 2002 Mar;13(3):450-9. doi: 10.1093/annonc/mdf109.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Trying to circumvent MRP-mediated resistance we designed and synthesized hairpin loops forming antisense oligodeoxyribonucleotides (ODNs), both phosphodiesters (PO-ODNs) and their phosphorothioate analogues (PS-ODNs), to reduce the protein expression by targeting its mRNA in a sequence specific manner. Melting temperature measurements as well as polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis supported the preferential formation of a secondary structure, which was expected to protect ODNs against 3'-exonuclease degradation. ODNs and PS-ODNs designed in this work were successfully tested as antisense inhibitors of the expression of MRP1 in the leukaemia HL60/ADR cell line. Foreseeing the necessity to perform clinical studies with such ODNs we investigated their stability against the 3'-exonuclease activity of fetal calf serum and human plasma. Under the conditions, corresponding to physiological ones, we observed high stability of hairpin loop forming ODNs, especially those containing longer (e.g. 7 base pair) stems. Comparative studies on the stability of chemically unmodified hairpin loop forming ODNs and their PS-counterparts indicated that endonuclease activity did not play any important role in the process of their nucleolytic degradation. Our studies provide strong evidence for high stability of chemically unmodified hairpin loop ODNs, making them an attractive alternative to phosphorothioate analogues commonly used in antisense strategy.","['Rebowski, G', 'Wojcik, M', 'Boczkowska, M', 'Gendaszewska, E', 'Soszynski, M', 'Bartosz, G', 'Niewiarowski, W']","['Rebowski G', 'Wojcik M', 'Boczkowska M', 'Gendaszewska E', 'Soszynski M', 'Bartosz G', 'Niewiarowski W']","['Department of Bioorganic Chemistry, Centre of Molecular and Macromolecular Studies Polish Academy of Sciences, Lodz. rebowski@bio.cbmm.lodz.pl']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Poland,Acta Biochim Pol,Acta biochimica Polonica,14520300R,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MSH3 protein, human)', '0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins)', '0 (MutS Homolog 3 Protein)', '0 (Nucleic Acid Heteroduplexes)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 3.1.26.4 (Ribonuclease H)', 'I38ZP9992A (Magnesium)', 'Y49M64GZ4Q (multidrug resistance-associated protein 1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cattle', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Magnesium/metabolism', '*Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins', 'MutS Homolog 3 Protein', 'Nucleic Acid Conformation', 'Nucleic Acid Heteroduplexes', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/*pharmacology', 'Plasma/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Ribonuclease H/metabolism', 'Temperature']",2002/05/09 10:00,2002/06/28 10:01,['2002/05/09 10:00'],"['2002/05/09 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/06/28 10:01 [medline]', '2002/05/09 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Acta Biochim Pol. 2001;48(4):1061-76.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A retrospective study was carried out in 204 children with a consecutive diagnosis of ALL, 89 females and 115 males, aged between 5 months and 17 years and 11 months, diagnosed between 15-4-1988 and 15-4-1998, and treated at the Division of Pediatric Oncology and Pediatric Hematology of Turin University using three successive generations of AIEOP protocols 88 (48 cases), 91 (86 cases) and 95 (70 cases). Observation of the patients in the study ended on 30-9-1998. The criteria for eligibility were those stated in the respective protocols. Seizures were classified using the international classification; the diagnosis was made if a doctor, a nurse or a reliable relative witnessed the event with confirmation by the consultant neurologist. RESULTS: Twelve out of 204 (5.8%) patients in this series presented seizures: 2 out of 48 cases using protocol 88 (4.1%), 6 out of 86 cases using protocol 91 (6.9%) and 4 out of 70 cases using protocol 95 (5.7%). None of the patients had critical episodes or other significant neurological pathologies prior to the onset of ALL, nor had they been affected by leukemic meningosis or undergone cranial radiotherapy. When evaluating the possible etiology, the authors noted that, except for one case of febrile convulsion, the seizures in the remaining patients could be attributed to the toxicity of chemotherapy. With regard to the evolution of seizures, only one patient died, whereas the others showed no neurologic sequelae. CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of seizures in children receiving treatment for ALL in the series analysed here is in line with that reported in the literature. Neurotoxicity caused by chemotherapy appears to be the main etiopathogenetic factor.","['Mainero, G', 'Barisone, E', 'Boffi, P', 'Farinasso, L', 'Landolfi, C', 'Dalponte, S', 'Sicca, E', 'Papalla, F', 'Miniero, R', 'Madon, E']","['Mainero G', 'Barisone E', 'Boffi P', 'Farinasso L', 'Landolfi C', 'Dalponte S', 'Sicca E', 'Papalla F', 'Miniero R', 'Madon E']","[""Divisione di Pediatria Oncologica Dipartimento di Scienze Pediatriche e dell'Adolescenza, Azienda Ospedaliera San Luigi, Orbassano, Torino.""]",['ita'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Italy,Minerva Pediatr,Minerva pediatrica,0400740,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Seizures/*chemically induced']",2002/05/09 10:00,2002/12/27 04:00,['2002/05/09 10:00'],"['2002/05/09 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/27 04:00 [medline]', '2002/05/09 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Minerva Pediatr. 2000 Apr;52(4):205-14.,,,,,Crisi convulsive durante il trattamento per leucemia linfoblastica acuta nel bambino.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Common secondary causes of osteoporosis were excluded in each case. Three of the cases responded to treatment with a biphosphonate. As these lymphomas share some common pathological and clinical features with multiple myeloma (MM) an association with osteoporosis is likely to represent more than a coincidental finding. The incidence of osteoporosis occurring with LPL will become clearer if routine imaging is carried out in patients at presentation. Issues relating to the treatment of the osteoporosis as well as the lymphoma arise in patients that present in this way. Based on the model of bone disease in MM, correlating serum levels of osteoclast activating cytokines such as interleukin-1 (IL-1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumour necrosis factor (TNF) with the actual finding of bone disease provides a basis for future research into the pathogenesis and management of bone disease in these rare forms of low grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.","['Atoyebi, Wale', 'Brown, M', 'Wass, J', 'Littlewood, T J', 'Hatton, C']","['Atoyebi W', 'Brown M', 'Wass J', 'Littlewood TJ', 'Hatton C']","['Department of Hematology, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford OX3 9DU, United Kingdom.

The patient with CLL was a 54-year-old female, who had had a squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) excised from her forehead 5 months before receiving the first course of fludarabine. During the fludarabine treatment, the patient developed a local SCC relapse and metastases in the neck. The carcinoma was treated by excision and radiotherapy, and further fludarabine treatment was withheld. Nevertheless, the SCC metastasized aggressively and the patient died 3 months after the start of fludarabine treatment, primarily due to respiratory failure. The autopsy revealed heavy SCC infiltrations involving the lungs, pleura, mediastinum, pericardium, and liver. The patient with HCL was a 69-year-old male. At the time of diagnosis of HCL, the patient had two solid tumors in the liver containing poorly differentiated epithelial carcinoma cells of unknown origin. During treatment with 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine (2CdA), the tumors in the liver rapidly spread in multiple intrahepatic metastases, followed by liver failure and death within 1 month. Fludarabine and 2CdA cause a substantial suppression of all lymphocyte subsets, in particular the T-cell line. T-lymphocytes are believed to be responsible for the usually slow growth and the low metastatic rate of the SCC skin lesions. It is therefore assumed that fludarabine and 2CdA in these two cases triggered an exacerbation of both tumors due to the T-cell depletion.","['Larsen, Christian Rifbjerg', 'Hansen, Per Boye', 'Clausen, Nielsaage Toffner']","['Larsen CR', 'Hansen PB', 'Clausen NT']","['Department of Internal Medicine F, Section of Hematology and Oncology, Hillerod Hospital, Hillerod, Denmark. rifbjerg@dadlnet.dk']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Nucleosides)', '146-77-0 (2-Chloroadenosine)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['2-Chloroadenosine/*therapeutic use', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/secondary/surgery', 'Female', 'Head and Neck Neoplasms/secondary/surgery', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Liver Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology/secondary', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', 'Neoplasms, Multiple Primary', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary', 'Nucleosides/*therapeutic use', 'Vidarabine/analogs & derivatives/*therapeutic use']",2002/05/08 10:00,2002/06/12 10:01,['2002/05/08 10:00'],"['2002/05/08 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/06/12 10:01 [medline]', '2002/05/08 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.10080 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2002 May;70(1):48-50. doi: 10.1002/ajh.10080.,,,,,,,,,"['Copyright 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, accelerated metabolism of ATRA that is induced by chronic daily administration of oral ATRA has been implicated as one of the mechanisms leading to a reduced sensitivity or resistance to ATRA therapy. We investigated the expression and regulation of CYP26, a novel p450 enzyme, which is highly specific for ATRA, in promyelocytic leukemia cells (NB4 and HL-60). We found that treatment of NB4 cells with a pharmacological concentration of ATRA (1 microM) induced rapid and dose-dependent expression of CYP26 mRNA. The CYP26 expression returned to pretreatment levels in both cells after ATRA was removed from the media. Retinoic acid receptor-alpha (RARalpha) specific antagonist (CD2503) totally abolished the ATRA-induced expression of CYP26 mRNA in HL-60 and NB4 cells. Furthermore, HL-60R, a HL-60 subclone expressing nonfunctional RAR because of a point mutation in the ligand-binding domain of RARalpha, failed to show CYP26 mRNA expression in response to ATRA. ATRA-induced expression of CYP26 was restored in HL-60R cells retrovirally transduced with RARalpha, but not in those cells transduced with the other retinoid receptors. In conclusion, ATRA induces expression of CYP26 in myeloid and promyelocytic leukemia cells and this expression is modulated by RARalpha. The induction of CYP26 expression by ATRA treatment might be related to a substrate-driven feedback mechanism to regulate intracellular concentrations of ATRA and its over expression in some clones may be partly responsible for reduced sensitivity or resistance to ATRA therapy.","['Ozpolat, Bulent', 'Mehta, Kapil', 'Tari, Ana M', 'Lopez-Berestein, Gabriel']","['Ozpolat B', 'Mehta K', 'Tari AM', 'Lopez-Berestein G']","['Department of Bioimmunotherapy, Section of Immunobiology and Drug Carriers, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Boulevard, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '9035-51-2 (Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (Retinoic Acid 4-Hydroxylase)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System/genetics/*metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'HL-60 Cells/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', 'Retinoic Acid 4-Hydroxylase', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'Tretinoin/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/05/08 10:00,2002/06/12 10:01,['2002/05/08 10:00'],"['2002/05/08 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/06/12 10:01 [medline]', '2002/05/08 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.10099 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2002 May;70(1):39-47. doi: 10.1002/ajh.10099.,,,,,,,,,"['Copyright 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To determine whether angiogenesis in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is an intrinsic property of leukemic cells, the vascularity of bone marrow biopsies was determined. Bone marrow vascularity in newly diagnosed or post-chemotherapy AML patients was increased 4-fold (P < 0.01) and 8.7-fold (P < 0.01), respectively, relative to controls. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression by AML blast cells was assessed by immunohistochemistry, and bone marrow cell supernatants were assayed for secretion of VEGF, fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2), and endostatin by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Diffuse cytoplasmic and strong extracellular VEGF immunoreactivity was seen in bone marrow aspirates from AML patients, but not controls. In contrast, there was no difference in the levels of VEGF, FGF-2, and endostatin secreted by mononuclear cells cultured from bone marrows of AML patients compared to normal controls following two days of culture in vitro. Total angiogenic potential of bone marrow cell supernatants was assessed by endothelial sprouting in vitro and by a chick chorioallantoic membrane assay. No differences were found between 2-day conditioned medium from normal and AML bone marrow mononuclear cells in either assay. Our data show a discrepancy between bone marrow vascularity and VEGF expression in vivo and VEGF expression and angiogenesis from 2-day conditioned medium ex vivo. This suggests that angiogenesis in AML likely represents a response to microenvironmental factors in vivo, rather than being an intrinsic property of leukemic cells.","['Litwin, Craig', 'Leong, Kevin G', 'Zapf, Richard', 'Sutherland, Heather', 'Naiman, Sheldon C', 'Karsan, Aly']","['Litwin C', 'Leong KG', 'Zapf R', 'Sutherland H', 'Naiman SC', 'Karsan A']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (Endostatins)', '0 (Endothelial Growth Factors)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors)', '103107-01-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 2)', '9007-34-5 (Collagen)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism', 'Collagen/analysis', 'Culture Media, Conditioned/chemistry', 'Endostatins', 'Endothelial Growth Factors/analysis', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 2/analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*complications/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphokines/analysis', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic/*etiology/metabolism/pathology', 'Peptide Fragments/analysis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors']",2002/05/08 10:00,2002/06/12 10:01,['2002/05/08 10:00'],"['2002/05/08 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/06/12 10:01 [medline]', '2002/05/08 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.10092 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2002 May;70(1):22-30. doi: 10.1002/ajh.10092.,,,,,,,,,"['Copyright 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Variant isoforms (designated from v1 to v10) are formed by addition of new exons to the extracellular domain. High levels of CD44v6 expression has been observed in some tumors and are associated with metastatic spread. The aim of the present study was to investigate and evaluate expression of the CD44v6 and v6-containing variants as a possible marker in chronic myeloid leukemia and lymphoma by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction.

The human cDNA microarray [9600 clones, including known regulatory genes and expressed sequence tags (EST)] with colorimetric detection was used to identify differentially expressed genes between early gestational decidua and villi. According to cDNA microarray analysis, we have identified 641 genes with highly expressed mRNA in both decidua and villi, 49 genes with higher expressions in decidua, and 75 genes with higher expression in chorionic villi. These differentially expressed genes were further grouped into categories by their putative functions, including: cell growth-related factors, hormones/cytokines, cell adhesion molecules, signal transduction molecules, apoptosis-related factors, cytoskeleton/extracellular matrix proteins, and EST. Immunohistochemical stainings of cathepsin L, leukaemia inhibitory factor-receptor, and proliferative cell nuclear antigen showed results consistent with the microarray data.

Factors such as dose rate delivered, tumor size, and radiosensitivity play a major role in determining therapeutic response, while target-to-nontarget ratios and, particularly, circulating radioactivity to the bone marrow determine the major dose-limiting toxicities. RAIT appears to be gaining a place in the therapy of hematopoietic neoplasms, such as non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, with several agents advancing in clinical trials toward registration, of which one has just been approved by the FDA. Although RAIT of solid tumors has shown less progress, pretargeting strategies, such as an affinity-enhancement system consisting of bispecific antibodies separating targeting from delivery of the radiotherapeutic, appear to enhance tumor-to-nontumor ratios and may increase rad doses to tumor more selectively than directly labeled antibodies.","['Goldenberg, David M']",['Goldenberg DM'],"['Garden State Cancer Center, Center for Molecular Medicine and Immunology, Belleville, New Jersey 07109, USA. dmg.gscancer@worldnet.att.net']",['eng'],"['CA39841/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA79857/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,J Nucl Med,"Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",0217410,,IM,"['Brain Neoplasms/radiotherapy', 'Breast Neoplasms/radiotherapy', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/radiotherapy', 'Female', 'Hodgkin Disease/radiotherapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/radiotherapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/radiotherapy', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/radiotherapy', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*radiotherapy', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/radiotherapy', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/radiotherapy', '*Radioimmunotherapy', 'Radiotherapy Dosage']",2002/05/08 10:00,2002/05/25 10:01,['2002/05/08 10:00'],"['2002/05/08 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/05/25 10:01 [medline]', '2002/05/08 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Nucl Med. 2002 May;43(5):693-713.,,,,,,,205,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The NFAT family of transcription factors is believed to play an important role in coupling these quantitative differences in TCR-induced signaling events into changes in gene expression. In this study we have specifically investigated the effects of sustained NFAT signaling on T cell activation by introducing a constitutively active mutant version of NFATc1 (caNFATc1) into primary murine CD4(+) T cells and examining its effects on gene expression. We now report that ectopic expression of caNFATc1 partially mimics TCR signaling, resulting in enhanced expression of CD25 and CD40 ligand and down-regulation of CD62L. More importantly, we find that expression of caNFATc1 in T cells maintained under either nonpolarizing or Th1-skewing conditions leads to a marked selective increase in the number of cells expressing the prototypical Th1 cytokine, IFN-gamma. Furthermore, when expressed in Th2-skewed cells, caNFATc1 appears to attenuate Th2 differentiation by decreasing production of IL-4 and promoting the expression of IFN-gamma. Finally, we find that caNFATc1 enhances expression of functional P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1, up-regulates Fas ligand expression, and increases susceptibility to activation-induced cell death, cellular traits that are preferentially associated with Th1 effector cells. Taken together, these results suggest that sustained NFAT signaling, mediated by ectopic expression of caNFATc1, acts to promote a Th1-like pattern of gene expression and thereby serves to highlight the important relationship between the degree of NFAT signaling and the qualitative pattern of gene expression induced during T cell activation.","['Porter, Cynthia M', 'Clipstone, Neil A']","['Porter CM', 'Clipstone NA']","['Department of Microbiology-Immunology, Northwestern University Medical School, 303 East Chicago Avenue, Chicago, IL 60611, USA.']",['eng'],['GM 55292/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Fasl protein, mouse)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (NFATC Transcription Factors)', '0 (Nfatc1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (P-Selectin)', '0 (P-selectin ligand protein)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '126880-86-2 (L-Selectin)', '147205-72-9 (CD40 Ligand)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/genetics/immunology', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/immunology/*metabolism', 'CD40 Ligand/biosynthesis', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Down-Regulation/genetics/immunology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Fas Ligand Protein', 'Female', 'Interferon-gamma/biosynthesis', 'Interleukin-2/biosynthesis', 'Interleukin-4/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis', 'L-Selectin/biosynthesis', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens/biosynthesis', 'Ligands', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/biosynthesis/physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'NFATC Transcription Factors', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'P-Selectin/metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/biosynthesis', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/*genetics/*immunology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Th1 Cells/immunology/*metabolism', 'Th2 Cells/immunology/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects/*genetics/*immunology', 'fas Receptor']",2002/05/08 10:00,2002/06/20 10:01,['2002/05/08 10:00'],"['2002/05/08 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/06/20 10:01 [medline]', '2002/05/08 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.4049/jimmunol.168.10.4936 [doi]'],ppublish,J Immunol. 2002 May 15;168(10):4936-45. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.168.10.4936.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we describe a system in which interleukin-6 (IL-6) signaling may be dissected using myeloid leukemic M1 cells. We utilized two properties of M1 cell differentiation to isolate IL-6-unresponsive mutants. First, M1 differentiation is associated with cessation of cell division. Second, differentiated M1 cells migrate rapidly and form dispersed colonies in agar. Mutant clones that are unresponsive to IL-6 are, therefore, large and compact as compared with clones derived from IL-6-responsive wild type M1 cells. Following spontaneous or chemically induced mutagenesis and selection in a high dose of IL-6, we isolated 27 M1 clones unresponsive to IL-6. Three harbored mutations that acted in a dominant manner, whereas 24 contained recessive mutations. gp130, an IL-6 receptor component, was affected in many mutant clones. We show that these clones display IL-6 and leukemia inhibitory factor receptors with reduced binding affinities and express gp130 at reduced levels. The IL-6-unresponsive phenotype of these mutant clones was fully rescued by the transfection of exogenous gp130 DNA. Therefore, this approach targets components of the IL-6 signaling pathway and may be suitable to study signaling from a variety of cytokines.","['Richardson, Rachael T', 'Starr, Robyn', 'Angus, Leecia J L', 'Hilton, Douglas J']","['Richardson RT', 'Starr R', 'Angus LJ', 'Hilton DJ']","['Walter and Eliza Hall Institute for Medical Research and The Cooperative Research Center for Cellular Growth Factors, PO Royal Melbourne Hospital, 3050 Victoria, Australia.']",['eng'],['CA-22556/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Il6st protein, mouse)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-6)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130', 'Interleukin-6/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/metabolism/pathology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mutagenesis', 'Receptors, Interleukin-6/metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/05/08 10:00,2002/08/13 10:01,['2002/05/08 10:00'],"['2002/05/08 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/13 10:01 [medline]', '2002/05/08 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M202189200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)66528-2 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2002 Jul 12;277(28):25624-30. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M202189200.

The conjugation step of lymphocytes and target cells is prevented by metabolic inhibitors and is dependent on temperature, increasing in the range from 2 degrees C to 22 degrees C. However, after lymphocyte-target cell conjugates are formed, they are stable at low temperatures (0 degree C) and in the presence of metabolic inhibitors. Thus, the formation but not the maintenance of lymphocyte-target cell conjugates is an energy-dependent process. In contrast to the conjugation step, which is influenced both by metabolic inhibitors and by temperature, the lytic step, which occurs only between 22 degrees C and 37 degrees C, is not affected by inhibitors of energy metabolism. The sigmoidal behavior of lysis as a function of temperature, showing a sharp inflection around 20 degrees C, can be explained in terms of the alteration of the viscosity of the membrane matrix of the target cells rather than as a general metabolic effect on the killer and target cells.","['Berke, G', 'Gabison, D']","['Berke G', 'Gabison D']","['Department of Cell Biology, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Energy Metabolism', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology/*metabolism', 'Temperature']",1975/10/01 00:00,2002/05/25 10:01,['1975/10/01 00:00'],"['1975/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2002/05/25 10:01 [medline]', '1975/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/eji.1830051004 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 1975 Oct;5(10):671-5. doi: 10.1002/eji.1830051004.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Only few data exist about the efficacy and side effects of methylphenidate treatment in children with this neurologic illness or history. The aim of the present study is to provide a review of this important clinical topic and perhaps to stimulate further controlled investigations.","['Weber, Peter', 'Lutschg, Jurg']","['Weber P', 'Lutschg J']","[""University Children's Hospital, Department of Neuropediatrics, P.O.

In this study, we have examined the mechanisms of apoptosis induced by altholactone, a stryl-lactone isolated from the Malaysian plant G. malayanus on human HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells. Flow cytometric analysis of the externalization of phosphatidylserine (PS) using the annexin V/PI method on altholactone treated HL-60 cells showed a concentration-dependent increase of apoptosis from concentrations ranging from 10.8 (2.5 microg/ml) to 172.4 microM (40 microg/ml). Pre-treatment with the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (1 mM) completely abrogated apoptosis induced by altholactone, suggesting for the involvement of oxidative stress. Further flow cytometric assessment of the level of intracellular peroxides using the fluorescent probe 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) confirmed that altholactone induced an increase in cellular oxidative stress in HL-60 cells which was suppressed by N-acetylcysteine. In summary, our results demonstrate for the first time that altholactone induced apoptosis in HL-60 cells occurs via oxidative stress.","['Inayat-Hussain, Salmaan H', 'Osman, Annuar Bin', 'Din, Laily Bin', 'Taniguchi, Naoyuki']","['Inayat-Hussain SH', 'Osman AB', 'Din LB', 'Taniguchi N']","['Department of Biomedical Science, Faculty of Allied Health Sciences, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, Jalan Raja Muda Abdul Aziz, 50300 Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. salmaan@medic.ukm.my']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Toxicol Lett,Toxicology letters,7709027,"['0 (Annexin A5)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Fluoresceins)', '0 (Furans)', '0 (Indicators and Reagents)', '0 (Pyrones)', '0 (altholactone)', '2044-85-1 (diacetyldichlorofluorescein)', 'WYQ7N0BPYC (Acetylcysteine)']",IM,"['Acetylcysteine/pharmacology', 'Annexin A5', 'Antioxidants/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluoresceins', 'Furans/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Indicators and Reagents', 'Oxidative Stress/*drug effects', 'Pyrones/pharmacology']",2002/05/07 10:00,2002/07/12 10:01,['2002/05/07 10:00'],"['2002/05/07 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/07/12 10:01 [medline]', '2002/05/07 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0378427402000255 [pii]', '10.1016/s0378-4274(02)00025-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Toxicol Lett. 2002 May 28;131(3):153-9. doi: 10.1016/s0378-4274(02)00025-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Kinetics of the drug release and in vivo efficacy.,101-11,"This study proposes a strategy to generate new anticancer therapy using hydrogel-based drug delivery systems to improve drug bioavailability and increase the therapeutic efficacy. We have synthesized biodegradable hydrogels based on N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide (HPMA) with prolonged drug release. Pharmacokinetic data from in vitro studies showed that the in vitro release of hydrophilic drugs (doxorubicin, vinblastine) from HPMA-hydrogels is affected mainly by drug diffusion and only partially by hydrogel degradation. The release of hydrophobic drugs (cyclosporine A, CsA) actually copies the process of degradation and therefore it is slower. Hydrogels with degradation time of 50 h released the doxorubicin over a period of at least 96 h after s.c. implantation. Drug concentration at pharmacologically active levels was maintained in the bloodstream over a period of at least 4 days, ranging between 0.1 and 1 microg/ml. The therapeutic potential of HPMA-hydrogels in vivo was studied in Bcl1 leukemia. HPMA-hydrogels containing DOX were significantly more effective in inhibition of Bcl1 leukemia in comparison with free DOX or non-targeted polymeric drug (PK1). The efficacy of therapeutic combination using unspecific, hydrogel-based therapy with specific, antibody-targeted therapy at late stages of Bcl1 leukemia was also tested. In contrast to application of DOX alone, a cocktail of DOX with CsA as a blocker of P-glycoprotein (Pgp) incorporated into HPMA-hydrogel blocked the proliferation of Pgp-overexpressing multidrug resistant cell lines in vitro by induction of apoptosis.","[""St'astny, Marek"", 'Plocova, Dana', 'Etrych, Tomas', 'Kovar, Marek', 'Ulbrich, Karel', 'Rihova, Blanka']","[""St'astny M"", 'Plocova D', 'Etrych T', 'Kovar M', 'Ulbrich K', 'Rihova B']","['Institute of Microbiology, AS CR, Department of Immunology, Videnska 1085, 14220 4, Prague, Czech Republic. mstastny@biomed.cas.cz']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,J Control Release,Journal of controlled release : official journal of the Controlled Release Society,8607908,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cross-Linking Reagents)', '0 (Delayed-Action Preparations)', '0 (Drug Carriers)', '0 (Drug Implants)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Hydrogels)', '0 (Methacrylates)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', 'UKW89XAX2X (hydroxypropyl methacrylate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Cross-Linking Reagents/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Cyclosporine/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Delayed-Action Preparations/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Drug Carriers/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Drug Delivery Systems/methods', 'Drug Implants/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Female', 'Growth Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Hydrogels/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Leukemia P388/drug therapy/pathology', 'Methacrylates/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/pathology']",2002/05/07 10:00,2002/08/06 10:01,['2002/05/07 10:00'],"['2002/05/07 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/06 10:01 [medline]', '2002/05/07 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0168365902000470 [pii]', '10.1016/s0168-3659(02)00047-0 [doi]']",ppublish,J Control Release. 2002 May 17;81(1-2):101-11. doi: 10.1016/s0168-3659(02)00047-0.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Vitilevuamide was cytotoxic in several human tumor cell lines, with LC(50) values ranging from 6 to 311nM, and analysis in a 25-cell line panel revealed a weak correlation with several taxol analogs. Vitilevuamide was strongly positive in a cell-based screen for inhibitors of tubulin polymerization. Vitilevuamide at 9 microg/mL (5.6 microM) had an effect equivalent to the maximal effect of colchicine at 25 microg/mL (62.5 microM). Vitilevuamide was active in vivo against P388 lymphocytic leukemia, increasing the lifespan of leukemic mice 70% at 30 microg/kg. We hypothesized that at least part of the cytotoxic mechanism of vitilevuamide was due to its inhibition of tubulin polymerization. Vitilevuamide was found to inhibit polymerization of purified tubulin in vitro, with an IC(50) value of approximately 2 microM. Cell cycle analysis showed that vitilevuamide arrested cells in the G(2)/M phase with 78% of treated cells tetraploid after 16hr. Therefore, vitilevuamide was tested for its ability to inhibit binding of known tubulin ligands. Vitilevuamide exhibited non-competitive inhibition of vinblastine binding to tubulin. Colchicine binding to tubulin was stabilized in the presence of vitilevuamide in a fashion similar to vinblastine. Dolastatin 10 binding was unaffected by vitilevuamide at low concentrations, but inhibited at higher ones. GTP binding was also found to be weakly affected by the presence of vitilevuamide. These results suggest the possibility that vitilevuamide inhibits tubulin polymerization via an interaction at a unique site.","['Edler, Michael C', 'Fernandez, Annette M', 'Lassota, Peter', 'Ireland, Chris M', 'Barrows, Louis R']","['Edler MC', 'Fernandez AM', 'Lassota P', 'Ireland CM', 'Barrows LR']","['Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT 84112-5820, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Depsipeptides)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Peptides, Cyclic)', '0 (Tubulin)', '0 (Vinca Alkaloids)', '0 (vitilevuamide)', 'EI946JT51X (dolastatin 10)', 'SML2Y3J35T (Colchicine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'CHO Cells', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Colchicine/pharmacology', 'Cricetinae', 'Depsipeptides', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Glioma/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia P388/pathology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Oligopeptides/pharmacology', 'Peptides, Cyclic/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Tubulin/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vinca Alkaloids/pharmacology']",2002/05/07 10:00,2002/05/23 10:01,['2002/05/07 10:00'],"['2002/05/07 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/05/23 10:01 [medline]', '2002/05/07 10:00 [entrez]']","['S000629520100898X [pii]', '10.1016/s0006-2952(01)00898-x [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2002 Feb 15;63(4):707-15. doi: 10.1016/s0006-2952(01)00898-x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In previous studies, it has been demonstrated that AG957-associated down-regulation of bcr-abl activates the cytochrome c/Apaf-1/caspase-9 pathway and induces apoptosis in chronic myelogenous leukemia blasts and progenitor cells. While AG957 has been purported to have specificity for the p210(bcr-abl) kinase, antiproliferative effects of AG957 in normal T-lymphocytes and bcr-abl negative leukemia cells suggest that other targets, such as c-CBL, may be substrates. In this study, we explored the mechanisms of AG957-mediated growth inhibition and apoptosis in the p210(bcr-abl) negative leukemia cell lines Nalm-6 and Jurkat, and demonstrate that AG957-mediated apoptosis is associated with altered phosphorylation of Akt and BAD, which destabilizes the Bcl-xL/BAD complex and releases the block to apoptosis. We, therefore, propose that AG957 induces apoptosis in bcr-abl negative hematopoietic cells by affecting the phosphorylation state of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase/Akt.","['Urbano, Alexander', 'Gorgun, Gullu', 'Foss, Francine']","['Urbano A', 'Gorgun G', 'Foss F']","['Hematology Oncology and Experimental Therapeutics, Tufts New England Medical Center, Boston, MA 02111, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (BAD protein, human)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Tyrphostins)', '0 (bcl-Associated Death Protein)', '0 (tyrphostin AG957)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (AKT1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Blotting, Western', 'Carrier Proteins/metabolism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', '*Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tyrphostins/*pharmacology', 'bcl-Associated Death Protein']",2002/05/07 10:00,2002/05/23 10:01,['2002/05/07 10:00'],"['2002/05/07 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/05/23 10:01 [medline]', '2002/05/07 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0006295201009169 [pii]', '10.1016/s0006-2952(01)00916-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2002 Feb 15;63(4):689-92. doi: 10.1016/s0006-2952(01)00916-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We performed a cohort study of live births, 1950-1991 in Cumbria, followed up to age 25 years or the end of 1991, comparing the risk of leukaemia/non-Hodgkin's lymphoma among all 9,859 children of male radiation workers to that among all 256,851 children of non-Sellafield fathers. Children of radiation workers had a higher risk of leukaemia/non-Hodgkin's lymphoma than other children [rate ratio (RR) = 1.9, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.0-3.1, p = 0.05]. Adjustment for population mixing greatly reduced the excess risk in the village of Seascale, adjacent to Sellafield, but had little effect elsewhere. The risk increased significantly with father's total preconceptional external radiation dose (RR(100mSv) = 1.6, 95% CI 1.0-2.2, p = 0.05). This dose-response was not reduced by adjustment for population mixing. Although our 13 exposed cases included 10 considered previously (Gardner et al., BMJ 1990;300:423-34), we used a cohort rather than a case-control design, with wider temporal and geographic boundaries, and confirmed the statistical association between father's preconceptional irradiation and child's risk of leukaemia/non-Hodgkin's lymphoma that they reported.

Compared to uninfected cells, higher expression levels of cyclin D1 and D2 mRNA were detected in HTLV-I-infected T-cell lines, which were at least in part mediated by the viral transforming protein Tax since Tax activated both cyclin D1 and D2 promoters in the human T-cell line Jurkat. A Tax mutant that did not activate NF-kappaB failed to activate cyclin D1 and D2 promoters. Inhibitors of NF-kappaB (dominant negative IkappaBs mutants) suppressed Tax-dependent activation of cyclin D1 and D2 promoters, indicating that Tax-induced activation was mediated by NF-kappaB. Wild-type and mutant Tax capable of activating NF-kappaB, but not Tax mutant incapable of activating NF-kappaB, converted cell growth of a T-cell line from being IL-2-dependent to being IL-2-independent; and this conversion was associated with IL-2-independent induction of cyclins D1 and D2. Our data suggest that induction of cyclins D1 and D2 by Tax is involved in IL-2-independent cell-cycle progression as well as IL-2-independent transformation of primary human T cells by HTLV-I.

Nevertheless, there have been very few reports on the late effects, especially pituitary function and growth, in long-term survivors who were treated with 18 Gy cranial irradiation in childhood. The subjects consisted of 35 children with ALL who were treated with prophylactic 18 Gy cranial irradiation at Kanagawa Children's Medical Center between October 1981 and February 1995. All patients received cranial irradiation after first attaining complete remission with induction chemotherapy, according to the treatment protocols prescribed by the Tokyo Children's Leukemia Study Group (TCLSG) and Tokyo Children's Cancer Study Group (TCCSG). Their ages at the time of cranial irradiation ranged from 2.2-15.0 years (mean 6.8). We evaluated their pituitary functions by measuring their pituitary hormone values 0.7-11.3 years (mean 6.0) after cranial irradiation and their growth by analyzing their height standard deviation score (SDS) at diagnosis of ALL and their final height SDS at the mean follow-up period of 8.2 years after cranial irradiation. Height SDS is defined as the difference between the patient's height and the mean height of their age and sex, divided by the standard deviation of their age and sex. Eight of 35 patients had ALL relapse, involving the bone marrow in seven patients and the CNS in only one. Six of the eight patients with relapse died 1.5-6.6 years after cranial irradiation and the other two patients were salvaged by further intensive therapies. The remaining 27 relapse-free patients have survived for 1.4-15.8 years (mean 10.1) after cranial irradiation. Twenty-six of the 29 survivors are long-term survivors of more than 5 years. Although there was one patient with an abnormal result in each value of growth hormone (GH), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), and prolactin (PRL), and two patients with abnormal results in thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) values, none of the patients had clinical symptoms of pituitary hormone abnormality and none required hormone supplements. The final height SDS decreased significantly compared with the height SDS at diagnosis of ALL in the long-term survivors (P = 0.001) and the height SDS of the patients who had received cranial irradiation at a young age tended to decrease gradually (P = 0.019). However, no patient showed severe growth failure. It is considered that prophylactic 18 Gy cranial irradiation plus chemotherapy for ALL in childhood can effectively prevent CNS relapse and is unlikely to produce clinically significant late effects, although it may cause slight pituitary hormone abnormality.","['Hata, M', 'Ogino, I', 'Aida, N', 'Saito, K', 'Omura, M', 'Kigasawa, H', 'Toyoda, Y', 'Tachibana, K', 'Matsubara, S', 'Inoue, T']","['Hata M', 'Ogino I', 'Aida N', 'Saito K', 'Omura M', 'Kigasawa H', 'Toyoda Y', 'Tachibana K', 'Matsubara S', 'Inoue T']","['Department of Radiology, Yokohama City University, School of Medicine, Yokohama, Japan. mhata@syd.odn.ne.jp']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,['0 (Pituitary Hormones)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Body Height', 'Brain/*radiation effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Pituitary Gland/*radiation effects', 'Pituitary Hormones/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*radiotherapy', 'Radiotherapy/*methods', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",2002/05/07 10:00,2002/06/18 10:01,['2002/05/07 10:00'],"['2002/05/07 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/06/18 10:01 [medline]', '2002/05/07 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.10348 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2001;96 Suppl:117-24. doi: 10.1002/ijc.10348.,,,,,,,,,"['Copyright 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the viral elements required for successful integration have been extensively characterized, little is known about the host DNA structure constituting preferred targets for proviral integration. In order to elucidate the mechanism for the target selection, comparison of host DNA sequences at proviral integration sites may be useful. To achieve simultaneous analysis of the upstream and downstream host DNA sequences flanking each proviral integration site, a Moloney murine leukemia virus-based retroviral vector was designed so that its integrated provirus could be removed by Cre-loxP homologous recombination, leaving a solo long terminal repeat (LTR). Taking advantage of the solo LTR, inverse PCR was carried out to amplify both the upstream and downstream cellular flanking DNA. The method called solo LTR inverse PCR, or SLIP, proved useful for simultaneously cloning the upstream and downstream flanking sequences of individual proviral integration sites from the polyclonal population of cells harboring provirus at different chromosomal sites. By the SLIP method, nucleotide sequences corresponding to 38 independent proviral integration targets were determined and, interestingly, atypical virus-host DNA junction structures were found in more than 20% of the cases. Characterization of retroviral integration sites using the SLIP method may provide useful insights into the mechanism for proviral integration and its target selection.","['Jin, Yi Feng', 'Ishibashi, Toshio', 'Nomoto, Akio', 'Masuda, Michiaki']","['Jin YF', 'Ishibashi T', 'Nomoto A', 'Masuda M']","['Department of Microbiology, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo 113-0033, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', '*DNA, Viral', 'Gene Duplication', 'Gene Library', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Proviruses/*genetics', '*Terminal Repeat Sequences', 'Virus Integration/*genetics']",2002/05/07 10:00,2002/06/11 10:01,['2002/05/07 10:00'],"['2002/05/07 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/06/11 10:01 [medline]', '2002/05/07 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/jvi.76.11.5540-5547.2002 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2002 Jun;76(11):5540-7. doi: 10.1128/jvi.76.11.5540-5547.2002.,,,PMC137013,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We previously identified a nuclear localization signal in the integrase protein of an oncoretrovirus, avian sarcoma virus (ASV), suggesting an active import mechanism for the integrase-DNA complex (G. Kukolj, R. A. Katz, and A. M. Skalka, Gene 223:157-163, 1998). Here, we have evaluated the requirement for mitosis in nuclear import and integration of ASV DNA. Using a modified ASV encoding a murine leukemia virus amphotropic env gene and a green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter gene, DNA nuclear import was measured in cell cycle-arrested avian (DF-1) as well as human (HeLa) and mouse cells. The results showed efficient accumulation of nuclear forms of ASV DNA in gamma-irradiation-arrested cells. Efficient transduction of a GFP reporter gene was also observed after infection of cells that were arrested with gamma-irradiation, mitomycin C, nocodazole, or aphidicolin, confirming that nuclear import and integration of ASV DNA can occur in the absence of mitosis. By monitoring GFP expression in individual cells, we also obtained evidence for nuclear import of viral DNA during interphase in cycling cells. Lastly, we observed that ASV can transduce postmitotic mouse neurons. These results support an active nuclear import mechanism for the oncoretrovirus ASV and suggest that this mechanism can operate in both nondividing and dividing cells.","['Katz, Richard A', 'Greger, James G', 'Darby, Kristen', 'Boimel, Pamela', 'Rall, Glenn F', 'Skalka, Anna Marie']","['Katz RA', 'Greger JG', 'Darby K', 'Boimel P', 'Rall GF', 'Skalka AM']","['Institute for Cancer Research, Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19111, USA.

Moreover, the association of functional protein forms of each member of the p33(ING1b)/p53 complex is essential for optimum activity of p53. The present report describes the sequencing of cDNAs corresponding to the p33(ING1b) mRNAs in a series of normal and tumor cell lines, and the production of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) reactive with p33(ING1b). These antibodies were subsequently used to analyze p33(ING1b) expression in normal and tumor cell lines and tissues. No evidence of mutation of p33(ING1b) was found in any of the 15 tumor cell lines cDNAs studied. Our investigation of a wide range of normal tissues have shown that expression of the nuclear epitope is highly ubiquitous, whereas expression of the cytoplasmic form could be detected in only 50% of tissues studied. Considering neoplastic tissues, loss of nuclear p33(ING1b) was observed in melanoma, seminoma, papillary thyroid carcinoma, ductal breast carcinoma, and acute lymphoblastic leukemia. As with normal tissue, cytoplasmic p33(ING1b) was more restricted, being observed in around 30% of neoplastic tissues, but in melanoma, papillary thyroid carcinoma, ductal breast carcinoma, there was increased detection of cytoplasmic p33(ING1b) associated with concomitant loss of nuclear expression. These results may suggest that at least in some tumors, loss of effective p33(ING1b) function may be achieved by translocation to the cytoplasm or failure of nuclear localization.","['Nouman, Ghassan S', 'Angus, Brian', 'Lunec, John', 'Crosier, Steve', 'Lodge, Andrew', 'Anderson, John J']","['Nouman GS', 'Angus B', 'Lunec J', 'Crosier S', 'Lodge A', 'Anderson JJ']","['Department of Pathology, Royal Victoria Infirmary, Newcastle upon Tyne, NE1 4PH, UK.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Hybrid Hybridomics,Hybridoma and hybridomics,101131136,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (ING1 protein, human)', '0 (Inhibitor of Growth Protein 1)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",IM,"['Adenoma/metabolism', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Breast Neoplasms/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', 'DNA/metabolism', 'DNA, Complementary/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Inhibitor of Growth Protein 1', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Melanoma/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nuclear Proteins', 'Protein Binding', '*Protein Biosynthesis', 'Proteins/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Thymidine/metabolism', 'Thyroid Neoplasms/metabolism', 'Tissue Distribution', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",2002/05/07 10:00,2002/10/09 04:00,['2002/05/07 10:00'],"['2002/05/07 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/10/09 04:00 [medline]', '2002/05/07 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/15368590252917584 [doi]'],ppublish,Hybrid Hybridomics. 2002 Feb;21(1):1-10. doi: 10.1089/15368590252917584.,['GENBANK/AJ310392'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The helper-dependent adenovirus (HDAd) can accommodate large inserts, provide high titers, and infect nondividing as well as dividing cells. However, adenoviral DNA is rarely integrated into the host cell genome, and its episomal expression is transient. Therefore we inserted a replication-competent, ecotropic retrovirus vector containing the green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter gene as a second-stage component. The well-characterized host species tropism of each vector component provided a stringent biological assay system that demonstrates the two-stage transduction mechanism of the hybrid vector, because the adenovirus stage can efficiently transduce human cells but cannot replicate in murine cells, and conversely, the ecotropic retrovirus stage cannot enter human cells but can efficiently proliferate in murine cells, resulting in permanent integration and progressive spread of reporter gene expression.","['Soifer, Harris', 'Higo, Collin', 'Logg, Christopher R', 'Jih, Lily Ja-Lu', 'Shichinohe, Toshiaki', 'Harboe-Schmidt, Erik', 'Mitani, Kohnosuke', 'Kasahara, Noriyuki']","['Soifer H', 'Higo C', 'Logg CR', 'Jih LJ', 'Shichinohe T', 'Harboe-Schmidt E', 'Mitani K', 'Kasahara N']","['Institute for Genetic Medicine, University of Southern California, 2250 Alcazar Street, CSC-240, Los Angeles, California 90033, USA.']",['eng'],['R21DK54280/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Ther,Molecular therapy : the journal of the American Society of Gene Therapy,100890581,"['0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Cre recombinase)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Integrases)']",IM,"['Adenoviridae/*genetics', 'Animals', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Genetic Therapy', 'Genetic Vectors/*genetics', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'Humans', 'Integrases', 'Luminescent Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Plasmids', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'Terminal Repeat Sequences', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Transgenes', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Viral Proteins', 'Virus Integration']",2002/05/07 10:00,2002/09/13 10:01,['2002/05/07 10:00'],"['2002/05/07 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/13 10:01 [medline]', '2002/05/07 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1006/mthe.2002.0586 [doi]', 'S1525-0016(02)90586-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Mol Ther. 2002 May;5(5 Pt 1):599-608. doi: 10.1006/mthe.2002.0586.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['Mol Ther. 2002 Jul;6(1):135.'],,,,,,,,

Upon subsequent addition to the bound particles of the G protein of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV-G), an efficient surrogate retrovirus envelope protein, the VLP are efficiently taken up by the cells to produce infection. Cell attachment of the VLP is efficiently inhibited by soluble heparin and dextran sulfate and less efficiently abrogated by several other glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) including chondroitin sulfate A and chondroitin sulfate B (dermatan sulfate), as determined by deconvolution microscopic immunodetection of the viral gag protein and by quantitative binding studies of metabolically labeled (35)S-VLP. Enzymatic digestion of heparan sulfate (HS) from the cell surface with heparinase I also reduces VLP binding. Furthermore, VLP adsorption onto several CHO cell lines variably deficient in cell surface GAG is significantly but incompletely abrogated. De-sulfated heparins are less efficient than native heparin in inhibiting the Polybrene-mediated binding of VLP, whereas growth of human cells in the presence of sodium chlorate leads to significant reduction of Polybrene-mediated VLP binding. In addition, specific inhibition of VLP binding and infectivity of mature infectious VSV-G-pseudotyped virus is observed in the presence of heparin and HS under Polybrene-free conditions. We conclude from these studies that the presence of Polybrene, the degree of sulfation of cell surface GAG, and possibly the presence of charged cell surface macromolecules create an electrostatic environment that promotes optimum binding of VLP to cells. Additionally, our results demonstrate that, in the absence of Polybrene, initial attachments of non-infectious, envelope protein-free VLP and probably mature infectious virus particles are mediated by interactions of the virus particles with cell surface heparan sulfate, and possibly with other GAG molecules.","['Guibinga, Ghiabe H', 'Miyanohara, Atsushi', 'Esko, Jeffrey D', 'Friedmann, Theodore']","['Guibinga GH', 'Miyanohara A', 'Esko JD', 'Friedmann T']","['Center for Molecular Genetics and Department of Pediatrics, University of California, San Diego School of Medicine, La Jolla, California, USA.']",['eng'],['R01 HL64730/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Ther,Molecular therapy : the journal of the American Society of Gene Therapy,100890581,"['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Fusion Proteins, gag-pol)', '0 (G protein, vesicular stomatitis virus)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '9050-30-0 (Heparitin Sulfate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell-Free System', 'Culture Media', 'Fusion Proteins, gag-pol/genetics/physiology', 'Genetic Vectors/*administration & dosage', 'HIV-1/*physiology', 'HeLa Cells', 'Heparitin Sulfate/*metabolism', 'Humans', '*Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/classification/genetics/*pathogenicity', 'RNA, Viral/physiology', 'Receptors, Virus/*physiology', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*metabolism', 'Virus Replication']",2002/05/07 10:00,2002/09/13 10:01,['2002/05/07 10:00'],"['2002/05/07 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/13 10:01 [medline]', '2002/05/07 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1006/mthe.2002.0578 [doi]', 'S1525-0016(02)90578-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Mol Ther. 2002 May;5(5 Pt 1):538-46. doi: 10.1006/mthe.2002.0578.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Eighty-six patients with isolated thrombocytopenia (i.e., normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, peripheral smear and clotting studies) were studied. The bone marrow was consistent with ITP in 82 patients, (i.e., normal or increased megakaryocytes and other hemopoietic lineages normal.) Four patients had decreased megakaryocytes, but all patients responded to corticosteroids. All 86 patients were followed up for a median of 22 months after bone marrow aspiration (range, 2-76 months.) During that time, none of the patients developed features to suggest an alternative diagnosis to ITP. The initial clinical and laboratory findings of 99 patients with acute leukemia were also reviewed; all had features atypical of ITP. These data suggest that routine performance of a bone marrow examination for the diagnosis of ITP is not necessary, provided that a thorough history and physical examination are performed and that the complete blood cell count, peripheral blood smear, and routine clotting studies show no abnormalities apart from thrombocytopenia. The findings of seven prior retrospective studies, two in adults and five in children are consistent with the previous findings. However, the value of marrow investigation in ITP remains unresolved and data from a large prospective study would be helpful.","['Jubelirer, Steven J', 'Harpold, Robert']","['Jubelirer SJ', 'Harpold R']","['West Virginia University School of Medicine, Morgantown, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Clin Appl Thromb Hemost,Clinical and applied thrombosis/hemostasis : official journal of the International Academy of Clinical and Applied Thrombosis/Hemostasis,9508125,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Anemia, Aplastic/diagnosis/pathology', 'Autoimmune Diseases/blood/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Biopsy, Needle', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', '*Bone Marrow Examination', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/diagnosis/pathology', 'Male', 'Megakaryocytes/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Platelet Count', 'Purpura, Thrombocytopenic, Idiopathic/blood/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Retrospective Studies']",2002/05/07 10:00,2002/12/20 04:00,['2002/05/07 10:00'],"['2002/05/07 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/20 04:00 [medline]', '2002/05/07 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/107602960200800110 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Appl Thromb Hemost. 2002 Jan;8(1):73-6. doi: 10.1177/107602960200800110.,,,,,,,13,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This GM-CSF hypersensitivity dose-response assay has become a component of the international diagnostic criteria for JMML. The authors report a 2-week-old boy with perinatal human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) infection in whom in vitro bone marrow culture studies suggested the diagnosis of JMML by showing increased spontaneous proliferation, inhibition of this growth by anti-GM-CSF antibodies, and hypersensitivity to GM-CSF. Polymerase chain reaction viral studies from whole blood DNA and the shell vial viral culture assay were both positive for HHV-6. The patient's condition improved with expectant treatment, with an eventual return to normal blood counts and resolution of hepatosplenomegaly. This case of perinatal HHV-6 infection shows that viruses can initially mimic the in vitro culture results found in patients with JMML. It also illustrates that patients suspected of having JMML should be observed if there are no signs of progressive disease and concurrent features suggestive of viral infection.","['Lorenzana, Adonis', 'Lyons, Hernando', 'Sawaf, Hadi', 'Higgins, Martha', 'Carrigan, Donald', 'Emanuel, Peter D']","['Lorenzana A', 'Lyons H', 'Sawaf H', 'Higgins M', 'Carrigan D', 'Emanuel PD']","['Department of Pediatrics, St. John Hospital, Detroit, Michigan 48236, USA. adonis.lorenzana@stjohn.org']",['eng'],"['CA60407/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA80916/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Acute Kidney Injury/etiology', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'DNA, Viral/blood', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Herpesvirus 6, Human/growth & development/*isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Jaundice, Neonatal/complications', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/*diagnosis', 'Male', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Roseolovirus Infections/complications/*diagnosis', 'Virus Cultivation']",2002/05/07 10:00,2002/06/05 10:01,['2002/05/07 10:00'],"['2002/05/07 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/06/05 10:01 [medline]', '2002/05/07 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00043426-200202000-00016 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2002 Feb;24(2):136-41. doi: 10.1097/00043426-200202000-00016.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The authors applied strict methodology and a prospective-longitudinal design that started at diagnosis and extended to a median follow-up of 7 years. This report focuses on the outcome of the last evaluation. Test results were compared with healthy controls and to patients with ALL treated on a previous chemotherapy-only protocol. School achievement was evaluated in patients and their siblings. RESULTS: At the last evaluation, significantly lower test scores in patients compared with controls were found for only 2 of 14 cognitive measures (1 intelligence and 1 attention measure). No great differences were seen between school achievement of patients and siblings. Compared with the previous chemotherapy protocol, a better outcome was seen in the current study group on two measures (one memory and one attention measure). CONCLUSIONS: Children surviving ALL have no major cognitive impairment after chemotherapy, including intrathecal and high-dose intravenous methotrexate. The slightly better outcome in the current group may indicate possible adverse effects of more dexamethasone treatment in the previous group.","['Kingma, Annette', 'Van Dommelen, Rieneke I', 'Mooyaart, Eduard L', 'Wilmink, Jan T', 'Deelman, Betto G', 'Kamps, Willem A']","['Kingma A', 'Van Dommelen RI', 'Mooyaart EL', 'Wilmink JT', 'Deelman BG', 'Kamps WA']","['Department of Pediatrics, University Hospital Groningen, The Netherlands. a.kingma@bkk.azg.nl']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', '957E6438QA (Teniposide)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'UM20QQM95Y (Ifosfamide)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)', 'BFM-86 protocol']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Attention/drug effects', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cognition Disorders/*chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Dexamethasone/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Ifosfamide/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Injections, Spinal', 'Learning Disabilities/chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Netherlands/epidemiology', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/*drug therapy/epidemiology', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Prospective Studies', 'Survivors/*psychology', 'Teniposide/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage/adverse effects']",2002/05/07 10:00,2002/06/05 10:01,['2002/05/07 10:00'],"['2002/05/07 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/06/05 10:01 [medline]', '2002/05/07 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00043426-200202000-00010 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2002 Feb;24(2):106-14. doi: 10.1097/00043426-200202000-00010.,,,,"['J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2002 Feb;24(2):86-7.

Combining histological and immunohistological results, the lymphomas could be differentiated into two low-grade T-cell lymphomas and one high-grade multicentric polymorphic B-cell lymphoma. This corresponds to a 1.4% incidence of lymphomas in our cotton-top tamarin population over a period of 19 years. Although frozen material was not available and virological testing could not be carried out, clinical or histological evidence did not support an aetiological role of Herpes (H.) saimiri, H. ateles, simian T-cell leukaemia virus type 1 (STLV-1) or Epstein-Barr-related herpesvirus in any of these cases.

We reviewed studies that examined the risk of leukaemia among young people near nuclear installations. An excess of leukaemia exists near some nuclear installations, at least for the reprocessing plants at Sellafield and Dounreay and the nuclear power plant Krummel. Nonetheless, the results of multi-site studies invalidate the hypothesis of an increased risk of leukaemia related to nuclear discharge. Up until now, analytic studies have not found an explanation for the leukaemia clusters observed near certain nuclear installations. The hypothesis of an infectious aetiology associated with population mixing has been proposed, but needs to be investigated further. The review illustrates two recent examples in France (La Hague reprocessing plant) and in Germany (Krummel power plant), where controversies developed after reports of increased leukaemia risks. These examples show the importance of recalling the current epidemiological knowledge and of using systematic recording of cases to replace the alleged excesses in a more general framework.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 1985 and 1999, 18 allogeneic bone marrow transplantations were performed in 17 patients with CML at the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto. Median age at diagnosis was 9.5 years (range 3-17). Fourteen patients had disease in the first chronic phase, one had disease in the second chronic phase, and two had disease in the accelerated phase. Preparative regimens varied, with radiation-based protocols used in eight patients. Thirteen donors were related (11 matched, 2 mismatched); four were unrelated (2 matched, 2 mismatched). Patients received T-cell-replete bone marrow a median of 7.5 months (range 2.2-22) from diagnosis. A median of 3.0 x 10(8)/kg nucleated cells was infused (range 1.6-6.7). Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis consisted of cyclosporine and methotrexate in 13 children. cyclosporine in three, and methotrexate in one. RESULTS: Primary graft failure occurred in one patient. Grade 2 acute GVHD or more developed in 11 of the 17 children (64%; grade 2 in 4, grade 3 in 7). Chronic GVHD occurred in 6 of the 16 patients at risk (37.5%; 5 extensive, 1 localized). No patient experienced overt or cytogenetic relapse. There were two deaths (12%): one from acute GVHD and cytomegalovirus pneumonia and the other from chronic GVHD. Probability of 5-year event-free survival was 87 +/- 9%. CONCLUSIONS: These results strongly support the practice of allotransplantation in children with CML, even in the setting of advanced disease and histoincompatibility.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Children with B-precursor ALL who did not achieve initial remission after 4 or 6 weeks of standard three- or four-drug induction chemotherapy were entered on study. Therapy consisted of three doses at weekly intervals of methotrexate 1,000 mg/m2 over 24 hours followed by 6-mercaptopurine 1,000 mg/m2 over 8 hours 20 minutes. Patients achieving a partial remission could receive two additional weekly courses of methotrexate and 6-mercaptopurine. Initially, patients received weekly intrathecal chemotherapy, but the study was amended to include intrathecal therapy only at week 1. RESULTS: Nineteen patients were entered on study. All were evaluable for toxicity and response. There were seven complete remissions, four partial remissions, six patients with no response, and two children with progressive disease, for an overall complete remission rate of 37%. One patient was removed from the study after the second course of methotrexate and 6-mercaptopurine because of renal failure. Two patients had neurologic toxicity resulting in a study amendment. No patients subsequently experienced neurologic toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: Intermediate-dose intravenous methotrexate and intravenous 6-mercaptopurine can induce remission in some patients with ALL who experience initial induction failure. Features predicting complete remission, however, could not be identified.","['Ogden, Angela K', 'Pollock, Brad H', 'Bernstein, Mark L', 'Camitta, Bruce', 'Buchanan, George R']","['Ogden AK', 'Pollock BH', 'Bernstein ML', 'Camitta B', 'Buchanan GR']","['Pharmacia Corporation, Peapack, New Jersey, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,"['E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'Q573I9DVLP (Leucovorin)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Leucovorin/administration & dosage', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/administration & dosage', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Nausea/chemically induced', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Remission Induction', 'Treatment Failure']",2002/05/07 10:00,2002/05/25 10:01,['2002/05/07 10:00'],"['2002/05/07 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/05/25 10:01 [medline]', '2002/05/07 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00043426-200203000-00005 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2002 Mar-Apr;24(3):182-7. doi: 10.1097/00043426-200203000-00005.,,,,['J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2002 Mar-Apr;24(3):172-4.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A subset of patients with newly diagnosed, standard-risk, acute lymphoblastic leukemia enrolled in the Children's Cancer Group (CCG) study CCG-1962 at seven participating institutions gave consent and was enrolled in our pharmacoeconomic analysis study. Societal (transportation, lodging, missed workdays, food, babysitter) and payer (frequency of encounters) cost data were collected from diaries (n = 27). Additional payer costs, such as drug costs, cost per clinic visit, and cost per inpatient day stay were collected from patients in CCG-1962 and participating institutions. We considered costs of therapy, including higher pegaspargase costs when comparing regimens of pegaspargase versus native E. coli L-asparaginase in induction, delayed intensification 1, and delayed intensification 2. RESULTS: Our results showed that the costs of the two therapies were similar from the payer perspective, with pegaspargase costing 1.8% more than E. coli L-asparaginase. The difference between groups also was small (<1%) from the societal perspective. Inpatient stay accounted for 88% of pegaspargase payer costs and 91% of the native E. coli L-asparaginase costs. CONCLUSION: We recommend that pegaspargase not be withheld from treatment protocols solely because of its higher pharmacy costs.","['Kurre, Helen A', 'Ettinger, Alice G', 'Veenstra, David L', 'Gaynon, Paul S', 'Franklin, Janet', 'Sencer, Susan F', 'Reaman, Gregory H', 'Lange, Beverly J', 'Holcenberg, John S']","['Kurre HA', 'Ettinger AG', 'Veenstra DL', 'Gaynon PS', 'Franklin J', 'Sencer SF', 'Reaman GH', 'Lange BJ', 'Holcenberg JS']","[""Clinical Services Administration, Children's Hospital and Regional Medical Center, Seattle, Washington, USA. hkurre@chmc.org""]",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)', '7D96IR0PPM (pegaspargase)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*economics/therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/*economics/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cost Savings/economics', 'Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Drug Costs', 'Economics, Pharmaceutical', 'Escherichia coli/*enzymology', 'Female', 'Health Care Costs', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Polyethylene Glycols/*economics/therapeutic use', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*economics', 'Prospective Studies']",2002/05/07 10:00,2002/05/25 10:01,['2002/05/07 10:00'],"['2002/05/07 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/05/25 10:01 [medline]', '2002/05/07 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00043426-200203000-00004 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2002 Mar-Apr;24(3):175-81. doi: 10.1097/00043426-200203000-00004.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We demonstrated that vratizolin exerted strong immunosuppressive actions both in the humoral and cellular immune response to SRBC in mice. The compound affected not only the inductive phase of delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) but also the effector phase of that response. Vratizolin was effective when given intraperitoneally and orally. The inhibitory action of vratizolin was comparable to that of cyclosporin A (CsA), the reference drug. Vratizolin exhibited also suppressory properties with regard to PHA-induced proliferation of human peripheral blood lymphocytes and that effect exceeded the inhibitory action of CsA. We also showed that vratizolin inhibited to some degree LPS-induced cytokine production in human peripheral blood cultures. The activities of TNF-alpha, IL-1 and IL-6 were inhibited on average by 37, 26 and 35%, respectively. This was in contrast to the effects of CsA which strongly inhibited only IL-1 production. Lastly, we demonstrated that vratizolin markedly inhibited growth of several tumor cell lines. In particular, the compound significantly inhibited growth of mouse leukemia L-1210 and human acute lymphoblastoid leukemia CCRF-CEM cell lines. The presented data suggest that the immunosuppressory action of vratizolin, although similar to that of CsA, is mediated by a different mechanism. The properties of vratizolin, described in this report, indicate that the drug should be further investigated for possible immunosuppressory and antitumor application.","['Machon, Z', 'Wieczorek, Z', 'Zimecki, M']","['Machon Z', 'Wieczorek Z', 'Zimecki M']","['Department of Organic Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, University Medical School, Wroclaw, Poland.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Poland,Pol J Pharmacol,Polish journal of pharmacology,9313882,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', 'W656S9I00W (denotivir)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibody Formation/drug effects', 'Antiviral Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cyclosporine/pharmacology', 'Cytokines/biosynthesis', 'Erythrocytes/cytology/immunology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hypersensitivity, Delayed/drug therapy/immunology', 'Immunity, Cellular/drug effects', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*pharmacology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/cytology/drug effects', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred CBA', 'Sheep', 'Spleen/cytology/immunology', 'Thiazoles/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/05/07 10:00,2002/07/20 10:01,['2002/05/07 10:00'],"['2002/05/07 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/07/20 10:01 [medline]', '2002/05/07 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Pol J Pharmacol. 2001 Jul-Aug;53(4):377-83.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, virtually all these patients have a potential family donor with whom they share one HLA haplotype. METHODS: We report the rationale for making hematopoietic stem cell transplantation from haploidentical related donors feasible, as well as the method followed to achieve this. Two studies are reported, designed to overcome the problem of rejection and graft-versus-host disease after haploidentical stem cell transplantation. We describe how our total body irradiation-based, highly immuno- and myelosuppressive conditioning regimens were developed and how they have been modified over the years in an attempt to improve the clinical outcome of high-risk acute leukemia patients receiving large numbers of extensively T-cell-depleted hematopoietic stem cell transplantations from full-haplotype mismatched family donors. RESULTS: A high engraftment rate and an extremely low incidence of graft-versus-host disease were obtained. Modifications of the pretransplant schedules allowed the reduction of transplant-related toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: The main obstacles that limited the use of haploidentical stem cell transplantation have been overcome. The procedure is now a reality that should be recommended in high-risk acute leukemia patients who do not have a suitable matched donor.","['Aristei, C', 'Latini, P', 'Faicinelli, F', 'Latini, R A', 'Aversa, F']","['Aristei C', 'Latini P', 'Faicinelli F', 'Latini RA', 'Aversa F']","['Institute of Radiotherapy Oncology, Perugia General Hospital and University, Italy. cynaristei@edisons.it']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Tumori,Tumori,0111356,['0 (HLA Antigens)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'HLA Antigens', 'Haplotypes', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/radiotherapy/*surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'T-Lymphocytes', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods', '*Whole-Body Irradiation']",2002/05/07 10:00,2002/05/23 10:01,['2002/05/07 10:00'],"['2002/05/07 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/05/23 10:01 [medline]', '2002/05/07 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Tumori. 2001 Nov-Dec;87(6):402-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN: A postal questionnaire was sent to the general practitioner of the 690 cases born before 1976 and alive in 1991 after at least 5 years from diagnosis. The answer was received for 485 (72.9%) included in the analyses. Items in the questionnaire were: sequelae related to cancer and its treatment, health-related quality of life (according to Bloom's criteria), educational level attained, and employment status. RESULTS: Vital and marital status were obtained for all 690 cases at the offices of the town of residence. No medical condition was reported for 309 cases (63.7%). The overall proportion with a high school or university education was compared to corresponding figures for Piedmont in 1991, adjusted by age, and was as high as in the general population. Similar results are observed for occupation. Patients of both genders were married less than expected. Patients with leukemia (112 cases), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (34) or Hodgkin's lymphoma (52) were reported to have the highest quality of life. In contrast, patients with tumors of the central nervous system (151) had the highest frequency of sequelae and the lowest score for health-related quality of life. They-also presented the lowest educational achievement, the lowest proportion of employment and, among males, the lowest frequency of marriage. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows a good social adjustment of adult survivors from childhood cancer, with the exception of central nervous system tumors. From the methodologic point of view, the present study shows the feasibility of surveillance surveys on health-related quality of life with the contribution of general practitioners.","['Pastore, G', 'Mosso, M L', 'Magnani, C', 'Luzzatto, L', 'Bianchi, M', 'Terracini, B']","['Pastore G', 'Mosso ML', 'Magnani C', 'Luzzatto L', 'Bianchi M', 'Terracini B']","['Childhood Cancer Registry of Piedmont, Cancer Epidemiology Unit of the Centre for Cancer Epidemiology and Prevention, CPO Piedmont, San Giovanni Hospital, Turin, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Tumori,Tumori,0111356,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', '*Educational Status', '*Employment', 'Family Practice/statistics & numerical data', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Female', '*Health Status', 'Humans', 'Italy', 'Male', '*Marital Status', 'Neoplasms/*psychology', '*Population Surveillance', '*Quality of Life', 'Registries', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Survivors/psychology/*statistics & numerical data']",2002/05/07 10:00,2002/05/23 10:01,['2002/05/07 10:00'],"['2002/05/07 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/05/23 10:01 [medline]', '2002/05/07 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Tumori. 2001 Nov-Dec;87(6):372-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We enrolled 1,989 children notified to the Danish Cancer Registry with a diagnosis of leukaemia, tumour of the central nervous system (CNS), or malignant lymphoma during 1968-1991, and 5,506 control children selected at random from the entire childhood population. The residential histories of the children were traced from nine months before birth up to the time of diagnosis, as was a similar period for the controls. Information on traffic and the configuration of streets and buildings was collected for each of the 18,440 identified addresses. Concentrations of benzene and nitrogen dioxide (indicators of traffic-related air pollution) were calculated for the relevant residential periods, and combined into exposures to air pollution during pregnancy and childhood, respectively. RESULTS: The risks of leukaemia, CNS tumours, and all selected cancers combined were not related to exposure to benzene or nitrogen dioxide during either period. The risk of lymphomas increased by 25% (p for trend = 0.06) and 51% (p for trend = 0.05) for a doubling of the concentration of benzene and nitrogen dioxide, respectively, during the pregnancy. The association was restricted to Hodgkin's disease. DISCUSSION: On the basis of a low potential for selection bias, information bias, and confounding factors, we conclude that traffic-related air pollution at the residence of children is not linked to the risk of leukaemia or CNS tumour, which are the two major types of childhood cancer. The results indicated a possible association between air pollution and the risk of Hodgkin's disease, but the evidence allows of no firm conclusion at present.","['Raaschou-Nielsen, Ole', 'Hertel, Ole', 'Thomsen, Birthe L', 'Olsen, Jorgen H']","['Raaschou-Nielsen O', 'Hertel O', 'Thomsen BL', 'Olsen JH']","['Institut for Epidemiologisk Kraeftforskning, Kraeftens Bekaempelse, DK-2100 Kobenhavn.']",['dan'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Denmark,Ugeskr Laeger,Ugeskrift for laeger,0141730,"['0 (Air Pollutants)', '0 (Vehicle Emissions)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)', 'S7G510RUBH (Nitrogen Dioxide)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Air Pollutants/*adverse effects', 'Benzene/adverse effects', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Denmark/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Lymphoma/chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Nitrogen Dioxide/adverse effects', 'Pregnancy', 'Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects', 'Residence Characteristics', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Vehicle Emissions/*adverse effects']",2002/05/07 10:00,2002/05/22 10:01,['2002/05/07 10:00'],"['2002/05/07 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/05/22 10:01 [medline]', '2002/05/07 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Ugeskr Laeger. 2002 Apr 22;164(17):2283-7.,,,,,Luftforurening fra trafik ved boligen og risiko for kraeft hos born.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, until these innovative endeavors prove successful, and in parallel to them we attempted to minimize the gonadotoxic effect of chemotherapy by the co-treatment with a GnRH agonistic analogue to induce a temporary prepubertal milieu. Whereas, inhibin-B concentrations in serum may reflect the ovarian granulosa cell compartment, inhibin-A reflects luteal function. The immunoreactive inhibin-A and -B in these patients, before, during, and following the gonadotoxic chemotherapy were measured. METHODS: A prospective clinical protocol was undertaken in 55 women with lymphoma, aged 15-40 years, ten with leukemia and eight undergoing chemotherapeutic treatments for non malignant diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or other autoimmune diseases. A monthly injection of depot D-TRP6-GnRH-a was administered from before starting the chemotherapy until its conclusion, up to a maximum of 6 months. Hormonal profile (FSH, LH, E2, T, P4, IGF-1, IGF-BP3, and PRL) was taken before starting the GnRH-a/chemotherapy co-treatment, and monthly thereafter, until resuming spontaneous ovulation. This group was compared with a control group of 55 women who have been treated with similar chemotherapy. Inhibin-A and -B immunoactivity was measured by an ELISA commercial kit (Serotec). RESULTS: Whereas, all but three (40- and 36-year-old) of the surviving patients with GnRH-a/chemotherapy co-treatment group resumed spontaneous ovulation and menses within 12 months, less than half of the patients in the control group (chemotherapy without GnRH-a co-treatment) resumed ovarian function and regular cyclic activity (P<0.05). The remaining 56% experienced premature ovarian failure (POF). Temporary increased FSH concentrations were experienced by about a third of the patients resuming cyclic ovarian function, suggesting a reversible ovarian damage in a larger proportion of women than those experiencing POF. Inhibin-A and -B decreased during the GnRH-a/chemotherapy co-treatment but increased to normal levels in patients who resumed regular ovarian cyclicity, and/or spontaneously conceived, as compared with low levels in those who developed POF. CONCLUSIONS: If these preliminary data are consistent in a larger group of patients, inhibin-A or -B concentrations may serve as prognostic factors for predicting the resumption of ovarian function, in addition to the levels of FSH, LH and E2. The GnRH-a co-treatment should be considered in every woman in the reproductive age receiving chemotherapy, in addition to ART, and to the investigational attempts of ovarian cryopreservation for future in-vitro maturation, autotransplantation, or xenotransplantation.","['Blumenfeld, Z']",['Blumenfeld Z'],"['Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility Section, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Rambam Medical Center, Technion-Faculty of Medicine, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, 31096, Haifa, Israel. bzeev@techunix.technion.ac.il']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Ireland,Mol Cell Endocrinol,Molecular and cellular endocrinology,7500844,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (inhibin A)', '0 (inhibin B)', '57285-09-3 (Inhibins)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Biomarkers/blood', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infertility, Female/chemically induced/diagnosis/*prevention & control', 'Inhibins/blood', 'Ovary/drug effects/physiology', 'Primary Ovarian Insufficiency/chemically induced/diagnosis/prevention & control']",2002/05/04 10:00,2003/07/18 05:00,['2002/05/04 10:00'],"['2002/05/04 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/18 05:00 [medline]', '2002/05/04 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0303720701007122 [pii]', '10.1016/s0303-7207(01)00712-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Endocrinol. 2002 Feb 22;187(1-2):93-105. doi: 10.1016/s0303-7207(01)00712-2.,,,,,,,126,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This approach was evaluated by using the beta-actin gene as a reference molecule for measuring of mRNA stability. RESULTS: Human leukemia Nalm-6 and CCRF-CEM cells were treated with various concentrations of Actinomycin D to block transcription and aliquots were removed periodically. Total RNA was isolated and quantified using the RiboGree&ncircledR; fluorescent dye with the VersaFluor Fluorometer System. One &mgr;g of total RNA was reverse transcribed and used as template for the amplification of a region of the beta-actin gene (231 bp). To generate the standard curve, serial ten-fold dilutions of the pBactin-231 vector containing the cDNA amplified fragment were employed, beta-actin mRNAs were quantified by Real-Time RT-PCR using the SYB&RcircledR; Green I fluorogenic dye and data analyzed using the iCycle iQ system software. Using this method, the beta-actin mRNA exhibited a half-life of 6.6 h and 13.5 h in Nalm-6 and CCRF-CEM cells, respectively. The t1/2 value obtained for Nalm-6 is comparable to those estimated from Northern blot studies, using normal human leukocytes (5.5 h). CONCLUSIONS: We have developed a rapid, sensitive, and reliable method based on Real-Time RT-PCR for measuring mRNA half-life. Our results confirm that beta-actin mRNA half-life can be affected by the cellular growth rate.","['Leclerc, Guy J', 'Leclerc, Gilles M', 'Barredo, Julio C']","['Leclerc GJ', 'Leclerc GM', 'Barredo JC']","['Department of Pediatric, Division of Hematology and Oncology, Hollings Cancer Center, Medical University of South Carolina, 86 Jonathan Lucas Street (HCC-306), Charleston, SC, USA. leclergj@musc.edu']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Cancer Cell Int,Cancer cell international,101139795,,,,2002/05/04 10:00,2002/05/04 10:01,['2002/05/04 10:00'],"['2001/11/28 00:00 [received]', '2002/03/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/05/04 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/05/04 10:01 [medline]', '2002/05/04 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1186/1475-2867-2-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Cell Int. 2002 Mar 7;2(1):1. doi: 10.1186/1475-2867-2-1.,,,PMC116431,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The mechanism of action of sulphoraphane includes induction of Phase 2 detoxification enzymes, inhibition of carcinogen-activating Phase 1 enzymes, induction of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest, and anti-inflammation. We have recently found that it was accumulated in mammalian cells by up to several hundred-fold over the extracellular concentration, primarily by conjugation with intracellular GSH. The intracellular accumulation levels of SF can reach millimolar concentrations. The anticarcinogenic activity of SF is at least partly dependent on its accumulation levels in cells. Here we show, however, that the accumulated SF was rapidly exported mainly in the form of GSH conjugate (GS-SF) in cultured human cells. It appeared that to sustain the intracellular accumulation levels required a continuous uptake of SF to offset the rapid export of SF/GS-SF. These findings may have important implications for the development of an effective dosing regimen for SF. Moreover, the export was temperature-sensitive and was inhibited by known inhibitors of membrane pumps, suggesting the involvement of such a pump in exporting accumulated SF/GS-SF. Indeed, studies with human leukemia cells (HL60) with or without overexpression of multidrug resistance associated protein-1(MRP-1) and human myeloma cells (8226) with or without overexpression of P-glycoprotein-1 (Pgp-1) indicated that both MRP-1 and Pgp-1 are involved in the export of intracellular SF/GS-SF.","['Zhang, Yuesheng', 'Callaway, Eileen C']","['Zhang Y', 'Callaway EC']","['Arizona Cancer Center, University of Arizona, 1515 N.

Studies have focused upon detection of PML-RARalpha because, although assays for RARalpha-PML transcripts are more sensitive, they are not applicable to 25% of cases. Among patients receiving standard therapy (ATRA and anthracycline-based chemotherapy), qualitative assays using a nested reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), which typically achieve sensitivities of 1 in 10(4), have been found to provide independent prognostic information suitable for directing an approach to treatment. Detection of PML-RARalpha at the end of consolidation, or subsequent recurrence of PCR positivity, heralds relapse, which may, however, be averted by additional therapy leading to improvements in survival for this ""high-risk"" subgroup of patients. MRD analysis has also proved of value in predicting response to autologous transplant procedures undertaken in second complete remission and in directing the need for additional therapy in the post-transplantation setting. Overall, these studies undertaken within the context of a relatively homogeneous disease entity confirm that MRD monitoring provides independent prognostic information, serving as a valuable model for improving treatment strategy in other molecularly defined subsets of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). Nevertheless, conventional nested RT-PCR assays fail to detect residual disease in a significant proportion of patients who ultimately relapse, which may be a reflection of RNA quality and/or assay sensitivity. Therefore, it is hoped that ""real-time"" quantitative RT-PCR technology (RQ-PCR) which permits quantification of fusion gene transcripts in relation to endogenous control genes will be even more predictive of outcome and achieve greater standardization of MRD detection in the context of large-scale clinical trials.","['Grimwade, David']",['Grimwade D'],"[""Division of Medical and Molecular Genetics, Guy's, King's & St Thomas' School of Medicine, Cancer Genetics Laboratory, 8th Floor, Guy's Tower, Guy's Hospital, London SE1 9RT, UK.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Netherlands,Best Pract Res Clin Haematol,Best practice & research.

These treatment modalities are part of the treatment of common oncological diseases in childhood such as acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, brain tumours, Hodgkins lymphoma and solid tumours outside the central nervous system. Cranial irradiation of a prepubertal child can induce early or even precocious puberty, particularly in girls. Hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism may develop at a later stage. Irradiation of the gonads, as e.g. part of total body irradiation before bone marrow transplantation, will most likely cause gonadal failure and late, incomplete or absent puberty in girls. Many boys will experience a normal pubertal development except for small testes. Alkylating agents given for a variety of childhood cancers, are gonadotoxic. After high doses of these drugs, girls are at great risk of developing ovarian failure, whereas boys will usually go through puberty normally. Many children receive a combination of several treatment modalities, which complicates the prediction of pubertal development. Control and management of children with cancer at risk of having a disturbance of puberty is difficult and requires detailed knowledge of endocrinology as well as oncology.

The tyrosine kinase inhibitor STI571 inhibits the BCR/ABL and ABL kinase activity and consequently inhibits growth of BCR/ABL-positive cells. However, resistance to STI571 has been demonstrated in Ph+ cell lines and in CML patients and can be explained in some cases by point mutations within the ATP-binding pocket or amplification of the bcr/abl gene. In previous investigations using a nu/nu mouse model, the binding of STI571 to elevated levels of the plasmaprotein -1 acid glycoprotein (AGP) was identified as an additional mechanism of resistance to this therapeutic approach. Here we provide data on the expression of AGP in CML patients under therapy with STI571. Patients received 400 or 600 mg STI571 daily and apart from clinical parameters we determined AGP and C-reactive protein (CRP) plasma levels as well as the quantitative expression of both BCR/ABL and AGP mRNA in peripheral blood cells. Our data suggest that despite elevated AGP levels in 52% of our patients, no upfront resistance against STI571 was present. In conclusion, we demonstrated that during the first 13 weeks of STI571 therapy (i) plasma AGP levels in CML patients correlate with white blood cell count and stage of disease; (ii) patients with elevated AGP responded less rapidly to STI571; (iii) elevated AGP and CRP levels normalized in patients during treatment with STI571, although mRNA levels of AGP remained stable; (iv) initially normal levels of AGP remained in the normal range during treatment with STI571, indicating that STI571 does not trigger AGP expression in humans; and (v) in relapsed patients, elevation of AGP levels is present prior to hematological progress.","['le Coutre, Philipp', 'Kreuzer, Karl-Anton', 'Na, Il-Kang', 'Lupberger, Joachim', 'Holdhoff, Matthias', 'Appelt, Christine', 'Schwarz, Michaela', 'Muller, Christian', 'Gambacorti-Passerini, Carlo', 'Platzbecker, Uwe', 'Bonnet, Ragnhild', 'Ehninger, Gerhard', 'Schmidt, Christian A']","['le Coutre P', 'Kreuzer KA', 'Na IK', 'Lupberger J', 'Holdhoff M', 'Appelt C', 'Schwarz M', 'Muller C', 'Gambacorti-Passerini C', 'Platzbecker U', 'Bonnet R', 'Ehninger G', 'Schmidt CA']","['Abteilung fur Hamatologie und Onkologie, Campus Virchow, Charite, Humboldt Universitat, Berlin, Germany. lecoutrep@aol.com']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood Cells Mol Dis,"Blood cells, molecules & diseases",9509932,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Orosomucoid)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Benzamides', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/blood', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Orosomucoid/genetics/*metabolism', 'Piperazines/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Prognosis', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/blood', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/05/04 10:00,2003/06/19 05:00,['2002/05/04 10:00'],"['2002/05/04 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/19 05:00 [medline]', '2002/05/04 10:00 [entrez]']","['S1079979602904936 [pii]', '10.1006/bcmd.2002.0493 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Cells Mol Dis. 2002 Jan-Feb;28(1):75-85. doi: 10.1006/bcmd.2002.0493.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MTAP converts methylthioadenosine into adenine which serves as an alternative purine source, if de novo purine biosynthesis is inhibited by antimetabolites (i.e., methotrexate). The idea of the chemoselectivity concept is that tumors with MTAP deletion at chromosome 9p21 are more susceptible to antimetabolites than normal cells without such a deletion. First, we screened 13 T-ALL lines for 9p21 deletions by comparative genomic hybridization. Five cell lines revealed deletions at the short arm of chromosome 9, dim(9p21pter). Further analyses were performed with CEM cells in which the 9p21 deletion was corroborated by fluorescence in situ hybridization. CEM cells were transfected with an MTAP expression vector. A green fluorescent protein (GFP) plasmid was cotransfected, to monitor the transfection efficacy by flow cytometry. The response of MTAP-transfected cells to the antimetabolites methotrexate (MTX), trimetrexate (TMX), and L-alanosine (ALA) was decreased compared to mock control transfectants using growth inhibition assays. The activity of doxorubicin (DOX) which is not involved in DNA biosynthesis was not changed in MTAP transfectants. As the p16(INK4a) tumor suppressor gene resides also at 9p21, we transfected CEM cells with a p16(INK4a) expression vector. These transfectant cells were more resistant to all four drugs indicating that p16(INK4a) did not specifically affect antimetabolites. The chemoselective effect of antimetabolites in MTAP-deleted tumor cells may, however, be compensated by the development of drug resistance. To prove this possibility, we analyzed an MTX-resistant subline, CEM/MTX1500LV, in which the MTX-resistance conferring dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) gene was amplified. While TMX exhibited considerable cross-resistance in CEM/MTX1500LV cells, ALA did not. Thus, ALA could exhibit chemoselectivity in 9p21/MTAP-deleted cells, even if DHFR amplification occurs. We conclude that ALA may be more suitable than MTX or TMX for MTAP-mediated chemoselective treatment of T-ALL. Pretherapeutical detection of 9p21 and MTAP deletion may be helpful in developing a predictive molecular chemosensitivity test for T-ALL.","['Efferth, Thomas', 'Miyachi, Hayato', 'Drexler, Hans Gunther', 'Gebhart, Erich']","['Efferth T', 'Miyachi H', 'Drexler HG', 'Gebhart E']","['Virtual Campus Rhineland-Palatinate, Mainz, Germany. efferth@vcrp.de']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Blood Cells Mol Dis,"Blood cells, molecules & diseases",9509932,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '2CNI71214Y (alanosine)', 'EC 2.4.2.1 (Purine-Nucleoside Phosphorylase)', ""EC 2.4.2.28 (5'-methylthioadenosine phosphorylase)"", 'OF5P57N2ZX (Alanine)', 'UPN4ITI8T4 (Trimetrexate)']",IM,"['Alanine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16/genetics/physiology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*drug therapy/enzymology/pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics', 'Purine-Nucleoside Phosphorylase/*genetics/physiology', 'Transfection', 'Trimetrexate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/05/04 10:00,2003/06/19 05:00,['2002/05/04 10:00'],"['2002/05/04 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/19 05:00 [medline]', '2002/05/04 10:00 [entrez]']","['S1079979602904833 [pii]', '10.1006/bcmd.2002.0483 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Cells Mol Dis. 2002 Jan-Feb;28(1):47-56. doi: 10.1006/bcmd.2002.0483.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
