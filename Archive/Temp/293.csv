Cells from relapsed patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) were significantly more resistant to vincristine, dexamethasone, and doxorubicin in the assay than were cells from previously untreated patients. The putative C kinase inhibitors verapamil (V), imipramine (I), lidocaine (L), tamoxifen (T), chlorpromazine (C), and haloperidol (H) were then tested singly, in combination with each other (VILTCH, ITCH, and VL), and in combination with vincristine. At concentrations judged to be clinically achievable, VILTCH itself was occasionally toxic to ALL and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The VILTCH combination clearly potentiated the cytotoxic activity of vincristine in five of eight ALL specimens from relapsed patients and potentiated vincristine in 18 of 30 chronic lymphocytic leukemia specimens. It also potentiated vincristine in two of six specimens of multiple myeloma and five of six specimens of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The VILTCH combination had no significant effects in fresh cultures of normal human lymphocytes. The most active drugs in the VILTCH combination appeared to be verapamil and lidocaine. We conclude that the differential staining cytotoxicity assay is a useful tool to study the circumvention of clinically acquired drug resistance. While the mechanism of the observed enhancement of the cytotoxic effects of vincristine is not known, it is possible that combinations of putative C kinase inhibitors may reduce drug resistance in human lymphatic neoplasms.","['Weisenthal, L M', 'Su, Y Z', 'Duarte, T E', 'Dill, P L', 'Nagourney, R A']","['Weisenthal LM', 'Su YZ', 'Duarte TE', 'Dill PL', 'Nagourney RA']","['Veterans Administration Medical Center, Long Beach, CA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Treat Rep,Cancer treatment reports,7607107,"['094ZI81Y45 (Tamoxifen)', '98PI200987 (Lidocaine)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'J6292F8L3D (Haloperidol)', 'OGG85SX4E4 (Imipramine)', 'U42B7VYA4P (Chlorpromazine)']",IM,"['Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Chlorpromazine/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance/drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Haloperidol/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Imipramine/pharmacology', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/drug therapy', 'Lidocaine/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase C/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Tamoxifen/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*drug effects', 'Verapamil/pharmacology']",1987/12/01 00:00,1987/12/01 00:01,['1987/12/01 00:00'],"['1987/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Treat Rep. 1987 Dec;71(12):1239-43.,['CA-43432/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,

All but one had received prophylactic cranial irradiation (1800-2400 cGy) and three children had received additional cranial or craniospinal irradiation as treatment for relapse of their leukaemia. Mean age for the onset of puberty was 8.8 (SD 0.8) years in the girls and 9.3 (0.8) years in the boys; this is greater than two standard deviations from the mean for normal girls and boys. Five children (three girls, two boys) had precocious puberty. The onset of puberty occurred at greater than two standard deviations from the mean for normal girls and boys in 14(13%) girls and 4(3%) boys treated at less than eight years of age between 1970 and 1985. In a group of 55 girls treated for ALL who had survived in first remission for six years or more from diagnosis, there was a relation between young age at onset of treatment and early menarche. We suggest that premature activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis occurs as a consequence of hypothalamic dysfunction due to cranial irradiation. Precocious and premature puberty in children treated for ALL may be an important factor in contributing to short stature.","['Leiper, A D', 'Stanhope, R', 'Kitching, P', 'Chessells, J M']","['Leiper AD', 'Stanhope R', 'Kitching P', 'Chessells JM']","['Department of Haematology and Oncology, Hospital for Sick Children, London.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Arch Dis Child,Archives of disease in childhood,0372434,,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Body Height', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*radiotherapy', 'Male', 'Puberty, Precocious/*etiology', 'Radiotherapy/*adverse effects', 'Radiotherapy Dosage']",1987/11/01 00:00,1987/11/01 00:01,['1987/11/01 00:00'],"['1987/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Arch Dis Child. 1987 Nov;62(11):1107-12. doi: 10.1136/adc.62.11.1107.,,['10.1136/adc.62.11.1107 [doi]'],,PMC1778544,,,,

Bone marrow aspirates from 16 cases of apparent acute promyelocytic leukemia, 4 cases of acute agranulocytosis, and 1 case of a marked myeloid left shift were studied for the presence or absence of differentiating features. Normal or reactive promyelocytes were characterized by prominent paranuclear clear Golgi zones, whereas promyelocytes from true leukemic cases all had heavy azurophilic granules dispersed diffusely throughout the cytoplasm. Prominent Golgi zones in promyelocytes were associated only with benign myeloid conditions and were not observed in acute promyelocytic leukemia.

A cDNA library in plasmids is then released by homologous recombination between the retroviral long terminal repeats. Retroviral transduction is achieved by transient expression of the released library in a cell line containing a packaging mutant of Moloney murine leukemia virus, followed by cocultivation of these producers with recipient cells. Transcription of cDNAs in the recipient cells is driven by the strong long terminal repeat promoter, and the transcripts, even from truncated cDNAs, can be expressed because translational start sites have been provided in all three reading frames (tri-initiator).

Steady-state expression of the A-chain RNA was seen only in the promonocytic leukemia cell line U937 and in the T-cell leukemia cell line MOLT-4. It has previously been reported that both PDGF A and PDGF B genes are induced during megakaryoblastic differentiation of the K562 erythroleukemia cells and transiently during monocytic differentiation of the promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL-60 and U937 cells. In this study we show that PDGF A RNA expression was induced in HL-60 and Jurkat T-cell leukemia cells and increased in U937 and MOLT-4 cells after a 1- to 2-h stimulation with an 8 pM concentration of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta). PDGF A RNA remained at a constant, elevated level for at least 24 h in U937 cells, but returned to undetectable levels within 12 h in HL-60 cells. No PDGF A expression was induced by TGF-beta in K562 cells or in lung carcinoma cells (A549). Interestingly, essentially no PDGF B-chain (c-sis proto-oncogene) RNA was expressed simultaneously with PDGF A. In the presence of TGF-beta and protein synthesis inhibitors, PDGF A RNA was superinduced at least 20-fold in the U937 and HL-60 cells. PDGF A expression was accompanied by secretion of immunoprecipitable PDGF to the culture medium of HL-60 and U937 cells. The phorbol ester tumor promoter tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate also increased PDGF A expression with similar kinetics, but with a mechanism distinct from that of TGF-beta. These results suggest a role for TGF-beta in the differential regulation of expression of the PDGF genes.","['Makela, T P', 'Alitalo, R', 'Paulsson, Y', 'Westermark, B', 'Heldin, C H', 'Alitalo, K']","['Makela TP', 'Alitalo R', 'Paulsson Y', 'Westermark B', 'Heldin CH', 'Alitalo K']","['Department of Virology, University of Helsinki, Finland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Phorbol Esters)', '0 (Platelet-Derived Growth Factor)', '0 (Protein Synthesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '76057-06-2 (Transforming Growth Factors)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Peptides/*pharmacology', 'Phorbol Esters/*pharmacology', 'Platelet-Derived Growth Factor/*genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Synthesis Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Time Factors', 'Transforming Growth Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*physiology']",1987/10/01 00:00,1987/10/01 00:01,['1987/10/01 00:00'],"['1987/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1987 Oct;7(10):3656-62. doi: 10.1128/mcb.7.10.3656-3662.1987.,,['10.1128/mcb.7.10.3656-3662.1987 [doi]'],,PMC368020,,,,

During the early stages of HGPRT-deficient HL-60 cell differentiation induced by 6-thioguanine, there was a transient decrease in the queuine content of tRNA, and changes in the isoacceptor profiles of tRNA(His) indicate that 6-thioguanine was incorporated into the tRNA in place of queuine. Reversing this structural change in the tRNA anticodon by addition of excess exogenous queuine reversed the 6-thioguanine-induced growth inhibition and differentiation. Similar results were obtained when 8-azaguanine (another inhibitor of queuine modification of tRNA that can be incorporated into the anticodon) replaced 6-thioguanine as the inducing agent. The data suggest a primary role for the change in queuine modification of tRNA in mediating the differentiation of HGPRT-deficient HL-60 cells induced by guanine analogs.","['Kretz, K A', 'Katze, J R', 'Trewyn, R W']","['Kretz KA', 'Katze JR', 'Trewyn RW']","['Comprehensive Cancer Centre, Ohio State University, Columbus 43210.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '298-83-9 (Nitroblue Tetrazolium)', '5Z93L87A1R (Guanine)', '72496-59-4 (queuine)', '9014-25-9 (RNA, Transfer)', 'EC 2.4.2.8 (Hypoxanthine Phosphoribosyltransferase)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)', 'Q150359I72 (Azaguanine)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, Differentiation/analysis', 'Azaguanine/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Guanine/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hypoxanthine Phosphoribosyltransferase/deficiency', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Nitroblue Tetrazolium', 'RNA Processing, Post-Transcriptional/*drug effects', 'RNA, Transfer/*metabolism', 'Thioguanine/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*cytology']",1987/10/01 00:00,1987/10/01 00:01,['1987/10/01 00:00'],"['1987/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1987 Oct;7(10):3613-9. doi: 10.1128/mcb.7.10.3613-3619.1987.,"['CA-20919/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30-CA-16058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA-09498-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['10.1128/mcb.7.10.3613-3619.1987 [doi]'],,PMC368015,,,,

Purified human heart and liver ferritins were labeled with iodine 125 and incubated with K562 cells at 37 degrees C. Specific uptake was calculated from the reduction in labeled ferritin binding in the presence of a 1000-fold excess of unlabeled ferritin. Specific uptake of 125I-labeled heart ferritin increased progressively, reaching a maximum after 2 to 3 hours' incubation, although nonspecific binding was too high to derive an affinity constant. There was no specific binding with 125I-labeled liver ferritin, and K562 cells bound neither 125I-labeled human serum albumin nor free 125I. Uptake of heart ferritin was negligible at 4 degrees C and was sharply reduced in the presence of 10% human plasma or fetal calf serum. There was no apparent relationship between the number of days of subculture and the level of uptake of acidic isoferritins by whole cells. These studies demonstrate a selective binding mechanism for acidic isoferritins on erythroleukemia cells and imply that these isoferritins have additional functions besides the storage of iron.","['Covell, A M', 'Einspahr, D E', 'Skikne, B S', 'Cook, J D']","['Covell AM', 'Einspahr DE', 'Skikne BS', 'Cook JD']","['Department of Medicine, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City 66103.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Lab Clin Med,The Journal of laboratory and clinical medicine,0375375,['9007-73-2 (Ferritins)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival', 'Ferritins/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Isoelectric Focusing', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Liver/analysis', 'Myocardium/analysis', 'Time Factors']",1987/12/01 00:00,1987/12/01 00:01,['1987/12/01 00:00'],"['1987/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Lab Clin Med. 1987 Dec;110(6):784-90.,,['0022-2143(87)90477-X [pii]'],,,,,,

Both GPIIb and GPIIIa are synthesized by a human erythroleukemia (HEL) cell line. We isolated several cDNA clones by screening a HEL cell cDNA library with an oligonucleotide derived from amino acid sequence of GPIIb. Nucleotide and amino acid sequences were determined from 703 bp of one of these clones. Amino acid sequence of purified platelet GPIIb peptides confirmed the identity of the clone. The cDNA encodes the carboxyl terminus of the large (alpha) subunit of GPIIb and all of the smaller (beta) subunit of GPIIb. By hybridizing the cDNA directly to chromosomes separated by dual laser chromosome sorting, the gene for GPIIb was mapped to chromosome 17. Northern blot analysis showed a approximately 3.4-kb GPIIb mRNA in HEL cells. We also compared the amino acid sequences determined from eight additional platelet GPIIb peptides with the derived amino acids from a published HEL cell GPIIb cDNA, and the platelet and HEL cell proteins appear to be the same. Despite previous reports that vascular endothelial cells and monocytes contain GPIIb, no GPIIb mRNA was observed in either type of cell.

S., Sahyoun, N., Jacobs, S., Wolf, M., and Cuatrecasas, P. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 9419-9426). Recently we reported that the potent tumor-promoting agent phorbol diester or a synthetic diacylglycerol could mediate rapid down-regulation of the surface transferrin receptor in association with receptor phosphorylation in HL60 leukemic cells and suggested that this phosphorylation may provide a signal for receptor internalization. In this communication we have tested experimentally the predictions generated by the hypothesis that receptor phosphorylation may play such a role in the intracellular cycling of the transferrin receptor. Results indicate that phorbol diester-stimulated phosphorylation occurs stoichiometrically only on the surface-oriented receptor and precedes internalization. Using a specific inhibitor of protein kinase C, it was found that both phorbol diester-mediated receptor phosphorylation and down-regulation could be antagonized. While the mechanism of internalization of the phosphorylated receptor is not clear, phorbol diester treatment significantly increases the rate constant for endocytosis from 0.183 to 0.462 min-1, while inhibiting only slightly the rate constant for exocytosis of the internalized receptor from 0.113 to 0.079 min-1. Thus, we conclude that phorbol diester treatment affects intracellular cycling of receptors and establishes a new steady state distribution of surface and intracellular receptors. These data support a role for receptor phosphorylation as a trigger for internalization primarily by stimulating the process of transferrin receptor endocytosis while affecting the subsequent exocytosis of the receptor cycling only slightly.","['May, W S', 'Tyler, G']","['May WS', 'Tyler G']","['Johns Hopkin Oncology Center, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland 21205.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Isoquinolines)', '0 (Phorbol Esters)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', '37558-16-0 (Phorbol 12,13-Dibutyrate)', '84477-87-2 (1-(5-Isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-Methylpiperazine)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)']",IM,"['1-(5-Isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-Methylpiperazine', 'Cell Line', 'Exocytosis/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Isoquinolines/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism', 'Mathematics', 'Phorbol 12,13-Dibutyrate', 'Phorbol Esters/pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase C/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Receptors, Transferrin/*metabolism']",1987/12/05 00:00,1987/12/05 00:01,['1987/12/05 00:00'],"['1987/12/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/12/05 00:01 [medline]', '1987/12/05 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1987 Dec 5;262(34):16710-8.,"['CA06973/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA37903/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['S0021-9258(18)49313-1 [pii]'],,,,,,

Whereas cells that were morphologically primitive and cytochemically leukemic persisted in leukemic suspension culture, they were progressively and completely replaced in long-term bone marrow culture by neutrophilic granulocytes and subsequently by macrophages. However, Auer rods were present in the maturing myeloid cells, including polymorphonuclear neutrophils, between the 7th and 30th days of long-term bone marrow culture, indicating that they were derived directly from the original leukemic population.

To characterize the various patterns of changes that occur during differentiation, cDNA libraries made from RNA isolated from uninduced and differentiating cells were screened with labeled cDNA or RNA labeled in vivo for different periods of time. cDNA clones that corresponded to individual mRNAs whose level remained constant, increased, or decreased during differentiation were identified. These clones were used to analyze Northern blots containing RNA from uninduced and differentiated cells. A number of characteristic changes in individual mRNAs in differentiating murine erythroleukemia cells could be identified, such as no change, increase in concentration, increase in concentration and slight change in size, decrease in concentration, decrease in concentration and change in size, appearance of new band(s) of entirely different size, and change in relative concentrations of two related mRNAs. Measurements of rates of mRNA synthesis and degradation suggest that both parameters change during differentiation and that these changes are instrumental in establishing cellular concentration of specific mRNAs. It seems that the changes in mRNA stability observed in differentiating murine erythroleukemia cells may be associated with changes in the primary structure of the transcribed portion of mRNA. The observation that specific mRNA synthesized before and after induction may have very different stabilities at the same point in differentiation supports this hypothesis.","['Volloch, V', 'Schweitzer, B', 'Rits, S']","['Volloch V', 'Schweitzer B', 'Rits S']","['Department of Metabolic Regulation, Boston Biomedical Research Institute, Massachusetts 02114.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Nucleus/physiology', 'DNA/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/genetics/*pathology', 'Mice', 'RNA, Messenger/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*pathology/physiology']",1987/11/01 00:00,1987/11/01 00:01,['1987/11/01 00:00'],"['1987/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 1987 Nov;173(1):38-48. doi: 10.1016/0014-4827(87)90329-6.,['R01-CA33953/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['0014-4827(87)90329-6 [pii]', '10.1016/0014-4827(87)90329-6 [doi]']",,,,,,

The peak plasma concentration of ara-C ranged from 0.02 to 5.6 microM after the first dose of ara-C. The area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) of ara-C in plasma ranged from 302 to 20,298 microMh after the first dose of ara-C. The half-life of elimination (t1/2,el) of ara-C from plasma was 2.4 +/- 1.5 h in three patients with acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia (ANLL) and 4.78 +/- 4.1 h in 9 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The intracellular peak concentration of ara-CTP in circulating blast cells averaged 432.2 +/- 14.5 microM and 544.3 +/- 330 microM in patients with ANLL and ALL, respectively. The elimination kinetics of ara-CTP was monoexponential with t1/2,el of 3.30 +/- 0.8 h and 6.9 +/- 2.8 h in patients with ANLL and ALL. DNA synthetic capacity (DSC) of the blast cells was inhibited to between 24 and 64% of control after the first dose of ara-C and it declined further to between 1 and 32% after four doses of ara-C. The AUC of ara-CTP in leukemic cells ranged from 1,073 to 14,751 microMh and it was not related to the AUC of ara-C in plasma. The pharmacodynamic parameters of ara-CTP in circulating blast cells were more homogeneous in patients with ANLL than in patients with ALL. Four of six patients (67%) with ANLL and six of 14 patients (43%) with ALL achieved either complete remission or partial remission with high dose ara-C. We conclude that treatment of pediatric patients with leukemia in relapse with high dose ara-C is tolerable and moderately successful. Inhibition of DSC is positively correlated with the probability of having zero nadir peripheral blast cells. In turn there is a trend for a zero nadir peripheral blast cell count to be related to achievement of a response to therapy. This latter result is consistent with the results of larger studies in adults with leukemia.","['Avramis, V I', 'Biener, R', 'Krailo, M', 'Finklestein, J', 'Ettinger, L', 'Willoughby, M', 'Siegel, S E', 'Holcenberg, J S']","['Avramis VI', 'Biener R', 'Krailo M', 'Finklestein J', 'Ettinger L', 'Willoughby M', 'Siegel SE', 'Holcenberg JS']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology, Childrens Hospital of Los Angeles, California 90027.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '13191-15-6 (Arabinofuranosylcytosine Triphosphate)']",IM,"['Arabinofuranosylcytosine Triphosphate/blood', 'Child', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics', 'Half-Life', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/blood/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/blood/drug therapy', 'Neutropenia/chemically induced']",1987/12/15 00:00,1987/12/15 00:01,['1987/12/15 00:00'],"['1987/12/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/12/15 00:01 [medline]', '1987/12/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1987 Dec 15;47(24 Pt 1):6786-92.,['R01 CA38905/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,

Philadelphia chromosome-positive (and many Ph1-negative) chronic myelogenous leukemia cells transcribe a novel bcr-abl fusion mRNA which may confer a growth advantage upon these cells. We investigated the effect of IFN alpha 2 on the levels of bcr-abl transcript expression in three Ph1-positive CML cell lines, EM2, KCL22, and K562. Although IFN alpha 2 inhibited cell proliferation in all three CML cell lines, IFN alpha 2 had no effect on the level of bcr-abl mRNA expression in any of the CML cell lines. In contrast, IFN alpha 2 increased the expression of class I HLA gene products. We conclude that while the bcr-abl fusion gene and its transcript undoubtedly play key roles in the pathogenesis of CML, the antiproliferative effect of IFN alpha 2 in CML cell lines relies upon genetic mechanisms other than modulation of bcr-abl expression.","['Andrews, D F 3rd', 'Singer, J W', 'Collins, S J']","['Andrews DF 3rd', 'Singer JW', 'Collins SJ']","['Department of Medicine, Veterans Administration Medical Center, Seattle, Washington 98108.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,"['Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects', 'Genes, MHC Class I/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interferon Type I/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'RNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1987/12/15 00:00,1987/12/15 00:01,['1987/12/15 00:00'],"['1987/12/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/12/15 00:01 [medline]', '1987/12/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1987 Dec 15;47(24 Pt 1):6629-32.,"['CA16448/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA18029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA40723/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,

However, the measurement of ara-C incorporation into leukemic cell DNA in vivo during ara-C therapy has been limited by the lack of a suitably sensitive method. A quantitative assay procedure has therefore been developed to determine incorporation of unlabeled ara-C into DNA. This method involves DNA isolation from patient myeloblasts, enzymatic digestion of the DNA, high pressure liquid chromatography separation of the nucleosides, and determination of ara-C in the eluate fractions by radioimmunoassay. Using this approach, incorporation of unlabeled ara-C into DNA of HL-60 cells is log linear over concentrations of 1 to 100 microM ara-C. Furthermore, the extent of ara-C incorporation into DNA as determined by this method correlates significantly with measurements of [3H]ara-C (DNA) formation under similar conditions. This approach has also been applied to clinical samples. Myeloblasts from 6 patients receiving high-dose continuous-infusion ara-C therapy incorporated 0.00-0.36 pmol ara-C/microgram DNA during 24 h of therapy. These findings thus suggest that this method can be used to monitor the in vivo incorporation of ara-C into leukemic cell DNA.","['Spriggs, D', 'Robbins, G', 'Ohno, Y', 'Kufe, D']","['Spriggs D', 'Robbins G', 'Ohno Y', 'Kufe D']","['Laboratory of Clinical Pharmacology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Cytarabine/*analysis', 'DNA/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Radioimmunoassay', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/metabolism']",1987/12/15 00:00,1987/12/15 00:01,['1987/12/15 00:00'],"['1987/12/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/12/15 00:01 [medline]', '1987/12/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1987 Dec 15;47(24 Pt 1):6532-6.,"['CA 29431/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K08CA00994/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,

TPA also caused a similar down-regulation and translocation of PK-C in KG-1a, a cloned subline shown to be resistant to the differentiating effect of TPA. The activity levels of enzyme in the soluble and particulate fractions from KG-1 cells, however, were about three times higher than those from KG-1a cells. Immunocytochemical studies showed that, when KG-1 cells were treated with 10 nM TPA for 30 min, PK-C was translocated to the plasma membrane in the adherent subpopulation of cells, whereas the enzyme remained largely in the cytoplasm and perinuclear area of the nonadherent cells. TPA, in contrast, caused a PK-C translocation primarily to the perinuclear region in KG-1a cells. Phosphorylation patterns of PK-C substrate proteins in the two cell lines were similar, except that phosphorylation of the Mr 33,000 and 97,000 proteins were predominant in KG-1 and KG-1a cells, respectively.

The induction of HL-60 leukemia cell maturation by 6-MMPR was preceded by a marked reduction in the incorporation of [3H]mannose into glycoproteins and into the dolichol-oligosaccharide precursors of N-linked glycoprotein biosynthesis. Simultaneous exposure of HL-60 cells to 6-MMPR and adenine completely prevented the reduction in [3H]mannose incorporation into glycoproteins produced by the purine nucleoside antimetabolite.

Associations with hyperleukocytosis and acute monocytic leukemia.,3071-9,"There were 294 children with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) entered into the German AML Berlin, Frankfurt, and Munster hospitals (BFM) 78 and 83 studies. Thirty (10%) died as a result of hemorrhage and/or leukostasis prior to or in the first 12 days of therapy. The risk of early death due to hemorrhage and/or leukostasis is significantly greater when certain features are initially present: acute monocytic leukemia (French-American-British [FAB] M5), hyperleukocytosis (greater than or equal to 100,000/microliter), and extramedullary organ involvement (P less than 0.001). The risk increases sharply when these factors exist in combination: 72% mortality with FAB M5 and hyperleukocytosis, and 43% with FAB M5 and extramedullary organ involvement. In 11 patients leukostasis alone or in combination with hemorrhage was probably the cause of death during the first 3 days after diagnosis. All 11 children presented with hyperleukocytosis and were classified as monocytic subtype FAB M4 or M5. After induction, a close temporal association between rapid blast reduction and occurrence of fatal hemorrhage was established in five patients.

The linear regression analysis of dose-steady state concentration relationship revealed that relapsed children had significantly lower steady state concentration of MTX (faster systemic clearance) than those who remained in continuous complete remission (CCR), whatever dosage of the drug was given. Relapsed children (n = 25) had a systemic clearance of MTX 122.5 +/- 55.5 ml/minute/m2 versus 71.8 +/- 25.8 ml/minute/m2 found in the CCR patients (n = 33) when the dosage of MTX was 0.5 to 1.0 g/m2. When the dose was 6.0 to 8.0 g/m2 the clearance values were 93.27 +/- 32.6 versus 61.8 +/- 24.5 ml/minute/m2, respectively. The differences are statistically significant (P less than 0.001). In 16 of 25 relapsed patients (64%) an increase of the systemic clearance has been observed during the consecutive treatments, but only 4/33 CCR patients (12%) has expressed such a phenomenon.

Circumscript lesions of the epiphyses were seen exclusively in the four patients with clinical suspicion of osteonecrosis during BM remission and this may be a MR finding strongly indicative of osteonecrosis.

For chronic granulocytic leukaemia (CGL), these patterns were so reproducible and distinct that they allowed an immediate diagnosis even without the benefit of microscopic examination. Relative and absolute basophilia was an invariable feature, and remained detected by the H-6000 even when the patient was in haematologic and cytogenetic remission or progressed into blast crisis (BC). Most patients in BC also demonstrated an inordinately high number of large unstained cells (LUC) and high proportions of 'lymphocytes' (small blasts with no peroxidase content by visual inspection). Thus, for patients with CGL, LUC values above 10%, and/or steady increments in the proportion of 'lymphocytes', merit concern as these changes may herald an accelerated phase of disease. The scattergram pattern of untreated chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) showed a dense accumulation of data points within the lymphocytic 'box' with a small cluster of granulocytic elements. Most patients also had a frankly abnormal proportion of LUC. Sixteen patients with CLL were compared for ratios of LUC to lymphocytes and stage of disease; patients with the most advanced stage (IV) had the highest, statistically significant values, than the patients with more benign disease. Thus, it is possible that follow up with this instrument of patients with CLL will also allow early detection of an impending prolymphocytoid transformation (accelerated phase) of this disease.","['Drewinko, B', 'Bollinger, P', 'Brailas, C', 'Wyatt, J', 'Simson, E', 'Trujillo, J M']","['Drewinko B', 'Bollinger P', 'Brailas C', 'Wyatt J', 'Simson E', 'Trujillo JM']","['Division of Laboratory Medicine, University of Texas System Cancer Center, M.D. Anderson Hospital and Tumor Institute at Houston 77030.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,IM,"['Cell Separation', '*Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*blood', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*blood', 'Leukocyte Count', '*Lymphocytes']",1987/10/01 00:00,1987/10/01 00:01,['1987/10/01 00:00'],"['1987/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1987 Oct;67(2):157-65. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1987.tb02320.x.,,['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1987.tb02320.x [doi]'],,,,,,

The induction of radiation-induced damage, as measured by filter elution at pH 12.1, 9.6, and 7.2, was similar in the resistant strain LY-R and the sensitive strain LY-S. The repair of single-strand breaks and alkali-labile sites, as measured by filter elution at pH 12.1 at various times after irradiation, was somewhat slower in strain LY-S than in strain LY-R, although after a 20-min repair period the extent of repair was equal in the two strains. However, when filter elution was performed at either pH 9.6 or pH 7.2, the repair of x-radiation-induced damage was much less extensive in strain LY-S than in strain LY-R. We have assumed that the extent of filter elution at pH 9.6 is a measure of the occurrence of frank double-strand breaks as well as closely opposing single-strand breaks and pH 9.6-labile sites (and combinations thereof), and that the extent of elution at pH 7.2 is a measure of the occurrence of frank double-strand breaks alone. If these assumptions are correct, the results suggest that the sensitivity of strain LY-S to the cytotoxic effects of ionizing radiation is caused by a deficiency in the ability of this strain to repair frank double-strand breaks and pH 9.6-labile lesions. The repair of pH 9.6-labile lesions was temperature sensitive in strain LY-S, as previously found for cellular recovery processes in this strain. Two independent radiation-resistant variants of strain LY-S, isolated after protracted exposure of LY-S cells to low-dose-rate radiation, showed a deficiency in the repair of pH 9.6-labile lesions similar to that observed in strain LY-S. However, the repair of frank double-strand breaks was more extensive in the radiation-resistant variants than in strain LY-S and was similar in extent to that occurring in strain LY-R after a 60-min postirradiation incubation. The results suggest that there is a difference in the nature of DNA damage measured by filter elution at pH 9.6 vs. pH 7.2 and that a deficiency in the repair of pH 9.6-labile lesions does not contribute to cell lethality in the case of the radiation-resistant variants. The radiation resistance of these variants in comparison to strain LY-S may be due at least in part to recovery of the ability to rejoin frank DNA double-strand breaks.","['Evans, H H', 'Ricanati, M', 'Horng, M F']","['Evans HH', 'Ricanati M', 'Horng MF']","['Department of Radiology, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH 44106.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', '*DNA Repair', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L5178/*genetics/pathology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Temperature']",1987/11/01 00:00,1987/11/01 00:01,['1987/11/01 00:00'],"['1987/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1987 Nov;84(21):7562-6. doi: 10.1073/pnas.84.21.7562.,"['CA 15901/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 23427/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['10.1073/pnas.84.21.7562 [doi]'],,PMC299339,,,,

It thus was striking to find that cloned rDNA from the frog Xenopus laevis is specifically transcribed in extracts prepared from mouse cells. The data in this paper demonstrate that this heterologous transcription is due to a normal initiation process and not to a fortuitous event. Transcription of Xenopus rDNA in the mouse cell extract is directed by the same large promoter (residue-141 to +6) that is utilized to promote the synthesis of frog rRNA in homologous Xenopus systems. Moreover, the same factors of the mouse cell extract that transcribe the homologous mouse rDNA also catalyze transcription from the X. laevis rDNA promoter. We conclude that polymerase I transcriptional machinery does not evolve as rapidly as prior studies would suggest.","['Culotta, V C', 'Wilkinson, J K', 'Sollner-Webb, B']","['Culotta VC', 'Wilkinson JK', 'Sollner-Webb B']","['John Hopkins School of Medicine, Department of Biological Chemistry, Baltimore, MD 21205.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (DNA, Ribosomal)', '0 (RNA, Ribosomal)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.7.6 (RNA Polymerase I)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'DNA, Ribosomal/*genetics', 'Leukemia L1210/metabolism', 'Mice/*genetics', 'Mutation', 'RNA Polymerase I/*metabolism', 'RNA, Ribosomal/*genetics', 'Species Specificity', 'Templates, Genetic', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Xenopus laevis/*genetics']",1987/11/01 00:00,1987/11/01 00:01,['1987/11/01 00:00'],"['1987/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1987 Nov;84(21):7498-502. doi: 10.1073/pnas.84.21.7498.,['GM27720/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],['10.1073/pnas.84.21.7498 [doi]'],,PMC299323,,,,

These investigations were conducted in 4 patients after the first infusion of high-dose ara-C therapy (3 g/m2 i.v. infused over 2 hr) and, following the failure of each to respond, after the initial bolus of F-ara-A monophosphate (50-100 mg/m2 i.v. over 30 min) in a subsequent treatment regimen.

To evaluate the possibility that diminished deoxycytidine kinase was a mechanism of drug resistance, the relative area under the concentration X time curve (AUC) of the active triphosphate of each prodrug in the CLB of individuals was compared. The intracellular nucleotide AUC was normalized by dividing it by the AUC of the respective nucleoside in plasma. A value of 1.0 for the resulting ratio would be expected if the accumulation and retention of F-ara-ATP and ara-CTP were identical. In these patients, however, this ratio ranged between 0.2 and 68.2. When a similar analysis was performed in vitro using four established human leukemia cell lines, a 150-fold variation was found in the normalized nucleotide AUC ratio.

Twenty patients (62.5%) with first relapse AML achieved M1 marrow, whereas only two of 13 patients with refractory AML did; none of four patients with more than one prior remission responded. Marrow recovery was observed in a median of 32 days. Remissions were maintained with monthly ara-C plus mitoxantrone alternating with ara-C plus 6-TG; median duration of remission was 8 months and two patients are in continuing remission at 8 and 16 months.

The effect of ditercalinium on cell proliferation and its interaction with DNA in situ has been investigated in the Friend leukemia cell system. Ditercalinium caused an inhibition of cell growth at 0.5 microM and cell death at 2.5 microM. However, both the cytokinetic and cytotoxic effects became evident only after 1-2 days of continuous drug exposure. In contrast, monointercalators generally affect cell growth within several hours of administration. Furthermore, whereas most intercalators arrest cells in G2 phase, ditercalinium demonstrated no cell cycle phase specificity. In fact, a stathmokinetic experiment, in which vinblastine was used to prevent cell division in exponentially growing Friend leukemia cell cultures, demonstrated that ditercalinium effectively ""froze"" cells in position throughout the cell cycle, in a dose-dependent fashion. By determining the sensitivity of DNA in situ in fixed Friend leukemia cells to acid-induced denaturation, it was apparent that ditercalinium, rather than stabilizing DNA as do monointercalators, increased the sensitivity of DNA in situ to denaturation induced by acid. It appears, therefore, that the cytokinetic effects and interaction with chromatin of an agent that has the ability to bisintercalate into DNA are qualitatively different from those induced by classical monointercalating drugs.","['Traganos, F', 'Bueti, C', 'Melamed, M R', 'Darzynkiewicz, Z']","['Traganos F', 'Bueti C', 'Melamed MR', 'Darzynkiewicz Z']","['Investigative Cytology, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10021.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Carbazoles)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Intercalating Agents)', 'VFS4ZUK33P (ditercalinium)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Antineoplastic Agents', 'Carbazoles/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Cycle/*drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Intercalating Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Mice', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1987/05/01 00:00,1987/05/01 00:01,['1987/05/01 00:00'],"['1987/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1987 May;1(5):411-6.,['CA23296/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,

This strategy was previously used to isolate cDNA clones representing poly(A+)RNAs (mRNA) that are abundant in leukocytes from chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) patients. One limitation with the initial experiments was that the RNAs were isolated from heterogenous cell populations and it was impossible to distinguish whether all of the cells were producing the abundant mRNAs or if a subset of the cell population was responsible for the majority of the RNA species. To resolve this important issue, we have directly hybridized radiolabeled cDNAs to the cellular RNAs of intact, morphologically distinguishable, primary hematopoietic cells. In the present study clone pC-A3, which represents an mRNA species that is abundant in the chronic phase of CML, was used to examine three samples from normal bone marrow, one sample from normal peripheral blood, and four samples from peripheral blood of leukemic patients (one Ph1 + AL, two CML in compensated phase, and one CML in accelerated phase). The results show that while C-A3 gene expression is detectable in cells from the granulocytic, monocytic, and lymphoid lineage, its relative abundance peaks at the level of the neutrophilic myelocytes and promyelocytes. Earlier myeloid precursors like myeloblasts or mature neutrophilic granulocytes show less labeling. Further, all maturation stages of eosinophils (Eos) and basophil (Baso) are highly labeled. This finding reinforces recent evidence that Eos and Baso share a common progenitor and suggests that these two cell types may have a stronger role than previously noted in the prominent myeloproliferative response that is characteristic of CML.","['Mars, W M', 'Stellrecht, C M', 'Stass, S', 'Frazier, M L', 'Saunders, G F']","['Mars WM', 'Stellrecht CM', 'Stass S', 'Frazier ML', 'Saunders GF']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Texas M.

Because of this and other potentially beneficial effects, a trial of recombinant alpha 2 interferon was undertaken in myelodysplastic syndromes. The study population consisted of 14 patients, subclassified as two refractory anemia (RA), one RA with ring sideroblasts (RARS), nine RA with excess blasts (RAEB), and two chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMMoL). The planned dosage schedule was 2.0 MU/M2 t.i.w. sc x 2 weeks q 4 weeks for at least two cycles. No patient achieved the prospective remission criteria, which included sustained blood count improvements. Transient improvements of platelet counts of greater than 50% in baseline were noted in six patients, and a transient antileukemic effect was noted in one patient with CMMoL. Myelodysplastic syndrome patients were found to be sensitive to the count suppressing effects of alpha 2 interferon with greater than 25% suppression of granulocytes, platelets, or reticulocytes transiently noted in 11 patients and decreasing bone marrow cellularity noted in two while on treatment. Because of these effects, dosage adjustments were frequently instituted in the RA, RARS, and RAEB patients. The average dosages and durations of treatment received were thus 1.48 MU/M2 x 19.4 injections for patients with RA, RARS, and RAEB and 2.25 MU/M2 x 27 injections for the CMMoL patients. Progression to acute myeloid leukemia or RAEB in transformation was noted in five patients, and increasing leukocytosis was noted in one CMMoL patient while on protocol. It cannot be determined at this time whether these transformations were accelerated by alpha 2 interferon or represent selection bias in this study population.

The growth pattern of small clusters is more commonly associated with APL than with other types of acute myeloid leukemia.","['Hollings, P E', 'Fitzgerald, P H']","['Hollings PE', 'Fitzgerald PH']","['Cancer Society of New Zealand Cytogenetics Unit, Christchurch Hospital, New Zealand.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Female', 'Granulocytes', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*pathology', 'Macrophages', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Proto-Oncogenes', 'Translocation, Genetic']",1987/01/01 00:00,1987/01/01 00:01,['1987/01/01 00:00'],"['1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1987;11(9):775-80. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(87)90061-0.,,['10.1016/0145-2126(87)90061-0 [doi]'],,,,,,

The biology of astrocytic neoplasms can be interpreted in light of concepts that have emerged from studies of the myeloproliferative disorders. Astrocytomas may arise from a pluripotential precursor cell whose progeny, although transformed, retain the ability to differentiate, and do so along astrocytic lines. The result is a neoplasm composed of ""mature"" tumor cells, similar one to another, and resembling normal astrocytes. Malignant change, like blast crisis in CML, then occurs as a consequence of further molecular genetic events leading to accelerated growth and maturation arrest in a previously differentiating neoplastic cell. This hypothesis challenges the conventional view that astrocytomas arise from astrocytes and that malignant change occurs as a result of dedifferentiation. Extensions of this hypothesis may be relevant to the biology of other glial tumors.","['Cairncross, J G']",['Cairncross JG'],"['Department of Clinical Neurological Sciences, University of Western Ontario, London, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Neurooncol,Journal of neuro-oncology,8309335,,IM,"['Animals', 'Astrocytoma/*etiology/pathology', 'Brain Neoplasms/*etiology/pathology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', '*Models, Neurological']",1987/01/01 00:00,1987/01/01 00:01,['1987/01/01 00:00'],"['1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Neurooncol. 1987;5(2):99-104. doi: 10.1007/BF02571297.,,['10.1007/BF02571297 [doi]'],,,,,,

The maximal rate of iron uptake from 59Fe-labeled transferrin, 1.5 X 10(6) atoms of Fe/cell per 30 min in uninduced cells, increased to 3 X 10(6) atoms/cell after 5 days of induction. The increase in iron uptake was not accompanied by a proportional increase in the number of transferrin receptors detected by 125I-labeled transferrin binding, suggesting a more efficient iron uptake by transferrin receptors in induced cells, with the rate of about 26 iron atoms per receptor per hour, compared to 15 atoms in uninduced cells. In agreement with this conclusion are results of the study of cellular 125I or 59Fe labeled transferrin kinetics. In the induced cells transferrin endocytosis and release proceeded with identical rates and all the endocytosed iron was retained inside the cell. On the other hand, transferrin release by uninduced cells was significantly slower and a substantial part of internalized 59Fe was released. On the basis of these results, different efficiency of iron release from internalized transferrin, accompanied by changes in cellular transferrin kinetics, is proposed as one of the factors determining the rate of iron uptake by developing erythroid cells.","['Hradilek, A', 'Neuwirt, J']","['Hradilek A', 'Neuwirt J']","['Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Prague, Czechoslovakia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', '0 (Transferrin)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', '*Endocytosis', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Iron/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Receptors, Transferrin/metabolism', 'Transferrin/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1987/10/01 00:00,1987/10/01 00:01,['1987/10/01 00:00'],"['1987/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 1987 Oct;133(1):192-6. doi: 10.1002/jcp.1041330126.,,['10.1002/jcp.1041330126 [doi]'],,,,,,

One of our original aims was to clarify how human granulocyte (differentiated HL-60 cells) synthesized enough precursors of lipid mediators, such as prostaglandins and/or platelet activating factor. Comparison studies yielded the following results. 1) After granulocyte differentiation, total phospholipid of HL-60 cells decreased to about 70% of that of untreated cells, while the content of triglyceride increased to about 200% of the original level. 2) The subclass composition of ethanolamine-containing glycerophospholipid was greatly altered during differentiation; 1-alkenyl-2-acyl glycerophosphoethanolamine (GPE) increased to 166% of that in the untreated cells, while 1,2-diacyl GPE decreased to 46% of the original value. The resultant profile became very similar to that of human peripheral polymorphonuclear leukocytes. 3) During differentiation, the amount of arachidonic acid stored in both phospholipid and triglyceride of retinoic acid-treated HL-60 cells significantly increased. Its distribution was also modified; arachidonic acid in 1,2-diacyl GPE decreased to 63%, while those of 1-alkenyl-2-acyl GPE, choline-containing glycerophospholipids, and phosphatidylinositol increased to 169, 154, and 153%, respectively. These results suggested that the regulatory mechanism of lipid turnover in HL-60 cells was modified during retinoic acid-induced granulocyte differentiation.

During 6 hr of coculturing monocytes and target cells, the recombinant TNF antiserum inhibited killing of the extremely TNF-sensitive WEHI 164 clone 13 cells and actinomycin D-treated WEHI 164 cells from which the clone 13 cells were derived (parental WEHI 164 cells (P-WEHI 164 cells]. The CF antiserum also inhibited monocyte-mediated killing of these cells during 6 hr of coculturing with monocytes, but on a per volume basis it was less potent than the recombinant TNF antiserum, consistent with the fact that the CF antiserum also was much less potent in inhibiting the cytotoxic activity of recombinant TNF. However, during 72 hr of coculturing with monocytes and target cells, the CF antiserum inhibited monocyte-mediated killing of P-WEHI 164 cells more efficiently than the recombinant TNF antiserum. Moreover, during 72 hr of coculturing with monocytes, only the CF antiserum was able to significantly inhibit monocyte-mediated killing of the relatively recombinant TNF-resistant K562 cells. This suggests that a factor immunologically different from recombinant TNF, perhaps a form of natural TNF differing somewhat immunologically from recombinant TNF, was involved in the killing of K562 cells, and possibly in the killing of P-WEHI 164 cells, during 72 hr of coculturing with monocytes. Although this factor was present extracellularly, it appears that it may act as a monocyte-associated factor in monocyte-mediated killing of K562 cells, since exposure to recombinant interferon-gamma (rIFN-gamma) in the absence of Escherichia coli endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide, LPS) activated the monocytes to mediate killing of K562 cells more efficiently than exposure to LPS alone, despite the fact that only little cytotoxic/cytostatic activity was released from the monocytes without the addition of LPS. The ability of rIFN-gamma and LPS to activate monocytes to produce and release CF has also been studied.","['Nissen-Meyer, J', 'Espevik, T']","['Nissen-Meyer J', 'Espevik T']","['Institute of Cancer Research, University of Trondheim, Norway.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Cell Immunol,Cellular immunology,1246405,"['0 (Cytotoxins)', '0 (Immune Sera)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Colorimetry/methods', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Cytotoxins/*immunology', 'Fibrosarcoma', 'Humans', '*Immune Sera', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Mice', 'Monocytes/*immunology', 'Recombinant Proteins/*immunology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*immunology']",1987/10/15 00:00,1987/10/15 00:01,['1987/10/15 00:00'],"['1987/10/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/10/15 00:01 [medline]', '1987/10/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cell Immunol. 1987 Oct 15;109(2):384-96. doi: 10.1016/0008-8749(87)90321-2.,,"['0008-8749(87)90321-2 [pii]', '10.1016/0008-8749(87)90321-2 [doi]']",,,,,,

This study examines the effect of the macrocyclic lactone bryostatin 1 on phorbol ester responses in a Friend erythroleukemia cell clone, PS 7. In several biological systems, bryostatin 1 was reported to mimic phorbol ester action, including activation of protein kinase C, but in HL-60 cells it blocked phorbol ester-induced differentiation. We report here that bryostatin 1 blocks phorbol ester action in Friend cells (clone PS 7), a second differentiating system. In this system, in contrast to HL-60 cells, the phorbol esters inhibit rather than induce differentiation. Bryostatin 1 restores the differentiation response [50% effective dose, 15 +/- 3.5 nM (SEM)] as well as blocks a second phorbol ester effect, induction of cellular adherence. The inhibition of erythroid differentiation by dexamethasone, a nonphorbol compound whose action presumably is not protein kinase C mediated, is unaffected by bryostatin 1. Although bryostatin 1 inhibits [3H]phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate binding in intact Friend erythroleukemia cell clone PS 7, the mechanism for the antagonism of phorbol ester action by bryostatin 1 in Friend cells cannot be explained by simple competition at the binding site.","[""Dell'Aquila, M L"", 'Nguyen, H T', 'Herald, C L', 'Pettit, G R', 'Blumberg, P M']","[""Dell'Aquila ML"", 'Nguyen HT', 'Herald CL', 'Pettit GR', 'Blumberg PM']","['Molecular Mechanisms of Tumor Promotion Section, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Acetamides)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Bryostatins)', '0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (Lactones)', '0 (Macrolides)', '0 (Phorbol Esters)', '37558-16-0 (Phorbol 12,13-Dibutyrate)', '37O2X55Y9E (bryostatin 1)', 'LA133J59VU (hexamethylene bisacetamide)']",IM,"['Acetamides/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Bryostatins', 'Carcinogens/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Lactones/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/pathology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*pathology', 'Macrolides', 'Mice', 'Phorbol 12,13-Dibutyrate', 'Phorbol Esters/antagonists & inhibitors/*pharmacology']",1987/11/15 00:00,1987/11/15 00:01,['1987/11/15 00:00'],"['1987/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1987/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1987 Nov 15;47(22):6006-9.,"['CA-16049-07-08/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-16049-07-09/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,

Surface iodination revealed that MCS-2 antigen on the surfaces of acute myelogenous leukemia cells, HL-60 cells, and polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) had the same molecular weight (Mr 150,000) and that their autoradiographic bands were also the same. Internal labeling of HL-60 cells with [35S]methionine followed by immunoprecipitation revealed two bands whose molecular weights were 150,000 and 130,000. HL-60 cells gave stronger bands than did PMN. The intensity of the Mr 130,000 band became weaker, when internally pulse-labeled cells were cultured in the absence of labeled methionine, suggesting that Mr 130,000 glycoprotein was a precursor protein of Mr 150,000 glycoprotein. MCS-2 mAb precipitated two bands from tunicamycin-treated HL-60 cells whose apparent molecular weights were 100,000 and 110,000. When cells were cultured with MCS-2 mAb, expression of the antigen decreased rapidly (within 10 min). The degree of suppression was more prominent in PMN than in acute myelogenous leukemia and in myelomonocytic cell lines. Reexpression of MCS-2 antigen by PMN after removal of the mAb from the culture medium was not observed, but it occurred rapidly in myelomonocytic cell lines, although it was blocked by pretreatment of the cells with cycloheximide. These findings suggested that the less-marked suppression of MCS-2 antigen expression by cell lines was due to its greater synthesis by these cells. These findings suggested that MCS-2 mAb reacted with identical molecules, which were recognized by other mAbs belonging to CD13. Furthermore, modulation of MCS-2 antigen was observed by MCS-2 mAb itself.","['Sakai, K', 'Hattori, T', 'Sagawa, K', 'Yokoyama, M', 'Takatsuki, K']","['Sakai K', 'Hattori T', 'Sagawa K', 'Yokoyama M', 'Takatsuki K']","['Second Department of Internal Medicine, Kumamoto University Medical School, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Antigens, Differentiation/*analysis', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*immunology', 'Molecular Weight', 'Neutrophils/*immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/immunology']",1987/11/01 00:00,1987/11/01 00:01,['1987/11/01 00:00'],"['1987/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1987 Nov 1;47(21):5572-6.,,,,,,,,

Further phenotypic analysis revealed the expression of the myelomonocytic-specific antigen Leu-M1 and receptors for the Fc portion of IgG. Partial differentiation of these cells could be induced by dimethyl sulfoxide, tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate, or hypoxanthine and resulted in cells of the myeloid series expressing lysozyme and receptors for the C3b complement protein. The karyotype was 46,XY, lacked the Ph1 chromosome, and displayed no abnormalities at the light microscopic level. No rearrangement of the bcr-c-abl gene complex was found.

Northern blot analysis of the RNAs of two of these patients showed the absence of a detectable 8.5-kb chimeric mRNA. In the third patient a chimeric mRNA was detected by a c-abl cDNA probe but failed to hybridize with a bcr cDNA probe and showed very low hybridization levels with further 5' bcr cDNA probes.

These same cells did not commit if left in the original inducer-containing media or if replated in fresh media without inducer. The two inducers could be interchanged in the priming and postpriming period without affecting the commitment event. However, hemin, an agent that induces hemoglobin synthesis without commitment, showed no ability to enhance commitment of a primed cell population. The rapid commitment of primed cells was inhibited by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate and cordycepin but not by cycloheximide. The latter finding indicated that this rapid inducer-dependent commitment event required new RNA synthesis but not new protein synthesis. The precommitment state was lost within six hours of the growth of cells in the absence of inducer but could be sustained longer if cells were incubated in cycloheximide. These studies characterize a precommitment state not previously described and one that appears during chemically induced differentiation in the absence of metabolic inhibitors. The stabilization of these precommitted cells by cycloheximide suggests that the reversibility of precommitment involves new protein synthesis. These findings show that MEL cells proceed to terminal differentiation by accumulating unstable products that must be maintained by the inducer until the final commitment event.","['DiMambro, E', 'Galanti, M', 'Levy, S B']","['DiMambro E', 'Galanti M', 'Levy SB']","['Department of Medicine, Tufts University School of Medicine, Boston, MA 02111.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Acetamides)', '42VZT0U6YR (Heme)', 'LA133J59VU (hexamethylene bisacetamide)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Acetamides/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Heme/pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/pathology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*pathology', 'Mice']",1987/11/01 00:00,1987/11/01 00:01,['1987/11/01 00:00'],"['1987/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1987 Nov;70(5):1565-71.,,['S0006-4971(20)79544-3 [pii]'],,,,,,

PB readily yielded high numbers of monocyte-macrophage colonies in CFU-C and CFU-GEMM assays when cultured in early remission, and the colonies were cytogenetically proven to have arisen from a malignant clone in patient 9. When studied later in remission, the abnormal cell proliferation persisted in three of the four patients, but in patient 8 PB colony growth resembled controls. Similarly, when PB from patient 8 was studied in liquid culture without using added growth factor, cell proliferation declined identical to controls, whereas PB from the other three patients showed exuberant growth of monocyte-macrophage elements.

Analysis of 242 patients.,445-54,"Two hundred forty-two patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia in blast crisis were reviewed to identify significant biologic and prognostic associations. Twenty percent of patients had lymphoid blast crisis. Clonal evolution was present in 60 percent of patients at blast crisis and involved most frequently the development of a double Philadelphia chromosome, trisomy 8, or isochromosome 17. The overall median survival from blast crisis was 18 weeks. Patient characteristics demonstrated to have significant association with short survival were: anemia; thrombocytopenia; myeloid or undifferentiated blast cell morphology; clonal evolution involving the presence of a double Philadelphia chromosome, trisomy 8, or isochromosome 17; and low marrow blast percentage. Of 195 patients who received therapy for blast crisis, complete remission was achieved in 44 (23 percent) patients, and 24 (13 percent) patients had a partial remission or hematologic improvement. Lower complete remission rates were associated with old age, thrombocytopenia, myeloid or undifferentiated blast cell morphology, clonal evolution--especially isochromosome 17 and trisomy 8--and long interval from diagnosis to onset of blast crisis. A multivariate analysis identified two characteristics to have independent prognostic importance for both survival and remission: platelet counts and blast cell morphology. In addition, clonal evolution had additive prognostic value for survival (double Philadelphia chromosome) and for response (isochromosome 17). The beneficial association of therapy with survival was demonstrated by the significantly longer median survival of patients treated since 1981 compared with those treated earlier, even after accounting for the pretreatment prognostic factors, and by the significant improvement in survival of patients achieving remission using the ""landmark"" analysis technique.","['Kantarjian, H M', 'Keating, M J', 'Talpaz, M', 'Walters, R S', 'Smith, T L', 'Cork, A', 'McCredie, K B', 'Freireich, E J']","['Kantarjian HM', 'Keating MJ', 'Talpaz M', 'Walters RS', 'Smith TL', 'Cork A', 'McCredie KB', 'Freireich EJ']","['Department of Hematology, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Hospital and Tumor Institute at Houston.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Med,The American journal of medicine,0267200,,IM,"['*Blast Crisis', '*Chromosome Aberrations', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/mortality/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Prognosis', 'Regression Analysis', 'Remission Induction', 'Time Factors']",1987/09/01 00:00,1987/09/01 00:01,['1987/09/01 00:00'],"['1987/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Med. 1987 Sep;83(3):445-54. doi: 10.1016/0002-9343(87)90754-6.,['28153/PHS HHS/United States'],"['0002-9343(87)90754-6 [pii]', '10.1016/0002-9343(87)90754-6 [doi]']",,,,,,

Annual incidence of ALL was 3.6/100,000 children aged less than 15 years, with an incidence for males of 3.8 and for females of 3.4 respectively. Half of the children were younger than 5 years of age at diagnosis, with a peak incidence between 2-3 years of age. The leukemias were classified as Standard Risk (SR), Intermediate Risk (IR) or High Risk (HR) leukemia according to prognostic criteria at diagnosis. The remission rate was 95%. In children greater than or equal to 1 year of age with non-B-cell ALL at diagnosis, the Event-Free Survival (EFS) was 0.58; 0.65 for SR-children, 0.51 for IR-children and 0.52 for HR-children. WBC count at diagnosis was the most important prognostic factor and a WBC count of 11-20 X 10(9)/l was associated with the worst prognosis of all WBC values (EFS = 0.30), independent of other prognostic factors. Male sex was the second most important adverse prognostic criterion. The follow-up in January 1986 (observation time 6-54 months), showed that 442 of the 656 children (67%) were in complete continuous remission. The total results indicate a possibility to improve the prognosis for most of the risk groups of ALL with a more intensive treatment.","['Gustafsson, G', 'Garwicz, S', 'Hertz, H', 'Johanesson, G', 'Jonmundsson, G', 'Moe, P J', 'Salmi, T', 'Seip, M', 'Siimes, M A', 'Yssing, M']","['Gustafsson G', 'Garwicz S', 'Hertz H', 'Johanesson G', 'Jonmundsson G', 'Moe PJ', 'Salmi T', 'Seip M', 'Siimes MA', 'Yssing M', 'et al.']","['Nordic Society of Paediatric Hematology and Oncology, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Sweden,Acta Paediatr Scand,Acta paediatrica Scandinavica,0000211,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/diagnosis/*epidemiology/therapy', 'Male', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Factors', 'Scandinavian and Nordic Countries']",1987/09/01 00:00,1987/09/01 00:01,['1987/09/01 00:00'],"['1987/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Acta Paediatr Scand. 1987 Sep;76(5):781-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1651-2227.1987.tb10565.x.,,['10.1111/j.1651-2227.1987.tb10565.x [doi]'],,,,,,

All lines expressed viral gene products and could be induced to express hemoglobin. Some lines produced infectious virus. In addition to the viral envelope-related proteins (gPr85, gp70, and gp52) detected by precipitation with goat anti-Rauscher gp70 antiserum from tumor cell lines induced by parental Friend virus strains, BSB-induced cell lines also expressed gp80, p52, and gp45 products precipitable with the same antiserum. A rat monoclonal antibody that recognizes an epitope of an amino-terminal region of gp52 (Wolff et al., 1982, J. Virol. 43, 472-481) also precipitated the gp80 and gp45 viral proteins.

Old age was associated with a higher incidence of poor performance status, hepatomegaly, and anemia. Fourteen other patient characteristics were correlated with poor prognosis, including black race, weight loss, symptoms, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, anemia, thrombocytopenia or thrombocytosis, increased peripheral blast cells and promyelocytes or basophils, increased blasts or basophils in the bone marrow, decreased megakaryocytes, and additional cytogenetic abnormalities. A multivariate analysis that accounted for the interactions of these factors identified old age as being of primary adverse prognostic significance in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia, suggesting a biologic difference in the disease in older patients.

The cDNA was identified by differential hybridization of synthetic oligonucleotide probes to a human erythroleukemic cell line (K562) cDNA library constructed in phage vector lambda gt10. The nucleotide sequence of the glycophorin B cDNA was compared with that of a previously cloned glycophorin A cDNA. The nucleotide sequences encoding the NH2-terminal leader peptide and first 26 amino acids of the two proteins are nearly identical. This homologous region is followed by areas specific to either glycophorin A or B and a number of small regions of homology, which in turn are followed by a very homologous region encoding the presumed membrane-spanning portion of the proteins. We used RNA blot hybridization with both cDNA and synthetic oligonucleotide probes to prove our previous hypothesis that glycophorin B is encoded by a single 0.5- to 0.6-kb mRNA and to show that glycophorins A and B are negatively and coordinately regulated by a tumor-promoting phorbol ester, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. We established the intron/exon structure of the glycophorin A and B genes by oligonucleotide mapping; the results suggest a complex evolution of the glycophorin genes.","['Siebert, P D', 'Fukuda, M']","['Siebert PD', 'Fukuda M']","['La Jolla Cancer Research Foundation, Cancer Research Center, La Jolla, CA 92037.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Glycophorins)', '0 (Sialoglycoproteins)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', '*Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA/*metabolism', '*Genes', 'Glycophorins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Sialoglycoproteins/*genetics']",1987/10/01 00:00,1987/10/01 00:01,['1987/10/01 00:00'],"['1987/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1987 Oct;84(19):6735-9. doi: 10.1073/pnas.84.19.6735.,['R01 CA33000/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['10.1073/pnas.84.19.6735 [doi]'],,PMC299158,,"['GENBANK/J02578', 'GENBANK/J02982', 'GENBANK/M12857']",['Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 1988 Jan;85(2):421'],

Nine patients with acute leukaemia, one patient with myelodysplastic syndrome, and ten normal volunteers were included in the study. The T1- and T2-relaxation processes were measured in the lumbar spine bone marrow using a wholebody superconductive MR-scanner operating at 1.5 Tesla. In the patients MRI was done at the time of diagnosis and during follow-up of chemotherapy and related to bone marrow biopsies taken within three days of the MRI. At the time of diagnosis T1-relaxation time was increased two to three times in the patients (range 0.7-3.0 sec.) compared to the controls (range 0.38-0.60 sec.). No significant difference was seen in the T2-relaxation process. In relation to chemotherapy T1 decreased towards the normal range in the patients who obtained complete remission, whereas T1 remained prolonged in the patients who did not respond successfully to the treatment.

Three of them have had antileukemic chemotherapy without HD-A, while one have had HD-A as a conditioning regimen for bone marrow transplantation. Only three cases were documented to occur in adult patients with AML. Patients treated with HD-A for RI or IC had a significantly lower risk of streptococcal septicemia during previous chemotherapy-associated febrile neutropenic episodes (1/55 vs 10/45; P = 0.01). Neither prophylactic regimens including trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole nor those without it were effective in preventing streptococcal septicemia.

Of 23 healthy ""tracer"" juvenile rhesus monkeys, 19 (83%) died with SAIDS within 9 months of introduction into the resident SAIDS-endemic population. In contrast, 21 healthy ""sentinel"" juvenile rhesus monkeys placed in the same outdoor enclosure but denied physical contact with the SAIDS-affected group by a 10-foot-wide ""buffer zone"" remained free of SRV-1, SRV-1 antibody, and disease for 2.5 years. The SAIDS-specific mortality rate was significantly higher in juveniles than in adults. In repeated serologic testing, the overall prevalence of SRV-1 antibody ranged from 68 to 85%. Antibody prevalence increased with age. Seroconversion was found to be a poor indicator of infection rate, as approximately 50% of virus-positive juvenile monkeys had no antibody detectable by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Repeated viral isolations from all animals revealed 1) SRV-1 viremia with clinical SAIDS; 2) persistent viremia and viral shedding in apparently healthy animals; 3) transient viremia and clinical recovery; 4) intermittent viremia, suggesting activation of latent infections; and 5) viremia in a 1-day-old infant, suggesting transplacental transmission. The prevalence of SRV-1 antibody in SAIDS-free breeding groups of rhesus monkeys was 4%. The seroprevalence of antibodies against human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV; formerly STLV-III) was uniformly low or absent in both SAIDS-free and SAIDS-affected groups of rhesus monkeys, demonstrating that these retroviruses are not etiologically linked to SAIDS at the California Primate Research Center.","['Lerche, N W', 'Marx, P A', 'Osborn, K G', 'Maul, D H', 'Lowenstine, L J', 'Bleviss, M L', 'Moody, P', 'Henrickson, R V', 'Gardner, M B']","['Lerche NW', 'Marx PA', 'Osborn KG', 'Maul DH', 'Lowenstine LJ', 'Bleviss ML', 'Moody P', 'Henrickson RV', 'Gardner MB']","['California Primate Research Center, University of California, Davis 95616.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (HIV Antibodies)']",IM,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/microbiology/transmission/*veterinary', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/analysis', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'HIV Antibodies', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Maternal-Fetal Exchange', 'Monkey Diseases/*microbiology/transmission', 'Pregnancy', 'Retroviridae']",1987/10/01 00:00,1987/10/01 00:01,['1987/10/01 00:00'],"['1987/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1987 Oct;79(4):847-54.,"['R01AI-20573/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'RR-00169/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'U01CA-37467/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,

The fluorescence of intracellular anthracycline measured on a flow cytometer was used as a marker to distinguish P388/S and P388/R cells. The proportions of low-fluorescent P388/R cells and high-fluorescent P388/S cells were determined from fluorescence histograms. Selective toxicity for multidrug-resistant P388/R cells was indicated by the decreased proportion of these cells in the mixed cultures. In untreated cultures grown from suspensions containing equal proportions of P388/R and P388/S cells, the mean proportion of P388/R cells after 4 days' growth was 34.4%. DOX eliminated P388/S cells from mixed cultures. Nitrogen mustard [(HN2) NCS-762] and x-rays were selectively toxic to P388/R cells. The selectivity of HN2 and x-rays was observed in a narrow dose range by the absence of selective inhibition at low doses, the decreased proportion of P388/R cells at moderate doses, and the killing of all cells in mixed cultures at high doses. Combination treatment of mixed cultures with DOX plus x-rays, or HN2 plus x-rays, produced complete inhibition of growth. Mixed cultures recovered after treatment with DOX plus HN2 contained only P388/R cells. Results obtained by colony-formation assay showed the same patterns of relative sensitivity for P388/R and P388/S cells as the data obtained by flow cytometry (FCM) selectivity assay. FCM analysis of mixed cultures detected selective toxicity for P388/R cells after treatments, characterized by approximately 1 log higher cell killing of P388/R cells than of P388/S cells. It was concluded that FCM analysis of mixed cultures provided a sensitive and reliable assay for fast screening of drugs for selective toxicity to multidrug-resistant cells.","['Frankfurt, O S']",['Frankfurt OS'],"['Grace Cancer Drug Center, Roswell Park Memorial Institute, New York State Department of Health, Buffalo 14263.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,"['50D9XSG0VR (Mechlorethamine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Doxorubicin/therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance', '*Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Leukemia P388/*drug therapy/radiotherapy', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*drug therapy', 'Mechlorethamine/therapeutic use']",1987/10/01 00:00,1987/10/01 00:01,['1987/10/01 00:00'],"['1987/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1987 Oct;79(4):831-6.,"['CA-13038/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-24328/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,

By selective mating of the mice with either high-virus or virus-free phenotypes, the following stably virus-positive and virus-negative sublines were obtained: SL/Ni-Eco+ and SL/Ni-Eco-, respectively. This polymorphism was produced by an epigenetic factor transmitted by SL/Ni-Eco- female mice via milk. F1 hybrids between SL/Ni-Eco- females with males of high-virus strains did not express ETV, whereas reciprocal F1 hybrids did. On the other hand, F1 mice between females of low-virus strains or of NFS mice lacking the ETV proviral genome and SL/Ni-Eco- males expressed a high level of ETV. Foster-nursing of newborn mice of high-virus strains by SL/Ni-Eco- foster-mothers or injection of pooled sera of SL/Ni-Eco mice resulted in intense inhibition of virus expression. On the contrary, nursing of SL/Ni-Eco- newborns by NFS/N foster-mothers resulted in high virus expression. These observations strongly support the hypothesis that failure to express ETV by SL/Ni-Eco- mice is due to a milk-transmitted maternal resistance factor, but probably not due to genetic heterogeneity among SL/Ni sublines. This factor caused strong, long-lasting, and selective suppression of endogenous ETV, but it did not confer resistance to exogenous infection of ETV. This activity was present also in the sera of SL/Ni-Eco- mice, since neonatal injection of the sera into high-virus strains of mice, SL/Ni-Eco+, SL/Kh, and AKR/Ms, caused strong selective suppression of ETV expression. By this procedure, the spontaneous occurrence of nonthymic lymphomas in SL/Kh mice was suppressed.","['Hiai, H', 'Buma, Y O', 'Ikeda, H', 'Moriwaki, K', 'Nishizuka, Y']","['Hiai H', 'Buma YO', 'Ikeda H', 'Moriwaki K', 'Nishizuka Y']","['Laboratory of Experimental Pathology, Aichi Cancer Center Research Institute, Nagoya, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,,IM,"['Animals', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Immunity, Maternally-Acquired', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains/*genetics', 'Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Retroviridae/*genetics']",1987/10/01 00:00,1987/10/01 00:01,['1987/10/01 00:00'],"['1987/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1987 Oct;79(4):781-7.,,,,,,,,

The increases in [Ca+2]i reached a peak within 15-90 s, attained 50% of the maximum level at 1.2 nM LTD4 and 60 nM LTC4, were greater in maximal magnitude for LTD4 than LTC4, and subsided in 5-7 min.

The capacity of pretreatment of HL-60 cells with LTD4 to prevent subsequent responses of [Ca+2]i to LTC4 and LTD4, and the finding that the serine-borate inhibitor of conversion of LTC4 to LTD4 suppressed concurrently both LTC4-induced rises in [Ca+2]i and increases in adherence to Sephadex G-25 indicated that the responses of HL-60 cells to LTC4 required conversion to LTD4. That pertussis toxin and a chemical antagonist of LTD4 reduced the [Ca+2]i response suggested a dependence on LTD4 receptors. The LTD4-induced increases in [Ca+2]i were dependent on extracellular calcium and diminished by lanthanum, but not affected by nifedipine nor associated with changes in membrane potential, as measured with the fluorescent probe 3,3'-dipentyloxacarbocyanine. Thus, the increase in [Ca+2]i in HL-60 cells, which is coupled to an increase in adherence, appears to involve LTD4 receptor-specific and voltage-independent calcium channels in the plasma membrane.","['Baud, L', 'Goetzl, E J', 'Koo, C H']","['Baud L', 'Goetzl EJ', 'Koo CH']","['Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of California Medical Center, San Francisco 94143-0724.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (Aminoquinolines)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (SRS-A)', 'N18RMK75W1 (indo-1)', 'O448IDK23O (Quin2)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Aminoquinolines', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cytosol/drug effects/metabolism', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/*pharmacology', 'Fluorescence', 'Humans', 'Indoles', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism', 'SRS-A/*pharmacology']",1987/10/01 00:00,1987/10/01 00:01,['1987/10/01 00:00'],"['1987/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1987 Oct;80(4):983-91. doi: 10.1172/JCI113192.,"['AI19784/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'HL31809/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",['10.1172/JCI113192 [doi]'],,PMC442336,,,,

We assessed the relative activity of 30 analogs of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 in inducing development of monocytic markers in HL-60 cells. The three differentiation markers assayed were nonspecific acid esterase activity, nitro blue tetrazolium reducing activity, and phagocytic capacity.

Removal of either the C-1 or C-25-hydroxyl group reduces activity by 2 orders of magnitude, while epimerization of the 1 alpha- to 1 beta-hydroxyl group virtually abolishes activity. Elongation of the steroidal side chain of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 by addition of one carbon at C-24 or C-26 improves the potency by an order of magnitude. Truncation of the steroidal side chain leads to a 10-fold reduction in activity for each carbon removed. Elimination of the C-26 and C-27 methyl groups reduces activity 100-fold. Analogs with short aliphatic side chains as 1 alpha-hydroxyhomo- and bishomopregnacholecalciferol have surprisingly high activity, being only 20-fold less potent than the natural hormone. The activity of most analogs in the HL-60 system parallels their known relative affinities for the well characterized 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 receptor in chick intestine, providing further evidence that this function of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 is receptor mediated.","['Ostrem, V K', 'Lau, W F', 'Lee, S H', 'Perlman, K', 'Prahl, J', 'Schnoes, H K', 'DeLuca, H F']","['Ostrem VK', 'Lau WF', 'Lee SH', 'Perlman K', 'Prahl J', 'Schnoes HK', 'DeLuca HF']","['Department of Biochemistry, University of Wisconsin-Madison 53706.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['EC 3.1.1.- (Carboxylic Ester Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.1.1.1 (Carboxylesterase)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']",IM,"['Calcitriol/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Carboxylesterase', 'Carboxylic Ester Hydrolases/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Monocytes/cytology', 'Phagocytosis/drug effects', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",1987/10/15 00:00,1987/10/15 00:01,['1987/10/15 00:00'],"['1987/10/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/10/15 00:01 [medline]', '1987/10/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1987 Oct 15;262(29):14164-71.,"['AM-32701/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK-14881/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",['S0021-9258(18)47919-7 [pii]'],,,,,,

Now we have found that phagocytic cells metabolize 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 not only to 10-oxo-19-nor-25-hydroxyvitamin D3 but also to a new metabolite eluted just after 24R,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 on straight phase high pressure liquid chromatography with a 2-propanol-hexane solvent system. The new metabolite, produced by murine myeloid leukemia cells (M1), was isolated in pure form and identified as 8,25-dihydroxy-9,10-seco-4,6,10(19)-cholestatrien-3-one on the basis of mass, ultraviolet, infrared, and proton magnetic resonance spectra. The 8 alpha-hydroxy epimer of the putative metabolite was chemically synthesized in two steps starting from 25-hydroxyvitamin D3. The spectral data and chromatographic behavior of chemically synthesized 8 alpha,25-dihydroxy-9,10-seco-4,6,10(19)-cholestatrien-3-one coincided exactly with those of the isolated metabolite, indicating that the stereochemistry of the hydroxyl group at the 8-position is alpha. On the basis of the structural characteristics of the two metabolites produced from 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (the present metabolite and 10-oxo-19-nor-25-hydroxyvitamin D3), it is suggested that dioxygenases are involved in the production of these metabolites from 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 in phagocytic cells.","['Yamada, S', 'Yamamoto, K', 'Takayama, H', 'Hayashi, T', 'Miyaura, C', 'Tanaka, H', 'Abe, E', 'Suda, T']","['Yamada S', 'Yamamoto K', 'Takayama H', 'Hayashi T', 'Miyaura C', 'Tanaka H', 'Abe E', 'Suda T']","['Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Teikyo University, Kanagawa, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Cholestenes)', '0 (Indicators and Reagents)', '109947-25-3 (8,25-dihydroxy-9,10-seco-4,6,10(19)-cholestatrien-3-one)', 'P6YZ13C99Q (Calcifediol)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Calcifediol/*metabolism', 'Cholestenes/chemical synthesis/*isolation & purification', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Indicators and Reagents', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/metabolism', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Mice', 'Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet']",1987/09/25 00:00,1987/09/25 00:01,['1987/09/25 00:00'],"['1987/09/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/09/25 00:01 [medline]', '1987/09/25 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1987 Sep 25;262(27):12939-44.,,['S0021-9258(18)45148-4 [pii]'],,,,,,

In a series of 179 cases of adult acute myeloid leukaemia peripheral leukaemic cell count and degree of maturation were found to be inversely correlated. As the degree of maturation of leukaemic cells in peripheral blood was lower than that in bone marrow in the majority of cases, blast cells appear to be released more easily from the marrow than cells that have matured to some extent in the direction of the larger promyelocytic or promonocytic cell type. In a series of 35 cases we found peripheral blast cells to be smaller than those in bone marrow. Moreover, central blast cell diameter and peripheral leukaemic cell count were inversely correlated. Therefore, leukaemic cell size or some factor related to it may contribute to the preferential egress of small immature cells from the marrow. Differences in proliferative activity could not account for the inverse correlation between degree of maturation and leukaemic cell count.","['van der Weide, M', 'Langenhuijsen, M M', 'Huijgens, P C', 'Imandt, L M', 'de Waal, F C', 'Mol, J J', 'van Rhenen, D J', 'Kester, D A']","['van der Weide M', 'Langenhuijsen MM', 'Huijgens PC', 'Imandt LM', 'de Waal FC', 'Mol JJ', 'van Rhenen DJ', 'Kester DA']","['Department of Haematology, Free University, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Eur J Cancer Clin Oncol,European journal of cancer & clinical oncology,8112045,,IM,"['Adult', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Granulocytes', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/*pathology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Leukocytes/*pathology', 'Mitosis', 'Prognosis']",1987/08/01 00:00,1987/08/01 00:01,['1987/08/01 00:00'],"['1987/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Cancer Clin Oncol. 1987 Aug;23(8):1125-9. doi: 10.1016/0277-5379(87)90144-1.,,['10.1016/0277-5379(87)90144-1 [doi]'],,,,,,

The in vivo distribution kinetics of DNR entrapped in leukemia cells (brown Norway acute myeloid leukemia, BNML) or in nucleated bone marrow cells, which had been exposed to DNR (0.2 mg/5 X 10(7) cells) in vitro, were determined. It was found that BNML leukemia cells and normal bone marrow cells take up DNR according to a linear pattern up to 400 micrograms/5 X 10(7) cells. When these DNR loaded cells are infused into the rat, dose dependent distribution kinetics are observed. Compared to i.v. injection of the same dosage, cell-bound DNR leads to a higher concentration and a higher tissue area under the curve of DNR in the liver (P less than 0.05) and the spleen (P less than 0.05), while equal levels are attained in bone marrow. Lower concentrations and area under the curve of DNR are observed in cardiac tissue of normal rats (P less than 0.001) and leukemic rats (P less than 0.05). It is concluded that DNR entrapped into marrow and leukemia cells follows different kinetics from free DNR in plasma.","['Sonneveld, P', 'Kokenberg, E', 'van der Steuijt, K', 'Nooter, K']","['Sonneveld P', 'Kokenberg E', 'van der Steuijt K', 'Nooter K']","['Dr. Daniel den Hoed Cancer Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Eur J Cancer Clin Oncol,European journal of cancer & clinical oncology,8112045,['ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism', 'Daunorubicin/*pharmacokinetics', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism', 'Leukocytes/*metabolism', 'Liver/metabolism', 'Myocardium/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred BN', 'Spleen/metabolism']",1987/08/01 00:00,1987/08/01 00:01,['1987/08/01 00:00'],"['1987/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Cancer Clin Oncol. 1987 Aug;23(8):1109-16. doi: 10.1016/0277-5379(87)90142-8.,,['10.1016/0277-5379(87)90142-8 [doi]'],,,,,,

A potentially cytotoxic drug level in CSF (10(-6) M) was never obtained for ID MTX cycles, but was achieved in 44% of HD MTX cycles: for HD MTX, this corresponded to 88% of patients (7/8). Total body clearance did not modify the degree of CSF MTX passage. A positive, significant correlation (r = 0.62, P less than 0.05) was observed for ID MTX between individual serum and CSF MTX; no such relationship was seen with HD MTX.

In the present study, the relation between lean body mass and body weight during cytostatic treatment was investigated in 3 groups of newly-diagnosed children and young adults with acute lymphocytic leukemia, osteosarcoma, or a small round cell sarcoma. Body weight and lean body mass were determined before and after an initial period of cytostatic treatment. Lean body mass was derived from total body water volume, which was assessed by deuterium oxide dilution. A significant dissociation between body weight and lean body mass was observed in leukemia patients (n = 8, P = 0.008, paired t-test), and in osteosarcoma patients (n = 13, P = 0.001). No dissociation was found in patients with a small round cell sarcoma (n = 8, P = 0.839). We conclude that during cancer chemotherapy periodic assessment of body weight may give a false picture of the preservation of lean body mass. Considering the course of body weight alone may prevent the establishment of a timely diagnosis of malnutrition, which is mandatory for optimal supportive care.","['de Graaf, S S', 'Meeuwsen-van der Roest, W P', 'Schraffordt Koops, H', 'Zijlstra, W G']","['de Graaf SS', 'Meeuwsen-van der Roest WP', 'Schraffordt Koops H', 'Zijlstra WG']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Groningen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Cancer Clin Oncol,European journal of cancer & clinical oncology,8112045,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Body Composition/*drug effects', 'Body Water/metabolism', 'Body Weight/*drug effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Male', 'Osteosarcoma/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Sarcoma/*drug therapy/metabolism']",1987/06/01 00:00,1987/06/01 00:01,['1987/06/01 00:00'],"['1987/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Cancer Clin Oncol. 1987 Jun;23(6):731-7. doi: 10.1016/0277-5379(87)90270-7.,,['10.1016/0277-5379(87)90270-7 [doi]'],,,,,,

Course 2 was given starting on day 24 with the addition of cyclophosphamide 1 g/22. Overall nine patients achieved complete remission (30%) and three attained a partial remission (10%), for an overall response rate of 40%. Four patients expired during induction whereas 14 had resistant disease. Response rate was significantly higher for patients with lymphoid compared to undifferentiated morphology (55% versus 10%; P = 0.05). In lymphoid blast crisis, Calla-positive disease was associated with a higher response rate compared to Calla-negative disease (75% versus 25%; P = 0.08). Eleven patients developed infections, and seven had fever without documented infections. The median overall survival was 29 weeks. Median survival was 43 weeks for patients achieving complete remission and 20 weeks for those with resistant disease. Remission duration was 39 weeks.

We have isolated a cDNA probe for lactoferrin and used it to study the synthesis of lactoferrin mRNA by normal and leukemic granulocyte precursors. The probe pHL-41 has been subcloned in phage m13 and characterized by restriction endonuclease analysis and nucleic acid sequencing. pHL-41 contains approximately 40% of the coding sequence of the lactoferrin gene. The 3' untranslated region includes a stop codon and a possible polyadenylation signal. There is a greater than 98% agreement between the cDNA-deduced amino acid sequence and that determined by analysis of the protein. Myeloid cells from normal bone marrow and circulating leukocytes from patients with chronic granulocytic leukemia contain lactoferrin mRNA transcripts that are indistinguishable in size and relative quantity. The human promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL-60 contains no lactoferrin mRNA. Induction of monocytic or granulocytic differentiation fails to induce the synthesis of detectable lactoferrin message. Similarly, studies with the human myeloblastic leukemia cell line PLB-985 reveal the inability of these cells to produce lactoferrin mRNA even under conditions that bring about morphologically demonstrable granulocytic differentiation. These data suggest that granulocytic differentiation in the leukemic cell lines is incomplete or defective.

Before treatment, the ratio of the measured extreme values (ie, highest/lowest value) for leukemic cell frequencies in bones from individual rats ranged from 3.7 to 11.7. During the MRD phase the ratios of the extremes ranged from a factor of 36 to more than 13,000 from one rat to another.

Influx of each folate compound proceeded with approximately the same Vmax, fluctuated in the same fashion with the ionic composition of the medium, and was blocked by low concentrations of an N-hydroxysuccinimide ester of methotrexate in both an anion-deficient buffer and in a buffered saline medium containing physiological concentrations of glucose and bicarbonate. Moreover, methotrexate influx was inhibited by 5-methyltetrahydrofolate and folate, and the inhibition constants (Ki) of the latter compounds were equivalent to their Kt values for half-maximal influx. Folate influx was likewise inhibited by methotrexate. The Ki for methotrexate was equivalent to its Kt for influx, and o-phthalate and phosphate each inhibited folate and methotrexate with the same degree of effectiveness. Various reversible and irreversible inhibitors reduced the influx of each folate substrate by greater than 90%, and the progression of inhibition in each case was indicative of a single uptake component. Folate influx exhibited the same high sensitivity to inhibitors of methotrexate influx when measurements were performed at folate concentrations near the Kt for influx (10-50 microM) or at concentrations approximating physiological conditions (5-20 nM). These results indicate that CCRF-CEM cells possess a single shared transport system for the uptake of methotrexate, 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, and folate and that other high- or low-affinity uptake processes are not present in these cells.","['Henderson, G B', 'Tsuji, J M', 'Kumar, H P']","['Henderson GB', 'Tsuji JM', 'Kumar HP']",,['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Buffers)', '0 (Phthalic Acids)', '0 (Tetrahydrofolates)', '6O7F7IX66E (phthalic acid)', '935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)', 'TYK22LML8F (5-methyltetrahydrofolate)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Buffers', 'Cell Line', 'Folic Acid/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*metabolism', 'Methotrexate/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Phthalic Acids/pharmacology', 'Tetrahydrofolates/*metabolism/pharmacology']",1987/09/15 00:00,1987/09/15 00:01,['1987/09/15 00:00'],"['1987/09/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/09/15 00:01 [medline]', '1987/09/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1987 Sep 15;36(18):3007-14. doi: 10.1016/0006-2952(87)90216-4.,['CA-23970/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['0006-2952(87)90216-4 [pii]', '10.1016/0006-2952(87)90216-4 [doi]']",,,,,,

Differentiation of induced MEL cells in the presence of exogeneously supplied protoporphyrin IX showed that total haem production was affected by added porphyrin only after 48 h. These data suggest that iron insertion, the terminal step, is rate-limiting during the first 48 h of differentiation. Addition of low levels of diethoxycarbonyl-1,4-dihydro-2,4,6-trimethylpyridine to differentiating cultures resulted in decreased haem production and decreased ferrochelatase activity. N-Methylprotoporphyrin at nanomolar concentrations also strongly inhibited ferrochelatase activity, but had no inhibitory effect on cellular haem production. The bivalent cations Co2+, Cd2+ and Mn2+ were tested for their effect on haem production and ferrochelatase activity. All three metals were found to inhibit both haem formation and ferrochelatase activity, with Mn2+ being the strongest effector. These data, together with those previously published, suggest that the terminal step in haem biosynthesis is rate-limiting during the early stages of differentiation in MEL cells.","['Fadigan, A', 'Dailey, H A']","['Fadigan A', 'Dailey HA']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (Cations, Divalent)', '0 (Organometallic Compounds)', '0 (Protoporphyrins)', '42VZT0U6YR (Heme)', '632-93-9 (Dicarbethoxydihydrocollidine)', '79236-56-9 (N-methylprotoporphyrin IX)', 'C2K325S808 (protoporphyrin IX)', 'EC 4.- (Lyases)', 'EC 4.99.1.1 (Ferrochelatase)', 'RX077P88RY (lead acetate)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cations, Divalent/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Dicarbethoxydihydrocollidine/pharmacology', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Ferrochelatase/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Heme/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*enzymology', 'Lyases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Mice', 'Organometallic Compounds/pharmacology', 'Protoporphyrins/pharmacology']",1987/04/15 00:00,1987/04/15 00:01,['1987/04/15 00:00'],"['1987/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1987/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem J. 1987 Apr 15;243(2):419-24. doi: 10.1042/bj2430419.,"['AM01038/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', 'AM32303/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States']",['10.1042/bj2430419 [doi]'],,PMC1147871,,,,

In AML cases we correlated the antigenic phenotype with morphological FAB classification. The study indicates a substantial antigenic heterogeneity of the surface antigen expression on leukaemia cells particularly in M1, M2 and M4 AML cases. The morphological subtype of these leukaemias tended to correlate with the immunologic phenotype, particularly in more differentiated AML cases such as M3 or M5. The most immature cell phenotype characterised ""undifferentiated"" AML, which was expressed by the reactivity or L243, BI3C5, MY9, VIM-2 and S3-13 Mc Abs with the majority of the patients.

Median age (range) for AML-patients was 47 yrs (19-89), and for DMPS-patients 60 (22-78). From the AML-group, 9 patients were either primary refractory or resistant to intensive re-induction treatment of relapse, 6 others had heavy pretreatment, 1 suffered from myelosclerosis. Five AML-patients had no pretreatment at first presentation and were started on LD-Ara C because of old age (3) or poor condition (2) including 1 patient with a secondary leukemia. DMPS included those with RAEB (8) and RAEB in transformation (7). 12 patients with AML and 4 with DMPS displayed a leukocytosis of greater than 10 X 10(9)/l. Three out of 21 AML-patients reached complete remission (CR), one of them twice, with partial remission (PR) at the third attempt with this type of treatment. Two other AML-patients reached a P.R. of 5 and 1 months duration respectively. Three patients experienced a transient response characterized by improved peripheral blood counts and cessation of transfusion requirements, one of them for 12 months. In 5 AML-patients no effect was seen and 8 pts. died. In the DMPS-group, 5/15 patients reached C.R., one patient twice with the same treatment, 1 patient reached a P.R., 1 improved, 6 showed no effect, and 2 died. In 13 patients final examination of the bone marrow was not performed after treatment because of either early death or obvious progression. Treatment was associated with significant, transient hematologic toxicity. Patients suffering from DMPS had prolonged aplasia and required more blood and platelet support than pts with AML. Responding leukemia patients had a rapid hematologic regeneration.

When cells were grown in the continuous presence of ketonucleosides, it was shown that the addition of an electrophilic agent (Br-) to the sugar moiety (compound KN-35) increased the cytotoxic potential by ten fold as compared to the unsubstitute compound (KN-43). In contrast, addition of 0-acetyl group (compound KN-3) reduced this effect by three fold. When cells were pre-treated with KN-35, followed by growth in drug-free medium, cell survival was inhibited by 50% (ID50) after 3 min, whereas the same effect was reached after 240 min pre-treatment with KN-43. When drugs were pre-incubated in serum-free medium prior to cell exposure, reduced cytotoxicity was observed.

Chronopharmacological studies suggest that there are seasonal changes in response of an organism to certain hormones and different chemical and physical agents. Childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) seemed to be a good candidate to test for such differences since in this disease the time of clinical onset and time of diagnosis are not far apart. Furthermore, almost all these children die from this malignancy. A median follow-up of 27 months (range 1-5 years), revealed a time-related increase in survival: From a trough during November-January, there was a steady rise to a peak in August-October (44.1%, 45.7%, 66.7%, and 80.0%, respectively). It appeared that the pattern primarily was due to girls presenting at the time of diagnosis with a white blood cell count of less than 50,000 cells/mm3. The difference between the seasonal survival curves was not significant in the male patients, nor in the subgroups presenting with 50,000 or more cells. Recently, a similar circannual survival pattern was found in a subgroup of patients with advanced breast cancer. These seasonally changing survival patterns should be taken into account when composing homogenous trial groups for therapeutic experiments in ALL as well as in breast cancer.","['Cohen, P']",['Cohen P'],,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Prog Clin Biol Res,Progress in clinical and biological research,7605701,,IM,"['Child', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Israel', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/diagnosis/*etiology/mortality', 'Male', '*Periodicity', 'Seasons']",1987/01/01 00:00,1987/01/01 00:01,['1987/01/01 00:00'],"['1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Prog Clin Biol Res. 1987;227B:343-8.,,,,,,,,

The partially purified factor (termed DIF-II) triggered erythroid differentiation when introduced into undifferentiated MEL cells that had been potentiated by the induction of DIF-I. The activity in the extracts appeared in an inducible manner after addition of dimethyl sulfoxide or hexamethylenebis(acetamide), reached a maximum at 6 hr, and then rapidly decreased. The induction was inhibited by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and also by cycloheximide. No induction was observed in a mutant MEL cell line defective in erythroid differentiation.

When 0.1-0.5 micrograms cepharanthine/ml was added along with VCR to L1210 cells in vitro, the cytotoxicity of VCR was potentiated 1.5-fold to 7-fold, whereas such potentiation was not found in mitomycin C, bleomycin, and 5-fluorouracil. The potentiating action of cepharanthine was stronger when the cells were preincubated with cepharanthine prior to the treatment of cells with VCR and cepharanthine, suggesting that a long-term contact with cells is required for the enhancement. Cepharanthine was found to induce the increase of the cellular level of VCR in L1210 cultured cells. It was suggested that the accumulation of VCR is due to the inhibition of a VCR efflux function of the cells. The administration of cepharanthine at the dose of 5 mg/kg/day for 10 days with VCR significantly enhanced the antitumor activity of VCR in L1210 leukemia and P388 leukemia (P less than .025). However, the combined effect of cepharanthine and VCR in this regimen was marginal synergism. When the same dose of cepharanthine was administered in split administration, three times daily for 10 days, the therapeutic effect of VCR was further enhanced compared to its effect under the former regimen. Furthermore, cepharanthine was found to partially overcome the resistance of VCR in P388/VCR.","['Kato, T', 'Suzumura, Y']","['Kato T', 'Suzumura Y']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,"['0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (Benzylisoquinolines)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '7592YJ0J6T (cepharanthine)']",IM,"['Alkaloids/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Benzylisoquinolines', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Resistance', 'Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy', 'Leukemia P388/drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Vincristine/*pharmacology']",1987/09/01 00:00,1987/09/01 00:01,['1987/09/01 00:00'],"['1987/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1987 Sep;79(3):527-32.,,,,,,,,

Each area had received recent attention because of suspected environmental pollution. The area adjacent to the Rocky Flats Facility (CO) was examined to identify any association between possible plutonium releases and increases in lung cancer or leukemia incidence. The industrial area of northern Contra Costa County (CA) was studied to explore a relationship between petrochemical industrial emissions and histologic-specific lung cancers. Finally, a suspected increase in the risk of congenital cardiac defects possibly related to pollution of the Santa Clara County (CA) water supply was investigated. No evidence of elevated risk of disease was found to be associated with either the Rocky Flats Facility or the polluted water of Santa Clara County. An increase in lung cancer, found by other investigators in earlier years, was shown to persist in association with industrial emissions in Contra Costa County.","['Selvin, S', 'Shaw, G', 'Schulman, J', 'Merrill, D W']","['Selvin S', 'Shaw G', 'Schulman J', 'Merrill DW']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,"['0 (Petroleum)', '0 (Water Pollutants, Chemical)', '53023GN24M (Plutonium)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'California', 'Female', 'Heart Defects, Congenital/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Lung Neoplasms/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Petroleum/adverse effects', 'Plutonium/adverse effects', 'Space-Time Clustering', 'Time Factors', 'Water Pollutants, Chemical/adverse effects', 'Water Supply/analysis']",1987/09/01 00:00,1987/09/01 00:01,['1987/09/01 00:00'],"['1987/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1987 Sep;79(3):417-23.,,,,,,,,

In an attempt to develop an alternate route to this analogue, 7-(2-azido-3-iodopropoxy)actinomycin was subjected to reduction with dimethylamine-borane complex; the reaction did not produce the three-membered aziridine; instead the reaction product was found to be linear 7-(2-aminopropoxy)actinomycin D.

Induction therapy consisted of two courses of daunomycin (DNM) plus cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C). Those patients who achieved remission were given four courses of consolidation with DNM, 6-thioguanine (6-TG) and escalated doses of Ara-C followed by six courses of sequential continuation therapy using monthly pairs: etoposide (VP-16)/Ara-C, Ara-C/6-TG, and DNM/Ara-C. Periodic intrathecal Ara-C was used for CNS prophylaxis. One hundred seven (80%) children achieved complete remission (CR). Kaplan-Meier estimates of 3-year disease-free survival (DFS) and event-free survival (EFS) are 41% and 33%, respectively. Relapses occurred in 34 patients after 5 to 97 weeks (32 marrow; 2 marrow plus CNS). Overall, 14 patients died of complications during treatment (nine during induction; five during the postremission phase), mostly from infection. Risk factor analysis showed that induction failures occurred predominantly in children with French-American-British (FAB) M5 and in those with elevated leukocyte counts; by step-up Cox analysis, only FAB subtype was predictive of remission success. None of the variables examined was significant for predicting the duration of remission. Hyperleukocytosis was predictive of a significantly worse EFS rate. These results are encouraging and further support the use of intensive chemotherapy programs for childhood AML.","['Amadori, S', 'Ceci, A', 'Comelli, A', 'Madon, E', 'Masera, G', 'Nespoli, L', 'Paolucci, G', 'Zanesco, L', 'Covelli, A', 'Mandelli, F']","['Amadori S', 'Ceci A', 'Comelli A', 'Madon E', 'Masera G', 'Nespoli L', 'Paolucci G', 'Zanesco L', 'Covelli A', 'Mandelli F']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Remission Induction', 'Thioguanine/administration & dosage']",1987/09/01 00:00,1987/09/01 00:01,['1987/09/01 00:00'],"['1987/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1987 Sep;5(9):1356-63. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1987.5.9.1356.,,['10.1200/JCO.1987.5.9.1356 [doi]'],,,,,,

AVID expression by MEL cells was found to be lost when they were treated with either dimethyl sulfoxide or hexamethylene bisacetamide, two chemicals that induce MEL cells to terminally differentiate. The kinetics of disappearance of AVID during inducer treatment reflected the kinetics with which the inducers caused MEL cell commitment to terminal differentiation. Loss of AVID expression by inducer-treated cells was inhibited by dexamethasone, which inhibits commitment and MEL cell differentiation. The subset of inducer-treated cells that expressed the least amount of AVID contained the greatest number of cells committed to differentiate.

Improvement of cytopenia and/or bone marrow hairy cell infiltration occurred in all but one patient. Often, blood and bone marrow improvements were dissociated and, after 7 or 13 months of therapy, complete remission was only observed in about 40% of patients. Recurrence of the disease was observed in some cases after cessation of therapy. A summary of the following results is presented: alpha-interferon receptor analysis, oncogene expression, study of the sensitivity of hairy cells to natural killer cells, and the effects of interferon on T-cell receptor gene rearrangement and on the function of T-cell clones. Results are also presented which show that myelofibrosis may be due to a release of platelet derived growth factor. The immunological findings and oncogene expression in 2 patients with a variant form of hairy cell leukaemia for which resistance to therapy was observed are also described. All the results show that interferon acts on hairy cells and are consistent with a direct effect by interferon in the treatment of hairy cell leukaemia.","['Sigaux, F', 'Castaigne, S', 'Lehn, P', 'Dupuy, E', 'Billard, C', 'Gluckman, J C', 'Boiron, M', 'Falcoff, E', 'Flandrin, G', 'Degos, L']","['Sigaux F', 'Castaigne S', 'Lehn P', 'Dupuy E', 'Billard C', 'Gluckman JC', 'Boiron M', 'Falcoff E', 'Flandrin G', 'Degos L']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer Suppl,International journal of cancer.

The chemotherapy consisted of mAMSA (100 mg/m2 per day i.v., days 1-3), ARA-C (100 mg/m2, twice daily, days 1-6), and VP 16 (150 mg/m2 per day, days 4-6). Four of the children achieved a complete second remission after one course of chemotherapy, and the fifth child died of pneumonia during bone marrow aplasia. All surviving children received an identical second course within 4-5 weeks, followed by maintenance chemotherapy. Remission duration was 0, 3, 4, 5, and 5 months. Toxicity was confined to heavy bone marrow depression with thrombocytopenia (nadir 2-7000, days 7-13) and leukocytopenia (nadir 0-400, days 8-14). Bleeding episodes could be prevented by substitution with platelets. Four patients experienced infections (pneumonia, septicemia). We conclude that combination chemotherapy using mAMSA, ARA-C, and VP 16 is effective in inducing a second remission in patients with early bone marrow relapse. The main side effect was considerable bone marrow toxicity.","['Berthold, F', 'Creutzig, U', 'Lampert, F']","['Berthold F', 'Creutzig U', 'Lampert F']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Haematol Blood Transfus,Haematology and blood transfusion,101169459,"['00DPD30SOY (Amsacrine)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)']",IM,"['Amsacrine/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Remission Induction', 'Time Factors']",1987/01/01 00:00,1987/01/01 00:01,['1987/01/01 00:00'],"['1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Haematol Blood Transfus. 1987;30:406-9. doi: 10.1007/978-3-642-71213-5_70.,,['10.1007/978-3-642-71213-5_70 [doi]'],,,,,,

Pharmacokinetics of DNR were studied at day 1. The concentration of DNR and daunorubicinol were determined in plasma, in white blood cells and in bone marrow. A large variability was observed with respect to (1) the plasma area under the curve (AUC) 0-24 h (range: 0.06-0.37 nmol X h/ml); (2) the white cell AUC 0-24 h (range: 0-441 nmol X h/10(9) cells); and (3) the 1 h bone marrow concentration (range: 0-27 nmol/10(9) cells). In eight patients treated twice, a small intraindividual variability of these parameters was observed. Concentrations in plasma did not correlate with cellular concentrations. All pharmacokinetic parameters in plasma and white cells did not correlate with response to therapy.

LAMA-84 cells have morphological features of undifferentiated blast cells, but analyses have indicated that they belong to the megakaryocytic lineage; platelet peroxidase (PPO) was found in 8.5% of cells; LAMA-84 cells reacted spontaneously with poly- and monoclonal antibodies against the platelet glycoproteins (GP) IIb, IIIa, and the GPIIb/IIIa complex, whose presence was confirmed by crossed immunoelectrophoresis. LAMA-84 cells lack the membrane characteristics of lymphoid and mature granulocytic cells but do, however, react with certain antibodies to immature myeloid cells. Furthermore, they are positive with an antiglycophorin antibody, and contain alpha- and gamma-globin mRNA, thus demonstrating erythroid marker expression. Thus LAMA-84 is a tripotent, megakaryocytic, erythroid, and granulocytic cell line. The megakaryocytic and erythroid markers were enhanced by the addition of DMSO, butyrate, TPA, and hemin. The LAMA-84 cell line represents an interesting tool for the study of megakaryocytic and erythroid differentiation and the mechanisms of neoplastic growth.","['Seigneurin, D', 'Champelovier, P', 'Mouchiroud, G', 'Berthier, R', 'Leroux, D', 'Prenant, M', 'McGregor, J', 'Starck, J', 'Morle, F', 'Micouin, C']","['Seigneurin D', 'Champelovier P', 'Mouchiroud G', 'Berthier R', 'Leroux D', 'Prenant M', 'McGregor J', 'Starck J', 'Morle F', 'Micouin C', 'et al.']",,['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'Cell Division', '*Cell Line', 'Cytogenetics', 'Erythrocytes/*physiology', 'Female', 'Histocytochemistry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/immunology/*pathology/physiopathology', 'Megakaryocytes/*physiology', 'Microscopy, Electron', '*Philadelphia Chromosome']",1987/09/01 00:00,1987/09/01 00:01,['1987/09/01 00:00'],"['1987/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1987 Sep;15(8):822-32.,,,,,,,,

Within a few weeks of cloning, distinct cellular morphologies and growth patterns became apparent in the four sublines. Growth rate measurements made over 3 months did not show any significant differences between the sublines. Surface protein profiles obtained by radioimmunoprecipitation using antisera in conjunction with extracts from [35S]Met and 125I-labeled cells revealed differences between the sublines. Analysis of total cell DNA showed that one of the sublines possessed only half the chromosome complement of the other sublines and the parental line. Karyotyping confirmed this result and, in addition, demonstrated that chromosome numbers fluctuated around a mean value for each subline. Karyotypic variability became apparent within 2 months of cloning and tended to increase with time in culture. G-banding analysis showed that the analyzed cell populations contained distinctive cytogenetic aberrations. Properties of the cloned sublines were monitored over a 9-month period. One of the sublines that had shown heterogeneous morphology even after 6 weeks maintained the heterogeneity throughout this time. Another subline underwent a marked change in morphology (round to irregular) and growth habit (single cells to large clumps) with increasing time in culture. Interestingly, several alterations to surface proteins accompanied these growth changes. A third subline had relatively stable morphology and chromosome number throughout the 9-month period. The modal chromosome number was hypotetraploid for three sublines and the parent line, but was diploid for another subline. However, it was interesting that progression toward tetraploidy in this subline was apparent after almost 2 years of culturing. The results showed that the original cell line consisted of a heterogeneous assemblage of cell types, some of which were quite unstable. Some implications for research using cultured cell lines are discussed.","['Snow, K', 'Judd, W']","['Snow K', 'Judd W']",,['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (Iodine Radioisotopes)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Sulfur Radioisotopes)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Clone Cells', 'DNA/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Iodine Radioisotopes', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Molecular Weight', 'Proteins/metabolism', 'Sulfur Radioisotopes']",1987/08/01 00:00,1987/08/01 00:01,['1987/08/01 00:00'],"['1987/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 1987 Aug;171(2):389-403. doi: 10.1016/0014-4827(87)90171-6.,,['10.1016/0014-4827(87)90171-6 [doi]'],,,,,,

Functional investigation showed that calcitriol-treated cells formed rosettes with sheep erythrocytes coated with an anti-sheep erythrocyte-specific IgG2a mouse MoAb and readily ingested them. In addition, these same sensitized erythrocytes were lysed in an 18-hr antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) assay. All together these data indicate the presence of functionally active Fc-IgG receptors (FcR). Sorting experiments demonstrated that only Leu M3+ HLA-DR+ cells contained the effector cell population; such was also the case for blood monocytes. This phenotypic profile was, however, not predictive per se of FcR presence and function, as 12,O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-induced HL60 cells neither formed rosettes nor phagocytosed nor exhibited ADCC activity, although they express Leu M3 and HLA-DR (as well as HLA-DQ) antigens. These results suggest that calcitriol and TPA cause the differentiation of HL60 cells along distinct pathways. On the other hand, different subpopulations with given predetermined differentiation capabilities may coexist in HL60 cell line. This hypothesis gains support by the observation that when TPA and calcitriol were added together to the undifferentiated cells, the resulting phenotypic pattern was representative of the different activities of both of the inducers as they were used separately.","['Rossi, P', 'Chini, L', 'Fattorossi, A', 'Gidlund, M', 'Galli, E', 'Laan, K', 'Jondal, M', 'Wigzell, H']","['Rossi P', 'Chini L', 'Fattorossi A', 'Gidlund M', 'Galli E', 'Laan K', 'Jondal M', 'Wigzell H']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Immunol Immunopathol,Clinical immunology and immunopathology,0356637,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (HLA-DQ Antigens)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Calcitriol/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'HLA-DQ Antigens/analysis', 'HLA-DR Antigens/analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Male', 'Monocytes/analysis/*pathology', 'Receptors, Fc/analysis', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology']",1987/09/01 00:00,1987/09/01 00:01,['1987/09/01 00:00'],"['1987/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Clin Immunol Immunopathol. 1987 Sep;44(3):308-16. doi: 10.1016/0090-1229(87)90074-2.,,['10.1016/0090-1229(87)90074-2 [doi]'],,,,,,

Based on its in vitro ability to induce differentiation in several myeloid leukemic cell lines, retinoic acid (RA) has been applied clinically in cases of myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid and promyelocytic leukemia. In the present study we have determined in detail the ability of RA to induce expression of granulocytic functions in a human promyelocytic leukemia cell line (HL-60) and compared it with that of dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO). Several granulocytic characteristics (phagocytosis, surface adherence and generation of free radicals in response to phorbol-ester) were induced to the same degree by both agents. Other normal neutrophil functions, including lysozyme accumulation, spontaneous migration, chemotactic activity toward zymosan-activated serum (containing C5a), the peptide N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (FMLP) and spontaneous motility in semi-solid medium were induced by DMSO, but they were absent or incompletely expressed in RA-induced cells.

The initial dose of 1100 mg/m2 was ineffective clinically and biochemically. Dose escalations to 1650, 2200, and finally 3300 mg/m2 resulted in a marked decrease in the absolute number of blasts without causing bone marrow hypoplasia or marked neutropenia. The decrease in the peripheral blast cell count was observed subsequent to a decline in GTP concentrations in the leukemic cells to less than 30% of the pretreatment value. Consecutive bone marrow examinations showed a remarkable shift from myeloblasts to more mature myeloid elements, suggesting an in vivo differentiative action of tiazofurin. Although a total dose of 23,650 mg/m2 was administered over a 13-day period, only very mild side effects were noted. The absence of complications reported by others in Phase I trials with tiazofurin may be related to our slow administration of the drug by pump over a 1-h period in this trial. Tiazofurin appears to be a promising agent in the treatment of leukemia because of its selective action on leukemic cells and the availability of a rapid in vitro method capable of predicting sensitivity of leukemic cells to the agent and monitoring its activity during treatment by measuring thiazole-4-carboxamide adenine dinucleotide and GTP concentrations. These observations are being tested in a larger group of leukemic patients.","['Tricot, G J', 'Jayaram, H N', 'Nichols, C R', 'Pennington, K', 'Lapis, E', 'Weber, G', 'Hoffman, R']","['Tricot GJ', 'Jayaram HN', 'Nichols CR', 'Pennington K', 'Lapis E', 'Weber G', 'Hoffman R']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Ribonucleosides)', '49717AWG6K (Ribavirin)', '86-01-1 (Guanosine Triphosphate)', 'ULJ82834RE (tiazofurin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects', 'Guanosine Triphosphate/analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Ribavirin/adverse effects/analogs & derivatives/metabolism/*therapeutic use', 'Ribonucleosides/*therapeutic use']",1987/09/15 00:00,1987/09/15 00:01,['1987/09/15 00:00'],"['1987/09/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/09/15 00:01 [medline]', '1987/09/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1987 Sep 15;47(18):4988-91.,"['5 SO7 RR 5371/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-13526/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-42510/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,['Cancer Res 1988 Feb 15;48(4):1047'],

Endoplasmic reticulum and transition structures (pre-Golgi compartment) of HL60 cells stained positively for peroxidase using diaminobenzidine but stained sparsely for reducing groups with osmium-zinc iodide. Staining of Golgi elements was relatively indistinct with diaminobenzidine and strong with osmium-zinc iodide, in comparison to freshly harvested promyelocytes which have intense diaminobenzidine and osmium-zinc iodide staining of the pre-Golgi and Golgi compartments. Cytoplasmic polyribosomes were more numerous in middle and high passage cells, whereas dilatation of endoplasmic reticulum was less prominent in these cells. The mean granule size was significantly increased in low passage cells, and staining of peroxidase was more prominent by light and electron microscopy when compared to high passage cells. Cytoplasmic granules demonstrated strong complex carbohydrate staining, indicating a lack of granule maturation in HL60 cells. Terminally differentiated myeloid cells were more frequent in low passage samples, and some neutrophil granule maturation appeared to occur within these cells, whereas all eosinophil granules consistently remained immature with intense complex carbohydrate staining and lack of crystalloid formation. These studies demonstrate significant differences between HL60 cells and normal promyelocytes, and also passage-dependent maturational differences in HL60 cells.

Rovera, D. Santoli, and D. Damskey, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 75: 2779-2783, 1979; E. Huberman and M.F. Callahan, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 76:1293-1298, 1979). This differentiation involves modulation of the expression of several cellular oncogenes. However, the significance of the temporal relationships between differentiation events and specific oncogene expression are not known. Others have reported that transcriptional down regulation of c-myc occurs early in the differentiation of HL-60 cells (R.D. Dalla-Favera et al., Haematol. Blood Transfusion, 28: 247-253, 1983; L.E. Grosso and H.C. Pitot, Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun., 119: 473-480, 1984). To determine the significance of the regulation of c-myc during HL-60 maturation, we performed parallel PDBu induction studies analyzing the kinetics of expression of c-myc, cell cycle frequency distribution, cytotoxic effector activity, and clonogenic potential in HL-60 cells and in a partial-differentiation resistant HL-60 clone (HL-60-1E3) (J. A. Leftwich, P. Carlson, B. Adelman, and R. E. Hall, Cancer Res., 47: 1319-1324, 1987). We report that PDBu stimulation results in early c-myc transcriptional down regulation in the HL-60-1E3 clone cells with the same kinetics as has been previously reported for HL-60 parental cells (R. D. Dalla-Favera et al., Haematol. Blood Transfusion, 28: 247-253, 1983; L. E. Grosso and H. C. Pitot, Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun., 119: 473-480, 1984). However, reexpression of c-myc occurs 15 hours postinduction in HL-60-1E3 but not parental cells. This reexpression is maintained through 30 h of stimulation and correlates with a lack of terminal commitment as assessed by an increase in clonogenic potential and the inability of these cells to acquire cytotoxic function. Sequential stimulation of HL-60-1E3 cells with DMSO and PDBu overcomes the block in macrophage differentiation (J. A. Leftwich, P. Carlson, B. Adelman, and R. E. Hall, Cancer Res., 47; 1319-1324, 1987). Such treatment results in a transient reexpression of c-myc at 15 h after PDBu treatment, and the complete downregulation of c-myc 24 h postinduction. These data suggest that the reported early decrease in c-myc transcripts following PDBu stimulus in HL-60 cells is not sufficient to commit these cells to macrophage-like terminal differentiation. Late regulation of c-myc gene expression may be an important additional component of the regulatory mechanisms which allow HL-60 cells to complete this program.","['Ely, C M', 'Leftwich, J A', 'Chenevix-Trench, G', 'Hall, R E', 'Westin, E H']","['Ely CM', 'Leftwich JA', 'Chenevix-Trench G', 'Hall RE', 'Westin EH']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Histones)', '0 (Phorbol Esters)', '37558-16-0 (Phorbol 12,13-Dibutyrate)']",IM,"['Cell Cycle', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Histones/biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Phorbol 12,13-Dibutyrate', 'Phorbol Esters/pharmacology', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Transcription, Genetic']",1987/09/01 00:00,1987/09/01 00:01,['1987/09/01 00:00'],"['1987/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1987 Sep 1;47(17):4595-600.,['CA 37026/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,

Treatment of K562 cells with the antineoplastic drugs 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine and daunomycin causes differentiation into hemoglobin-producing cells. The differentiation process is associated with an early block of cellular proliferation occurring during the first 24 h of treatment. RNA synthesis is progressively reduced to 20 to 30% of the control levels after 3 days of exposure to the drugs. Dot and Northern blot analyses were performed to evaluate the levels of c-myc or globin mRNA during the differentiation of K562. Daunomycin and 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine, despite their distinct chemical nature, induced similar modulation of mRNA levels. Globin mRNA did not change during the first 24 h of culture and began to increase after 48 h of treatment with drugs, reflecting the kinetic of appearance of hemoglobin-producing cells. In contrast, a transient decrease of c-myc mRNA was observed after the first 24 h of drug treatment, followed by a return to normal levels of c-myc mRNA after 48 h of treatment. Thus, the expression of c-myc mRNA in K562 did not reflect their proliferative activity nor their stage of differentiation.

Overall, 26% exhibited DNA stem line abnormalities, usually with a 10%-15% DNA excess, regardless of morphologic diagnosis. DNA aneuploidy was seen most frequently in patients with a hyperdiploid chromosome number and karyotype instability (50%), but was also present in a third of patients with chromosomal translocations and in 20% of patients with a normal diploid karyotype. Thus, among 73 patients with DNA aneuploidy, quantitatively concordant karyotype abnormalities were observed in almost 40% of patients; the discrepancy between DNA content and chromosome number in the remaining patients may reflect differences in the cell cycle position of target cells in G1/0 phase or mitosis, respectively. Cytogenetics affected treatment outcome in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) with more favorable short- and long-term prognosis among patients with translocations compared with those with numeric abnormalities. The presence of an abnormal DNA stem line, among AML patients with translocations, identified a favorable subgroup with significantly longer remission duration and survival (25 and 26 months versus 18 and 13 months, respectively). In addition, the prognostic implications of DNA aneuploidy in AML were age-dependent, in that favorable effects among patients with translocations and unfavorable effects among those with numeric abnormalities or diploid karyotypes were most obvious in young and not in older patients (greater than or equal to 40 years). In adults with ALL, DNA aneuploidy was associated with shorter survival (15 versus 39 months in the diploid group), an observation that is distinctly at variance with recent findings in childhood ALL. Our results indicated that DNA flow cytometry was complementary to standard cytogenetics for the detection of genomic abnormalities; and DNA aneuploidy emerged, like in children but not in adults with ALL, as a new favorable prognostic feature in a subgroup of adults with AML, the biologic basis of which remains to be determined.","['Barlogie, B', 'Stass, S', 'Dixon, D', 'Keating, M', 'Cork, A', 'Trujillo, J M', 'McCredie, K B', 'Freireich, E J']","['Barlogie B', 'Stass S', 'Dixon D', 'Keating M', 'Cork A', 'Trujillo JM', 'McCredie KB', 'Freireich EJ']",,['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis/*genetics', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/classification/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/classification/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', '*Ploidies']",1987/10/01 00:00,1987/10/01 00:01,['1987/10/01 00:00'],"['1987/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 1987 Oct;28(2):213-28. doi: 10.1016/0165-4608(87)90207-x.,"['CA 28153/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA28771/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0165-4608(87)90207-X [pii]', '10.1016/0165-4608(87)90207-x [doi]']",,,,,,

The cases were all classified according to FAB guidelines. Two thousand four hundred ninety-nine cases of acute myeloid leukemia were recorded, with similar total recruitment and distribution by cytologic subclass for both years. Hemogram data analysis revealed significant differences between different classes for certain parameters, particularly leukocytosis.

Eight hundred twenty cases of myelodysplastic syndromes were analyzed. Their frequency was underestimated due to optional reporting during the first year and the less favorable position of the university centers for recruiting these syndromes.

Therefore in vitro maturation was induced with the phorbol ester TPA in leukemic cell samples from 10 CLL, 4 PLL, and 4 IC patients. Morphologically, both plasmacytic and hairy cell-like phenomena were induced. The latter unexpected finding was confirmed by reaction with HD6 (CD22) antibody which stains HCL but is unreactive with plasma cells, multiple myeloma, and CLL cells. Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase was demonstrated in TPA-cultured CLL, PLL, and IC cells, and the same isoenzyme band as in HCL was revealed by isoelectrofocusing. On the other hand, an increase of IgM messenger RNA was detected in up to 20% of the cells in CLL cultures by single-cell in situ hybridization with fluoro-chrome-labeled DNA probes. An abundance of IgM messenger RNA characterizes lymphoplasmacytoid cells as found in IC.

Cell cycle status, cell density in culture, exposure to Fe, and differentiation alter Tf receptor display by myeloid leukemia cells. To investigate mechanisms controlling Tf receptor expression, rates of receptor synthesis and steady-state mRNA levels were measured in HL60 promyelocytic cells grown in serum and serum-free media or after differentiation in response to dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO). Although surface binding sites were unchanged during the first three days in culture with serum or in serum-free media containing Tf, by the third day, rates of receptor biosynthesis and steady-state mRNA levels declined, consistent with cell density-dependent, receptor regulation. Cells grown with soluble Fe instead of Tf showed reduced Tf binding sites, rates of receptor synthesis, and Tf receptor mRNA. When cells grown with Fe were subcultured, Tf receptor mRNA levels increased within 15 minutes and peaked by 24 hours. This was followed by a decline in receptor and gene expression so that by three days cells grown in the presence of Fe expressed approximately four times fewer receptors and had half the rates of Tf receptor synthesis and mRNA levels of cells grown in serum or Tf. Cells treated with DMSO showed a rapid decline in surface receptors, receptor synthesis, and steady-state mRNA levels. Modulation of Tf receptor expression was not due to redistribution between the cell surface and an internal receptor pool. In each instance, concurrent assessment of N-ras transcripts showed that changes in Tf receptor mRNA levels were not due to generalized alterations in protein synthesis. Exposure of cells grown in Fe or treated with DMSO to cycloheximide did not alter Tf receptor mRNA levels, thereby suggesting that receptor expression was not regulated by posttranscriptional processes dependent on protein synthesis. Actinomycin D inhibition of Tf receptor mRNA was compatible with a transcript half-life of approximately 2.2 hours. Nuclear transcription studies showed reduced rates of Tf receptor transcription after culture with Fe or exposure to DMSO. The present studies show complex patterns of Tf receptor gene regulation in cultured myeloid leukemia cells and demonstrate that transcriptional regulation is a major mechanism controlling Tf receptor gene expression in response to Fe and differentiation.","['Taetle, R', 'Ralph, S', 'Smedsrud, S', 'Trowbridge, I']","['Taetle R', 'Ralph S', 'Smedsrud S', 'Trowbridge I']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', '9007-73-2 (Ferritins)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cattle/blood/embryology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Ferritins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Iron/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism/pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Receptors, Transferrin/genetics/*physiology', 'Transcription, Genetic']",1987/09/01 00:00,1987/09/01 00:01,['1987/09/01 00:00'],"['1987/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1987 Sep;70(3):852-9.,"['CA23100/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA32094/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA37641/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['S0006-4971(20)78678-7 [pii]'],,,,,,

Secondly, a dose fractionation schedule that does not kill or perturb the kinetics of hemopoietic cell proliferation was sought in order to investigate the leukemogenic potential of low level radiation upon an unperturbed hemopoietic system. Doses used by others in past radiation leukemogenesis studies clearly perturb hemopoiesis and kill a detectable fraction of stem cells. The studies reported herein show that 1.25 rad every day decrease the CFU-S content of bone marrow by the time 80 rads are accumulated. Higher daily doses as used in published studies on radiation leukemogenesis produce greater effects. Studies on the effect of 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 rad 3 times per week are under way. Two rad 3 times per week produced a modest decrease in CFU-S content of bone marrow after an accumulation of 68 rad. With 3.0 rad 3 times per week an accumulation of 102 rad produced a significant decrease in CFU-S content of bone marrow. Dose fractionation at 0.5 and 1.0 rad 3 times per week has not produced a CFU-S depression after accumulation of 17 and 34 rad.

Fc receptors were also induced in cells after tunicamycin treatment. Induction of differentiation with tunicamycin decreased high activity of catalase in cultured leukemic cells. The results of digitonin titration experiments showed that in control granulocytes and differentiated leukemic cells most of the catalase activity is present in subcellular particles distinct from mitochondria or lysosomes.

Consequently, we studied the effects of these agents, singly and in combination, on fresh leukemic blast cells obtained from 13 acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) patients, most of whom were subsequently treated with recombinant leukocyte-alpha A interferon (rINF-alpha A). The in-vitro response to rINF-alpha A and RA was assessed in an established myeloid leukemic blast cell clonogenic assay containing conditioned medium from phytohemagglutinin-stimulated lymphocytes. Strong inhibition of colony cell growth (greater than or equal to 50%) was observed in 4/10 cases treated with rINF-alpha A alone, but only at high concentration (greater than or equal to 2500 U/ml) and in 4/10 cases treated with RA alone (5 X 10(-8) M or 5 X 10(-7) M). Combined rINF-alpha A and RA augmented the inhibition of primary or secondary colony cell growth in 5/8 evaluable cases. Stimulation of leukemic cell differentiation was observed in 1/8 cases by rINF-alpha A alone and in 4/7 cases by RA alone. Combined rINF-alpha A and RA enhanced cell differentiation in 4/7 cases. In addition, increased inhibition of clonal cell growth and/or differentiation by RA alone was observed in 2/5 cases following in-vivo rINF-alpha A treatment.

Time series periodic regression analysis of the monthly cumulative risk for ages 0-19 years revealed evidence of trimodal periodicity at seven of the nine locations tested. Combined analyses revealed a significant effect of latitude in causing asynchrony of the trimodal patterns observed. The average risk maxima occurred in April, August, and December for U.S.A. locations with latitude above 40 degrees (Seattle, Nebraska, Iowa, Detroit, and Connecticut), and in February, July, and October for other locations (San Francisco, Utah, New Mexico, and Atlanta). Because periodic regression analysis is a complex method, independent validation tests were performed to supplement the original results. Here, the best symmetric trimodal sine curve model of each location was utilized to predict the average pattern among the remaining locations of similar latitude. These validation tests supported the existence of similar trimodal patterns for all of the southern locations, and all of the northern locations except Connecticut. The observed peaks in monthly ALL risk coincide with seasonal elevations in the rates of allergenic and infectious diseases, elements of which are capable of promoting lymphocytic proliferation and transformation.

Natl. Acad. Sci. USA., 83:1208-1212) we had presented evidence for the occurrence of the cytoplasmic synthesis of globin mRNA and of RNA complementary to globin mRNA which differed from DNA-dependent transcription by its insensitivity to actinomycin D. In this paper, we describe the use of enucleated differentiating mouse erythroleukemia cells to demonstrate directly the occurrence of cytoplasmic synthesis of both positive- and negative-strand globin RNA. For this purpose, we developed an enucleation procedure which yielded pure cytoplasts from differentiated mouse erythroleukemia cells in the absence of cytochalasin B and selectively permeabilized the cytoplasts to small molecules by treatment with dextran sulfate and saponin. The permeabilized cytoplasts incorporated [3H]dUTP into positive- and negative-strand globin RNA and experiments with mercurated nucleotide substrate suggested that this process involved de novo RNA synthesis rather than limited terminal nucleotide addition. Globin RNA synthesis required Mg++, was inhibited by Mn++, and was unaffected by the addition of Zn++. Studies of its response to inhibitors of DNA-dependent RNA synthesis showed that it differed from that process in its insensitivity to actinomycin D and alpha-amanitin, but that like many other macromolecular biosynthetic reactions it was inhibited by rifamycin AF/ABDP and aurintricarboxylic acid. These observations provide additional evidence for the occurrence of cytoplasmic RNA-dependent RNA synthesis in differentiated cells and show permeabilized enucleated cells to be a useful experimental system for further studies of the characteristics of that process.","['Volloch, V', 'Schweitzer, B', 'Rits, S']","['Volloch V', 'Schweitzer B', 'Rits S']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Cell Biol,The Journal of cell biology,0375356,"['0 (Cations, Divalent)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (RNA Nucleotidyltransferases)', 'EC 2.7.7.48 (RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cations, Divalent/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane Permeability', 'Cytoplasm/*metabolism', 'Depression, Chemical', '*Erythropoiesis', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/enzymology', 'Globins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'RNA Nucleotidyltransferases/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/*biosynthesis', 'RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects']",1987/07/01 00:00,1987/07/01 00:01,['1987/07/01 00:00'],"['1987/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Cell Biol. 1987 Jul;105(1):137-43. doi: 10.1083/jcb.105.1.137.,['R01-CA33953/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['10.1083/jcb.105.1.137 [doi]'],,PMC2114878,,,,

Northern blot analysis shows that mouse ferritin H and L mRNAs each contain approximately 1.1 kilobases. The levels of both mRNAs increase after addition of dimethyl sulfoxide in a biphasic manner. After a sharp rise in the first 6 h, the levels decline and then rise again over the next 90 h. These increases in mRNA levels reflect increased transcription of both mRNAs. Analysis of ferritin subunit synthesis surprisingly showed no corresponding increase in the rate of protein synthesis, suggesting that the additional mRNA was not in functional polysomes. These studies also indicated a novel processing of mouse ferritin H subunits. H subunits appear to be synthesized as a precursor of approximately 22,500. This form is not present in mature shells.

Peripheral blood lymphocyte from all three patients were evaluated for lymphocyte morphology, natural killer (NK) function, and surface marker expression. In addition, two-color flow cytometric analysis was performed to determine the phenotype of the CD-16+ cells. Our findings indicate that the presence of increased numbers of CD-16+ cells alone is not a good predictor of NK activity. However, we observed a differential expression of the HLA class II molecules DR and DQ on the CD-16+ cells obtained from these patients that was associated with NK function. Hence, a CD-16+, Leu-7-, Leu-19+ (NKH-1A) and HLA class II+ phenotype did correlate with NK function in contrast to a CD-16+, Leu-7+, Leu-19- (NKH-1A) and HLA class II- phenotype. Of importance was the fact that the CD-16+, HLA class II+ cells did not express CD-25 or TFR, nor did they mediate cytotoxicity against solid tumor targets, suggesting that these CD-16+ cells are not activated. Thus, in contrast to previous studies of NK ontogeny that utilized in vitro activated NK cells, studies of patients with CD-16+ lymphoproliferative disorders may provide an alternative approach for examining NK differentiation.","['Bray, R A', 'Gottschalk, L R', 'Landay, A L', 'Gebel, H M']","['Bray RA', 'Gottschalk LR', 'Landay AL', 'Gebel HM']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Hum Immunol,Human immunology,8010936,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (HLA-DQ Antigens)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, Surface/*analysis', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HLA-DQ Antigens/analysis', 'HLA-DR Antigens/analysis', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*immunology', 'Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phenotype']",1987/06/01 00:00,1987/06/01 00:01,['1987/06/01 00:00'],"['1987/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Hum Immunol. 1987 Jun;19(2):105-15. doi: 10.1016/0198-8859(87)90098-x.,,"['0198-8859(87)90098-X [pii]', '10.1016/0198-8859(87)90098-x [doi]']",,,,,,

Marrow erythroid progenitors increased remarkably in these patients. Bone marrow-conditioned medium (BMCM) and sera obtained from these patients revealed high levels of BPA. Serial examination of a typical case showed that BPA in BMCM and sera increased during regenerating hemopoiesis, but decreased when the hemopoiesis stabilized. Adherent cell depletion and treatment with monoclonal antibody (OKM1) reduced BPA production from the bone marrow cells, thereby suggesting that bone marrow macrophages are responsible for the BPA production. Fractionation of pooled BMCM with Amicon Diaflo membranes showed that the BPA was mainly present in the 30,000- to 50,000-dalton fraction. BPA in BMCM was heat labile, inactivated by trypsin and protease, but was not inactivated by neuraminidase. Pooled BMCM did not influence the growth of CFU-E-derived colonies.

It is composed of two polypeptide chains linked by disulfide bonds. The B-chain is encoded by the c-sis proto-oncogene, which is expressed in several malignant and non-malignant cells including K562 cells differentiating towards megakaryoblasts. Expression of the A-chain has been reported to occur in human solid tumor cell lines independently of c-sis expression. We report here the non-coordinate expression of the A- and B-chains in human leukemia cell lines. The PDGF-A and B-chain (c-sis) RNA expression as well as secretion of PDGF polypeptides are induced in the K562 cell line upon induction of megakaryoblastic differentiation with 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate (TPA) whereas erythroid differentiation induced with sodium butyrate is accompanied by c-sis expression only. Simultaneously with megakaryoblastic differentiation the RNA level for another platelet protein, the transforming growth factor-beta was also increased, but in a complex manner. The promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL-60 does not express PDGF-A RNA, whereas the promonocytic cell line U937 does. Preferential induction of the A-chain RNA is obtained in both cell lines after treatment with TPA which causes monocytic differentiation. PDGF-A expression in HL-60 cells is also observed after treatment with the tumor necrosis factor-alpha but granulocytic differentiation of HL-60 cells induced with dimethyl sulfoxide or the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor is not associated with PDGF gene expression.","['Alitalo, R', 'Andersson, L C', 'Betsholtz, C', 'Nilsson, K', 'Westermark, B', 'Heldin, C H', 'Alitalo, K']","['Alitalo R', 'Andersson LC', 'Betsholtz C', 'Nilsson K', 'Westermark B', 'Heldin CH', 'Alitalo K']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,"['0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Platelet-Derived Growth Factor)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', '*Gene Expression Regulation', '*Genes', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Megakaryocytes/*cytology', 'Monocytes/*cytology', 'Platelet-Derived Growth Factor/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics']",1987/05/01 00:00,1987/05/01 00:01,['1987/05/01 00:00'],"['1987/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,EMBO J. 1987 May;6(5):1213-8.,,,,PMC553921,,,,

In the absence of transferrin, HL60 cells incorporated about 1% of the 67Ga dose over 6 h. The presence of transferrin increased cellular 67Ga uptake approximately 10-fold. Transferrin-mediated uptake of 67Ga was blocked by an anti-transferrin receptor monoclonal antibody, and decreases in the density of cellular transferrin receptors led to corresponding decreases in the transferrin-dependent uptake of 67Ga. Changes in the cellular ferritin content did not significantly influence the uptake of 67Ga by either transferrin-independent or transferrin-dependent pathways. Regardless of the mechanism of uptake, a significant amount of intracellular 67Ga was found to be associated with immunoprecipitable ferritin as well as with a free pool. This free intracellular 67Ga appeared to be kinetically active since cells released 67Ga back to the media over time. Our results demonstrate the existence of a dual mechanism for the cellular uptake of 67Ga and suggest that the preferential uptake of 67Ga by lymphomas is related to the high density of transferrin receptors known to be expressed by these tumors in vivo.","['Chitambar, C R', 'Zivkovic, Z']","['Chitambar CR', 'Zivkovic Z']",,['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Gallium Radioisotopes)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', '0 (Transferrin)', '9007-73-2 (Ferritins)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Cell Compartmentation', 'Cell Line', 'Ferritins/metabolism', 'Gallium Radioisotopes/*metabolism', 'Iron/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Transferrin/immunology/*metabolism', 'Transferrin/metabolism/*pharmacology']",1987/08/01 00:00,1987/08/01 00:01,['1987/08/01 00:00'],"['1987/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1987 Aug 1;47(15):3929-34.,['CA 41740-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,

The defective chromosome #8 contained an expanded chromosomal segment at the end of the long arm at band q24. The segment appeared to be a homogeneously staining region on the basis of quinacrine fluorescence banding. Using G-banding technique, this segment showed some evidence of indistinct aberrant bands and, thus, was designated an abnormally banded region (ABR). Double minute chromosomes (DM) were not seen in these cells. The second subline showed a similar karyotype; however, these cells lacked the 8q+ marker and contained one to 37 DM in approximately 90% of the cells examined. Because HL-60 cells are known to contain multiple copies of the c-myc oncogene, in situ chromosomal hybridization of a c-myc probe to HL-60 metaphase cells was performed to localize the amplified genes. The hybridization studies revealed localization to the ABR, as well as to DM, which is consistent with amplification of c-myc within these novel interchangeable chromosomal aberrations.","['Misawa, S', 'Staal, S P', 'Testa, J R']","['Misawa S', 'Staal SP', 'Testa JR']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,,IM,"['Cell Line', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Banding', 'Chromosome Mapping', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8', '*Gene Amplification', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', '*Proto-Oncogenes']",1987/09/01 00:00,1987/09/01 00:01,['1987/09/01 00:00'],"['1987/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 1987 Sep;28(1):127-35. doi: 10.1016/0165-4608(87)90362-1.,['1P50 CA 32107/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['0165-4608(87)90362-1 [pii]', '10.1016/0165-4608(87)90362-1 [doi]']",,,,,,

In our series ACA were rare (five of 28 patients) and simple (four of five) in CP. They were much more frequent and complex in AP (11 of 16) and in BT (22 of 24) with complex abnormalities (13 of 24). In CP, ACA predictive value for metamorphosis was poor: only three of 13 patients had ACA within 1 year before BT, and only two of 11 within 1 year before AP. ACA were mainly observed during the last period before BT: ten of 17 patients studied within 6 months prior BT had ACA, but by then two of three were in AP.

These studies show that, unlike normal human PMN, chemotactic peptides can cause an intracellular biochemical change that is not associated with a chemokinetic response in induced HL-60 cells.

Culture outcomes were extremely variable, ranging from lack of appearance of differentiated cells to complete disappearance of blasts with replacement by mature cells. In 50 cases an increase (25-185%) in the absolute number of differentiated cells in culture was noted during the culture period. Full differentiation was seen exclusively in cultures from 13/48 (27.1%) patients studied at diagnosis, as compared to 0/20 patients studied at relapse (P less than 0.01). The ability to fully or partially differentiate in culture was lost to a significant degree at relapse (13/20 patients) as compared to diagnosis (48/48 patients, P = 0.0001).

We propose that the pathophysiology of acral lividosis in CML involves occlusion of small blood vessels of the skin by large, nondeformable myeloblasts, a process that has been shown histologically to occur in other organs in patients with CML. This process, called leukostasis, occurs in patients with CML who have over 50.0 X 10(9)/L (50,000/mm3) circulating myeloblasts. Patients manifest cardiorespiratory and central nervous system compromise, a clinical constellation known as the hyperleukocytosis syndrome.

During this induced differentiation, a certain type of sequentially programmed gene expression and repression appears to occur in addition to the induction of globin mRNA. This system provides a commitment model for erythrodifferentiation and decancerization. By transfection of a beta-globin/TK chimeric gene into a B8/3 cell line, we examined the regulatory factors controlling beta-globin gene expression. Our results suggested that the timing of the appearance of inducible, positive trans-acting factor (s) and activation of chromatin conformation occur during induction. We demonstrated that a novel MEL cell line, TSA 8, could be induced to be committed to CFU-E, an erythropoietin-mediated progenitor cell, with the addition of DMSO. In the commitment process, we observed an asymmetric cell division, which could explain the self-renewal and the commitment of multipotential hemopoietic stem cells.

Three types of discrepancies were observed: cases with typical morphologic characteristics and cytochemistry but devoid of lineage-specific antigens; these mainly include poorly differentiated leukemias (eight M1, four M2, and eight M5a), suggesting that the cytochemical enzymes are earlier myeloid markers than the currently available monoclonal antibodies; cases in which immunologic characteristics were discordant with morphologic characteristics and cytochemistry; these include two M2 cases positive for monocytic monoclonal antibodies (CD14); six M5b cases positive for granulocytic monoclonal antibodies (CD15); and seven M4 cases lacking in CD14 or CD15 antigens; cases with discrepancies between morphologic characteristics and cytochemistry and in which the immunologic markers permitted the correct assessment of cell lineage (six cases).

Entomophthoromycosis describes another disease caused by Zycomycetes, but of the order Entophthorales. In contrast to mucormycosis, entomophthoromycosis is not associated with underlying disease. Vascular invasion by the hyphae does not occur, and the hyphae are surrounded by eosinophilic sheathes. These sheathes are regarded as one form of the Splendore-Hoeppli phenomenon. The authors report an unusual case of mucormycosis in a severely pancytopenic patient dying of acute myelogenous leukemia. At autopsy, eosinophilic sheathes with radiating fibrils were seen about intravascular hyphae, simulating entomophthoromycosis.

We determined the effect of these mycotoxins on the growth and differentiation of the human acute promyelocytic leukemia (HL-60) cell line. Sixteen natural and semisynthetic trichothecenes were tested at concentrations of 0.2-60,000 ng/ml. The cytotoxicity exerted by these compounds varied: e.g., roridin A was found to be toxic at 1 ng/ml, whereas T-2 palmitate was not toxic even at 1 microgram/ml. These compounds varied also in their potential to induce differentiation: 9,10-epoxy T-2 toxin and T-2 toxin induced differentiation at concentrations of 2-5 ng/ml, while 9,10-dihydro T-2 toxin was effective only at 100 ng/ml. Other trichothecenes (e.g., verrucarin A and verrucarol) did not induce differentiation at either subtoxic or toxic concentrations. Cell differentiation was always associated with cytotoxicity; optimal concentrations for induction of differentiation were usually 30-60% of the toxic concentrations. The HL-60 cell population was found to be heterogenous with respect to the ability to differentiate in response to trichothecenes, while in some clones up to 70% of the cells underwent differentiation, and other clones were completely resistant. The latter clones could, however, be induced to differentiate by other agents such as retinoic acid, dimethyl sulfoxide and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate.

The mechanism of action of HMBA is not known. In this study we provide evidence that protein kinase C has a role in inducer-mediated MEL cell differentiation: (i) HMBA induces the formation of a soluble, proteolytically activated form of protein kinase C that is catalytically active in the absence of Ca2+ and phospholipid; (ii) the protease inhibitor leupeptin blocks formation of this activated form of the kinase and inhibits HMBA-induced MEL cell hemoglobin accumulation; (iii) phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) inhibits HMBA-induced MEL differentiation and causes depletion of total protein kinase C activity; (iv) MEL cells depleted in protein kinase C activity by culture with PMA are resistant to induction by HMBA; (v) upon removal of PMA, restoration of MEL cell sensitivity to HMBA is correlated with reaccumulation of protein kinase C activity; and (vi) MEL cells grown to density arrest are both depleted of protein kinase C activity and resistant to HMBA. Together, these results suggest that HMBA-mediated MEL cell differentiation involves a protein kinase C-related mechanism and the proteolytically activated form of the kinase, which does not require Ca2+ or phospholipid for its catalytic activity.","['Melloni, E', 'Pontremoli, S', 'Michetti, M', 'Sacco, O', 'Cakiroglu, A G', 'Jackson, J F', 'Rifkind, R A', 'Marks, P A']","['Melloni E', 'Pontremoli S', 'Michetti M', 'Sacco O', 'Cakiroglu AG', 'Jackson JF', 'Rifkind RA', 'Marks PA']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Acetamides)', '0 (Hemoglobins)', '0 (Leupeptins)', '0 (Phospholipids)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'J97339NR3V (leupeptin)', 'LA133J59VU (hexamethylene bisacetamide)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Acetamides/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Hemoglobins/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*enzymology/pathology', 'Leupeptins/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Phospholipids/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C/*metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology']",1987/08/01 00:00,1987/08/01 00:01,['1987/08/01 00:00'],"['1987/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1987 Aug;84(15):5282-6. doi: 10.1073/pnas.84.15.5282.,"['P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-31768/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-08748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['10.1073/pnas.84.15.5282 [doi]'],,PMC298839,,,,

Another variant, MF-MuLV, which contains the long terminal repeat of Friend MuLV and causes erythroid leukemia instead of T-cell lymphoma, also induced the preleukemic hyperplasia.

Although cell growth in the two systems was correlated (r = 0.74, p less than 0.0001), there was increased formation and size of clusters and colonies in AG/F, suggesting that the clonogenic cells from children with AML are more readily assayed in AG/F. The number and size of clones in either system did not show a relationship to the morphologic subtype of leukemia. Depending on the scoring system used, increased growth in MC/P was related to abnormal karyotype. Also dependent on scoring system, the ability of leukemic cells to form small clusters in AG/F was associated with resistance to induction therapy: cells of patients with resistant disease were more likely to produce small clusters (p = 0.02). Our results suggest that clonogenic cells from children with AML grow more readily in AG/F than in MC/P, but that neither culture system supports the growth of cells from all patients.

In addition, uracil-DNA glycosylase activities were determined in nine human leukemia/lymphoma cell lines. There was a clear correlation between the percentage of blast cells and the enzyme activity when mononuclear cell fractions from patient samples were analysed. The following uracil-DNA glycosylase activities were recorded (mean +/- S.D., number of samples): ALL = 45.6 +/- 14.8 U/mg of protein, N = 10; ANLL = 41.1 +/- 13.8 U/mg of protein, N = 22; CGL (blast crisis) = 44.7 U/mg of protein. The uracil-DNA glycosylase activity in nine human leukemia/lymphoma cell lines ranged from 35.2 to 66.0 U/mg of protein, and no striking differences were observed between the T-ALL, B-ALL, null cell ALL or myeloid lines. Similarly, the various biological features, such as the common ALL surface antigen, the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase enzyme, the sub-type of leukemia, chromosomal aberrations, or previous chemotherapy, did not apparently affect the expression of uracil-DNA glycosylase. We propose that the integrity of the genetic information is well protected by uracil-DNA glycosylase in different forms of leukemia, including cases with a low proportion of S-phase blasts, as assessed by flow cytometry in the present work. When compared to the activities in benign hematopoietic progenitor cells, studied previously in this laboratory, no big differences between the benign and malignant hematopoiesis were demonstrated. Hence, it is unlikely that selectivity of chemotherapy towards malignant vs benign hematopoietic growth could be based on the enzyme uracil-DNA glycosylase.","['Koistinen, P', 'Eerola, E', 'Vilpo, J A']","['Koistinen P', 'Eerola E', 'Vilpo JA']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['EC 3.2.2.- (DNA Glycosylases)', 'EC 3.2.2.- (N-Glycosyl Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.2.2.- (Uracil-DNA Glycosidase)']",IM,"['Cell Line', '*DNA Glycosylases', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia/*enzymology/genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/enzymology/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/enzymology/genetics', 'N-Glycosyl Hydrolases/*metabolism', 'Uracil-DNA Glycosidase']",1987/01/01 00:00,1987/01/01 00:01,['1987/01/01 00:00'],"['1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1987;11(6):557-63. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(87)90092-0.,,['10.1016/0145-2126(87)90092-0 [doi]'],,,,,,

A new in vitro cell line (LLAK) was derived from LL and compared to LLTC in its growth properties and sensitivity to tiazofurin. LLAK resembled the in vivo tumor in having both a high S-phase fraction and a high rate of cell death at high cell density. In continuous drug exposure growth inhibition assays, the concentration of tiazofurin required to reduce the number of cells in a culture by 50% with respect to control cultures was 0.51 microM for LLAK, 2.6 microM for LLTC, and greater than 10 microM for a range of human cancer cell lines. In cytotoxicity assays involving a 2-hour drug exposure followed by clonogenic assay, tiazofurin was more toxic to LLAK cells than to LLTC cells or L1210 murine leukemia cells, consistent with its high in vivo activity against LL. MM-96 human melanoma cells were highly resistant. Flow cytometry studies indicated that tiazofurin selectively depleted the LLAK cell population of S- and G2-phase cells. In one experiment involving 16 consecutive in vitro passages of LLAK in the absence of tiazofurin, a new line emerged that was resistant to tiazofurin in the clonogenic assay. The results demonstrate the spontaneous emergence of resistance from a tiazofurin-sensitive cell line. If similar processes occur during adaptation of human tumor cells to culture, this may explain the finding of low activity of tiazofurin toward a range of human tumor cell lines.","['Finlay, G J', 'Ching, L M', 'Wilson, W R', 'Baguley, B C']","['Finlay GJ', 'Ching LM', 'Wilson WR', 'Baguley BC']",,['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,"['0 (Ribonucleosides)', '49717AWG6K (Ribavirin)', 'ULJ82834RE (tiazofurin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Clone Cells/drug effects', '*Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Drug Resistance', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Ribavirin/analogs & derivatives/*therapeutic use', 'Ribonucleosides/*therapeutic use', '*Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",1987/08/01 00:00,1987/08/01 00:01,['1987/08/01 00:00'],"['1987/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1987 Aug;79(2):291-6.,,,,,,,,

Advantage was taken of this property to separate physically a population of cells highly enriched in macrophage-like forms. When these differentiated cells were placed in culture medium free of 1,25(OH)2D3, there was a rapid reversal of the features of the differentiated phenotype, monitored by the loss of alpha-naphthyl butyrate esterase activity and the loss of adherence to the substrate. The reversal was accompanied by the resumption of normal rates of DNA synthesis, mitosis, and reaccumulation of c-myc and c-myb transcripts. The levels of transcripts of oncogenes c-fos and c-fms, which became abundant in the phenotypically differentiated cultures, declined along with the loss of adhesiveness and reversion to more primitive myeloblastic forms. These changes in proto-oncogene expression became evident before cell proliferation resumed, thereby excluding the diluting effect of the outgrowth of undifferentiated cells. It is concluded that in this system there is no firm commitment to terminal, as opposed to early, differentiation in the great majority of the cells and that the expression of the monocytic maturation-associated genes c-fos and c-fms is down-regulated when macrophage-like cells dedifferentiate. This strengthens the case for an association between macrophage differentiation and the expression of oncogenes c-fos and c-fms.","['Studzinski, G P', 'Brelvi, Z S']","['Studzinski GP', 'Brelvi ZS']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,"['0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']",IM,"['Calcitriol/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Replication', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics', 'Macrophages/cytology/*drug effects/ultrastructure', 'Monocytes/cytology/*ultrastructure', 'Phenotype', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', '*Proto-Oncogenes']",1987/07/01 00:00,1987/07/01 00:01,['1987/07/01 00:00'],"['1987/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1987 Jul;79(1):67-76.,['CA-44722/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,

We found that variants isolated at various passages in Friend erythroleukemia cells persistently infected with vaccinia virus contained, in addition to an 8-megadalton (MDa) deletion on the left terminus of the viral genome, major alterations in the sizes of three structural proteins with molecular masses of about 39, 21, and 14 kDa. Alterations in isoelectric points were also observed in proteins of 48, 27, and 14 kDa. The 14-kDa protein is part of the virus envelope, and the variants increased the size of this protein from 0.5 to 3 kDa with increasing passage number. Alteration in size of the 14-kDa protein is a dominant trait since it appeared in the whole virus population by passage 48. With more passages, some variants were found to increase or decrease the size of a 39-kDa core protein by about 2 kDa and to decrease the size of an envelope protein of 21 kDa by about 2 kDa. These three proteins were immunogenic in mice and elicited a strong host immune response. Major alterations in the sizes of these proteins were prevented by continuous treatment of the persistently infected cultures with interferon. However, after interferon was removed, protein modifications appeared with increasing passage number. Generation of the 8-MDa deletion and alterations in the size of the 14-kDa protein correlated with a marked decrease in virulence of these variants. Our findings suggest that during virus persistence, specific mutations are introduced in the vaccinia virus genome that lead to protein alterations and to highly attenuated viruses.","['Paez, E', 'Dallo, S', 'Esteban, M']","['Paez E', 'Dallo S', 'Esteban M']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Viral Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Viral/analysis', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA, Viral/genetics', 'Genes, Viral', 'Isoelectric Point', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/microbiology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Weight', 'Mutation', 'Time Factors', 'Vaccinia/*microbiology', 'Vaccinia virus/*pathogenicity/physiology', 'Viral Proteins/immunology/*physiology']",1987/08/01 00:00,1987/08/01 00:01,['1987/08/01 00:00'],"['1987/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1987 Aug;61(8):2642-7. doi: 10.1128/JVI.61.8.2642-2647.1987.,['CA 44262/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['10.1128/JVI.61.8.2642-2647.1987 [doi]'],,PMC255716,,,,

It was also demonstrated that the plasmid genome was stably integrated into the chromosomal DNA of G418-resistant K562 cells. Our results proved that protoplast fusion could be used to study the specific expression and the biologic activities of cloned genes in human hematopoietic cells.","['Tsao, C J', 'Hosoi, T', 'Hirai, H', 'Saito, T', 'Okabe, T', 'Urabe, A', 'Takaku, F']","['Tsao CJ', 'Hosoi T', 'Hirai H', 'Saito T', 'Okabe T', 'Urabe A', 'Takaku F']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cell Cloning,International journal of cell cloning,8308172,"['EC 2.3.1.- (Acetyltransferases)', 'EC 2.3.1.28 (Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase)', 'I16QD7X297 (Neomycin)']",IM,"['Acetyltransferases/genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase', 'Drug Resistance', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/genetics/pathology', 'Membrane Fusion', 'Neomycin/pharmacology', 'Recombination, Genetic', '*Transfection']",1987/05/01 00:00,1987/05/01 00:01,['1987/05/01 00:00'],"['1987/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Cell Cloning. 1987 May;5(3):220-30. doi: 10.1002/stem.5530050306.,,['10.1002/stem.5530050306 [doi]'],,,,,,

To determine internalization, a high-salt acid wash was performed. Internalization of 125I-Epo was found in TSA8 cells as well as in fetal mouse liver cells (FMLC), although the percentage of internalized radioactivity reached 40% after incubation at 37 degrees C for 150 min and was lower than that in FMLC. Exposure of TSA8 cells to unlabeled Epo resulted in a rapid, time-dependent reduction in 125I-Epo binding activity. The net loss of the activity was related to the ambient Epo concentration and 5 X 10(-8)M Epo induced approximately 80% loss of total binding capacity. Scatchard analysis of the binding data revealed that the high-affinity receptor number was decreased but the affinity was increased in the Epo-treated cells. In low-affinity receptors, however, the receptor affinity was decreased and the receptor number was not changed much by preincubation with Epo. These results suggest that the decrease in 125I-Epo binding activity after preincubation with unlabeled Epo is mainly accounted for by a decrease in the number of high-affinity receptors, and the high-affinity receptors play an important role in the biological response to Epo.","['Fukamachi, H', 'Tojo, A', 'Saito, T', 'Kitamura, T', 'Nakata, M', 'Urabe, A', 'Takaku, F']","['Fukamachi H', 'Tojo A', 'Saito T', 'Kitamura T', 'Nakata M', 'Urabe A', 'Takaku F']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cell Cloning,International journal of cell cloning,8308172,"['0 (Ligands)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell Line', 'Endocytosis', 'Erythropoietin/*metabolism', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Ligands', 'Mice']",1987/05/01 00:00,1987/05/01 00:01,['1987/05/01 00:00'],"['1987/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Cell Cloning. 1987 May;5(3):209-19. doi: 10.1002/stem.5530050305.,,['10.1002/stem.5530050305 [doi]'],,,,,,

Initial velocities were measured at room temperature by means of inhibitor-stop and oil-stop assays. MeSAdo influx was strongly inhibited by Ado, dAdo, and nucleoside transport inhibitors including nitrobenzylthioinosine and dipyridamole. Ade was inhibitory only at concentrations in excess of 1 mM. Loss of nucleoside transport capacity during differentiation of HL-60 cells was accompanied by a corresponding decrease in MeSAdo influx rates. These results indicate that MeSAdo influx was mediated by the nonspecific nucleoside transport system. The kinetic data were consistent with a single saturable carrier and yielded Km values of 74 and 184 microM and Vmax values of 424 and 48 pmols/10(6) cells/min with HL-60 cells and erythrocytes, respectively, after correction for a substantial passive diffusion component, which accounted for over 50% of the influx of 1 mM MeSAdo. The passive diffusion of MeSAdo in the presence of a transport inhibitor was not rate-limiting for the salvage of 50 microM MeSAdo to methionine when HL-60 cells were cultured in methionine-deficient medium. The large contribution of passive diffusion to the influx of MeSAdo is consistent with its unusually high octanol/water partition ratio (5.7-fold greater than that of Ado).","['Stoeckler, J D', 'Li, S Y']","['Stoeckler JD', 'Li SY']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Deoxyadenosines)', '0 (Thionucleosides)', '0 (Vasodilator Agents)', ""634Z2VK3UQ (5'-methylthioadenosine)"", 'K72T3FS567 (Adenosine)']",IM,"['Adenosine/*analogs & derivatives/blood/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Cell Line', '*Deoxyadenosines', 'Erythrocytes/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Thionucleosides/blood/*metabolism', 'Vasodilator Agents/pharmacology']",1987/07/15 00:00,1987/07/15 00:01,['1987/07/15 00:00'],"['1987/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1987/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1987 Jul 15;262(20):9542-6.,"['CA 07340/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 13943/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 37901/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['S0021-9258(18)47967-7 [pii]'],,,,,,

Increases in the weekly dose of MTX resulted in proportional increases in the neutrophil MTX. In half the cases the ANC was less than 1.5 X 10(9)/l. The ANC was not related to the weekly MTX dose or the daily 6-MP dose. In children with ANC greater than 1.5 X 10(9)/l there was a significant inverse correlation between the ANC and the neutrophil MTX (r = -0.71, P less than 0.01), which was not found in the group of children with ANC less than 1.5 X 10(9)/l. These findings may be explained by differences in the kinetics of the granulopoiesis between children with high and children with low neutrophil counts.","['Schroder, H']",['Schroder H'],,['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/metabolism', 'Cell Separation', 'Child', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/blood/*metabolism', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Mercaptopurine/administration & dosage', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage/*metabolism', 'Neutropenia/metabolism', 'Neutrophils/*metabolism', 'Statistics as Topic']",1987/01/01 00:00,1987/01/01 00:01,['1987/01/01 00:00'],"['1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 1987;19(4):339-42. doi: 10.1007/BF00261485.,,['10.1007/BF00261485 [doi]'],,,,,,

Selective examination of volumes of tibial marrow (1 cm3) by 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy confirmed marked differences in the 1H spectra of marrow from these patients. Increases in the H2O peak of the 1H spectra were correlated with infiltration of blast cells and lack of control of the neoplastic disease.

In this paper, we show that while MTA inhibits the growth of the human promyelocytic cell line HL-60, it does not interfere with retinoic acid-induced granulocytic or phorbol ester-induced monocytic differentiation of these cells. MTA also inhibits proliferation induced by colony stimulating activity of normal human granulocytic precursor cells grown in suspension culture but does not suppress terminal differentiation of these cells. In contrast to the lack of effect of MTA on granulocytic differentiation which we report here, others have shown that MTA prevents terminal differentiation of murine erythroleukemia cells. That MTA is a normal cellular constituent which inhibits proliferation but not differentiation of normal granulopoietic cells and may have opposing effects on immature cells of erythroid lineage suggests a possible role for this compound in the regulation of hematopoiesis. In addition, MTA may be useful for studying the process of differentiation in the absence of cell proliferation in granulopoietic cells.","['Riscoe, M K', 'Schwamborn, J', 'Ferro, A J', 'Olson, K D', 'Fitchen, J H']","['Riscoe MK', 'Schwamborn J', 'Ferro AJ', 'Olson KD', 'Fitchen JH']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Deoxyadenosines)', '0 (Thionucleosides)', '2FZ7Y3VOQX (Spermine)', ""634Z2VK3UQ (5'-methylthioadenosine)"", 'K72T3FS567 (Adenosine)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'U87FK77H25 (Spermidine)']",IM,"['Adenosine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', '*Deoxyadenosines', 'Granulocytes/cytology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Macrophages/cytology', 'Spermidine/pharmacology', 'Spermine/pharmacology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Thionucleosides/*pharmacology']",1987/07/15 00:00,1987/07/15 00:01,['1987/07/15 00:00'],"['1987/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1987/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1987 Jul 15;47(14):3830-4.,,,,,,,,

The increased cytotoxic potency of the two derivatives reflects at least in part the enhanced drug accumulation by cells that results from their increased lipophilicity. However, the level of protein-linked DNA breaks was not directly related to cellular accumulation of drug analogues. It is possible that enhanced cytotoxicity may also be the consequence of the greatly enhanced ability of analogues to cause DNA strand breaks. The resistant line showed only a modest degree of resistance to both anthracycline derivatives compared with the high degree of resistance to doxorubicin. Although for all the anthracyclines tested drug accumulation was reduced in the resistant line, this did not correlate with the degree of resistance. A differential sensitivity of resistant and parental cell lines to DNA cleavage activity was consistently found for all three drugs tested. However, in contrast to a lack of effect of doxorubicin, the derivatives caused appreciable DNA strand breakage in resistant cells. The enhanced ability of these analogues to break DNA in resistant cells is consistent with the slight cross-resistance with doxorubicin. DNA double-strand breaks produced in isolated nuclei from these cells paralleled the pattern found in whole cells, thus indicating that a nuclear alteration, presumably involving DNA topoisomerases, is associated with anthracycline resistance. Our findings strongly support the hypothesis that anthracycline resistance in these cell variants may be mediated by multiple mechanisms, involving alterations of plasma membrane and changes of nuclear enzymatic activities responsible for DNA strand breaks.","['Capranico, G', 'Riva, A', 'Tinelli, S', 'Dasdia, T', 'Zunino, F']","['Capranico G', 'Riva A', 'Tinelli S', 'Dasdia T', 'Zunino F']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Naphthacenes)', ""65JH75I9JX (4'-deoxy-4'-iododoxorubicin)"", '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/drug effects', 'DNA/*drug effects', 'Daunorubicin/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Doxorubicin/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Idarubicin', 'Leukemia P388/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Naphthacenes/therapeutic use', 'Nucleic Acid Conformation/drug effects']",1987/07/15 00:00,1987/07/15 00:01,['1987/07/15 00:00'],"['1987/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1987/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1987 Jul 15;47(14):3752-6.,,,,,,,,

No significant corresponding decreases were noted in patients with CLL at any time. Significant decreases were also noted over time in the rates of extramedullary site involvement by AML, CGL, and ALL. Whereas the lymphoreticular organs, kidneys, adrenals, and pituitary were most often involved at autopsy by CLL, the testes, leptomeninges, dura mater, uterus, large bowel, and pancreas were most often involved by ALL. In general, patients with AML and CGL showed the lowest relative rates of involvement of the various organs by leukemia during the 24-year period. Whereas patients with AML and ALL showed significant decreases in the rates of involvement of nearly all anatomic sites during the most recent study periods, those with CGL and CLL showed corresponding decreases in only a few organ sites. The lower rates of organ involvement in patients with AML and ALL attest to the more aggressive eradication of leukemic cells by therapeutic regimens in these diseases over time. In particular, the significant decrease in the rate of meningeal involvement by ALL during the most recent period is probably attributable to central nervous system prophylaxis.","['Barcos, M', 'Lane, W', 'Gomez, G A', 'Han, T', 'Freeman, A', 'Preisler, H', 'Henderson, E']","['Barcos M', 'Lane W', 'Gomez GA', 'Han T', 'Freeman A', 'Preisler H', 'Henderson E']",,['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Autopsy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology']",1987/08/15 00:00,1987/08/15 00:01,['1987/08/15 00:00'],"['1987/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1987/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer. 1987 Aug 15;60(4):827-37. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19870815)60:4<827::aid-cncr2820600419>3.0.co;2-a.,,['10.1002/1097-0142(19870815)60:4<827::aid-cncr2820600419>3.0.co;2-a [doi]'],,,,,,

Decreased expression of the c-myc oncogene is linked to growth arrest and terminal cellular differentiation. The present study characterizes the effect of TNF alpha on the regulation of the c-myc gene in HL-60 cells. TNF alpha (100 U/mL) rapidly inhibited messenger RNA (mRNA) accumulation of c-myc with a 50% reduction in less than one hour. Dose-response studies showed that a 50% reduction of c-myc mRNA occurred in the range of 15 U/mL. In vitro nuclear run-on experiments showed that this decrease of c-myc-mRNA accumulation was the result of a reduced rate of transcription of c-myc by TNF alpha. Further studies demonstrated that TNF alpha did not post-transcriptionally alter levels of c-myc mRNA, and the inhibitory action of TNF alpha on c-myc expression in HL-60 cells did not depend on new protein synthesis. In the conditions of all the experiments, TNF alpha did not affect cell viability. By contrast, TNF alpha (500 U/mL) did not decrease mRNA levels of c-myc in an HL-60 variant cell line whose growth was not inhibited by TNF alpha; also TNF alpha (500 U/mL) increased c-myc-mRNA levels in normal fibroblasts whose growth is known to be stimulated by TNF alpha. These findings, in concert with prior studies, show a close association between growth inhibition of HL-60 cells and decreased levels of mRNA coding for c-myc.","['Tobler, A', 'Johnston, D', 'Koeffler, H P']","['Tobler A', 'Johnston D', 'Koeffler HP']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '9004-70-0 (Collodion)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Collodion', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Fibroblasts/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects', 'Glycoproteins/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Oncogenes/*drug effects', 'RNA, Messenger/drug effects', 'Recombinant Proteins/*pharmacology', 'Transcription, Genetic/*drug effects', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha']",1987/07/01 00:00,1987/07/01 00:01,['1987/07/01 00:00'],"['1987/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1987 Jul;70(1):200-5.,"['CA 26038/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 32737/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 33936/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",['S0006-4971(20)78496-X [pii]'],,,,,,

Such a high ""adhesive"" heterogeneity of nuclear RNAs (i.e., variations in the tightness of RNA-protein bonds) appears to be due to the association of nuclear matrix proteins. A direct correlation was found to exist between the metabolic turnover of RNA and the tightness of its association with the nuclear matrix. Actually, the pulse label which rapidly incorporates into the RNAt greater than 50 degrees, the RNA fraction being most tenaciously bound to the matrix, could be chased later into RNAs weakly bound to it. As the RNA-matrix binding weakens, the metabolic and structural properties of a given RNA change, e.g., sedimentation coefficients decrease, while the poly(A)+-RNA content and stability increase. The ""adhesive"" heterogeneity was found to be inherent in not only nuclear RNAs but also in cytoplasmic non-ribosomal RNAs, showing the same correlation, i.e., the tighter the RNA--protein complex, the higher the rate of RNA turnover. Cytoplasmic RNAs which differ in their adhesiveness may fulfil various intracellular functions, since polyribosomal mRNPs and informosomal mRNPs appear to be enriched in tightly and weakly bound RNA fractions, respectively.

However, in about two-thirds of all cases prognosis remains quite variable, with a substantial number of early relapses. This study shows in 118 adult patients who attained complete remission (CR) between 1978 and 1984 that pretreatment serum total lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity was inversely correlated with first CR length. The prognostic value of LDH was higher than that of any other features both in univariable and in multivariable analysis. The value was significant in the whole series as well as in patients who lacked other high risk features. Among non-high risk and low-WBC count cases, patients with LDH less than or equal to 500 U/l had a median first CR duration of 27 months, and a projected 5-year relapse free survival of 36%, versus 9 months and 12% of patients with LDH greater than 500 U/l.

The median age was 36 years. Forty-four (72%) patients entered complete remission (CR); 11 patients received a bone marrow transplantation. The median survival of complete remitters was 26.5 months; the probability of remaining in CR at respectively 1 and 2 years was 75% and 62%. The only factor significantly correlated with the outcome of remission induction, survival and duration of CR was age. Patients less than 30 years fared significantly better than those 30 years or older; no difference in outcome was observed between patients aged 30-50 and those over 50 years. In patients less than 30 years the CR rate was 95%; 75% of them were still alive at 2 years and only one (5%) has relapsed. In contrast, in patients 30 years or older the CR rate was 60% and the median survival only 11.5 months, 50% of the complete remitters in this age group have relapsed. Morbidity from intensive consolidation therapy was considerable; more than 50% of consolidation courses were complicated by high fever, needing urgent admission; only four (3%) courses had a fatal event. It is concluded that intensive consolidation therapy may be considered as a major advance in the treatment of younger patients with AML, while its role in older individuals remains questionable.

The increase in iron uptake after 5 days of induction was not accompanied by a proportional increase in the number of transferrin receptors detected by 125I-labeled Tf binding, resulting in DMSO induced cells taking up iron with the rate of about 26 iron atoms per receptor per hour, compared to 15 atoms in uninduced cells. In agreement with this finding are results of the study of cellular 125I or 59Fe-labeled Tf kinetics. In the induced cells Tf endocytosis and release proceeded with identical rates and all the endocytosed iron was retained inside the cell. Tf release by uninduced cells was slower and a part of internalized 59Fe was released. Hemin inhibits Tf-bound iron uptake by DMSO induced cells but not by the uninduced cells. Correspondingly, addition of hemin had little effect on Tf kinetics in the uninduced cells, while the release of Tf was slower in hemin-treated DMSO induced cells. Different efficiency of iron release from internalized Tf, accompanied by changes in cellular Tf kinetics is therefore proposed as a factor determining the rate of iron uptake by developing erythroid cells.","['Hradilek, A', 'Neuwirt, J']","['Hradilek A', 'Neuwirt J']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Biomed Biochim Acta,Biomedica biochimica acta,8304435,"['0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', '0 (Transferrin)', '743LRP9S7N (Hemin)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biological Transport, Active', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Endocytosis', 'Hemin/pharmacology', 'Iron/*metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Receptors, Transferrin/metabolism', 'Transferrin/*metabolism']",1987/01/01 00:00,1987/01/01 00:01,['1987/01/01 00:00'],"['1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biomed Biochim Acta. 1987;46(2-3):S141-5.,,,,,,,,

The cases were encountered in a combined series of 2,529 FNA breast biopsies, of which 666 were malignant; the metastatic neoplasms of the breast thus constituted 2.7% of all the malignant breast tumors. The series consists of 15 women and 3 men, with a mean age of 48 years (range of 11 to 73 years). Sixteen biopsies confirmed metastatic malignancy in patients with known extramammary primaries; the prebiopsy clinical diagnoses in six of the patients were benign breast lesions. In eight patients, the clinical differential diagnosis was either a benign or malignant primary breast lesion versus a metastatic malignancy. In two additional patients, the FNA biopsy identified metastatic neoplasms from unsuspected extramammary primaries. The metastatic neoplasms included three small-cell carcinomas of the lung, one squamous-cell carcinoma of the lung, two malignant melanomas, three ovarian malignancies, including a dysgerminoma, and one each of carcinoma of the fallopian tube, endometrial carcinoma, transitional-cell carcinoma of the urinary bladder, prostatic carcinoma, acute granulocytic leukemia, lymphoma, mycosis fungoides, hepatoma and neuroblastoma of the retroperitoneum. Recognition of unusual cytologic patterns raised the suspicion of, or confirmed the diagnosis of, malignancy in all cases, with no false-negative diagnoses. None of the cases were cytologically interpreted as a primary breast malignancy. Ancillary studies performed on the FNA material, including immunocytochemistry, contributed to a definitive diagnosis in three cases. FNA diagnosis of metastatic malignancy of the breast is essential in order to avoid unnecessary mastectomy and to ensure appropriate chemotherapy and/or irradiation treatment.","['Silverman, J F', 'Feldman, P S', 'Covell, J L', 'Frable, W J']","['Silverman JF', 'Feldman PS', 'Covell JL', 'Frable WJ']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Acta Cytol,Acta cytologica,0370307,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', '*Biopsy, Needle', 'Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis/*secondary/therapy', 'Child', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Histocytochemistry', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/pathology', 'Male', 'Melanoma/pathology', 'Middle Aged']",1987/05/01 00:00,1987/05/01 00:01,['1987/05/01 00:00'],"['1987/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Acta Cytol. 1987 May-Jun;31(3):291-300.,,,,,,,,

In the M4 and M5 subgroups the stimulated leukemic cells showed a significant increase in the production of PCA compared with freshly isolated cells. No evident PCA was documented in M1 and M2 AML as well as in the majority of acute lymphoid leukemias tested, both before and after endotoxin stimulation. The myeloid and lymphoid leukemic cells appear to behave similarly to normal leucocytes, within which only monocyte/macrophages are capable of producing PCA following endotoxin stimulation. These findings suggest that in human leukemic cells the endotoxin-induced production of PCA may be considered a indicator of monocyte/macrophage differentiation and thus represent a valuable diagnostic tool in the classification of acute leukemias.","['Guarini, A', 'Gugliotta, L', 'Catani, L', 'Chetti, L', 'Macchi, S', 'Tura, S']","['Guarini A', 'Gugliotta L', 'Catani L', 'Chetti L', 'Macchi S', 'Tura S']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Thromb Res,Thrombosis research,0326377,"['0 (Blood Coagulation Factors)', '0 (Endotoxins)', '0 (leukocyte procoagulant activity)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', '*Blood Coagulation Factors/metabolism', 'Endotoxins/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/*classification/diagnosis', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid', 'Leukocytes/drug effects/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Monocytes/growth & development/metabolism']",1987/03/01 00:00,1987/03/01 00:01,['1987/03/01 00:00'],"['1987/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Thromb Res. 1987 Mar 1;45(5):545-52. doi: 10.1016/0049-3848(87)90317-3.,,"['0049-3848(87)90317-3 [pii]', '10.1016/0049-3848(87)90317-3 [doi]']",,,,,,

All patients had received a standardized first-line therapy according to the corresponding multicenter trials of the German AML and ALL cooperative groups and were considered refractory to conventional treatment. Therapy consisted of HD-ara-C 3 g/m2 every 12 hours on days 1 to 4; mitoxantrone was started at 12 mg/m2/d on days 3, 4, and 5 and was escalated to four and five doses of 10 mg/m2/d on days 2 to 5 and 2 to 6. From the 44 patients with AML, 24 (54%) achieved a complete remission, two a partial remission, and five were nonresponders. Thirteen patients died of infections (n = 11), pericardiac effusion, or acute cardiomyopathy. In refractory ALL, seven of 11 patients (64%) went into a complete remission, one patient was resistant, and three patients were early deaths. Nonhematologic side effects consisted predominantly of nausea and vomiting, mucositis, and diarrhea. More severe CNS symptoms were encountered during five treatment courses. The median time to complete remission was 36 days. Excluding five patients who underwent bone marrow transplantations, the median remission duration was 4.5 months in AML and 2.3 months in ALL. The median survival time was three months for all patients and nine months for responders only. These data emphasize a high antileukemic activity of HAM in refractory AML and ALL and support the incorporation of the HAM regimen into first-line treatment.","['Hiddemann, W', 'Kreutzmann, H', 'Straif, K', 'Ludwig, W D', 'Mertelsmann, R', 'Planker, M', 'Donhuijsen-Ant, R', 'Lengfelder, E', 'Arlin, Z', 'Buchner, T']","['Hiddemann W', 'Kreutzmann H', 'Straif K', 'Ludwig WD', 'Mertelsmann R', 'Planker M', 'Donhuijsen-Ant R', 'Lengfelder E', 'Arlin Z', 'Buchner T']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Semin Oncol,Seminars in oncology,0420432,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitoxantrone/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Thioguanine/administration & dosage']",1987/06/01 00:00,1987/06/01 00:01,['1987/06/01 00:00'],"['1987/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Semin Oncol. 1987 Jun;14(2 Suppl 1):73-7.,,['0093-7754(87)90047-9 [pii]'],,,,,,

Cells were exposed to ara-C at different concentrations and for periods of one to 120 hours and continuously. Colony growth (CFU-GM/CFU-E/BFU-E) in semisolid culture was assessed after seven and 14 days. The exposure time to ara-C appeared much more important in colony growth inhibition than the drug concentration. For instance, one-hour exposure to 10(-5) mol/L ara-C appeared not cytotoxic, while cocultivation in the presence of 10(-7) mol/L ara-C resulted in a total inhibition of colony growth. Cell fractionation with use of counterflow centrifugation allowed enrichment in subfractions for cells with different amounts of DNA. The inhibition of the clonogenic potential by ara-C was most pronounced in the cell fractions with the highest proliferation activity. Colony-forming cells, assessed after 14 days of culturing appeared less sensitive for ara-C cytotoxicity than seven-day CFUs. This means that ara-C is more cytotoxic to cycling than noncycling cells because compared to the seven-day colonies, 14-day colonies originate from the more resting, more primitive progenitor cells. The cytotoxicity of ara-C to clonogenic cells appears to be related to the proliferating and the cycling state of the progenitor cells and increases with the time of exposure. This phenomenon may be explained by the fact that ara-C is a cycle-specific drug and by the fact that the probability of cells entering the cell cycle is a time-dependent process. The results of this study indicate that development of more effective antileukemic therapy should not aim so much at very high drug levels but rather at prolonged administration of ara-C.","['Muus, P', 'Haanen, C', 'Raijmakers, R', 'de Witte, T', 'Salden, M', 'Wessels, J']","['Muus P', 'Haanen C', 'Raijmakers R', 'de Witte T', 'Salden M', 'Wessels J']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Semin Oncol,Seminars in oncology,0420432,['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)'],IM,"['Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cytarabine/*administration & dosage', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects/pathology']",1987/06/01 00:00,1987/06/01 00:01,['1987/06/01 00:00'],"['1987/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Semin Oncol. 1987 Jun;14(2 Suppl 1):238-44.,,['0093-7754(87)90071-6 [pii]'],,,,,['Semin Oncol 1987 Dec;14(4):viii'],

Induced in vitro cellular resistance to ara-C was shown to be secondary to altered deoxycytidine (dCyd) kinase activity, dCyd deaminase activity, or deoxynucleotides triphosphates (dNTP) pools. Recent studies reported no differences of ara-C metabolism in cells obtained from leukemic patients at diagnosis and at relapse after ara-C therapy, suggesting that unknown cellular biochemical determinants may be involved in acquisition of ara-C resistance. Using dialysed crude extracts of leukemic cells obtained from patients at diagnosis, we observed variable inhibition of their DNA polymerase activities by arabinosylcytosine monophosphate (ara-CMP) at 2 mmol/L (0% to 50% inhibition). In similar conditions, ara-CMP reduced the polymerase activities of human thymus extract by 35% and 55% in extract of HL-60 cells (cultured human promyelocytic cells). The ara-CMP factor responsible for inhibition of DNA polymerase activity was nondialysable, heat labile, proteinase K sensitive, and has an estimated molecular mass of 30 kilodalton by gel filtration. After partial purification, this protein had no DNA polymerase RNA polymerase activities.

As a rule it occurs after prolonged treatment (on average 41 months, cumulative dose 2.900 mg). The respiratory function pattern is that of an interstitial fibrosis characterised by reduced volumes and hypoxaemia and hypocapnic respiratory failure. The radiology reveals interstitial and predominantly basal shadows. The histology is often obtained, either by lung biopsy or frequently at necropsy, because the prognosis is poor with an 84% mortality from respiratory failure.

Heterozygotes (+/gt) developed mild asymptomatic spongiform brain lesions as did recipient inbred mice inoculated with gt/gt brain homogenates, some of whom also showed behavioral abnormalities [Sidman, R. L., Kinney, H. C. & Sweet, H. O. (1985) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 82, 253-257]. In these studies, inbred NFS/N mice inoculated intracerebrally at birth or as adults with gt/gt or first passage gt brain homogenates developed a progressive disease characterized by tremor, ataxia, and spasticity. The symptoms were milder and more slowly progressive than in the gt/gt homozygote, in the paralytic syndrome that followed neonatal inoculation of NFS/N mice with a wild murine leukemia virus (Cas-Br-M MuLV), or in the rapidly progressive ataxia and terminal bradykinesia that followed scrapie inoculation of NFS/N mice. The noninflammatory spongiform encephalopathy in affected NFS/N mice resembled that observed in gt/gt homozygotes, +/gt heterozygotes, and asymptomatic recipient inbred mice inoculated with gt/gt brain homogenates. Neither infectious MuLV nor MuLV proteins were detected in gt/gt brain homogenates or in affected recipient mouse brains. Scrapie-associated fibrils, readily identifiable in subcellular fractions of brains from scrapie-inoculated NFS/N mice, were not detected in similar brain fractions from NFS/N mice inoculated with gt brain homogenates. These results confirm and extend the suggestion that gt spongiform encephalopathy has both heritable and transmissible properties. Moreover, the transmissible agent of gt disease differs from both Cas-Br-M MuLV and scrapie in its disease-inducing properties in NFS/N mice. The capacity of NFS/N mice to express transmitted gt encephalopathy as clinical disease, to rapidly express Cas-Br-M MuLV spongiform encephalomyelopathy, and to develop mouse-adapted scrapie after a very short incubation time suggest a distinct sensitivity of NFS/N mice to transmissible spongiform encephalopathy.","['Hoffman, P M', 'Rohwer, R G', 'MacAuley, C', 'Bilello, J A', 'Hartley, J W', 'Morse, H C 3rd']","['Hoffman PM', 'Rohwer RG', 'MacAuley C', 'Bilello JA', 'Hartley JW', 'Morse HC 3rd']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,,IM,"['Animals', 'Brain/pathology', 'Encephalomyelitis/complications/*genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Neurologic Mutants', '*Mutation', 'Spinal Cord/pathology', 'Tremor/complications/*genetics/pathology']",1987/06/01 00:00,1987/06/01 00:01,['1987/06/01 00:00'],"['1987/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1987 Jun;84(11):3866-70. doi: 10.1073/pnas.84.11.3866.,,['10.1073/pnas.84.11.3866 [doi]'],,PMC304977,,,,

A previous report described the isolation of clonal EC cell lines that express the integrated neomycin-resistance gene (neo) linked to the Moloney murine leukemia virus LTR. The expression of the neo gene was explained by a cis-acting mechanism [Taketo, M., Gilboa, E. & Sherman, M. I. (1985) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 82, 2422-2426]. From one such EC cell line, we isolated the flanking cellular sequence 5' to the proviral genome, ligated it to various test constructs, and transfected into the parental EC cells. The cellular sequence increased expression of the LTR-linked neo gene significantly, in a manner independent of its orientation and position. The neo mRNA was initiated at the bona fide promoter of the LTR. By deletion analyses, we defined a region of DNA essential for the enhancer activity and determined its sequence. This region contains distinctly characteristic stretches as well as some similarity to various viral and cellular enhancers.

Primary clinical and radiological considerations in these patients were pulmonary edema and infection, and the diagnosis of pulmonary alveolar septal calcification was established only at autopsy. One patient, a 15-year-old girl, was found also to have parathyroid hyperplasia typical of familial hyperparathyroidism. The other, a 16-month-old girl, showed osteitis fibrosa of the bones and parathyroid hyperplasia of secondary type, suggesting that the pulmonary calcinosis resulted from hypercalcemia caused by a parathormone or prostaglandin-secreting tumor. The cause of pneumothorax and pneumomediastinum may have been rupture of calcified alveolar septa induced by high PEEP during ventilation of these patients.

The triangular test has the best properties: it allows an early termination of the trial whatever the difference between the treatment groups and without the risk of long duration trials. Sequential analyses can be performed at the same frequency as the usual interim analyses. These three sequential procedures have been applied to the analysis of two cooperative trials in haematology.

The crucial importance of these interactions in the regulation of early hematopoietic events has been convincingly demonstrated in vivo in the mutated steel mouse, and confirmed more recently in vitro in long-term cultures. Parts of the signal mediating these interactions are represented by locally secreted CSF-like growth factors or more recently characterized inhibitors of proliferation. more importantly however appears to be direct cell-cell communication, especially in the regulation of erythropoiesis and recent data suggest that specific adhesion processes might be required initially. As neoplastic clonal dominance is usually not maintained in vitro, experimental evidence for the involvement of the microenvironment in the regulation of leukemic hemopoiesis is still pending. However, it has been shown recently that in some conditions stromal cells may be manipulated in vitro and alter growth properties of leukemic cells. Understanding mechanisms regulating the interactions between hematopoietic and stromal cells may be of considerable importance since it should be possible to delineate and subsequently modulate in vitro the factors affecting stem cell properties.

Twenty percent of the group were mentally retarded and were receiving special educational assistance. The best clinical predictors of full-scale IQ were the number of radiation therapy courses, age, and the presence or absence of cerebral pathology as measured by computed tomography (CT). Children who were younger at the time of treatment, who received two courses of radiation therapy, and who had clinical seizures and structural abnormalities of the brain as detected by CT had the poorest psychological outcome.

These data demonstrate a significant association between TdT expression and Ig or T beta gene rearrangements even outside the lymphoid lineage, further supporting a role for TdT in Ig and T cell receptor gene assembly. These data also indicate that a coordinated program of lymphoid gene expression involving TdT-CD7-expression and Ig/T beta rearrangements can be activated before myeloid commitment.

The histopathological changes in the skin biopsy specimens from these cases were non-specific, and although the histology was considered to be atypical of pyoderma gangrenosum in one case, the unusual features could be attributed to the patient's neutropenia. (Skin biopsy was performed to exclude other specific pathology). Atypical bullous pyoderma gangrenosum is an uncommon association of the myeloid malignancies. It may remain unrecognised and should be considered more often.","['Hay, C R', 'Messenger, A G', 'Cotton, D W', 'Bleehen, S S', 'Winfield, D A']","['Hay CR', 'Messenger AG', 'Cotton DW', 'Bleehen SS', 'Winfield DA']",,['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,J Clin Pathol,Journal of clinical pathology,0376601,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Anemia, Refractory, with Excess of Blasts/*complications/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*complications/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pyoderma/*complications/pathology', 'Skin/pathology']",1987/04/01 00:00,1987/04/01 00:01,['1987/04/01 00:00'],"['1987/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Pathol. 1987 Apr;40(4):387-92. doi: 10.1136/jcp.40.4.387.,,['10.1136/jcp.40.4.387 [doi]'],,PMC1140969,,,,

A series of subclones were derived from early passages of this tumor. Three subsets of these leukemogenic subclones were identified. Two subsets demonstrated autostimulatory patterns of growth. This was due to the ectopic production of the T-cell lymphokine the panspecific hemopoietin IL-3 in one case and of the T-cell lymphokine granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in the other. The third type of subclone did not secrete any autostimulatory growth factor. In the subclone producing IL-3, one copy of IL-3 gene was rearranged and abnormal IL-3 RNA transcripts were present in the nucleus. Subclones producing GM-CSF also contained abnormal GM-CSF RNA transcripts, although no rearrangement of the GM-CSF gene was detected. All three sets of subclones shared a common rearrangement of one c-myb oncogene, suggesting that they share a common ancestor. These results suggest that initiation or progression of leukemogenic behavior in this abnormal clone occurred in three different ways, two of which involved autostimulation by the ectopic activation of T-cell lymphokine genes.","['Schrader, J W', 'Leslie, K B', 'Ziltener, H J', 'Schrader, S']","['Schrader JW', 'Leslie KB', 'Ziltener HJ', 'Schrader S']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic']",1987/05/01 00:00,1987/05/01 00:01,['1987/05/01 00:00'],"['1987/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 1987 May;34(1):39-46. doi: 10.1002/jcb.240340106.,['5R01 CA386484-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['10.1002/jcb.240340106 [doi]'],,,,,,

From a series of 635 cases of Ph+ CML, we selected 83 patients with information on blood counts over a period of 36 to 3 months before the diagnosis, and we estimated the time over which a haematologic diagnosis could or should have been anticipated. This time ranged between 24 and 3 months for all cases, and between 13 and 5.5 months for 50% of cases. These values correspond to between 31 and 13% of the median value (42 months) of survival duration that is usually calculated from the date of diagnosis.

This included 1 responding patient who had not previously responded to therapy with 6-mercaptopurine, thioguanine, or vinblastine. The 2 patients with complete remission did not show LD ARA-C-induced hypoplasia of bone marrow, although 1 had hypoplastic AML before therapy. Leukaemic cells from 1 patient showed in vivo maturation from M1 to M3 after LD ARA-C treatment. The present results, together with the published data, indicate that: a. LD ARA-C treatment, although it may have some toxic effects, is an effective treatment for some patients with AML, especially those with hypoplastic AML; b. Response to LD ARA-C can be obtained after one or several courses of treatment; c. LD ARA-C-induced remissions are sometimes obtained even in patients who fail in more conventional treatments; d. LD ARA-C-induced remissions can be achieved without bone marrow hypoplasia, and induction of hypoplasia by itself does not always result in complete remission; e. LD ARA-C can induce in vivo maturation of leukaemic cells. It is suggested that induction of remission in AML patients by LD ARA-C may result from either differentiation of leukaemic blast cells, cytotoxicity to leukaemic blasts, or both mechanisms acting together.","['Shtalrid, M', 'Lotem, J', 'Sachs, L', 'Berrebi, A']","['Shtalrid M', 'Lotem J', 'Sachs L', 'Berrebi A']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cytarabine/*administration & dosage/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",1987/01/01 00:00,1987/01/01 00:01,['1987/01/01 00:00'],"['1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 1987 Jan;38(1):3-11. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.1987.tb01416.x.,,['10.1111/j.1600-0609.1987.tb01416.x [doi]'],,,,,,

In the present studies, we used in vitro cultures of human cancer cells to reevaluate their potential as anticancer agents. Using continuous exposure, Illudins S and M were cytotoxic to human leukemia cells at concentrations of 6-100 nM, but dihydroilludin M was 3 orders of magnitude less toxic, thus identifying a ketone site as a structural feature critical for cytotoxicity. Cytokinetic studies showed that illudin S caused a complete block at the G1-S phase interface of the cell cycle. Kinetics of inhibition of radiolabeled thymidine, uridine, and leucine incorporation suggested a primary effect on DNA synthesis. In colony and liquid culture assays, cell killing was time dependent but near maximal with a 2-h exposure. Myeloid and T-lymphocyte leukemia cells were most sensitive (50% inhibitory concentration, 6-11 nM), but B-cell leukemia/lymphoma, melanoma, and ovarian carcinoma cells were at least 10 times more resistant.

CEM cells resistant to doxorubicin, epipodophyllotoxins, and 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine showed only a 2-fold increased resistance to illudin S. Illudins are novel and potent cytotoxins which may be preferentially active against human myeloid and T-cell leukemias, including cells resistant to more conventional chemotherapeutic agents.

Treatment with cytosine-arabinoside at high doses abolished this altered expression of c-myc and resulted in a twofold increase in the expression of a gene sequence encoding the invariant gamma-chain of class II histocompatibility antigens, preferentially expressed in resting B lymphocytes.

However, central nervous system (CNS) relapse still occurs in 6-10% of cases overall and in as many as 30% of cases with a poor prognosis in some series. These recurrences may be due in part to inadvertent underdosage of the cribriform plate, which is centrally situated between the orbits and is projected over their upper third in a lateral view. The dose to the adjacent meninges may thus be reduced by shielding of the radiosensitive lenses. This problem is exacerbated if conventional lateral fields centred on the mid-skull are used, because the eyes will not then project over one another. If the field centre is moved to the edge of the orbit, this problem of beam divergence can be overcome. Central axis beam blocking of both lenses is then possible, and in some patients the cribriform plate can be adequately irradiated. However, in most children the geometry of the orbit is such that it is necessary to add an anterior electron beam to ensure homogeneous dosage. These refinements in irradiation technique might prevent meningeal relapse with a lower whole-brain dose and, hence, fewer neuropsychological sequelae. This hypothesis could be tested in a clinical trial.","['Williams, M V']",['Williams MV'],,['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Radiol,The British journal of radiology,0373125,,IM,"['Child', 'Ethmoid Bone/*diagnostic imaging', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*radiotherapy', 'Meningeal Neoplasms/*radiotherapy', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*prevention & control', 'Radiotherapy/methods', 'Radiotherapy Dosage', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed']",1987/05/01 00:00,1987/05/01 00:01,['1987/05/01 00:00'],"['1987/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Radiol. 1987 May;60(713):469-75. doi: 10.1259/0007-1285-60-713-469.,,['10.1259/0007-1285-60-713-469 [doi]'],,,,,,

Two-dimensional gel analysis showed the mutant ATIII to have an identical molecular size distribution to the normal form.

In vitro measurements of total nuclear RNA synthesis in nuclei isolated from Friend cells at different stages of differentiation show the total RNA synthesis increases 1.5-fold at day 1 of induction and then decreases through days 2 and 3 to approximately 75% of its rate of synthesis in the nuclei of uninduced cells. The synthesis of RNA polymerase III transcripts undergoes a similar fluctuation through day 2 of induction, but increases again at day 3. The specific synthesis of tRNA(iMet) was measured by hybridization of labelled nuclear RNA to a tRNA(iMet) gene probe. During erythroid differentiation the percentage of nuclear RNA represented by tRNA(iMet) remains constant (0.065%), so that the absolute synthesis of tRNA(iMet) fluctuates during differentiation, in the fluctuations in the synthesis of total nuclear RNA. The relative synthesis of tRNA(iMet) in vivo was studied by labelling cells with 32Pi, isolating the resulting radioactive tRNA--5S RNA population, and hybridizing this population to a tRNA(iMet) gene probe. The ratio of tRNA(iMet)/total tRNA--5S RNA in newly synthesized cytoplasmic RNA remains similar throughout differentiation (averaging 0.0171), implying that the fluctuations observed in the nuclear synthesis of tRNA(iMet) during differentiation probably also occur for the nuclear synthesis of most tRNA and 5S RNA species. Attempts were made to measure the relative steady-state concentration of tRNA(iMet) using both aminoacylation and in vitro end labelling of tRNA followed by hybridization to a tRNA(iMet) gene probe. These two methods gave different results and we discuss the possible pitfalls of using enzymatic methods for quantitating tRNA concentrations in the cell.","['Schmedt, E', 'Kleiman, L']","['Schmedt E', 'Kleiman L']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],Canada,Biochem Cell Biol,Biochemistry and cell biology = Biochimie et biologie cellulaire,8606068,"['0 (RNA, Transfer, Amino Acyl)', '0 (tRNA(m)(Met), methionine-)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'RNA, Transfer, Amino Acyl/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic']",1987/03/01 00:00,1987/03/01 00:01,['1987/03/01 00:00'],"['1987/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem Cell Biol. 1987 Mar;65(3):188-94. doi: 10.1139/o87-024.,,['10.1139/o87-024 [doi]'],,,,,,

We studied 81 cases of ALL using immunoperoxidase stain for nuclear terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) and immunoalkaline phosphatase stain for surface markers (using monoclonal antibody J5 for common ALL antigen [CALLA], Leu-1 for pan-T antigen, and B1 for pan-B antigen) on air-dried smears. The cases were classified as common ALL (TdT+, CALLA+, pan-T-, and pan-B-) (41 cases), null-ALL (TdT+, CALLA-, pan-T-, and pan-B-) (19 cases), T-ALL (TdT+, CALLA-, pan-T+, and pan-B-) (nine cases), B-ALL (TdT-, CALLA-, pan-T-, and pan-B+) (six cases), pre-B-ALL (TdT+/-, CALLA+, pan-T-, and pan-B+) (four cases), or pre-T-ALL (TdT+, CALLA+, pan-T+, and pan-B-) (two cases).

MDR in human KB carcinoma cells selected for resistance to colchicine, vinblastine, or doxorubicin (former generic name adriamycin) is associated with overexpression of the ""MDR1"" gene, which encodes P-glycoprotein. We previously have isolated an overlapping set of cDNA clones for the human MDR1 gene from multidrug-resistant KB cells. Here we report the construction of a full-length cDNA for the human MDR1 gene and show that this reconstructed cDNA, when inserted into a retroviral expression vector containing the long terminal repeats of Moloney leukemia virus or Harvey sarcoma virus, functions in mouse NIH 3T3 and human KB cells to confer the complete multidrug-resistance phenotype. These results suggest that the human MDR1 gene may be used as a positive selectable marker to introduce genes into human cells and to transform human cells to multidrug resistance without introducing nonhuman antigens.","['Ueda, K', 'Cardarelli, C', 'Gottesman, M M', 'Pastan, I']","['Ueda K', 'Cardarelli C', 'Gottesman MM', 'Pastan I']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'SML2Y3J35T (Colchicine)']",IM,"['Colchicine/*pharmacology', 'DNA/*metabolism', 'Doxorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance', '*Genes', 'Humans', 'KB Cells', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Plasmids', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Vinblastine/*pharmacology']",1987/05/01 00:00,1987/05/01 00:01,['1987/05/01 00:00'],"['1987/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1987 May;84(9):3004-8. doi: 10.1073/pnas.84.9.3004.,,['10.1073/pnas.84.9.3004 [doi]'],,PMC304789,,,,

From a human promyelocytic leukemia cell line, we have isolated a gamma-actin cDNA clone with amino acid substitutions in a region highly conserved in the many actins analyzed. To our knowledge, this is the first example of a variant gamma-actin in a human neoplasm. A separate finding from the analysis of this clone is that the gamma-actin 3'-untranslated region is among the most highly conserved of all 3'-untranslated sequences so far reported, but is entirely different from the beta-actin 3'-untranslated region. The high degree of evolutionary conservation suggests that the 3'-untranslated regions of these two mRNAs have important and distinct functional roles that were already fully differentiated more than 100 million years ago. Mutations affecting four major cytoskeletal components have now been identified in human neoplastic cells. These findings suggest that mutated cytoskeletal genes may be members of a class of oncogenes, fundamentally different from both the nuclear-acting (e.g., myc and simian virus 40 large tumor antigen) and growth factor/receptor/protein kinase-related (e.g., sis, erbB, and ras) types of oncogenes.","['Chou, C C', 'Davis, R C', 'Fuller, M L', 'Slovin, J P', 'Wong, A', 'Wright, J', 'Kania, S', 'Shaked, R', 'Gatti, R A', 'Salser, W A']","['Chou CC', 'Davis RC', 'Fuller ML', 'Slovin JP', 'Wong A', 'Wright J', 'Kania S', 'Shaked R', 'Gatti RA', 'Salser WA']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Actins/*genetics', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA/isolation & purification', '*Genes', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'RNA, Messenger/*genetics']",1987/05/01 00:00,1987/05/01 00:01,['1987/05/01 00:00'],"['1987/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1987 May;84(9):2575-9. doi: 10.1073/pnas.84.9.2575.,"['CA32186/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA40969/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM18586/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",['10.1073/pnas.84.9.2575 [doi]'],,PMC304700,,['GENBANK/M16247'],,

No antibody reactivity was detected to a range of other cell lines or to a limited number of normal human tissues. Peripheral blood lymphocytes, monocytes, basophils, eosinophils, erythrocytes and platelets did not react with the antibody. Bone marrow smears exhibited binding of NC-1 to myeloid cells at the promyelocyte and later stages of differentiation along the granulocyte lineage. The KG-1 myeloblastoid and U937 myelomonocytic lines could be induced to express the antigen, when exposed to neuraminidase which removes terminal sialic acid from carbohydrate residues. Similarly myeloblasts in bone marrow samples bound NC-1 when they were treated with neuraminidase. HL-60 cells induced to differentiate to granulocytes by treatment with retinoic acid continued to express the antigen. A similar result was observed when HL-60 cells were induced to differentiate to monocytes, even though blood monocytes failed to bind the antibody.

Studies in a rat model for acute myelocytic leukemia (BNML).,453-9,"During the invasion of leukemic cells of the rat acute myelocytic leukemia model BNML in the bone marrow, the number of normal bone marrow stem cells (CFU-S) decreased while simultaneously an increase of CFU-S in the leukemic spleen was observed. A small reduction in the tumor load by low dose cyclophosphamide treatment (10 mg/kg) caused a temporary CFU-S recovery in the bone marrow. After a therapeutic dose of cyclophosphamide (100 mg/kg), the CFU-S numbers in femur and spleen decreased to low levels but they rapidly increased immediately thereafter. In the spleen, however, the CFU-S increase halted when femoral CFU-S numbers reached normal levels. Splenectomy following cyclophosphamide treatment revealed that the splenic CFU-S population does not play a role in regeneration of hemopoiesis. During the subsequent leukemia relapse, CFU-S in the femur decreased again while spleen CFU-S tended to rise. It is concluded that the bone marrow CFU-S, which survive both the leukemia and the remission-induction treatment, and not the migrated, extramedullary localized stem cells are the major source for the restoration of normal hemopoiesis.","['Martens, A C', 'Hagenbeek, A']","['Martens AC', 'Hagenbeek A']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,['8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Division', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Cyclophosphamide/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Hematopoiesis/drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Rats']",1987/01/01 00:00,1987/01/01 00:01,['1987/01/01 00:00'],"['1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1987;11(5):453-9. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(87)90077-4.,,['10.1016/0145-2126(87)90077-4 [doi]'],,,,,,

We found that fagaronine, after 3 days, reduces in a concentration dependent relationship the cell growth rate without lethality and this effect on the cell growth is irreversible. Reducing the cell growth rate by 50% (IC50 = 3 X 10(-6)M) is sufficient to induce an optimal amount of hemoglobin synthesis (75% benzidine-positive cells, 13-15 pg hemoglobin/cell) after 4 days of culture. Considering the variation of the total intracellular protein content during the response, it appears that fagaronine stimulated mainly hemoglobin synthesis, and to a lesser extent non-hemoglobin proteins. These results suggest that the novel antileukemic alkaloid, fagaronine, can be considered as a potent inducer of differentiated-associated properties in the human K 562 leukemic cells.","['Comoe, L', 'Jeannesson, P', 'Trentesaux, C', 'Desoize, B', 'Jardillier, J C']","['Comoe L', 'Jeannesson P', 'Trentesaux C', 'Desoize B', 'Jardillier JC']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzophenanthridines)', '0 (Hemoglobins)', '0 (Phenanthridines)', '41758-44-5 (fagaronine)']",IM,"['Alkaloids/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Benzophenanthridines', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Hemoglobins/biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*drug therapy', '*Phenanthridines']",1987/01/01 00:00,1987/01/01 00:01,['1987/01/01 00:00'],"['1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1987;11(5):445-51. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(87)90076-2.,,['10.1016/0145-2126(87)90076-2 [doi]'],,,,,,

Bone marrow cells were cultured from 42 patients at diagnosis, 26 patients in relapse, 36 patients in early remission and 31 patients in full remission. The results of culture growth were characterized by sparse or no growth at diagnosis. No inhibition of normal CFU-C by leukemic cells was demonstrated by co-culture experiments. In relapsed marrows with blasts exceeding 60%, the culture results were identical to those at first presentation. The colonies grown in ALL cultures showed normal morphology with a normal granulocytic and monocytic differentiation. The colony-forming potential gradually increased following induction therapy, but there was no relationship between the CFU-C number and the percentage of blasts. The impaired granulopoiesis usually recovered once a remission was obtained and remained normal throughout the remission period. In some instances, cultures were performed within a short period prior to relapse or carried out more than one occasion during stable remission, wide fluctuations in CFU-C incidences were observed.

We therefore determined the absolute bioavailability of orally and intramuscularly administered methotrexate in 12 pediatric patients receiving 13 to 120 mg/m2 methotrexate every week as maintenance therapy for ALL. Mean bioavailability, as determined by comparing the area under the concentration-time curve after oral or intramuscular administration with that produced by the same dosage given intravenously, was 33% (range 13% to 76%) for oral (n = 11) and 76% (54% to 112%) for intramuscular (n = 7) administration (P less than 0.01). Median bioavailability (with orally administered dosages less than or equal to 40 mg/m2 (range 13 to 40 mg/m2) was 42% (19% to 76%); at dosages greater than 40 mg/m2 (43 to 76 mg/m2), bioavailability was significantly lower, 17.5% (12.7% to 22.3%, p less than 0.02).

All patients had karyotypic abnormalities: three had translocation of chromosomes 8 and 21, and one had an unspecified hypodiploid clone. The three patients who developed intracranial tumors responded well to triple agent (cytosine arabinoside, hydrocortisone, and methotrexate) intrathecal chemotherapy and systemic chemotherapy, with or without local irradiation, as evidenced by rapid disappearance of the tumors. Two children are disease-free after 17 and 57 months. One patient with paraspinal tumor failed to achieve a systemic remission but had no evidence of granulocytic sarcoma at autopsy.

The lesions were focal (3), multifocal (9) or diffuse (2). They occurred more frequently in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia who had received intravenous methotrexate therapy. Ten of these 12 children had also received whole brain irradiation. The pathogenesis of the cerebellar sclerosis is unknown, but it is possible that extrinsic cerebellar compression by tumor or chronically increased intracranial pressure may have played a role in 6, ischemia/hypoxia in 3, and methotrexate toxicity in 2. No clear associations could be ascertained in 3. Methotrexate may be a previously unrecognized cause of cerebellar cortical injury.

In this cell-free membrane system, fMLP in the presence of GTP plus Ca2+, GTP in the presence of Ca2+, or Ca2+ alone could induce the formation of inositol bis- and trisphosphate (IP2 and IP3, respectively). When the intact cells were pre-treated with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, the fMLP- and GTP-induced formation of IP2 and IP3 was markedly reduced but the Ca2+-induced reactions were not reduced in the isolated membranes. This result suggests that protein kinase C impairs the coupling of the GTP-binding protein to the phospholipase C. In another experiment, preincubation of the isolated membranes with pure rat brain protein kinase C inhibited the fMLP-induced formation of IP2, but did not inhibit the GTP- or Ca2+-induced reaction. Under the same conditions, protein kinase C did not inhibit the fMLP-, GTP-, or Ca2+-induced formation of IP3. This result suggests that protein kinase C impairs additionally the coupling of the fMLP receptor to the GTP-binding protein leading to the formation of IP2. The reason for the failure of protein kinase C to inhibit the fMLP-induced formation of IP3 in the cell-free membrane system is unknown, but several possible mechanisms are discussed.","['Kikuchi, A', 'Ikeda, K', 'Kozawa, O', 'Takai, Y']","['Kikuchi A', 'Ikeda K', 'Kozawa O', 'Takai Y']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Diphosphoglyceric Acids)', '0 (Inositol Phosphates)', '0 (Membrane Lipids)', '0 (Sugar Phosphates)', '138-81-8 (2,3-Diphosphoglycerate)', '59880-97-6 (N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine)', '86-01-1 (Guanosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['2,3-Diphosphoglycerate', 'Calcium/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/drug effects/metabolism', 'Diphosphoglyceric Acids/pharmacology', 'Guanosine Triphosphate/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Inositol Phosphates/*biosynthesis', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Membrane Lipids/biosynthesis', 'N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine/*pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase C/*metabolism', 'Sugar Phosphates/*biosynthesis', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology']",1987/05/15 00:00,1987/05/15 00:01,['1987/05/15 00:00'],"['1987/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1987/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1987 May 15;262(14):6766-70.,,['S0021-9258(18)48310-X [pii]'],,,,,,

Binding of [3H]PDBu increased within 12 h of 1,25-(OH)2D3 treatment, and a 60-130% increase in [3H]PDBu receptor levels was observed within 24 h. By 48 h, however, [3H]PDBu binding was not different from control. Scatchard analysis of [3H]PDBu binding showed no statistical differences in Kd value (Kd approximately equal to 30 nM) between 1,25-(OH)2D3-treated and control cells 22 h post-treatment; however, a 2-fold increase in Bmax was observed in treated (338 +/- 24 pmol/10(9) cells) compared to control cultures (170 +/- 14 pmol/10(9) cells). Stimulation of [3H]PDBu binding was dependent on 1,25-(OH)2D3 concentrations over a range of 1-100 nM. Homogenates from 1,25-(OH)2D3-treated HL-60 cells also demonstrated an increase (70%) in [3H]PDBu binding to the Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent enzyme protein kinase C as assessed by incubation of cell homogenates with [3H]PDBu in the presence of saturating phosphatidylserine and calcium concentrations. This suggests that the increase in [3H]PDBu binding cannot be entirely explained by modulation of the latter two agents. Cycloheximide (5 microM), an inhibitor of protein synthesis, ablated the 1,25-(OH)2D3-stimulated increase in [3H]PDBu binding to intact HL-60 cells. These data demonstrate that an increase in [3H]PDBu binding occurs early in the course of 1,25-(OH)2D3-induced differentiation, results from an increased number of [3H]PDBu-binding site, and is dependent on protein synthesis.","['Martell, R E', 'Simpson, R U', 'Taylor, J M']","['Martell RE', 'Simpson RU', 'Taylor JM']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Caenorhabditis elegans Proteins)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Phorbol Esters)', '0 (Receptors, Drug)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (phorbol ester binding protein)', '0 (phorbol ester receptor)', '37558-16-0 (Phorbol 12,13-Dibutyrate)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']",IM,"['*Caenorhabditis elegans Proteins', 'Calcitriol/*pharmacology', 'Carrier Proteins', 'Cell Line', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Phorbol 12,13-Dibutyrate', 'Phorbol Esters/*metabolism', '*Protein Kinase C', '*Receptors, Drug', 'Receptors, Immunologic/drug effects/*metabolism']",1987/04/25 00:00,1987/04/25 00:01,['1987/04/25 00:00'],"['1987/04/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/04/25 00:01 [medline]', '1987/04/25 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1987 Apr 25;262(12):5570-5.,['CA36507/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['S0021-9258(18)45610-4 [pii]'],,,,,,

We now report that a combination of recombinant interferon alpha (Intron; Schering) and retinoic acid is synergistically cytostatic for HL-60 cells. Retinoic acid (RA) induced the differentiation of HL-60 cells into granulocytes. Interferon (IFN) alone at 1-1000 IU/ml had no effect on either differentiation or proliferation of HL-60 cells. The addition of 1000 IU/ml of IFN and 10(-7) M RA at the initiation of culture reduced the number of viable cells to 28% of that observed for cells treated with RA alone. The decreased number of cells was a result of decreased cellular proliferation, rather than of a cytotoxic effect of the combination. IFN-RA-treated cells differentiated more rapidly than cells treated with RA alone. In addition, the final percentage of mature cells was increased at day 7 in IFN-RA-treated cultures, as compared with RA-treated cells. Simultaneous treatment of the cells with IFN and RA decreased the concentration of RA needed to induce differentiation or to exert a cytostatic effect. Significant changes in the nuclear structure of RA-treated HL-60 cells after 24 h have been reported. Cells were pulsed with RA for 24 h, washed, and IFN added. At day 7, cell growth was inhibited to the same extent as that of cells continuously exposed to IFN-RA. However, while 70% of the continuously exposed cell differentiated, cells pulsed with RA and subsequently treated with IFN did not differentiate. The results of this investigation further support our findings that combinations of IFN and inducers of differentiation may be of importance in the treatment of leukemia.","['Kohlhepp, E A', 'Condon, M E', 'Hamburger, A W']","['Kohlhepp EA', 'Condon ME', 'Hamburger AW']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Drug Synergism', 'Granulocytes/*cytology', 'Hematopoiesis/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interferon Type I/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/pathology', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Time Factors', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology']",1987/05/01 00:00,1987/05/01 00:01,['1987/05/01 00:00'],"['1987/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1987 May;15(4):414-8.,,,,,,,,

The pharmacokinetics of ara-C in plasma and its 5'-triphosphate (ara-CTP) in leukemic cells from peripheral blood were studied after a single infusion of 3 g/m2 over 2 h in 13 patients. Accumulation of ara-CTP in leukemic cells remained linear until 1 to 2 h after the infusion. At the time when the rate of ara-CTP accumulation deviated from linearity, the plasma concentration of ara-C was 5- to 20-fold lower [8.1 +/- 4.4 (SD) microM] than the steady-state level during the infusion. Plasma ara-C and cellular ara-CTP pharmacokinetics were studied after two serial infusions in 14 additional patients. Varying the duration of infusion of an ara-C dose between 1, 2, and 4 h (corresponding to infusion rates of 3000, 1500, and 750 mg/m2/h) did not substantially change the rate of ara-CTP accumulation by leukemic cells. The peak ara-CTP concentration and the area under the concentration times time curve (AUC) of ara-CTP in leukemic cells increased with prolongation of the infusion. Although steady-state concentration of ara-C and AUC of ara-C in plasma were proportionally reduced by 1.0 or 0.5 g/m2 infusion over 2 h, ara-CTP accumulation rate and AUC in leukemic cells did not change compared with administration of 3 g/m2 over 2 h. However, when the infusion rate was further reduced to 0.4 or 0.3 g/m2 over 2 h, resulting in steady-state plasma ara-C concentrations of less than 7 microM, the accumulation rate of ara-CTP was substantially reduced as was the ara-CTP intracellular AUC. The cellular elimination rate of ara-CTP remained constant under all infusion conditions. These findings support the conclusion that high-dose ara-C therapy, as currently administered, results in plasma ara-C concentrations that saturate the accumulation of ara-CTP by circulating leukemic cells. We recommend that intermediate dose rates, 200 to 250 mg/m2/h, be evaluated in future studies as an alternative to the substantially higher ara-C dose rates currently in use.","['Plunkett, W', 'Liliemark, J O', 'Adams, T M', 'Nowak, B', 'Estey, E', 'Kantarjian, H', 'Keating, M J']","['Plunkett W', 'Liliemark JO', 'Adams TM', 'Nowak B', 'Estey E', 'Kantarjian H', 'Keating MJ']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Arabinonucleotides)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '13191-15-6 (Arabinofuranosylcytosine Triphosphate)']",IM,"['Arabinofuranosylcytosine Triphosphate/*metabolism', 'Arabinonucleotides/*metabolism', 'Blast Crisis', 'Cytarabine/*administration & dosage/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism', 'Metabolic Clearance Rate']",1987/06/01 00:00,1987/06/01 00:01,['1987/06/01 00:00'],"['1987/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1987 Jun 1;47(11):3005-11.,"['CA 28153/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 32839/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,

Twenty-seven had leukemia and 15 had various solid tumors. The drug was administered in escalating doses of 10 to 40 mg/m2/course in 3 equal fractions over 3 consecutive days at 14- to 21-day intervals. Myelosuppression and mucositis were the limiting toxicities for short-term administration. Nausea, vomiting, and elevation of liver enzymes and bilirubin were the other toxicities encountered. Peak toxicity occurred 2 weeks after drug administration with median recovery by day 24. All but 4 patients with solid tumors had prior anthracyclines. Mild cardiac function changes without clinical symptoms were observed in 17 of 35 patients measured by serial cardiac evaluations. In addition, there were 4 patients with congestive heart failure. On postmortem examination, 4 patients had changes consistent with anthracycline cardiomyopathy at a prior median total anthracycline dose of 175 mg/m2. The maximum tolerated dose for patients with solid tumors was 15 mg/m2 course in 3 divided doses. Patients with leukemia tolerated 30 mg/m2/course. Six of 15 evaluable patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia who received greater than or equal to 30 mg/m2 idarubicin achieved a remission (M1 marrow status). The plasma clearance of idarubicin fits a 3-compartment model with a harmonic mean half-life of 2.4 min, 0.6 h, and 11.3 h for alpha, beta, and gamma phases, respectively. Idarubicinol was the only metabolite detected in the plasma and it accumulated during the 3 days of therapy. Idarubicin is similar to daunorubicin in pharmacology and toxicity. While the cardiotoxic dose still must be delineated, the complete remission achieved in multiple relapsed patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia indicate promising activity in at least that disease.","['Tan, C T', 'Hancock, C', 'Steinherz, P', 'Bacha, D M', 'Steinherz, L', 'Luks, E', 'Winick, N', 'Meyers, P', 'Mondora, A', 'Dantis, E']","['Tan CT', 'Hancock C', 'Steinherz P', 'Bacha DM', 'Steinherz L', 'Luks E', 'Winick N', 'Meyers P', 'Mondora A', 'Dantis E', 'et al.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', '*Antineoplastic Agents', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Daunorubicin/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/therapeutic use', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/blood/*drug therapy', 'Metabolic Clearance Rate', 'Neoplasms/blood/*drug therapy']",1987/06/01 00:00,1987/06/01 00:01,['1987/06/01 00:00'],"['1987/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1987 Jun 1;47(11):2990-5.,['CA29564/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,

In the coculture, a large number of HL-60 cells remained in the supernatant but some of them became firmly attached to KM-102 cells. The attached HL-60 cells showed little positive reaction in the NBT test when the culture was supplemented with 10(-9) to 10(-7) M 1 alpha, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. In contrast, differentiation in the supernatant HL-60 cells was strikingly responsive to the agent in a dose-dependent way. Furthermore, the complete inhibition was observed in the incorporation of [3H]thymidine into the attached HL-60 cells with autoradiography, but 23.6% of the supernatant cells moderately incorporated [3H] thymidine into their nuclei. There was no attachment between HL-60 cells and stromal cells from human thymus and lymph node, or between lymphocytic leukemia cells and marrow stromal cells. These results indicate that there is direct cellular interaction between myeloid leukemic cells and marrow stromal cells which modulates the proliferation and differentiation of the myeloid leukemic cells. This modulation by marrow stromal cells is more strongly affected by this interaction than by exogenously added differentiation-inducing agents. Apparently marrow stromal cells produce a definitive milieu for the proliferation and differentiation of myeloid leukemic cells.","['Ohkawa, H', 'Harigaya, K']","['Ohkawa H', 'Harigaya K']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['298-83-9 (Nitroblue Tetrazolium)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']",IM,"['*Bone Marrow Cells', 'Calcitriol/pharmacology', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/pathology', 'Nitroblue Tetrazolium']",1987/06/01 00:00,1987/06/01 00:01,['1987/06/01 00:00'],"['1987/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1987 Jun 1;47(11):2879-82.,,,,,,,,

To explore the possible use of these compounds for purging remission bone marrow cells of leukemic cells, we examined the cytotoxic effect of these compounds on normal hematopoietic progenitor cells and leukemic cell line cells (HL-60, K-562, KG-1a, KG-1, and Daudi) by using the clonogenic assay. When cells were treated with CP-46,665-1 or ET-18-OCH3 (50 micrograms/ml for 1 h), these compounds did not inhibit the growth of normal progenitors, whereas the growth of the clonogenic leukemic cells was inhibited with differences in their sensitivities to the cytotoxic effect of CP-46,665-1 and ET-18-OCH3. Incubation of leukemic cells (HL-60 and Daudi cells) with both CP-46,665-1 (50 micrograms/ml) and ET-18-OCH3 (50 micrograms/ml) for 1 h resulted in a greater reduction of clonogenic leukemic cells than treated with each compound alone. Approximately a 3 log killing of clonogenic HL-60 cells and a 5 log killing of Daudi cells was achieved; however, the combined treatment of normal bone marrow cells with CP-46,665-1 and ET-18-OCH3 did not alter the growth of normal progenitors. This combined treatment also selectively eliminated the leukemic cells (HL-60 and Daudi cells) from a mixture (1000:1) of normal bone marrow cells and leukemic cells.

These compounds could potentially be useful in purging bone marrow of leukemic cells in autologous marrow transplantation in acute leukemia. To determine the efficacy of pharmacological purging by ALP, we have designed a human assay system to mimic the conditions expected in the clinical setting of autotransplantation using remission marrow. A simulated remission marrow (SRM) was prepared by mixing normal marrow cells and HL60 cells in a ratio of 1,000:1. The effect of cryopreservation on ALP-treated normal, HL60, and SRM cells was examined. In separate experiments, ALP significantly reduced the number of clonogenic HL60 cells with no effect on normal marrow progenitors. The effect of ALP was more apparent after cryopreservation. Incubation of HL60 cells with 50 micrograms/mL ALP for four hours followed by cryopreservation resulted approximately in a 3 log reduction of clonogenic HL60 cells. ALP also selectively purged the small number of leukemic cells from SRM. In SRM, the data suggested that ALP had indirect cytotoxic activity on leukemic cells by enhancing the cytotoxic activity of monocytes in addition to its direct effect. We found no evidence that clonogenic HL60 cells decreased because of induction of differentiation by ALP. These data indicated that treatment of marrow cells with ALP offers an efficient means to eliminate leukemic cells from the graft.","['Okamoto, S', 'Olson, A C', 'Vogler, W R', 'Winton, E F']","['Okamoto S', 'Olson AC', 'Vogler WR', 'Winton EF']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Lysophospholipids)', '0 (Phospholipids)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow/drug effects', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Freezing', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Lysophospholipids', 'Phospholipids/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Time Factors']",1987/05/01 00:00,1987/05/01 00:01,['1987/05/01 00:00'],"['1987/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1987 May;69(5):1381-7.,['CA-29850/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['S0006-4971(20)78584-8 [pii]'],,,,,,

Forty-one (80%) patients achieved a hematologic response, 36 (71%) of them attaining a complete hematologic remission with normal peripheral WBC and differential counts. Responding patients showed continuous but slow normalization of several other blood and marrow parameters including platelet counts, serum lactic dehydrogenase and B12 levels, and marrow cellularity and maturation index.

These changes were persistent for 6 months or longer in 18 patients, seven of whom had continuous suppression of the Philadelphia chromosome to less than 90% for a median of 30+ months (range 21+ to 39+ months).

The univariate analysis identified three parameters associated with poor prognosis: high monocyte counts, low platelet counts and splenomegaly. When all the initial features were included in a multiple regression model, only high monocyte counts and spleen enlargement retained their unfavourable prognostic influence (P = 0.002 and P = 0.02, respectively).

On the other hand, we found that such efflux consists of a saturable as well as an unsaturable process using our newly-designed kinetic approach. In addition, greater Vmax and lower Km were found in the saturable process of efflux in resistant cells as compared with those in sensitive cells. In conclusion, these results suggest that broad cross-resistance among structurally unrelated drugs, i.e., multidrug resistance, is associated with an efflux-oriented transport carrier with broad affinity for these lipophilic drugs with a polycyclic structure.","['Inaba, M']",['Inaba M'],,['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Gan To Kagaku Ryoho,Gan to kagaku ryoho.

The alkyl-lysophospholipids produced nonspecific effects of almost equal intensity in both sensitive and resistant tumor cells. These effects were compared with those of verapamil, a calcium channel blocker. Verapamil, as reported previously, specifically inhibited the efflux of drugs from tumor cells, especially drug-resistant tumor cells, thereby enhancing the accumulation of antitumor agents in the cells. Thus the actions of alkyl-lysophospholipids and verapamil in tumor cells were obviously different.

This approach may offer a novel strategy for the demonstration and selection of populations of normal hemopoietic progenitors in other patients where the malignant cells cannot be distinguished by chromosome analysis.","['Hogge, D E', 'Coulombel, L', 'Kalousek, D K', 'Eaves, C J', 'Eaves, A C']","['Hogge DE', 'Coulombel L', 'Kalousek DK', 'Eaves CJ', 'Eaves AC']",,['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (Isoenzymes)', 'EC 1.1.1.49 (Glucosephosphate Dehydrogenase)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow/enzymology', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Child', '*Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Female', 'Glucosephosphate Dehydrogenase/*analysis/genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*enzymology', 'Heterozygote', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/analysis/genetics', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*enzymology', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Time Factors']",1987/04/01 00:00,1987/04/01 00:01,['1987/04/01 00:00'],"['1987/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Hematol. 1987 Apr;24(4):389-94. doi: 10.1002/ajh.2830240408.,,['10.1002/ajh.2830240408 [doi]'],,,,,,

Method, indications and results of over 1,000 completed biopsies with special reference to chronic myeloproliferative diseases].",1-24,"One thousand and five bone marrow biopsies were performed in patients with haematologic or oncologic disorders during a ten year period from 1976 to 1985 according to the method of Jamshidi and Swaim. Indications and method of biopsy are discussed in detail. Major side effects were not observed, however minor accidents (0.2%) as well as problems in yielding biopsy-material (1.6%) are reported. The rate of biopsy-failure, including biopsies with insufficient (crushed) material, was 5%. In our hands the predominant value of the Jamshidi-biopsy for diagnosis of hematologic disorders is given by the following reasons: Bone marrow histology gives a more detailed architectural picture than cytologic smears. Sampling of bone marrow for both methods (cytology and histology) through the same instrument is possible. The procedure is easily performed and gives the patient no more discomfort than a simple sternal puncture. Chronic myeloproliferative disorders (CMPD, 31%), malignant lymphomas (40%) and aplastic (hypoplastic) syndromes (4%) were the most frequent indications for bone marrow biopsy. Clinical and histological findings were compared in 235 patients with CMPD. The histological defined entity of chronic megacaryocytic-granulocytic myelosis could be differentiated easily from chronic granulocytic leukemia (CGL), however it was not always distinguishable from primary thrombocythemia by means of clinical and hematological criteria. Myelofibroses on the basis of CGL were separated from idiopathic or postpolycythemic fibroses by hematological findings. The diagnostic value of bone marrow biopsies was superior to cytology in all CMPD and proved to be an essential diagnostic method in cases with high platelet count. Marrow involvement was found in 59% of 218 previously untreated patients with non Hodgkin's lymphomas and in 9% of 123 patients with Hodgkin's disease. Jamshidi-biopsy proved to be a simple and indispensable procedure in staging of Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas.","['Seewann, H L']",['Seewann HL'],,['ger'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Austria,Wien Med Wochenschr Suppl,Wiener medizinische Wochenschrift.

Retinoyl beta-D-glucuronide (1 microM) inhibited HL-60 cell proliferation by 55-75%, inhibited tritiated thymidine incorporation into DNA by 63-80%, and induced 38-50% of the cells to differentiate into mature granulocytes. The potency of growth inhibition and induction of differentiation by retinoyl beta-D-glucuronide was similar to that of all-trans-retinoic acid. The continuous presence of either retinoyl beta-D-glucuronide or all-trans-retinoic acid was not required to obtain maximum growth arrest and differentiation: a 1-hr exposure of HL-60 cells to the retinoids gave the same response (measured after a total incubation time of 48 hr) as a 24-hr or 48-hr continuous treatment. Retinoyl beta-D-glucuronide (0.1-0.2 mM) was 50% less cytotoxic to HL-60 cells than all-trans-retinoic acid at an equimolar concentration. Retinoyl beta-D-glucuronide was not significantly metabolized to other retinoids; retinoic acid was not formed during incubation. We conclude that retinoyl beta-D-glucuronide can arrest HL-60 cell proliferation and induce their differentiation into mature granulocytes; it may act by itself or by being hydrolyzed to retinoic acid, which could be immediately utilized and metabolized. The therapeutic use of this retinoid as an antineoplastic agent is suggested.","['Zile, M H', 'Cullum, M E', 'Simpson, R U', 'Barua, A B', 'Swartz, D A']","['Zile MH', 'Cullum ME', 'Simpson RU', 'Barua AB', 'Swartz DA']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['401-10-5 (retinoyl glucuronide)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Replication/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Tretinoin/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/pharmacology']",1987/04/01 00:00,1987/04/01 00:01,['1987/04/01 00:00'],"['1987/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1987 Apr;84(8):2208-12. doi: 10.1073/pnas.84.8.2208.,['CA 36507/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['10.1073/pnas.84.8.2208 [doi]'],,PMC304618,,,,

It was not detected on the surface of either parental HL60 cells or variants with aberrant primary granules (HL60-A7). In these promyelocytes it was found to be intracytoplasmic, in a granular pattern. In the work presented here, this antigen and other granule-related glycoproteins were studied by radiolabeling, subcellular fractionation and gel electrophoresis. The major findings include the following: the anti-D46 antibody precipitated one major and one minor glycosylated component, each of which migrated with a different electrophoretic mobility, depending on whether it was derived from cells with or without granules. Incorporation of radioactive amino acids, but not monosaccharides, revealed an additional component of lower mobility. The D46 antigen(s) was recovered in the detergent-rich phase of a Triton X-114 extract of granules, suggesting that it is an integral membrane protein. As assessed by the relative activities of marker enzymes, the granules of both the HL60 and HL60-A7 cell lines exhibited a heterogeneous pattern of sedimentation in density gradients. The electrophoretic patterns of the major [2-3H]mannose-labeled glycoproteins of the granule-enriched fractions were similar, except for one diffuse band of 110-170 kD which was not detected in HL60-A7. These studies provide direct evidence for heterogeneity of enzymatic and membrane constituents of primary myeloid granules, and give the first indication that there may be glycoprotein changes associated with certain ultra-structural defects that occur in abnormal promyelocytes. They suggest also, in the example of the D46 antigen; that some glycoproteins may exist in different forms when localized to either the granules or the plasma membrane.","['Peyman, J A', 'Sullivan, A K']","['Peyman JA', 'Sullivan AK']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Azure Stains)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)']",IM,"['Antigens, Surface/*analysis', 'Azure Stains', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromatography, Affinity', 'Cytoplasmic Granules/*immunology', 'Glycoproteins/*immunology', 'Granulocytes/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*immunology', 'Membrane Proteins/analysis']",1987/01/01 00:00,1987/01/01 00:01,['1987/01/01 00:00'],"['1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1987;11(4):385-96. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(87)90185-8.,,['10.1016/0145-2126(87)90185-8 [doi]'],,,,,,

Both pure PDGF at a concentration of 20 ng/ml and fresh serum significantly increased the numbers of BFU-E (p less than 0.01) and CFU-GEMM (p less than 0.014), but not the CFU-GM. That the PDGF effect was not mediated to any significant extent via prostaglandins, was shown by the lack of inhibitory effect of indomethacin on the growth of purified progenitor cells in the presence of fresh serum. Increased amounts of pure PDGF were required to give maximal stimulation of purified CML peripheral blood progenitors compared to normal bone marrow progenitors. These results show that CML progenitors are capable of responding to PDGF. Whether the quantitative difference in response is due to a reduced proportion of mesenchymal cells in CML peripheral blood compared to normal marrow, or whether CML progenitors are most likely already stimulated by autocrime PDGF or other growth factors remains to be elucidated.","['Katz, F E', 'Michalevicz, R', 'Lam, G', 'Hoffbrand, A V', 'Goldman, J M']","['Katz FE', 'Michalevicz R', 'Lam G', 'Hoffbrand AV', 'Goldman JM']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Platelet-Derived Growth Factor)', 'XXE1CET956 (Indomethacin)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Separation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Indomethacin/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Platelet-Derived Growth Factor/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",1987/01/01 00:00,1987/01/01 00:01,['1987/01/01 00:00'],"['1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1987;11(4):339-44. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(87)90178-0.,,['10.1016/0145-2126(87)90178-0 [doi]'],,,,,,

In order to study the effect of extracellular hemin on intracellular ferritin and Hb content, we have used Mossabauer spectroscopy to measure the amount of 57Fe incorporated into ferritin or Hb and a fluorescent enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to measure the ferritin protein content. When K-562 cells were cultured in the presence of a 57Fe source either as transferrin or citrate, in the absence of a differentiation inducer, all the intracellular 57Fe was detected in ferritin. When the cells were cultured in the presence of 57Fe-hemin, 57Fe was found in both ferritin and Hb. 57Fe in ferritin increased rapidly, and after 2 days it reached a plateau at 5 X 10(-14) g/cell. 57Fe in Hb increased linearly with time and reached the same value after 12 days. Addition of other iron sources such as iron-saturated transferrin, iron citrate, or iron ammonium citrate caused a much lower increase in ferritin protein content as compared to hemin. When K-562 cells were induced by 57Fe-hemin in the presence of 56Fe-transferrin, 57Fe was found to be incorporated in equal amounts into both ferritin and Hb. However, when the cells were induced by 56Fe-hemin in the presence of 57Fe-transferrin, 57Fe was incorporated only into ferritin, but not into Hb, which contained 56Fe iron. These results indicate that in K-562 cells, when hemin is present in the culture medium it is preferentially incorporated into Hb, regardless of the availability of other extra- or intracellular iron sources such as transferrin or ferritin. In MEL cells induced to differentiate by dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) a different pattern of iron incorporation was observed; 57Fe from both transferrin and hemin was found to incorporate in ferritin as well as in Hb.","['Fibach, E', 'Konijn, A M', 'Bauminger, R E', 'Ofer, S', 'Rachmilewitz, E A']","['Fibach E', 'Konijn AM', 'Bauminger RE', 'Ofer S', 'Rachmilewitz EA']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Hemoglobins)', '42VZT0U6YR (Heme)', '9007-73-2 (Ferritins)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Ferritins/*biosynthesis', 'Heme/*pharmacology', 'Hemoglobins/*biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Iron/metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Experimental/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Mice', 'Spectrum Analysis']",1987/03/01 00:00,1987/03/01 00:01,['1987/03/01 00:00'],"['1987/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 1987 Mar;130(3):460-5. doi: 10.1002/jcp.1041300321.,,['10.1002/jcp.1041300321 [doi]'],,,,,,

We characterized the cytostatic and cytotoxic effects of recombinant TNF, alone and in combination with actinomycin D (AMD), on the human leukemic cell line HL-60. Because HL-60 cells, when triggered to monocytic differentiation by phorbol esters, are known to produce and secrete TNF, their sensitivity to the factor could indicate an autocrine function of TNF in this cell system. Indeed, HL-60 cells were affected by TNF; their doubling time was increased by about 50% and progression through the cell cycle was perturbed. Initially, (up to 8 h) TNF induced a temporary arrest in G2 while later (24-48 h) it delayed progression through the G1 phase. Also, a transient increase in RNA content peaking at 6-8 h was apparent. The cytotoxicity of TNF alone was low. Thus, TNF may be involved in the regulation of the cell cycle of HL-60 cells during early stages of their differentiation. The cytotoxicity of TNF was markedly potentiated in the presence of AMD; the effect was AMD but not TNF concentration-dependent. Whereas at 20 and 50 ng/ml of AMD alone nonviable cells did not exceed 20% during the first 24 h of treatment, their proportion increased to 80 and 90%, respectively, in the presence of TNF. The most sensitive were cells in the S phase of the cell cycle. The observed synergistic effect of TNF and AMD does not appear to be caused by the action of TNF increasing the permeability of the cell membrane to AMD. The results indicate that HL-60 cells, ordinarily resistant to the cytotoxic action of TNF, can be rendered sensitive by treatment with AMD.

T., James, W., and Zerlauth, G. (1985) J. Cell. Physiol. 123, 401-409). In the present study, we have tested the hypothesis that 1,25-(OH)2D3 increases cellular adhesion by stimulating FN synthesis. Hormone treatment altered cell morphology and increased cell/substratum adhesion in MG-63 cells, effects which could be mimicked by exogenously added FN. 1,25-(OH)2D3-dependent increases in FN production were due to a rapid (within 12 h) increase in FN synthesis. Maximal (2 to 5-fold) stimulation was observed after 48 h. Hormone treatment did not alter apparent FN stability or distribution during this time. The FN response was specific to 1,25-(OH)2D3 when compared with other vitamin D metabolites. In contrast, triamcinolone acetonide, another known inducer of FN synthesis in certain cells, was only slightly stimulatory up to a concentration of 1 microM. FN mRNA, as measured by Northern blot hybridization, increased within 6 h of 1,25-(OH)2D3 addition with maximal (5-fold) induction seen at 24 h. 1,25-(OH)2D3 also stimulated FN synthesis in several other transformed cell lines (TE-85 human osteosarcomas, SW-480 human colon carcinomas, and HL-60 myeloid leukemia cells). These results may be related to known actions of 1,25-(OH)2D3 on cell differentiation and tumor metastasis.","['Franceschi, R T', 'Linson, C J', 'Peter, T C', 'Romano, P R']","['Franceschi RT', 'Linson CJ', 'Peter TC', 'Romano PR']",,['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Fibronectins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'F446C597KA (Triamcinolone Acetonide)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']",IM,"['Calcitriol/*pharmacology', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Colonic Neoplasms/metabolism/pathology', 'Fibronectins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/metabolism/pathology', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Osteosarcoma/metabolism/pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Triamcinolone Acetonide/pharmacology']",1987/03/25 00:00,1987/03/25 00:01,['1987/03/25 00:00'],"['1987/03/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/03/25 00:01 [medline]', '1987/03/25 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1987 Mar 25;262(9):4165-71.,"['AM-313337/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK-35317/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",['S0021-9258(18)61327-4 [pii]'],,,,,,

Since MEL cells can be induced to differentiate in culture, the expression of the chimeric genes was compared to the expression of beta and delta both before and after the induction of erythroid differentiation. The expression of beta delta 1, a beta-globin gene containing delta IVS 1 in place of beta IVS 1, was comparable to the expression of a beta-globin gene both before and after erythroid differentiation. However, the base-line expression of human beta-globin genes containing delta IVS 2 in place of beta IVS 2 was dramatically decreased. Furthermore, the substitution of delta IVS 2 for beta IVS 2 prevented the regulated increase in expression of the beta-globin gene upon induction. The results also indicate that sequences present in beta IVS 2 are not sufficient for this induced increase in expression since the substitution of beta IVS 2 for delta IVS 2 in a delta gene does not increase the regulated expression of delta during differentiation. These experiments suggest that either the presence of delta IVS 2 in a beta gene interrupts sequences required for the induced expression of beta-globin or that sequences in beta IVS 2 act in concert with other beta globin sequences not present in the delta-globin gene to permit optimal expression.","['LaFlamme, S', 'Acuto, S', 'Markowitz, D', 'Vick, L', 'Landschultz, W', 'Bank, A']","['LaFlamme S', 'Acuto S', 'Markowitz D', 'Vick L', 'Landschultz W', 'Bank A']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,['9004-22-2 (Globins)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Chimera', '*Erythropoiesis', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Globins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Introns', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/genetics', 'Mice', 'RNA Splicing', 'Transfection']",1987/04/05 00:00,1987/04/05 00:01,['1987/04/05 00:00'],"['1987/04/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/04/05 00:01 [medline]', '1987/04/05 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1987 Apr 5;262(10):4819-26.,"['AM-07373/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', 'AM-25274/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States']",['S0021-9258(18)61270-0 [pii]'],,,,,,

All five had underlying hematologic malignancy (HM). In a case-control study, these five HM patients (cases) were compared to 10 autopsied HM patients without evidence of aspergillosis or zygomycosis (controls). Cases and controls did not differ in underlying disease or in the degree of immunosuppression, as measured by duration of granulocytopenia and number of platelet transfusions. However, case-patients were more likely than controls to have been hospitalized during the construction of a hospital addition (p less than 0.02, Fisher's exact test [FET]). Four (80%) of five HM patients autopsied during the period of construction had IA or IZ compared with one (5%) of 21 autopsied before construction began (p = 0.001, FET). These findings suggest that, in a population of comparably immunosuppressed patients, construction activity may represent an independent risk factor for IA or IZ. Hospitals caring for such patients should take precautions which minimize exposure of these patients to construction or renovation activity.","['Weems, J J Jr', 'Davis, B J', 'Tablan, O C', 'Kaufman, L', 'Martone, W J']","['Weems JJ Jr', 'Davis BJ', 'Tablan OC', 'Kaufman L', 'Martone WJ']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Infect Control,Infection control : IC,8008357,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Agranulocytosis/complications', 'Aspergillosis/etiology', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*complications', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cross Infection/*etiology', 'Female', '*Hospital Design and Construction', 'Hospitals, Pediatric', 'Humans', 'Immune Tolerance', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/*complications', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/complications', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications', 'Male', 'Mucormycosis/etiology', 'Mycoses/*etiology', 'Opportunistic Infections/etiology', 'Risk']",1987/02/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1987/02/01 00:00'],"['1987/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1987/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Infect Control. 1987 Feb;8(2):71-5. doi: 10.1017/s0195941700067114.,,['10.1017/s0195941700067114 [doi]'],,,,,,

The alteration is referred to as distinctive cytoplasmic surface activity (DCSA). For further delineation, study of 130 consecutively submitted bone marrow specimens was undertaken. All samples were obtained from children and included diverse myeloid leukemias, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, normal marrows, and abnormal but non-neoplastic conditions. The DCSA was composed of simple and complex interconnected tubular elements in continuity with the cytoplasmic membrane, probably, sharing its glycocalyx. The intensity of the DCSA varied but, its presence was detected in one third of the 130 cases. Except for rare marrows (three cases) with DCSA bearing polymorphs, all positive cells were lymphoid in origin, usually originating from non-B, non-T ALL patients. In very few non-neoplastic cases, DCSA-positive lymphocytes also were found. Review of the literature shed little light on the subject but disclosed rare instances in which DCSA was illustrated in benign as well as malignant lymphoid cells. Based on this information and the observations made throughout the study, it is surmised that DCSA may be the morphologic expression of a cellular function, probably a form of micropinocytosis. Despite its prevalence in ALL cases, it appears to be nondiagnostic and nonspecific to a cell line.","['de Chadarevian, J P', 'Corriveau, M']","['de Chadarevian JP', 'Corriveau M']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Hum Pathol,Human pathology,9421547,,IM,"['Bone Marrow/*ultrastructure', 'Cytoplasm/*ultrastructure', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*pathology']",1987/04/01 00:00,1987/04/01 00:01,['1987/04/01 00:00'],"['1987/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Hum Pathol. 1987 Apr;18(4):361-6. doi: 10.1016/s0046-8177(87)80166-1.,,"['S0046-8177(87)80166-1 [pii]', '10.1016/s0046-8177(87)80166-1 [doi]']",,,,,,

In order to investigate this differentiation process further we have studied the expression of the mRNA encoding PDGF-A and PDGF-B (c-sis). Upon addition of the phorbol ester to the culture medium the expression of the c-sis transcript was enhanced about 7-fold over a period of 4 days. With dimethyl sulfoxide there was no significant stimulation of the expression. Addition of cycloheximide to HEL cells treated for a short period with phorbol ester superinduced the expression of the c-sis gene. The HEL cells did not express the A-chain mRNA even in the presence of phorbol ester or dimethyl sulfoxide. This leads us to propose that synthesis of the PDGF-A chain and PDGF-B chain is differentially regulated in the megakaryocytic-like HEL cell line.","['Weich, H A', 'Herbst, D', 'Schairer, H U', 'Hoppe, J']","['Weich HA', 'Herbst D', 'Schairer HU', 'Hoppe J']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,FEBS Lett,FEBS letters,0155157,"['0 (Phorbol Esters)', '0 (Platelet-Derived Growth Factor)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Phorbol Esters/*pharmacology', 'Platelet-Derived Growth Factor/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism']",1987/03/09 00:00,1987/03/09 00:01,['1987/03/09 00:00'],"['1987/03/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/03/09 00:01 [medline]', '1987/03/09 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,FEBS Lett. 1987 Mar 9;213(1):89-94. doi: 10.1016/0014-5793(87)81470-9.,,"['0014-5793(87)81470-9 [pii]', '10.1016/0014-5793(87)81470-9 [doi]']",,,,,,

Counterflow centrifugal elutriation studies have been conducted to obtain a homogeneous cell population with regard to cell-cycle phases and stage of differentiation. Despite their small volume and probably because of their high buoyant density, differentiated cells are elutriated predominantly at higher flow rates. Accordingly, G1 cells elutriated at low flow rates are substantially free from spontaneously differentiating cells. By optimizing the technique, a population with approx. 90% G1 cells and less than 1% spontaneously differentiating cells was obtained. The yield in the fractions chosen was 5.1% of all cells recovered from elutriation. In culture, a cell population of this purity maintains a synchronous cell cycle for more than 2 days. This allows an exact determination of the time after induction when the first signs of differentiation occur.

When 6-MP was administered alone, both the peak plasma concentration (15 to 150 ng X ml-1) and the AUC (36 to 340 ng X ml-1 X hr) were highly variable. Concurrent methotrexate resulted in a 31% increase in the AUC (P less than 0.01) and a 26% increase in peak plasma levels (P less than 0.05) of 6-MP. The AUC of methotrexate correlated with the degree of increase in 6-MP plasma concentrations. These findings are consistent with previous in vitro studies demonstrating that methotrexate is an inhibitor of xanthine oxidase, the enzyme that catabolizes 6-MP to the inactive metabolite thiouric acid. Although the increases in 6-MP AUC and peak plasma concentrations resulting from concurrent methotrexate administration were statistically significant, this interaction is probably not clinically significant at standard low oral doses of methotrexate in light of the wide interpatient variability in these pharmacokinetic parameters of 6-MP.","['Balis, F M', 'Holcenberg, J S', 'Zimm, S', 'Tubergen, D', 'Collins, J M', 'Murphy, R F', 'Gilchrist, G S', 'Hammond, D', 'Poplack, D G']","['Balis FM', 'Holcenberg JS', 'Zimm S', 'Tubergen D', 'Collins JM', 'Murphy RF', 'Gilchrist GS', 'Hammond D', 'Poplack DG']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Clin Pharmacol Ther,Clinical pharmacology and therapeutics,0372741,"['E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Adolescent', 'Biological Availability', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Drug Interactions', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/blood/*metabolism', 'Methotrexate/*pharmacology']",1987/04/01 00:00,1987/04/01 00:01,['1987/04/01 00:00'],"['1987/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Clin Pharmacol Ther. 1987 Apr;41(4):384-7. doi: 10.1038/clpt.1987.45.,,"['0009-9236(87)90123-8 [pii]', '10.1038/clpt.1987.45 [doi]']",,,,,,

The chromosome changes observed in different tissues may reveal the origin of the abnormal clones, as well as provide evidence for distinct or common evolution by different cell populations. The significance of the chromosome abnormalities and their relationship to blastic conversion are discussed. In general, chromosome evolution may be considered a rather reliable predictive or diagnostic parameter of blastic crisis but both the nature and the subsequent behavior of abnormal clones appear to be of critical value. As to the clinical/chromosome correlations, a few major points have emerged: the i(17q) aberration is mostly associated with signs of myeloid differentiation of blasts and a marked basophilia; it is mainly observed in the late stage of the disease, but overall median survival of patients with this marker is usually long; more atypical or complex changes usually are associated with a worse prognosis; patients with only a Ph in their blasts may have a longer survival, at least in some cytologic subgroups; and d) the loss of the Y chromosome seems to protect the cell against further clonal evolution. Finally, the relevance of the chromosome changes in the multistage process of blastic conversion is discussed, and the breakpoints of secondary changes recorded so far are reviewed and examined. It appears that certain chromosome regions are more often affected; these might contain genes of critical importance for the final malignant progression.

Implications for patient management.,25-37,"Chronic myelocytic leukemia (CML) is a model system for the study of many aspects of malignant disease. One aspect that correlates with decreasing therapeutic response is tumor progression. This progression is often accompanied by clonal evolution. In those cases where aggressive therapy does not prevent this evolution, the clinical response to therapy usually proves to be poor and of short duration. Investigators are concentrating their efforts in three primary, but not mutually exclusive, areas with respect to the clinical management of CML. These include: an attempt to distinguish patients at risk for early transformation from those who will have a prolonged chronic phase; the cryopreservation of autologous bone marrow or buffy coat early in chronic phase for subsequent use in the accelerated phase and; endeavors to identify early markers for disease progression allowing intervention before an irreversible blast crisis occurs. This report deals with two types of potential prognostic markers of transformation: chromosomal and cell surface characteristics. The appearance of nonrandom abnormal chromosomal patterns has been correlated with myeloblastic transformation by many investigators. However, there has always been a subset of CML patients who do not undergo clonal evolution. Additionally, the type(s) of transformation in CML may vary depending on the cell lineages involved. Unlike myeloblastic transformants, many of our patients who do not exhibit clonal evolution as a concomitance of disease progression develop a lymphoblastic transformation. Cytofluorometric analysis can distinguish small populations of abnormal cells with lymphoblastic characteristics (HLA DR+). Initial data suggests that patients expressing the HLA DR+ in their ""normal"" peripheral blood cells are at risk of undergoing lymphoblastic transformation. The combined use of clinical, cytogenetic, and cytofluorometric data to predict an impending transformation and to discriminate between myeloblastic and lymphoblastic populations allows clinicians to manage their patients more effectively.","['Fuscaldo, K E', 'Brodsky, I', 'Crilley, P', 'Ligler, F S']","['Fuscaldo KE', 'Brodsky I', 'Crilley P', 'Ligler FS']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,['0 (HLA-DR Antigens)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Blast Crisis', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Female', 'HLA-DR Antigens/analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Prognosis', 'Risk']",1987/05/01 00:00,1987/05/01 00:01,['1987/05/01 00:00'],"['1987/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 1987 May;26(1):25-37. doi: 10.1016/0165-4608(87)90130-0.,,"['0165-4608(87)90130-0 [pii]', '10.1016/0165-4608(87)90130-0 [doi]']",,,,,,

MF is usually a sign of a poor prognosis but its relation to other important parameters of CGL is not known. We observed a 54-year-old, white male patient who was well until May 1983 when he began developing gradually increasing right hip and left shoulder pain. Clinical evaluation 3 months later revealed splenomegaly and a white blood count of 126,000 with 29 segmented neutrophils, 22 bands, 7 metamyelocytes, 11 myelocytes, 6 promyelocytes, 5 blasts, 2 eosinophils, 5 basophils, and 3 lymphocytes. Cytogenetic analysis by G-banding technique showed a male karyotype with all 20 bone marrow cells examined positive for the Philadelphia chromosome. The patient was placed on busulfan therapy with good symptomatic improvement, but later suffered severe thrombocytopenia. At the end of October 1983, he was admitted with blast crisis and thrombocytopenia and was initiated on vincristine and cytosine arabinoside therapy. His bone marrow was repeatedly inaspirable and the biopsy was characterized by diffuse fibrosis. Chromosome analysis of 16 spontaneously dividing cells in the blood at this time revealed that 86% of cells had a karyotype of 46,XY,t(9;22)(q34;q11),t(1;3)(p32;p21) with the rest of the cells having only the Ph chromosome. The patient died 4 months later of intracranial hemorrhage. Chromosome #3 involvement has been reported in acute MF and essential thrombocytosis, but no specific cytogenetic abnormalities have been found in MF associated with CGL.

Median duration of the first CR of the reinduction-responders was significantly longer than that of the second CR (13 versus 6 months). The major determinant for the probability to obtain a second CR after reinduction therapy was the duration of the first CR. The latter was significantly longer in the reinduction-responders than in the nonresponding group (13 versus 5 months).

Leukemic blasts from 45 previously untreated patients obtained prior to therapy were cultured in vitro in autologous pretreatment serum (APS) and in serum containing drug-induced humoral stimulatory activity (HSA). Cell populations cultured in HSA demonstrated both increased proliferation, as measured by both [3H]dThd incorporation into DNA and [3H]dThd leukemic blast labeling index, and greater [3H] ara-C leukemic blast labeling index relative to cells maintained in APS. HSA-cultured marrow cells from the 31 patients who achieved complete remission with ara-C-containing therapy demonstrated enhanced intracellular formation of ara-C 5'-triphosphate over three hours and retention of this active form during one subsequent hour in drug-free medium relative to cells maintained in APS. In contrast, cells from the 14 nonresponsive patients demonstrated no such HSA-induced increases in intracellular ara-C metabolism. These studies of human AML marrow cells identify behavior patterns of ara-C activation and net metabolism in the kinetically perturbed, proliferative state that may discriminate clinical sensitivity from clinical resistance to ara-C-based timed sequential therapy. Sensitive AML populations behave similarly to normal hematopoietic cohorts, with direct linkage of HSA-perturbed growth and pharmacologic parameters, while refractory cells demonstrate uncoupling of these determinants in the growth-stimulated state. These in vitro measurements may further serve as a template for prediction of clinical outcome to timed sequential therapy with ara-C, where both pharmacologic and cytokinetic determinants of response are intrinsic to the success of the designed drug scheduling.","['Karp, J E', 'Donehower, R C', 'Dole, G B', 'Burke, P J']","['Karp JE', 'Donehower RC', 'Dole GB', 'Burke PJ']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '13191-15-6 (Arabinofuranosylcytosine Triphosphate)']",IM,"['Arabinofuranosylcytosine Triphosphate/biosynthesis', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Cells', '*Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytarabine/*metabolism/therapeutic use', 'DNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Drug Resistance', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Prognosis']",1987/04/01 00:00,1987/04/01 00:01,['1987/04/01 00:00'],"['1987/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1987 Apr;69(4):1134-40.,"['CA06973/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA40187/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['S0006-4971(20)80630-2 [pii]'],,,,,,

Using [35S]methionine as well as monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies to glycoprotein IIb and IIIa, we have demonstrated synthesis of these two glycoproteins by this cell line. When Triton X-100-solubilized membranes were subjected to cross immunoelectrophoresis in 1% agarose, using a mixture of polyclonal antibodies to glycoproteins IIb and IIIa, a single peak was seen in the presence of Ca2+, whereas two distinct peaks were seen in the presence of 5 mM EDTA.

When either the electrophoresis or the subsequent overlay was done in the presence of 5 mM EDTA, no 125I-fibrinogen binding was observed. These studies demonstrate that HEL cells contain glycoproteins IIb and IIIa capable of forming a Ca2+-dependent complex and capable of binding fibrinogen in a Ca2+-dependent reaction.

Role of guanine O6 alkylation in the mechanism of cytotoxicity of imidazotetrazinones.,457-62,"Cell lines with constitutive levels of the DNA repair protein O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (O6MeGMT) (Mer+ phenotype) were less sensitive to the cytotoxic effects of the imidazotetrazinone mitozolomide and the methyl analogue (CCRG 81045) than cells lacking the repair enzyme (Mer-). In contrast neither chlorambucil or the ethylimidazotetrazinone (CCRG 82019) showed differential toxicity between Mer+ and Mer- cell lines. When Mer+ cell lines were incubated with the free base O6-methylguanine (O6MeG) for 16 hr there was a depletion of O6MeGMT, which was dose-related. Such cells showed an increased sensitivity to both mitozolamide and CCRG 81045, but not to CCRG 82019. The only Mer+ cell line not showing increased sensitization with O6MeG pretreatment was Raji, where O6MeGMT was shown to reappear after addition of CCRG 81045. These results suggest that the chloroethyl and methylimidazole-triazinones are similar to the nitrosoureas and triazenes in that cytotoxicity correlates with alkylation of the O6-position of guanine, while the ethyl analogues appear to produce an alternate cytotoxic lesion.","['Tisdale, M J']",['Tisdale MJ'],,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Nitrogen Mustard Compounds)', '18D0SL7309 (Chlorambucil)', '5Z93L87A1R (Guanine)', '7GR28W0FJI (Dacarbazine)', '97716-74-0 (ethazolastone)', '9B710FV2AE (O-(6)-methylguanine)', 'E3U7286V3W (mitozolomide)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.63 (O(6)-Methylguanine-DNA Methyltransferase)', 'YF1K15M17Y (Temozolomide)']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/drug therapy', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Line', 'Chlorambucil/therapeutic use', 'Colonic Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'DNA Repair', '*Dacarbazine/*analogs & derivatives', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Guanine/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/*therapeutic use', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy', 'Lung Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Methyltransferases/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Nitrogen Mustard Compounds/*therapeutic use', 'O(6)-Methylguanine-DNA Methyltransferase', 'Phenotype', 'Temozolomide']",1987/02/15 00:00,1987/02/15 00:01,['1987/02/15 00:00'],"['1987/02/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/02/15 00:01 [medline]', '1987/02/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1987 Feb 15;36(4):457-62. doi: 10.1016/0006-2952(87)90351-0.,,"['0006-2952(87)90351-0 [pii]', '10.1016/0006-2952(87)90351-0 [doi]']",,,,,,

Samples for FCM analysis were centrifuged and exposed to a hypotonic solution containing detergent and propidium iodide, a DNA intercalating fluorescent stain. Aneuploidy as well as cytologic malignancy were found in 17 samples. Forty-seven samples had normal DNA histograms by FCM and were also cytologically negative. Four samples suspicious by cytology but normal by FCM were from patients with renal-cell carcinoma (two samples from the same patient), endometrial adenocarcinoma without metastasis and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Three samples abnormal by FCM but negative by cytology were from patients with ovarian cystadenoma, cirrhosis and uterine leiomyoma. FCM showed aneuploidy in four cytologically negative samples from patients with histologically proven malignancy (lymphoma, colonic adenocarcinoma, cervical squamous cell carcinoma, and endometrial adenosquamous carcinoma). Based on these results, FCM analysis combined with conventional cytopathology yielded 100% sensitivity, 100% predictive value of a negative result and 94% specificity.

Magnetic monodisperse microspheres (Dynabeads TM) were coated with monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) specific for the CD8 T cell antigen or for HLA class II monomorphic epitopes. They could then be used to obtain HLA class I or class II positive cells directly from ACD blood in approximately 15 min by the use of magnetic separation. The cells (attached to the microspheres) were subsequently used in microcytotoxic HLA typing (total incubation time of 55 min) using acridin orange/ethidiumbromide to stain viable (yellow) and dead (red) cells. It was found that this immunomagnetic (IM) HLA typing technique was specific, has a sensitivity superior to that observed for conventional microcytotoxicity assays and gave low background staining. IM HLA-ABC typing of 50 healthy donors and 10 patients and IM HLA-DR typing of 25 healthy donors and 30 patients gave results corresponding well with that obtained independently by conventional HLA typing (concordancy rates 92-100%). Furthermore, the IM HLA typing technique permitted reliable HLA class II typing of blood cells from six patients where conventional HLA class II typing was impossible. The IM HLA typing technique also enables HLA class I and II typing to be quickly and reliably performed on cells from ACD blood of cadaveric donors.","['Vartdal, F', 'Gaudernack, G', 'Funderud, S', 'Bratlie, A', 'Lea, T', 'Ugelstad, J', 'Thorsby, E']","['Vartdal F', 'Gaudernack G', 'Funderud S', 'Bratlie A', 'Lea T', 'Ugelstad J', 'Thorsby E']",,['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Tissue Antigens,Tissue antigens,0331072,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (HLA-D Antigens)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Blood Cells/immunology', 'Cadaver', 'Cell Separation/*methods', 'Cross Reactions', 'Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic/methods', 'HLA Antigens/*analysis', 'HLA-D Antigens/*analysis', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/blood', 'Magnetics', 'Time Factors']",1986/11/01 00:00,1986/11/01 00:01,['1986/11/01 00:00'],"['1986/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Tissue Antigens. 1986 Nov;28(5):301-12. doi: 10.1111/j.1399-0039.1986.tb00500.x.,,['10.1111/j.1399-0039.1986.tb00500.x [doi]'],,,,,,

The c-myb proto-oncogene has been mapped to region 6q21-24, which suggests that it could be involved in the 6q- aberrations. By means of in situ chromosomal hybridization on cells from six hematopoietic malignancies, it was demonstrated that the c-myb locus is not deleted, but is retained on band q22, which is consistently bordered by the chromosomal breakpoints in both interstitial and terminal 6q- deletions. The deletion breakpoints were located at some distance from the myb locus since no rearrangement of c-myb sequences was found. In one case, however, amplification of the entire c-myb locus was detectable. Furthermore, in all cases tested that carry 6q- deletions, myb messenger RNA levels were significantly higher than in normal cells or in malignant cells matched for lineage and stage of differentiation but lacking the 6q- marker. These results indicate that 6q- deletions are accompanied by structural and functional alterations of the c-myb locus and that these alterations may be involved in the pathogenesis of leukemias and lymphomas.","['Barletta, C', 'Pelicci, P G', 'Kenyon, L C', 'Smith, S D', 'Dalla-Favera, R']","['Barletta C', 'Pelicci PG', 'Kenyon LC', 'Smith SD', 'Dalla-Favera R']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Science,"Science (New York, N.Y.)",0404511,"['0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['*Chromosome Deletion', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 6', 'DNA/genetics', 'Gene Amplification', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*genetics', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics']",1987/02/27 00:00,1987/02/27 00:01,['1987/02/27 00:00'],"['1987/02/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/02/27 00:01 [medline]', '1987/02/27 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Science. 1987 Feb 27;235(4792):1064-7. doi: 10.1126/science.3469751.,['CA16239/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['10.1126/science.3469751 [doi]'],,,,,,

Helper cell clones which produced a high viral titer were generated by a simplified method which minimizes cell culture. We used the pZIP-NeoSV(X) vector containing a human hprt cDNA. Viral titers (1 X 10(3) to 5 X 10(4)/ml) of defective SVX HPRT B, a vector containing both the hprt and neo genes, were increased 3- to 10-fold by cocultivation of the ecotropic psi 2 and amphotropic PA-12 helper cells. Higher viral titers (8 X 10(5) to 7.5 X 10(6] were obtained when nonproducer NIH 3T3 cells or psi 2 cells carrying a single copy of SVX HPRT B were either transfected or infected by Moloney leukemia virus. The SVX HPRT B defective virus partially corrected the HPRT deficiency (4 to 56% of normal) of cultured rodent and human Lesch-Nyhan cells. However, instability of HPRT expression was detected in several infected clones. In these unstable variants, both retention and loss of the SVX HPRT B sequences were observed. In the former category, cells which became HPRT- (6-thioguanine resistant [6TGr]) also became G418s, indicative of a cis-acting down regulation of expression. Both hypoxanthine-aminopterin-thymidine resistance (HATr) and G418r could be regained by counterselection in hypoxanthine-aminopterin-thymidine.

In contrast, terminated radiation-exposure regimens (continuous exposure terminated after accumulation of preset total radiation doses) markedly reduce leukemogenic potential. In this study, we examined leukemic incidences and postnatal hematopoietic function in three groups of dogs; continuously irradiated (7.5 cGy/day) during both fetal life and after birth, continuously irradiated during fetal life only, and nonirradiated. Results were compared to results from studies with similarly irradiated and nonirradiated groups of young adult dogs initially tested at 400 days of age. Hematopoietic function was assessed in terms of both circulating blood levels of red cells, platelets, granulocytes, and monocytes, and marrow concentrations and radiosensitivities of hematopoietic progenitors. Results indicated that under continuous fetal/postnatal irradiation, i.e. the high leukemogenic exposure regimen, a marked, progressive suppression in hematopoietic function occurred following birth. This suppression continued to 100-150 days of age and was followed by partial hematopoietic recovery that was associated with an acquired radioresistance by hematopoietic progenitors. In contrast, neonates that had been continuously irradiated during fetal life, but not postnatally, i.e. the low leukemogenic regimen, exhibited a similar initial suppression of hematopoietic function followed by partial recovery. However, no temporally linked acquisition of radioresistance by hematopoietic progenitors was demonstrated. These results support the hypothesis, developed from earlier studies with adult dogs, that the processes of acquired radioresistance and recovery in numbers of transformable hematopoietic progenitors are causally linked to early stages of the leukemogenic process under continuous ionizing irradiation.","['Seed, T M', 'Kaspar, L V', 'Tolle, D V', 'Fritz, T E']","['Seed TM', 'Kaspar LV', 'Tolle DV', 'Fritz TE']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,,IM,"['Animals', 'Blood Platelets/radiation effects', 'Dogs', 'Female', 'Granulocytes/radiation effects', 'Hematopoiesis/radiation effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/radiation effects', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/etiology/pathology', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/*pathology', 'Monocytes/radiation effects', 'Pregnancy', '*Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects']",1987/01/01 00:00,1987/01/01 00:01,['1987/01/01 00:00'],"['1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1987;11(2):171-9. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(87)90023-3.,,['10.1016/0145-2126(87)90023-3 [doi]'],,,,,,

Moreover, this elevation was also seen in relapsed cases even if their blood (unlike bone marrow) was devoid of blasts.

The monoclonal antibodies have specificity for a cytoplasmic and cell surface Friend-Moloney-Rauscher group-specific antigen. Immunoelectron microscopy revealed antibody binding to the surface of virus-expressing cells but not to the budding virus particles. Treatment of M-MuSV-injected mice with monoclonal IgM anti-M-MuSV significantly inhibited tumor growth compared to virus-inoculated animals receiving either saline or MOPC 104E. Nude mice exhibited delayed tumor induction following treatment with the monoclonal antibodies but ultimately died from tumor growth. Virus-injected euthymic mice that were treated with monoclonal IgM anti-M-MuSV generated a potentiated spleen cell-mediated cytotoxicity against Moloney sarcoma cells compared to virus-infected treated with saline. This potentiation of cytotoxicity remained after trypsinization of the spleen cells and thus was probably not due to passively adsorbed monoclonal antibody. The antibodies alone or in the presence of complement did not neutralize M-MuLV. The IgM antibodies induced specific tumor cell cytotoxicity in vitro mediated by complement spleen cells, lymph node cells, or thymus cells. In conclusion, two monoclonal IgM anti-M-MuSV antibodies that bind to the tumor cell surface did not neutralize virus can inhibit primary M-MuSV-induced tumor growth in vivo.

Secondary leukemia occurred in 22 nonreferred individuals compared to 1.52 expected, based on general population rates [relative risk (RR) = 14; 95% confidence interval (CI), 9-22]. The influence of therapy for the first cancer on subsequent leukemia risk was determined by a case-control study conducted on 25 cases and 90 matched controls. Treatment with alkylating agents was associated with a significantly elevated risk of leukemia (RR = 4.8; 95% CI, 1.2-18.9). A strong dose-response relationship was also observed between leukemia risk and total dose of alkylating agents, estimated by an alkylator score. The RR of leukemia reached 23 in the highest dose category. Radiation therapy, however, did not increase risk. Although doxorubicin was also identified as a possible risk factor, the excess risk of leukemia following treatment for childhood cancer appears almost entirely due to alkylating agents.","['Tucker, M A', 'Meadows, A T', 'Boice, J D Jr', 'Stovall, M', 'Oberlin, O', 'Stone, B J', 'Birch, J', 'Voute, P A', 'Hoover, R N', 'Fraumeni, J F Jr']","['Tucker MA', 'Meadows AT', 'Boice JD Jr', 'Stovall M', 'Oberlin O', 'Stone BJ', 'Birch J', 'Voute PA', 'Hoover RN', 'Fraumeni JF Jr']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,"['0 (Alkylating Agents)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['Alkylating Agents/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Doxorubicin/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hodgkin Disease/drug therapy/radiotherapy', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/*chemically induced', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/radiotherapy', 'Risk']",1987/03/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1987/03/01 00:00'],"['1987/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1987/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1987 Mar;78(3):459-64.,['N01CP-91049/CP/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,

Although CR was not achieved in any patients with acute leukemia, and PR was in three (33.3%), it was found that etoposide was most effective for the patients with the M4 or M5 subtype in the FAB classification. The most serious adverse effect of the drug was leukopenia in patients with lymphoma. In three patients (30.0%), the leukocyte count was lower than 1,000/mm3. Gastrointestinal complications, such as anorexia, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea occurred in 60.7% of all patients, but were not serious. Alopecia was observed in 73.1%. Intravenous administration of etoposide was apparently effective for the patients with malignant lymphoma of the diffuse mixed type, and this efficacy found in our study was the same as that for oral administration of etoposide reported by us previously.","['Tagawa, S', 'Kitani, T', 'Nagai, K', 'Kanamaru, A', 'Kohsaki, M', 'Masaoka, T', 'Shibata, H', 'Horiuchi, A', 'Tsubaki, K', 'Kawagoe, H']","['Tagawa S', 'Kitani T', 'Nagai K', 'Kanamaru A', 'Kohsaki M', 'Masaoka T', 'Shibata H', 'Horiuchi A', 'Tsubaki K', 'Kawagoe H', 'et al.']",,['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Gan No Rinsho,Gan no rinsho.

Mechanism of enhancing activity of colony formation.,355-63,"Elevated proportions of monocytes have previously been found in the blood of healthy women during the ovulation period as well as in other conditions associated with increased blood estradiol (E2). This phenomenon was explained, in part, by an augmenting effect which physiological concentrations of E2 may have on the development of granulocyte-macrophage (GM) colonies derived from normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells. To analyze this effect, we tested possible alternatives for the interaction between E2, colony-stimulating factor (CSF) and GM colony progenitor cells. E2 was found not to interact synergistically with CSF, but pre-treatment of the progenitor cells with E2 resulted in higher numbers of colonies in response to CSF. Moreover, E2 did not induce higher secretion of CSF but treatment with anti-CSF antibodies abolished the enhancing effect of E2. Based on these results, we suggest that the augmenting effect of E2 on GM colony formation is mediated by inducing the colony precursor cells to be more responsive to CSF. These findings may help to elucidate some of the complex relationships between estrogens, immune responses and hemopoiesis.","['Barak, V', 'Biran, S', 'Halimi, M', 'Treves, A J']","['Barak V', 'Biran S', 'Halimi M', 'Treves AJ']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Ireland,J Reprod Immunol,Journal of reproductive immunology,8001906,"['0 (Culture Media)', '4TI98Z838E (Estradiol)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Cell Aggregation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Culture Media', 'Estradiol/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'Monocytes/*cytology/drug effects']",1986/12/01 00:00,1986/12/01 00:01,['1986/12/01 00:00'],"['1986/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Reprod Immunol. 1986 Dec;9(4):355-63. doi: 10.1016/0165-0378(86)90035-5.,,"['0165-0378(86)90035-5 [pii]', '10.1016/0165-0378(86)90035-5 [doi]']",,,,,,

Vaccines containing only one of these peptides (single-peptide vaccines) as well as multi-peptide vaccines containing pep1, -4, -5 or pep1, -2, -3, -4, -5 were used. Whereas the immunizations with single-peptide vaccines did not protect the immunized mice from FLV-induced erythroleukaemia, multi-peptide vaccines enhanced the survival rate and incubation period after FLV challenge.

No such expression has been detected in induced granulocytic cells. In striking contrast to these observations, we found that c-fos mRNA levels are very high in purified human granulocytes, but barely detectable in blood monocytes and tissue macrophages. Human granulocytes contain, however, relatively low levels of c-fos protein, indicating that c-fos mRNA is inefficiently translated or that the protein is rapidly degraded in these cells. In closer agreement with the in vitro results, the level of the expression of c-fms is high in purified blood monocytes and undetectable in granulocytes. We found, however, that the evolution of monocytes into tissue macrophages is accompanied by a significant decrease in c-fms expression, suggesting that the function of c-fms is restricted to specific stages of monocytic differentiation.

The unfixed nuclei were sensitive to digestion at around 10 micrograms/ml, the fixed cells at 30 ng/ml DNase I concentration. Proliferating Rauscher leukemia cells were more digestible than normal spleen cells. The DNase I sensitivity of the human HL60 leukemia line decreased upon DMSO-induced differentiation but still exceeded the digestibility of nuclei from normal human peripheral blood. A novel flow-cytometric technique was developed to study DNase sensitivity at the cell level. It confirmed the relative resistance of differentiated cells to DNase I and ruled out the possibility that this could be due to an altered distribution of cell cycle phases. The overall DNase I sensitivity of chromatin was compared with the sensitivity of the c-myc gene and the myc-associated hypersensitive sites. The latter sites were detected at 1 microgram/ml DNase I in HL60 nuclei. They disappeared partially upon DMSO-induced differentiation. At 10 micrograms/ml, myc was degraded in both growing and differentiating HL60, but not in HPB cells. These data suggest that a progressive condensation of the chromatin occurs during terminal differentiation which gradually involves specific genes that need to be inactivated.","['Szabo, G Jr', 'Damjanovich, S', 'Sumegi, J', 'Klein, G']","['Szabo G Jr', 'Damjanovich S', 'Sumegi J', 'Klein G']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (Chromatin)', 'EC 3.1.21.1 (Deoxyribonuclease I)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatin/*ultrastructure', 'Deoxyribonuclease I/*metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/pathology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Spleen/*cytology']",1987/03/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1987/03/01 00:00'],"['1987/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1987/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 1987 Mar;169(1):158-68. doi: 10.1016/0014-4827(87)90234-5.,['2RO1 CA 14054-13A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['0014-4827(87)90234-5 [pii]', '10.1016/0014-4827(87)90234-5 [doi]']",,,,,,

Three hemophiliacs with strongly positive reactions received injections of a U.S.-produced factor VIII; all are asymptomatic currently. A patient with hairy cell leukemia had a markedly elevated ELISA reading. Another patient with syphilis also had a markedly high reading, despite having no other known risk factor. Among the low-risk groups a patient who had suffered from oral candidiasis for eight years had no risk factor, yet he yielded repeatedly high ELISA readings. Another patient with a weak positive reaction was a symptomless blood donor. This preliminary study concludes that Taiwan is several years behind the U.S. and is at present not an endemic area for AIDS.

Resistance to m-AMSA developed in a triphasic process and was accompanied by a slightly slower growth rate and cloning efficiency and a more differentiated morphological phenotype. Extensive chromosomal rearrangement also took place. Among other chromosomal aberrations, one of the No. 6 homologues showed an added segment on the long arm in the form of an homogeneously staining region. One of the homologues of chromosome 14 in every cell showed a deletion of the distal end of the long arm that was replaced by an unidentified homogeneously staining segment. Membrane-associated 170 kd glycoprotein was not overexpressed in the resistant cells, which together with an absence of cross-resistance to Vinca alkaloids and anthracyclines points toward a mechanism of resistance different from multidrug resistance. The ability of resistant cells to respond to differentiation-inducing agents was not significantly changed as compared with that of the parental line. Growth of resistant cells in the absence of m-AMSA for over 200 population doublings within a period of more than 1.5 years did not result in reversion of the resistance, suggesting a stable genomic change. Resistance was not due to a decrease in the bioavailability of the drug. Uptake of [14C]m-AMSA by either whole cells or isolated nuclei of resistant cells exceeded that of the parental cell line, and outward transport of the drug was not more active; thus there were higher levels of intracellularly bound drug. The cell line represents an excellent model for studies of the mechanisms of resistance to m-AMSA and its modulation in human myelogenous leukemia.","['Beran, M', 'Andersson, B S']","['Beran M', 'Andersson BS']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['00DPD30SOY (Amsacrine)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['Amsacrine/metabolism/*toxicity', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Doxorubicin/toxicity', 'Drug Resistance', 'Karyotyping', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*pathology', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay', 'Vinblastine/toxicity']",1987/04/01 00:00,1987/04/01 00:01,['1987/04/01 00:00'],"['1987/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1987 Apr 1;47(7):1897-904.,,,,,,,,

This imbalance includes decreased ratios of purine:pyrimidine, adenine:guanine, and uracil:cytosine nucleotides as well as an increased relative concentration and a changed composition of the uridine diphosphate (UDP) sugars, with relatively more UDP-N-acetylhexosamines. Similar, more prominent deviations were found in HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cell line cells. We have used HL-60 cells to investigate the relationships between these changes in the ribonucleotide pools and myelocyte proliferation, maturation, and/or transformation to the malignant state. When HL-60 cells were separated by elutriation centrifugation into fractions enriched in G1, S phase, or G2 + M, we found only differences in the amount of nucleotides per cell (G2 + M greater than S phase greater than G1) corresponding with the increase in cell volume but not in the qualitative composition of the nucleotides. Therefore, throughout this study, the nucleotide content of all cells was calculated per unit of cell volume. When HL-60 cells were induced to myeloid differentiation with dimethyl sulfoxide, proliferation stopped after 3 days. After 6 days, 70-90% of the cells had matured into cells capable of nitro blue tetrazolium reduction upon stimulation with phorbol myristate acetate. During the maturation process, the mean volume of the HL-60 cells decreased, and the nucleotide content and the purine:pyrimidine and adenine:guanine nucleotide ratios increased. The composition of the UDP sugars changed dramatically, with a decrease of UDP-N-acetylhexosamines and an increase of UDP-hexoses. Similar changes were detected in HL-60 cells that stopped proliferating without dimethyl sulfoxide-induced maturation, except that the UDP sugar composition showed an increase of UDP-N-acetylhexosamines and a decrease of UDP-hexoses. Careful examination of these results indicates that the decreased ratio of purine:pyrimidine nucleotides and the decreased ratio of uracil:cytosine nucleotides observed in CML myeloblasts may be regarded as specific changes caused by transformation of myelocytes to the malignant state. The increased amount of UDP-N-acetylhexosamines and total UDP sugars in the CML cells may also be connected with the transformation process. All other deviations in the nucleotide pattern of transformed myelocytes in comparison to that of mature, normal neutrophils can be explained by the state of proliferation and/or immaturity of CML myeloblasts and HL-60 cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['de Korte, D', 'Haverkort, W A', 'de Boer, M', 'van Gennip, A H', 'Roos, D']","['de Korte D', 'Haverkort WA', 'de Boer M', 'van Gennip AH', 'Roos D']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,['0 (Nucleotides)'],IM,"['Cell Cycle', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism', 'Nucleotides/*metabolism']",1987/04/01 00:00,1987/04/01 00:01,['1987/04/01 00:00'],"['1987/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1987 Apr 1;47(7):1841-7.,,,,,,,,

Morphological differentiation of c-WRT-7 cells was observed in diffusion chambers which had been inserted into the abdominal cavity of syngeneic WKA rats given injections of LPS. A series of i.p. injections of LPS resulted in the complete inhibition of the leukemia development in about 60% of the rats while the remaining rats showed a significant prolongation of survival time when they were given i.p. injections of LPS-sensitive c-WRT-7 cells. The effect of LPS was minimal, however, in those rats which had been given i.p. injections of LPS-hyporesponsive c-WRT-7 cells. Although an i.v. injection of 100 untreated c-WRT-7 cells was enough to kill the syngeneic rats, combination treatment with LPS and daunomycin was able to inhibit completely the development of leukemia in those rats which had been given i.v. injections of LPS-sensitive c-WRT-7 cells, whereas the same treatments were only partially effective in the prolongation of survival among those rats which had been given i.v. injections of LPS-hyporesponsive c-WRT-7 cells.

HL60/MRI is much more sensitive to RA than is HL60. Thus, the RA concentrations that induce 50% differentiation are 0.41 nM for HL60/MRI and 37 nM for HL60, and maximum differentiation occurs at 2 days for HL60/MRI and at 4 days for HL60. While RA induces HL60/MRI to monocytoid cells, other inducers of granulocytic differentiation of HL60, such as dimethyl sulfoxide and hexamethylene bisacetamide, induce HL60/MRI to granulocytes.

We report here the characterization of a human leukemic cell line (CEM/VM-1) with ""atypical"" multiple drug resistance: despite resistance and cross-resistance to etoposide, anthracyclines, mitoxantrone, and 4'-[(9-acridinyl)amino]methanesulphon-m-anisidide (mAMSA), these cells retain sensitivity to the Vinca alkaloids. Further, even though this cell line is approximately equal to 40-fold cross-resistant to the cytotoxic effect of etoposide (VP-16), it is similar to drug-sensitive CEM cells in the cellular pharmacology of [3H]VP-16 as determined by zero time binding, initial influx rate, steady state drug concentration, and unidirectional efflux. Our studies suggest that the resistance of CEM/VM-1 cells to epipodophyllotoxins is due to an altered interaction between drug and its cellular target(s) by a mechanism unrelated to the decreased cellular concentration of drug associated with the ""classic"" multiple drug resistance phenotype.","['Danks, M K', 'Yalowich, J C', 'Beck, W T']","['Danks MK', 'Yalowich JC', 'Beck WT']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['957E6438QA (Teniposide)', 'L36H50F353 (Podophyllotoxin)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Drug Resistance', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/metabolism/*pathology', 'Podophyllotoxin/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Teniposide/metabolism/*pharmacology']",1987/03/01 00:00,1987/03/01 00:01,['1987/03/01 00:00'],"['1987/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1987 Mar 1;47(5):1297-301.,"['CA06795/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA30103/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,

Twenty-eight children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia who survived for more than 2 years were examined for the assessment of neurotoxicity induced by CNS prophylaxis and its treatment. The patients were stratified into three groups: Stratum I, prophylaxis with methotrexate; Stratum II, prophylaxis with cranial irradiation with methotrexate; and Stratum III, with CNS leukemia. Once CNS disease developed the sequelae were frequent and severe, due to the elevated methotrexate levels in the cerebrospinal fluid. CNS prophylaxis with intermediate-dose methotrexate was less toxic to the developing CNS than prophylactic cranial irradiation, especially in children under 5 years of age. Electroencephalograms and evoked potentials are likely to find increasing application in defining the CNS sequelae of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in children and its treatment.

Pulse exposure to mitozantrone for 30 min invariably caused strand breaks. In the cell lines JM 1, KM3 and RPM I 8420 DNA strand breakage was progressive upon further incubation in drug free medium. These cell lines were killed by pulse exposure to mitozantrone. In the cell lines Molt 4, Daudi, Raji and HL-60, the DNA strand breaks induced by mitozantone were only moderate and these cell lines were also resistant to killing by mitozantrone in vitro. The leukaemic cells of one of the seven patients behaved also like the cell lines that were sensitive and a complete remission was achieved in this patient using mitozantrone as single agent therapy. The other patients with a pattern similar to the resistant cell lines proved to be clinically refractory. Thus mitozantrone induces rapidly progressive DNA strand breaks as early as 30 min in leukaemic cells that are sensitive. The measurement of DNA strand breaks by the fluorometric analysis of DNA unwinding is a rapid method which might predict response to drugs whose major effect is on the induction of strand breaks.","['Ho, A D', 'Seither, E', 'Ma, D D', 'Prentice, H G']","['Ho AD', 'Seither E', 'Ma DD', 'Prentice HG']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', '*DNA Damage', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy', 'Lymphoma/*genetics/pathology', 'Mitoxantrone/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Time Factors']",1987/01/01 00:00,1987/01/01 00:01,['1987/01/01 00:00'],"['1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1987 Jan;65(1):51-5. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1987.tb06134.x.,,['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1987.tb06134.x [doi]'],,,,,,

Analysis of survival and prognostic features.,23-9,"The prognostic value of biological, clinical and laboratory features was analysed in a series of 265 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) and prolymphocytic leukaemia (PLL). On univariate analysis seven features were shown to influence significantly the survival of the whole group of patients: absolute prolymphocyte count (ABS PROL), percentage of prolymphocytes (%PROL), WBC, spleen size, age, intensity of surface-membrane immunoglobulin (SmIg) and mouse (M) rosettes. Multivariate regression analysis of these features showed that only ABS PROL and spleen size had independent prognostic significance. The survival in PLL (38 cases) was significantly shorter than in CLL (227 cases) (median survival = 3 and 8 years, respectively). Patients with CLL with an increased %PROL (11-55%), defined as CLL/PL, could be divided into two groups: those with ABS PROL less than or equal to 15 X 10(9)/l (26 cases) fell within the 'standard-prognostic risk' for typical CLL (i.e. less than or equal to 10% PROL), whereas the survival outlook for the cases with ABS PROL greater than 15 X 10(9)/l (40 cases) was as bad as for PLL. A scoring system was generated with the four features that showed high prognostic significance: ABS PROL, spleen size, SmIg and M-rosettes. The score proved to be superior to any single feature as a predictor of survival, being especially useful in the analysis of the CLL/PL group: cases with high scores (greater than 2) had a median survival of 2.5 years, while the median has not been reached for those with low scores (less than or equal to 2). We suggest that this scoring system may help to identify the cases of CLL/PL that behave as PLL, and as such may benefit from different treatment.","['Melo, J V', 'Catovsky, D', 'Gregory, W M', 'Galton, D A']","['Melo JV', 'Catovsky D', 'Gregory WM', 'Galton DA']",,['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,IM,"['Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/blood/*mortality', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Prognosis']",1987/01/01 00:00,1987/01/01 00:01,['1987/01/01 00:00'],"['1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1987 Jan;65(1):23-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1987.tb06130.x.,,['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1987.tb06130.x [doi]'],,,,,,

Evaluation of daunomycin and puromycin conjugates in vitro.,165-74,"During recent years N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide (HPMA) copolymers have been developed as targetable drug carriers. These soluble synthetic polymers are internalized by cells by pinocytosis and they can be tailor-made to include peptidyl side-chains degradable intracellularly by specific lysosomal enzymes. Thus they provide the opportunity fo achieve controlled intracellular delivery of anticancer agents. The anthracycline antibiotic daunomycin, and protein synthesis inhibitor puromycin, were bound to HPMA copolymers via several different peptide side-chains, including Gly-Gly, Gly-Phe-Leu-Gly and Gly-Phe-Phe-Leu. Incubation of polymer-drug conjugates with isolated lysosomal enzymes (either a mixture of rat liver lysosomal enzymes or purified thiol-dependent lysosomal proteinases, cathepsins L and B) showed that significant release of drug occurred over 20 h, more than 20% of daunomycin and more than 80% of puromycin being liberated. To test their pharmacological activity conjugates were incubated with either the mouse leukaemia L1210, or the human lymphoblastoid leukaemia CCRF in vitro. The conjugates tested were all less effective than free daunomycin, but they showed differential toxicity against L1210 depending on the aminoacid sequence of their drug-polymer linkage. Inclusion of fucosylamine-terminating side-chains into the HPMA copolymer structure increased the affinity of conjugates for the L1210 cell membrane and resulted in increased toxicity. In contrast HPMA-daunomycin conjugates with or without fucosylamine affected CCRF cells equally, but this cell line was more sensitive than the mouse leukaemia to both free and polymer-bound daunomycin. Incubation of L1210 cells in polymer-bound daunomycin for 72 h, followed by plating cells out in low density in drug-free medium, showed that a concentration of polymer-bound drug (184 micrograms ml-1) could be selected to achieve a cytotoxic effect.","['Duncan, R', 'Kopeckova-Rejmanova, P', 'Strohalm, J', 'Hume, I', 'Cable, H C', 'Pohl, J', 'Lloyd, J B', 'Kopecek, J']","['Duncan R', 'Kopeckova-Rejmanova P', 'Strohalm J', 'Hume I', 'Cable HC', 'Pohl J', 'Lloyd JB', 'Kopecek J']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (Acrylates)', '0 (Methacrylates)', '0 (Pharmaceutical Vehicles)', '4A6ZS6Q2CL (Puromycin)', 'UKW89XAX2X (hydroxypropyl methacrylate)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Acrylates/*administration & dosage', 'Animals', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Chemical Phenomena', 'Chemistry', 'Daunorubicin/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/metabolism', 'Leukemia L1210/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*pathology', 'Methacrylates/*administration & dosage', 'Mice', 'Pharmaceutical Vehicles', 'Puromycin/metabolism/*pharmacology']",1987/02/01 00:00,1987/02/01 00:01,['1987/02/01 00:00'],"['1987/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1987 Feb;55(2):165-74. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1987.33.,,['10.1038/bjc.1987.33 [doi]'],,PMC2002078,,,,

Modules were given after four and roughly 19 weeks on treatment. Each included two doses of daunorubicin (45 mg/m2/day), cytosine arabinoside (100 mg/m2 twice daily X 5), etoposide (100 mg/m2/day X 5), and 6-thioguanine (80 mg/m2/day X 5).

Twenty patients with recurrent disease were also included. The first 32 patients were given cytosine as a 24 hour infusion, but combined with the other agents this was associated with severe intestinal toxicity, which necessitated a change to a less toxic 12 hourly bolus regimen. The complications of the module are reviewed in terms of myelosuppression, enterotoxicity, infection, and other clinical problems encountered. All patients became profoundly neutropenic and thrombocytopenic. The latter was significantly more severe after cytosine infusion.

The histological features were evaluated by morphometry of iliac crest biopsies. Among the variables correlated with prognosis, we eliminated those without primary importance by mutual univariate retrospective stratification. Thus a clinical and a histological set of important prognostic criteria was established. Their influence on prognosis proved to be independent of each other and therefore could be used for separate classifications. Clinical classification yielded two groups with different prognosis: compared to the rest of the patients, the prognosis was much worse for those with a spleen size greater than 10 cm, a liver size greater than 2 cm (below costal margin) and greater than 5% circulating blasts plus promyelocytes. The histomorphological classification consisted of three subgroups: a better than average prognosis was found for patients with pseudo-Gaucher cells in the bone marrow, while in the remaining cases the prognosis was worse in patients with a high number of megakaryocytes (greater than 70/mm2) and a low volume ratio of granulopoiesis: megakaryocytes (less than 15). Since liver size was correlated with the duration of prediagnostic symptoms, the clinical classification probably reflects different disease stages, i.e. a later CML diagnosis. However, the histological set of prognostic factors is independent of the length of the prediagnostic period. Consequently, this morphological classification seems to discriminate different subgroups. Another important prognostic factor, marrow fibrosis, was independent of other histomorphological features, and correlated with duration of symptoms. It obviously also indicates more advanced disease.","['Thiele, J', 'Fohlmeister, I', 'Vonneguth, B', 'Zankovich, R', 'Fischer, R']","['Thiele J', 'Fohlmeister I', 'Vonneguth B', 'Zankovich R', 'Fischer R']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Biopsy', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/mortality/*pathology', 'Liver/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Spleen/pathology']",1986/11/01 00:00,1986/11/01 00:01,['1986/11/01 00:00'],"['1986/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Anticancer Res. 1986 Nov-Dec;6(6):1401-9.,,,,,,,,

CEM C1 (r+ly-) has a normal amount of functional glucocorticoid receptor as compared to the steroid-sensitive clonal line CEM C7. Clone ICR-27 (r-ly?), which was originally isolated following mutagenesis of CEM C7 with the mutagen ICR 191, has few glucocorticoid receptors as determined by whole-cell receptor assay. The eight randomly selected CEM C1 X ICR-27 hybrid clones all showed sensitivity to 10(-6) M dexamethasone (ly+). The receptor site content of two near-tetraploid hybrids chosen for analysis was close to that of CEM C1 (r+). Hybrids constructed between CEM C1 and the receptor-bearing, steroid-sensitive clone, CEM C7 (r+ly+) also showed glucocorticoid sensitivity, and their receptor sites corresponded to the sum of those of CEM C1 and CEM C7 (r+r+ly+). These results indicate: that CEM C1 has no trans-active inhibitor of lysis; that CEM C1 has intact glucocorticoid receptor; and that ICR-27 and CEM C1 complement one another to restore lymphocytolysis. Therefore, CEM C1 cells can serve as a donor of human glucocorticoid receptors.","['Yuh, Y S', 'Thompson, E B']","['Yuh YS', 'Thompson EB']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Somat Cell Mol Genet,Somatic cell and molecular genetics,8403568,"['0 (Receptors, Glucocorticoid)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Genetic Complementation Test', 'Humans', 'Hybrid Cells', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*genetics/pathology/physiopathology', 'Lymphocytes/drug effects/*pathology', 'Mutation', 'Phenotype', 'Receptors, Glucocorticoid/*genetics/physiology']",1987/01/01 00:00,1987/01/01 00:01,['1987/01/01 00:00'],"['1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Somat Cell Mol Genet. 1987 Jan;13(1):33-45. doi: 10.1007/BF02422297.,,['10.1007/BF02422297 [doi]'],,,,,,
