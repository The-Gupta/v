Recently, several groups have reported that CAPE is cytotoxic to tumor cells but not to normal cells. In this study, we investigated the mechanism of CAPE-induced apoptosis in human myeloid leukemia U937 cells. Treatment of U937 cells with CAPE decreased cell viability in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner. DNA fragmentation assay revealed the typical ladder profile of oligonucleosomal fragments in CAPE-treated U937 cells. In addition, as evidenced by the nuclear DAPI staining experiment, we observed that the nuclear condensation, a typical phenotype of apoptosis, was found in U937 cells treated with 5 microg/ml of CAPE. Therefore, it was suggested that CAPE is a potent agent inducing apoptosis in U937 cells. Apoptotic action of the CAPE was accompanied by release of cytochrome C, reduction of Bcl-2 expression, increase of Bax expression, activation/cleavage of caspase-3 and activation/cleavage of PARP in U937 cells, but not by Fas protein, an initial mediator in the death signaling, or by phospho-eIF2 alpha and CHOP, crucial mediators in ER-mediated apoptosis. From the results, it was concluded that CAPE induces the mitochondria-mediated apoptosis but not death receptors- or ER-mediated apoptosis in U937 cells.","['Jin, Un-Ho', 'Song, Kwon-Ho', 'Motomura, Muneo', 'Suzuki, Ikukatsu', 'Gu, Yeun-Hwa', 'Kang, Yun-Jeong', 'Moon, Tae-Chul', 'Kim, Cheorl-Ho']","['Jin UH', 'Song KH', 'Motomura M', 'Suzuki I', 'Gu YH', 'Kang YJ', 'Moon TC', 'Kim CH']","['Department of Biological Sciences, Molecular and Cellular Glycobiology Unit, Sungkyunkwan University, 300 Chunchun-Dong, Jangan-Gu, Suwon City, Kyunggi-Do 440-746, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071130,Netherlands,Mol Cell Biochem,Molecular and cellular biochemistry,0364456,"['0 (Caffeic Acids)', '0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-2)', '0 (FAS protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Receptors, Death Domain)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '147336-12-7 (Transcription Factor CHOP)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'G960R9S5SK (caffeic acid phenethyl ester)', 'ML9LGA7468 (Phenylethyl Alcohol)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caffeic Acids/*pharmacology', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromatin/metabolism', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum/drug effects/pathology', 'Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-2/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects/enzymology/*metabolism', 'Phenylethyl Alcohol/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Receptors, Death Domain/metabolism', 'Transcription Factor CHOP/metabolism', 'U937 Cells', 'fas Receptor/metabolism']",2007/12/07 09:00,2008/06/21 09:00,['2007/12/07 09:00'],"['2007/08/22 00:00 [received]', '2007/11/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/12/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/21 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/07 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s11010-007-9663-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biochem. 2008 Mar;310(1-2):43-8. doi: 10.1007/s11010-007-9663-7.

Our model is based on replacing the recent agent-based model of Roeder et al. (Nat. Med. 12(10):1181-1184, 2006) by a system of deterministic difference equations. These difference equations describe the time-evolution of clusters of individual agents that are grouped by discretizing the state space. Hence, unlike standard agent-base models, the complexity of our model is independent of the number of agents, which allows to conduct simulation studies with a realistic number of cells. This approach also allows to directly evaluate the expected steady states of the system. The results of our numerical simulations show that our model replicates the averaged behavior of the original Roeder model with a significantly reduced computational cost. Our general approach can be used to simplify other similar agent-based models. In particular, due to the reduced computational complexity of our technique, one can use it to conduct sensitivity studies of the parameters in large agent-based systems.","['Kim, Peter S', 'Lee, Peter P', 'Levy, Doron']","['Kim PS', 'Lee PP', 'Levy D']","['Department of Mathematics, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305-2125, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20071201,United States,Bull Math Biol,Bulletin of mathematical biology,0401404,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Computer Simulation', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/genetics', '*Models, Biological', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use']",2007/12/07 09:00,2008/06/25 09:00,['2007/12/07 09:00'],"['2007/04/05 00:00 [received]', '2007/09/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/12/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/25 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/07 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s11538-007-9276-z [doi]'],ppublish,Bull Math Biol. 2008 Apr;70(3):728-44. doi: 10.1007/s11538-007-9276-z.

We previously demonstrated that upregulation of the immunosuppressive molecule CD200 on chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells inhibits Th1 cytokine production required for an effective cytotoxic T cell response. CD200 expression on human tumor cells in animal models prevents human lymphocytes from rejecting the tumor; treatment with an antagonistic anti-CD200 antibody restored lymphocyte-mediated tumor growth inhibition. The current study evaluated CD200 expression on solid cancers, and its effect on immune response in vitro. METHODS AND RESULTS: CD200 protein was expressed on the surface of 5/8 ovarian cancer, 2/4 melanoma, 2/2 neuroblastoma and 2/3 renal carcinoma cell lines tested, but CD200 was absent on prostate, lung, breast, astrocytoma, or glioblastoma cell lines. Evaluation of patient samples by immunohistochemistry showed strong, membrane-associated CD200 staining on malignant cells of melanoma (4/4), ovarian cancer (3/3) and clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) (2/3), but also on normal ovary and kidney. CD200 expression on melanoma metastases was determined by RT-QPCR, and was found to be significantly higher in jejunum metastases (2/2) and lung metastases (2/6) than in normal samples. Addition of CD200-expressing, but not CD200-negative solid tumor cell lines to mixed lymphocyte reactions downregulated the production of Th1 cytokines. Inclusion of antagonistic anti-CD200 antibody restored Th1 cytokine responses. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that melanoma, ccRCC and ovarian tumor cells can express CD200, thereby potentially suppressing anti-tumor immune responses. CD200 blockade with an antagonistic antibody may permit an effective anti-tumor immune response in these solid tumor types.","['Siva, A', 'Xin, H', 'Qin, F', 'Oltean, D', 'Bowdish, K S', 'Kretz-Rommel, A']","['Siva A', 'Xin H', 'Qin F', 'Oltean D', 'Bowdish KS', 'Kretz-Rommel A']","['Alexion Antibody Technologies, Inc., 3985 Sorrento Valley Blvd, Ste A, San Diego, CA 92121, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', 'UQ4V77A8VA (antigens, CD200)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/*biosynthesis/immunology', 'Carcinoma, Renal Cell/immunology/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Kidney Neoplasms/immunology/*metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Culture Test, Mixed', 'Melanoma/immunology/*metabolism', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/immunology/*metabolism']",2007/12/07 09:00,2008/09/03 09:00,['2007/12/07 09:00'],"['2007/08/29 00:00 [received]', '2007/11/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/12/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/03 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/07 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00262-007-0429-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 2008 Jul;57(7):987-96. doi: 10.1007/s00262-007-0429-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Modulating side effects is difficult because kinases are evolutionarily and hence structurally related. The lack of specificity of the anticancer drug imatinib enables it to be used to treat chronic myeloid leukemia, where its target is the Bcr-Abl kinase, as well as a proportion of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs), where its target is the C-Kit kinase. However, imatinib also has cardiotoxic effects traceable to its impact on the C-Abl kinase. Motivated by this finding, we made a modification to imatinib that hampers Bcr-Abl inhibition; refocuses the impact on the C-Kit kinase; and promotes inhibition of an additional target, JNK, a change that is required to reinforce prevention of cardiotoxicity. We established the molecular blueprint for target discrimination in vitro using spectrophotometric and colorimetric assays and through a phage-displayed kinase screening library. We demonstrated controlled inhibitory impact on C-Kit kinase in human cell lines and established the therapeutic impact of the engineered compound in a novel GIST mouse model, revealing a marked reduction of cardiotoxicity. These findings identify the reengineered imatinib as an agent to treat GISTs with curbed side effects and reveal a bottom-up approach to control drug specificity.","['Fernandez, Ariel', 'Sanguino, Angela', 'Peng, Zhenghong', 'Ozturk, Eylem', 'Chen, Jianping', 'Crespo, Alejandro', 'Wulf, Sarah', 'Shavrin, Aleksander', 'Qin, Chaoping', 'Ma, Jianpeng', 'Trent, Jonathan', 'Lin, Yvonne', 'Han, Hee-Dong', 'Mangala, Lingegowda S', 'Bankson, James A', 'Gelovani, Juri', 'Samarel, Allen', 'Bornmann, William', 'Sood, Anil K', 'Lopez-Berestein, Gabriel']","['Fernandez A', 'Sanguino A', 'Peng Z', 'Ozturk E', 'Chen J', 'Crespo A', 'Wulf S', 'Shavrin A', 'Qin C', 'Ma J', 'Trent J', 'Lin Y', 'Han HD', 'Mangala LS', 'Bankson JA', 'Gelovani J', 'Samarel A', 'Bornmann W', 'Sood AK', 'Lopez-Berestein G']","['Department of Bioengineering and Applied Physics Division, Rice Quantum Institute, Rice University, Houston, Texas 77005, USA. arifer@rice.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Cardiotoxins)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 4)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Benzamides', 'Cardiotoxins/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl', 'Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors/*drug therapy/*enzymology', 'Heart Diseases/chemically induced/enzymology', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'K562 Cells', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 4/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/drug therapy/enzymology', 'Piperazines/adverse effects/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/adverse effects/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/adverse effects/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley']",2007/12/07 09:00,2008/02/13 09:00,['2007/12/07 09:00'],"['2007/04/11 00:00 [received]', '2007/09/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/12/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/13 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/07 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1172/JCI32373 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Invest. 2007 Dec;117(12):4044-54. doi: 10.1172/JCI32373.,,"['P50 CA083639/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM072614/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'P50CA83639/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['J Clin Invest. 2007 Dec;117(12):3650-3.

CIAPIN1 was found to be overexpressed at the mRNA and protein levels in the vincristine-induced multidrug-resistant leukemia cell line HL-60/VCR, compared with HL-60, its parental cell line. In this study, we transfected HL-60 with a eukaryotic expression vector of CIAPIN1. In vitro drug sensitivity assays suggested that HL-60-CIAPIN1 cells conferred resistance to both P-glycoprotein (P-gp)-related and -unrelated drugs. Blocking CIAPIN1 expression in HL-60/VCR cells by CIAPIN1-specific small interfering RNA increased the cells' sensitivity to various chemotherapeutic drugs. Flow cytometry results suggested that CIAPIN1 expression could suppress adriamycin-induced apoptosis, accompanied by a decreased accumulation and increased release of adriamycin. Semiquantitative RT-PCR, Western blot analysis, and luciferase reporter assays suggested that CIAPIN1 could significantly upregulate the expression of MDR-1 and Bcl-2, the transcription of the MDR-1 gene, as well as downregulate the expression of Bax. Additionally, the inhibition of CIAPIN1 expression by RNA interference or P-gp inhibitor could partially reverse CIAPIN1-mediated MDR. Taken together, our findings suggest that downregulating CIAPIN1 could sensitize leukemia cells to chemotherapeutic drugs by downregulating MDR-1 and Bcl-2 and by upregulating Bax, yet not altering either glutathione-S-transferase activity or intracellular glutathione content in leukemia cells. Further study of CIAPIN1's function may reveal more of the mechanisms of leukemia MDR and result in the development of strategies to treat leukemia.","['Li, Xiaohua', 'Hong, Liu', 'Zhao, Yunping', 'Jin, Haifeng', 'Fan, Rui', 'Du, Rui', 'Xia, Lin', 'Luo, Guanhong', 'Fan, Daiming']","['Li X', 'Hong L', 'Zhao Y', 'Jin H', 'Fan R', 'Du R', 'Xia L', 'Luo G', 'Fan D']","[""State Key Laboratory of Cancer Biology & Institute of Digestive Diseases, Xijing Hospital, the Fourth Military Medical University, 17 Changle Western Road, Xi'an 710032, China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Canada,Biochem Cell Biol,Biochemistry and cell biology = Biochimie et biologie cellulaire,8606068,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (CIAPIN1 protein, human)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple/drug effects', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Glutathione/metabolism', 'Glutathione Transferase/metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Intracellular Space/drug effects/enzymology', 'Leukemia/enzymology/genetics/*metabolism', 'Luciferases/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Transfection', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects', 'Verapamil/pharmacology', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/*metabolism']",2007/12/07 09:00,2008/03/08 09:00,['2007/12/07 09:00'],"['2007/12/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/08 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['o07-141 [pii]', '10.1139/o07-141 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Cell Biol. 2007 Dec;85(6):741-50. doi: 10.1139/o07-141.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To examine this, we analyzed whether HLA-G5 affects the proliferation of UT7/EPO and HEL erythroleukemia cells and characterized the mechanism by which HLA-G5 influences erythropoietin receptor (EPOR) signaling. We show that HLA-G5 inhibits the proliferation of UT7/EPO cells, the EPOR signaling of which is similar to that of normal erythroid progenitors. HLA-G5-mediated inhibition was associated with reduced phosphorylation of JAK2 kinase and that of the downstream signaling proteins STAT-5 and STAT-3. Involvement of JAK2 in erythroid cell proliferation has been highlighted by the role of JAK2 V617F mutation in polycythemia vera (PV), a myeloproliferative disorder characterized by erythroid lineage overproduction. We demonstrate that HLA-G5 downregulates EPOR constitutive signaling of JAK2 V617F-expressing HEL cells, leading to inhibition of cell proliferation through G1 cell cycle arrest. Combination of HLA-G5 with JAK inhibitor I further decreases HEL cell growth. Clinical relevance is provided by analysis of PV patients who carry JAK2 V617F mutation, showing that HLA-G5 inhibits the formation of erythropoietin-independent erythroid colonies.

We investigated whether defects in this pathway can be found in MDS. Elevated levels of 8-oxoguanine (8-OG) were found in a significant proportion of MDS patients, indicating increased oxidative DNA damage or defective handling of oxidative load. In a distinct subgroup of patients, increased 8-OG content was associated with increased hOGG1 mRNA expression and activity. In some patients, increased numbers of abasic sites (AP sites) correlated with low levels of POLbeta. To further investigate the nature of this defect, we examined genetic lesions potentially explaining accumulation of 8-OG and AP sites. We genotyped a large cohort of MDS patients and found a correlation between increased oxidative damage and the presence of the hOGG1-Cys326 allele suggesting inadequate compensatory feedback. Overall, this hOGG1 variant was more frequent in MDS, particularly in advanced forms, as compared to controls. In summary, we demonstrated that BER dysfunction in some MDS patients may be responsible for the increased 8-OG incorporation and explains one aspect of the propensity to chromosomal breaks in MDS but other mechanisms may also be involved.","['Jankowska, A M', 'Gondek, L P', 'Szpurka, H', 'Nearman, Z P', 'Tiu, R V', 'Maciejewski, J P']","['Jankowska AM', 'Gondek LP', 'Szpurka H', 'Nearman ZP', 'Tiu RV', 'Maciejewski JP']","['Experimental Hematology and Hematopoiesis Section, Taussig Cancer Center, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH 44195, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071206,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['5614-64-2 (8-hydroxyguanine)', '5Z93L87A1R (Guanine)', 'EC 2.7.7.7 (DNA Polymerase beta)', 'EC 3.2.2.- (DNA Glycosylases)', 'EC 3.2.2.- (oxoguanine glycosylase 1, human)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Alleles', 'Bone Marrow Cells/enzymology/pathology', 'Cell Line/metabolism', 'Chromosome Breakage', 'Cohort Studies', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Glycosylases/analysis/genetics', 'DNA Polymerase beta/analysis', '*DNA Repair', 'Enzyme Induction', 'Female', 'Guanine/analogs & derivatives/blood', 'Humans', 'Leukocytes/enzymology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Point Mutation']",2007/12/07 09:00,2008/03/28 09:00,['2007/12/07 09:00'],"['2007/12/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/28 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['2405055 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2405055 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2008 Mar;22(3):551-8. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2405055.

Our studies have shown that p210(BCR-ABL) is arranged in discrete foci in the cytoplasm of cell lines and primary CD34(+) cells but not mononuclear cells suggesting the foci may be a feature of immature chronic myeloid leukaemia cells. We have devised a strategy to score the foci and found the mean number of foci varies between the cell types. The number of foci per cell is directly related to the level of p210(BCR-ABL) expression. CLSM was also used to analyse the distribution and colocalization of CT10 regulator-like (CRKL) p210(BCR-ABL). CRKL-p210(BCR-ABL) foci were completely or partially associated, touching or separate in different regions of the same cell. We also analysed the distribution of phosphorylated CRKL (pCRKL) with p210(BCR-ABL) and unexpectedly found only a small proportion of pCRKL in complex with p210(BCR-ABL). The foci distribution and high levels of uncomplexed p210(BCR-ABL), pCRKL and CRKL protein suggested the possibility of a dynamic equilibrium. Imatinib promoted nuclear transport of p210(BCR-ABL)-positive foci. It also disrupted complex formation between p210(BCR-ABL) and casitas B-cell lymphoma and CRKL but not between p210(BCR-ABL) and GRB2.

We show here that p210(bcr-abl) responsible for chronic myelogenous leukemia induces an amoeboid type of motility while p190(bcr-abl), associated with acute lymphoid leukemia, induces a rolling type of motility. We previously reported that p210(bcr-abl) activates RhoA and Rac1, while p190(bcr-abl) although devoid of a Dbl-homology (DH) domain activates Rac1, but not RhoA. We investigated the regulation of GDP/GTP exchange factor (GEF) activities in the Bcr-Abl complex. For that purpose, different GEF activity mutants of Vav and of Bcr-Abl were constructed and stably transfected in Ba/F3 cells. Using these mutants, we demonstrate that RhoA is exclusively activated by the DH domain of p210(bcr-abl), while Rac1 activation is mostly due to Vav. Inhibition of Rac1 by Vav GEF mutant leads to immobilization of cells. Vav depletion using shRNA also induces immobilization of cells and suppression of GTP-bound Rac1. RhoA inactivation induces the specific loss of amoeboid movements. These results suggest that Rac1 activation by Vav triggers the motility of Bcr-Abl-expressing Ba/F3 cells, while the specific amoeboid mode of motility induced by p210(bcr-abl) is a consequence of RhoA activation.","['Daubon, T', 'Chasseriau, J', 'El Ali, A', 'Rivet, J', 'Kitzis, A', 'Constantin, B', 'Bourmeyster, N']","['Daubon T', 'Chasseriau J', 'El Ali A', 'Rivet J', 'Kitzis A', 'Constantin B', 'Bourmeyster N']","['IPBC, CNRS UMR 6187, Universite de Poitiers, Poitiers, France.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071203,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Arhgap35 protein, mouse)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (GTPase-Activating Proteins)', '0 (Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-vav)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rac1 GTP-Binding Protein)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Migration Inhibition/genetics', '*Cell Movement/genetics/physiology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*physiology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'GTPase-Activating Proteins/*physiology', 'Genes, abl', 'Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-vav/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/physiology', 'RNA Interference', 'Repressor Proteins/*physiology', 'rac1 GTP-Binding Protein/metabolism/physiology']",2007/12/07 09:00,2008/05/20 09:00,['2007/12/07 09:00'],"['2007/12/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/20 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['1210933 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.onc.1210933 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2008 Apr 24;27(19):2673-85. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1210933.

We previously examined c-Maf expression in various T-cell lymphomas by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and found extremely elevated c-Maf levels in angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AILT). In this study, we examined T-cell lymphomas for c-Maf and cyclin expression immunohistochemically. Of 93 cases of T-cell lymphomas we investigated in the current study, c-Maf expression was seen in 23 out of 31 cases of AILT, 3 out of 11 of adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma, 4 out of 19 of peripheral T-cell lymphoma, unspecified [PTCL(U)], and 0 out of 11 cases of mycosis fungoides, 0 out of 11 of anaplastic large cell lymphoma, and 1 out of 10 of extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type. Double immunostaining in AILT revealed that the majority of c-Maf-positive cells were also positive for CD43 (MT1), CD45RO (UCHL-1), and CD4 but were negative for CD20 (L26). Additionally, cyclins D1 and D2, which stimulate cell cycle progression, were overexpressed in a large number of the c-Maf-positive AILT samples. Quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis also showed that c-Maf was overexpressed in 8/31 cases of AILT, 0/19 cases of PTCL(U), 0/11 cases of anaplastic large cell lymphoma, 0/10 cases of extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type, and 2/8 cases of multiple myeloma, presenting significant difference between AILT and PTCL(U) (P=0.016, chi test). These findings strongly suggest that CD4-positive neoplastic T cells in AILT show c-Maf expression and provide new insight into the pathogenesis of AILT suggesting c-Maf to be a useful diagnostic marker for AILT.","['Murakami, Yoshiko Idate', 'Yatabe, Yasushi', 'Sakaguchi, Teruhiro', 'Sasaki, Eiichi', 'Yamashita, Yoriko', 'Morito, Naoki', 'Yoh, Keigyou', 'Fujioka, Yuuki', 'Matsuno, Fumihiko', 'Hata, Hiroyuki', 'Mitsuya, Hiroaki', 'Imagawa, Shigehiko', 'Suzuki, Atsushi', 'Esumi, Hiroyasu', 'Sakai, Masaharu', 'Takahashi, Satoru', 'Mori, Naoyoshi']","['Murakami YI', 'Yatabe Y', 'Sakaguchi T', 'Sasaki E', 'Yamashita Y', 'Morito N', 'Yoh K', 'Fujioka Y', 'Matsuno F', 'Hata H', 'Mitsuya H', 'Imagawa S', 'Suzuki A', 'Esumi H', 'Sakai M', 'Takahashi S', 'Mori N']","['Department of Pathology of Biological Response, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Tsurumai-cho 65, Showa-ku, Japan. yidate@med.nagoya-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Am J Surg Pathol,The American journal of surgical pathology,7707904,"['0 (Antigens, CD20)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CCND2 protein, human)', '0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (Cyclin D)', '0 (Cyclin D2)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Leukosialin)', '0 (MAF protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-maf)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (SPN protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antigens, CD20/analysis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis/genetics', 'CD4 Antigens/analysis', 'Cyclin D', 'Cyclin D2', 'Cyclins/analysis', 'Humans', 'Immunoblastic Lymphadenopathy/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens/analysis', 'Leukosialin/analysis', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/*chemistry/genetics/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-maf/*analysis/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Up-Regulation']",2007/12/07 09:00,2007/12/21 09:00,['2007/12/07 09:00'],"['2007/12/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/21 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/PAS.0b013e318054dbcf [doi]', '00000478-200711000-00009 [pii]']",ppublish,Am J Surg Pathol. 2007 Nov;31(11):1695-702. doi: 10.1097/PAS.0b013e318054dbcf.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Verticinone was used to conduct growth and apoptosis-related experiments for two stages of oral cancer on immortalized human oral keratinocytes (IHOKs) and primary oral cancer cells (HN4). The procedures included MTT assay, three-dimensional (3-D) raft cultures, Western blotting, cell cycle analysis, nuclear staining and cytochrome c expression related to the apoptosis signaling pathway. Verticinone inhibited the proliferation of immortalized and malignant oral keratinocytes in a dose- and time-dependent manner. In 3-D organotypic culture, verticinone-treated cells were less mature than the control cells, displaying low surface keratinization and decreased epithelial thickness. The major mechanism by which verticinone inhibits growth appears to be induced apoptosis and G(0)G(1) cell cycle arrest. This finding is supported by the results of the cell cycle analysis, FITC-Annexin V staining, DNA fragmentation assay and Hoechst 33258 staining. Furthermore, the cytosolic level of cytochrome c was increased, while the expression of Bcl-2 protein was gradually down-regulated and Bax was up-regulated, accompanied by caspase-3 activation. The data suggests that verticinone may induce apoptosis through a caspase pathway mediated by mitochondrial damage in immortalized keratinocytes and oral cancer cells.","['Yun, Young-Gab', 'Jeon, Byung-Hun', 'Lee, Jong-Hyun', 'Lee, Sun-Kyung', 'Lee, Hwa-Jeong', 'Jung, Kyung-Hee', 'Jun, Chang-Duk', 'Lee, Suk-Keun', 'Kim, Eun-Cheol']","['Yun YG', 'Jeon BH', 'Lee JH', 'Lee SK', 'Lee HJ', 'Jung KH', 'Jun CD', 'Lee SK', 'Kim EC']","['Department of Prescription, College of Oriental Medicine, Wonkwang University, Iksan, South Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Phytother Res,Phytotherapy research : PTR,8904486,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cevanes)', '0 (Drugs, Chinese Herbal)', '34QDF8UFSY (verticine)']",IM,"['Antibodies/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/analysis/biosynthesis', 'Carcinoma/pathology', 'Cell Cycle/*drug effects', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/analysis/biosynthesis', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cevanes/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drugs, Chinese Herbal/pharmacology', 'Fritillaria/chemistry', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Keratinocytes/*drug effects', 'Mouth Neoplasms/pathology', 'Time Factors']",2007/12/07 09:00,2008/12/17 09:00,['2007/12/07 09:00'],"['2007/12/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/07 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ptr.2345 [doi]'],ppublish,Phytother Res. 2008 Mar;22(3):416-23. doi: 10.1002/ptr.2345.,,,,,,,,,['Jun-Lee'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

By contrast, it may be possible to recover information from the so-called informative censoring by modelling both the longitudinal information and the survival process. The objective of this work is to jointly model longitudinal and survival data to assess surrogacy. Two competitive modelling strategies were used, either a multistate model summarizing the course of longitudinal data and occurrence of disease progression or death, or a joint longitudinal-survival model. We present both analyses based on a case study from two randomized clinical trials that enrolled patients with stage A chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) in order to obtain further insights into these different approaches.","['Deslandes, Emmanuelle', 'Chevret, Sylvie']","['Deslandes E', 'Chevret S']","['Departement de Biostatistique et Informatique Medicale, Hopital Saint-Louis, AP-HP, Paris, France. emmanuelle.deslandes@univ-paris-diderot.fr']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Stat Med,Statistics in medicine,8215016,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '18D0SL7309 (Chlorambucil)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers/*analysis', 'Biometry/methods', 'Cell Count/statistics & numerical data', 'Chlorambucil/therapeutic use', 'Data Interpretation, Statistical', 'Disease Progression', 'Endpoint Determination/*methods/statistics & numerical data', 'France', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Leukocytes/cytology/drug effects', 'Likelihood Functions', 'Linear Models', 'Longitudinal Studies', '*Multivariate Analysis', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', '*Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",2007/12/07 09:00,2008/04/05 09:00,['2007/12/07 09:00'],"['2007/12/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/05 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/07 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/sim.3142 [doi]'],ppublish,Stat Med. 2007 Dec 30;26(30):5411-21. doi: 10.1002/sim.3142.,,,,,,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The prognostic significance of absolute lymphocyte counts (ALC) was evaluated in young patients with acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). METHODS: In all, 171 consecutive de novo cases of AML and ALL, age <or=21 years, were analyzed. Age, initial white blood cell count, cytogenetics, and bone marrow response were compared with lymphocyte, neutrophil, and platelet counts at weekly intervals during induction chemotherapy. RESULTS: ALC is a significant independent predictor of relapse and survival. For example, in patients with AML an ALC on Day 28 of induction (ALC-28) <350 cells/microL predicts very poor survival, with a 5-year relapse-free survival (RFS) of only 10% (hazard ratio [HR] 3.7, P= .003). In contrast, an ALC-15 >350 cells/microL carries an excellent prognosis, with a 5-year overall survival (OS) of 85% (HR 0.2, P= .012). Similarly in ALL, an ALC-15 <350 cells/microL predicts poor survival, with a 6-year RFS of 43% (HR 4.5, P= .002), whereas an ALC-15 >350 cells/microL predicts excellent outcome, with a 6-year OS of 87% (HR 0.2, P= .018). Importantly, ALC remains a strong predictor in multivariate analysis with known prognostic factors. CONCLUSIONS: ALC is a simple, statistically powerful measurement for patients with de novo AML and ALL. The results, when combined with previous studies, demonstrate that ALC is a powerful new prognostic factor for a range of malignancies. These findings suggest a need for further exploration of postchemotherapy immune status and immune-modulating cancer therapies.","['De Angulo, Guillermo', 'Yuen, Carrie', 'Palla, Shana L', 'Anderson, Peter M', 'Zweidler-McKay, Patrick A']","['De Angulo G', 'Yuen C', 'Palla SL', 'Anderson PM', 'Zweidler-McKay PA']","['Division of Pediatrics, The University of Texas M.

Recently, it has been shown that mimosine also induces apoptosis, as mainly reflected in its ability to elicit characteristic nuclear changes. The present study elucidates the mechanism underlying mimosine's apoptotic effects, using the U-937 leukemia cell line. We now demonstrate that in isolated rat liver mitochondria, mimosine induces mitochondrial swelling that can be inhibited by cyclosporine A, indicative of permeability transition (PT) mega-channel opening. Mimosine-induced apoptosis was accompanied by formation of hydrogen peroxide and a decrease in reduced glutathione levels. The apoptotic process was partially inhibited by cyclosporine A and substantially blocked by the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine, suggesting an essential role for reactive oxygen species formation during the apoptotic processes. The apoptosis induced by mimosine was also accompanied by a decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential, cytochrome c release and caspase 3 and 9 activation. Our results thus imply that mimosine activates apoptosis through mitochondrial activation and formation of H2O2, both of which play functional roles in the induction of cell death.","['Hallak, Maher', 'Vazana, Liat', 'Shpilberg, Ofer', 'Levy, Itai', 'Mazar, Julia', 'Nathan, Ilana']","['Hallak M', 'Vazana L', 'Shpilberg O', 'Levy I', 'Mazar J', 'Nathan I']","['Institute of Hematology, Soroka University Medical Center, Beer Sheva, Israel.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Netherlands,Apoptosis,Apoptosis : an international journal on programmed cell death,9712129,"['0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '500-44-7 (Mimosine)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'WYQ7N0BPYC (Acetylcysteine)']",IM,"['Acetylcysteine/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclosporine/metabolism', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/metabolism', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Mimosine/*pharmacology', 'Mitochondria, Liver/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Mitochondrial Swelling/drug effects', 'Oxidative Stress/*drug effects', 'Rats', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism']",2007/12/07 09:00,2008/06/03 09:00,['2007/12/07 09:00'],"['2007/12/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/03 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/07 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s10495-007-0156-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Apoptosis. 2008 Jan;13(1):147-55. doi: 10.1007/s10495-007-0156-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This intention implies a certain antileukemic activity and myelotoxicity. Thus, a prolonged myelosuppressive maintenance is best exemplified by the optimized protocol of the CALGB published by Kanti R. Rai in 1981 (Blood 58:1203-1212, 1981) and derived by the AMLCG as a therapeutic standard. From our today's knowledge about the impact of various strategies, a lack of postremission therapy is not compatible with durable remissions. Even after an induction-type consolidation, the classic CALGB-type maintenance, or a comparably intensive regimen improved the relapse-free survival over that from alternatives. Some studies which failed to show a benefit used maintenance at low-dosage or short duration. Data about maintenance delivery in patients reaching long-term remissions demonstrate feasibility and compliance, and a low maintenance-related death rate can compete with that from alternative options. Revisiting maintenance, however, requires a comparison with other strategies on the basis of intention-to-treat. Either single prospective trials or crosstrial networking by a common standard arm and general upfront randomization can further assess the relative value of maintenance for AML.","['Buchner, Thomas', 'Krug, Utz', 'Berdel, Wolfgang E', 'Heinecke, Achim', 'Sauerland, Maria Cristina', 'Wormann, Bernhard', 'Hiddemann, Wolfgang']","['Buchner T', 'Krug U', 'Berdel WE', 'Heinecke A', 'Sauerland MC', 'Wormann B', 'Hiddemann W']","['Department of Medicine, Hematology and Oncology, University of Munster, Albert-Schweitzer-Str. 33, Munster, 48129, Germany. buechnr@uni-muenster.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Curr Treat Options Oncol,Current treatment options in oncology,100900946,,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy']",2007/12/07 09:00,2008/03/21 09:00,['2007/12/07 09:00'],"['2007/12/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/21 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/07 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s11864-007-0041-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Treat Options Oncol. 2007 Aug;8(4):296-304. doi: 10.1007/s11864-007-0041-1.,,,,,,,,22,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This unique mechanism of retrovirus resistance is governed by a single recessive gene, virus infectivity controller 1 (vic1), mapped to chromosome 17. In addition to controlling the antivirus humoral immune response, vic1 is also required for an antiviral cytotoxic response. Both types of responses were maintained in mice of the susceptible genetic background but congenic for the I/LnJ vic1 locus. Although the vic1-mediated resistance to MuLV resembles the mechanism of retroviral recovery controlled by the resistance to Friend virus 3 (rfv3) gene, the rfv3 gene has been mapped to chromosome 15 and confers resistance to MuLV but not to MMTV. Thus, we have identified a unique virus resistance mechanism that controls immunity against two distinct retroviruses.","['Case, Laure K', 'Petell, Lydia', 'Yurkovetskiy, Leonid', 'Purdy, Alexandra', 'Savage, Katherine J', 'Golovkina, Tatyana V']","['Case LK', 'Petell L', 'Yurkovetskiy L', 'Purdy A', 'Savage KJ', 'Golovkina TV']","['Department of Microbiology, University of Chicago, Room 711A, 920 E. 58th Street, Chicago, IL 60637, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071205,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '187348-17-0 (Interleukin-12)', '9008-11-1 (Interferons)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/blood', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Female', 'Immunity, Innate/*genetics', 'Interferons/immunology', 'Interleukin-12/immunology', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*immunology', 'Male', 'Mammary Tumor Virus, Mouse/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains/*virology', 'Neutralization Tests', 'Retroviridae Infections/*genetics/*immunology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*genetics/*immunology']",2007/12/07 09:00,2008/02/06 09:00,['2007/12/07 09:00'],"['2007/12/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['JVI.01991-07 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.01991-07 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2008 Feb;82(3):1438-47. doi: 10.1128/JVI.01991-07.

However, Vif leads to their degradation and counteracts their effects. Another member, A3A, restricts some retrotransposons and another virus but not HIV. We reasoned that this failure was due to the lack of appropriate targeting. Thus, we fused A3A to another viral protein, Vpr, which binds p6 in Gag and is incorporated into viral cores. Indeed, the Vpr.A3A chimera but not A3A was found abundantly in the viral core. It also restricted potently the replication of HIV and simian immunodeficiency virus in the presence and absence of Vif. Because we identified a high frequency of G to A mutations in viral cDNAs, this antiviral activity was mediated by DNA editing. Interestingly, our fusion protein did not restrict murine leukemia virus, which does not incorporate Vpr.

SUMMARY: Maintaining patients with CML in chronic phase (CP) yields the prospect of improved long-term survival. As recently as 1993, CML was limited to treatment with standard cytoreductive therapies. These therapies provide temporary disease control but do not alter progression to advanced disease with a median survival ranging 45 to 55 months from diagnosis. In the 1990s, immunologically based therapy with interferon alpha (IFNalpha) therapy was shown to be superior to cytoreductive therapies with a median survival of 60 to 90 months. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) has offered curative potential for patients with CML; however, the median age of diagnosis of 55 years, the lack of suitable donors, and the morbidity of the procedure precludes widespread applicability of this treatment. Imatinib, the first approved tyrosine kinase inhibitor, functions by blocking the ATP binding site on the BCR-ABL kinase. It was first shown to be efficacious in patients who failed IFNalpha and then tested as a front line therapy (the International Randomized Study of Interferon [IRIS] trial). The five year follow up on the IRIS trial found that the responses were durable with progression free survival estimated at 93%. Imatinib has been found to have a lower rate of hematologic response and shorter duration of response in patients with advanced disease. Currently patients in blast crisis (BC) have the option to undergo a number of induction chemotherapies, such as etoposide, cytarabine, carboplatin (VAC) with the hope of temporarily restoring the patient to CP in preparation for HSCT. Imatinib, when administered at the standard dose of 400 mg/day is relatively well tolerated with major toxicities limited to myelo-suppression, edema, GI upset, rash, and muscle pain. Many of these toxicities are managed by decreasing the dose until the toxicity resolves. Imatinib is an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 enzymes necessitating careful monitoring of concomitant medications metabolized by these enzymes. Resistance may develop to imatinib most often caused by the evolution of mutations blocking imatinib interactions with the BCR-ABL adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding site. The second generation BCR-ABL inhibitor, dasatinib, can block the activity of many of these mutations; however, the T315I mutation, at present, is resistant to all available kinase inhibitors. Experimental drugs that block this mutation are just entering phase two clinical trials. CONCLUSION: The development of therapeutic agents targeting BCR-ABL has revolutionized the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Imatinib has successfully allowed CML patients to remain in CP for at least five years in 90% of patients. Dasatinib has activity against a number of Imatinib-resistant mutants providing an additional therapeutic option for these patients.","['Fausel, Christopher']",['Fausel C'],"['Hematology/Oncology/BMT, Indiana University Cancer Center, 550 North University Boulevard, Indianapolis, IN 46202, USA. cfausel@clarian.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,England,Am J Health Syst Pharm,American journal of health-system pharmacy : AJHP : official journal of the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists,9503023,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Dasatinib', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/methods', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Interferon-alpha/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/drug therapy', 'Piperazines/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Thiazoles/pharmacology']",2007/12/11 09:00,2007/12/22 09:00,['2007/12/11 09:00'],"['2007/12/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/22 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['64/24_Supplement_15/S9 [pii]', '10.2146/ajhp070482 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Health Syst Pharm. 2007 Dec 15;64(24 Suppl 15):S9-15. doi: 10.2146/ajhp070482.,,,,,,,,18,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epidemiology, staging biology, and monitoring techniques are reviewed. SUMMARY: CML is a myeloproliferative disorder that affects all lineages of hematopoiesis. Final confirmation of CML comes with detection of the Philadelphia Chromosome (Ph) or BCR-ABL transcripts. The disease presents in one of three phases: chronic phase, accelerated phase, or blast crisis. Progression from chronic phase to accelerated phase usually involves the accumulation of additional cytogenetic aberrations and the arising of resistance to therapy. Although at one point mortality associated with CML was high, new kinase inhibitor therapies have markedly extended the life-span of these patients. These inhibitors were derived through the initial observation of the association of the Ph with CML and the eventual identification of the BCR-ABL oncogene which arises from this translocation. Analysis of the mechanism by which BCR-ABL transforms cells identified this protein as a tyrosine kinase and led to the targeting of this activity. The majority of patients present in chronic phase, which is where these kinase inhibitors have their greatest efficacy. Monitoring of disease progression is of critical importance as the prognosis drops significantly for patients with advanced disease. Blood counts, cytogenetics, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are currently used to assess disease. Blood counts are inexpensive but lack sensitivity. Cytogenetic karyotyping while requiring specialized training provides evidence of clonal evolution. Quantitative PCR is capable of tremendous sensitivity making it well suited for assessing response to therapy and the early detection of therapy failures. CONCLUSION: Our understanding of BCR-ABL has allowed the development of therapies, which may keep patients with CML in chronic phase indefinitely. This has created a situation in which patient monitoring is essential for detecting changes in the status of CML. The tests described here provide a comprehensive assessment of disease status allowing for effective patient management.","['Sessions, Jolynn']",['Sessions J'],"['Hematology/Oncology, Emory University Hospital, 1364 Clifton Road, NE, Atlanta, GA 30322, USA. jolynn_sessions@emoryhealthcare.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,England,Am J Health Syst Pharm,American journal of health-system pharmacy : AJHP : official journal of the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists,9503023,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*diagnosis/epidemiology/genetics/therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/diagnosis/genetics/therapy', 'Neoplasm Staging']",2007/12/11 09:00,2007/12/22 09:00,['2007/12/11 09:00'],"['2007/12/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/22 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['64/24_Supplement_15/S4 [pii]', '10.2146/ajhp070484 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Health Syst Pharm. 2007 Dec 15;64(24 Suppl 15):S4-9. doi: 10.2146/ajhp070484.,,,,,,,,13,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This review addresses the mechanisms underlying imatinib resistance and the strategies currently being used to overcome that resistance. SUMMARY: Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a stem cell cancer caused by BCR-ABL. Imatinib, a BCR-ABL inhibitor, has significantly decreased CML mortality by stopping disease progression in CP. This success has been tempered by the appearance of imatinib-resistant clones. These clones allow CML to progress to advanced stages of disease where the prognosis is poor. Mechanisms of imatinib resistance include plasma protein binding, drug efflux, mutation of BCR-ABL, gene amplification of BCR-ABL, and activation of BCR-ABL independent proliferative pathways. The first four of these mechanisms could potentially be addressed by increasing the imatinib dose and recent clinical trials have shown this to be the case. Pharmacokinetic analysis demonstrated that patients with low imatinib plasma concentrations fared more poorly then patients with high plasma concentrations. Doubling the standard dose of 400 mg per day increased patient responses while decreasing the time to response. Toxicity was also increased resulting in approximately 50% of patients decreasing the dose. The strategy of waiting to see who failed imatinib at 400 mg per day and then increasing the dose of that subpopulation was unsuccessful. The interpretation of these data is that it is beneficial to treat CML as aggressively as possible as early as possible. Dasatinib is the second BCR-ABL inhibitor to become available. It binds with a 350-fold greater affinity to BCR-ABL and shows efficacy against a number of imatinib-resistant mutations. Dasatinib also inhibits SRC kinase, which may play a role in both maintaining BCR-ABL activity and in BCR-ABL independent signaling pathways. Clinical trials with dasatinib have had favorable results and are comparable with high-dose imatinib. Imatinib also compares favorably with stem cell transplant (SCT). Economic analysis shows imatinib and dasatinib therapies, while quite expensive, are on par with dialysis in terms of cost of quality adjusted life years.

We investigated whether SKI-606, a potent Bcr-Abl and Src kinase inhibitor without anti-PDGF or c-Kit activity, could effectively target primitive CML progenitors. CML and normal progenitors were cultured with SKI-606 or imatinib. SKI-606 effectively inhibited Bcr-Abl kinase activity in CML CD34(+) cells and inhibited Src phosphorylation more potently than imatinib. However, SKI-606 and imatinib resulted in similar suppression of CML primitive and committed progenitor proliferation and growth in CFC and LTC-IC assays. Exposure to either agent alone or in combination resulted in only modest increase in apoptosis. Evaluation of downstream signaling pathways indicated that Akt and STAT5 activity was not changed, but a delayed increase in MAPK activity was seen at high concentrations of SKI-606. SKI-606 inhibited normal progenitor proliferation to a lesser extent than imatinib. SKI-606 effectively inhibits Bcr-Abl and Src kinase activity and inhibits CML progenitor growth with relatively little effect on normal progenitors. However, SKI-606 does not demonstrate increased ability to eliminate primitive CML progenitors by apoptosis compared with imatinib, emphasizing the need for additional strategies besides Bcr-Abl kinase inhibition for curative therapy of CML.","['Konig, Heiko', 'Holyoake, Tessa L', 'Bhatia, Ravi']","['Konig H', 'Holyoake TL', 'Bhatia R']","['Department of Hematopoietic Stem Cell and Leukemia Research, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, CA 91010, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071204,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Aniline Compounds)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Quinolines)', '5018V4AEZ0 (bosutinib)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)']",IM,"['Aniline Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Fetal Blood/cytology/drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Nitriles/*pharmacology', 'Piperazines/therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use', 'Quinolines/*pharmacology', 'src-Family Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors']",2007/12/07 09:00,2008/05/22 09:00,['2007/12/07 09:00'],"['2007/12/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/22 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)44632-4 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2007-05-092056 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2008 Feb 15;111(4):2329-38. doi: 10.1182/blood-2007-05-092056.

These abnormalities include genomic instability, oncogene activation, and growth factor independent proliferation. Therefore, cancer cells likely require a block in apoptosis in order to survive. Overexpression of the antiapoptotic protein BCL-2 provides a block in apoptosis that is frequently observed in cancer cells. We have developed methods for the detection and analysis of BCL-2 dependence and here apply them to acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). BH3 profiling, a mitochondrial assay that classifies blocks in the intrinsic apoptotic pathway, indicated a dependence on BCL-2 of both ALL cell lines and primary samples. This dependence predicted that BCL-2 would be complexed with select pro-death BH3 family proteins, a prediction confirmed by the isolation of BCL-2 complexes with BIM. Furthermore, the BH3 profiling and protein analysis predicted that ALL cell lines and primary cells would be sensitive to ABT-737 as a single agent. Finally, BH3 profiling and protein studies accurately predicted a relative degree of sensitivity to BCL-2 antagonism in cell lines. The ALL cells studied exhibit BCL-2 dependence, supporting clinical trials of BCL-2 antagonists in ALL as single agents or combination therapies.","['Del Gaizo Moore, Victoria', 'Schlis, Krysta D', 'Sallan, Stephen E', 'Armstrong, Scott A', 'Letai, Anthony']","['Del Gaizo Moore V', 'Schlis KD', 'Sallan SE', 'Armstrong SA', 'Letai A']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071204,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (ABT-737)', '0 (Annexin A5)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BCL2L11 protein, human)', '0 (BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Biphenyl Compounds)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Nitrophenols)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', 'EC 1.9.3.1 (Electron Transport Complex IV)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Annexin A5/metabolism', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/drug effects/physiology', 'BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein/drug effects/physiology', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11', 'Biphenyl Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Electron Transport Complex IV/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Membrane Proteins/drug effects/physiology', 'Mitochondria/enzymology', 'Nitrophenols/*pharmacology', 'Peptide Fragments/chemistry', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/drug effects/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology', 'Sulfonamides/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2007/12/07 09:00,2008/05/22 09:00,['2007/12/07 09:00'],"['2007/12/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/22 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)44629-4 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2007-06-098012 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2008 Feb 15;111(4):2300-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2007-06-098012.

In 1332 individuals receiving intensive AML therapy presence of MLD was negatively correlated with complete remission (P = .001) in univariate, but not in multivariate, analysis. Multivariate analysis of either event-free or overall survival again failed to show an independent prognostic significance of MLD besides age, cytogenetics, and, in part, NPM1/FLT3-ITD mutations.

In general, ALL has a better prognosis than AML. To understand the distinct mechanisms in leukemogenesis between ALL and AML and to identify markers for diagnosis and treatment, we performed a large-scale genome-wide microRNA (miRNA, miR) expression profiling assay and identified 27 miRNAs that are differentially expressed between ALL and AML. Among them, miR-128a and -128b are significantly overexpressed, whereas let-7b and miR-223 are significantly down-regulated in ALL compared with AML. They are the most discriminatory miRNAs between ALL and AML. Using the expression signatures of a minimum of two of these miRNAs resulted in an accuracy rate of >95% in the diagnosis of ALL and AML. The differential expression patterns of these four miRNAs were validated further through large-scale real-time PCR on 98 acute leukemia samples covering most of the common cytogenetic subtypes, along with 10 normal control samples. Furthermore, we found that overexpression of miR-128 in ALL was at least partly associated with promoter hypomethylation and not with an amplification of its genomic locus. Taken together, we showed that expression signatures of as few as two miRNAs could accurately discriminate ALL from AML, and that epigenetic regulation might play an important role in the regulation of expression of miRNAs in acute leukemias.","['Mi, Shuangli', 'Lu, Jun', 'Sun, Miao', 'Li, Zejuan', 'Zhang, Hao', 'Neilly, Mary Beth', 'Wang, Yungui', 'Qian, Zhijian', 'Jin, Jie', 'Zhang, Yanming', 'Bohlander, Stefan K', 'Le Beau, Michelle M', 'Larson, Richard A', 'Golub, Todd R', 'Rowley, Janet D', 'Chen, Jianjun']","['Mi S', 'Lu J', 'Sun M', 'Li Z', 'Zhang H', 'Neilly MB', 'Wang Y', 'Qian Z', 'Jin J', 'Zhang Y', 'Bohlander SK', 'Le Beau MM', 'Larson RA', 'Golub TR', 'Rowley JD', 'Chen J']","['Department of Medicine, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071204,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (MicroRNAs)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA/genetics', 'Epigenesis, Genetic/genetics', 'Gene Amplification/genetics', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*genetics', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*genetics']",2007/12/07 09:00,2008/01/12 09:00,['2007/12/07 09:00'],"['2007/12/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/12 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['0709313104 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.0709313104 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2007 Dec 11;104(50):19971-6. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0709313104.

The defects are often caused by mutations in coding regions of MMR genes or promoter methylation of the genes. However, in many cases, despite that a hypermutable phenotype is detected in a patient, no mutations/hypermethylations of MMR genes can be detected. We report here a novel mechanism that a mutation in the MLH1 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) leads to MMR deficiency. A relapsed leukemia patient displayed microsatellite instability, but no genetic and epigenetic alterations in key MMR genes were identifiable. Instead, a 3-nucleotide (TTC) deletion in the MLH1 3'-UTR was found in the patient's blood sample. The mutant MLH1 3'-UTR was found to significantly reduce the expressions of both a firefly luciferase reporter gene and an ectopic MLH1 gene in model cell lines. Consistent with these observations, a significant reduction in the steady-state level of MLH1 mRNA was observed in white blood cells of the patient. These findings suggest that the mutant MLH1 3'-UTR can cause a severely reduced/defective MMR activity conferring leukemia relapse, likely by down-regulating MLH1 expression at the mRNA level. Although the exact mechanism by which the mutant 3'-UTR down-regulates the MLH1 mRNA is not known, our findings provide a novel marker for cancers with MMR defects.","['Mao, Guogen', 'Pan, Xiaoyu', 'Gu, Liya']","['Mao G', 'Pan X', 'Gu L']","['Department of Toxicology, University of Kentucky College of Medicine, Lexington, Kentucky 40536.', 'Department of Toxicology, University of Kentucky College of Medicine, Lexington, Kentucky 40536.', 'Department of Toxicology, University of Kentucky College of Medicine, Lexington, Kentucky 40536; Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Kentucky College of Medicine, Lexington, Kentucky 40536.

We tested the hypothesis that individual CSF proteins distinguish CNS lymphoma from benign focal brain lesions. METHODS: We used a liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry-based method to differentially quantify and identify several hundred CSF proteins in CNS lymphoma and control patients. We used enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to confirm one of these markers in an additional validation set of 101 cases. RESULTS: Approximately 80 CSF proteins were identified and found to be present at significantly different concentrations, both higher and lower, in training and test studies, which were highly concordant. To further validate these observations, we defined in detail the expression of one of these candidate biomarkers, antithrombin III (ATIII). ATIII RNA transcripts were identified within CNS lymphomas, and ATIII protein was localized selectively to tumor neovasculature. Determination of ATIII concentration by ELISA was significantly more accurate (> 75% sensitivity; > 98% specificity) than cytology in the identification of cancer. Measurement of CSF ATIII levels was found to potentially enhance the ability to diagnose and predict outcome. CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate for the first time that proteomic analysis of CSF yields individual biomarkers with greater sensitivity in the identification of cancer than does CSF cytology. We propose that the discovery of CSF protein biomarkers will facilitate early and noninvasive diagnosis in patients with lesions not amenable to brain biopsy, as well as provide improved surrogates of prognosis and treatment response in CNS lymphoma and brain metastasis.","['Roy, Sushmita', 'Josephson, S Andrew', 'Fridlyand, Jane', 'Karch, Jon', 'Kadoch, Cigall', 'Karrim, Juliana', 'Damon, Lloyd', 'Treseler, Patrick', 'Kunwar, Sandeep', 'Shuman, Marc A', 'Jones, Ted', 'Becker, Christopher H', 'Schulman, Howard', 'Rubenstein, James L']","['Roy S', 'Josephson SA', 'Fridlyand J', 'Karch J', 'Kadoch C', 'Karrim J', 'Damon L', 'Treseler P', 'Kunwar S', 'Shuman MA', 'Jones T', 'Becker CH', 'Schulman H', 'Rubenstein JL']","['PPD Biomarker Discovery Sciences, LLC, Menlo Park, CA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20071203,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '9000-94-6 (Antithrombin III)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antithrombin III/genetics/metabolism', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*cerebrospinal fluid', 'Brain Neoplasms/*cerebrospinal fluid/pathology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/cerebrospinal fluid/pathology', 'Lymphoma/*cerebrospinal fluid/pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/cerebrospinal fluid/pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell, Marginal Zone/cerebrospinal fluid/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/cerebrospinal fluid/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/cerebrospinal fluid/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*cerebrospinal fluid', 'Proteomics', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Survival Rate']",2007/12/07 09:00,2008/01/30 09:00,['2007/12/07 09:00'],"['2007/12/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/30 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['JCO.2007.12.1053 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2007.12.1053 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2008 Jan 1;26(1):96-105. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2007.12.1053.

Mice transplanted with bone marrow cells transduced with the Mixl1 homeobox gene develop a very high frequency of myeloid leukemia derived from the transduced cells. Preleukemic mice contained a high frequency of transduced clonogenic granulocytic cells. They exhibited an abnormally high capacity for self-replication and could generate immortalized granulocytic cell lines that remained absolutely dependent on either GM-CSF or IL-3 and were not leukemic. Organs from mice repopulated by marrow cells transduced either with Mixl1 or the control murine stem cell virus vector exhibited a capacity to produce IL-3 in vitro, activity being highest with the lungs, marrow, bladder, and thymus. Supporting evidence for the in vivo production of IL-3 was the frequent development of mast cells in the marrow. Overexpression of Mixl1 appears capable of inducing an abnormal self-renewal capacity in granulocytic precursors. Aberrant production of IL-3 was not present in the continuous Mixl cell lines and was therefore not in itself likely to be a leukemogenic change but it could support the enhanced survival and proliferation of the Mixl1 granulocytic populations until a final leukemogenic mutation occurs in them.","['Metcalf, Donald', 'Glaser, Stefan', 'Mifsud, Sandra', 'Di Rago, Ladina', 'Robb, Lorraine']","['Metcalf D', 'Glaser S', 'Mifsud S', 'Di Rago L', 'Robb L']","['The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, 1G Royal Parade, Parkville, Victoria 3050, Australia. metcalf@wehi.edu.au']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071203,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Mixl1 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/*metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Interleukin-3/biosynthesis', 'Mast Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Preleukemia/genetics/*metabolism/*pathology']",2007/12/07 09:00,2008/01/12 09:00,['2007/12/07 09:00'],"['2007/12/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/12 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['0710339104 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.0710339104 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2007 Dec 11;104(50):20013-8. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0710339104.

However, the role of these molecules inside the immune system and the signal transduction mechanism(s) they use are largely unknown. Here, we show that Semaphorin3A (Sema3A) triggers a proapoptotic program that sensitizes leukemic T cells to Fas (CD95)-mediated apoptosis. We found that Sema3A stimulation provoked Fas translocation into lipid raft microdomains before binding with agonistic antibody or FasL (CD95L). Disruption of lipid rafts reduced sensitivity to Fas-mediated apoptosis in the presence of Sema3A. Furthermore, we show that plexin-A1, together with Sema3A-binding neuropilin-1, was rapidly incorporated into membrane rafts after ligand stimulation, resulting in the transport of actin-linking proteins into Fas-enriched rafts. Cells expressing a dominant-negative mutant of plexin-A1 did not show Fas clustering and apoptosis on Sema3A/Fas costimulation. This work identifies a novel biologic function of semaphorins and presents an unexpected signaling mechanism linking semaphorin to the tumor necrosis factor family receptors.","['Moretti, Simona', 'Procopio, Antonio', 'Lazzarini, Raffaella', 'Rippo, Maria Rita', 'Testa, Roberto', 'Marra, Maurizio', 'Tamagnone, Luca', 'Catalano, Alfonso']","['Moretti S', 'Procopio A', 'Lazzarini R', 'Rippo MR', 'Testa R', 'Marra M', 'Tamagnone L', 'Catalano A']","['Department of Molecular Pathology and Innovative Therapies, Polytechnic University of Marche, Ancona, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071203,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Semaphorin-3A)', '0 (fas Receptor)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/pathology', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Line', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/metabolism/pathology', 'Membrane Microdomains/*physiology', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Protein Transport', 'RNA Interference', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Semaphorin-3A/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'fas Receptor/metabolism/*physiology']",2007/12/07 09:00,2008/05/22 09:00,['2007/12/07 09:00'],"['2007/12/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/22 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)44628-2 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2007-06-096529 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2008 Feb 15;111(4):2290-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2007-06-096529.

Here we studied the level of protein tyrosine phosphorylations in a series of fresh AML samples and evaluated the effect of TK inhibitors. Compared with normal hematopoietic progenitors, a high level of tyrosine phosphorylation was detected in most acute myeloid leukemia (AML) samples. The Src family kinases (SFKs) appeared constitutively activated in most cases, including in the CD34(+)CD38(-)CD123(+) compartment as revealed by the level of phosphorylated tyrosine 416. Lyn was the major SFK family member expressed in an active form in AML cells where it was abnormally distributed throughout the plasma membrane and the cytosol as opposed to normal hematopoietic progenitors. The SFK inhibitor, PP2, strongly reduced the global level of tyrosine phosphorylations, inhibited cell proliferation, and induced apoptosis in patient samples without affecting normal granulomonocytic colony forming units. Moreover, silencing Lyn expression by small interfering RNA in primary AML cells strongly inhibited proliferation. Interestingly, a link between Lyn and the mTOR pathway was observed as PP2 and a Lyn knockdown both affected the phosphorylation of mTOR targets without inhibiting Akt phosphorylation. Lyn should be considered as a novel pharmacologic target for AML therapy.","['Dos Santos, Cedric', 'Demur, Cecile', 'Bardet, Valerie', 'Prade-Houdellier, Nais', 'Payrastre, Bernard', 'Recher, Christian']","['Dos Santos C', 'Demur C', 'Bardet V', 'Prade-Houdellier N', 'Payrastre B', 'Recher C']","[""Inserm U563, Centre de Physiopathologie de Toulouse Purpan, Departement d'Oncogenese, Signalisation et Innovation Therapeutique, Universite Toulouse III Paul Sabatier, IFR30, Toulouse, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071203,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Chromones)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Morpholines)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Viral)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '21820-51-9 (Phosphotyrosine)', '31M2U1DVID (2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (lyn protein-tyrosine kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)', 'W36ZG6FT64 (Sirolimus)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology/drug effects/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromones/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Morpholines/pharmacology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Viral/*physiology', 'Phosphotyrosine/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Reference Values', 'Sirolimus/pharmacology', 'U937 Cells', 'src-Family Kinases/*physiology']",2007/12/07 09:00,2008/05/22 09:00,['2007/12/07 09:00'],"['2007/12/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/22 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)44626-9 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2007-04-082099 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2008 Feb 15;111(4):2269-79. doi: 10.1182/blood-2007-04-082099.

It has been suggested that aberrant DNA methylation can affect the sensitivity of cancers to antineoplastic agents by altering expression of genes critical to drug response. To study this issue, we used bisulfite PCR to assess DNA methylation of 32 promoter-associated CpG islands in human cancer cell lines from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) drug-screening panel (NCI-60 panel). The frequency of aberrant hypermethylation of these islands ranged from 2% to 81% in NCI-60 cancer cells, and provided a database that can be analyzed for the sensitivity to approximately 30,000 drugs tested in this panel. By correlating drug activity with DNA methylation, we identified a list of methylation markers that predict sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drugs. Among them, hypermethylation of the p53 homologue p73 and associated gene silencing was strongly correlated with sensitivity to alkylating agents. We used small interfering RNA to down-regulate p73 expression in multiple cell lines, including the resistant cell lines TK10 (renal cancer) and SKMEL28 (melanoma). Down-regulating p73 substantially increased sensitivity to commonly used alkylating agents, including cisplatin, indicating that epigenetic silencing of p73 directly modulates drug sensitivity.

Accordingly, the inhibition of JAK2 or of its downstream signaling pathways suppresses the proliferation of AML cells. Because (E)-3(6-bromopyridin-2-yl)-2-cyano-N-((S0-1-phenylethyl)acrylamide) (WP1066) is a novel analogue of the JAK2 inhibitor AG490, we tested its activity in AML cells and investigated its mechanism of action. Using clonogenic assays, we found that although WP1066 had a marginal effect on normal marrow progenitors, it inhibited the proliferation of AML colony-forming cells obtained from patients with newly diagnosed AML and that of the AML cell lines OCIM2 and K562. WP1066 inhibited OCIM2 cell multiplication by inducing accumulation of cells at the G(0)-G(1) phase of the cell cycle. Similar to its parent compound AG490, WP1066 inhibited the phosphorylation of JAK2, but unlike AG490, WP1066 also degraded JAK2 protein, thereby blocking its downstream signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) and phosphoinositide-3-kinase pathways. These effects resulted in the activation of the caspase pathway. Incubation of both OCIM2 and K562 cells with WP1066 activated caspase-3, induced cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, and caused caspase-dependent apoptotic cell death. Thus, WP1066 is a potent JAK2 inhibitor whose effects in AML and other hematologic malignancies merit further investigation.","['Ferrajoli, Alessandra', 'Faderl, Stefan', 'Van, Quin', 'Koch, Patricia', 'Harris, David', 'Liu, Zhiming', 'Hazan-Halevy, Inbal', 'Wang, Yongtao', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M', 'Priebe, Waldemar', 'Estrov, Zeev']","['Ferrajoli A', 'Faderl S', 'Van Q', 'Koch P', 'Harris D', 'Liu Z', 'Hazan-Halevy I', 'Wang Y', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Priebe W', 'Estrov Z']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.

Although functional activation of IRF3 by viral infection is relatively well documented, the biological role and regulatory mechanism underlying cell growth inhibition by IRF3 are poorly understood. Here, we show a novel regulatory pathway connecting IRF3-promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML)-p53 in primary and cancer cell lines. Overexpression of IRF3 induces p53-dependent cell growth inhibition in cancer cell lines with normal p53 activity. In addition, doxycycline-induced expression of IRF3 in U87MG cells inhibits tumor growth in nude mice in vivo. IRF3 is found to increase expression of PML by a direct transcriptional activation as determined by PML-promoter-luciferase and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. When PML is depleted by RNA interference-mediated knockdown, IRF3 fails to increase p53 acetylation and its transcriptional activity. Taken together, the results of the present study indicate that direct transcriptional activation of PML by IRF3 results in the p53-dependent growth inhibition of normal and cancer cells in vitro and in vivo, which is suggestive of a novel regulatory network between the innate immune response and tumor suppression.","['Kim, Tae-Kyung', 'Lee, Joong-Seob', 'Oh, Se-Yeong', 'Jin, Xun', 'Choi, Yun-Jaie', 'Lee, Tae-Hoon', 'Lee, Eun ho', 'Choi, Young-Ki', 'You, Seungkwon', 'Chung, Yong Gu', 'Lee, Jang-Bo', 'DePinho, Ronald A', 'Chin, Lynda', 'Kim, Hyunggee']","['Kim TK', 'Lee JS', 'Oh SY', 'Jin X', 'Choi YJ', 'Lee TH', 'Lee Eh', 'Choi YK', 'You S', 'Chung YG', 'Lee JB', 'DePinho RA', 'Chin L', 'Kim H']","['The Laboratory of Cell Growth and Function Regulation, Division of Biotechnology, College of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, School of Medicine, Korea University, Anam-dong, Seongbuk-gu, Seoul 136-713, South Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Interferon Regulatory Factor-3)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)']",IM,"['Acetylation', 'Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'DNA Damage', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Fibroblasts/metabolism', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique, Indirect', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Interferon Regulatory Factor-3/*metabolism', 'Luciferases/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplasm Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/genetics/metabolism/*prevention & control', 'Nuclear Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'RNA Interference', 'Transcription Factors/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*physiology', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Zinc Fingers']",2007/12/07 09:00,2008/01/23 09:00,['2007/12/07 09:00'],"['2007/12/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/23 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['67/23/11133 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-1342 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2007 Dec 1;67(23):11133-40. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-1342.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

TRF2 is a component of a telomeric DNA/protein complex called shelterin. However, TRF2 function in ALT cells remains elusive. In telomerase-positive tumor cells, TRF2 inactivation results in telomere de-protection, activation of ATM, and consequent induction of p53-dependent apoptosis. We show that in ALT cells this sequence of events is different. First, TRF2 inactivation/silencing does not induce cell death in p53-proficient ALT cells, but rather triggers cellular senescence. Second, ATM is constitutively activated in ALT cells and colocalizes with TRF2 into APBs. However, it is only following TRF2 silencing that the ATM target p53 is activated. In this context, PML is indispensable for p53-dependent p21 induction. Finally, we find a substantial loss of telomeric DNA upon stable TRF2 knockdown in ALT cells. Overall, we provide insight into the functional consequences of shelterin alterations in ALT cells.","[""Stagno D'Alcontres, Martina"", 'Mendez-Bermudez, Aaron', 'Foxon, Jennifer L', 'Royle, Nicola J', 'Salomoni, Paolo']","[""Stagno D'Alcontres M"", 'Mendez-Bermudez A', 'Foxon JL', 'Royle NJ', 'Salomoni P']","['MRC Toxicology Unit, University of Leicester, Leicester LE1 9HN, England, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Cell Biol,The Journal of cell biology,0375356,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Telomeric Repeat Binding Protein 2)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']",IM,"['Cell Cycle', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cellular Senescence', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*metabolism', 'Down-Regulation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Silencing', 'Humans', 'Intranuclear Inclusion Bodies/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Telomere/*metabolism', 'Telomeric Repeat Binding Protein 2/*deficiency/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']",2007/12/07 09:00,2007/12/28 09:00,['2007/12/07 09:00'],"['2007/12/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/28 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['jcb.200703020 [pii]', '10.1083/jcb.200703020 [doi]']",ppublish,J Cell Biol. 2007 Dec 3;179(5):855-67. doi: 10.1083/jcb.200703020.,,"['G0500336/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'G9806740/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'MC_U132670601/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom']",,,PMC2099206,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study was designed to assess the effect of methylation status on the outcome of conventional induction chemotherapy. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Sixty patients with high-risk MDS or acute myeloid leukemia following MDS were treated with standard doses of daunorubicin and 1-beta-d-arabinofuranosylcytosine. Standard prognostic variables and methylation status of the P15(ink4b) (P15), E-cadherin (CDH), and hypermethylated in cancer 1 (HIC) genes were analyzed before treatment. RESULTS: Forty percent of the patients achieved complete remission (CR). CR rate was lower in patients with high WBC counts (P = 0.03) and high CD34 expression on bone marrow cells (P = 0.02). Whereas P15 status alone was not significantly associated with CR rate (P = 0.25), no patient with hypermethylation of all three genes achieved CR (P = 0.03). Moreover, patients with CDH methylation showed a significantly lower CR rate (P = 0.008), and CDH methylation retained its prognostic value also in the multivariate analysis. Hypermethylation was associated with increased CD34 expression, but not with other known predictive factors for response, such as cytogenetic profile. CONCLUSIONS: We show for the first time a significant effect of methylation status on the outcome of conventional chemotherapy in high-risk MDS and acute myelogenous leukemia following MDS. Provided confirmed in an independent study, our results should be used as a basis for therapeutic decision-making in this patient group.","['Grovdal, Michael', 'Khan, Rasheed', 'Aggerholm, Anni', 'Antunovic, Petar', 'Astermark, Jan', 'Bernell, Per', 'Engstrom, Lena-Maria', 'Kjeldsen, Lars', 'Linder, Olle', 'Nilsson, Lars', 'Olsson, Anna', 'Wallvik, Jonas', 'Tangen, Jon Magnus', 'Oberg, Gunnar', 'Jacobsen, Sten Eirik', 'Hokland, Peter', 'Porwit, Anna', 'Hellstrom-Lindberg, Eva']","['Grovdal M', 'Khan R', 'Aggerholm A', 'Antunovic P', 'Astermark J', 'Bernell P', 'Engstrom LM', 'Kjeldsen L', 'Linder O', 'Nilsson L', 'Olsson A', 'Wallvik J', 'Tangen JM', 'Oberg G', 'Jacobsen SE', 'Hokland P', 'Porwit A', 'Hellstrom-Lindberg E']","['Division of Haematology, Department of Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital, Huddinge, Stockholm, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Cadherins)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15)', '0 (HIC1 protein, human)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '5CSZ8459RP (Cytidine)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD34/biosynthesis', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Cells/immunology', 'Cadherins/genetics', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15/genetics', 'Cytidine/administration & dosage', '*DNA Methylation', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/*drug therapy/*genetics/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy/*genetics/immunology', 'Prospective Studies', 'Remission Induction', 'Treatment Outcome']",2007/12/07 09:00,2008/05/08 09:00,['2007/12/07 09:00'],"['2007/12/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/08 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['13/23/7107 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-07-1193 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2007 Dec 1;13(23):7107-12. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-07-1193.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Our study included 37 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and 11 patients with Morbus Hodgkin (MH) disease, who were treated with high-dose glucocorticoid therapy, and 26 control patients with other types of malignancies. APRs were assessed with a standardized measure via parent-report. Patients with ALL and MH were further analyzed for signs of neuronal cell death in the cerebrospinal fluid, polymorphisms of the glucocorticoid receptor gene, as well as cortisol, adrenocorticorticotropic hormone, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate blood levels. RESULTS: Fifty-four percent of ALL, 36% of MH, and 23% of control patients developed APR in the first few weeks of therapy. Approximately 3.5 months later, the majority of patients with ALL showed no APR, similar to control patients. Patients demonstrating a higher, nonsuppressible secretion of cortisol and/or adrenocorticorticotropic hormone during glucocorticoid therapy were found to be more likely to develop APR. No sign of neuronal cell destruction and no correlation of APR with specific glucocorticoid receptor polymorphisms were found.

We determined whether BCR-ABL continues to decline with longer imatinib exposure and the incidence and consequence of undetectable BCR-ABL. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: BCR-ABL levels were measured in a subset of 53 imatinib-treated IRIS trial patients for up to 7 years (29 first-line, 24 second-line). Levels were deemed undetectable using strict PCR sensitivity criteria. RESULTS: By 18 months, the majority achieved a 3-log reduction [major molecular response (MMR)]. BCR-ABL continued to decline but at a slower rate (median time to 4-log reduction and undetectable BCR-ABL of 45 and 66 months for first-line). The probability of undetectable BCR-ABL increased considerably from 36 to 81 months of first-line imatinib {7% [95% confidence interval (95% CI), 0-17%] versus 52% (95% CI, 32-72%)}. Undetectable BCR-ABL was achieved in 18 of 53 patients and none of these 18 lost MMR after a median follow-up of 33 months. Conversely, MMR was lost in 6 of 22 (27%) patients with sustained detectable BCR-ABL and was associated with BCR-ABL mutations in 3 of 6. Loss of MMR was recently defined as suboptimal imatinib response. There was no difference in the probability of achieving molecular responses between first- and second-line patients but first-line had a significantly higher probability of maintaining MMR [P = 0.03; 96% (95% CI, 88-100%) versus 71% (95% CI, 48-93%)]. CONCLUSIONS: With prolonged therapy, BCR-ABL continued to decline in most patients and undetectable BCR-ABL was no longer a rare event.

This study compared the influence of genetic and leukemia-specific factors on Pgp. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Eight hundred and seventeen samples were studied prospectively for Pgp protein expression and function and G1199A, G2677T, and C3435T polymorphisms in the encoding gene ABCB1. RESULTS: Age, low WBC count, high bcl-2, secondary AML and myelodysplastic syndrome, and adverse cytogenetics all correlated strongly with high Pgp (MRK16) protein expression. However, ABCB1 3435TT homozygosity was negatively correlated with Pgp. Pgp protein is only expressed in 41% of samples such that the negative effect of the polymorphism was not seen at baseline Pgp levels but was marked in the upper 41% of samples (MRK16 Deltamean fluorescence intensity of 75th centile sample = 9 units for TT variant samples and 26 units for CC/CT; P = 0.003). However, no association was found between genetic factors and Pgp function using rhodamine 123 accumulation. CONCLUSIONS: The genetic polymorphism 3435TT (which results in unstable mRNA) has a significant effect on Pgp expression, but this is only seen in approximately 40% of cases in which mRNA and protein are detectable. Moreover, leukemia-specific factors, such as low WBC count and poor risk cytogenetics, have a much greater effect than genetic polymorphisms on Pgp expression in AML blasts.","['Seedhouse, Claire H', 'Grundy, Martin', 'White, Paul', 'Li, Yun', 'Fisher, Janet', 'Yakunina, Darya', 'Moorman, Anthony V', 'Hoy, Terence', 'Russell, Nigel', 'Burnett, Alan', 'Pallis, Monica']","['Seedhouse CH', 'Grundy M', 'White P', 'Li Y', 'Fisher J', 'Yakunina D', 'Moorman AV', 'Hoy T', 'Russell N', 'Burnett A', 'Pallis M']","['Academic Haematology, Nottingham University Hospitals, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, United Kingdom.

In murine models of T-ALL, Notch-1 activation can both directly initiate leukemia and cooperate secondarily to other primary events. Whether acquisition of Notch-1 mutations is an early initiating event or a secondary event in the pathogenesis of human T-ALL is unclear. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We used denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography, sequencing, and fragment analysis to analyze Notch-1 mutational status and mutant level in 62 patients at presentation as well as 16 matched presentation-relapse samples. RESULTS: We detected Notch-1 mutations in 47 patients (76%). Seven of these were low-level mutations (quantified at < or =10%), despite high blast counts, suggesting that they were acquired as a secondary event in a subclone. Of 16 matched presentation-relapse samples studied, 7 were wild-type at both presentation and relapse. Five of nine mutant-positive patients at presentation relapsed with the same mutation(s) at the same high level. Four patients had evidence of a change in mutant at relapse. One lost a PEST mutation and became wild-type. Two others lost mutations at relapse but acquired different mutations, despite unchanged T-cell receptor rearrangements, suggesting that the latter event predated the acquisition of the Notch-1 mutation. One relapsed with a secondary T-cell leukemia and different Notch mutation. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that Notch-1 mutations can sometimes be acquired as secondary events in leukemogenesis and must be used cautiously as solitary minimal residual disease markers.","['Mansour, Marc R', 'Duke, Veronique', 'Foroni, Letizia', 'Patel, Bella', 'Allen, Christopher G', 'Ancliff, Phil J', 'Gale, Rosemary E', 'Linch, David C']","['Mansour MR', 'Duke V', 'Foroni L', 'Patel B', 'Allen CG', 'Ancliff PJ', 'Gale RE', 'Linch DC']","['Department of Haematology, University College London, UK. m.mansour@ucl.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (NOTCH1 protein, human)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Child', 'Chromosomal Instability', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*genetics', '*Mutation', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/genetics', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Receptor, Notch1/*genetics']",2007/12/07 09:00,2008/05/08 09:00,['2007/12/07 09:00'],"['2007/12/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/08 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['13/23/6964 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-07-1474 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2007 Dec 1;13(23):6964-9. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-07-1474.,,['G0500389/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A 20-mer asODN previously shown to target c-myb, a hematopoietic transcription factor, was covalently attached via a photocleavable linker (PL) to partially complementary 20-mer sense strands (sODNs). In the 'caged' state, the sODN blocked hybridization of the asODN to c-myb mRNA. Six asODN-PL-sODN conjugates, C1-C6, were synthesized. C5, with twelve complementary bases, gave the largest decrease in melting temperature (T(m)) upon UV irradiation (DeltaT(m) = -29 degrees C). The most thermally stable conjugate, C6 (T(m) = 84 degrees C), gave the lowest background RNase H activity, with just 8.6% degradation of an RNA 40-mer after 1 h incubation. In biochemical assays with C6, RNA digestion increased 10-fold 10 min after UV irradiation. Finally, phosphorothioated analogs S-C5 and S-C6 were synthesized to test activity in cultured K562 (human leukemia) cells. No knockdown of c-myb mRNA or protein was observed with intact S-C5 or S-C6, whereas more than half of c-myb mRNA was degraded 24 h after photoactivation. Two-fold photomodulation of c-MYB protein levels was also observed with S-C5. However, no photomodulation of c-MYB protein levels was observed with S-C6, perhaps due to the greater stability of this duplex.","['Tang, XinJing', 'Swaminathan, Jyothishmathi', 'Gewirtz, Alan M', 'Dmochowski, Ivan J']","['Tang X', 'Swaminathan J', 'Gewirtz AM', 'Dmochowski IJ']","['The Department of Chemistry, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071201,England,Nucleic Acids Res,Nucleic acids research,0411011,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', 'EC 3.1.26.4 (Ribonuclease H)']",IM,"['DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/radiation effects', 'Genes, myb', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Nucleic Acid Denaturation', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides, Antisense/*chemistry/radiation effects', 'Photochemistry', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'RNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Ribonuclease H/metabolism', 'Ultraviolet Rays']",2007/12/07 09:00,2008/03/18 09:00,['2007/12/07 09:00'],"['2007/12/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/18 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['gkm1029 [pii]', '10.1093/nar/gkm1029 [doi]']",ppublish,Nucleic Acids Res. 2008 Feb;36(2):559-69. doi: 10.1093/nar/gkm1029.

Trends in the use of this procedure have appeared erratic in the past. Information on future needs is essential for health care administrators. DESIGN AND METHODS: We analyzed the evolution of transplant rates, e.g. numbers of transplants per 10 million inhabitants, in Europe from 1990 to 2004 for all major disease categories and used Gross National Income (GNI) per capita, team density (numbers of teams per 10 million inhabitants) and team distribution (numbers of teams per 10,000 km2) to measure the impact of economic factors in participating countries. Trends were compared by regression analyses, and countries were grouped by World Bank definitions into high, middle and low income categories. RESULTS: Transplant rates increased over time with nearly linear trends, in clear association with GNI per capita (R2=0.72), and distinct by World Bank category within a narrow window of variation for both autologous HSCT (R2=0.95, 0.98 and 0.94 for high, middle and low income categories, respectively) and allogeneic HSCT (R2=0.99, 0.96 and 0.95 for high, middle and low income categories, respectively) when breast cancer (autologous) and chronic myeloid leukemia (allogeneic) were excluded. Team density (R2=0.72) and team distribution (R2=0.51) were also associated with transplant rates. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Transplant rates for HSCT in Europe are highly predictable. They are primarily influenced by GNI per capita. The absence of saturation and a nearly linear trend indicate that infrastructure lags behind medical needs.

Controversy exists whether, in addition to PFN/GrB-mediated apoptosis, death receptor-induced apoptosis contributes to the elimination of human tumor cells by CTL. DESIGN AND METHODS: Since the two CTL-mediated effector mechanisms differ in time required to eliminate target cells, lysis of target cells was analyzed using CTL clones with slow and rapid kinetics of killing derived from a patient with chronic myeloid leukemia. To determine the involvement of the death receptor pathway, a retroviral construct encoding the antiapoptotic gene FLICE inhibitory protein (FLIP) was introduced into these target cells. RESULTS: A CTL clone capable of killing 50% of the target cells within 2 hours of incubation primarily acted by release of PFN and GrB. In contrast, two CTL clones showing slower target cell killing kinetics partially used the death receptor pathway (approximately 30% inhibition by FLIP). INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that the death receptor pathway contributes to T-cell-mediated cell death if not all target cells are destroyed by release of PFN and GrB.","['de Vries, Jeltje F', 'von dem Borne, Peter A', 'van Luxemburg-Heijs, Simone A P', 'Heemskerk, Mirjam H M', 'Willemze, Roel', 'Falkenburg, J H Frederik', 'Barge, Renee M Y']","['de Vries JF', 'von dem Borne PA', 'van Luxemburg-Heijs SA', 'Heemskerk MH', 'Willemze R', 'Falkenburg JH', 'Barge RM']","['Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, P.O.

Primary chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells overexpress TSPO. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of PK11195 on CLL cells. Table 1. Characteristics of the patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. DESIGN AND METHODS: Using cytometric analysis, we studied the cytotoxic effects of PK11195 on peripheral B and T lymphocytes from patients with CLL and from healthy donors. Western blot and cytometric analyses were used to study the mitochondrial effects of PK11195 on CLL cells. Moreover, we analyzed the cytotoxic effect of PK11195 in patients' cells with mutated p53 or ATM. RESULTS: PK11195 induces apoptosis and had additive effects with chemotherapeutic drugs in primary CLL cells. Other TSPO ligands such as RO 5-4864 and FGIN-1-27 also induce apoptosis in CLL cells. PK11195 induces mitochondrial depolarization and cytochrome c release upstream of caspase activation, and dithiocyana-tostilbene-2,2- disulfonic acid (DIDS), a voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) inhibitor, inhibits PK11195-induced apoptosis, demonstrating a direct involvement of mitochondria. CLL cells and normal B cells are more sensitive than T cells to PK11195-induced apoptosis. Interestingly, PK11195 induced apoptosis in CLL cells irrespective of their p53 or ATM status. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that PK11195 alone or in combination with chemotherapeutic drugs might be a new therapeutic option for the treatment of CLL.","['Santidrian, Antonio F', 'Cosialls, Ana M', 'Coll-Mulet, Llorenc', 'Iglesias-Serret, Daniel', 'de Frias, Merce', 'Gonzalez-Girones, Diana M', 'Campas, Clara', 'Domingo, Alicia', 'Pons, Gabriel', 'Gil, Joan']","['Santidrian AF', 'Cosialls AM', 'Coll-Mulet L', 'Iglesias-Serret D', 'de Frias M', 'Gonzalez-Girones DM', 'Campas C', 'Domingo A', 'Pons G', 'Gil J']","[""Departament de Ciencies Fisiologiques II, IDIBELL-Universitat de Barcelona, L'Hospitalet de Llobregat, Spain.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzodiazepinones)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Hypolipidemic Agents)', '0 (Indoleacetic Acids)', '0 (Isoquinolines)', '0 (Receptors, GABA)', '0 (TSPO protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (Voltage-Dependent Anion Channels)', '142720-24-9 (N,N-di-n-hexyl-2-(4-fluorophenyl)indole-3-acetamide)', ""2QW0IK1742 (4'-chlorodiazepam)"", '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (ATM protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', ""Q1O6DSW23R (4,4'-Diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-Disulfonic Acid)"", 'YNF83VN1RL (PK 11195)']",IM,"[""4,4'-Diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-Disulfonic Acid/pharmacology"", 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins', 'B-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Benzodiazepinones/pharmacology', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hypolipidemic Agents/pharmacology', 'Indoleacetic Acids/pharmacology', 'Isoquinolines/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitochondria/metabolism', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, GABA/genetics/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Voltage-Dependent Anion Channels/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism']",2007/12/07 09:00,2008/04/02 09:00,['2007/12/07 09:00'],"['2007/12/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/02 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['92/12/1631 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.11194 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2007 Dec;92(12):1631-8. doi: 10.3324/haematol.11194.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The T-LBL/ALL-GOELAL02 study evaluated the impact of randomized reinduction chemotherapy against intensified conditioning followed by autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT), after an induction regimen of the type used for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). DESIGN AND METHODS: Patients with favorable characteristics were randomized to receive chemotherapy or ASCT. Patients with unfavorable characteristics (bone marrow involvement and age over 35 years old or leukocytosis >30 x 10(9)/L or failure to achieve medullar complete remission [CR] after one induction course) received a second induction course and ASCT. RESULTS: Among 45 patients, the CR rate was 71% after induction and 87% after a second induction course. Within the group of 27 patients with favorable characteristics, ten received ASCT and 17 chemotherapy. Ten patients in the group with unfavorable characteristics received ASCT. The 7-year overall survival and progression-free survival rates were 64 and 65%, respectively.

As(2)O(3), Phenylbutyrate (PB) and G-CSF are known to potentiate ATRA effects. Our aim was to analyze the changes in expression and function of adhesion molecules induced by ATRA, As(2)O(3), G-CSF and PB, and their association. DESIGN AND METHODS: APL blasts and NB4 cells were treated with ATRA, As(2)O(3), PB, G-CSF or their association and the expression of adhesion molecules was determined by flow cytometry. Cell adhesion was evaluated in vitro using Matrigel and for the in vivo analysis, Balb-c mice were injected with NB4 cells pre-treated with ATRA, As(2)O(3), ATRA+G-CSF or ATRA+As(2)O(3). In addition, CD54 and CD18 knock-out mice were injected with NB4 cells and concomitantly treated with ATRA. In both models, the MPO activity in the lungs was determined 6 hours after the injection of the cells. RESULTS: In NB4 and APL blasts, ATRA and As(2)O(3) increased CD54 expression, but no synergism was detected. CD11b and CD18 were also up-regulated by ATRA in primary cells. PB and G-CSF had no effect, but the latter potentiated ATRA-induced CD18 up-regulation. These changes were accompanied by increased adhesion to Matrigel and to lung microvasculature, and reversed by anti-CD54, anti-CD18 antibodies. In CD54 and CD18 knock-out mice the ATRA effect was canceled. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: The use of As(2)O(3), PB and G-CSF in association with ATRA should not aggravate DS in APL.","['Cunha De Santis, Gil', 'Tamarozzi, Mirela de Barros', 'Sousa, Romualdo Barroso', 'Moreno, Susana Elisa', 'Secco, Daniela', 'Garcia, Aglair Bergamo', 'Lima, Ana Silvia Gouveia', 'Faccioli, Lucia Helena', 'Falcao, Roberto Passetto', 'Cunha, Fernando Queiros', 'Rego, Eduardo Magalhaes']","['Cunha De Santis G', 'Tamarozzi MB', 'Sousa RB', 'Moreno SE', 'Secco D', 'Garcia AB', 'Lima AS', 'Faccioli LH', 'Falcao RP', 'Cunha FQ', 'Rego EM']","['Hematology Division and Center for Cell Based Therapy, Department of Internal Medicine, Medical School of Ribeirao Preto, University of Sao Paulo, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Phenylbutyrates)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Antineoplastic Agents/agonists/*pharmacology', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/agonists/*pharmacology', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects/genetics', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/agonists/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Oxides/agonists/*pharmacology', 'Phenylbutyrates/agonists/*pharmacology', 'Syndrome', 'Tretinoin/agonists/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2007/12/07 09:00,2008/04/02 09:00,['2007/12/07 09:00'],"['2007/12/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/02 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['92/12/1615 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.10607 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2007 Dec;92(12):1615-22. doi: 10.3324/haematol.10607.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We demonstrate here that FANC pathway loss-of-function results in the aberrant activation of 2 major stress-signaling pathways: NF-kappaB and MAPKs. These responses are independent on TNF-alpha expression. On the contrary, inhibition of the MAPK pathways normalizes TNF-alpha oversecretion in FA. Moreover, our data show that the overexpression of the matrix metalloproteinase MMP-7 is the key event directly responsible for the high rate of TNF-alpha shedding and release from the cytoplasmic membrane in FA. TNF-alpha overproduction is, indeed, normalized by MMP-7 inhibition. Finally, MAPK inhibition impacts on MMP-7 overexpression. Evidence is provided of the existence of a linear pathway in which FANC mutations activate MAPK signaling that induces MMP-7 overexpression leading, in fine, to TNF-alpha oversecretion. TNF-alpha may, in turn, sustain or amplify both MAPKs and NF-kappaB activation. Aberrant expression or activity of NF-kappaB and/or MAPKs has been already involved in bone marrow failure and leukemia, and their inhibition offered clinical benefit for patients. In conclusion, our data provide a strong rationale for new clinical trials on FA patients.","['Briot, Delphine', 'Mace-Aime, Gaetane', 'Subra, Frederic', 'Rosselli, Filippo']","['Briot D', 'Mace-Aime G', 'Subra F', 'Rosselli F']","['Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) FRE2939, Universite Paris-Sud, Institut Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071130,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases)']",IM,"['Actins/genetics', 'Fanconi Anemia/*genetics', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Luciferases/genetics', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases/genetics/physiology', 'NF-kappa B/genetics/physiology', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*genetics']",2007/12/07 09:00,2008/05/22 09:00,['2007/12/07 09:00'],"['2007/12/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/22 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)44584-7 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2007-07-099218 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2008 Feb 15;111(4):1913-23. doi: 10.1182/blood-2007-07-099218.

Development of CD8alpha(+) DCs and pDCs requires the interferon regulatory factor 8 (IRF8). Recently, a spontaneous point mutation was identified in the Irf8/Icsbp gene in the BXH2 mouse, which exhibits an immunodeficient phenotype similar to the IRF8 knockout (KO) mouse. We show that this mutation, designated IRF8(R294C), abolishes the development of CD8alpha(+) DCs without impairing pDC development, and eliminates production of IL12p40, while retaining that of type I IFNs. Electrophoretic mobility shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays indicated that IRF8(R294C) failed to interact with partner transcription factors and did not bind certain promoters that require partner interactions. Together, this work indicates that IRF8-partner interactions play different roles in CD8alpha(+) DCs and pDCs, revealing a mechanistic separation that underlies development of these DC subsets.","['Tailor, Prafullakumar', 'Tamura, Tomohiko', 'Morse, Herbert C 3rd', 'Ozato, Keiko']","['Tailor P', 'Tamura T', 'Morse HC 3rd', 'Ozato K']","['Laboratory of Molecular Growth Regulation, National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892-2753, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20071130,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Interferon Regulatory Factors)', '0 (interferon regulatory factor-8)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Substitution', 'Animals', 'Crosses, Genetic', 'Dendritic Cells/immunology/*physiology', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Immunity, Innate', 'Interferon Regulatory Factors/*genetics', 'Leukemia/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mutation', 'Spleen/immunology']",2007/12/07 09:00,2008/05/22 09:00,['2007/12/07 09:00'],"['2007/12/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/22 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)44587-2 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2007-07-100750 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2008 Feb 15;111(4):1942-5. doi: 10.1182/blood-2007-07-100750.

The UK LRF CLL4 trial is the largest prospective trial in CLL to examine the prognostic impact of both a positive direct antiglobulin test (DAT) and AHA. Seven-hundred seventy-seven patients were randomized to receive chlorambucil or fludarabine, alone or with cyclophosphamide (FC). The incidence pretreatment of a positive DAT was 14%. Ten percent developed AHA. The DAT correctly predicted the development, or not, of AHA after therapy in 83% of cases, however only 28% of DAT-positive patients developed AHA. Of 299 patients tested both before and after treatment, those treated with single-agent fludarabine were most likely to remain DAT positive and to change from negative to positive. Patients treated with chlorambucil or fludarabine were more than twice as likely to develop AHA as those receiving FC. In a multivariate analysis, stage C disease and high beta2 microglobulin were independent predictors of a positive DAT result. AHA, or a positive DAT, with or without AHA, independently predicted for reduced overall survival (OS). Four deaths, all on fludarabine monotherapy, were attributed to AHA.

Patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia were first screened for JAK2 and NPM1 mutations, and 3 patients with mutations were identified. Mutant allele percentages in mononuclear cell DNA were followed after treatment, along with methylation of LINE1 and 10 other genes. The clearance of mutant alleles was modest after the first cycle, despite induction of hypomethylation. Delayed substantial clearance was observed after 2 to 4 cycles that correlated with clinical response. Two patients had complete disappearance of mutant alleles and sustained clinical remissions. In another patient, mutant allele was detectable at clinical remission, which lasted for 8 months.

We previously used a mouse lymphoma model to demonstrate that the translation initiation factor eIF4E is a potent oncogene in vivo. Using the same model, we now show that the oncogenic activity of eIF4E correlates with its ability to activate translation and become phosphorylated on Ser 209. Furthermore, constitutively activated MNK1, an eIF4E Ser 209 kinase, promotes tumorigenesis in a manner similar to eIF4E, and a dominant-negative MNK mutant inhibits the in vivo proliferation of tumor cells driven by mutations that deregulate translation. Phosphorylated eIF4E promotes tumorigenesis primarily by suppressing apoptosis and, accordingly, the anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1 is one target of both phospho-eIF4E and MNK1 that contributes to tumor formation.

To overcome the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) disparity, in vivo T-cell purging by the pre-transplant administration of antithymocyte globulin followed by a conventional prophylactic treatment against graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) resulted in an avoidance of severe GVHD as well as infectious complications. The patient has maintained complete remission for 13 months after haploidentical HSCT, indicating that a graft-versus-PCL effect might be preserved. Haploidentical HSCT can be a potentially curative treatment for patients with primary PCL who do not have an HLA-identical donor.","['Nonami, Atsushi', 'Miyamoto, Toshihiro', 'Kuroiwa, Mika', 'Kunisaki, Yuya', 'Kamezaki, Kenjiro', 'Takenaka, Katsuto', 'Harada, Naoki', 'Teshima, Takanori', 'Harada, Mine', 'Nagafuji, Koji']","['Nonami A', 'Miyamoto T', 'Kuroiwa M', 'Kunisaki Y', 'Kamezaki K', 'Takenaka K', 'Harada N', 'Teshima T', 'Harada M', 'Nagafuji K']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyushu University, 3-1-1 Maidashi, Higashi-ku, Fukuoka 812-8582, Japan. anonamin@yahoo.co.jp']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071130,England,Jpn J Clin Oncol,Japanese journal of clinical oncology,0313225,"['0 (Antilymphocyte Serum)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antilymphocyte Serum/administration & dosage', 'Bone Marrow Purging', 'Graft vs Host Disease/prevention & control', '*Haplotypes', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/administration & dosage', 'Leukemia, Plasma Cell/genetics/*surgery', 'Male', '*Siblings', 'T-Lymphocytes', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",2007/12/07 09:00,2008/02/05 09:00,['2007/12/07 09:00'],"['2007/12/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/05 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['hym130 [pii]', '10.1093/jjco/hym130 [doi]']",ppublish,Jpn J Clin Oncol. 2007 Dec;37(12):969-72. doi: 10.1093/jjco/hym130.

Inasmuch as cardiotrophin-1 (CT-1), an IL-6-type cytokine, was expressed in human atherosclerotic plaque, we examined whether CT-1 induces monocyte adhesion and migration by stimulating gene and protein expressions of ICAM-1 and MCP-1 in human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs). Immunocytochemistry revealed that CT-1 increased intensity of ICAM-1 and MCP-1 immunoreactivity in HAECs. Adhesion assay and chemotaxis assay revealed that CT-1 increased human monocytic THP-1 cell adhesion to HAECs and promoted chemotaxis in THP-1 cells, which were attenuated by anti-ICAM-1 and anti-MCP-1 antibody, respectively. Western blot analysis showed that CT-1 increased phosphorylation of ERK1/2 MAP kinase, p38 MAP kinase, and Akt and that their inhibitors, PD-98059, SB-203580, and LY-294002, respectively, inhibited phosphorylation. RNase protection assay and ELISA demonstrated that CT-1 increased gene and protein expressions of ICAM-1 and MCP-1. EMSA revealed that CT-1 enhanced NF-kappaB DNA-binding activity. CT-1-mediated upregulation of ICAM-1 and MCP-1 was suppressed by PD-98059, SB-203580, LY-294002, and parthenolide. The present study demonstrates that CT-1 promotes monocyte adhesion and migration by stimulating ICAM-1 and MCP-1 through mechanisms that involve ERK1/2 MAP kinase, p38 MAP kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and NF-kappaB pathways and suggests that CT-1 plays an important role in the pathophysiology of vascular inflammation and atherosclerosis.","['Ichiki, Tomoko', 'Jougasaki, Michihisa', 'Setoguchi, Manabu', 'Imamura, Junichi', 'Nakashima, Hitoshi', 'Matsuoka, Tatsuru', 'Sonoda, Masahiro', 'Nakamura, Kazuhiko', 'Minagoe, Shinichi', 'Tei, Chuwa']","['Ichiki T', 'Jougasaki M', 'Setoguchi M', 'Imamura J', 'Nakashima H', 'Matsuoka T', 'Sonoda M', 'Nakamura K', 'Minagoe S', 'Tei C']","['Institute for Clinical Research, National Hospital Organization Kagoshima Medical Center, 8-1 Shiroyama-cho, Kagoshima 892-0853, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071130,United States,Am J Physiol Heart Circ Physiol,American journal of physiology.

Previously, we demonstrated that FKHRL1 functions downstream of Akt in erythropoietin (EPO) signaling and that it is directly phosphorylated by activated Akt. Because phosphorylated FKHRL1 loses its transcriptional activity and translocates into the cytoplasm, FKHRL1 appears to be nonfunctional in the presence of EPO. Conversely, EPO deprivation leads to FKHRL1 dephosphorylation and its translocation into the nucleus, suggesting that FKHRL1 becomes active as a transcription factor in the absence of EPO. On the basis of these findings, we hypothesized, by analogy with C elegans, that erythroid cells possess self-defense machinery against life-threatening surroundings. We prepared a dominant-negative mutant of FKHRL1 (FKHRL1-DN) lacking the transactivation domain and prepared FKHRL1 small interfering RNA (siRNA), and we used constructs to transfect a human EPO-dependent cell line, UT-7/EPO. In the parental cells, 24-hour EPO deprivation induced transient cell cycle arrest without apoptosis. On the other hand, stable transfectants expressing FKHRL1-DN or FKHRL1 siRNA underwent rapid apoptosis after EPO deprivation in the UT-7/EPO cells. In conclusion, FKHRL1 activation plays an important role in the extension of survival of erythroid cells after EPO deprivation. This phenomenon appears to correspond to dauer formation in C elegans. Thus, the mechanism of lifespan extension may be broadly conserved from C elegans to humans.","['Uchida, Mie', 'Kirito, Keita', 'Endo, Hitoshi', 'Ozawa, Keiya', 'Komatsu, Norio']","['Uchida M', 'Kirito K', 'Endo H', 'Ozawa K', 'Komatsu N']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Jichi Medical University, Tochigi, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (FOXO3 protein, human)', '0 (Forkhead Box Protein O3)', '0 (Forkhead Transcription Factors)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', 'Erythroid Cells/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Erythropoietin/*pharmacology', 'Forkhead Box Protein O3', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Protein Transport', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics']",2007/12/07 09:00,2008/03/12 09:00,['2007/12/07 09:00'],"['2007/12/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/12 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['A70K583W61376K58 [pii]', '10.1532/IJH97.07093 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2007 Nov;86(4):315-24. doi: 10.1532/IJH97.07093.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Over the past decade, epigenetic changes such as alterations in DNA methylation and histone modifications have been well described in MDS and are now recognized as targets of therapy (epigenetic therapy). The aim of epigenetic therapy is to reverse epigenetic changes and reactivate important genes, thereby modifying the malignant phenotype and inducing the clearance of the malignant clone via various mechanisms. Epigenetic-modifying agents may also have mechanisms of anticancer action unrelated to gene reactivation. The hypomethylating agents azacitidine and decitabine induce clinically meaningful remissions or improvements in 30% to 60% of patients with this disease, and both agents have been approved in the United States for the treatment of advanced and/or symptomatic MDS. Histone deacetylase inhibitors belong to another class of epigenetic-modifying agents that also have clinical activity in MDS. They are currently being combined with hypomethylating agents. Among other available therapeutic options, allogeneic stem cell transplantation is the only curative approach for MDS but is also characterized by significant morbidities and mortality. We review epigenetic therapy and other therapeutic approaches for patients with advanced MDS.","['Oki, Yasuhiro', 'Issa, Jean-Pierre J']","['Oki Y', 'Issa JP']","['Department of Hematology and Cell Therapy, Aichi Cancer Center, Nagoya, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (DNA Modification Methylases)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'DNA Modification Methylases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Disease Progression', 'Epigenesis, Genetic/*genetics', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Histone Deacetylases/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/enzymology/*pathology/surgery/*therapy', 'Stem Cell Transplantation']",2007/12/07 09:00,2008/03/12 09:00,['2007/12/07 09:00'],"['2007/12/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/12 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['T576773460M3122N [pii]', '10.1532/IJH97.07034 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2007 Nov;86(4):306-14. doi: 10.1532/IJH97.07034.,,,,,,,,105,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) mast cells offer excellent potential for biosensor applications because they are robust and undergo a dramatic exocytotic response within minutes of antigen addition. To monitor mast cell activation, fluorescent dyes were loaded into the cells and used as indicators of alkalinization of secretory granules, calcium fluxes or generation of reactive oxygen species. These fluorescence assays efficiently measure activation of antigen-stimulated RBL mast cells, detecting the antigen with picomolar sensitivity. To demonstrate the utility of this mast cell-based biosensor for detection of microbial pathogens, an IgE chimeric protein was created by fusing the Fc region of the IgE antibody to CD14, a receptor for lipopolysaccharide. This chimeric protein has the capacity to bind to Escherichia coli and Listeria monocytogenes and also to IgE receptors on the mast cells, thereby stimulating a signaling response to bacteria. RBL mast cells labeled with the calcium indicator Fluo-4 are shown to be responsive to E. coli, only when sensitized with the chimeric protein, thus demonstrating a highly versatile biosensor for bacterial contamination.","['Curtis, Theresa', 'Naal, Rose Mary Z G', 'Batt, Carl', 'Tabb, Joel', 'Holowka, David']","['Curtis T', 'Naal RM', 'Batt C', 'Tabb J', 'Holowka D']","['Agave BioSystems, Ithaca, NY 14850, USA. curtist@cortland.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20071024,England,Biosens Bioelectron,Biosensors & bioelectronics,9001289,,IM,"['Animals', 'Biological Assay/*instrumentation/methods', 'Biosensing Techniques/*instrumentation/methods', 'Cell Line', 'Colony Count, Microbial/*instrumentation/methods', 'Equipment Design', 'Equipment Failure Analysis', 'Escherichia coli/*isolation & purification', 'Immunoassay/*instrumentation/methods', 'Mast Cells/*microbiology', 'Rats', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence/*instrumentation/methods']",2007/12/07 09:00,2008/05/07 09:00,['2007/12/07 09:00'],"['2007/06/01 00:00 [received]', '2007/09/21 00:00 [revised]', '2007/10/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/12/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/07 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0956-5663(07)00437-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.bios.2007.10.007 [doi]']",ppublish,Biosens Bioelectron. 2008 Feb 28;23(7):1024-31. doi: 10.1016/j.bios.2007.10.007.

In Western countries, expansion and ageing of the population as well as progress in cancer detection using new diagnostic and screening tests cannot fully account for the observed growing incidence of cancer. Our hypothesis is that environmental factors play a more important role in cancer genesis than it is usually agreed. (1) Over the last 2-3 decades, alcohol consumption and tobacco smoking in men have significantly decreased in Western Europe and North America. (2) Obesity is increasing in many countries, but the growing incidence of cancer also concerns cancers not related to obesity nor to other known lifestyle-related factors. (3) There is evidence that the environment has changed over the time period preceding the recent rise in cancer incidence, and that this change, still continuing, included the accumulation of many new carcinogenic factors in the environment. (4) Genetic susceptibility to cancer due to genetic polymorphism cannot have changed over one generation and actually favours the role of exogenous factors through gene-environment interactions. (5) Age is not the unique factor to be considered since the rising incidence of cancers is seen across all age categories, including children, and adolescents. (6) The fetus is specifically vulnerable to exogenous factors. A fetal exposure during a critical time window may explain why current epidemiological studies may still be negative in adults. We therefore propose that the involuntary exposure to many carcinogens in the environment, including microorganisms (viruses, bacteria and parasites), radiations (radioactivity, UV and pulsed electromagnetic fields) and many xenochemicals, may account for the recent growing incidence of cancer and therefore that the risk attributable to environmental carcinogen may be far higher than it is usually agreed. Of major concern are: outdoor air pollution by carbon particles associated with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; indoor air pollution by environmental tobacco smoke, formaldehyde and volatile organic compounds such as benzene and 1,3 butadiene, which may particularly affect children and food contamination by food additives and by carcinogenic contaminants such as nitrates, pesticides, dioxins and other organochlorines. In addition, carcinogenic metals and metalloids, pharmaceutical medicines and some ingredients and contaminants in cosmetics may be involved. Although the risk fraction attributable to environmental factors is still unknown, this long list of carcinogenic and especially mutagenic factors supports our working hypothesis according to which numerous cancers may in fact be caused by the recent modification of our environment.","['Irigaray, P', 'Newby, J A', 'Clapp, R', 'Hardell, L', 'Howard, V', 'Montagnier, L', 'Epstein, S', 'Belpomme, D']","['Irigaray P', 'Newby JA', 'Clapp R', 'Hardell L', 'Howard V', 'Montagnier L', 'Epstein S', 'Belpomme D']","['Cancer Research Center, Association for Research and Treatments Against Cancer (ARTAC), 57-59 Rue de la Convention, 75015 Paris, France. philippei.artac@gmail.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20071120,France,Biomed Pharmacother,Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,8213295,"['0 (Air Pollutants)', '0 (Environmental Pollutants)']",IM,"['Aging/physiology', 'Air Pollutants/toxicity', 'Alcohol Drinking/adverse effects', 'Child', 'Diet', 'Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions', 'Environmental Pollutants/*toxicity', 'Exercise/physiology', 'Food Contamination', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/epidemiology', 'Life Expectancy', '*Life Style', 'Neoplasms/*chemically induced/epidemiology/genetics', 'Obesity/complications', 'Occupational Diseases/epidemiology', 'Oncogenic Viruses', 'Overweight/complications', 'Smoking/adverse effects']",2007/12/07 09:00,2008/02/15 09:00,['2007/12/07 09:00'],"['2007/10/04 00:00 [received]', '2007/10/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/12/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/15 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0753-3322(07)00229-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.biopha.2007.10.006 [doi]']",ppublish,Biomed Pharmacother. 2007 Dec;61(10):640-58. doi: 10.1016/j.biopha.2007.10.006.

In this study, the activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) was found to be critical for the induction of apoptosis and subcellular redistribution of Bax. Pharmacological inhibition of p38 MAPK with SB203580 or expression of a dominant-negative p38 MAPK attenuated DNA fragmentation, caspase-3 activation, and Bax translocation in response to ceramide. Overexpression of Akt also led to suppression of Bax translocation to mitochondria during ceramide-induced apoptosis in HL-60 cells. We also provide evidence for cross-talk between p38 MAPK and Akt pathways. Expression of myr-Akt or inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) with LY294002 had no effect on p38 MAPK activation by ceramide as assessed by phosphorylation, while inhibition of p38 MAPK by a pharmacological inhibitor or a dominant-negative p38 inhibited Akt dephosphorylation in response to ceramide, suggesting that ceramide-induced p38 MAPK activation negatively regulates the Akt pathway.","['Kim, Hae Jong', 'Oh, Ji Eun', 'Kim, Sang Woo', 'Chun, Young Jin', 'Kim, Mie Young']","['Kim HJ', 'Oh JE', 'Kim SW', 'Chun YJ', 'Kim MY']","['Division of Biochemistry, College of Pharmacy, Chung-Ang University, Seoul 156-756, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071128,Ireland,Cancer Lett,Cancer letters,7600053,"['0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (Ceramides)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'OU13V1EYWQ (SB 203580)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Ceramides/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/enzymology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mitochondria/metabolism', 'Mutation', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Protein Transport', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Pyridines/pharmacology', '*Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Time Factors', 'Transfection', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/*metabolism', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism']",2007/12/07 09:00,2008/04/09 09:00,['2007/12/07 09:00'],"['2007/07/10 00:00 [received]', '2007/10/16 00:00 [revised]', '2007/10/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/12/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/09 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0304-3835(07)00508-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.canlet.2007.10.030 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Lett. 2008 Feb 18;260(1-2):88-95. doi: 10.1016/j.canlet.2007.10.030.

It is thought to be the leading mould pathogen in leukaemia and transplant patients and is responsible for mortality in a large number of individuals with immunological disorders. In an attempt to develop molecular mutagenesis tools for assessment of this organism, the genome of A. fumigatus was analysed to identify possible functional transposable elements. An apparently intact Fot1/Pogo type transposon with 65% identity to the active Tan1 element of Aspergillus niger was identified and designated Aft1. Aft1 is a 1.9kb element present in multiple (>20) highly conserved copies. It encodes a 332 amino acid transposase which contains all the functional motifs required for transposition. In addition, the transposase was expressed in cultures grown at 37 degrees C in all three strains assessed and excision analysis suggests Aft1 may be active and of use in transposon tagging experiments. Southern hybridisation patterns indicate that Aft1 is widely distributed amongst clinical isolates of A. fumigatus with considerable variation in genomic localisation. A comprehensive analysis of the genomic localisation of Aft1 in the sequenced strain AF293 show that one insertion is 30 bases upstream of a predicted gene encoding a G-protein coupled receptor. Expression analysis indicates that this gene has been inactivated by the insertion.","['Hey, Peter', 'Robson, Geoff', 'Birch, Mike', 'Bromley, Mike']","['Hey P', 'Robson G', 'Birch M', 'Bromley M']","['F2G Ltd, Lankro Way, Eccles, Manchester M30 OBH, UK; The University of Manchester, Oxford Road, Manchester M13 9PL, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20071023,United States,Fungal Genet Biol,Fungal genetics and biology : FG & B,9607601,"['0 (DNA Transposable Elements)', '0 (Receptors, CCR10)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Aspergillosis/microbiology', 'Aspergillus fumigatus/*genetics', 'DNA Transposable Elements/*genetics', '*Genome, Fungal', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Open Reading Frames/genetics', 'Receptors, CCR10/genetics', 'Sequence Alignment']",2007/12/07 09:00,2008/02/20 09:00,['2007/12/07 09:00'],"['2007/01/12 00:00 [received]', '2007/09/13 00:00 [revised]', '2007/10/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/12/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/20 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1087-1845(07)00190-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.fgb.2007.10.009 [doi]']",ppublish,Fungal Genet Biol. 2008 Feb;45(2):117-26. doi: 10.1016/j.fgb.2007.10.009.

A promising approach to reverse MDR is the combined use of nontoxic and potent P-gp inhibitor with conventional anticancer drugs. We have examined the potential of a newly synthesized tetrahydroisoquinoline derivative B3 as a MDR-reversing agent. The MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay was used to examine the effect of B3 on the cytotoxicity in K562/A02 and MCF-7/ADM cells caused by doxorubicin (adriamycin). Accumulation and efflux of P-gp substrate rhodamine123 in K562/A02 and primary cultured rat brain microvessel endothelial cells (RBMECs) were measured to evaluate the inhibitory effect of B3 on P-gp. The K562/A02 xenograft model in nude mice was established to examine MDR-reversing efficacy of B3 in-vivo. The results indicated that co-administration of B3 resulted in an increase on chemosensitivity of K562/A02 and MCF-7/ADM cells to doxorubicin in a dose-dependent manner. Rhodamine123 accumulation in K562/A02 cells and RBMECs were significantly enhanced after the incubation with various concentrations of B3. Furthermore, B3 inhibited the efflux of rhodamine123 from RBMECs. Co-administration of B3 with doxorubicin significantly decreased weight and volume of tumour in nude mice. In conclusion, B3 is a novel and potent MDR reversal agent with the potential to be an adjunctive agent for tumour chemotherapy.","['Fang, Weirong', 'Li, Yunman', 'Cai, Ying', 'Kang, Kai', 'Yan, Fang', 'Liu, Guoqing', 'Huang, Wenlong']","['Fang W', 'Li Y', 'Cai Y', 'Kang K', 'Yan F', 'Liu G', 'Huang W']","['Department of Physiology, China Pharmaceutical University, Mailbox 207, Tongjiaxiang 24, Nanjing, Jiangsu 210009, P.

The classification error rates are computed on three famous public databases (Leukemia, Colon and Prostate) and compared with those from other wrapper methods (RFE, lo norm SVM, Random Forests).

However, low transduction efficiencies may hamper the efficacy of such therapeutic strategies in the clinical setting. Most commonly, gammaretroviral gene transfer into T cells is conducted through spinoculation, that is, centrifugation of retroviral particles and T cells on RetroNectin-coated non-tissue culture vessels. Here we present data investigating the impact of temperature, speed, and frequency of spinoculation on T cell transduction efficiencies. We found that all three variables independently impacted gene transfer, with increasing temperature, speed, and frequency of spinoculation all enhancing the transduction of T cells. These improved conditions were additive, with the greatest proportion of transduced T cells being generated at the highest tested temperature and speed, after daily spinoculation for 2 to 3 days. Under these conditions, enhanced gene transfer was observed in T cells derived from healthy donors, using research-grade vector stocks. Whereas both RetroNectin and spinoculation were critical to optimal gene transduction, preloading of gammaretroviral particles before spinoculation did not enhance gene transfer. Significantly, application of these enhanced transduction conditions to T cells derived from previously treated patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia allowed for adequate gene transfer under both small-scale and large-scale clinically applicable conditions using either preclinical or current Good Manufacturing Practice-grade gammaretroviral vector stocks.","['Quintas-Cardama, Alfonso', 'Yeh, Raymond K', 'Hollyman, Daniel', 'Stefanski, Jolanta', 'Taylor, Clare', 'Nikhamin, Yan', 'Imperato, Gavin', 'Sadelain, Michel', 'Riviere, Isabelle', 'Brentjens, Renier J']","['Quintas-Cardama A', 'Yeh RK', 'Hollyman D', 'Stefanski J', 'Taylor C', 'Nikhamin Y', 'Imperato G', 'Sadelain M', 'Riviere I', 'Brentjens RJ']","['Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Hum Gene Ther,Human gene therapy,9008950,,IM,"['Centrifugation', '*Genetic Therapy', 'Genetic Vectors/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', '*T-Lymphocytes', 'Temperature', 'Transduction, Genetic/*methods']",2007/12/07 09:00,2008/02/09 09:00,['2007/12/07 09:00'],"['2007/12/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/09 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/07 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/hum.2007.088 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Gene Ther. 2007 Dec;18(12):1253-60. doi: 10.1089/hum.2007.088.,,"['P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA95152/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA-088748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA086438/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['Hum Gene Ther. 2008 Jun;19(6):655-6; author reply 657-8.

Their short biological half-life and severe side effects limit their use. A new delivery method for these drugs based on 4-5 nm gold nanoparticles can potentially resolve these issues. We have found substantial enhancement of the antiproliferative effect against K-562 leukemia cells of Au nanoparticles bearing 6-mercaptopurine-9-beta-d-ribofuranoside compared to the same drug in typically administered free form.

Enhanced activity and nanoparticle carriers will make possible the reduction of the overall concentration of the drug, renal clearance, and, thus, side effects.

Their action is associated with alterations of the mitotic spindle functions that prevent the cell cycle progression and lead to mitotic block. A number of studies show that some Vinca alkaloids inhibit CaM-target interaction. The newest microtubule inhibitor, vinflunine (Javlor), currently in clinical trials, is remarkably more active than vinblastine against a number of tumors. Moreover, vinflunine is significantly less toxic than other Vinca alkaloids. The high antitumor activity of this molecule is not well understood since it binds to tubulin with an overall affinity several-fold lower than that of vinblastine or vincristine. In this study, we examined the interaction of Ca2+-CaM with vinflunine, vinblastine, and stable tubule only polypeptide (STOP) by using a combination of thermodynamic and mass spectrometric approaches. We characterized the influence of Vinca alkaloids on Ca2+-CaM-STOP complex formation. Our results revealed different binding modes to Ca2+-CaM for vinflunine and vinblastine, highlighting that adding fluorine atoms on the cleavamine moiety of the Vinca alkaloid molecule is critical for the localization of the drug on calmodulin. We demonstrate that vinflunine is a better inhibitor for STOP binding to calmodulin than vinblastine. We suggest that vinflunine action on calmodulin can have an effect on microtubule dynamics. These data may contribute to a better understanding of the superior antitumor efficiency and lower toxicity of vinflunine.","['Makarov, Alexander A', 'Tsvetkov, Philipp O', 'Villard, Claude', 'Esquieu, Didier', 'Pourroy, Bertrand', 'Fahy, Jacques', 'Braguer, Diane', 'Peyrot, Vincent', 'Lafitte, Daniel']","['Makarov AA', 'Tsvetkov PO', 'Villard C', 'Esquieu D', 'Pourroy B', 'Fahy J', 'Braguer D', 'Peyrot V', 'Lafitte D']","['Engelhardt Institute of Molecular Biology, Russian Academy of Sciences, Vavilov Street 32, 119991 Moscow, Russia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071204,United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,"['0 (Calmodulin)', '0 (Peptides)', '5BF646324K (vinflunine)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Calmodulin/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Calorimetry', 'Microtubules/*drug effects/*metabolism', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Structure', 'Peptides/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Denaturation', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization', 'Temperature', 'Thermodynamics', 'Vinblastine/*analogs & derivatives/chemistry/pharmacology']",2007/12/07 09:00,2008/02/28 09:00,['2007/12/07 09:00'],"['2007/12/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/28 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/07 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/bi701803s [doi]'],ppublish,Biochemistry. 2007 Dec 25;46(51):14899-906. doi: 10.1021/bi701803s.

HLA-G exerts multiple immunoregulatory functions. Recent studies indicate an ectopic up-regulation in tumor cells that may favor their escape from anti-tumor immune responses. This study it is an effort to clarify the presence of HLA-G in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) patients. METHODS: HLA-G mRNA expression was studied in a pilot study in circulating B-CLL and also healthy controls by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR using a set of pan-HLA-G primers. RESULTS: RT-PCR was performed on B-cells from 74 B-CLL patients and 12 healthy controls. The data showed HLA-G gene expression in 20% of the B-CLL patients. No expression of HLA-G could be detected in the healthy control group. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that HLA-G is expressed at the gene level in B cells from B-CLL patients but not in B cells from healthy controls. Further study is required to clarify the role of HLA-G as a regulatory factor that could affect immune response in B-CLL patients.","['Rezvany, Mohammad Reza', 'Kazemi, Azam', 'Hajifathali, Abbas', 'Kaviani, Saeed', 'Mellstedt, Hakan']","['Rezvany MR', 'Kazemi A', 'Hajifathali A', 'Kaviani S', 'Mellstedt H']","['Dept. of Medical Laboratory Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, Semnan University of Medical Sciences, Semnan, Iran.', 'Immune and Gene Therapy Lab., Cancer Center Karolinska (CCK), Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Dept. of Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, Tarbiat Modarres University, Tehran, Iran.', 'Dept. of Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Dept. of Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, Tarbiat Modarres University, Tehran, Iran.', 'Immune and Gene Therapy Lab., Cancer Center Karolinska (CCK), Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Iran,Iran Biomed J,Iranian biomedical journal,9814853,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (HLA-G Antigens)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)']",IM,"['Aged', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'DNA Primers', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*immunology', 'HLA Antigens/*genetics', 'HLA-G Antigens', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/*immunology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/immunology', 'Reference Values', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2007/12/07 09:00,2008/01/24 09:00,['2007/12/07 09:00'],"['2007/12/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/24 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/07 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Iran Biomed J. 2007 Apr;11(2):125-129.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Human leukocyte antigen G', 'Reverse transcription PCR', 'B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia']",,,,,

We have previously shown that RAC3 is a NF-kappaB coactivator. In this paper, we investigated the role of RAC3 in cell-sensitivity to apoptosis, using H2O2 in the human embryonic kidney cell line (HEK293), and tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL) in a human chronic myeloid leukemia cell line (K562) naturally resistant to TRAIL. We observed that the tumoral K562 cells have high levels of RAC3 if compared with the non-tumoral HEK293 cells. The normal or transfected coactivator over-expression inhibits apoptosis through a diminished caspase activity and AIF nuclear translocation, increased NF-kappaB, AKT and p38, and decreased ERK activities. In contrast, inhibition of RAC3 by siRNA induced sensitivity of K562 to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Such results suggest that over-expression of RAC3 contributes to tumor development through molecular mechanisms that do not depend strictly on acetylation and/or steroid hormones, which control cell death. This could be a possible target for future tumor therapies.","['Colo, Georgina P', 'Rubio, Maria F', 'Alvarado, Cecilia V', 'Costas, Monica A']","['Colo GP', 'Rubio MF', 'Alvarado CV', 'Costas MA']","['Laboratorio de Biologia Molecular y Apoptosis, Instituto de Investigaciones Medicas Alfredo Lanari, IDIM-CONICET, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de Buenos Aires, Argentina.']",['spa'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Argentina,Medicina (B Aires),Medicina,0204271,"['0 (RAC3 protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear)', '0 (Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rac GTP-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*physiology', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Kidney/cytology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/pathology', 'Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear', 'Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/*physiology', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/*physiology', 'Transcription Factors/*physiology', 'rac GTP-Binding Proteins/*physiology']",2007/12/07 09:00,2008/09/23 09:00,['2007/12/07 09:00'],"['2007/12/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/23 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/07 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Medicina (B Aires). 2007;67(5):465-8.,El coactivador de receptores nucleares RAC3 tiene un rol protector de la apoptosis inducida por distintos estimulos.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Normally within 6 to 9 months after the end of maintenance treatment an adequate immune recovery is present. Factors such as immunity against specific antigens prior to disease (applied baseline vaccination), intensity of treatment and age can play a role in the appearance of antibodies in serum. Diphtheria (D) and Tetanus (T) antibodies are known to appear within 3 to 6 months after end of treatment as a sign of immune recovery and the reinstatement of immunological memory. A number of different questions are of interest: What differences are seen in the antibodies to D and T in children of different ages after treatment with a standardized protocol? What is the influence of post-treatment revaccination with Diphtheria/Tetanus (D/T) and treatment group on the production of D/T antibodies? PATIENTS AND METHODS: Out of 142 children and adolescents until the age of 16, treated according to the Co-ALL 05/92 protocol, 59 patients were eligible for evaluation: 31 Low-Risk (LR)- and 28 High-Risk (HR) patients. Antibodies against Diphtheria (D) and Tetanus (T) were measured 3-12 months after the end of treatment and after revaccination in case of low antibody levels against D and/or T. In patients without adequate response after repeated revaccination the cellular immunity was examined with a skin test. RESULTS: After the end of treatment, children in the low-risk (LR)-group showed more frequently adequate antibody titres against D and T than children of the high-risk (HR)-group. Antibodies against T were present in 50% of all patients. After revaccination antibodies against T were found in nearly all patients whereas for D this is only the case in some children. Patients without sufficient antibody levels mainly showed an adequate cellular immunity. CONCLUSION: In children and adolescents with ALL after therapy antibody levels of D and T are dependent on treatment intensity. Revaccination leads to an adequate immunological answer against T in most patients , which is not the case for the diphtheria vaccination. Prospective multicenter trials starting together with the ALL-treatment should be able to gain more information about the behavior of antibody levels and the risk of infection from vaccine-preventable disease in immunocompromised patients and thus lead to standardized vaccination guidelines such as immunization with conjugate vaccines already during maintenance treatment.","['Calaminus, G', 'Hense, B', 'Laws, H J', 'Groeger, M', 'MacKenzie, C R', 'Gobel, U']","['Calaminus G', 'Hense B', 'Laws HJ', 'Groeger M', 'MacKenzie CR', 'Gobel U']","['Department for Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University of Muenster.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Germany,Klin Padiatr,Klinische Padiatrie,0326144,"['0 (Antibodies, Bacterial)', '0 (Diphtheria Toxoid)', '0 (Tetanus Toxoid)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Antibodies, Bacterial/*blood', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols', 'Chi-Square Distribution', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Diphtheria/immunology/prevention & control', 'Diphtheria Toxoid/*immunology', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Cellular', '*Immunologic Memory', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*immunology', 'Risk', 'Skin Tests', 'Tetanus/immunology/prevention & control', 'Tetanus Toxoid/*immunology', 'Time Factors', 'Vaccination']",2007/12/01 09:00,2008/02/26 09:00,['2007/12/01 09:00'],"['2007/12/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/26 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/01 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1055/s-2007-990290 [doi]'],ppublish,Klin Padiatr. 2007 Nov-Dec;219(6):355-60. doi: 10.1055/s-2007-990290.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In neonates and patients with malignant disease, transient hyposplenia has been reported as well. A simple method with reliable reference values is required to determine a patient's splenic function and thereby assess the risk of systemic infection. PATIENTS: Pitted erythrocytes (pitE) were determined semi-quantitatively in patients up to 20 years of age. This included splenectomized individuals, patients at risk for hyposplenia (homozygous sickle cell anemia (HbSS), leukemia, nephroblastoma and Hodgkin's disease after irradiation, patients after stem cell transplantation (SCT)), term and preterm neonates, and 90 controls (0-20 years of age, no neonates). METHOD: A capillary blood sample was diluted in buffered glutaraldehyde. PitE were scored using differential interference contrast microscopy with Nomarski optics. RESULTS: PitE were <2% in all controls regardless of age, in splenectomized individuals >18%. In patients with HbSS, pitE scores ranged from 6.2 to 44%. Scores did not exceed 2% in patients after SCT, irradiation, or during chemotherapy for leukaemia. In term neonates, pitE were increased in the perinatal period only. The elevation in preterm neonates persisted up to 2 months after birth. CONCLUSION: Serial measurement of pitE can be used to accurately and reliably assess splenic function in children. Except for neonates, pitE are consistently <2% in healthy individuals. For clinical purposes, the degree of hyposplenia can be determined to give an estimation of the risk of severe infection, e.g. in patients with HbSS or after partial splenectomy.","['Lehmberg, K', 'Steinhausen, B', 'Janka, G']","['Lehmberg K', 'Steinhausen B', 'Janka G']","[""Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, Children's Hospital, University of Hamburg, Hamburg. k.lehmberg@uke.uni-hamburg.de""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",,Germany,Klin Padiatr,Klinische Padiatrie,0326144,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anemia, Sickle Cell/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Erythrocytes, Abnormal', 'Homozygote', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Microscopy, Interference', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Spleen/*physiology', '*Splenectomy']",2007/12/01 09:00,2008/02/26 09:00,['2007/12/01 09:00'],"['2007/12/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/26 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/01 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1055/s-2007-985889 [doi]'],ppublish,Klin Padiatr. 2007 Nov-Dec;219(6):339-42. doi: 10.1055/s-2007-985889.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS: 53 children were included in the clinical trial. The mean age was 9.6 years (0.5; 17.2 years), 10 patients died within the study period. The mean body length was normal with -0.14 SDS (-2.3; 2.5 SDS), as well as the body weight with 0.01 SDS and BMI with a mean of -0.03 SDS. Children and adolescents with different types of malignant tumors were included. According to the therapy protocol or tumor entity we divided this population in 5 subgroups (group 1 leukemia with 17 patients, group 2 lymphoma with 11 patients, group 3 tumor of CNS with 10 patients, group 4 bone and soft tissue tumors with 8 patients, group 5 different tumors with 7 patients). METHOD: Anthropometrical and laboratory parameters were analyzed in intervals of 6 months over 2 years from the time point of diagnosis. RESULTS: We found differences in body height in children affected by cerebral tumors at the time of diagnosis and therefore before any therapy was started. These patients were significantly shorter (-0.6 SDS) than the other children. The body weight increased within the first year of therapy and was still higher than normal in the second year (comparison at the time point; from start to the first year+0.5 SDS, to second year+0.4 SDS) independently from the cortisone administration. Moreover, significant differences in the growth factor concentrations between the groups and time points were identified. Interestingly, children who survived their malignant disease tended to have higher levels of IGF-I and IGFBP-3 concentration than the patients who died within the study period. Additionally, the thyroid function was affected, shown as an increase of TSH with a concomitant decrease of the free thyroxin in 91% of all patients independent from the diagnosis (start TSH 1.8, fT4 15.6, after first year TSH 2.8, fT4 15.0). Thyroid function was monitored in 12 children, in 5 patients a short- or long-term substitution with thyroid hormone was indicated. Endocrine testing was initiated in 4 children, in 2 patients affection of the adrenal gland could be excluded, a suspected pituitary dysfunction after radiation was confirmed in 2 patients. CONCLUSION: We could represent that children and adolescents with malignant diseases showed affection of the endocrine system due to the tumour and the intensive therapy. The dysregulations in the endocrine system can be diagnosed through closely spaced monitoring and interdisciplinary cooperation.","['Keller, A', 'Bierbach, U', 'Mieke, J', 'Pfaffle, R', 'Kratzsch, J', 'Kiess, W', 'Keller, E', 'Korholz, D']","['Keller A', 'Bierbach U', 'Mieke J', 'Pfaffle R', 'Kratzsch J', 'Kiess W', 'Keller E', 'Korholz D']","['Klinik und Poliklinik fur Kinder und Jugendliche, Universitat Leipzig.']",['ger'],"['Comparative Study', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",,Germany,Klin Padiatr,Klinische Padiatrie,0326144,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adrenal Glands/physiopathology', 'Anthropometry', 'Body Height', 'Body Mass Index', 'Body Weight', 'Child', 'Endocrine Glands/*physiopathology', '*Endocrinology', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Growth Disorders/etiology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/complications/drug therapy/mortality/*physiopathology/psychology', 'Pituitary Gland/physiopathology', 'Stress, Psychological/physiopathology', 'Thyroid Gland/physiopathology', 'Time Factors']",2007/12/01 09:00,2008/02/26 09:00,['2007/12/01 09:00'],"['2007/12/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/26 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/01 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1055/s-2007-971045 [doi]'],ppublish,Klin Padiatr. 2007 Nov-Dec;219(6):333-8. doi: 10.1055/s-2007-971045.,Ergebnisse einer unizentrischen endokrinologischen Nachsorge onkologischer Patienten im Kindes-und Adoleszentenalter.,,,,,,,25,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An important question in the development of novel, less toxic antileukemic strategies specifically targeting leukemia stem cells is how closely leukemia stem cells are related to normal hematopoietic stem cells. It has been recently demonstrated that leukemia stem cells can be derived from different stages in normal hematopoiesis and have unique phenotypic and genetic features. Introduction of Mixed-lineage leukemia ( MLL)-fusion oncoproteins, frequently found in infant leukemias and therapy-related leukemias, into differentiated hematopoietic progenitor cells results in the generation of leukemias with a high frequency of leukemia stem cells. The progenitor-derived leukemia stem cells ectopically express a limited stem cell program while maintaining the global identity of differentiated myeloid cells. Development of therapeutic strategies that specifically target the leukemia stem cell program while sparing normal hematopoietic stem cells may represent a novel therapeutic approach in human leukemias with high efficacy yet less side effects.","['Faber, J', 'Armstrong, S A']","['Faber J', 'Armstrong SA']","[""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Children's Hospital, Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",,Germany,Klin Padiatr,Klinische Padiatrie,0326144,"['0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Child', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/genetics/*therapy', '*Leukemia, Biphenotypic, Acute/genetics', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics', '*Neoplastic Stem Cells', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion', 'Phenotype']",2007/12/01 09:00,2008/02/26 09:00,['2007/12/01 09:00'],"['2007/12/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/26 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/01 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1055/s-2007-985878 [doi]'],ppublish,Klin Padiatr. 2007 Nov-Dec;219(6):306-11. doi: 10.1055/s-2007-985878.,,,,,,,,62,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A missense mutation in the NBS1 gene, I171V, has recently been associated with a ninefold increased risk of breast cancer in Polish patients. Positive associations have also been reported for leukaemia and larynx cancer suggesting that I171V could be a more general susceptibility factor for malignancies. We investigated the prevalence of this mutation in two large hospital-based case-control series from Germany and from the Republic of Belarus. The I171V substitution was detected in 20/1,636 Byelorussian breast cancer patients and in 18/1,014 Byelorussian controls (OR: 0.68; 95%CI: 0.36-1.30, P=0.3).

There were no significant differences between I171V carriers and non-carriers among the cases with regard to age at diagnosis, family history or bilateral occurrence of disease. A meta-analysis of all hitherto available studies did not reveal a difference in the prevalence of I171V between breast cancer cases and controls (OR: 1.05; 95%CI: 0.64-1.74, P=0.9).

Increases in the incidence of cancers and other diseases have been reported in Belarus, the Russian Federation, and Ukraine, but much of the increase appears to be due to other factors, including improvements in diagnosis, reporting, and registration. Recent findings indicate a possible doubling of leukemia risk among Chernobyl liquidators and a small increase in the incidence of premenopausal breast cancer in the very most contaminated districts. Increased risks of cardiovascular diseases and cataracts have also been reported. These findings, however, need confirmation in well-designed analytical epidemiological studies with careful individual dose reconstruction. The absence of demonstrated increases in cancer risk--apart from thyroid cancer--is not the proof that no increase has in fact occurred. Based on the experience of atomic bomb survivors, and assuming that there is a linear, no-threshold dose-response relationship between exposure to ionizing radiation and the development of cancer in humans, a small increase in the relative risk of cancer is expected, even at the low to moderate doses received. Given the large number of individuals exposed, the absolute number of cancer cases caused could be substantial, particularly in the future. It is therefore essential to continue to use population registries to monitor trends in disease morbidity and mortality in the most contaminated areas, as well as among liquidators, in order to assess the public health impact of the accident. Studies of selected populations and diseases are also essential in order to study the real effect of the accident and compare it to predictions. Careful studies may in particular provide important information on the effect of exposure rate and exposure type in the low to medium dose range and on factors that may modify radiation effects. As such, they may have important consequences for the radiation protection of patients and of the general population in case of further nuclear emergencies.","['Cardis, Elisabeth']",['Cardis E'],"['International Agency for Research on Cancer, 150 cours Albert Thomas, 69372 Lyon cedex 08, France. cardis@iarc.fr']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Health Phys,Health physics,2985093R,,IM,"['Cataract/etiology', '*Chernobyl Nuclear Accident', 'Cost of Illness', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Health Surveys', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/etiology', 'Thyroid Neoplasms/etiology']",2007/12/01 09:00,2007/12/21 09:00,['2007/12/01 09:00'],"['2007/12/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/21 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/01.HP.0000281174.30093.d6 [doi]', '00004032-200711000-00021 [pii]']",ppublish,Health Phys. 2007 Nov;93(5):542-6. doi: 10.1097/01.HP.0000281174.30093.d6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sinclair keynote address: retrospective analysis of impacts of the Chernobyl accident.,383-409,"The accident at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant in 1986 was the most severe in the history of the nuclear industry, causing a huge release of radionuclides over large areas of Europe. The recently completed Chernobyl Forum concluded that after a number of years, along with reduction of radiation levels and accumulation of humanitarian consequences, severe social and economic depression of the affected regions and associated psychological problems of the general public and the workers had become the most significant problem to be addressed by the authorities. The majority of the >600,000 emergency and recovery operation workers and five million residents of the contaminated areas in Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine received relatively minor radiation doses which are comparable with the natural background levels. An exception is a cohort of several hundred emergency workers who received high radiation doses and of whom 28 persons died in 1986 due to acute radiation sickness. Apart from the dramatic increase in thyroid cancer incidence among those exposed to radioiodine at a young age and some increase of leukemia in the most exposed workers, there is no clearly demonstrated increase in the somatic diseases due to radiation. There was, however, an increase in psychological problems among the affected population, compounded by the social disruption that followed the break-up of the Soviet Union. Despite the unprecedented scale of the Chernobyl accident, its consequences on the health of people are far less severe than those of the atomic bombings of the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Studying the consequences of the Chernobyl accident has made an invaluable scientific contribution to the development of nuclear safety, radioecology, radiation medicine and protection, and also the social sciences. The Chernobyl accident initiated the global nuclear and radiation safety regime.","['Balonov, Mikhail']",['Balonov M'],"['International Atomic Energy Agency, Vienna, Austria. m.balonov@mail.ru']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Health Phys,Health physics,2985093R,['0 (Radioactive Pollutants)'],IM,"['Agriculture', 'Animals', '*Chernobyl Nuclear Accident', 'Environmental Monitoring', 'Environmental Restoration and Remediation', 'Epidemiological Monitoring', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/epidemiology', 'Nuclear Warfare', 'Prognosis', 'Radiation Dosage', '*Radiation Protection', 'Radioactive Pollutants/analysis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Trees', 'Waste Management']",2007/12/01 09:00,2007/12/21 09:00,['2007/12/01 09:00'],"['2007/12/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/21 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/01.HP.0000282109.20364.37 [doi]', '00004032-200711000-00005 [pii]']",ppublish,Health Phys. 2007 Nov;93(5):383-409. doi: 10.1097/01.HP.0000282109.20364.37.,,,,,,,,83,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SGC-7901 and SGC-7901/ vincristine were cultured in liquid medium RMPI 1640, with the addition of vincristine to the vincristine-resistant line. The reversal effect of Shenghe Powder (using verapamil as control) on the multidrug resistance of SGC-7901/vincristine cells was observed using the 3-4,5-dimethylthiazol-2yl) -2,5-diphenylterazolium bromide method. The expression rate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), lymphoma/leukemia-2 (Bcl-2), and apoptosis ratio of SGC-7901 and SGC-7901/vincristine with added Shenghe Powder, verapamil, or verapamil plus Shenghe Powder was observed by flow cytometry. Shenghe Powder and verapamil decreased the multidrug resistance of SGC-7901/vincristine. The effect of Shenghe Powder (10 mg/L) was significantly higher than verapamil (P< .05). The intracellular concentration of vincristine was increased by Shenghe Powder and verapamil. The vincristine concentration of SGC-7901/vincristine treated with Shenghe Powder was significantly higher (P< .05). Shenghe Powder reduced the expression level of P-gp and Bcl-2 in SGC-7901/ vincristine and increased the apoptotic percentage of tumor cells; Shenghe Powder had the more significant effect on apoptosis (P< .05). In conclusion, Shenghe Powder increases the intracellular concentration of vincristine, consistent with the down-regulation of the expression of P-gp and Bcl-2.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Seventy-two patients with AML-DS were treated with remission induction chemotherapy consisting of pirarubicin (25 mg/m2/d for 2 days), cytarabine (100 mg/m2/d for 7 days), and etoposide (150 mg/m2/d for 3 days). Patients received four courses of intensification therapy of the same regimen. Prophylaxis for CNS leukemia was not included. RESULTS: All but two patients were younger than 4 years, and 67 of the 72 patients (93%) were diagnosed as acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (AMKL). Seventy of the 72 patients (97.2%) achieved a complete remission (CR), and the estimated 4-year event-free survival (EFS) rate was 83% +/- 9%. Nine patients relapsed, and one died as a result of pneumonia during CR. Multivariate analysis revealed that the presence of monosomy 7 was a greater risk factor of adverse outcome (odds ratio = 5.67; P = .027). CONCLUSION: A less intensive chemotherapeutic regimen produces excellent outcomes in standard-risk AML-DS patient.

Patients received 2 phases of induction and, if in remission, were assigned to allogeneic transplantation if they had a compatible sibling donor. Other patients were randomized to chemotherapy for 2.5 years versus an autologous transplantation. A donor versus no-donor analysis showed that Philadelphia chromosome-negative patients with a donor had a 5-year improved overall survival (OS), 53% versus 45% (P = .01), and the relapse rate was significantly lower (P < or = .001). The survival difference was significant in standard-risk patients, but not in high-risk patients with a high nonrelapse mortality rate in the high-risk donor group. Patients randomized to chemotherapy had a higher 5-year OS (46%) than those randomized to autologous transplantation (37%; P = .03). Matched related allogeneic transplantations for ALL in first complete remission provide the most potent antileukemic therapy and considerable survival benefit for standard-risk patients.

Nilotinib is a highly selective BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor. This phase 2 trial was designed to characterize the efficacy and safety of nilotinib (400 mg twice daily) in this patient population with hematologic response (HR) as primary efficacy endpoint. A total of 119 patients were enrolled and had a median duration of treatment of 202 days (range, 2-611 days). An HR was observed in 56 patients (47%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 38%-56%). Major cytogenetic response (MCyR) was observed in 35 patients (29%; 95% CI, 21%-39%). The median duration of HR has not been reached. Overall survival rate among the 119 patients after 12 months of follow-up was 79% (95% CI, 70%-87%). Nonhematologic adverse events were mostly mild to moderate. Severe peripheral edema and pleural effusions were not observed. The most common grade 3 or higher hematologic adverse events were thrombocytopenia (35%) and neutropenia (21%). Grade 3 or higher bilirubin and lipase elevations occurred in 9% and 18% of patients, respectively, resulting in treatment discontinuation in one patient.

It is desirable that feature selection provides the features that contribute most to the classification task per se and which should therefore be used by any classifier later used to produce classification rules. In this article, a conceptually simple but computer-intensive approach to this task is proposed. The reliability of the approach rests on multiple construction of a tree classifier for many training sets randomly chosen from the original sample set, where samples in each training set consist of only a fraction of all of the observed features. RESULTS: The resulting ranking of features may then be used to advantage for classification via a classifier of any type. The approach was validated using Golub et al. leukemia data and the Alizadeh et al. lymphoma data. Not surprisingly, we obtained a significantly different list of genes. Biological interpretation of the genes selected by our method showed that several of them are involved in precursors to different types of leukemia and lymphoma rather than being genes that are common to several forms of cancers, which is the case for the other methods.

We provide evidence that the Akt kinase is phosphorylated/activated during treatment of leukemia cells with As(2)O(3), to regulate downstream engagement of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and its effectors. Using cells with targeted disruption of both the Akt1 and Akt2 genes, we found that induction of arsenic trioxide-dependent apoptosis is strongly enhanced in the absence of these kinases, suggesting that Akt1/Akt2 are activated in a negative feedback regulatory manner, to control generation of As(2)O(3) responses. Consistent with this, As(2)O(3)-dependent pro-apoptotic effects are enhanced in double knock-out cells for both isoforms of the p70 S6 kinase (S6k1/S6k2), a downstream effector of Akt and mTOR. On the other hand, As(2)O(3)-dependent induction of apoptosis is diminished in cells with targeted disruption of TSC2, a negative upstream effector of mTOR. In studies using primary hematopoietic progenitors from patients with acute myeloid leukemia, we found that pharmacological inhibition of mTOR enhances the suppressive effects of arsenic trioxide on leukemic progenitor colony formation. Moreover, short interfering RNA-mediated inhibition of expression of the negative downstream effector, translational repressor 4E-BP1, partially reverses the effects of As(2)O(3). Altogether, these data provide evidence for a key regulatory role of the Akt/mTOR pathway in the generation of the effects of As(2)O(3), and suggest that targeting this signaling cascade may provide a novel therapeutic approach to enhance the anti-leukemic properties of As(2)O(3).","['Altman, Jessica K', 'Yoon, Patrick', 'Katsoulidis, Efstratios', 'Kroczynska, Barbara', 'Sassano, Antonella', 'Redig, Amanda J', 'Glaser, Heather', 'Jordan, Alison', 'Tallman, Martin S', 'Hay, Nissim', 'Platanias, Leonidas C']","['Altman JK', 'Yoon P', 'Katsoulidis E', 'Kroczynska B', 'Sassano A', 'Redig AJ', 'Glaser H', 'Jordan A', 'Tallman MS', 'Hay N', 'Platanias LC']","['Robert H.

To date, 12 FA gene products have been identified, which cooperate in a common DNA damage-activated signaling pathway regulating DNA repair (the FA pathway). Eight FA proteins form a nuclear complex harboring E3 ubiquitin ligase activity (the FA core complex) that, in response to DNA damage, mediates the monoubiquitylation of the FA protein FANCD2. Monoubiquitylated FANCD2 colocalizes in nuclear foci with proteins involved in DNA repair, including BRCA1, FANCD1/BRCA2, FANCN/PALB2 and RAD51. All these factors are required for cellular resistance to DNA crosslinking agents. The inactivation of the FA pathway has also been observed in a wide variety of human cancers and is implicated in the sensitivity of cancer cells to DNA crosslinking agents.

The diagnosis of endometrial fertility requires more precise measurements of endometrial receptivity. Interleukin (IL-11) and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) are essential for murine implantation and signal via intracellular phosphorylation (p) of STAT3 in the endometrium. Both cytokines are present in the endometrium of women duiring the receptive window. Endometrial IL-11, IL-11 receptor alpha (IL-11Ralpha), LIF and pSTAT3 in women with primary unexplained infertility was compared to normal fertile women during the implantation window. METHODS: LH timed endometrial biopsies (LH+6 to LH+10) were collected from women with unexplained infertility and normal fertility. pSTAT3, IL-11, IL-11Ralpha and LIF production was determined by immunohistochemistry. Staining intensity was determoned by two independent observers blind to the fertility status of the patient from whom the biopsy was taken. Staining intensity and heterogeneity in each of the endometrial compartments (epithelium; stroma, including decidualized stromal cells; and vasculature) was assessed. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to analyze IL-11, pSTAT3, IL-11Ralpha and LIF immunostaining intensities in the samples. RESULTS: IL-11, IL-11Ralpha and LIF were present predominantly in glandular epithelium, whilst luminal epithelium showed patchy staining. pSTAT3 was present in both glandular epithelium and stroma. IL-11 and pSTAT3 immunostaining was significantly lower in glandular epithelium in infertile women compared to controls (P < 0.05) whilst IL-11Ralpha and LIF staining did not differ. CONCLUSION: This is the first demonstration of reduced endometrial pSTAT3 and IL-11 in some women with unexplained infertility. This suggests IL-11 and pSTAT3 may be involved in the secretory transformation of glandular epithelium during receptivity. Reduced IL-11 production and STAT3 phosphorylation may contribute to unexplained infertility in some women.","['Dimitriadis, Evdokia', 'Sharkey, Andrew M', 'Tan, Yee Lee', 'Salamonsen, Lois A', 'Sherwin, J Robert A']","['Dimitriadis E', 'Sharkey AM', 'Tan YL', 'Salamonsen LA', 'Sherwin JR']","[""Prince Henry's Institute of Medical Research, P,O, Box 5152, Clayton, VIC, 3168, Australia. evdokia.dimitriadis@princehenrys.org""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071129,England,Reprod Biol Endocrinol,Reproductive biology and endocrinology : RB&E,101153627,"['0 (Interleukin-11)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-11)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)']",IM,"['Adult', '*Embryo Implantation', 'Endometrium/*metabolism', 'Epithelium/metabolism', 'Female', 'Fertility', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry/methods', 'Infertility, Female/etiology/*metabolism', 'Interleukin-11/*metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin-11/metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*metabolism', 'Staining and Labeling', 'Stromal Cells/metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Tissue Distribution']",2007/12/01 09:00,2008/03/29 09:00,['2007/12/01 09:00'],"['2007/09/14 00:00 [received]', '2007/11/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/12/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/29 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['1477-7827-5-44 [pii]', '10.1186/1477-7827-5-44 [doi]']",epublish,Reprod Biol Endocrinol. 2007 Nov 29;5:44. doi: 10.1186/1477-7827-5-44.,,,,,PMC2217553,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To aid the clinical development of dasatinib in prostate cancer, we utilized preclinical models to identify potential molecular markers for patient stratification and efficacy monitoring. RESULTS: Using gene expression profiling, we first identified 174 genes whose expression was highly correlated with in vitro sensitivity of 16 cell lines and, thus, considered as candidate efficacy predictive markers. Among these are important prostatic cell lineage markers, cytokeratin 5, androgen receptor and prostate specific antigen. Our results indicate that 'basal type' cell lines with high expression of cytokeratin 5 and low expression of androgen receptor or prostate specific antigen are sensitive to dasatinib. To identify markers as surrogates for biological activity, we treated cell lines with dasatinib and identified genes whose expression was significantly modulated by the drug. Ten genes, including that encoding urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA), were found to not only be potential efficacy markers but also to have reduced expression upon dasatinib treatment. The down-regulation of uPA by dasatinib was drug-specific and correlated with the sensitivity of cell lines to dasatinib. Furthermore, EphA2, a target of dasatinib, was found to be a sensitivity biomarker. CONCLUSION: Using the gene expression profiling approach and preclinical models, we have identified prostatic biomarkers that are associated with sensitivity to dasatinib. This study has provided a basis for clinical evaluation of a potential dasatinib efficacy signature in prostate cancer.","['Wang, Xi-De', 'Reeves, Karen', 'Luo, Feng R', 'Xu, Li-An', 'Lee, Francis', 'Clark, Edwin', 'Huang, Fei']","['Wang XD', 'Reeves K', 'Luo FR', 'Xu LA', 'Lee F', 'Clark E', 'Huang F']","['Pharmaceutical Research Institute, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Princeton, New Jersey, 08543, USA. xi-de.wang@bms.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Genome Biol,Genome biology,100960660,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dasatinib', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Monitoring, Physiologic', '*Patient Selection', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Thiazoles/*therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome']",2007/12/01 09:00,2008/08/09 09:00,['2007/12/01 09:00'],"['2007/06/15 00:00 [received]', '2007/10/22 00:00 [revised]', '2007/11/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/12/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/09 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['gb-2007-8-11-r255 [pii]', '10.1186/gb-2007-8-11-r255 [doi]']",ppublish,Genome Biol. 2007;8(11):R255. doi: 10.1186/gb-2007-8-11-r255.,,,,,PMC2258199,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We examined whether there is less selection against exonization of transposed elements in duplicated genes than in single-copy genes. RESULTS: Genome-wide analysis of exonization of transposed elements revealed a higher rate of exonization within duplicated genes relative to single-copy genes. The gene for TIF-IA, an RNA polymerase I transcription initiation factor, underwent a humanoid-specific triplication, all three copies of the gene are active transcriptionally, although only one copy retains the ability to generate the TIF-IA protein. Prior to TIF-IA triplication, an Alu element was inserted into the first intron. In one of the non-protein coding copies, this Alu is exonized. We identified a single point mutation leading to exonization in one of the gene duplicates. When this mutation was introduced into the TIF-IA coding copy, exonization was activated and the level of the protein-coding mRNA was reduced substantially. A very low level of exonization was detected in normal human cells. However, this exonization was abundant in most leukemia cell lines evaluated, although the genomic sequence is unchanged in these cancerous cells compared to normal cells. CONCLUSION: The definition of the Alu element within the TIF-IA gene as an exon is restricted to certain types of cancers; the element is not exonized in normal human cells. These results further our understanding of the delicate interplay between gene duplication and alternative splicing and of the molecular evolutionary mechanisms leading to genetic innovations. This implies the existence of purifying selection against exonization in single copy genes, with duplicate genes free from such constrains.","['Amit, Maayan', 'Sela, Noa', 'Keren, Hadas', ""Melamed, Ze'ev"", 'Muler, Inna', 'Shomron, Noam', 'Izraeli, Shai', 'Ast, Gil']","['Amit M', 'Sela N', 'Keren H', 'Melamed Z', 'Muler I', 'Shomron N', 'Izraeli S', 'Ast G']","['Department of Human Molecular Genetics and Biochemistry, Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel-Aviv University, Ramat Aviv 69978, Israel. maayana2@post.tau.ac.il']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071129,England,BMC Mol Biol,BMC molecular biology,100966983,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Co-Repressor Proteins)', '0 (DNA Transposable Elements)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (GON4L protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Pol1 Transcription Initiation Complex Proteins)', '0 (RRN3 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (YY1AP1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Alu Elements', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Line', 'Co-Repressor Proteins', 'DNA Transposable Elements/*genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Exons/*genetics', 'Genes, Duplicate/*genetics', 'Genome, Human', 'Humans', 'Introns/genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Insertional', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics', 'Pan troglodytes/genetics', 'Point Mutation/genetics', 'Pol1 Transcription Initiation Complex Proteins', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Species Specificity', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic']",2007/12/01 09:00,2008/04/04 09:00,['2007/12/01 09:00'],"['2007/06/07 00:00 [received]', '2007/11/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/12/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/04 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['1471-2199-8-109 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2199-8-109 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Mol Biol. 2007 Nov 29;8:109. doi: 10.1186/1471-2199-8-109.,,,,,PMC2231382,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the molecular mechanism underlying the sorbitol-induced apoptotic process is not yet clearly understood. In the present study, the intracellular signaling pathways of sorbitol-induced apoptosis in human K562 cells were investigated using both morphological analysis and DNA fragmentation technique. In this study, we demonstrated that sorbitol-induced apoptosis in human K562 cells is a concentration- and time-dependent manner. This sorbitol-induced apoptosis in human K562 cells was also accompanied by the up-regulation of Bax, and down-regulation of p-Bcl-2, but no effect on the levels of Bcl-X(L). Moreover, the sorbitol treatment resulted in a significant reduction of mitochondria membrane potential, increase in the release of mitochondrial cytochrome c (cyt c), and activation of caspase 3. Furthermore, treatment with caspase 3 inhibitor (z-DEVD-fmk) was capable of preventing the sorbitol-induced caspase 3 activity and cell death. These results clearly demonstrate that the induction of apoptosis by sorbitol involves multiple cellular/molecular pathways and strongly suggest that pro- and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins, mitochondrial membrane potential, mitochondrial cyt c, and caspase 3, they all participate in sorbitol-induced apoptotic process in human K562 cells.","['Marfe, Gabriella', 'Morgante, Emanuela', 'Di Stefano, Carla', 'Di Renzo, Livia', 'De Martino, Luisa', 'Iovane, Giuseppe', 'Russo, Matteo Antonio', 'Sinibaldi-Salimei, Paola']","['Marfe G', 'Morgante E', 'Di Stefano C', 'Di Renzo L', 'De Martino L', 'Iovane G', 'Russo MA', 'Sinibaldi-Salimei P']","['Department of Experimental Medicine and Biochemical Sciences, University of Rome ""Tor Vergata"", Via Montpellier 1, 00133 Rome, Italy. gabriellamarfe@libero.it']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20071129,Germany,Arch Toxicol,Archives of toxicology,0417615,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '506T60A25R (Sorbitol)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3/*biosynthesis', 'Cytochromes c/*biosynthesis', 'DNA/drug effects', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/enzymology/pathology', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/enzymology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Sorbitol/*pharmacology']",2007/11/30 09:00,2008/08/20 09:00,['2007/11/30 09:00'],"['2007/08/01 00:00 [received]', '2007/10/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/11/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/20 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/30 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00204-007-0261-y [doi]'],ppublish,Arch Toxicol. 2008 Jun;82(6):371-7. doi: 10.1007/s00204-007-0261-y.

Although drugs such as antibiotics can offer partial protection, the boys normally die in the first year of life in the absence of a curative therapy. For a third of the children, bone marrow transplantation from a fully matched donor is available and can cure the disease without major side effects. Mismatched bone marrow transplantation, however, is complicated by severe and potentially lethal side effects. Over the past decade, scientists worldwide have developed new treatments by introducing a correct copy of the IL2RG-cDNA. Gene therapy was highly effective when applied in young children. However, in a few patients the IL2RG-gene vector has unfortunately caused leukaemia. Activation of cellular proto-oncogenes by accidental integration of the gene vector has been identified as the underlying mechanism.

While autophagy is a reversible process that can be both a survival and a death pathway, apoptosis is irreversible, leading only to cell death. In this study, we followed the fate of mouse leukemia L1210 cells after photodamage to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) using a porphycene photosensitizer, where Bcl-2 was among the PDT targets. In wild-type cells, we observed a rapid wave of autophagy, presumed to represent the recycling of some damaged organelles, followed by apoptosis. Using shRNA technology, we created a Bax knockdown line (L1210/Bax(-)). In the latter cell line, we found a marked decrease in apoptosis after photodamage or pharmacologic inactivation of Bcl-2 function, but this did not affect PDT efficacy. Loss of viability was associated with a highly-vacuolated morphology consistent with autophagic cell death. Previous studies indicated pro-survival attributes of autophagy after low-dose PDT, suggesting that autophagy may be responsible for the 'shoulder' on the dose-response curve. It appears that attempts at extensive recycling of damaged organelles are associated with cell death, and that this phenomenon is amplified when apoptosis is suppressed.","['Kessel, David', 'Arroyo, Adelaida Segarra']","['Kessel D', 'Arroyo AS']","['Department of Pharmacology, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, MI 48201, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20070730,England,Photochem Photobiol Sci,Photochemical & photobiological sciences : Official journal of the European Photochemistry Association and the European Society for Photobiology,101124451,"['0 (Atg7 protein, mouse)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Photosensitizing Agents)', '0 (Porphyrins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '100572-96-1 (porphycene)', 'EC 6.2.1.45 (Autophagy-Related Protein 7)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Autophagy/*drug effects', 'Autophagy-Related Protein 7', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum/drug effects/pathology', 'Gene Deletion', 'Leukemia L1210/*drug therapy/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/metabolism', 'Photochemotherapy/*adverse effects', 'Photosensitizing Agents/pharmacology', 'Porphyrins/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*antagonists & inhibitors/deficiency/metabolism', 'Time Factors']",2007/11/30 09:00,2008/04/18 09:00,['2007/11/30 09:00'],"['2007/11/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/18 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/30 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1039/b707953b [doi]'],ppublish,Photochem Photobiol Sci. 2007 Dec;6(12):1290-5. doi: 10.1039/b707953b.

Pro- and anti-apoptotic members of the BCL2 family control many forms of apoptotic cell death, but the extent to which this survival 'rheostat' is involved in the beneficial effects of GC therapy is not understood. We performed systematic analyses of expression, GC regulation and function of BCL2 molecules in primary ALL lymphoblasts and a corresponding in vitro model. Affymetrix-based expression profiling revealed that the response included regulations of pro-apoptotic and, surprisingly, anti-apoptotic BCL2 family members, and varied among patients, but was dominated by induction of the BH3-only molecules BMF and BCL2L11/Bim and repression of PMAIP1/Noxa. Conditional lentiviral gene overexpression and knock-down by RNA interference in the CCRF-CEM model revealed that induction of Bim, and to a lesser extent that of BMF, was required and sufficient for apoptosis. Although anti-apoptotic BCL2 members were not regulated consistently by GC in the various systems, their overexpression delayed, whereas their knock-down accelerated, GC-induced cell death. Thus, the combined clinical and experimental data suggest that GCs induce both pro- and anti-apoptotic BCL2 family member-dependent pathways, with the outcome depending on cellular context and additional signals feeding into the BCL2 rheostat.","['Ploner, C', 'Rainer, J', 'Niederegger, H', 'Eduardoff, M', 'Villunger, A', 'Geley, S', 'Kofler, R']","['Ploner C', 'Rainer J', 'Niederegger H', 'Eduardoff M', 'Villunger A', 'Geley S', 'Kofler R']","['Division Molecular Pathophysiology, Department Biocenter, Medical University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071129,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BCL2L11 protein, human)', '0 (BMF protein, human)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (PMAIP1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/genetics', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/drug effects/genetics', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11', 'Child', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Glucocorticoids/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/*physiology']",2007/11/30 09:00,2008/03/28 09:00,['2007/11/30 09:00'],"['2007/11/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/28 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['2405039 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2405039 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2008 Feb;22(2):370-7. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2405039.

Ligation with corresponding ligands will determine whether the NK cell becomes activated to destroy the abnormal cell. This review will focus on the abnormalities of NK cell receptors and their putative ligands found in patients with leukemia, which can lead to an inadequate function of NK cells allowing these malignant cells to escape from NK cell destruction. In recent years it has become clear that NK cells in the haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) setting are very effective in eliminating residual acute myeloid, but not acute lymphoid, leukemic cells. In this regard, we also reviewed published studies of retrospective cohorts of HSCT investigating the potential beneficial effect of killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) ligands on NK alloreactivity.

Furthermore, the -938A/A genotype was associated with increased expression of Bcl-2. To investigate this further, we analyzed the -938 genotypes of the BCL-2 gene in 268 CLL patients and correlated data with treatment status, overall survival and known prognostic factors, for example, Binet stage, immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable (IGHV) mutational status and CD38 expression. In contrast to the recent report, the current cohort of CLL patients showed no differences either in time to treatment or overall survival in relation to usage of a particular genotype. In addition, no correlation was evident between the (-938C>A) genotypes and IGHV mutational status, Binet stage or CD38. Furthermore, the polymorphism did not appear to affect the Bcl-2 expression at the RNA level.

BAFF binds to the TNF-related receptors such as B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA), transmembrane activator and CAML interactor (TACI) and BAFFR, whereas APRIL binds to TACI and BCMA and to heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG) such as syndecan-1. TACI gene expression in myeloma reportedly can distinguish tumors with a signature of microenvironment dependence (TACI(high)) versus a plasmablastic signature (TACI(low)). We tested the effect of atacicept (formerly TACI-Ig, which blocks APRIL and BAFF) and BAFFR-Ig (which blocks BAFF only) on primary myeloma growth in the SCID-hu model and in coculture with osteoclasts. With only few exceptions, atacicept and to a lesser extent BAFFR-Ig, inhibited growth of TACI(high) but not TACI(low) myeloma samples in vivo and ex vivo, and the response rate was inversely correlated with TACI expression. Most TACI(high) myeloma cells were molecularly classified as being low risk with our recently described 70-gene model. APRIL and BAFF were highly expressed by osteoclasts and were upregulated in myeloma cells after coculture with osteoclasts. Our findings suggest that APRIL plays an essential role in the survival of TACI(high) bone marrow-dependent myeloma cells and TACI gene expression may be a useful predictive marker for patients who could benefit from atacicept treatment.","['Yaccoby, S', 'Pennisi, A', 'Li, X', 'Dillon, S R', 'Zhan, F', 'Barlogie, B', 'Shaughnessy, J D Jr']","['Yaccoby S', 'Pennisi A', 'Li X', 'Dillon SR', 'Zhan F', 'Barlogie B', 'Shaughnessy JD Jr']","['Myeloma Institute for Research and Therapy, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR 72205, USA. yaccobyshmuel@uams.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071129,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (B-Cell Activating Factor)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (TNFSF13 protein, human)', '0 (TNFSF13B protein, human)', '0 (Transmembrane Activator and CAML Interactor Protein)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor Ligand Superfamily Member 13)', 'K3D9A0ICQ3 (TACI receptor-IgG Fc fragment fusion protein)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Cell Activating Factor', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Multiple Myeloma/*drug therapy/*pathology', 'Osteoclasts/*chemistry/cytology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/*pharmacology', 'Transmembrane Activator and CAML Interactor Protein/*analysis', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Ligand Superfamily Member 13/*physiology']",2007/11/30 09:00,2008/03/28 09:00,['2007/11/30 09:00'],"['2007/11/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/28 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['2405048 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2405048 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2008 Feb;22(2):406-13. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2405048.

We made use of the Cre-loxP system to delete Pten expression in Lck- or CD4-expressing T-lineage cells. Mice initially showed modest thymic hyperplasia and subsequently developed expanding and infiltrating T-cell lymphomas, leading to a premature death within 5 to 23 weeks. Frequently, all thymocyte and peripheral T-cell populations displayed phenotypes characteristic for immature developing thymocyte precursors and shared elevated levels of clonally rearranged T-cell receptor (TCR) beta chains. In concert, CD2, CD5, CD3epsilon and CD44, proteins associated with increased expression and signaling capacity of both the immature pre-TCR and the mature alphabetaTCR, were more abundantly expressed, reflecting a constitutive state of activation. Although most T-cell lymphomas had acquired the capability to infiltrate the periphery, not all populations left the thymus and expanded clonally exclusively in the thymus. In line with this, only transplantation of thymocytes with infiltrating capacity gave rise to T-cell lymphoma in immunodeficient recipients.

However, little is known about its normal physiological function. Here we show that p53 is important in reproduction, in a gender-specific manner. Significant decreases in embryonic implantation, pregnancy rate and litter size were observed in matings with p53-/- female mice but not with p53-/- male mice. The gene encoding leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF), a cytokine critical for implantation, was identified as a p53-regulated gene that functions as the downstream mediator of this effect. p53 can regulate both basal and inducible transcription of LIF. Loss of p53 decreased both the level and function of LIF in uteri. Lower LIF levels were observed in the uteri of p53-/- mice than in those of p53+/+ mice, particularly at day 4 of pregnancy, when transiently induced high levels of LIF were crucial for embryonic implantation. This observation probably accounts for the impaired implantation of embryos in p53-/- female mice. Administration of LIF to pregnant p53-/- mice restored maternal reproduction by improving implantation. These results demonstrate a function for p53 in maternal reproduction through the regulation of LIF.

Donor T cells are also important for reconstituting immunity in the recipient. Unfortunately, donor T cells can attack nonmalignant host tissues and cause graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). We previously reported that donor CD4(+) effector memory T cells (T(EMs)) do not cause GVHD but transfer functional T-cell memory. In the present work, we demonstrate in an MHC-mismatched model that CD4(+) T(EMs) (unprimed to recipient antigens) mediate GVL against clinically relevant mouse models of chronic phase and blast crisis chronic myelogenous leukemia, without causing GVHD. By creating gene-deficient leukemias and using perforin-deficient T cells, we demonstrate that direct cytolytic function is essential for T(EM)-mediated GVL, but that GVL is retained when killing via FasL, TNF-alpha, TRAIL, and perforin is individually impaired. However, T(EM)-mediated GVL was diminished when both FasL and perforin pathways were blocked. Taken together, our studies identify T(EMs) as a clinically applicable cell therapy for promoting GVL and immune reconstitution, particularly in MHC-mismatched haploidentical alloSCTs in which T cell-depleted allografts are commonly used to minimize GVHD.","['Zheng, Hong', 'Matte-Martone, Catherine', 'Li, Hongmei', 'Anderson, Britt E', 'Venketesan, Srividhya', 'Sheng Tan, Hung', 'Jain, Dhanpat', 'McNiff, Jennifer', 'Shlomchik, Warren D']","['Zheng H', 'Matte-Martone C', 'Li H', 'Anderson BE', 'Venketesan S', 'Sheng Tan H', 'Jain D', 'McNiff J', 'Shlomchik WD']","['Penn State Milton S.

The bisphenols represent a new structural class of topoisomerase II inhibitor that potently inhibited the growth of Chinese hamster ovary and K562 leukemia cells in the low micromolar range. The fact that cell growth inhibition was significantly correlated with topoisomerase IIalpha inhibition suggests that the catalytic inhibition of topoisomerase IIalpha probably contributed to their growth inhibitory activity. Only one of the bisphenols (O3OH) tested significantly induced topoisomerase IIalpha-mediated cleavage of DNA. Most of the bisphenols displayed only low-fold cross-resistance to a K562 subline containing reduced levels of topoisomerase IIalpha Thus, it is likely that most of the bisphenols inhibited cell growth, not by acting as topoisomerase II poisons, but rather by acting as catalytic inhibitors of topoisomerase IIalpha. Three-dimensional quantitative structure-activity analysis (3D-QSAR) was carried out on the bisphenols using comparative molecular field analysis (CoMFA) and comparative molecular similarity index analysis (CoMSIA) to determine the structural features responsible for their activity. The CoMSIA analysis of the topoisomerase IIalpha inhibitory activity yielded a statistically significant model upon partial least-squares analyses. The 3D-QSAR CoMSIA analysis showed that polar meta hydrogen bond acceptor substituents on the phenyl rings favored inhibition of topoisomerase IIalpha. For the hydrogen bond donor field, para- and meta-substituted hydroxyl groups favored inhibition. Hydrophobic substituents on the bridge atoms disfavored inhibition.","['Liang, Hong', 'Wu, Xing', 'Yalowich, Jack C', 'Hasinoff, Brian B']","['Liang H', 'Wu X', 'Yalowich JC', 'Hasinoff BB']","['Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, MB R3T 2N2, Canada. b_hasinoff@umanitoba.ca']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071128,United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '5AR83PR647 (Razoxane)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*chemistry/classification', 'Antineoplastic Agents/toxicity', 'CHO Cells', 'Catalysis', 'Cricetinae', 'Cricetulus', 'DNA/metabolism', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/*chemistry/classification', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/*chemistry/classification', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Doxorubicin/toxicity', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*chemistry/pharmacology', 'Etoposide/toxicity', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Bonding', 'Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/drug therapy', 'Models, Chemical', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Structure', '*Nucleic Acid Conformation', '*Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Razoxane/chemistry', 'Static Electricity', '*Topoisomerase II Inhibitors']",2007/11/30 09:00,2008/04/09 09:00,['2007/11/30 09:00'],"['2007/11/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/09 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['mol.107.041624 [pii]', '10.1124/mol.107.041624 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 2008 Mar;73(3):686-96. doi: 10.1124/mol.107.041624.

These included a variety of low abundance transcription factors, e.g. UTF1, Sox2, Oct4, and E2F4, demonstrating a high level of proteomic penetrance. When paired comparisons of changes in the mRNA and protein expression levels were performed low levels of correlation were found. A strong correlation between isobaric tag-derived relative quantification and Western blot analysis was found for a number of nuclear proteins.

SHPS-1 binds to its ligand CD47 to relay an inhibitory signal for cellular responses, whereas SIRPbeta, an activating member of the same family, does not bind to CD47 despite sharing a highly homologous ligand-binding domain with SHPS-1. To address the molecular basis for specific CD47 recognition by SHPS-1, we present the crystal structure of the ligand-binding domain of murine SHPS-1 (mSHPS-1). Folding topology revealed that mSHPS-1 adopts an I2-set Ig fold, but its overall structure resembles IgV domains of antigen receptors, although it has an extended loop structure (C'E loop), which forms a dimer interface in the crystal. Site-directed mutagenesis studies of mSHPS-1 identified critical residues for CD47 binding including sites in the C'E loop and regions corresponding to complementarity-determining regions of antigen receptors. The structural and functional features of mSHPS-1 are consistent with the human SHPS-1 structure except that human SHPS-1 has an additional beta-strand D. These results suggest that the variable complementarity-determining region-like loop structures in the binding surface of SHPS-1 are generally required for ligand recognition in a manner similar to that of antigen receptors, which may explain the diverse ligand-binding specificities of SIRP family receptors.","['Nakaishi, Aki', 'Hirose, Mayumi', 'Yoshimura, Masato', 'Oneyama, Chitose', 'Saito, Kazunobu', 'Kuki, Nobuharu', 'Matsuda, Makoto', 'Honma, Nakayuki', 'Ohnishi, Hiroshi', 'Matozaki, Takashi', 'Okada, Masato', 'Nakagawa, Atsushi']","['Nakaishi A', 'Hirose M', 'Yoshimura M', 'Oneyama C', 'Saito K', 'Kuki N', 'Matsuda M', 'Honma N', 'Ohnishi H', 'Matozaki T', 'Okada M', 'Nakagawa A']","['Laboratory of Supramolecular Crystallography, Research Center for Structural and Functional Proteomics, Institute for Protein Research, Osaka University, Suita, Osaka 565-0871, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071107,England,J Mol Biol,Journal of molecular biology,2985088R,"['0 (CD47 Antigen)', '0 (Disulfides)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Ptpns1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (SHPS-1-Fc fusion protein)', '47E5O17Y3R (Phenylalanine)', 'K3Z4F929H6 (Lysine)', 'OF5P57N2ZX (Alanine)']",IM,"['Alanine/metabolism', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'CD47 Antigen/genetics/*metabolism', 'CHO Cells', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cricetinae', 'Cricetulus', 'Crystallography, X-Ray', 'Dimerization', 'Disulfides/chemistry', 'Escherichia coli/genetics', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Hydrogen Bonding', 'Ligands', 'Lysine/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Models, Chemical', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Molecular Weight', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/physiology', 'Phenylalanine/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Folding', 'Protein Structure, Secondary', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/chemistry/metabolism', 'Receptors, Immunologic/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Surface Plasmon Resonance', 'Transfection']",2007/11/30 09:00,2008/01/12 09:00,['2007/11/30 09:00'],"['2007/06/12 00:00 [received]', '2007/10/22 00:00 [revised]', '2007/10/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/11/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/12 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0022-2836(07)01456-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jmb.2007.10.085 [doi]']",ppublish,J Mol Biol. 2008 Jan 18;375(3):650-60. doi: 10.1016/j.jmb.2007.10.085.

In the present study, we compared the capability of alpha anomer of 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (alpha-5-azadCyd) to induce down-regulation of hTERT expression in HL-60 cells with other nucleoside analogs that act as DNA methylation inhibitors: beta-5-azadCyd (decitabine), (S)-9-(2,3-dihydroxypropyl)adenine [(S)-DHPA], isobutyl ester of (R,S)-3-(adenin-9-yl)-2-hydroxypropanoic acid [(R,S)-AHPA-ibu] and prospective DNA methylation inhibitors (S)-1-[3-hydroxy-2-(phosphonomethoxy)propyl]-5-azacytosine [(S)-HPMPazaC] and 5-fluoro-zebularine (F-PymRf). Exposure to alpha-5-azadCyd induced the down-regulation of hTERT expression in low micromolar concentrations (0.05-50 microM). A more cytotoxic beta anomer caused a transient up-regulation of hTERT and a subsequent reduction in hTERT mRNA levels at concentrations more than 10 times below its GIC50 value. In this respect, (S)-DHPA and (R,S)-AHPA-ibu were less efficient, since a similar effect was achieved at concentrations above their GIC(50). In contrast, F-PymRf treatment resulted in up to a three-fold induction of hTERT expression within a broad range of concentrations. In all cases, the down-regulation of hTERT expression was concentration-dependent. The correlation was found between c-myc overexpression and transiently elevated hTERT expression after treatment with all tested compounds except for alpha-5-azadCyd and (S)-HPMPazaC. Although the primary task of hypomethylating agents in anticancer therapy lies in reactivation of silenced tumour-suppressor genes, the inhibition of hTERT expression might also be a fruitful clinical effect of this approach.","['Hajek, Miroslav', 'Votruba, Ivan', 'Holy, Antonin', 'Krecmerova, Marcela', ""Tloust'ova, Eva""]","['Hajek M', 'Votruba I', 'Holy A', 'Krecmerova M', ""Tloust'ova E""]","['Gilead Sciences Research Center, Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry v.v.i., AS CR, 166 10 Prague 6, Czech Republic. hajek@uochb.cas.cz']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071022,England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', '7LP2MPO46S (S-Adenosylmethionine)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', '979-92-0 (S-Adenosylhomocysteine)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (TERT protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Azacitidine/*analogs & derivatives/chemistry/pharmacology', 'DNA/metabolism', 'DNA Methylation/drug effects', 'Decitabine', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Down-Regulation', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'RNA, Messenger/*biosynthesis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'S-Adenosylhomocysteine/metabolism', 'S-Adenosylmethionine/metabolism', 'Stereoisomerism', 'Telomerase/*biosynthesis']",2007/11/30 09:00,2008/04/19 09:00,['2007/11/30 09:00'],"['2007/08/29 00:00 [received]', '2007/10/11 00:00 [revised]', '2007/10/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/11/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/19 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-2952(07)00697-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bcp.2007.10.018 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2008 Feb 15;75(4):965-72. doi: 10.1016/j.bcp.2007.10.018.

However, reports of ocular involvement in such diseases as lymphomatoid granulomatosis and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia are uncommon. Here we present cases of these two relatively rare hematologic malignancies demonstrating clinical and subclinical ocular involvement. CASE PRESENTATION: In the first case, a 54-year-old man with a previous diagnosis of lymphomatoid granulomatosis presented with a new-onset conjunctival lesion while his systemic disease was thought to be in remission. A biopsy was taken that revealed heavy infiltrates of B and T cells at the site of the lesion. Molecular analysis confirmed that these cells were positive for both Epstein-Barr viral DNA and immunoglobulin heavy chain gene rearrangement, consistent with a manifestation of his systemic disease. In the second case, a 51-year-old man with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia died after a waxing and waning clinical course. Post-mortem studies revealed the presence of atypical monocytes in the choroidal and subretinal spaces, consistent with his previous diagnosis. CONCLUSION: While ocular involvement in hematologic malignancies is not uncommon, these two cases describe involvement of the eye by two relatively rare neoplasms. We herein emphasize novel findings in each case, including conjunctival involvement as the first sign of recurrent lymphomatoid granulomatosis and the combination of subretinal and choroidal myelomonocytic leukemic infiltration. With the evolution of new antineoplastic therapies that may prolong life, these cases exemplify the importance of eye care in patients diagnosed with hematologic malignancies.","['Head, James E', 'Shen, Defen', 'Santiago-Maysonet, Maribel', 'Bishop, Rachel J', 'Chan, Chi-Chao']","['Head JE', 'Shen D', 'Santiago-Maysonet M', 'Bishop RJ', 'Chan CC']","['Immunopathology Section, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA. chanc@nei.nih.gov.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20071128,England,J Med Case Rep,Journal of medical case reports,101293382,,,,2007/11/30 09:00,2007/11/30 09:01,['2007/11/30 09:00'],"['2007/06/06 00:00 [received]', '2007/11/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/11/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/11/30 09:01 [medline]', '2007/11/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['1752-1947-1-158 [pii]', '10.1186/1752-1947-1-158 [doi]']",epublish,J Med Case Rep. 2007 Nov 28;1:158. doi: 10.1186/1752-1947-1-158.,,,,,PMC2211492,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

GCs also are powerful inhibitors of the immune system, through regulation of appropriate cytokines and by causing apoptosis of immature thymocytes. By activating the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), GCs evoke apoptosis through transcriptional regulation of a complex, interactive gene network over a period of time preceding activation of the apoptotic enzymes. In this study we used microarray technology to determine whether several disparate types of hematologic cells, all sensitive to GC-evoked apoptosis, would identify a common set of regulated genes. We compared gene expression signatures after treatment with two potent synthetic GCs, dexamethasone (Dex) and cortivazol (CVZ) using a panel of hematologic cells. Pediatric CD4+/CD8+ T-cell leukemia was represented by 3 CEM clones: two sensitive, CEM-C7-14 and CEM-C1-6, and one resistant, CEM-C1-15, to Dex. CEM-C1-15 was also tested when rendered GC-sensitive by several treatments. GC-sensitive pediatric B-cell leukemia was represented by the SUP-B15 line and adult B-cell leukemia by RS4;11 cells. Kasumi-1 cells gave an example of the rare Dex-sensitive acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML). To test the generality of the correlations in malignant cell gene sets, we compared with GC effects on mouse non-transformed thymocytes. RESULTS: We identified a set of genes regulated by GCs in all GC-sensitive malignant cells. A portion of these were also regulated in the thymocytes. Because we knew that the highly Dex-resistant CEM-C1-15 cells could be killed by CVZ, we tested these cells with the latter steroid and again found that many of the same genes were now regulated as in the inherently GC-sensitive cells. The same result was obtained when we converted the Dex-resistant clone to Dex-sensitive by treatment with forskolin (FSK), to activate the adenyl cyclase/protein kinase A pathway (PKA). CONCLUSION: Our results have identified small sets of genes that correlate with GC-sensitivity in cells from several hematologic malignancies. Some of these are also regulated in normal mouse thymocytes.","['Miller, Aaron L', 'Komak, Spogmai', 'Webb, M Scott', 'Leiter, Edward H', 'Thompson, E Brad']","['Miller AL', 'Komak S', 'Webb MS', 'Leiter EH', 'Thompson EB']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, The University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, TX, USA. aamiller@utmb.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20071128,England,Cancer Cell Int,Cancer cell international,101139795,,,,2007/11/30 09:00,2007/11/30 09:01,['2007/11/30 09:00'],"['2007/09/18 00:00 [received]', '2007/11/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/11/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/11/30 09:01 [medline]', '2007/11/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['1475-2867-7-18 [pii]', '10.1186/1475-2867-7-18 [doi]']",epublish,Cancer Cell Int. 2007 Nov 28;7:18. doi: 10.1186/1475-2867-7-18.,,['R01 CA041407/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,PMC2228275,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In a mouse xenograft model, a single dose, resulting in an initial plasma antibody concentration of 5 microg/ml, which was expected to result in full target saturation, effectively inhibited human B-cell tumour development. Tumour growth resumed when plasma concentrations dropped below levels that are expected to result in half-maximal saturation. Notably, tumour load significantly impacted antibody pharmacokinetics. In monkeys, initial depletion of circulating and tissue residing B cells required relatively high-dose levels. Re-population of B-cell compartments, however, only became detectable when ofatumumab levels dropped below 10 microg/ml. We conclude that, once saturation of CD20 throughout the body has been reached by high initial dosing, plasma concentrations that maintain target saturation on circulating cells (5-10 microg/ml) are probably sufficient for sustained biological activity. These observations may provide a rationale for establishing dosing schedules for maintenance immunotherapy following initial depletion of CD20 positive (tumour) cells.","['Bleeker, Wim K', 'Munk, Martin E', 'Mackus, Wendy J M', 'van den Brakel, Jeroen H N', 'Pluyter, Marielle', 'Glennie, Martin J', 'van de Winkel, Jan G J', 'Parren, Paul W H I']","['Bleeker WK', 'Munk ME', 'Mackus WJ', 'van den Brakel JH', 'Pluyter M', 'Glennie MJ', 'van de Winkel JG', 'Parren PW']","['Genmab, Utrecht, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20071127,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antigens, CD20)', 'M95KG522R0 (ofatumumab)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies/blood', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*administration & dosage/blood/therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity', 'Antigens, CD20/*immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/*methods', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/therapy', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/therapy', 'Macaca fascicularis', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2007/11/30 09:00,2008/05/03 09:00,['2007/11/30 09:00'],"['2007/11/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/03 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['BJH6916 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2007.06916.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2008 Feb;140(3):303-12. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2007.06916.x.

We have previously reported the isolation and identification of ALV-J in commercial layer flocks from 12 farms in northern China. In this report, we further characterized this virus by in situ polymerase chain reaction (PCR) hybridization in various affected organs of chickens from six of the 12 farms. A routine method for hybridization of nucleic acid uses radioactive probe, such as a P32-labelled probe. We found that the non-radioactive digoxigenin (DIG) probe is sensitive enough to detect the nucleic acid of virus in chicken tissues. We used a pair of published primers (H5/H7) specific to the gp85 envelope gene and 3' region of pol gene of prototype ALV-J strain HPRS-103. The total RNA extracted from tumour, bone marrow, oviduct, liver and spleen of the diseased chickens from six commercial flocks, and cDNA was successfully amplified. Using the primers and cDNA, we obtained an ALV-J-specific cDNA probe of 545 bp in length by PCR. In situ PCR with H5/H7 primers was carried out in the paraffin sections from tissues of the diseased chickens, followed by in situ hybridization using the DIG-labelled cDNA probe. Positive hybridization signals were detected in the cytoplasm of paraffin sections of tumours and other organ tissues. The intensity of the signals was documented using an image analysis system measuring integral optical density (IOD). The IOD values for tissue sections treated by in situ PCR hybridization are significantly higher than that by in situ hybridization alone (P < 0.01). These data taken together suggest that in situ PCR hybridization is a more sensitive technique for detection of ALV-J in tissue sections.","['Li, N', 'Xu, B', 'Dong, W', 'Qiao, S', 'Lee, L F', 'Zhang, H M', 'Li, M', 'Du, N']","['Li N', 'Xu B', 'Dong W', 'Qiao S', 'Lee LF', 'Zhang HM', 'Li M', 'Du N']","['College of Veterinary Medicine, China Agricultural University, Beijing 100094, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Germany,J Vet Med A Physiol Pathol Clin Med,"Journal of veterinary medicine.

Differentiation is usually considered to be a one-way process of specialization as cells develop the functions of their ultimate fate and lose their immature characteristics, such as self-renewal. Progenitor cells, the products of stem cells losing the activity of self-renewal, could differentiate to mature cells, which have the feature of differentiation and lose the activity of self-renewal. The roles for cancer stem cells have been demonstrated for some cancers. However, the origin of the cancer stem cells remains elusive. METHODS: This review focuses on current scientific controversies related to the establishment of the cancer stem cells--in particular, how self-renewal and differentiation block might contribute to the evolution of cancer. RESULTS: Cancer stem cells may be caused by transforming mutations occurring in multi-potential stem cells, tissue-specific stem cells, progenitor cells, mature cells and cancer cells. Progenitor cells obtain the self-renewal activity by activating the self-renewal-associated genes rather than dedifferentiate to tissue special stem cells. The transform multi-potential stem cells gain the differentiation feature of special tissue by differentiating to cancer cells. Mature cells and cancer cells may dedifferentiate or reprogram to cancer stem cells by genetic and / or epigenetic events to gain the self-renewal activity and lose some features of differentiation. The cancer-derived stem cells are not the ""cause"", but the ""consequence"" of carcinogenesis. The genetic program controlling self-renewal and differentiation is a key unresolved issue. CONCLUSION: Cancer stem cells may be caused by disturbance of self-renewal and differentiation occurring in multi-potential stem cells, tissue-specific stem cells, progenitor cells, mature cells and cancer cells.","['Wu, Xiong-Zhi']",['Wu XZ'],"['Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, Ti-Yuan-Bei, Huan-Hu-Xi Road, He-Xi District, Tianjin 300060, China. ilwxz@163.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20071128,United States,Ann Surg Oncol,Annals of surgical oncology,9420840,['0 (Wnt Proteins)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/*physiology', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/metabolism', 'Hepatocytes/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/pathology', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/physiology', 'Multipotent Stem Cells/physiology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'Stem Cells/physiology', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Wnt Proteins/physiology']",2007/11/29 09:00,2008/03/14 09:00,['2007/11/29 09:00'],"['2007/07/31 00:00 [received]', '2007/10/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/09/24 00:00 [revised]', '2007/11/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/14 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/29 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1245/s10434-007-9695-y [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Surg Oncol. 2008 Feb;15(2):407-14. doi: 10.1245/s10434-007-9695-y.

RECENT FINDINGS: The management of chronic myeloid leukaemia has been revolutionized by targeted molecular therapy that inhibits the ABL kinase activity of the BCR-ABL gene. The achievement of a major molecular response with the first tyrosine kinase inhibitor to be introduced into clinical practice, imatinib, is a focus of therapeutic regimens. Second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors are available that have more potent effects than imatinib, and have activity against imatinib-resistant subclones. Strategies to overcome the restoration of BCR-ABL signalling and subsequent resistance to therapy include imatinib dose escalation, a more potent tyrosine kinase inhibitor, as well as non-BCR-ABL-dependent approaches and agents in clinical development.

Decreased levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 further disturb the balance between survival and pro-apoptotic mediators in chronic idiopathic neutropenia. Mutations in the HAX1 gene are associated with most cases of recessive autosomal severe congenital neutropenia, while ELA2 mutations are found in most cases of autosomal dominant and sporadic cases. The role of HAX-1 protein as a regulatory step in apoptosis provides further evidence for severe congenital neutropenia as a disorder of programmed cell death. The preleukemic character of severe congenital neutropenia, particularly for patients with need for high granulocyte colony stimulating factor dosage, was recently emphasized. SUMMARY: Chronic idiopathic (or as recent data suggest, immunologic) and severe congenital neutropenias provide intriguing models for better understanding of regulation of myelopoiesis. Similarities and differences between the two disorders might help to dissect these regulatory events.","['Palmblad, Jan', 'Papadaki, Helen A']","['Palmblad J', 'Papadaki HA']","['Departments of Medicine, Karolinska Institutet at Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge, Stockholm, Sweden. jan.palmblad@ki.se']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (HAX1 protein, human)', '0 (Proteins)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Serine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (medullasin)', 'EC 3.4.21.37 (Leukocyte Elastase)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Apoptosis', 'Bone Diseases, Metabolic/etiology', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease Susceptibility', 'Humans', 'Infections/etiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/etiology', 'Leukocyte Elastase/deficiency/genetics/physiology', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/etiology', '*Neutropenia/congenital/etiology/genetics/pathology', 'Osteoporosis/etiology', 'Proteins/genetics/physiology', 'Serine Endopeptidases/deficiency/genetics/physiology', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/immunology/pathology']",2007/11/29 09:00,2008/03/05 09:00,['2007/11/29 09:00'],"['2007/11/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/05 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/MOH.0b013e3282f172d3 [doi]', '00062752-200801000-00003 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2008 Jan;15(1):8-14. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0b013e3282f172d3.,,,,,,,,54,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has been demonstrated that AML cells express the vascular endothelial growth factors, VEGFA and VEGFC, as well as kinase insert domain-containing receptor (VEGFR2), the main receptor for downstream effects, resulting in an autocrine pathway for cell survival. This study investigates the role of the VEGFR inhibitor PTK787/ZK 222584 in leukemic cell death, and the possibility of an additional effect on cell death by a chemotherapeutic drug, amsacrine. In three AML cell lines and 33 pediatric AML patient samples, we performed total cell-kill assays to determine the percentages of cell death achieved by PTK787/ZK 222584 and/or amsacrine. Both drugs induced AML cell death. Using a response surface analysis, we could show that, in cell lines as well as in primary AML blasts, an equal magnitude of leukemic cell death could be obtained when lower doses of the more toxic amsacrine were combined with low dosages of the less toxic VEGFR inhibitor. This study shows that PTK787/ZK 222584 might have more clinical potential in AML when combined with a chemotherapeutic drug such as amsacrine. In future, it will be interesting to study whether the complications and the long-term effects of chemotherapy can be reduced by lowering the dosages of amsacrine, and by replacing it with other drugs with lower toxicity profiles, such as PTK787/ZK 222584.","['Weidenaar, Alida C', 'de Jonge, Hendrik J M', 'Fidler, Vaclav', 'ter Elst, Arja', 'Meeuwsen-de Boer, Tiny', 'Douwes, Jenny', 'Bouma-ter Steege, Jessica C A', 'Hahlen, Karel', 'Kamps, Willem A', 'de Bont, Eveline S J M']","['Weidenaar AC', 'de Jonge HJ', 'Fidler V', 'ter Elst A', 'Meeuwsen-de Boer T', 'Douwes J', 'Bouma-ter Steege JC', 'Hahlen K', 'Kamps WA', 'de Bont ES']","[""Division of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Department of Pediatrics, Beatrix Children's Hospital, and Department of Epidemiology, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Anticancer Drugs,Anti-cancer drugs,9100823,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Phthalazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '00DPD30SOY (Amsacrine)', '5DX9U76296 (vatalanib)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptors, Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor)']",IM,"['Amsacrine/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Synergism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Phthalazines/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Pyridines/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Receptors, Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2007/11/29 09:00,2008/01/24 09:00,['2007/11/29 09:00'],"['2007/11/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/24 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/CAD.0b013e3282f1be0b [doi]', '00001813-200801000-00006 [pii]']",ppublish,Anticancer Drugs. 2008 Jan;19(1):45-54. doi: 10.1097/CAD.0b013e3282f1be0b.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Receptors mediating these effects are not characterised so far. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) recognise bacterial proteins and autoantigens, which results in inflammatory reactions and influences tumour development and growth. MATERIALS AND METHODS: TLR4, 5 and 9 expressions were evaluated by immunohistology and confocal microscopy in gastric eMZBCL in comparison to other lymphomas infiltrating the stomach. RESULTS: TLR4 was exclusively expressed on the cell surface in all eMZBCL (n = 19) and not in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL, n = 12) or mantle cell lymphoma (MCL, n = 10). TLR5 was strongly expressed in CLL and weak in some eMZBCL (15 of 19), but not in MCL. TLR4, 5 and 9 were negative in all the three lymphoma entities. CONCLUSIONS: Exclusive TLR4 expression may enable eMZBCL to interact with H. pylori and autoantigens. Blockade of TLR4 might be a new approach for therapy of eMZBCL of MALT type.","['Adam, P', 'Schmausser, B', 'Gobeler-Kolve, M', 'Muller-Hermelink, H K', 'Eck, M']","['Adam P', 'Schmausser B', 'Gobeler-Kolve M', 'Muller-Hermelink HK', 'Eck M']","['Pathologisches Institut, Universitat Wurzburg, Josef-Schneider-Street 2, 97080 Wurzburg, Germany. patrick.adam@mail.uni-wuerzburg.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071127,England,Ann Oncol,Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,9007735,['0 (Toll-Like Receptor 4)'],IM,"['Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell, Marginal Zone/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Stomach Neoplasms/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Toll-Like Receptor 4/*metabolism']",2007/11/29 09:00,2008/03/13 09:00,['2007/11/29 09:00'],"['2007/11/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/13 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0923-7534(19)41168-X [pii]', '10.1093/annonc/mdm485 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Oncol. 2008 Mar;19(3):566-9. doi: 10.1093/annonc/mdm485.

Standard therapy for GVHD, high-dose steroids, results in complete responses (CRs) in 35% of patients. Because tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha) is an important effector of experimental GVHD, we treated patients with new-onset GVHD with steroids plus the TNFalpha inhibitor etanercept on a previously reported pilot trial (n = 20) and a phase 2 trial (n = 41). We compared their outcomes with those of contemporaneous patients with GVHD (n = 99) whose initial therapy was steroids alone. Groups were similar with respect to age, conditioning, donor, degree of HLA match, and severity of GVHD at onset. Patients treated with etanercept were more likely to achieve CR than were patients treated with steroids alone (69% vs 33%; P < .001). This difference was observed in HCT recipients of both related donors (79% vs 39%; P = .001) and unrelated donors (53% vs 26%; P < .001). Plasma TNFR1 levels, a biomarker for GVHD activity, were elevated at GVHD onset and decreased significantly only in patients with CR.

To investigate this question, we measured the trabecular bone volume (TBV) in iliac crest bone biopsies taken from chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients at diagnosis and again after 2 to 4 years of imatinib therapy. Half the patients (8 of 17) showed a substantive increase in TBV (> 2-fold), after imatinib therapy, with the TBV in the posttreatment biopsy typically surpassing the normal upper limit for the patient's age group. Imatinib-treated patients exhibited reduced serum calcium and phosphate levels with hypophosphatemia evident in 53% (9 of 17) of patients. In vitro, imatinib suppressed osteoblast proliferation and stimulated osteogenic gene expression and mineralized-matrix production by inhibiting PDGF receptor function. In PDGF-stimulated cultures, imatinib dose-dependently inhibited activation of Akt and Crk-L. Using pharmacologic inhibitors, inhibition of PI3-kinase/Akt activation promoted mineral formation, suggesting a possible molecular mechanism for the imatinib-mediated increase in TBV in vivo. Further investigation is required to determine whether the increase in TBV associated with imatinib therapy may represent a novel therapeutic avenue for the treatment of diseases that are characterized by generalized bone loss.","['Fitter, Stephen', 'Dewar, Andrea L', 'Kostakis, Panagiota', 'To, L Bik', 'Hughes, Timothy P', 'Roberts, Marion M', 'Lynch, Kevin', 'Vernon-Roberts, Barrie', 'Zannettino, Andrew C W']","['Fitter S', 'Dewar AL', 'Kostakis P', 'To LB', 'Hughes TP', 'Roberts MM', 'Lynch K', 'Vernon-Roberts B', 'Zannettino AC']","['Bone and Cancer Research Laboratories, and Division of Haematology, Institute of Medical and Veterinary Science (IMVS), The Hanson Institute, Adelaide, SA 5000, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071127,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Phosphates)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Platelet-Derived Growth Factor)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-crk)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Adipogenesis/drug effects/genetics', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Calcification, Physiologic/drug effects', 'Calcium/blood', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/drug effects/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Organ Size/drug effects', 'Osteogenesis/*drug effects/genetics', 'Phosphates/blood', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Platelet-Derived Growth Factor/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-crk/metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Time Factors']",2007/11/29 09:00,2008/04/16 09:00,['2007/11/29 09:00'],"['2007/11/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/16 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)51530-9 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2007-07-104281 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2008 Mar 1;111(5):2538-47. doi: 10.1182/blood-2007-07-104281.

LA (7 mg/kg per day) administered from D2.5 to D4.5 via four hourly i.p. injections plus continuous administration via miniosmotic pump resulted in complete implantation failure. To improve its pharmacokinetic properties, we conjugated LA to polyethylene glycol (PEG), achieving a significant increase in serum levels.

The disease manifests with leukaemia in greater than two thirds of patients, while the remaining patients have a lymphomatous form. According to the disease manifestations, various forms which differ in clinical course and prognosis have been recognised: acute, chronic, smouldering and lymphoma. Organomegaly, skin involvement, circulating atypical lymphocytes (""flower"" cells) with a CD4+ CD25+ phenotype and hypercalcaemia are the most common disease features. The diagnosis should be based on a constellation of clinical features and laboratory investigations. The latter comprise: lymphocyte morphology, immunophenotype, histology of the tissues affected in the pure lymphoma forms and serology or DNA analysis for HTLV-I. The differential diagnosis of ATLL includes other mature T-cell neoplasms such as T-cell prolymphocytic leukaemia (T-PLL), Sezary syndrome (SS), peripheral T-cell lymphomas and occasionally healthy carriers of the virus or Hodgkin disease. The clinical course is aggressive with a median survival of less than 12 months in the acute and lymphoma forms. Despite major advances in understanding the pathogenesis of the disease, management of these patients remains a challenge for clinicians as they do not respond or achieve only transient responses to therapies used in high-grade lymphomas. The use of antiretroviral agents such as zidovudine in combination with interferon-alpha, with or without concomitant chemotherapy, has shown activity in this disease with improvement in survival and response rate.

To date, no systematic evaluation of the limitations of surface marker-based decontamination of testicular samples with acute lymphoblastic leukemia has been performed. Here, surface markers for leukemic (CD4 and major histocompatibility complex class I) and germ cells (epithelia cell adhesion molecule) in testicular samples infiltrated with Roser's T-cell leukemia were identified. These markers were then used to delete leukemic cells and/or select for germ cells by flow cytometry (FACS). The resulting cell populations were analyzed by FACS, immunocytochemistry, or evaluation of leukemia transmission in syngeneic piebald variegated rats. Simple positive selection of germ cells or deletion of leukemic cells using specific surface markers was unable to effectively decontaminate testicular samples. The poor specificity of spermatogonial surface markers and aggregation of germ and leukemic cells limited the positive selection of germ cells, while immunophenotypic variation among lymphoblastic leukemia cells prevented adequate deletion of leukemic cells. Enzymatic treatment to disperse the testicular cells and feature of the intratesticular environment contributed to this immunophenotypic variation. Only germ cell selection in combination with leukemic cell deletion prevented leukemia transmission in association with intratesticular injection of the sorted cells. However, with such combined sorting, only 0.23% of the original testicular cells were recovered. With presently available techniques, flow cytometric purification of germ cells from a leukemic donor is not sufficiently effective or safe for clinical use.","['Hou, Mi', 'Andersson, Margareta', 'Zheng, Chengyun', 'Sundblad, Anne', 'Soder, Olle', 'Jahnukainen, Kirsi']","['Hou M', 'Andersson M', 'Zheng C', 'Sundblad A', 'Soder O', 'Jahnukainen K']","[""Department of Woman and Child Health, Astrid Lindgren Children's Hospital, Pediatric Endocrinology Unit, Q2:08, Karolinska Institutet and University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden. mi.hou@ki.se""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Reproduction,"Reproduction (Cambridge, England)",100966036,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biomarkers/analysis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', 'CD4 Antigens/analysis', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Separation/*methods', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Germ Cells/*cytology', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/analysis', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*pathology', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neoplasms, Experimental', 'Rats', 'Rats, Mutant Strains', 'Staining and Labeling']",2007/11/29 09:00,2008/04/09 09:00,['2007/11/29 09:00'],"['2007/11/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/09 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['134/6/767 [pii]', '10.1530/REP-07-0240 [doi]']",ppublish,Reproduction. 2007 Dec;134(6):767-79. doi: 10.1530/REP-07-0240.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Supportive care including transfusions and growth factors remained the mainstay of treatment for decades; however, further understanding of the biology behind these diseases led to the investigation of novel agents. As hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes, such as p15, was believed to play a key role in the pathogenesis of these diseases, hypomethylating agents were investigated. Azacitidine is one of two hypomethylating agents used in the treatment of MDS, and the first approved by US FDA. In preclinical studies, azacitidine demonstrated hypomethylating/differentiating activity with low concentration, whereas high concentration was associated with cytotoxic effects. In clinical trials, azacitidine not only improved the cytopenias associated with MDS but also delayed leukemic transformation, improved quality of life and improved overall survival in many patients so treated. Azacitidine was the first agent noted to change the natural history of the disease. Further studies are underway evaluating the role of azacitidine pre- and post-transplantation, in combination with other agents, as well as in treatment of acute myeloid leukemia patients who are not good candidates for intensive chemotherapy.

The inhibitory Smad for TGF-beta/activin signaling, Smad7, may directly or indirectly affect these signaling pathways. By modulating Smad7 expression, we attempted to delineate the relevance of Smad7 during erythro-megakaryocytic (E/M) differentiation of human erythroleukemia cells. Smad7 transcripts were detected at low levels in different erythroleukemia cell lines (TF-1, HEL and K562). Reduction of expression of endogenous Smad7 by RNA interference enhanced erythroid differentiation of K562 cells in response to physiological doses of activin-A/TGF-beta1. Stable over-expression of Smad7 in K562 cells (K562/7) prevented activation of Smad2/3 and MAPK (ERK1/2, p38 and JNK1/2) proteins by activin-A/TGF-beta1 and subsequent induction of erythroid differentiation. High levels of Smad7 also interfered with hydroxyurea- and butyrate-, but not hemin-induced erythroid differentiation. Interestingly, K562/7 cells were found to harbor a significant proportion (about 35%) of large ploy nucleated cells compared to fewer than 12% in control cells. K562/7 cells treated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), showed a great shift in ploidy towards high ploidy classes (> or =8N) accompanied with an increase in the expression of the maturation marker CD42b. We showed here that: (a) low levels of endogenous Smad7 in erythroleukemia cells are physiologically relevant, and (b) high levels of Smad7 interferes with TGF-beta/activin-induced Smad/MAPK signaling and erythro-differentiation and promotes megakaryocytic differentiation, possibly by blocking autocrine TGF-beta.","['Akel, Salem', 'Bertolette, Daniel', 'Petrow-Sadowski, Cari', 'Ruscetti, Francis W']","['Akel S', 'Bertolette D', 'Petrow-Sadowski C', 'Ruscetti FW']","['Faculty of Allied Health Sciences, Department of Medical Laboratory Sciences, Hashemite University, Zarka, Jordan. sakel@hu.edu.jo']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Platelets,Platelets,9208117,"['0 (Smad Proteins)', '0 (Smad7 Protein)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '104625-48-1 (Activins)']",IM,"['Activins/metabolism', 'Autocrine Communication', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Erythroid Cells/*cytology', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*pathology', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System', 'Megakaryocytes/*cytology', '*Signal Transduction', 'Smad Proteins/metabolism', 'Smad7 Protein/*analysis/genetics', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/metabolism']",2007/11/29 09:00,2008/03/11 09:00,['2007/11/29 09:00'],"['2007/11/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/11 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['787296757 [pii]', '10.1080/09537100701549546 [doi]']",ppublish,Platelets. 2007 Dec;18(8):566-78. doi: 10.1080/09537100701549546.,,['N01-CO-56000/CO/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: There were 23 cancers among MPH users, versus 20.4 expected (standardized morbidity ratio, SMR = 1.13, 95% confidence interval (0.72, 1.70)). Given the small number of cancers, site-specific SMR estimates were imprecise. Only one SMR was statistically significant at the p < 0.05 level, which given the number of comparisons is consistent with the absence of a true association at any site. MPH use was associated with increased risk of lymphocytic leukemia (SMR = 2.64 (1.14, 5.20)), based on eight observed cases). The medical records of these exposed cases did not reveal any lymphocytic leukemia risk factors (prior cancer, radiotherapy or chemotherapy, or Down syndrome). CONCLUSIONS: Our results are consistent with no moderate or strong association between MPH use and cancer risk in children, although our ability to examine dose and duration of use or risk at specific sites was limited by small numbers. Further study of MPH use and lymphocytic leukemia risk is needed to determine whether our results are due to chance alone.","['Oestreicher, Nina', 'Friedman, Gary D', 'Jiang, Sheng-Fang', 'Chan, Jim', 'Quesenberry, Charles Jr', 'Habel, Laurel A']","['Oestreicher N', 'Friedman GD', 'Jiang SF', 'Chan J', 'Quesenberry C Jr', 'Habel LA']","['Division of Research, Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Program, Oakland, CA 94612, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,England,Pharmacoepidemiol Drug Saf,Pharmacoepidemiology and drug safety,9208369,"['0 (Amphetamines)', '0 (Central Nervous System Stimulants)', '207ZZ9QZ49 (Methylphenidate)', '7GAQ2332NK (Pemoline)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age of Onset', 'Amphetamines/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'California/epidemiology', 'Central Nervous System Stimulants/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Clinical Pharmacy Information Systems/statistics & numerical data', 'Databases, Factual/statistics & numerical data', 'Drug Prescriptions/statistics & numerical data', 'Drug Utilization Review/methods/*statistics & numerical data', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/chemically induced/diagnosis/epidemiology', 'Methylphenidate/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Neoplasms/*chemically induced/diagnosis/epidemiology', 'Pemoline/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Risk Assessment/methods', 'SEER Program/statistics & numerical data', '*Sentinel Surveillance', 'Thyroid Neoplasms/chemically induced/diagnosis/epidemiology']",2007/11/28 09:00,2008/05/06 09:00,['2007/11/28 09:00'],"['2007/11/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/28 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pds.1519 [doi]'],ppublish,Pharmacoepidemiol Drug Saf. 2007 Dec;16(12):1268-72. doi: 10.1002/pds.1519.,,"['R01 CA098838/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA098838-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA98838/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['Pharmacoepidemiol Drug Saf. 2007 Dec;16(12):1273-4.

These tumors most commonly occur in the stomach and small intestine and encompass a clinical spectrum from benign to malignant. In the current study, the authors examined long-term follow-up data of 1892 GIST patients from the U.S. BACKGROUND: Nine patients (2 with gastric GISTs and 7 with GISTs of the small intestine) developed myeloid leukemia. There were 6 patients (4 women and 2 men) with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), including 1 case of promyelocytic and 1 case of myelomonocytic leukemia, and 3 patients (2 men and 1 woman) with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). RESULTS: The leukemias developed 1.7 to 21 years after the GIST (median interval, 6 years). None of the GIST patients had received radiotherapy or chemotherapy prior to the leukemia diagnosis. Eight of 9 patients died of leukemia, and none died of GIST. All but 1 GIST case was found to have a low mitotic rate (0-1 per 50 high-power fields); however, tumor size varied from 3 to 18 cm (median, 4.5 cm). Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) and their 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated comparing the incidences of AML/CMLs in GIST patients with those in the 2000 through 2003 U.S. population. In GIST patients, the risk of AML was found to be significantly higher for women (SIR of 5.14; 95% CI, 1.34-11.4) and overall (SIR of 2.96; 95% CI, 1.07-5.8). There was a slightly increased risk for CML, but this was not statistically significant (SIR of 3.71; 95% CI, 0.7-9.1). CONCLUSIONS: Additional epidemiologic, clinical, and pathogenetic studies are needed to understand the apparent nonrandom association between GIST and myeloid leukemia.","['Miettinen, Markku', 'Kraszewska, Ewa', 'Sobin, Leslie H', 'Lasota, Jerzy']","['Miettinen M', 'Kraszewska E', 'Sobin LH', 'Lasota J']","['Department of Soft Tissue Pathology, Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, Washington, DC 20306-6000, USA. miettinen@afip.osd.mil']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Data Interpretation, Statistical', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors/*epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Intestinal Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*epidemiology', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Factors', 'Stomach Neoplasms/*epidemiology']",2007/11/28 09:00,2008/03/14 09:00,['2007/11/28 09:00'],"['2007/11/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/14 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/28 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.23216 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2008 Feb 1;112(3):645-9. doi: 10.1002/cncr.23216.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

VIP down-regulates the innate immune response by inhibiting the release of proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and nitric oxide by activated macrophages, microglia, and dendritic cells. VIP affects the adaptive immune response by reducing the costimulatory capacity of antigen-presenting cells, and by preferentially inducing Th(2)-type responses. This is accomplished through preferential Th(2) differentiation, enhanced survival of Th(2) effectors, and the induction of Th(2)-attracting chemokines. Recently, we discovered a novel mechanism for the immunosuppressive effect of VIP that involves the generation of antigen-specific regulatory T cells (Treg) through the induction of tolerogenic dendritic cells (tDC). In this work, we review the VIP-induced Treg generation both in vivo and in vitro, and the use of VIP-generated Treg in two models of autoimmunity, i.e., collagen-induced arthritis and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, and in bone marrow transplantation as related to graft-versus-host disease and the graft-versus-leukemia response.","['Ganea, Doina', 'Gonzalez-Rey, Elena', 'Delgado, Mario']","['Ganea D', 'Gonzalez-Rey E', 'Delgado M']","['Department of Physiology, Temple University School of Medicine, 3420 N.

For example, the enumeration of mutations in immunoglobulin genes is important for the prognosis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and this requires the accurate identification of the germline genes from which a particular sequence is derived. The immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable (IGHV) gene repertoire is generally considered to be highly polymorphic. In this report, we describe a bioinformatic analysis of germline and rearranged immunoglobulin gene sequences which casts doubt on the existence of a substantial proportion of reported germline polymorphisms. We report a five-level classification system for IGHV genes, which indicates the likelihood that the genes have been reported accurately. The classification scheme also reflects the likelihood that germline genes could be incorrectly identified in mutated VDJ rearrangements, because of similarities to other alleles. Of the 226 IGHV alleles that have previously been reported, our analysis suggests that 104 of these alleles almost certainly include sequence errors, and should be removed from the available repertoire. The analysis also highlights the presence of common mismatches, with respect to the germline, in many rearranged heavy-chain sequences, suggesting the existence of twelve previously unreported alleles. Sequencing of IGHV genes from six individuals in this study confirmed the existence of three of these alleles, which we designate IGHV3-49*04, IGHV3-49*05 and IGHV4-39*07. We therefore present a revised repertoire of expressed IGHV genes, which should substantially improve the accuracy of immunoglobulin gene analysis.","['Wang, Yan', 'Jackson, Katherine J L', 'Sewell, William A', 'Collins, Andrew M']","['Wang Y', 'Jackson KJ', 'Sewell WA', 'Collins AM']","['School of Biotechnology and Biomolecular Sciences, University of New South Wales, Kensington, New South Wales, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071127,United States,Immunol Cell Biol,Immunology and cell biology,8706300,['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)'],IM,"['Alleles', 'Computational Biology', 'Databases, Genetic/standards', '*Gene Rearrangement/genetics', '*Genes, Immunoglobulin Heavy Chain', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Analysis']",2007/11/28 09:00,2008/05/23 09:00,['2007/11/28 09:00'],"['2007/11/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/23 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['7100144 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.icb.7100144 [doi]']",ppublish,Immunol Cell Biol. 2008 Feb;86(2):111-5. doi: 10.1038/sj.icb.7100144.

Between November 1996 and May 2002, 2078 children and adolescents with newly diagnosed ALL (1 to 9 years old with white blood count 50 000/mm3 or more, or 10 years of age or older with any white blood count) were enrolled. After induction, 1299 patients with marrow blasts less than or equal to 25% on day 7 of induction (rapid early responders) were randomized to standard or longer duration (n = 651 + 648) and standard or increased intensity (n = 649 + 650) PII. Stronger intensity PII improved event-free survival (81% vs 72%, P < .001) and survival (89% vs 83%, P = .003) at 5 years. Differences were most apparent after 2 years from diagnosis. Longer duration PII provided no benefit. Stronger intensity but not prolonged duration PII improved outcome for patients with higher-risk ALL.

Prophylaxis for herpes virus and Pneumocystis carinii is standard with this agent. Approximately 20% to 25% of patients will experience cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation. We conducted a randomized trial wherein patients being treated with an alemtuzumab-containing regimen received prophylaxis with either valaciclovir 500 mg orally daily or valganciclovir 450 mg orally twice daily. The study design planned to enroll 128 patients, but stopping rules for early termination were met. Forty patients were evaluable. Median age was 58 years (range, 25-83 years); median number of prior therapies was 2 (range, 0-10). Diagnoses included chronic lymphocytic leukemia (29), T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia (3), hairy cell leukemia (1), adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) (1), marginal zone leukemia (1), large granular lymphocyte leukemia (2), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (1), and T-cell lymphoma (2). Patients received various alemtuzumab-containing regimens, including single agent (5) or combined with: rituximab (2), pentostatin (6), fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab (23), or fractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, adriamycin, and dexamethasone (hyper-CVAD) (4). Seven of 20 patients enrolled on the valaciclovir arm experienced CMV reactivation. None of the 20 patients randomized to valganciclovir experienced CMV reactivation (P = .004).

Despite the role of PML in many cellular functions, little is known about the regulation of PML itself. We show that PML stability is regulated through interaction with the peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase Pin1. This interaction is mediated through four serine-proline motifs in the C terminus of PML. Binding to Pin1 results in degradation of PML in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. Furthermore, our data indicate that sumoylation of PML blocks the interaction, thus preventing degradation of PML by this pathway. Functionally, we show that in the MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line modulating levels of Pin1 affects steady-state levels of PML. Furthermore, degradation of PML due to Pin1 acts both to protect these cells from hydrogen peroxide-induced death and to increase the rate of proliferation. Taken together, our work defines a novel mechanism by which sumoylation of PML prevents Pin1-dependent degradation. This interaction likely occurs in numerous cell lines and may be a pathway for oncogenic transformation.","['Reineke, Erin L', 'Lam, Minh', 'Liu, Qing', 'Liu, Yu', 'Stanya, Kristopher J', 'Chang, Kun-Sang', 'Means, Anthony R', 'Kao, Hung-Ying']","['Reineke EL', 'Lam M', 'Liu Q', 'Liu Y', 'Stanya KJ', 'Chang KS', 'Means AR', 'Kao HY']","['Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University, 10900 Euclid Avenue, Cleveland, OH 44106, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071126,United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (NIMA-Interacting Peptidylprolyl Isomerase)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Small Ubiquitin-Related Modifier Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'EC 5.2.1.8 (PIN1 protein, human)', 'EC 5.2.1.8 (Peptidylprolyl Isomerase)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Motifs', 'Breast Neoplasms/etiology/*pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Female', 'Humans', 'NIMA-Interacting Peptidylprolyl Isomerase', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Peptidylprolyl Isomerase/*metabolism', 'Phenotype', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Binding', 'Small Ubiquitin-Related Modifier Proteins/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*metabolism']",2007/11/28 09:00,2008/03/18 09:00,['2007/11/28 09:00'],"['2007/11/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/18 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['MCB.01848-07 [pii]', '10.1128/MCB.01848-07 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2008 Feb;28(3):997-1006. doi: 10.1128/MCB.01848-07.

Members of the myeloid translocation gene (MTG) family of transcriptional corepressors are frequently disrupted by chromosomal translocations in acute myeloid leukemia, whereas MTG16 may be inactivated in up to 40% of breast cancer and MTG8 is a candidate cancer gene in colorectal carcinoma. Genetic studies imply that this corepressor family may function in stem cells. Given that mice lacking Myeloid Translocation Gene Related-1 (Mtgr1) fail to maintain the secretory lineage in the small intestine, we surveyed transcription factors that might recruit Mtgr1 in intestinal stem cells or progenitor cells and found that MTG family members associate specifically with TCF4. Coexpression of beta-catenin disrupted the association between these corepressors and TCF4. Furthermore, when expressed in Xenopus embryos, MTG family members inhibited axis formation and impaired the ability of beta-catenin and XLef-1 to induce axis duplication, indicating that MTG family members act downstream of beta-catenin. Moreover, we found that c-Myc, a transcriptional target of the Wnt pathway, was overexpressed in the small intestines of mice lacking Mtgr1, thus linking inactivation of Mtgr1 to the activation of a potent oncogene.","['Moore, Amy C', 'Amann, Joseph M', 'Williams, Christopher S', 'Tahinci, Emilios', 'Farmer, Tiffany E', 'Martinez, J Andres', 'Yang, Genyan', 'Luce, K Scott', 'Lee, Ethan', 'Hiebert, Scott W']","['Moore AC', 'Amann JM', 'Williams CS', 'Tahinci E', 'Farmer TE', 'Martinez JA', 'Yang G', 'Luce KS', 'Lee E', 'Hiebert SW']","['Department of Biochemistry, 512 Preston Research Building, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, 2220 Pierce Ave., Nashville, TN 37232, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20071126,United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (CBFA2T2 myeloid-transforming gene-related protein)', '0 (Cbfa2t3 protein, mouse)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (RUNX1T1 protein, human)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (TCF Transcription Factors)', '0 (TCF7L2 protein, human)', '0 (Tcf7l2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factor 7-Like 2 Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Xenopus Proteins)', '0 (beta Catenin)', '0 (tcf7l2 protein, Xenopus)']",IM,"['Animals', 'COS Cells', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Cricetinae', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Intestine, Small/chemistry', 'K562 Cells', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism/*physiology', 'Protein Binding', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/analysis', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Repressor Proteins/*genetics', 'TCF Transcription Factors/genetics/*physiology', 'Transcription Factor 7-Like 2 Protein', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection', 'Xenopus Proteins', 'beta Catenin/*metabolism']",2007/11/28 09:00,2008/03/18 09:00,['2007/11/28 09:00'],"['2007/11/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/18 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['MCB.01242-07 [pii]', '10.1128/MCB.01242-07 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2008 Feb;28(3):977-87. doi: 10.1128/MCB.01242-07.

Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) and all-trans retinoic acid (RA) induce monocytic differentiation of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) cells in a synergistic manner. We used the promoter of DIF2, a gene involved in monocytic differentiation, to model the mechanism underlying the cooperative induction of target genes by RA and TNFalpha. We show a functional RA response element in the DIF2 promoter, which is constitutively bound by PML/RARalpha in APL cells. RA stimulates release of corepressors and recruitment of chromatin modifying proteins and additional transcription factors to the promoter, but these changes cause only a modest induction of DIF2 mRNA. Co-stimulation with RA plus TNFalpha facilitates binding of NF-kappaB to the promoter, which is crucial for full induction of transcription. Furthermore, RA plus TNFalpha greatly enhanced the level of RNA Pol II phosphorylation on the DIF2 promoter, via synergistic recruitment of TFIIH. We propose that RA mediates remodeling of chromatin to facilitate binding of transcription factors, which cooperate to enhance Pol II phosphorylation, providing a mechanism whereby nuclear receptors interact with other signaling pathways on the level of transcription.","['Witcher, Michael', 'Pettersson, Filippa', 'Dupere-Richer, Daphne', 'Padovani, Alessandra', 'Summers-Deluca, Leslie', 'Baldwin, Albert S', 'Miller, Wilson H Jr']","['Witcher M', 'Pettersson F', 'Dupere-Richer D', 'Padovani A', 'Summers-Deluca L', 'Baldwin AS', 'Miller WH Jr']","['Lady Davis Institute for Medical Research, Segal Cancer Centre of the SMBD Jewish General Hospital, McGill University, Montreal H3T1E2, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20071126,England,Nucleic Acids Res,Nucleic acids research,0411011,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Chromatin)', '0 (IER3 protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Transcription Factor RelA)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '148710-81-0 (Transcription Factor TFIIH)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (RNA Polymerase II)']",IM,"['Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/*genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Chromatin/drug effects', '*Chromatin Assembly and Disassembly', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Membrane Proteins/*genetics', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA Polymerase II/metabolism', 'Response Elements', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transcription Factor RelA/metabolism', 'Transcription Factor TFIIH/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', '*Transcriptional Activation', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*pharmacology', 'U937 Cells']",2007/11/28 09:00,2008/03/18 09:00,['2007/11/28 09:00'],"['2007/11/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/18 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['gkm1058 [pii]', '10.1093/nar/gkm1058 [doi]']",ppublish,Nucleic Acids Res. 2008 Feb;36(2):435-43. doi: 10.1093/nar/gkm1058.

GM-CSF also has been shown to induce the differentiation of myeloid dendritic cells (DCs) that promote the development of T-helper type 1 (cellular) immune responses in cognate T cells. This review summarizes some of the immunological effects of GM-CSF relevant to antitumor immunity in cancer patients. GM-CSF has been used to augment the activity of rituximab in patients with follicular lymphoma and to induce autologous antitumor immunity in patients with hormone-refractory prostate cancer. GM-CSF causes upregulation of costimulatory molecule expression on leukemia blasts in vitro, enhancing their ability to present antigen to allogeneic T cells, and, in combination with interferon-alpha, can induce antitumor immune responses in patients whose acute leukemia has relapsed following allogeneic hematopoietic progenitor cell transplant. Tumor cells engineered to secrete GM-CSF are particularly effective as antitumor vaccines, and the addition of GM-CSF to standard vaccines may increase their effectiveness by recruiting DCs to the site of vaccination. However, a significant limitation in the use of GM-CSF as an immunostimulatory agent is that objective antitumor responses are infrequent, and are often not durable. Effective and durable antitumor immunity will likely require novel methods to eliminate counterregulatory immune responses that limit activation and expansion of cytotoxic T cells with antitumor activity.","['Waller, Edmund K']",['Waller EK'],"['Bone Marrow and Stem Cell Transplant Center, Winship Cancer Institute, Emory University, 1365-C Clifton Road NE, Atlanta, Georgia 30322, USA. ewaller@emory.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Oncologist,The oncologist,9607837,"['0 (Immunologic Factors)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '5TAA004E22 (sargramostim)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Factors/*therapeutic use', '*Immunotherapy', 'Neoplasms/*therapy', 'Recombinant Proteins']",2007/12/13 09:00,2008/01/11 09:00,['2007/12/13 09:00'],"['2007/12/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/11 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['12/suppl_2/22 [pii]', '10.1634/theoncologist.12-S2-22 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncologist. 2007;12 Suppl 2:22-6. doi: 10.1634/theoncologist.12-S2-22.,,,,,,,,34,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Delineation and clarification of prognostic factors have led to improved risk determination, with research moving from cytogenetics to an examination of molecular markers. Trends in the area of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation include broad adoption of reduced-intensity conditioning despite the lack of prospective comparative studies. Although the preponderance of data has established this as a feasible option, a true understanding of how much of an advantage it conveys needs to be established in prospective studies. The use of alternative donors is another advance, and recent data are promising, but survival is poor if transplantation is performed when disease is active, especially during refractory relapse or refractory disease. When haploidentical matched donors are used, survival rates appear similar to those reported with matched unrelated-donor transplants. Analysis of the data for allogeneic transplantation shows that HLA-identical sibling transplants to patients in the first complete remission (CR1) provide the highest probability of long-term survival, compared with HLA-identical sibling transplants to patients in later remissions. Similarly, unrelated-donor transplants to high-risk patients in CR1 lead to a greater degree of success than unrelated-donor transplants to patients in CR2 or later remission. Cord blood has also been established as a suitable source for hematopoietic transplantation in AML. A third area of recent progress involves new and targeted therapies.

Recombinant cytokines, such as recombinant human (rh)GM-CSF and interferon (IFN)-gamma, have been explored to augment host antifungal immune responses. These cytokines promote activation and recruitment of granulocyte and mononuclear phagocytic effector cells. Prophylaxis with rhGM-CSF was associated with significantly fewer life-threatening and serious (grade > or =3) infections, especially in older patients undergoing treatment for AML. The limited experience with rhGM-CSF for the treatment of invasive fungal infections in combination with antifungal drug(s) was associated with a favorable outcome, and in contrast to Escherichia coli-derived rhGM-CSF, the new preparation (sargramostim) was well tolerated and rarely associated with serious systemic toxicities. Similarly, IFN-gamma has been successfully used in patients with antimicrobial drug-refractory and/or disseminated fungal infection. Most patients tolerate the T-helper type 1 protagonist cytokine without serious adverse events. In difficult-to-treat fungal infections, the addition of cytokines appears to improve outcome and may be considered early in severely immunosuppressed patients with AML.","['Safdar, Amar']",['Safdar A'],"['Department of Infectious Diseases, Infection Control, and Employee Health, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030, USA. asafdar@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Oncologist,The oncologist,9607837,['0 (Antifungal Agents)'],IM,"['Antifungal Agents/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*microbiology', 'Mycoses/*therapy']",2007/12/13 09:00,2008/01/11 09:00,['2007/12/13 09:00'],"['2007/12/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/11 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['12/suppl_2/2 [pii]', '10.1634/theoncologist.12-S2-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncologist. 2007;12 Suppl 2:2-6. doi: 10.1634/theoncologist.12-S2-2.,,,,,,,,23,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Diagnosis is done on characteristic cytological pattern of the bone marrow aspiration and/or biopsy. We report two observations. The first patient, aged 75, has been hospitalized for fever, asthenia and lower back pain. An haematological malignancy was suspected after observation of a few peripheral blood blast cells, but necrosis was found on the bone marrow aspiration and could not lead to further haematological diagnosis. Within next days, the white blood cell count and the number of blasts increased, leading to the diagnosis of acute monoblastic leukaemia. A chemotherapy was started but the patient died 20 days after admission. The second patient, aged 28, has been hospitalized for severe bleeding a few days after the diagnosis of a metastatic gastric tumour. The bone marrow aspiration, made for the evaluation of a thrombocytopenia, showed a massive necrosis. The patient deceased shortly after hospitalization. According to literature, bone marrow necrosis is in most instances secondary to either an haematological malignancy (60%) or to a solid tumour (30%), but only at times observed with a non-malignant disorder. Bone pain, fever, cytopenias and elevated serum lactic dehydrogenase and alkaline phosphatase are frequently reported, but are mostly non specific of the diagnosis in these malignant conditions. Examination of the bone marrow leads to the diagnosis: cells are pycnotic, scarcely recognizable in a background of amorphous extracellular eosinophilic proteinaceous material, and histology shows disappearance of fat spaces with preservation of the bone tissue. Tissue hypoxemia due to microcirculation failure may be the main mechanism leading to the necrosis, whatever the related disorder. Supportive care together with specific therapy of the causal disease must be started promptly. The prognosis depends on the underlying illness and is generally very poor when extensive necrosis is observed.","['Gerard, J', 'Berdin, B', 'Portier, G', 'Godon, A', 'Tessier-Marteau, A', 'Genevieve, F', 'Zandecki, M']","['Gerard J', 'Berdin B', 'Portier G', 'Godon A', 'Tessier-Marteau A', 'Genevieve F', 'Zandecki M']","[""Laboratoire d'hematologie biologique, Centre hospitalo-universitaire, Angers.

Methods K562 cells (5x10(4)/ml) were harvested at mid-exponential phase and planted in 96 well plates with 100 microl each and in 50 ml culture bottles, 1.5 ml each. The cells were treated for 48 hours with different concentration of Toxoplasma tachyzoites. Growth inhibition rate was measured with MTT method. Apoptosis was detected through following ways: fluorescence microscopy with Hoechst 33 258 staining was used for observing the change of cell morphology, agarose electrophoresis was used to detect the DNA changes and FCM was used to observe sub-diploid. RESULTS: Toxoplasma can inhibit proliferation of K562 cells. K562 cells treated with Toxoplasma presented an inhibition rate of 17%, 28%, 48%, 50% and 55% under the tachyzoite concentration of lxl0(4), 2x10(4), 4x 10(4), 8x10(4) and 16xl0(4)/ml respectively, with a significant difference to the control (t=3.606, 5.918, P<0.05; t=9.171, 7.841 and 7.067, P<0.01). Cell contraction and apoptotic bodies were observed under fluorescence microscope. DNA fragment was shown through agarose electrophoresis. Flow cytometric analysis showed an apoptosis peak at 48h. The apoptosis rate was 5.53%, 7.12%, 10.34%, 21.14% and 29.68% respectively.

We report here aberrant expression of PR domain containing 16 (PRDM16) in AML cells with either translocations of 1p36 or normal karyotype. These carried, respectively, relatively high prevalence of mutations in the TP53 tumor suppressor gene and in the nucleophosmin (NPM) gene, which regulates p53. Two protein isoforms are expressed from PRDM16, which differ in the presence or absence of the PR domain. Overexpression of the short isoform, sPRDM16, in mouse bone marrow induced AML with full penetrance, but only in the absence of p53. The mouse leukemias were characterized by multilineage cellular abnormalities and megakaryocyte dysplasia, a common feature of human AMLs with 1p36 translocations or NPM mutations. Overexpression of sPRDM16 increased the pool of HSCs in vivo, and in vitro blocked myeloid differentiation and prolonged progenitor life span. Loss of p53 augmented the effects of sPRDM16 on stem cell number and induced immortalization of progenitors. Thus, overexpression of sPRDM16 induces abnormal growth of stem cells and progenitors and cooperates with disruption of the p53 pathway in the induction of myeloid leukemia.","['Shing, Danielle C', 'Trubia, Maurizio', 'Marchesi, Francesco', 'Radaelli, Enrico', 'Belloni, Elena', 'Tapinassi, Cinzia', 'Scanziani, Eugenio', 'Mecucci, Cristina', 'Crescenzi, Barbara', 'Lahortiga, Idoya', 'Odero, Maria D', 'Zardo, Giuseppe', 'Gruszka, Alicja', 'Minucci, Saverio', 'Di Fiore, Pier Paolo', 'Pelicci, Pier Giuseppe']","['Shing DC', 'Trubia M', 'Marchesi F', 'Radaelli E', 'Belloni E', 'Tapinassi C', 'Scanziani E', 'Mecucci C', 'Crescenzi B', 'Lahortiga I', 'Odero MD', 'Zardo G', 'Gruszka A', 'Minucci S', 'Di Fiore PP', 'Pelicci PG']","['Department of Experimental Oncology, European Institute of Oncology, Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (PRDM16 protein, human)', '0 (Prdm16 protein, mouse)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Cellular Senescence/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Protein Isoforms/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic', '*Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics']",2007/11/27 09:00,2008/02/13 09:00,['2007/11/27 09:00'],"['2007/04/12 00:00 [received]', '2007/09/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/11/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/13 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/27 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1172/JCI32390 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Invest. 2007 Dec;117(12):3696-707. doi: 10.1172/JCI32390.,,,,,PMC2082144,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This translocation can be found as the sole cytogenetic abnormality in acute lymphoblastic leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia and in malignant lymphomas. The expression of CALM/AF10 in primary murine bone marrow cells results in the development of an aggressive leukemia in a murine bone marrow transplantation model. Using a yeast two-hybrid screen, we identified the lymphoid regulator Ikaros as an AF10 interacting protein. Interestingly, Ikaros is required for normal development of lymphocytes, and aberrant expression of Ikaros has been found in leukemia. In a murine model, the expression of a dominant negative isoform of Ikaros causes leukemias and lymphomas. The Ikaros interaction domain of AF10 was mapped to the leucine zipper domain of AF10, which is required for malignant transformation both by the CALM/AF10 and the MLL/AF10 fusion proteins. The interaction between AF10 and Ikaros was confirmed by GST pull down and co-immunoprecipitation. Coexpression of CALM/AF10 but not of AF10 alters the subcellular localization of Ikaros in murine fibroblasts. The transcriptional repressor activity of Ikaros is reduced by AF10. These results suggest that CALM/AF10 might interfere with normal Ikaros function, and thereby block lymphoid differentiation in CALM/AF10 positive leukemias.","['Greif, P A', 'Tizazu, B', 'Krause, A', 'Kremmer, E', 'Bohlander, S K']","['Greif PA', 'Tizazu B', 'Krause A', 'Kremmer E', 'Bohlander SK']","['Medizinische Klinik III, Klinikum der LMU Munchen-Grosshadern & Klinische Kooperationsgruppe Leukamie am Hamatologikum der GSF, Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071126,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (AF10-CALM fusion protein, human)', '0 (IKZF1 protein, human)', '0 (MLLT10 protein, human)', '0 (Monomeric Clathrin Assembly Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (PICALM protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '148971-36-2 (Ikaros Transcription Factor)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Humans', 'Ikaros Transcription Factor/biosynthesis/*metabolism/physiology', 'Leukemia/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphocytes/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Monomeric Clathrin Assembly Proteins/genetics/physiology', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/*physiology', 'Subcellular Fractions/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/physiology']",2007/11/27 09:00,2008/05/29 09:00,['2007/11/27 09:00'],"['2007/11/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/29 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['1210945 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.onc.1210945 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2008 May 1;27(20):2886-96. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1210945.

This research, which involved the collection of a considerable amount of epidemiological data in the field, focused on epidemiological determinants (mother to child transmission, genetic susceptibility/resistance) of the human oncogenic retrovirus human T cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1). Data were collected from a specific population (Noirs Marrons) living in remote areas in French Guiana (South America). This ethnic group of African descent is highly endemic for HTLV-1 and associated adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma. The population has lived for two centuries on either side of the Maroni river, which constitutes the frontier between French Guiana and Surinam. The low socioeconomic and education levels of a large part of this population are mainly explained by a recent housing/residence fixation on the French side of the Maroni river. It is also linked to significant immigration from Surinam due to the civil war, which lasted for five years in the late 1990s, in this country. Conducting epidemiological surveys in this peculiar context illustrates the limitations of the available current legal framework in France for such studies. Indeed, several important ethical issues arose concerning not only individual and population benefits, but also specificities of the given information and of the informed consent. Another question concerns individual information feed-back in such a context of persistent viral infection, with a very low disease incidence, in a population with a relatively low education level. The goal of this work was mainly to report several of the ethical issues encountered and to discuss possible ways of achieving better information deliver and consent procedures in such a context. Indeed, these procedures should include new ideas and regulations promoting a real partnership, in order to conduct long-term epidemiological studies in populations with a low education level.","['Tortevoye, P', 'Moutel, G', 'Tuppin, P', 'Plancoulaine, S', 'Joubert, M', 'Herve, C', 'Gessain, A']","['Tortevoye P', 'Moutel G', 'Tuppin P', 'Plancoulaine S', 'Joubert M', 'Herve C', 'Gessain A']","[""Unite d'Epidemiologie et Physiopathologie des Virus Oncogenes, URA CNRS 3015, Departement de Virologie, Institut Pasteur, Paris Cedex 15, France.""]",['fre'],['Journal Article'],20071126,France,Rev Epidemiol Sante Publique,Revue d'epidemiologie et de sante publique,7608039,,IM,"['Community Participation/legislation & jurisprudence', 'Educational Status', '*Epidemiologic Studies', '*Ethical Analysis', '*Ethics, Research', 'Ethnicity/statistics & numerical data', 'France', 'French Guiana/epidemiology/ethnology', 'HTLV-I Infections/*epidemiology/ethnology', 'Health Promotion/ethics/legislation & jurisprudence', 'Humans', 'Informed Consent/ethics/legislation & jurisprudence', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/epidemiology/ethnology', 'Poverty']",2007/11/27 09:00,2008/05/31 09:00,['2007/11/27 09:00'],"['2006/12/22 00:00 [received]', '2007/09/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/11/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/31 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0398-7620(07)00280-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.respe.2007.09.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Rev Epidemiol Sante Publique. 2007 Dec;55(6):413-21. doi: 10.1016/j.respe.2007.09.002.

Clofarabine, a newly approved drug for pediatric leukemia, is a second-generation purine nucleoside analogue that can block DNA synthesis and inhibit DNA repair. Therefore, we hypothesized that clofarabine could work synergistically with radiotherapy to increase the tumor cell response. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The effects of clofarabine on radiosensitivity have been established in several tumor cell lines in vitro and in vivo using colony-forming assays and tumor xenografts. The effect of clofarabine on the DNA damage response was also studied in vitro by measuring gamma-H2AX focus formation. RESULTS: Clonogenic survival was significantly reduced in irradiated cells treated with clofarabine, demonstrating the strong radiosensitizing effect of clofarabine. Furthermore, clofarabine displayed a radiosensitizing effect that was greater than gemcitabine or 5-fluorouracil. We also found that low doses of clofarabine can prolong the presence of radiation-induced gamma-H2AX nuclear focus formation, and high doses of clofarabine can induce DNA double-strand breaks, suggesting that clofarabine can interfere with DNA damage response pathways. In addition, clofarabine-induced radiosensitization was also established in vivo using a colorectal cancer model, DLD-1, in athymic nude mice. When combined with fractionated radiotherapy, a moderate dose of clofarabine led to a significant increase in tumor growth inhibition. CONCLUSION: Clofarabine acts as a powerful radiosensitizer both in vitro and in vivo by interfering with the DNA damage response.","['Cariveau, Mickael J', 'Stackhouse, Murray', 'Cui, Xiao-Li', 'Tiwari, Kamal', 'Waud, William', 'Secrist, John A 3rd', 'Xu, Bo']","['Cariveau MJ', 'Stackhouse M', 'Cui XL', 'Tiwari K', 'Waud W', 'Secrist JA 3rd', 'Xu B']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Southern Research Institute, Birmingham, AL 35205, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071126,United States,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",7603616,"['0 (Adenine Nucleotides)', '0 (Arabinonucleosides)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (H2AX protein, human)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Radiation-Sensitizing Agents)', '762RDY0Y2H (Clofarabine)']",IM,"['Adenine Nucleotides/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Arabinonucleosides/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Clofarabine', '*DNA Damage', 'DNA Repair/*drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/drug effects/radiation effects', 'HeLa Cells', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Radiation Tolerance/*drug effects', 'Radiation-Sensitizing Agents/*pharmacology', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2007/11/27 09:00,2008/02/08 09:00,['2007/11/27 09:00'],"['2007/06/15 00:00 [received]', '2007/09/10 00:00 [revised]', '2007/09/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/11/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/08 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0360-3016(07)04206-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.ijrobp.2007.09.012 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2008 Jan 1;70(1):213-20. doi: 10.1016/j.ijrobp.2007.09.012.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 1997 and 2001, 180 men with clinical stage T1c-T3cN0M0 adenocarcinoma of the prostate were registered. Fifteen were found to be ineligible and the institutional MR radiologist could not assess the TV in 32, leaving 133 for analysis. Multivariable Cox regression analysis was used to assess whether a significant association existed between eMRI-defined TV progression during nAST and time to recurrence adjusting for prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, Gleason score (8 to 10 or 7 vs. 6 or less) and stage (T3 vs. T1-2). RESULTS: After a median follow up of 6.7 years and adjusting for known prognostic factors, there was a significant increase in the risk of PSA failure (HR, 2.3 [95% CI, 1.1-4.5; p = 0.025) in men with eMRI-defined TV progression during nAST. Specifically, adjusted estimates of PSA failure were significantly higher (p = 0.032) in men with, compared with men without, eMRI-defined TV progression reaching 38% vs. 19%, respectively, by 5 years.

To establish whether the loss of p15(Ink4b) contributes to AML progression in association with RUNX1-ETO, we have expressed the RUNX1-ETO fusion protein from a retroviral vector in hematopoietic progenitor cells isolated from wild-type, p15(Ink4b) or p16(Ink4a) knockout bone marrow. Analysis of lethally irradiated recipient mice reconstituted with RUNX1-ETO-expressing cells showed that neither p15(Ink4b) or p16(Ink4a) loss significantly accelerated disease progression over the time period of one year post-transplantation. Loss of p15(Ink4b) alone resulted in increased myeloid progenitor cell frequencies in bone marrow by 10-month post-transplant and a 19-fold increase in the frequency of Lin(-)c-Kit(+)Sca-1(+) (LKS) cells that was not associated with expansion of long-term reconstituting HSC. These results strongly suggest that p15(Ink4b) loss must be accompanied by additional oncogenic changes for RUNX1-ETO-associated AML to develop.","['Ko, Rose M', 'Kim, Hyung-Gyoon', 'Wolff, Linda', 'Klug, Christopher A']","['Ko RM', 'Kim HG', 'Wolff L', 'Klug CA']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, The University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL 35294, United States.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20071126,England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Runx1 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation/*physiology', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*physiology', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15/genetics/*physiology', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16/genetics/*physiology', 'DNA Primers', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/pathology/*physiopathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL']",2007/11/27 09:00,2008/08/06 09:00,['2007/11/27 09:00'],"['2007/08/28 00:00 [received]', '2007/10/10 00:00 [revised]', '2007/10/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/11/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0145-2126(07)00404-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2007.10.012 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2008 Jul;32(7):1101-11. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2007.10.012.

Mutant viruses capable of growing in EC cells can be isolated. They have genomic alterations within the viral enhancer, which is required for viral gene expression and DNA replication. This viral regulatory region was considered as a potential probe for mouse cell differentiation. The 24-bp-long A element within the enhancer was identified as a minimum element, which also shows a lower activity in EC cells compared with the differentiated cells. Transcription factors PEA1/AP1, PEA2/PEBP2, and PEA3/ETS were identified as A element-binding proteins. All of them are absent in EC cells and induced to be expressed when the cells are differentiated. Although PEBP2 has a weaker transactivation activity compared with other two, it is essential for the enhancer function of the A element. Purification and cDNA cloning revealed that PEBP2 has two subunits, DNA-binding alpha (PEBP2alpha) and non-DNA-binding beta (PEBP2beta). PEBP2alpha was found to be highly homologous to a Drosophila segmentation gene, runt, and a human gene AML1 that was identified as a part of the fusion gene, AML1/ETO (MTG8) generated by t(8;21) chromosome translocation associated with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). Core-binding factor (CBF), which interacts with a murine retrovirus enhancer, was found to be identical to PEBP2. runt, PEBP2alpha and AML1 are now termed RUNX family, which are involved in cell specification during development. There are three mammalian RUNX genes, RUNX1, RUNX2, and RUNX3. RUNX1 is essential for generation of hematopoietic stem cells and is involved in human leukemia. RUNX2 is essential for skeletal development and has an oncogenic potential. RUNX3 is expressed in wider ranges of tissues and has multiple roles. Among others, RUNX3 is a major tumor suppressor of gastric and many other solid tumors.","['Ito, Yoshiaki']",['Ito Y'],"['Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology, 61 Biopolis Drive, Proteos, Singapore 138673, Singapore.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Adv Cancer Res,Advances in cancer research,0370416,['0 (Core Binding Factor alpha Subunits)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Core Binding Factor alpha Subunits/*genetics', '*Embryonal Carcinoma Stem Cells', 'Evolution, Molecular', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics', 'Mutation', 'Oncogenes', 'Polyomavirus', 'Rabbits']",2007/11/27 09:00,2008/02/26 09:00,['2007/11/27 09:00'],"['2007/11/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/26 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0065-230X(07)99002-8 [pii]', '10.1016/S0065-230X(07)99002-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Adv Cancer Res. 2008;99:33-76. doi: 10.1016/S0065-230X(07)99002-8.,,,,,,,,150,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Due to its poor stability and the reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by its decomposition, chemical modification of HA 14-1 is needed for its future development. We have synthesized a stabilized analog of HA 14-1--sHA 14-1, which did not induce the formation of ROS. As expected from a putative antagonist against anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins like HA 14-1, sHA 14-1 disrupted the binding interaction of a Bak BH3 peptide with Bcl-2 or Bcl-X(L) protein, inhibited the growth of tumor cells through the induction of apoptosis, and circumvented the drug resistance induced by the over-expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and Bcl-X(L) proteins. Interestingly, the impairment of extrinsic apoptotic pathway induced moderate resistance to sHA 14-1. The moderate resistance suggested that sHA 14-1 generated part of its apoptotic stress through the intrinsic pathway, possibly through its antagonism against anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins. The resistance indicated that sHA 14-1 generated apoptotic stress through the extrinsic apoptotic pathway as well. The ability of sHA 14-1 to induce apoptotic stress through both pathways was further supported by the synergism of sHA 14-1 towards the cytotoxicities of Fas ligand and dexamethasone in Jurkat cells. Taken together, these findings suggest that sHA 14-1 may represent a promising candidate for the treatment of drug-resistant cancers either as a monotherapy or in combination with current cancer therapies.","['Tian, Defeng', 'Das, Sonia G', 'Doshi, Jignesh M', 'Peng, Jun', 'Lin, Jialing', 'Xing, Chengguo']","['Tian D', 'Das SG', 'Doshi JM', 'Peng J', 'Lin J', 'Xing C']","['Department of Medicinal Chemistry, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071126,Ireland,Cancer Lett,Cancer letters,7600053,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Bax protein (53-86))', '0 (Benzopyrans)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '0 (ethyl', '2-amino-6-bromo-4-(1-cyano-2-ethoxy-2-oxoethyl)-4H-chromene-3-carboxylate)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Benzopyrans/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Stability', 'Drug Synergism', 'Fas Ligand Protein/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Nitriles/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Peptide Fragments/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Transfection', 'bcl-X Protein/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism']",2007/11/27 09:00,2008/03/14 09:00,['2007/11/27 09:00'],"['2007/08/23 00:00 [received]', '2007/10/08 00:00 [revised]', '2007/10/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/11/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/14 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0304-3835(07)00480-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.canlet.2007.10.012 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Lett. 2008 Feb 8;259(2):198-208. doi: 10.1016/j.canlet.2007.10.012.

We report on two point mutations of the D4-guanine diphosphate (GDP)-dissociation inhibitor (GDI) gene, one of the Rho-GDIs, which were found in a human leukemic cell line, Reh, and the mutated D4-GDI functions as an accelerator of leukemic cell invasion. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We investigated the altered activity of GDP dissociation by mutated (mt) D4-GDI and the functions of this mt and wild-type (wt) D4-GDI in invasion. The mice inoculated with wt or mt D4-GDI vector-transfected Raji cells were observed and examined pathologically. Adhesiveness and cell motility of wt or mt D4-GDI vector-transfected Raji cells were examined. Finally, it was examined whether Rho activation was changed by mutation of D4-GDI under the condition of Rho-GDI knockdown. RESULTS: Two point mutations of the D4-GDI gene were found in Reh cells. The region of mutations is conserved among members of the Rho-GDI family at the amino acid level. D4-GDI with two mutations (V68L and V69A) functioned in a dominant negative manner in the inhibition of GDP dissociation from Rho. Severe combined immune-deficient mice inoculated with Raji cells developed hemiparalysis. The Raji cells were present in bone marrow and peripheral blood, and hepatic invasion was observed in 20% of the mice. Mice inoculated with wt D4-GDI vector-transfected Raji cells (wt D4) showed later paralysis and none developed hepatic invasion. Mice inoculated with mt D4-GDI-transfected Raji cells (mt D4) showed a 5-day reduction in the time to paraplegia and death. In addition, hepatic invasion was evident in 80% of mice transplanted with mt D4 cells. There were no differences in growth rates and amounts of guanine triphosphate (GTP)-bound Rho, cdc42, or Rac among all clones, however, GTP-bound Rho in mt D4 clone with short hairpin RNA (shRNA) vector for Rho-GDI knockdown was increased compared with wt D4 clone with shRNA vector for Rho-GDI knockdown. The mt D4 cells showed an augmentation of adhesiveness and cell motility. On the other hand, wt D4 cells showed a decreased ability of cell motility. CONCLUSION: These results suggest the mutated D4-GDI functions as a dominant negative molecule against the wt D4-GDI and accelerates invasion via regulation of cytoskeletal machinery.","['Nakata, Yuji', 'Kondoh, Kensuke', 'Fukushima, Sachiko', 'Hashiguchi, Akinori', 'Du, Wenlin', 'Hayashi, Mutsumi', 'Fujimoto, Jun-ichiroh', 'Hata, Jun-ichi', 'Yamada, Taketo']","['Nakata Y', 'Kondoh K', 'Fukushima S', 'Hashiguchi A', 'Du W', 'Hayashi M', 'Fujimoto J', 'Hata J', 'Yamada T']","['Department of Pathology, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071126,Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (ARHGDIB protein, human)', '0 (Guanine Nucleotide Dissociation Inhibitors)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (rho Guanine Nucleotide Dissociation Inhibitor beta)', '0 (rho-Specific Guanine Nucleotide Dissociation Inhibitors)', '146-91-8 (Guanosine Diphosphate)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rho GTP-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', '*Amino Acid Substitution', 'Animals', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/pathology', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Line, Tumor/metabolism', 'Cell Movement', 'Child', 'Conserved Sequence', 'Female', 'Genes, Dominant', 'Guanine Nucleotide Dissociation Inhibitors/*genetics/physiology', 'Guanosine Diphosphate/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Mutation, Missense', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness/*physiopathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics/physiology', 'Paresis/etiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*pathology', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*genetics/physiology', 'rho GTP-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'rho Guanine Nucleotide Dissociation Inhibitor beta', 'rho-Specific Guanine Nucleotide Dissociation Inhibitors']",2007/11/27 09:00,2008/03/05 09:00,['2007/11/27 09:00'],"['2006/12/20 00:00 [received]', '2007/07/23 00:00 [revised]', '2007/08/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/11/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/05 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-472X(07)00532-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2007.08.023 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2008 Jan;36(1):37-50. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2007.08.023.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the molecular mechanisms involved in glucocorticoid-mediated inhibition of primary human neutrophil apoptosis. METHODS: Primary human neutrophils were isolated from peripheral blood of healthy volunteers and cultured in vitro with dexamethasone. RESULTS: Here we confirm that dexamethasone, a classical glucocorticoid, significantly inhibited apoptosis of primary human neutrophils. This inhibition was not dependent on transrepression of proapoptotic molecules but was associated with induction of antiapoptotic Mcl-1. Remarkably, glucocorticoid-mediated enhancement of Mcl-1 and survival were significantly suppressed by pharmacologic inhibition of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase or phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. Inhibition of the above kinases also blocked glucocorticoid-induced maintenance of mitochondrial transmembrane potential and suppression of caspases. CONCLUSION: Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase are protein kinases that regulate the prosurvival effect of glucocorticoids on human neutrophils.","['Saffar, Arash S', 'Dragon, Stephane', 'Ezzati, Peyman', 'Shan, Lianyu', 'Gounni, Abdelilah Soussi']","['Saffar AS', 'Dragon S', 'Ezzati P', 'Shan L', 'Gounni AS']","['Department of Immunology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071126,United States,J Allergy Clin Immunol,The Journal of allergy and clinical immunology,1275002,"['0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein)', '0 (XIAP protein, human)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dexamethasone/antagonists & inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Glucocorticoids/antagonists & inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Neutrophils/*physiology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*metabolism', 'Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'Up-Regulation', 'X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein/metabolism', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism']",2007/11/27 09:00,2008/03/20 09:00,['2007/11/27 09:00'],"['2006/12/20 00:00 [received]', '2007/09/27 00:00 [revised]', '2007/10/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/11/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/20 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0091-6749(07)01856-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jaci.2007.10.003 [doi]']",ppublish,J Allergy Clin Immunol. 2008 Feb;121(2):492-498.e10. doi: 10.1016/j.jaci.2007.10.003.

Therefore, we evaluated the effect six different statins on TNF-induced NF-kappaB activation in human myeloid leukemia cells. We then determined whether the combination of statins and standard chemotherapeutic agents could overcome chemoresistance and augment apoptosis. Of the six statins evaluated, only the natural statins (simvastatin, mevastatin, lovastatin, and pravastatin), not the synthetic statins (fluvastatin and atorvastatin), inhibited TNF-induced NF-kappaB activation. Simvastatin suppressed the NF-kappaB activation and potentiated the apoptosis induced by doxorubicin, paclitaxel, and 5-fluorouracil. These results suggest that different statins behave differently from one another and that they may be useful in overcoming chemoresistance.","['Ahn, Kwang Seok', 'Sethi, Gautam', 'Aggarwal, Bharat B']","['Ahn KS', 'Sethi G', 'Aggarwal BB']","['Cytokine Research Laboratory, Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, United States.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071016,England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors)', '0 (NF-kappa B)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Down-Regulation', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'NF-kappa B/*antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",2007/11/27 09:00,2008/04/19 09:00,['2007/11/27 09:00'],"['2007/08/08 00:00 [received]', '2007/09/25 00:00 [revised]', '2007/10/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/11/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/19 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-2952(07)00689-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bcp.2007.10.010 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2008 Feb 15;75(4):907-13. doi: 10.1016/j.bcp.2007.10.010.

METHODS: TaqMan-MGB probe was constructed. Peripheral blood samples were collected from 374 MPD patients, 76 with polycythemia vera (PV), 38 with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), and 115 with essential thrombocythemia (ET), and 19 with idiopathic myelofibrosis (IMF). Peripheral blood samples from 65 patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), 30 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, 8 patients with chronic lymphoblastic leukemia, and 7 patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and 16 cases of normal donor bone marrow were used as controls. Genomic DNA or RNA was extracted and reversely transcrtibed into cDNA. TaqMan-MGB probe was used to detect the JAK2V617F mutant in MPD. Furthermore, 168 specimens underwent allele specific PCR and 8 specimens underwent sequencing. This method was used on both DNA and cDNA specimens from 38 MPD patients simultaneously so as to test the consistency. RESULTS: The JAK2V617F mutation rates of the PV, ET, and IMF patients were 53 (70%), 59 (51%), (58%) respectively. JAK2V617F mutation was found in only one of the 65 AML patients and was not identified in other control specimens. Both the results of allele specific PCR and of sequencing were consistent with the result of TaqMan-MGB probe method. CONCLUSION: JAK2V617F mutation is widespread in Chinese MPD patients. Real-time quantitative PCR with TaqMan MGB probe can be used for rapid and accurate detection of the JAK2V617F mutation.","['Ruan, Guo-rui', 'Chen, Shan-shan', 'Li, Ling-di', 'Liu, Yan-rong', 'Qin, Ya-zhen', 'Li, Jin-lan', 'Ma, Xi', 'Wang, Feng-rong', 'Jiang, Qian', 'Jiang, Bin', 'Liu, Kai-yan', 'Huang, Xiao-jun']","['Ruan GR', 'Chen SS', 'Li LD', 'Liu YR', 'Qin YZ', 'Li JL', 'Ma X', 'Wang FR', 'Jiang Q', 'Jiang B', 'Liu KY', 'Huang XJ']","[""Peking University Institute of Hematology and People's Hospital, Beijing 100044, China.""]",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,China,Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua yi xue za zhi,7511141,"['0 (DNA Probes)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA Mutational Analysis/methods', 'DNA Probes/genetics', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Mutation', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Reproducibility of Results']",2007/11/27 09:00,2008/07/01 09:00,['2007/11/27 09:00'],"['2007/11/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/01 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/27 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi. 2007 Sep 11;87(34):2401-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The expression of 14-3-3sigma is frequently altered in cancers of epithelial origin associated with altered DNA methylation. Since its involvement in a non-epithelial tumor is unknown, we examined 14-3-3sigma expression in patients with haematological malignancies. METHODS: We analyzed 41 hematopoietic cell lines and 129 patients with a variety of hematological malignancies for 14-3-3sigma expression with real-time RT-PCR. We also examined protein levels by Western blot analysis and DNA methylation status of the 14-3-3sigma gene by methylation-specific PCR analysis of bisulfite-treated DNA. In addition, mutations of p53 gene were identified by RT-PCR-SSCP analysis and the expression levels of 14-3-3sigma were compared with those of other cell-cycle inhibitor genes, CDKN2A and ARF. RESULTS: The expression levels of 14-3-3sigma mRNA in almost all cell lines were low and comparable to those in normal hematopoietic cells except for 2 B-cell lines. On the contrary, 14-3-3sigma mRNA was aberrantly overexpressed frequently in mature lymphoid malignancies (30 of 93, 32.3%) and rarely in acute leukemia (3 of 35, 8.6%). 14-3-3sigma protein was readily detectable and roughly reflected the mRNA level. In contrast to epithelial tumors, methylation status of the 14-3-3sigma gene was not associated with expression in hematological malignancies. Mutations of p53 were identified in 12 patients and associated with lower expression of 14-3-3sigma. The expression levels of 14-3-3sigma, CDKN2A and ARF were not correlated with but rather reciprocal to one another, suggesting that simultaneous overexpression of any two of them is incompatible with tumor growth. CONCLUSION: 14-3-3sigma, an epithelial cell marker, was overexpressed significantly in a subset of mature lymphoid malignancies. This is the first report of aberrant 14-3-3sigma expression in non-epithelial tumors in vivo. Since the significance of 14-3-3sigma overexpression is unknown even in epithelial tumors such as pancreatic cancers, further analysis of regulation and function of the 14-3-3sigma gene in non-epithelial as well as epithelial tumors is warranted.","['Motokura, Toru', 'Nakamura, Yukari', 'Sato, Hiroyuki']","['Motokura T', 'Nakamura Y', 'Sato H']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Faculty of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan. motokura@grape.med.tottori-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071125,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,"['0 (14-3-3 Proteins)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 3.1.- (Exonucleases)', 'EC 3.1.- (Exoribonucleases)', 'EC 3.1.- (SFN protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ADP-Ribosylation Factors)']",IM,"['14-3-3 Proteins', 'ADP-Ribosylation Factors/genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Cycle', 'DNA Methylation', 'Exonucleases/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Exoribonucleases', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Genes, p16', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics', 'Up-Regulation']",2007/11/27 09:00,2008/03/25 09:00,['2007/11/27 09:00'],"['2007/06/26 00:00 [received]', '2007/11/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/11/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/25 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['1471-2407-7-217 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2407-7-217 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2007 Nov 25;7:217. doi: 10.1186/1471-2407-7-217.,,,,,PMC2222637,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, reports of brucella infections in immunocompromised hosts are relatively rare. CASE PRESENTATIONS: Reported here are two patients with acute leukemia who developed Brucella melitensis bacteremia during their follow up at the Armed Forces Hospital in Riyadh. The first patient developed B. melitensis bacteremia during the transformation of his myelodysplasia into acute myeloid leukemia. The second patient developed B. melitensis bacteremia while his acute lymphoblastic leukemia was under control. Interestingly, he presented with acute cholecystitis during the brucella sepsis. Both brucella infections were associated with a marked reduction in the hematological parameters in addition to other complications. The bacteremic episodes were successfully treated with netilmicin, doxycycline and ciprofloxacin. CONCLUSION: Brucellosis can cause systemic infections, complicated bacteremia and serious morbidity in patients with acute leukemia living in endemic areas. These infections may occur at the presentation of the leukemia or even when the leukemia is in remission. Nevertheless, the early diagnosis of brucellosis and the administration of appropriate antimicrobial therapy for sufficient duration usually improves the outcome in these immunocompromised patients.","['Al-Anazi, Khalid Ahmed', 'Al-Jasser, Asma Marzouq']","['Al-Anazi KA', 'Al-Jasser AM']","['Section of Adult Hematology and Hematopoietic, Stem Cell Transplant, King Faisal Cancer Centre, King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre, PO Box 3345, Riyadh 11211, Saudi Arabia. kaa_alanazi@yahoo.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20071123,England,J Med Case Rep,Journal of medical case reports,101293382,,,,2007/11/27 09:00,2007/11/27 09:01,['2007/11/27 09:00'],"['2007/07/24 00:00 [received]', '2007/11/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/11/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/11/27 09:01 [medline]', '2007/11/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['1752-1947-1-144 [pii]', '10.1186/1752-1947-1-144 [doi]']",epublish,J Med Case Rep. 2007 Nov 23;1:144. doi: 10.1186/1752-1947-1-144.,,,,,PMC2174500,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It shows a remarkable heterogeneity, with some patients having an almost normal lifespan, others surviving only several years after diagnosis despite intensive therapy. To prospectively explore the prognostic significance of ATM and TP53 deletions in Chinese patients with CLL, interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and probes of LSI ATM and LSI p53 were used to detect ATM and TP53 deletions in 95 patients with CLL. ATM and TP53 deletions and their association with some other prognostic factors such as Binet stage, lymphocyte count in peripheral blood, serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), beta2-microglobulin (beta2-MG), CD38 and ZAP-70 expressions were analyzed. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to construct survival curves, and results were compared using the log-rank test. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were used to assess associations between survival time and potential risk factors. Out of the 95 patients with CLL, ATM gene deletion was found in 9 (9.5%) patients, TP53 gene deletion in 16 (16.8%) cases. There were no significant differences between ATM or TP53 deletion and clinical parameters of sex, age, Binet stage, lymphocyte count, LDH, beta2-MG or ZAP-70 expression. However, the frequency of ATM and TP53 deletions were obviously higher in CD38-positive group than in CD38-negative group (P=0.001 and P=0.047, respectively). Among 41 patients received treatment with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide, there were nine patients with TP53 or ATM deletion, and no patient with these cytogenetic abnormalities achieved complete response (CR). Survival analysis showed that the patients with TP53 deletion had significantly shorter survival times than the patients without TP53 deletion. There was no evidence of important association between outcome and ATM gene deletion. Serum levels of LDH and beta2-MG, CD38 expression, and TP53 deletion were the significant factors in determining overall survival (OS). TP53 deletion and CD38 expression were the variables strongly associated with OS by multivariate Cox regression analysis. It was showed that ATM or TP53 deletion is associated with high expression level of CD38 and TP53 deletion as a possible prognostic factor in Chinese patients with CLL.","['Xu, Wei', 'Li, Jian-Yong', 'Wu, Yu-Jie', 'Yu, Hui', 'Shen, Qiu-Dan', 'Li, Li', 'Fan, Lei', 'Qiu, Hong-Xia']","['Xu W', 'Li JY', 'Wu YJ', 'Yu H', 'Shen QD', 'Li L', 'Fan L', 'Qiu HX']","['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, 300 Guangzhou Road, Nanjing 210029, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071126,England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (ATM protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/*genetics', 'China', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Female', '*Gene Deletion', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*genetics', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*genetics', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*genetics']",2007/11/24 09:00,2008/08/06 09:00,['2007/11/24 09:00'],"['2007/10/11 00:00 [received]', '2007/10/11 00:00 [revised]', '2007/10/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/11/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0145-2126(07)00403-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2007.10.009 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2008 Jul;32(7):1071-7. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2007.10.009.

In some particular settings (i.e. Sjogren's syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis), the activated B cells could undergo malignant clonal expansion. Chronic infections by lymphotropic viruses (hepatitis C virus, Epstein Barr Virus, Herpes 6 and 8 viruses) could amplify the activation process by inducing antiapoptotic signals that lead to a longer survival of B cell subsets. This might then lead, through multiple oncogenic events, to benign first and malignant thereafter clonal B cell expansion. Understanding how the B cell are activated, how the B cell receptor activation can be maintained under control, which check-points could be deregulated and lead to a persistent activation is of crucial importance in benign and malignant diseases. The evidence suggests that the B cells faulty check-points are different in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, in cryoglobulinemia, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus and systemic sclerosis.","['Ferraccioli, Gianfranco', 'Tolusso, Barbara']","['Ferraccioli G', 'Tolusso B']","['Division of Rheumatology, School of Medicine, Catholic University of the Sacred Heart-CIC Via Moscati 31, Rome, 00168 Italy. gf.ferraccioli@rm.unicatt.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20070326,Netherlands,Autoimmun Rev,Autoimmunity reviews,101128967,"['0 (Autoantibodies)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Autoantibodies/immunology', 'Autoimmune Diseases/*immunology/virology', '*Autoimmunity', 'B-Lymphocyte Subsets/immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology/metabolism', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cryoglobulinemia/immunology/metabolism', 'DNA Virus Infections/*immunology/virology', 'Fibrosis/immunology', 'Humans', 'Inflammation/immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology/virology', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/*immunology/metabolism']",2007/11/24 09:00,2008/03/14 09:00,['2007/11/24 09:00'],"['2007/11/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/14 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1568-9972(07)00059-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.autrev.2007.02.013 [doi]']",ppublish,Autoimmun Rev. 2007 Dec;7(2):109-13. doi: 10.1016/j.autrev.2007.02.013.

In particular, the absence of somatic mutations in the immunoglobulin variable region genes and expression of the protein tyrosine kinase ZAP-70 are strongly associated with an aggressive clinical course, and both features have been correlated with a greater capacity of the BCR to transmit antigen-induced signals. Additionally, differences in BCR structure and reactivity indicate that CLL B-cells from the two prognostic subsets may recognize different types of antigens. Antigens that are not rapidly internalized induce sustained BCR signaling that can promote the survival of the leukemic B-cells. The BCR signal is initially transmitted by the Syk kinase and modulated by ZAP-70, which shows inefficient or absent tyrosine kinase activation in B-cells. However, both ZAP-70 expression and sustained BCR engagement have been associated with prolonged activation of the Akt and ERK kinases, which is required for the induction of several antiapoptotic proteins, including Mcl-1, Bcl-xL and XIAP. Therefore, targeting components along the BCR signaling pathway may be a promising strategy for the treatment of CLL.","['Efremov, Dimitar G', 'Gobessi, Stefania', 'Longo, Pablo G']","['Efremov DG', 'Gobessi S', 'Longo PG']","['Molecular Hematology Group, International Centre for Genetic Engineering & Biotechnology, Monterotondo Outstation, CNR Campus A.

18035189,NLM,MEDLINE,20080108,20141120,0149-2918 (Print) 0149-2918 (Linking),29,9,2007 Sep,Nelarabine: a novel purine antimetabolite antineoplastic agent.,1887-99,"BACKGROUND: Nelarabine was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in October 2005 for the treatment of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-LBL) that has not responded to or has relapsed after treatment with at least 2 chemotherapy regimens. OBJECTIVES: This article reviews the pharmacology, mechanism of action, and pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of nelarabine. Also reviewed are nelarabine's clinical efficacy in T-ALL, T-LBL, and other hematologic malignancies; its toxicity profile, dosage, and administration; and areas of ongoing and future research. METHODS: Relevant literature was identified through searches of MEDLINE (1966-April 2007), International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970-April 2007), and the American Society of Hematology database (2003-2006) using the terms nelarabine, Arranon, 506U78, and 2-amino-6-methoxypurine arabinoside. The reference lists of the identified articles were searched for additional sources. Product information obtained from the manufacturer of nelarabine was consulted, as were the FDA reviews of nelarabine. All identified publications were considered, and those meeting the objectives of this review were included. RESULTS: Nelarabine, a soluble prodrug of 9-beta-D- arabinofuranosylguanine (ara-G), is a novel purine antimetabolite antineoplastic that preferentially accumulates in T-cells. Ara-G is rapidly phosphorylated in T-cells to ara-G triphosphate (ara-GTP), which exerts cytotoxic effects. Renal elimination of ara-G is decreased in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment; however, no dose adjustment is recommended. Accumulation of ara-GTP occurs in T-cells in a dose-dependent manner, leading to preferential cytotoxicity. Nelarabine has activity in T-cell malignancies, as evaluated in 2 Phase I and 5 Phase II studies. It received accelerated approval from the FDA based on the resuits of 2 Phase II trials, one in pediatric patients (PGAA 2001) and the other in adults (CALGB 19801). In PGAA 2001, patients with T-ALL in first relapse (n = 33) had an objective response rate of 55% (16 with a complete response [CR] and 2 with a partial response [PR]), and those with T-ALL in second relapse (n = 30) had an objective response rate of 27% (7 CR and 1 PR). Among patients with central nervous system-positive T-ALL or T-cell non-Hodgkins lymphoma (T-NHL) (n = 21), 33% had an objective response (5 CR and 2 PR); among patients with T-ALL or T-NHL with extramedullary relapse (n = 22), 14% had a PR. CALGB 19801 included 39 adult patients with T-cell malignancies, of whom 7 (18%) had a CR and an additional 2 (5%) had a CR without full hematologic recovery. The recommended dose of nelarabine in adults is 1500 mg/m(2) IV given over 2 hours on days 1, 3, and 5, repeated every 21 days; the recommended dose in pediatric patients is 650 mg/m(2) IV given over 1 hour for 5 consecutive days, repeated every 21 days. Dose-limiting toxicities observed in the Phase I and II trials included central and peripheral neurotoxicity. Symptoms of central neurotoxicity included somnolence, seizures, dizziness, confusion, and ataxia; symptoms of peripheral neurotoxicity included paresthesias, pain in the extremities, and peripheral neuropathy. CONCLUSIONS: Nelarabine is indicated for the treatment of T-ALL and T-LBL that has not responded to or has relapsed after treatment with at least 2 chemotherapy regimens. Objective response rates in Phase II clinical trials of nelarabine have ranged from 11% to 60%. Use of nelarabine is limited by potentially severe neurotoxicity.","['Buie, Larry W', 'Epstein, Stacy S', 'Lindley, Celeste M']","['Buie LW', 'Epstein SS', 'Lindley CM']","['Division of Pharmacotherapy and Experimental Therapeutics, University of North Carolina School of Pharmacy, Chapel Hill, North Carolina 27599, USA. larry_buie@email.unc.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Clin Ther,Clinical therapeutics,7706726,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Arabinonucleosides)', '0 (Purine Nucleosides)', '60158CV180 (nelarabine)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Arabinonucleosides/administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Purine Nucleosides/administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use']",2007/11/24 09:00,2008/01/09 09:00,['2007/11/24 09:00'],"['2007/05/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/11/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/09 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0149-2918(07)00283-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.clinthera.2007.09.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Ther. 2007 Sep;29(9):1887-99. doi: 10.1016/j.clinthera.2007.09.002.,,,,,,,,29,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Haematopoietic stem cell transplantation is the only established option for definitive cure for patients with a suitable donor and is indicated when conventional prophylaxis and therapy with antimicrobial medication fail. Gene therapy has the potential to cure CGD, and several clinical trials have been conducted since 1997. Whereas initial studies resulted in low and short-term engraftment of CGD-corrected cells, recent trials demonstrated clinical benefit when engraftment was enhanced by busulfan conditioning prior to infusion of gene-corrected cells. However, the progress in gene therapy has been hampered by the appearance of insertional mutagenesis causing leukaemia in a trial for patients with X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency and by the emergence of dominant clones in a recent trial for the X-linked form of CGD. These findings stimulated the development of modified vector systems that demonstrate reduced genotoxicity in vitro and in animal models. New gene therapy protocols that allow efficient gene transfer and durable expression but limit the risk for insertional mutagenesis are envisioned to become an important therapeutic option for patients with CGD.","['Ryser, Martin F', 'Roesler, Joachim', 'Gentsch, Marcus', 'Brenner, Sebastian']","['Ryser MF', 'Roesler J', 'Gentsch M', 'Brenner S']","['University Clinic Carl Gustav Carus Dresden, Department of Pediatrics, Building 21, Fetscher Street 74 , 01307 Dresden, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,England,Expert Opin Biol Ther,Expert opinion on biological therapy,101125414,,IM,"['Animals', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Disease Models, Animal', '*Genetic Therapy/adverse effects/methods/trends', 'Granulomatous Disease, Chronic/mortality/physiopathology/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Mutagenesis, Insertional/*methods']",2007/11/24 09:00,2007/12/12 09:00,['2007/11/24 09:00'],"['2007/11/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/12 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/24 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1517/14712598.7.12.1799 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Biol Ther. 2007 Dec;7(12):1799-809. doi: 10.1517/14712598.7.12.1799.,,,,,,,,84,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There have been shown in many studies that Wilms' tumor1 (WT1) gene were highly expressed in leukemic blast cells. Curcuminoids, major active components of the spice turmeric, are well known for its anticancer. Curcuminoids consist of pure curcumin, demethoxycurcumin, and bisdemethoxycurcumin. In this study, the effect of each curcuminoids'components on WT1 gene expression in leukemic cell lines (K562, HL60, U937, and Molt4) was investigated. METHODS: The levels of WT1 mRNA and WT1 protein in leukemic cell lines were assessed by RT-PCR and Western blot analysis, respectively. RESULTS: It was found that the WT1 mRNAs were detected in all 4 types of leukemic cell lines. However, the WT1 protein levels were found only in the cell lines K562 and Molt4. Pure curcumin exhibited a strong inhibitory effect on WT1 mRNA and WT1 protein expression. The treatment of leukemic cell lines with non-cytotoxic doses (5, 10, and 15 microM) of pure curcumin for 2 days reduced the level of WT1 mRNA expression and WT1 protein in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, pure curcumin at 10 microM significantly decreased the level of WT1 mRNA and protein in a time-dependent manner. CONCLUSION: Pure curcumin, an excellent curcuminoid derivative, decreased WT1 gene expression in both transcriptional and translational levels. Thus, pure curcumin is one of a potential chemotherapeutic agent used for treatment of human leukemia. However, its chemotherapeutic property will need to be studied more in future.","['Anuchapreeda, Songyot', 'Tima, Singkome', 'Duangrat, Chadarat', 'Limtrakul, Pornngarm']","['Anuchapreeda S', 'Tima S', 'Duangrat C', 'Limtrakul P']","['Division of Clinical Microscopy, Department of Medical Technology, Faculty of Associated Medical Sciences, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand. sanuchapreeda@yahoo.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071123,Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Diarylheptanoids)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)', 'IT942ZTH98 (Curcumin)', 'W2F8059T80 (demethoxycurcumin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Curcuma/*chemistry', 'Curcumin/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Diarylheptanoids', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Plant Extracts/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'U937 Cells', 'WT1 Proteins/*genetics/metabolism']",2007/11/24 09:00,2008/10/22 09:00,['2007/11/24 09:00'],"['2007/07/27 00:00 [received]', '2007/10/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/11/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/22 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/24 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00280-007-0642-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2008 Sep;62(4):585-94. doi: 10.1007/s00280-007-0642-1.

While 'classical' apoptosis is considered to depend on caspase activation, caspase-independent death is increasingly recognized as an alternative pathway. Although the DNA-damaging drug cyclophosphamide (CY) is widely used for therapy of hematological malignancies and autoimmune disorders, the molecular mechanism of apoptosis induction remains largely unknown. Here, we report that treatment of Jurkat, cytotoxic, and primary leukemic T cells with an activated analog of CY, 4-hydroperoxy-cyclophosphamide (4-OOH-CY), induces caspase activation and typical features of apoptosis, although cell death was not prevented by caspase inhibition. Also depletion of murine thymocytes and splenocytes after CY treatment in vivo was not inhibited by Z-Val-Ala-DL-Asp-fluoromethylketone (Z-VAD.fmk). Caspase-8 and receptor-induced protein (RIP) were dispensable for 4-OOH-CY-mediated apoptosis, while overexpression of Bcl-2 was partially protective. 4-OOH-CY treatment induced reactive oxygen species production, upregulation of Bax, and nuclear relocation of the mitochondrial factors apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) and endonuclease G (EndoG). The antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine substantially inhibited conformational changes of Bax, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, nuclear relocation of mitochondrial factors, and apoptosis induction in 4-OOH-CY-treated T cells. These results strongly indicate that oxidative damage-induced nuclear translocation of AIF and EndoG in 4-OOH-CY-treated T cells might represent an alternative death pathway in the absence of caspase activity.","['Strauss, G', 'Westhoff, M-A', 'Fischer-Posovszky, P', 'Fulda, S', 'Schanbacher, M', 'Eckhoff, S M', 'Stahnke, K', 'Vahsen, N', 'Kroemer, G', 'Debatin, K-M']","['Strauss G', 'Westhoff MA', 'Fischer-Posovszky P', 'Fulda S', 'Schanbacher M', 'Eckhoff SM', 'Stahnke K', 'Vahsen N', 'Kroemer G', 'Debatin KM']","[""University Children's Hospital, Ulm, Germany.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071123,England,Cell Death Differ,Cell death and differentiation,9437445,"['0 (Apoptosis Inducing Factor)', '0 (Free Radical Scavengers)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'EC 3.1.- (Endodeoxyribonucleases)', 'EC 3.1.21.- (endonuclease G)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'U880A4FUDA (perfosfamide)', 'WYQ7N0BPYC (Acetylcysteine)']",IM,"['Acetylcysteine/pharmacology', 'Active Transport, Cell Nucleus', 'Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Apoptosis Inducing Factor/*metabolism', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cyclophosphamide/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Endodeoxyribonucleases/*metabolism', 'Free Radical Scavengers/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/pharmacology', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mitochondria/metabolism', '*Oxidative Stress', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/physiology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/drug effects/physiology', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/antagonists & inhibitors']",2007/11/24 09:00,2008/04/04 09:00,['2007/11/24 09:00'],"['2007/11/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/04 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['4402272 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.cdd.4402272 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Death Differ. 2008 Feb;15(2):332-43. doi: 10.1038/sj.cdd.4402272.

Analysis of outcome of therapy showed that patients heterozygous for the XRCC3 Thr241Met allele had improved post-induction disease-free survival compared to children homozygous for the major or minor allele, each of whom had similar outcomes. Improved survival was due to reduced relapse in the heterozygous children, and this effect was most marked in children randomized to therapy likely to generate DNA double-strand breaks (etoposide, daunomycin), compared with anti-metabolite (fludarabine, cytarabine) based therapy.

Its frequency varied markedly between different MDS types ranging from 0 (RARS) to 16% (RCMD, RAEB, P<0.007). Two patients with MF showed a Janus kinase-2 mutation (V617F). Patients with MF suffered from marrow failure significantly earlier with shortening of the survival time down to 0.5 (RAEB-1/-2), and 1-2 (RCMD, RA) years in median (P<0.00005). The prognostic relevance of MF was independent of the International Prognostic Scoring System and the classification of disease. CONCLUSION: The risk of MF Differs markedly between various subtypes of MDS. MF indicates an aggressive course with a significantly faster progression to fatal marrow failure and should therefore be considered in diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of disease.","['Buesche, G', 'Teoman, H', 'Wilczak, W', 'Ganser, A', 'Hecker, H', 'Wilkens, L', 'Gohring, G', 'Schlegelberger, B', 'Bock, O', 'Georgii, A', 'Kreipe, H']","['Buesche G', 'Teoman H', 'Wilczak W', 'Ganser A', 'Hecker H', 'Wilkens L', 'Gohring G', 'Schlegelberger B', 'Bock O', 'Georgii A', 'Kreipe H']","['Institut fur Pathologie, Medizinische Hochschule Hannover, Hannover, Germany. guntram.buesche@arcor.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20071122,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Aged', 'Bone Marrow Diseases/*pathology', 'Bone Marrow Examination', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/classification/diagnosis/*pathology', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/*pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate']",2007/11/23 09:00,2008/03/28 09:00,['2007/11/23 09:00'],"['2007/11/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/28 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['2405030 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2405030 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2008 Feb;22(2):313-22. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2405030.

Groups were similar, except the chemotherapy recipients were younger at diagnosis, less likely to have T-cell ALL and had longer duration (> or = 18 months) first remission. To adjust for time-to-transplant bias, left-truncated Cox's regression models were constructed. Relapse rates were similar after chemotherapy and transplantation. In both treatment groups, relapse rates were higher in older children (11-17 years; RR 2.81, P=0.002) and shorter first remission (< 18 months; RR 3.89, P<0.001).

NK cells from 21 transplant recipients who underwent either partial (pTCD; n=11) or extensive (eTCD; n=10) T-cell depletion were compared with NK cells from their healthy donors. We report that despite the strong graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) reaction, pTCD patients, with T cells present during SCT, had a better clinical outcome than patients with eTCD transplants. In addition, the frequency of CD3- CD56(bright) and NKG2A+ NK cells was much lower in pTCD than in eTCD patients after transplantation, and the level of cytotoxicity against primary haplo-mismatched blasts was significantly more pronounced after pTCD than eTCD transplants.

Mice transplanted with bone marrow cells in which JAK2 V617F was retrovirally expressed developed PV-like features, but not ET or PMF. To address the contribution of this mutation to the pathogenesis of these three MPDs, we generated two lines of JAK2 V617F transgenic mice. One line showed granulocytosis after 4 months of age. Among 43 mice, 8 (19%) showed polycythemia and 15 (35%) showed thrombocythemia. The second line showed extreme leukocytosis and thromobocytosis. They showed anemia that means Hb value from 9 to 10 g per 100 ml when 1 month old. Myeloid cells and megakaryocytes were predominant in the bone marrow of these animals, and splenomegaly was observed. The expression of JAK2 V617F mRNA in bone marrow cells was 0.45 and 1.35 that of endogenous wild-type JAK2 in the two lines, respectively. In vitro analysis of bone marrow cells from both lines showed constitutive activation of ERK1/2, STAT5 and AKT, and augmentation of their phosphorylations by cytokine stimulation.

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of 10 SS patients and 10 healthy donors (HD) were screened by Affymetrix U133Plus2.0 chips for differential gene expression. Ten candidate genes were confirmed by qRT-PCR to be significantly overexpressed in CD4+ T cells of SS versus HD/ID. For easier clinical use, these genes were re-analyzed in PBMC; qRT-PCR confirmed five novel (DNM3, IGFL2, CDO1, NEDD4L, KLHDC5) and two known genes (PLS3, TNFSF11) to be significantly overexpressed in SS. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that CDO1 and DNM3 had the highest discriminative power in combination. Upon comparison of PBMC and skin samples of SS versus MF, CDO1 and DNM3 were found upregulated only in SS. Using anti-CDO1 antisera, differential expression of CDO1 protein was confirmed in SS CD4+ T cells. Interestingly, DNM3 and CDO1 are known to be regulated by SS-associated transcription factors TWIST1 and c-myb, respectively. Furthermore, CDO1 catalyzes taurine synthesis and taurine inhibits apoptosis and promotes chemoprotection.

In addition, novel approaches to CML treatment are considered in light of the availability of second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors. CONCLUSION: With the advent of novel agents capable of treating imatinib-resistant or imatinib-intolerant CML, it should be possible in the future to further refine treatment algorithms.","['Jabbour, Elias', 'Cortes, Jorge', 'Giles, Francis', 'Kantarjian, Hagop']","['Jabbour E', 'Cortes J', 'Giles F', 'Kantarjian H']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.

Their distinction can be difficult clinically as well as histologically. CD10 or common acute lymphoblastic leukemia antigen (CALLA) is a metallomembrane endopeptidase expressed on a variety of normal and neoplastic cells. We sought to determine if the CD10 immunostain could have diagnostic utility in distinguishing between early superficial basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). CD10 was strongly expressed in 14 out of 14 superficial BCCs and failed to express in 2 out of 2 deeply infiltrative BCCs. CD10 was negative in the tumor cells in 13 out of 13 superficially invasive SCCs and SCC in situ. CD10 expressed weakly in the surrounding stromal cells of 2 out of 13 SCCs. These findings support the utility of CD10 as a marker for early BCC, especially when SCC cannot be excluded clinically or by conventional stains.

A high percentage of infant B- and T-ALLs also display an increased expression of non DNA-binding Ikaros isoforms. It has been suggested that increased expression of non DNA-binding Ikaros isoforms and constitutively activated Notch play a cooperative role in leukemogenesis, converging on the transcriptional regulation of one or more key genes. Thus far however no demonstration of a direct link between aberrant Notch signalling and altered Ikaros isoform expression has been reported. We recently suggested that pre-TCR is the missing link between Notch and Ikaros in T cell leukemogenesis. Our studies demonstrate that the presence of pre-TCR is required to sustain a Notch3-induced altered expression of spliced Ikaros isoforms. Moreover, we identified HuD, an RNA-binding protein able to regulate both mRNA stability and alternative splicing, as the potential pre-TCR-dependent mediator of Notch3 activity. HuD is able to dysregulate the expression pattern of Ikaros isoforms, thus favouring the shift towards non DNA-binding Ikaros isoforms. We finally showed that the increased expression of non DNA-binding Ikaros isoforms is able to restrain the inhibition exerted by Ikaros on Notch3-dependent transcriptional activation of pTa promoter, thus resulting in its significant upregulation. Our findings may help in clarifying the regulatory mechanism of Ikaros alternative splicing and suggest a crosstalk among Notch3, pre-TCR signalling and spliced Ikaros variants in T cell leukemogenesis, mediated by HuD.","['Bellavia, Diana', 'Mecarozzi, Marco', 'Campese, Antonio Francesco', 'Grazioli, Paola', 'Gulino, Alberto', 'Screpanti, Isabella']","['Bellavia D', 'Mecarozzi M', 'Campese AF', 'Grazioli P', 'Gulino A', 'Screpanti I']","['Department of Experimental Medicine, University La Sapienza, Roma, taly.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20070815,United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,"['0 (Receptors, Notch)', '148971-36-2 (Ikaros Transcription Factor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/physiology', 'Humans', 'Ikaros Transcription Factor/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Notch/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction/physiology']",2007/11/23 09:00,2008/03/26 09:00,['2007/11/23 09:00'],"['2007/11/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/26 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['4894 [pii]', '10.4161/cc.6.22.4894 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2007 Nov 15;6(22):2730-4. doi: 10.4161/cc.6.22.4894.

CASE REPORT: We describe a patient with B-CLL and Sezary syndrome (SS), an erythrodermic and leukemic variant of CTCL. Despite treatment, the SS progressed to involve internal organs and eventual death of the patient from sepsis. This is the first reported case of SS coexisting with chronic lymphocytic leukemia in which an anti-V beta 13.6 antibody was used to serially track changes in circulating neoplastic T cells vis-a-vis neoplastic B cells and to detect neoplastic T cells in ascitic fluid near the end of the patient's life. DISCUSSION: We speculate that the coexistence of B-CLL and CTCL is the result of an initiating genetic or epigenetic defect at the level of the common lymphoid stem cell that predisposes both B-cell and T-cell lineages to additional oncogenic changes at a more advanced stage of differentiation.","['Karsai, Syrus', 'Hou, J Steve', 'Telang, Gladys', 'Kantor, Gary R', 'Nowell, Peter C', 'Vonderheid, Eric C']","['Karsai S', 'Hou JS', 'Telang G', 'Kantor GR', 'Nowell PC', 'Vonderheid EC']","['Laserklinik Karlsruhe, Karlsruhe, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,Switzerland,Dermatology,"Dermatology (Basel, Switzerland)",9203244,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'B-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*complications/immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/analysis', 'Sezary Syndrome/*complications/immunology/pathology', 'Skin/pathology', 'Skin Neoplasms/*complications/immunology/pathology', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism']",2007/11/23 09:00,2008/01/25 09:00,['2007/11/23 09:00'],"['2007/04/29 00:00 [received]', '2007/05/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/11/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/25 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['000109362 [pii]', '10.1159/000109362 [doi]']",ppublish,Dermatology. 2008;216(1):68-75. doi: 10.1159/000109362.,,,,,,,,59,,"['(c) 2008 S.

METHODS: We investigated whether low levels of JAK2(V617F) are present in lymphoid neoplasms using a highly sensitive and highly specific amplification refractory mutation system PCR (ARMS-PCR) assay. RESULTS: While 234 of 237 cases did not carry the JAK2(V617F) allele, it was identified in the bone marrow of 3 B cell lymphoma patients. The mutation was found to be neither associated with the lymphomas per se, nor with any signs, symptoms or laboratory findings of MPD. Moreover, JAK2(V617F) appeared subsequently in the peripheral blood of 2 of the 3 patients. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that JAK2(V617F) arises in the bone marrow of individuals before clinical manifestation of any myeloid disorders. Presence of JAK2(V617F) in bone marrow might therefore increase the risk of future MPD development, just as monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) increases the risk of multiple myeloma. We term this phenomenon 'JAK2(V617F) of undetermined significance' (JMUS). Its clinical significance remains to be determined. To our knowledge, these findings represent the first identification of JAK2(V617F) in the bone marrow of patients without myeloid malignancies.","['Wang, Y Lynn', 'Lee, Joong W', 'Kui, Jonathan S', 'Chadburn, Amy', 'Cross, Nicholas C P', 'Knowles, Daniel M', 'Coleman, Morton']","['Wang YL', 'Lee JW', 'Kui JS', 'Chadburn A', 'Cross NC', 'Knowles DM', 'Coleman M']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Weill Medical College of Cornell University, New York, NY 10021, USA. lyw2001@med.cornell.edu']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20071121,Switzerland,Acta Haematol,Acta haematologica,0141053,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Alleles', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/enzymology', 'Disease Susceptibility', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/analysis/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/enzymology/*genetics/pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell, Marginal Zone/enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Male', '*Mutation, Missense', 'Neoplasm Proteins/analysis/*genetics', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary', '*Point Mutation', 'Stomach Neoplasms/enzymology/genetics/pathology']",2007/11/23 09:00,2008/02/13 09:00,['2007/11/23 09:00'],"['2007/09/18 00:00 [received]', '2007/09/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/11/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/13 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['000111532 [pii]', '10.1159/000111532 [doi]']",ppublish,Acta Haematol. 2007;118(4):209-14. doi: 10.1159/000111532.

We examined the ability of lumiliximab to mediate apoptosis, antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, and complement-dependent cytotoxicity against primary CLL cells and CD23-expressing B-cell lines. Our data suggest that lumiliximab kills CLL cells and CD23-expressing B cells predominantly by apoptosis, which occurs through the intrinsic pathway. Lumiliximab-induced apoptosis was accompanied by the down-regulation of antiapoptotic proteins Bcl-2, Bcl-X(L), and XIAP, activation of Bax, and release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria. We also found that the addition of lumiliximab to rituximab or fludarabine results in synergistic cytotoxicity of primary CLL cells and CD23-expressing B-cell lines. We investigated the in vivo activity of lumiliximab in a human disseminated CD23(+) B-cell lymphoma SCID mouse model and found greater antitumor activity with it than with control antibody. We also found that paralysis-free survival was greater with lumiliximab plus rituximab or fludarabine than with any of those agents alone.

Lentiviral (HIV)-based RNA interference screen identified MCL1 as a key survival molecule linked to BCR signaling. Loss of MCL1 by RNA interference rendered human B-cell lymphomas sensitive to BCR-induced programmed cell death. Conversely, MCL1 overexpression blocked programmed cell death on BCR stimulation. To get insight into the mechanisms of MCL1-induced survival and transformation, we screened 41 000 human genes in a genome-wide gene expression profile analysis of MCL1-overexpressing B-cell lymphomas. Bioinformatic gene network reconstruction illustrated reprogramming of relevant oncoproteins within beta-catenin-T-cell factor signaling pathways induced by enforced MCL1 expression.

The effects of the sympathetic nervous system are mediated via release of neurotransmitters and neuropeptides from postganglionic sympathetic neurons. The present study tests the hypothesis that vascular smooth muscle cells (VSM) maintain adrenergic neurotransmitter/neuropeptide expression in the postganglionic sympathetic neurons that innervate them. The effects of rat aortic and tail artery VSM (AVSM and TAVSM, respectively) on neuropeptide Y (NPY) and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) were assessed in cultures of dissociated sympathetic neurons. AVSM decreased TH (39 +/- 12% of control) but did not affect NPY. TAVSM decreased TH (76 +/- 10% of control) but increased NPY (153 +/- 20% of control). VSM expressed leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), which are known to modulate NPY and TH expression. Sympathetic neurons innervating blood vessels expressed LIF and NT-3 receptors. Inhibition of LIF inhibited the effect of AVSM on TH. Inhibition of neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) decreased TH and NPY in neurons grown in the presence of TAVSM. These data suggest that vascular-derived LIF decreases TH and vascular-derived NT-3 increases or maintains NPY and TH expression in postganglionic sympathetic neurons. NPY and TH in vascular sympathetic nerves are likely to modulate NPY and/or norepinephrine release from these nerves and are thus likely to affect blood flow and blood pressure.

Despite the extensive use of retroviral vectors in experimental and clinical applications, the repertoire of host proteins incorporated into MMLV vector particles remains unexplored. We report here the identification of host proteins from highly purified retroviral vector preparations obtained by rate-zonal ultracentrifugation. Viral proteins were fractionated by one-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, in-gel tryptic digested, and subjected to liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry analysis. Immunogold electron microscopy studies confirmed the presence of several host membrane proteins exposed at the vector surface. These studies led to the identification of 27 host proteins on MMLV vector particles derived from 293 HEK cells, including 5 proteins previously described as part of wild-type MMLV. Nineteen host proteins identified corresponded to intracellular proteins. A total of eight host membrane proteins were identified, including cell adhesion proteins integrin beta1 (fibronectin receptor subunit beta) and HMFG-E8, tetraspanins CD81 and CD9, and late endosomal markers CD63 and Lamp-2. Identification of membrane proteins on the retroviral surface is particularly attractive, since they can serve as anchoring sites for the insertion of tags for targeting or purification purposes. The implications of our findings for retrovirus-mediated gene therapy are discussed.","['Segura, Maria Mercedes', 'Garnier, Alain', 'Di Falco, Marcos Rafael', 'Whissell, Gavin', 'Meneses-Acosta, Angelica', 'Arcand, Normand', 'Kamen, Amine']","['Segura MM', 'Garnier A', 'Di Falco MR', 'Whissell G', 'Meneses-Acosta A', 'Arcand N', 'Kamen A']","['Biotechnology Research Institute, NRC, 6100 Royalmount Avenue, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20071121,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,['0 (Membrane Proteins)'],IM,"['Cell Line', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Genetic Vectors/*chemistry/isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Membrane Proteins/*analysis/*isolation & purification', 'Microscopy, Immunoelectron', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*chemistry/*isolation & purification', 'Ultracentrifugation']",2007/11/23 09:00,2008/02/06 09:00,['2007/11/23 09:00'],"['2007/11/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['JVI.01909-07 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.01909-07 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2008 Feb;82(3):1107-17. doi: 10.1128/JVI.01909-07.

Viruses that comprise the first group, murine leukemia virus and foamy virus, integrate preferentially near transcription start sites. The second group, notably human immunodeficiency virus and simian immunodeficiency virus, preferentially targets transcription units. Avian sarcoma-leukosis virus (ASLV) and human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV), forming the third group, show little preference for any genomic feature. We have previously shown that some human cells sustain mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) infection; therefore, we infected a susceptible human breast cell line, Hs578T, and, without introducing a species-specific bias, compared the MMTV integration profile to those of other retroviruses. Additionally, we infected a mouse cell line, NMuMG, and thus we could compare MMTV integration site selection in human and mouse cells. In total, we examined 468 unique MMTV integration sites. Irrespective of whether human or mouse cells were infected, no integration bias favoring transcription start sites was detected, a profile that is reminiscent of that of ASLV and HTLV. However, in contrast to ASLV and HTLV, not even a modest tendency in favor of integration within genes was observed. Similarly, repetitive sequences and genes that are frequently tagged by MMTV in mammary tumors were not preferentially targeted in cell culture either in mouse or in human cells; hence, we conclude that MMTV displays the most random dispersion of integration sites among retroviruses determined so far.","['Faschinger, Alexander', 'Rouault, Francoise', 'Sollner, Johannes', 'Lukas, Arno', 'Salmons, Brian', 'Gunzburg, Walter H', 'Indik, Stanislav']","['Faschinger A', 'Rouault F', 'Sollner J', 'Lukas A', 'Salmons B', 'Gunzburg WH', 'Indik S']","['Research Institute for Virology and Biomedicine, University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna, Vienna A-1210, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071121,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'Mammary Tumor Virus, Mouse/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Virus Integration/genetics/*physiology']",2007/11/23 09:00,2008/02/06 09:00,['2007/11/23 09:00'],"['2007/11/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['JVI.02098-07 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.02098-07 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2008 Feb;82(3):1360-7. doi: 10.1128/JVI.02098-07.

This antiviral activity is associated with the ability to cause hypermutation of retroviral cDNA. However, recent research has indicated that Apobec proteins are also able to inhibit retroviruses by other mechanisms that are independent of their deaminase activity. We have compared the antiviral activities of human and murine Apobec3 (A3) proteins, and we have found that, consistent with previous reports, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is able to resist human A3G but is sensitive to murine A3, whereas murine leukemia virus (MLV) is relatively resistant to murine A3 (mA3) but sensitive to human A3G. In contrast to previous studies, we observed that mA3 is packaged efficiently into MLV particles. The C-terminal cytidine deaminase domain (CDD2) is required for packaging of mA3 into MLV particles, and packaging did not depend on the MLV viral RNA. However, mA3 packed into MLV particles failed to cause hypermutation of viral DNA, indicating that its deaminase activity is blocked or inhibited. hA3G also caused significantly less hypermutation of MLV than of HIV DNA. Both mA3 and the splice variant mA3Delta5 exhibited some residual antiviral activity against MLV and caused a reduction in the ability of MLV particles to generate reverse transcription products. These results suggest that MLV has evolved specific mechanisms to block the ability of Apobec proteins to mediate deaminase-dependent hypermutation.","['Browne, Edward P', 'Littman, Dan R']","['Browne EP', 'Littman DR']","['The Kimmel Center for Biology and Medicine of the Skirball Institute, New York University School of Medicine, 540 First Ave., Second Floor, New York, NY 10016, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071121,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['EC 3.5.4.1 (Cytosine Deaminase)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (APOBEC Deaminases)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (APOBEC3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (Apobec3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (Cytidine Deaminase)']",IM,"['APOBEC Deaminases', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cytidine Deaminase/chemistry/*immunology/metabolism', 'Cytosine Deaminase/chemistry/*immunology', 'HIV/*genetics/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mutation', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Species Specificity', 'Virus Assembly', 'Virus Replication/immunology']",2007/11/23 09:00,2008/02/06 09:00,['2007/11/23 09:00'],"['2007/11/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['JVI.01371-07 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.01371-07 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2008 Feb;82(3):1305-13. doi: 10.1128/JVI.01371-07.

Pesticides from workplace or environmental exposures enter breast milk. Certain pesticides have been linked to developmental neurobehavioral problems, altered function of immune cells and possibly childhood leukemia. In well-designed epidemiologic studies, adverse reproductive or developmental effects have been associated with mixed pesticide exposure in occupational settings, particularly when personal protective equipment is not used. Every class of pesticides has at least one agent capable of affecting a reproductive or developmental endpoint in laboratory animals or people, including organophosphates, carbamates, pyrethroids, herbicides, fungicides, fumigants and especially organochlorines. Many of the most toxic pesticides have been banned or restricted in developed nations, but high exposures to these agents are still occurring in the most impoverished countries around the globe. Protective clothing, masks and gloves are more difficult to tolerate in hot, humid weather, or may be unavailable or unaffordable. Counseling patients who are concerned about reproductive and developmental effects of pesticides often involves helping them assess their exposure levels, weigh risks and benefits, and adopt practices to reduce or eliminate their absorbed dose. Patients may not realize that by the first prenatal care visit, most disruptions of organogenesis have already occurred. Planning ahead provides the best chance of lowering risk from pesticides and remediating other risk factors before conception.","['Frazier, Linda M']",['Frazier LM'],"['Department of Obstetrics, University of Kansas School of Medicine, Wichita, KS 67214, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,England,J Agromedicine,Journal of agromedicine,9421530,['0 (Pesticides)'],IM,"['Abortion, Spontaneous/*chemically induced', ""Agricultural Workers' Diseases/*chemically induced"", 'Environmental Exposure', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Pesticides/*toxicity', 'Pregnancy', 'Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects']",2007/11/23 09:00,2008/01/04 09:00,['2007/11/23 09:00'],"['2007/11/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/04 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/23 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1300/J096v12n01_04 [doi]'],ppublish,J Agromedicine. 2007;12(1):27-37. doi: 10.1300/J096v12n01_04.,,,,,,,,64,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although canonical Wnt pathway is a 'hot spot' for methylation in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), the role of Wnt5a abnormalities has never been evaluated in this clinical setting. The methylation status of the WNT5A promoter was analysed by methylation-specific PCR (MSP) and sequencing in six ALL-derived cell lines (TOM-1, NALM-20, MY, LOUCY, JURKAT and TANOUE) and in 307 ALL patients. WNT5A and CYCLIN D1 expressions were assessed by quantitative RT-PCR. We observed WNT5A hypermethylation in all cell lines and in cells from 43% (132/307) of ALL patients. WNT5A methylation was associated with decreased WNT5A mRNA expression (P<0.001) and this expression was restored after exposure to the demethylating agent 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine. Moreover, WNT5A hypermethylation correlated with upregulation of CYCLIN D1 expression (P=0.002).

Multivariate analysis demonstrated that WNT5A methylation was an independent prognostic factor predicting DFS (P=0.003) and OS (P=0.04).

In the present study, we looked at the expression of this factor in the superior cervical ganglion (SCG) after axotomy and after other manipulations that induce certain aspects of the cell body response to axotomy. Sympathetic ganglia from intact rats and mice exhibit only a very occasional neuronal nucleus with activating transcription factor 3-like immunoreactivity (ATF3-IR); however, as early as 6 h and as late as 3 weeks postaxotomy, many of the neurons showed intense ATF3-IR. A second population of cells had smaller and generally less intensely stained nuclei, and at least some of these cells were satellite cells. Lesions distal to the SCG induced by administration of 6-hydroxydopamine or unilateral removal of the salivary glands produced increases in ATF3-IR similar to those seen after proximal axotomy, indicating that this response is not strictly dependent on the distance of the lesion from the cell body. Two proposed signals for triggering ATF3 expression were examined: reduction in nerve growth factor (NGF) availability and induction of the cytokine leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). While administration of an antiserum raised against NGF to intact animals induced ATF3-IR, induction of ATF3-IR after axotomy was not reduced in LIF null mutant mice. Since axotomy, 6-hydroxydopamine, and sialectomy are known to decrease the concentration of NGF in the SCG, our data suggest that these decreases in NGF lead to increases in ATF3-IR. Furthermore, since the number of neurons in the SCG expressing ATF3-IR was greater after axotomy than after antiserum against NGF treatment, this raises the possibility that decreased NGF is not the only process regulating ATF3 expression after axotomy.","['Hyatt Sachs, H', 'Schreiber, R C', 'Shoemaker, S E', 'Sabe, A', 'Reed, E', 'Zigmond, R E']","['Hyatt Sachs H', 'Schreiber RC', 'Shoemaker SE', 'Sabe A', 'Reed E', 'Zigmond RE']","['Department of Neurosciences, Case Western Reserve University, 10900 Euclid Avenue, Cleveland, OH 44106-4975, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20071018,United States,Neuroscience,Neuroscience,7605074,"['0 (Activating Transcription Factor 3)', '0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Sympatholytics)', '8HW4YBZ748 (Oxidopamine)', '9061-61-4 (Nerve Growth Factor)']",IM,"['Activating Transcription Factor 3/genetics/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Antibodies/pharmacology', '*Axotomy', 'Ganglia, Sympathetic/*cytology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects/*physiology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Nerve Growth Factor/immunology', 'Neurons/*metabolism', 'Oxidopamine/pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Sympatholytics/pharmacology']",2007/11/23 09:00,2008/04/09 09:00,['2007/11/23 09:00'],"['2007/07/25 00:00 [received]', '2007/10/09 00:00 [revised]', '2007/10/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/11/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/09 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0306-4522(07)01294-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.neuroscience.2007.10.008 [doi]']",ppublish,Neuroscience. 2007 Dec 19;150(4):887-97. doi: 10.1016/j.neuroscience.2007.10.008.

However, the underlying mechanisms of its action are not completely understood. In the present study, we used human leukemia cells to gain further insight into the mechanism of esculetin-induced anti-proliferative action and apoptosis. It was found that esculetin inhibits cell viability by inducing apoptosis, as evidenced by the formation of apoptotic bodies, DNA fragmentation, and the accumulation of cells in the sub-G1 phase. Esculetin-induced apoptosis was correlated with mitochondrial dysfunction, leading to the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria to the cytosol, as well as the proteolytic activation of caspases. The z-DEVD-fmk caspase-3 inhibitor and the ectopic expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 significantly inhibited esculetin-induced apoptosis, demonstrating the important role of caspase-3 and mitochondrial proteins in the observed cytotoxic effect. Furthermore, esculetin selectively increased the phosphorylation of extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), but not that of other kinases such as Akt and p38 activation. In addition, an ERK-specific inhibitor, PD98059, and a JNK-specific inhibitor, SP600125, showed inhibited sub-G1 phase DNA content, DNA fragmentation, caspase activation, and mitochondrial dysfunction induced by esculetin treatment.

Recent studies demonstrated that the combined administration of 1,25-(OH)(2)D(3) and differentiation-enhancing agents could alleviate the side effects of 1,25-(OH)(2)D(3) and improve the rate of long term survival. In this study, we determined the enhancing activities of ceramide derivatives on 1,25-(OH)(2)D(3)-induced differentiation of human myeloid leukemia HL-60 cells. Importantly, some of these derivatives -- namely, A2, B3, and H9 -- enhanced the 1,25-(OH)(2)D(3)-induced differentiation of HL-60 cells in a concentration-dependent manner.

Recently, it was shown that cellular senescence is induced in proliferating cells within a short period of time by oxidative stresses. This phenomenon is known as premature senescence. However, it is still unknown whether premature senescence can be also induced in cardiomyocytes. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether a senescence-like phenotype can be induced in cardiomyocytes by oxidative stress. In cardiomyocytes obtained from aged rats (24 months of age), the staining for senescence-associated beta-galactosidase increased significantly and the protein or RNA levels of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors increased compared to those of young rats. Decreased cardiac troponin I phosphorylation and telomerase activity were also observed in aged cardiomyocytes. Treatment of cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes with a low concentration of doxorubicin (DOX) (10(-7) mol L(-1)) did not induce apoptosis but did induce oxidative stress, which was confirmed by 2',7'-dichlorofluorescin diacetate staining. In DOX-treated neonatal cardiomyocytes, increased positive staining for senescence-associated beta-galactosidase, cdk-I expression, decreased cardiac troponin I phosphorylation, and decreased telomerase activity were observed, as aged cardiomyocytes. Alterations in mRNA expression typically seen in aged cells were observed in DOX-treated neonatal cardiomyocytes. We also found that promyelocytic leukemia protein and acetylated p53, key proteins involved in stress-induced premature senescence in proliferating cells, were associated with cellular alterations of senescence in DOX-treated cardiomyocytes. In conclusion, cardiomyocytes treated with DOX showed characteristic changes similar to cardiomyocytes of aged rats. promyelocytic leukemia-related p53 acetylation may be an underlying mechanism of senescence-like alterations in cardiomyocytes. These findings indicate a novel mechanism of myocardial dysfunction induced by oxidative stress.","['Maejima, Yasuhiro', 'Adachi, Susumu', 'Ito, Hiroshi', 'Hirao, Kenzo', 'Isobe, Mitsuaki']","['Maejima Y', 'Adachi S', 'Ito H', 'Hirao K', 'Isobe M']","['Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071121,England,Aging Cell,Aging cell,101130839,"['0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Troponin I)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)', 'EC 3.2.1.23 (beta-Galactosidase)']",IM,"['Acetylation/drug effects', 'Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cellular Senescence/*drug effects/physiology', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/biosynthesis', 'Doxorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Myocytes, Cardiac/*drug effects/enzymology/*pathology', '*Oxidative Stress', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Rats', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Telomerase/metabolism', 'Troponin I/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/metabolism', 'beta-Galactosidase/analysis']",2007/11/23 09:00,2008/03/29 09:00,['2007/11/23 09:00'],"['2007/11/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/29 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['ACE358 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1474-9726.2007.00358.x [doi]']",ppublish,Aging Cell. 2008 Mar;7(2):125-36. doi: 10.1111/j.1474-9726.2007.00358.x.

In general, SUMO modification is associated with transcriptional repression. Although many SUMO-modified transcription factors and co-activators have been identified, little is known about the mechanism underlying SUMOylation-elicited transcriptional repression. Here, we summarize that SUMO modification of transcription factors such as androgen receptor, glucocorticoid receptor, Smad4 and CBP [CREB (cAMP-response-element-binding protein)-binding protein] co-activator results in the recruitment of a transcriptional co-repressor Daxx, thereby causing transcriptional repression. Such a SUMO-dependent recruitment of Daxx is mediated by the interaction between the SUMO moiety of SUMOylated factors and Daxx SUMO-interacting motif. Interestingly, the transrepression effect of Daxx on these SUMOylated transcription factors can be relieved by SUMOylated PML (promyelocytic leukaemia) via altering Daxx partition from the targeted gene promoter to PML nuclear bodies. Because Daxx SUMO-interacting motif is a common binding site for SUMOylated factors, a model of competition for Daxx recruitment between SUMOylated PML and SUMOylated transcription factors was proposed. Together, our findings strongly suggest that Daxx functions as a SUMO reader in the SUMO-dependent regulation of transcription and subnuclear compartmentalization.","['Shih, H-M', 'Chang, C-C', 'Kuo, H-Y', 'Lin, D-Y']","['Shih HM', 'Chang CC', 'Kuo HY', 'Lin DY']","['Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Academia Sinica, 128, Sec. 2, Academia RD, Taipei 11529, Taiwan. hmshih@ibms.sinica.edu.tw']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,England,Biochem Soc Trans,Biochemical Society transactions,7506897,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Co-Repressor Proteins)', '0 (DAXX protein, human)', '0 (Molecular Chaperones)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Small Ubiquitin-Related Modifier Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/*metabolism', 'Cell Compartmentation', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', 'Co-Repressor Proteins', 'Molecular Chaperones', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Small Ubiquitin-Related Modifier Proteins/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic/genetics/physiology']",2007/11/23 09:00,2008/03/20 09:00,['2007/11/23 09:00'],"['2007/11/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/20 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['BST0351397 [pii]', '10.1042/BST0351397 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Soc Trans. 2007 Dec;35(Pt 6):1397-400. doi: 10.1042/BST0351397.,,,,,,,,47,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A fundamental property of IL-2 activated effector cells is to selectively lyse freshly isolated tumour cells. Work carried out on animal tumour models and application in human therapeutics has suggested the potential value of an immunotherapeutic approach in haematological malignancies, especially in the setting of minimal residual disease. Extensive phase I/II trials have been conducted in all haematological diseases, but the most interesting results have been obtained in acute myeloid leukaemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, where the possibility of achieving partial and complete responses in patients with advanced disease has been reported. The feasibility and immunomodulatory effects of IL-2 treatment in patients with minimal residual disease after high-dose chemotherapy have also been explored. However, the heterogeneity of cases treated and administration schedules used does not allow definitive conclusions to be drawn about the true impact of IL-2 treatment on the prognosis of these patients.

Although it is unlikely that all patients with the HES will respond equally well to the same treatment, the use of currently available agents to lower the total eosinophil count to <10(9)/L can be lifesaving. Until recently, treatment of HES has been modelled after that of other haematological disorders by using combinations of various cytotoxic agents. This approach has led to the development of the current standard regimens of therapy. With improved understanding of the effects of corticosteroids and interferon-alpha (IFNalpha) on eosinophilopoiesis and on the actions of eosinophil-active cytokines, a new plateau has been reached where agents are targeted specifically to defeat uncontrolled eosinophilopoiesis. We now consider IFNalpha a first line agent for new HES patients as well as for controlling eosinophilia resistant to conventional therapy. IFNalpha as a single agent is effective for long term control of HES. Most patients respond to a dosage of 2 to 9 MU/day. Frequently, the dosage can be lowered after eosinophilia has been controlled. Sudden discontinuation of IFNalpha has resulted in recurrence of eosinophilia within weeks. If a suboptimal response occurs, prednisone or hydroxycarbamide (hydroxyurea) can be added. Resistance to IFNalpha may indicate development of a myeloproliferative or lymphoproliferative state or of eosinophilic leukaemia. As a new option for drug-resistant HES, allogeneic bone marrow transplantation should be considered. Although the number of patients is still small, within the past several years durable responses have been reported. Treatment of the cardiovascular sequelae of HES remains a therapeutic challenge. Improved cardiac surgery techniques have allowed many patients to benefit from ventricular decortication and valve replacement. It is important to combine control of eosinophilia with any operative intervention in HES because of the danger of recurrent disease if eosinophilia remains unchecked. Long term anticoagulation is probably indicated in patients with evident cardiac thrombus or peripheral vascular emboli; however, whether HES patients should routinely receive anticoagulants and whether continued anticoagulation should be given after eosinophilia has been controlled remain unanswered questions.","['Butterfield, J H']",['Butterfield JH'],"['Division of Allergy/Outpatient Infectious Disease and Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic and Mayo Foundation, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,New Zealand,BioDrugs,"BioDrugs : clinical immunotherapeutics, biopharmaceuticals and gene therapy",9705305,,,,1997/05/01 00:00,1997/05/01 00:01,['1997/05/01 00:00'],"['1997/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['070502 [pii]', '10.2165/00063030-199707050-00002 [doi]']",ppublish,BioDrugs. 1997 May;7(5):341-55. doi: 10.2165/00063030-199707050-00002.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its lack of haematological toxicity allows its incorporation into phases of therapy in which myelosuppression would be expected either from the disease itself (induction therapy) or secondary to other chemotherapeutic agents (consolidation, intensification or reinduction phases of therapy). Its antileukaemic effect is related to the degree and duration of asparagine depletion. The 2 native forms of L-asparaginase are derived from Escherichia coli and Erwinia chrysanthemi. The half-lives (t((1/2))) of these forms are approximately 1.2 and 0.6 days, respectively. In order to increase the biological t((1/2)), pegaspargase was synthesised by the covalent attachment of monomethoxypolyethylene glycol (PEG) to native E. coli L-asparaginase: it has a t((1/2)) of approximately 5.7 days. The duration of asparagine depletion, the substrate amino acid of the drug, is directly related to asparaginase t((1/2)). Asparaginase is associated with several unique toxicities, including hyperglycaemia, hypolipoproteinaemia, hypoalbuminaemia, coagulation factor deficiencies, hepatotoxicity and pancreatitis. Since asparaginase is a protein, it may induce hypersensitivity reactions. The incidence of these reactions increases with use. In addition, silent hypersensitivity, i.e. the development of IgG antibodies without clinical reactions, results in a decreased t((1/2)) of asparaginase, shortened duration of asparagine depletion, and probably decreased efficacy. The use of pegaspargase allows continued treatment with asparaginase in patients with clinical hypersensitivity reactions. In addition, its use in patients with silent hypersensitivity may maintain the efficacy of asparaginase. So far, the optimal use of the 3 forms of asparaginase has not been determined in children with ALL, partly due to the lack of appropriate pharmacokinetic monitoring methods. As the technology has become available, it has been demonstrated that there is little rationale for the dosage and administration schedules presently in use. Studies are required to determine appropriate dosages and administration methods (intravenous or intramuscular) and schedules for each form of asparaginase, based upon pharmacokinetic parameters. The incidence and time to onset of hypersensitivity (clinical or silent) reactions and the appropriate means of continuing asparaginase therapy with therapeutic effect needs to be evaluated. Pharmacokinetic studies are now available as a research tool. These will allow further investigation to determine if failure to maintain asparagine depletion is a remediable cause of treatment failure.","['Ettinger, L J', 'Ettinger, A G', 'Avramis, V I', 'Gaynon, P S']","['Ettinger LJ', 'Ettinger AG', 'Avramis VI', 'Gaynon PS']","['Division of Paediatric Hematology-Oncology, University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, New Brunswick, New Jersey, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,New Zealand,BioDrugs,"BioDrugs : clinical immunotherapeutics, biopharmaceuticals and gene therapy",9705305,,,,1997/01/01 00:00,1997/01/01 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['070105 [pii]', '10.2165/00063030-199707010-00005 [doi]']",ppublish,BioDrugs. 1997 Jan;7(1):30-9. doi: 10.2165/00063030-199707010-00005.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The results show that heparanase levels are elevated in the plasma of pediatric cancer patients and closely correlate with treatment responsiveness, indicating that heparanase levels can be used to diagnose and monitor patient's response to anticancer treatment.","['Shafat, Itay', 'Barak, Ayelet Ben', 'Postovsky, Sergey', 'Elhasid, Ronit', 'Ilan, Neta', 'Vlodavsky, Israel', 'Arush, Miriam Weyl Ben']","['Shafat I', 'Barak AB', 'Postovsky S', 'Elhasid R', 'Ilan N', 'Vlodavsky I', 'Arush MW']","['Cancer and Vascular Biology Research Center, The Bruce Rappaport Faculty of Medicine, Technion, Haifa, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Neoplasia,"Neoplasia (New York, N.Y.)",100886622,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', 'EC 3.2.1.- (heparanase)', 'EC 3.2.1.31 (Glucuronidase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*blood', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'Glucuronidase/*blood', 'Hodgkin Disease/blood', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*blood/diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood', 'Sarcoma/blood']",2007/11/22 09:00,2007/12/21 09:00,['2007/11/22 09:00'],"['2007/08/02 00:00 [received]', '2007/09/06 00:00 [revised]', '2007/09/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/11/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/21 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/22 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1593/neo.07673 [doi]'],ppublish,Neoplasia. 2007 Nov;9(11):909-16. doi: 10.1593/neo.07673.,,"['R01 CA106456/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R0I-CA106456/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC2077882,,,,,,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['ELISA', 'Heparanase', 'anticancer treatment', 'marker']",,,,,

In typical MPD cases (N = 8), which served as a control group, those with a homozygous V617F mutation showed clear uniparental disomy (UPD) of 9p using SNP-A. Consistent with possible genomic instability, in 19/30 MDS/MPD-U patients, we found additional lesions not identified by metaphase cytogenetics. In addition to UPD9p, we also have detected UPD affecting other chromosomes, including 1 (2/30), 11 (4/30), 12 (1/30) and 22 (1/30). Transformation to AML was observed in 8/30 patients. In 5 V617F+ patients who progressed to AML, we show that SNP-A can allow for the detection of two modes of transformation: leukemic blasts evolving from either a wild-type jak2 precursor carrying other acquired chromosomal defects, or from a V617F+ mutant progenitor characterized by UPD9p.

There are three possible methodologies to isolate or identify cancer stem cells; the use of a surface marker, use of cells cultured in a specific condition (sphere), or the use of side population cells identified by FACS. The gold standard assay that fulfills the definition of cancer stem cell may be serial transplantation in animal models. Cancer stem cells are likely to be responsible for disease relapse or metastasis, and also for resistance to radiation or conventional chemotherapy. The stem cell niche plays an important role on maintaining cancer stem cells. The novel promising therapies against cancer stem cells are considered, including antibody-based therapy, signal inhibitors, overcoming radiation and drug resistance, or differentiation therapy.

Loss of p15 expression has been associated with several cancer types but its silencing is frequent in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myeloid dysplastic syndrome (MDS). Several mechanisms have been identified that are responsible for silencing the gene encoding p15 in myeloid disease, including gene hypermethylation, transcription factor deregulation and direct inhibition by translocation products. The effect of p15 loss during disease may be attributed to the dual role of this protein as a mediator of cell cycle arrest in late stage myeloid progenitors and as a regulator of differentiation in early common myeloid progenitors (CMP). Here we outline the mechanisms by which p15 is silenced and the functions of this CDKI in myelopoiesis as well as discuss the implications of these findings to myeloid disease.","['Rosu-Myles, Michael', 'Wolff, Linda']","['Rosu-Myles M', 'Wolff L']","['Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, NIH, Building 37, Room 4124A, 37 Convent Drive MSC 4263, Bethesda, MD 20892-4263, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20071029,United States,Blood Cells Mol Dis,"Blood cells, molecules & diseases",9509932,['0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15/genetics/*metabolism', 'DNA Methylation', 'G1 Phase', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/*metabolism', 'Myeloid Cells/*metabolism', 'Myeloid Progenitor Cells/cytology/*metabolism', '*Myelopoiesis/genetics']",2007/11/22 09:00,2008/08/06 09:00,['2007/11/22 09:00'],"['2007/09/11 00:00 [received]', '2007/09/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/11/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1079-9796(07)00219-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bcmd.2007.09.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Cells Mol Dis. 2008 May-Jun;40(3):406-9. doi: 10.1016/j.bcmd.2007.09.005.

They possess a broad spectrum of pharmacological activities. It has been shown that their anti-tumor activity is mediated via different mechanisms, which can be promising targets for anti-cancer therapy. We focused our study on the differential effects of these alkaloids upon cell viability, DNA damage effect and nucleus integrity in mouse primary spleen cells and mouse lymphocytic leukemic cells, L1210. Sanguinarine and chelerythrine produce a dose-dependent increase in DNA damage and cytotoxicity in both primary mouse spleen cells and L1210 cells. Chelidonine did not show a significant cytotoxicity or damage DNA in both cell types, but completely arrested growth of L1210 cells. Examination of nuclear morphology revealed more cells with apoptotic features upon treatment with chelerythrine and sanguinarine, but not chelidonine. In contrast to primary mouse spleen cells, L1210 cells showed slightly higher sensitivity to sanguinarine and chelerythrine treatment. This suggests that cytotoxic and DNA damaging effects of chelerythrine and sanguinarine are more selective against mouse leukemic cells and primary mouse spleen cells, whereas chelidonine blocks proliferation of L1210 cells. The action of chelidonine on normal and tumor cells requires further investigation.","['Kaminskyy, Vitaliy', 'Lin, Kah-Wai', 'Filyak, Yevhen', 'Stoika, Rostyslav']","['Kaminskyy V', 'Lin KW', 'Filyak Y', 'Stoika R']","['Department of Regulation of Cell Proliferation and Apoptosis, Institute of Cell Biology, National Academy of Sciences, Drahomanov Street 14/16, 79005 Lviv, Ukraine.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20070919,England,Cell Biol Int,Cell biology international,9307129,"['0 (Anti-Infective Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzophenanthridines)', '0 (Isoquinolines)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '8K7EK8446J (chelidonine)', 'AV9VK043SS (sanguinarine)', 'E3B045W6X0 (chelerythrine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anti-Infective Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Benzophenanthridines/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor/drug effects', 'Cell Shape/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/*drug effects', 'Comet Assay', 'DNA Damage/*drug effects', 'Isoquinolines/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia', 'Mice', 'Molecular Structure', 'Plant Extracts/chemistry/pharmacology', '*Spleen/cytology/drug effects']",2007/11/22 09:00,2008/06/19 09:00,['2007/11/22 09:00'],"['2007/05/14 00:00 [received]', '2007/08/01 00:00 [revised]', '2007/09/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/11/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/19 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1065-6995(07)00236-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cellbi.2007.09.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Biol Int. 2008 Feb;32(2):271-7. doi: 10.1016/j.cellbi.2007.09.004.

METHODS: Following a systematic literature search, relative risks were extracted from 14 studies published between 1984 and 2004. Fixed effect analyses were carried out as heterogeneity between studies was not detected. Meta-analyses were performed on the whole set of data and separate analyses were conducted for specific chemical classes of pesticides as well as type of leukaemia. RESULTS: The meta-rate ratio estimate for all studies was 1.43 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.05-1.94). After stratification by chemical class, consistent increases in the risk of leukaemia were found in all groups but statistical significance was found only for phenoxy herbicides unlikely to have been contaminated with dioxins and furans. This last finding appears equivocal in view of the existing literature. The separate analysis conducted on leukaemias from the myeloid lineage showed the highest relative risk (6.99; 95% CI 1.96-24.90). There was no obvious indication of publication bias. CONCLUSION: The overall meta-analysis among pesticide manufacturing workers provides quantitative evidence to consider occupational exposure to pesticides as a possible risk factor for leukaemia but available data are too scarce for causality ascertainment. Epidemiological evidence did not allow identifying a specific pesticide or chemical class that would be responsible for the increased risk. Exposure to pesticides may be a significant risk factor for specifically developing myeloid leukaemia and there is a need for additional large well-conducted studies with clear definition of exposure and of leukaemia type(s).","['Van Maele-Fabry, Genevieve', 'Duhayon, Sophie', 'Mertens, Claire', 'Lison, Dominique']","['Van Maele-Fabry G', 'Duhayon S', 'Mertens C', 'Lison D']","['Universite catholique de Louvain, Industrial Toxicology and Occupational Medicine Unit, Avenue E.

METHODS: Real-time quantitative PCR detection of TRECs was carried out in the DNA of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 23 leukemia patients who underwent MSD-BMT. The content of TRECs in 70 normal donor individuals was also detected to determine the normal range of TRECs in healthy subjects. Among them, 10 patients received RT-PCR to amplify 24 subfamily genes of T-cell receptor B variable (TCRBV) and five normal donors served as control. The PCR products were further analyzed with genescan to evaluate the clonality of BV subfamily and calculate the usage rate of BV families. RESULTS: The mean value of TRECs in normal donors was (3351.1 +/- 3711.1) copies/10(5) cells. There was an inverse correlation between the value of TRECs and the age of healthy subjects. Before transplantation, all the patients were detected for the number of TRECs, the mean TRECs number was (307.9 +/- 433.3) copies/10(5) cells and it was far lower than that of healthy subjects. From one month to five months after bone marrow transplantative (BMT), the TRECs levels were low and in some patients they even could not be detected. Six months later, TRECs levels increased obviously and maintained that high nearly one year. 24 months after BMT, the number of TRECs increased and reached the pretransplantation status. One patient was detected 2 m and 3 m after transplantation and found that there was a tendency of additional use of BV families and an increase of the expression of CDR3 polymorphism. 2-15 months after transplantation, in ten of the patients, there were 7-16 BV subfamilies expressing and in more than 48% the expression was polyclinic. Monoclones and oligoclones existed in 24 BV subfamilies. CONCLUSIONS: At an early stage after BMT, the number of TRECs was low and remained so for a long time. TCRBV CDR3 repertoire showed certain BV families expressing. 6 months after BMT, thymus produced certain number of naive T cells and TCRBV CDR3 repertoire showed additional use of BV families and increased expression of polymorphism.","['Fu, Yue-Wen', 'Wu, De-Pei', 'Cen, Jian-Nong', 'Feng, Yu-Feng', 'Zhu, Zi-Ling', 'Zhu, Ping']","['Fu YW', 'Wu DP', 'Cen JN', 'Feng YF', 'Zhu ZL', 'Zhu P']","['Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Suzhou 215006, China.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,Zhonghua Nei Ke Za Zhi,Zhonghua nei ke za zhi,16210490R,"['0 (Receptor-CD3 Complex, Antigen, T-Cell)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/immunology/*methods', 'Female', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics/immunology/*surgery', 'Living Donors', 'Lymphocyte Depletion', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptor-CD3 Complex, Antigen, T-Cell/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Siblings', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",2007/11/22 09:00,2008/07/12 09:00,['2007/11/22 09:00'],"['2007/11/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/12 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/22 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Nei Ke Za Zhi. 2007 Sep;46(9):743-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the complexity and standardization of RQ-PCR should never be overlooked and the results should be interpreted cautiously in clinical conditions. We aimed to assess the methodology of RQ-PCR and its clinical applications in monitoring molecular kinetics of 36 newly diagnosed cases of acute promyelocytic leukemia patients with t (15; 17) from October 2004 to December 2005. METHODS: All the TaqMan probe-based RQ-PCR reactions and analysis were performed on an ABI-PRISM 7,500 platform. The quantitation of PML-RARalpha transcripts was represented by the normalized quotient, that is, PML-RARalpha transcript copies divided by ABL transcript copies. According to induction therapy, the patients were classed into two groups: group 1 (n = 23), three-drug combination including arsenics, all-trans retinoic acid and mitoxantrone; and group 2 (n = 13), two-drug combination from all-trans retinoic acid, arsenics and mitoxantrone. RESULTS: The sensitivity of RQ-PCR was 1 per 10(5) cells and 5 copies of the PML-RARalpha transcript could be reproducibly detected. No false positive results occurred in 40 non-acute promyelocytic leukemia samples. Optimal amplification efficiency could be attained, which was determined by the slope of the standard curves (slope: -3.2 - -3.7). The inter-assay and intra-assay variation coefficients of the method were 1.01% and 0.56% respectively. Although the time to attain hematological complete remission was similar in both groups, the time to achieve molecular remission of group 1 was significantly shorter than that of group 2 (61 days vs 75 days, P = 0.034). The rate of molecular remission within 70 days was higher in group 1 than in group 2 (75.00% vs 38.46%, P = 0.036). Compared with pretreatment, median reduction of the PML-RARalpha transcript before first consolidation therapy differed significantly between group 1 and group 2 (log scale, 3.15 vs 2.31, P = 0.024). Interestingly, we found that PML-RARalpha transcript levels temporarily increased in bone marrow (7 patients) and peripheral blood (22 patients) samples of patients during induction therapy in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: The RQ-PCR assay is reliable for the detection of PML-RARalpha transcripts. Arsenics, all-trans retinoic acid and mitoxantrone triad induction treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia is superior to two-drug combination induction therapy in terms of the molecular response.","['Zhu, Hong-hu', 'Liu, Yan-rong', 'Qin, Ya-zhen', 'Jiang, Bin', 'Shan, Fu-xiang', 'Wu, Shu-lan', 'Yang, Ping-di', 'Zhao, Jie', 'Lu, Dao-pei']","['Zhu HH', 'Liu YR', 'Qin YZ', 'Jiang B', 'Shan FX', 'Wu SL', 'Yang PD', 'Zhao J', 'Lu DP']","[""Institute of Hematology, Peking University People's Hospital, Beijing 100044, China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,China,Chin Med J (Engl),Chinese medical journal,7513795,"['0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/blood/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/*analysis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",2007/11/22 09:00,2007/12/14 09:00,['2007/11/22 09:00'],"['2007/11/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/14 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/22 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Chin Med J (Engl). 2007 Oct 20;120(20):1803-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ABT-737 potently induced apoptosis in Bcr-Abl(+) chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) cell lines and primary CML samples in vitro and prolonged the survival of mice xenografted with BV173 cells, a CML cell line. Higher expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins reduced cell killing by ABT-737 in each cell line, but there was no correlation between the sensitivities to ABT-737 and the specific expression patterns of Bcl-2 family proteins among cell lines. Thus, the cell killing effect of ABT-737 must be determined not only by the expression patterns of Bcl-2 family proteins but also by other mechanisms, such as high expression of Bcr-Abl, or a drug-efflux pump, in CML cells. ABT-737 augmented the cell killing effect of imatinib in Bcr-Abl(+) cells with diverse drug-resistance mechanisms unless leukaemic cells harboured imatinib-insensitive Abl kinase domain mutations, such as T315I.

Complete hematologic response was observed in all the 84 patients treated with mean daily doses of 300 mg or more and complete cytogenetic response was achieved in 94.8% of those patients. In comparison with the effects of 300 mg or more, mean daily doses of 200-300 mg led to less complete cytogenetic response (78.6% vs. 94.8%, P < 0.01), shorter complete cytogenetic remission duration (81.3% vs. 95.6% at 24 months, P = 0.01), and lower overall survival (90.0% vs. 98.8% at 36 months, P = 0.03). This study suggests that the mean daily doses of 300 mg (roughly equivalent to 100,000 mg/yr) or more may improve overall survival and that mean daily doses of imatinib during the first year may be one of the prognostic factors for CML in Japan.","['Sugita, Junichi', 'Tanaka, Junji', 'Kurosawa, Mitsutoshi', 'Fukuhara, Takashi', 'Hashino, Satoshi', 'Torimoto, Etsuhiro', 'Koizumi, Kazuki', 'Masauji, Nobuo', 'Nishimura, Susumu', 'Koda, Kyuhei', 'Imamura, Masahiro', 'Kasai, Masaharu']","['Sugita J', 'Tanaka J', 'Kurosawa M', 'Fukuhara T', 'Hashino S', 'Torimoto E', 'Koizumi K', 'Masauji N', 'Nishimura S', 'Koda K', 'Imamura M', 'Kasai M']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Hokkaido University Graduate School of Medicine, Sapporo, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20071117,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Child', '*Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Japan', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperazines/*administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Prognosis', 'Pyrimidines/*administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome']",2007/11/22 09:00,2008/02/06 09:00,['2007/11/22 09:00'],"['2007/11/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['EJH982 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0609.2007.00982.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2008 Feb;80(2):160-3. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2007.00982.x.

METHODS: In a three-colour flow cytometric assay, we evaluated the expression of L-selectin and ICAM1 on CD34+ blast cells from the bone marrow (BM) of 66 MDS patients; for the purpose of comparison CD34+ blast cells of 18 sAML and CD34+ stem cells of 17 normal donors were also analysed. RESULTS: The ratio of L-selectin/ICAM1 expression was identified as a parameter correlated with the percentage of BM blast infiltration and the time to leukaemic progression among MDS patients. In fact, the values of L-selectin/ICAM1 ratio were inversely correlated with the BM blast infiltration (r = -0.34, P = 0.004). Furthermore, MDS patients with a baseline ratio <1 had a higher leukaemic progression rate (41% vs. 19%, P = 0.008); the actuarial risk of disease progression for this subgroup of MDS patients was also higher (64% vs. 11% at 2 yr, P = 0.002). Furthermore, in two patients a decrease of the ratio was observed when overt leukaemic transformation occurred; conversely, restoration of a normal ratio was observed in two patients after a chemotherapy-induced remission. CONCLUSION: (i) L-selectin is defective in the stem cell compartment of MDS and sAML, whereas ICAM1 is overexpressed; (ii) the ratio of their expression has a prognostic role; and (iii) a ratio <1 significantly predicts progression to overt leukaemia in MDS patients.","['Buccisano, Francesco', 'Maurillo, Luca', 'Tamburini, Anna', 'Del Poeta, Giovanni', 'Del Principe, Maria Ilaria', 'Ammatuna, Emanuele', 'Consalvo, Maria Irno', 'Campagna, Selenia', 'Ottaviani, Licia', 'Sarlo, Chiara', 'Renzi, Daniela', 'Faccia, Sabrina', 'Fraboni, Daniela', 'Lo Coco, Francesco', 'Amadori, Sergio', 'Venditti, Adriano']","['Buccisano F', 'Maurillo L', 'Tamburini A', 'Del Poeta G', 'Del Principe MI', 'Ammatuna E', 'Consalvo MI', 'Campagna S', 'Ottaviani L', 'Sarlo C', 'Renzi D', 'Faccia S', 'Fraboni D', 'Lo Coco F', 'Amadori S', 'Venditti A']","['Department of Biopatologia e Diagnostica per Immagini, Policlinico Tor Vergata and Ospedale S.Eugenio, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071117,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '126547-89-5 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1)', '126880-86-2 (L-Selectin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD34/biosynthesis', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1/*biosynthesis/blood', 'L-Selectin/*biosynthesis/blood', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*diagnosis/*metabolism', 'Prognosis', 'Time Factors']",2007/11/22 09:00,2008/02/06 09:00,['2007/11/22 09:00'],"['2007/11/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['EJH986 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0609.2007.00986.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2008 Feb;80(2):107-14. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2007.00986.x.

Acquired alterations of the RFC gene have been associated with resistance to MTX in cancer cell lines and primary osteosarcomas. Here, we examined RFC for mutations and promoter hypermethylation in (i) the inherently MTX-resistant lymphoma cell line (RL); (ii) 30 paired cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) obtained at diagnosis and at relapse after treatment with MTX; and (iii) 25 cases of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) at diagnosis, none of which had been previously exposed to MTX. Aberrant hypermethylation of the RFC promoter occurred in RL cells and two of the primary DLBCLs. In one additional DLBCL, a single-base substitution in RFC was identified, leading to the introduction of a premature termination codon (c.1396C>T; p.Q466X). A missense mutation affecting the 11th transmembrane domain of RFC (c.1250T>C; p.I417T) was found in one case of ALL at diagnosis. In ALL, RFC promoter hypermethylation was found neither at diagnosis nor at relapse and thus is not a common cause of low levels of RFC expression associated with adverse outcome. In DLBCL, genetic and epigenetic alterations of RFC were detected at diagnosis in the absence of a selective MTX pressure, suggesting that these alterations may possibly contribute to the development of lymphoma.","['Kastrup, Ingelise Bjerring', 'Worm, Jesper', 'Ralfkiaer, Elisabeth', 'Hokland, Peter', 'Guldberg, Per', 'Gronbaek, Kirsten']","['Kastrup IB', 'Worm J', 'Ralfkiaer E', 'Hokland P', 'Guldberg P', 'Gronbaek K']","['Institute of Cancer Biology, Danish Cancer Society, Copenhagen, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071119,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Codon, Nonsense)', '0 (Membrane Transport Proteins)', '0 (Reduced Folate Carrier Protein)', '0 (SLC19A1 protein, human)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Biopsy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Codon, Nonsense', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/etiology/*genetics', 'Male', 'Membrane Transport Proteins/*genetics', 'Methotrexate', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Mutation, Missense', 'Point Mutation', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Reduced Folate Carrier Protein']",2007/11/22 09:00,2008/01/31 09:00,['2007/11/22 09:00'],"['2007/11/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/31 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['EJH980 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0609.2007.00980.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2008 Jan;80(1):61-6. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2007.00980.x.

This fusion gene can be detected in eosinophils, neutrophils, mast cells, T cells, B cells and monocytes in FIP1L1-PDGFRA-positive hypereosinophilic patients suggesting a multilineage involvement. Furthermore, the same FIP1L1-PDGFRA rearrangement was identified in patients with hypereosinophilia and atypical mast cell proliferations, raising the question of a disease with two concomitant lines of differentiation.

NCs play key roles during reverse transcription by chaperoning the obligatory strand transfers. In HIV-1, the first DNA strand transfer relies on the NCp7-promoted destabilization and subsequent annealing of the transactivation response element, TAR with its complementary cTAR sequence. NCp7 chaperone activity relies mainly on its two folded fingers. Since NCs with a unique zinc finger are encoded by gammaretroviruses such as the canonical Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMuLV), our objective was to characterize, by fluorescence techniques, the binding and chaperone activities of the NCp10 protein of MoMuLV to the TAR sequences of HIV-1. The unique finger and the flanking 12-25 and 40-48 domains of NCp10 were found to bind and destabilize cTAR stem-loop almost as efficiently as the homologous NCp7 protein. The flanking domains were essential for properly positioning the finger and, notably, the Trp35 residue onto cTAR. Thus, the binding and destabilization determinants scattered on the two NCp7 fingers are encoded by the unique finger of NCp10 and its flanking domains. NCp10 also activates the cTAR/TAR annealing reaction, but less efficiently than NCp7, suggesting that the two NCp7 fingers promote in concert the rate-limiting nucleation of the duplex. Due to its ability to mimic NCp7, the simple structure of NCp10 might be useful to design peptidomimetics aimed at inhibiting HIV replication.","['Egele, Caroline', 'Piemont, Etienne', 'Didier, Pascal', 'Ficheux, Damien', 'Roques, Bernard', 'Darlix, Jean-Luc', 'de Rocquigny, Hugues', 'Mely, Yves']","['Egele C', 'Piemont E', 'Didier P', 'Ficheux D', 'Roques B', 'Darlix JL', 'de Rocquigny H', 'Mely Y']","['Departement de Pharmacologie et Physico-Chimie des Interactions Cellulaires et Moleculaires, UMR 7175 CNRS, Faculte de Pharmacie, Universite Louis Pasteur, Strasbourg 1, 74, Route du Rhin, 67401 Illkirch Cedex, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071121,United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Nucleocapsid Proteins)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA, Viral/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Fluorescence Polarization', 'HIV Long Terminal Repeat/*genetics', 'HIV-1/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*metabolism', 'Nucleic Acid Conformation', 'Nucleocapsid Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding']",2007/11/22 09:00,2008/05/31 09:00,['2007/11/22 09:00'],"['2007/11/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/31 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/22 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/bi7012239 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochemistry. 2007 Dec 18;46(50):14650-62. doi: 10.1021/bi7012239.

Studies were identified by searching the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases (1966-July 2007) and by examining the references of retrieved articles. A random-effects model was used to combine the results from individual studies. We identified 9 cohort studies with data on body mass index (BMI) or obesity in relation to incidence of leukemia. Compared with nonoverweight individuals (BMI < 25 kg/m(2)), the summary relative risks (RRs) of leukemia were 1.14 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03-1.25] for overweight individuals (BMI 25-30 kg/m(2)) and 1.39 (95% CI, 1.25-1.54) for obese (BMI >or= 30 kg/m(2)) individuals. On a continuous scale, a 5 kg/m(2) increase in BMI was associated with a 13% increased risk of leukemia (RR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.07-1.19). In a meta-analysis of 4 studies reporting results on subtypes of leukemia, the summary RRs associated with obesity were 1.25 (95% CI, 1.11-1.41) for chronic lymphocytic leukemia, 1.65 (95% CI, 1.16-2.35) for acute lymphocytic leukemia, 1.52 (95% CI, 1.19-1.95) for acute myeloid leukemia and 1.26 (95% CI, 1.09-1.46) for chronic myeloid leukemia.

We now observed that leukemia cells lacking c-Met respond to this novel type of fibroblast activation, nemosis, with growth arrest and differentiation to a dendritic cell-like phenotype. This effect was counteracted by introduction of c-Met expression into these cells. Moreover, those leukemia cell lines harboring properly processed c-Met showed no effect in response to nemosis. We propose this effect to be mediated by nemosis-derived cytokine signals, and present the potential candidates induced in the nemotic fibroblasts: interleukins-1, -6, -8, -11, leukemia inhibitory factor and granulocyte-macrophage-colony-stimulating factor.

During this period, its causative agent, human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV-1), was discovered, and a crucial role of the viral product Tax in ATL leukemogenesis was demonstrated. Recently, another HTLV-1 product, HBZ, which is encoded on the negative strand, was found, and it has now become a subject of intensive research because of its possible activity in cell proliferation. It is, however, impossible to elucidate the whole process of ATL leukemogenesis by studying only HTLV-1, and aberrations of cellular genes such as tumor suppressor genes are also profoundly involved in the later stages of ATL development. In contrast with the progress in the understanding of ATL pathogenesis, more progress in developing therapy for ATL is needed, and there has been only slight improvement in the prognosis. Recently, unique therapeutic approaches targeting molecules and/or mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis have been explored, and some of them produced encouraging results that might lead to breakthrough therapies. One of these approaches, the use of monoclonal antibody against chemokine receptor CCR4, is now ongoing as a multicenter clinical trial in Japan.

In the present study, the antitumor activity of Dionysia termeana, a plant native to Iran, was investigated. Cytotoxic activity of the extract on tumor cell lines using MTT colorimetric assay was determined. Cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry and DNA fragmentation analysis on sensitive cell lines was then carried out. Results obtained indicated that the highest activity of D. termeana was against K562 leukemia cell line with IC50 less than 20 microg/mL. Fifty-five percent inhibition of Jurkat cells due to exposure to D. termeana was found at 200 microg/mL of the extract. A549, a lung carcinoma cell, and Fen bladder carcinoma cell line were less affected. In flow cytometry analysis, D. termeana induced apoptosis in the K562 and Jurkat cells. In DNA fragmentation analysis the extract produced ladder formation in both cells. In conclusion, these results indicated that the extract used in this study have antitumor activity through induction of apoptosis particularly in the leukemia cell lines.","['Amirghofran, Zahra', 'Bahmani, Masoud', 'Azadmehr, Abbas', 'Ashouri, Elham', 'Javidnia, Katayoun']","['Amirghofran Z', 'Bahmani M', 'Azadmehr A', 'Ashouri E', 'Javidnia K']","['Immunology Department, Shiraz University of Medical Science, Shiraz, Iran. amirghz@sums.ac.ir']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Cancer Invest,Cancer investigation,8307154,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Plant Extracts)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', '*Phytotherapy', 'Plant Extracts/*pharmacology', '*Primulaceae']",2007/11/21 09:00,2007/12/07 09:00,['2007/11/21 09:00'],"['2007/11/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/07 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['785375738 [pii]', '10.1080/07357900701518487 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Invest. 2007 Oct;25(7):550-4. doi: 10.1080/07357900701518487.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Earlier suggestions of previous genital infections as risk factors appear not to hold. Previous cancers are frequent among PFTC patients, especially breast cancer. Second primary cancers after PFTC are also frequent, especially non-lymphoid leukemia, colorectal, breast, bladder and lung cancer. Only 4% of primary fallopian carcinomas are correctly diagnosed before operation. Treatment consists of aggressive cytoreductive surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy with a platinum-taxane combination.

In this study, we compared the growth-inhibitory and cyto-differentiating activities of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) in NB4 (ATRA-responsive) and R4 (ATRA-resistant) acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) cells relative to BP1 levels. Expression of two oncogenes, bcl-2 and c-myc, was also assessed. NB4 and R4 cells express BP1, bcl-2, and c-myc; the expression of all three genes was repressed after ATRA treatment of NB4 cells but not R4 cells. To determine whether BP1 overexpression affects sensitivity to ATRA, NB4 cells were transfected with a BP1-expressing plasmid and treated with ATRA. In cells overexpressing BP1: (1) proliferation was no longer inhibited; (2) differentiation was reduced two- to threefold; (3) c-myc was no longer repressed. These and other data suggest that BP1 may regulate bcl-2 and c-myc expression. Clinically, BP1 levels were elevated in all pretreatment APL patients tested, while BP1 expression was decreased in 91% of patients after combined ATRA and chemotherapy treatment. Two patients underwent disease relapse during follow-up; one patient exhibited a 42-fold increase in BP1 expression, while the other showed no change. This suggests that BP1 may be part of a pathway involved in resistance to therapy. Taken together, our data suggest that BP1 is a potential therapeutic target in APL.","['Awwad, Rania T', 'Do, Khanh', 'Stevenson, Holly', 'Fu, Sidney W', 'Lo-Coco, Francesco', 'Costello, Maura', 'Campbell, Cassandra L', 'Berg, Patricia E']","['Awwad RT', 'Do K', 'Stevenson H', 'Fu SW', 'Lo-Coco F', 'Costello M', 'Campbell CL', 'Berg PE']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, The George Washington University Medical Center, Ross Building, Room 533, 2300 Eye Street, NW, Washington, DC, 20037, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071120,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DLX4 protein, human)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (MYC protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects/genetics', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology/therapeutic use']",2007/11/21 09:00,2008/04/12 09:00,['2007/11/21 09:00'],"['2007/02/27 00:00 [received]', '2007/10/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/11/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/12 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/21 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00277-007-0402-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2008 Mar;87(3):195-203. doi: 10.1007/s00277-007-0402-7.

Alone, these cells do not develop into a viable fetus or adult animal because they do not retain the potential to contribute to extraembryonic tissue, and in vitro, they lack spatial and temporal signaling cues essential to normal in vivo development. The basis of pluripotentiality resides in conserved regulatory networks composed of numerous transcription factors and multiple signaling cascades. Together, these regulatory networks maintain ES cells in a pluripotent and undifferentiated form; however, alterations in the stoichiometry of these signals promote differentiation. By taking advantage of this differentiation capacity in vitro, ES cells have clearly been shown to possess the potential to generate multipotent stem and progenitor cells capable of differentiating into a limited number of cell fates. These latter types of cells may prove to be therapeutically viable, but perhaps more importantly, the studies of these cells have led to a greater understanding of mammalian development.","['Yamanaka, Satoshi', 'Li, Jinliang', 'Kania, Gabriela', 'Elliott, Steve', 'Wersto, Robert P', 'Van Eyk, Jennifer', 'Wobus, Anna M', 'Boheler, Kenneth R']","['Yamanaka S', 'Li J', 'Kania G', 'Elliott S', 'Wersto RP', 'Van Eyk J', 'Wobus AM', 'Boheler KR']","['Laboratory of Cardiovascular Sciences, Gerontology Research Center, National Institute on Aging, 5600 Nathan Shock Drive, Baltimore, MD 21224, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071116,Germany,Cell Tissue Res,Cell and tissue research,0417625,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Proteome)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Lineage/drug effects', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Germ Layers/cytology/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Proteome/metabolism', 'Serum', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism']",2007/11/21 09:00,2009/01/29 09:00,['2007/11/21 09:00'],"['2007/06/01 00:00 [received]', '2007/09/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/11/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/29 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/21 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00441-007-0520-5 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Tissue Res. 2008 Jan;331(1):5-22. doi: 10.1007/s00441-007-0520-5.

As the second most common pediatric cancer, brain tumors lead to significantly worse survival and long-term effects compared with those seen with hematologic malignancies and other solid tumors. This review discusses current management strategies in three pediatric brain tumors, the long-term effects of therapy, as well as novel laboratory findings that may alter future treatment strategies. RECENT FINDINGS: The current literature focuses on tactics to predict those at risk of treatment failure and long-term effects. By analyzing tumors at a molecular genetics level rather than traditional histology, new data have begun to emerge on methods to begin to consider targeted therapies, tailored to the individual child. Furthermore, as survivorship has improved with current radiation and chemotherapy regimens, long-term effects have been identified and merit clinical attention. SUMMARY: Even though long-term survival for children with a brain tumor approaches 70%, the need for improved treatment regimens is striking. Secondary malignancies, neurocognitive deficits and treatment failure continue to afflict these children and young adults. The current review will inform clinicians of the challenges faced by basic scientists and clinicians when treating brain tumors, and point to future research directions.","['Partap, Sonia', 'Fisher, Paul Graham']","['Partap S', 'Fisher PG']","['Department of Neurology, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305-5826, USA. spartap@stanford.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Pediatr,Current opinion in pediatrics,9000850,,IM,"['Animals', 'Brain Neoplasms/drug therapy/radiotherapy/surgery/*therapy', 'Child', 'Ependymoma/therapy', 'Glioma/diagnosis/radiotherapy', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/epidemiology', 'Radiotherapy/adverse effects', 'Radiotherapy Dosage', 'Survivors']",2007/11/21 09:00,2008/02/26 09:00,['2007/11/21 09:00'],"['2007/11/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/26 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/MOP.0b013e3282f0eafa [doi]', '00008480-200712000-00011 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Opin Pediatr. 2007 Dec;19(6):670-4. doi: 10.1097/MOP.0b013e3282f0eafa.,,,,,,,,31,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Understanding these interactions between various predisposing genes for the risk of developing childhood leukemia is of considerable importance. CYP2E1 is a susceptible gene in this respect, especially for its capacity to bioactivate many procarcinogens including benzene and N-nitrosodimethylamine. The CYP2E1 gene possesses several polymorphisms in humans, and among them, CYP2E1*5B and *6 have been shown to be associated with increased risks of several chemical-induced diseases. There are limited and contradictory data on the association between the CYP2E1*5B variant allele and childhood ALL, and none on such associations of CYP2E1*6 and*7B variant alleles. The aim of this study was to investigate the possible association of CYP2E1*5B, *6 and *7B alleles, alone or in combination, with the risk of incidence of childhood ALL in a Turkish population. METHODS: The genotypes for both polymorphisms were determined by polymerase chain reaction/restriction fragment length polymorphism techniques on 207 healthy controls and 168 patients. RESULTS: Neither locus was associated with the occurrence of childhood ALL. On the other hand, when both CYP2E1*5B and *6 alleles were considered together, the risk of childhood ALL increased significantly (2.9-fold; OR = 2.9, 95% CI 1.0-8.5; p < 0.05). Moreover, the presence of at least 2 variant alleles of any combination increased the risk significantly 3.9 times, suggesting a combined effect (OR = 3.9, 95% CI 1.4-11.0). CONCLUSION: Individuals carrying combinations of CYP2E1*5B, *6 and *7B variants together are likely associated with the risk of developing childhood ALL.","['Ulusoy, Gulen', 'Adali, Orhan', 'Tumer, Tugba Boyunegmez', 'Sahin, Gurses', 'Gozdasoglu, Sevgi', 'Arinc, Emel']","['Ulusoy G', 'Adali O', 'Tumer TB', 'Sahin G', 'Gozdasoglu S', 'Arinc E']","['Biochemistry Graduate Programme and Department of Biological Sciences, Middle East Technical University, Ankara, Turkey. gulusoy@metu.edu.tr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071115,Switzerland,Oncology,Oncology,0135054,['EC 1.14.13.- (Cytochrome P-450 CYP2E1)'],IM,"['Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2E1/*genetics', 'Female', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/ethnology/*genetics', 'Risk Factors', 'Turkey']",2007/11/21 09:00,2008/01/03 09:00,['2007/11/21 09:00'],"['2007/06/06 00:00 [received]', '2007/06/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/11/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/03 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['000111131 [pii]', '10.1159/000111131 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncology. 2007;72(1-2):125-31. doi: 10.1159/000111131.

The BH3-only protein Nbk/Bik induces cell death via an entirely Bax-dependent/Bak-independent mechanism. In contrast, cell death induced by the short splice variant of Bcl-x depends on Bak but not Bax. This indicates that Bak is functional but fails to become activated by Nbk. Here, we show that binding of myeloid cell leukemia 1 (Mcl-1) to Bak persists after Nbk expression and inhibits Nbk-induced apoptosis in Bax-deficient cells. In contrast, the BH3-only protein Puma disrupts Mcl-1-Bak interaction and triggers cell death via both Bax and Bak. Targeted knockdown of Mcl-1 overcomes inhibition of Bak and allows for Bak activation by Nbk. Thus, Nbk is held in check by Mcl-1 that interferes with activation of Bak. The finding that different BH3-only proteins rely specifically on Bax, Bak, or both has important implications for the design of anticancer drugs targeting Bcl-2.","['Gillissen, Bernhard', 'Essmann, Frank', 'Hemmati, Philipp G', 'Richter, Antje', 'Richter, Anja', 'Oztop, Ilker', 'Chinnadurai, Govindaswamy', 'Dorken, Bernd', 'Daniel, Peter T']","['Gillissen B', 'Essmann F', 'Hemmati PG', 'Richter A', 'Richter A', 'Oztop I', 'Chinnadurai G', 'Dorken B', 'Daniel PT']","['Department of Hematology, Oncology, and Tumor Immunology, University Medical Center Charite, 13125 Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Cell Biol,The Journal of cell biology,0375356,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BIK protein, human)', '0 (Benzimidazoles)', '0 (Carbocyanines)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Mitochondrial Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', ""21527-78-6 (5,5',6,6'-tetrachloro-1,1',3,3'-tetraethylbenzimidazolocarbocyanine)"", '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)']",IM,"['Adenoviridae/genetics', '*Apoptosis/genetics/physiology', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/*metabolism', 'Benzimidazoles', 'Carbocyanines', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Membrane Permeability', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'HCT116 Cells', 'Humans', 'Kidney/cytology', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins/*metabolism', 'Mitochondria/physiology', 'Mitochondrial Proteins', 'Models, Biological', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Transgenes', 'bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/genetics/*metabolism']",2007/11/21 09:00,2007/12/19 09:00,['2007/11/21 09:00'],"['2007/11/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/19 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['jcb.200703040 [pii]', '10.1083/jcb.200703040 [doi]']",ppublish,J Cell Biol. 2007 Nov 19;179(4):701-15. doi: 10.1083/jcb.200703040.,,['R01 CA033616/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,PMC2080900,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Is9131, displayed wide cytotoxicity in human tumor cell lines with an average IC(50) of 0.905 micromol/L. Notably, MFTZ-1 showed significant cytotoxicity in the three multidrug resistance cell lines with an average resistance factor of 2.08. The in vivo experiments showed that MFTZ-1 had inhibitory effects on the human ovarian carcinoma HO-8910 cell line xenotransplanted in nude mice. Further studies showed that MFTZ-1 induced DNA double-strand breaks and triggered mitochondria-dependent apoptosis in human leukemia HL-60 cells. Using a yeast genetic system, we found that topoisomerase (Topo) II rather than Topo I was the primary cellular target of MFTZ-1. Most importantly, MFTZ-1 functions as a novel nonintercalative Topo II poison via binding to ATPase of Topo II, characterized by its strong inhibition on the decatenation and relaxation of Topo II. The capacity of MFTZ-1 to stabilize Topo II-DNA covalent complexes was comparable with that of the classic Topo II poison, etoposide. Moreover, using a Topo II catalytic inhibitor aclarubicin and Topo II-deficient HL-60/MX2 cells, we further showed that MFTZ-1-triggered DNA double-strand breaks and apoptosis occurred in a Topo II-dependent manner. Together, the well-defined Topo II-poisoning function and the potent antitumor activity, with the appreciable anti-multidrug resistance action in particular, promises MFTZ-1 as a novel potential Topo II-targeted agent, which merits further research and development.","['Xie, Cheng-Ying', 'Zhu, Hong', 'Lin, Li-Ping', 'Miao, Ze-Hong', 'Geng, Mei-Yu', 'Cai, Yu-Jun', 'Chen, Yi', 'Zhao, Hua-Jun', 'Luo, Hai-Bin', 'Zhang, Xiong-Wen', 'Fan, Li-Ming', 'Shen, Yue-Mao', 'Ding, Jian']","['Xie CY', 'Zhu H', 'Lin LP', 'Miao ZH', 'Geng MY', 'Cai YJ', 'Chen Y', 'Zhao HJ', 'Luo HB', 'Zhang XW', 'Fan LM', 'Shen YM', 'Ding J']","['Division of Antitumor Pharmacology, State Key Laboratory of Drug Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 201203, P.R.

At physiological concentrations of retinoic acid, PML-RARalpha silences RARalpha target genes, blocking differentiation of the cells. At high concentrations of ligand, it (re)activates the transcription of target genes, forcing terminal differentiation. The study of RARalpha target genes that mediate this differentiation has identified several genes that are important for proliferation and differentiation control in normal and malignant hematopoietic cells. In this paper, we show that the PML-RARalpha fusion protein not only interferes with the transcription of regular RARalpha target genes. We show that the ID1 and ID2 promoters are activated by PML-RARalpha but, unexpectedly, not by wild-type RARalpha/RXR. Our data support a model in which the PML-RARalpha fusion protein regulates a novel class of target genes by interaction with the Sp1 and NF-Y transcription factors, without directly binding to the DNA, defining a gain-of-function for the oncoprotein.","['van Wageningen, Sake', 'Breems-de Ridder, Marleen C', 'Nigten, Jeannet', 'Nikoloski, Gorica', 'Erpelinck-Verschueren, Claudia A J', 'Lowenberg, Bob', 'de Witte, Theo', 'Tenen, Daniel G', 'van der Reijden, Bert A', 'Jansen, Joop H']","['van Wageningen S', 'Breems-de Ridder MC', 'Nigten J', 'Nikoloski G', 'Erpelinck-Verschueren CA', 'Lowenberg B', 'de Witte T', 'Tenen DG', 'van der Reijden BA', 'Jansen JH']","['Central Hematology Laboratory and Department of Hematology, Nijmegen Centre for Molecular Life Sciences, Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071119,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (CCAAT-Binding Factor)', '0 (ID1 protein, human)', '0 (Inhibitor of Differentiation Protein 1)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '0 (Retinoid X Receptors)', '0 (Sp1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['CCAAT-Binding Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Differentiation Protein 1/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/genetics/pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Protein Binding', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/genetics/metabolism', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'Retinoid X Receptors/genetics/metabolism', 'Sp1 Transcription Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation/drug effects/*genetics', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Up-Regulation']",2007/11/21 09:00,2008/03/28 09:00,['2007/11/21 09:00'],"['2007/11/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/28 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)45422-9 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2007-04-081125 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2008 Feb 1;111(3):1634-43. doi: 10.1182/blood-2007-04-081125.

We demonstrate that siRNA screening can identify tyrosine kinase targets containing activating mutations in Janus kinase (JAK) 3 (A572V) in CMK cells and c-KIT (V560G) in HMC1.1 cells. In addition, this assay identifies targets that do not contain mutations, such as JAK1 and the focal adhesion kinases (FAK), that are crucial to the survival of the cancer cells.

RESULTS: Girls napped more and had less fragmented night sleep than boys did. Wake time after sleep onset was sensitive to dexamethasone administration, revealing a differential direction of response for girls and boys. No gender differences were observed for subjective fatigue or daytime activity in the total sample. CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary findings support gender differences in the sleep of children with cancer after controlling for differences in age, treatment, and risk group.

However, the mechanism that regulates extrinsic signaling in ES cells is unknown. Heparan sulfate (HS) chains are ubiquitously present as the cell surface proteoglycans and are known to play crucial roles in regulating several signaling pathways. Here we investigated whether HS chains on ES cells are involved in regulating signaling pathways that are important for the maintenance of ES cells. RNA interference-mediated knockdown of HS chain elongation inhibited mouse ES cell self-renewal and induced spontaneous differentiation of the cells into extraembryonic endoderm.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A group of 2,503 survivors of childhood cancer diagnosed before their 16th birthday were studied with data from registers in a national cohort of 1.91 million Swedish residents. Disability indicators were created from information in national registers about income (sickness pension, handicap allowance), personal assistance, and family situation in 2002. Multivariate logistic regression on the log scale was used to estimate relative risk (RR) ratios. RESULTS: A total of 7.6% of survivors received handicap allowance indicating permanent disability, including brain tumors (14.0%), other solid tumors (6.3), and leukemias/lymphomas (2.9%), compared with 0.6% in the general population. Twenty-six percent of survivors of CNS tumor and 10% of survivors of solid tumors had at least one indication of a disability. Younger age at diagnosis suggested a higher risk for disability. CNS tumor survivors had an RR of 10.7 (95% CI, 9.3 to 12.8) for having at least one disability indication compared with the noncancer population, whereas leukemia and lymphoma survivors had an RR of 3.0, and survivors of other cancers had an RR of 3.8. Survivors of CNS tumor only had an increased RR for living in the parental household (RR = 1.6; 95% CI, 1.4 to 1.9). CONCLUSION: Childhood cancer survivors more often have persistent needs of supportive measures provided by community and/or the parental household. The survivors of CNS tumors were at particular risk, indicating a need of safer treatment protocols, and tailored follow-up, prevention, and rehabilitation to address this persistent social disability.","['Hjern, Anders', 'Lindblad, Frank', 'Boman, Krister K']","['Hjern A', 'Lindblad F', 'Boman KK']","[""Karolinska Institutet, Childhood Cancer Research Unit, Astrid Lindgren Children's Hospital Q6:05, 171 76 Stockholm, Sweden.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', '*Disabled Persons', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*mortality', '*Survivors']",2007/11/21 09:00,2007/12/07 09:00,['2007/11/21 09:00'],"['2007/11/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/07 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['25/33/5262 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2007.12.3802 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2007 Nov 20;25(33):5262-6. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2007.12.3802.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 68 children affected by de novo B-ALL enrolled onto the Berlin-Frankfurt-Muenster-based Italian Association of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology LNH-97 clinical protocol were studied. Bone marrow aspirate from each patient was analyzed for the presence of t(8;14)(q24;q32) by long-distance polymerase chain reaction at diagnosis, after the first chemotherapy cycle, and after subsequent cycles until negative for MRD. Morphologic and immunophenotypic analyses were reviewed centrally. RESULTS: A total of 47 patients (69%) were positive for t(8;14)(q24;q32). MRD response kinetics was determined in 39 patients. All of them reached clinical complete remission and most (31 of 39) became MRD negative after the first chemotherapy cycle. The 3-year relapse-free survival (RFS) was 38% (SE = 17%) in patients MRD positive after the first chemotherapy cycle compared with 84% (SE = 7%) in MRD-negative patients (P = .0005), whereas there was no difference in RFS for children who reached a clinical complete remission after the first chemotherapy cycle versus those who did not (RFS = 72% and SE = 9%; RFS = 79% and SE = 11%, respectively; P = .8). In multivariate analysis, MRD was shown to be predictive of higher risk of failure. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated that MRD carries a negative prognostic impact in B-ALL patients and suggests that a better risk-adapted therapy, possibly including the use of anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, should be considered in selected patients.","['Mussolin, Lara', 'Pillon, Marta', 'Conter, Valentino', 'Piglione, Matilde', 'Lo Nigro, Luca', 'Pierani, Paolo', 'Micalizzi, Concetta', 'Buffardi, Salvatore', 'Basso, Giuseppe', 'Zanesco, Luigi', 'Rosolen, Angelo']","['Mussolin L', 'Pillon M', 'Conter V', 'Piglione M', 'Lo Nigro L', 'Pierani P', 'Micalizzi C', 'Buffardi S', 'Basso G', 'Zanesco L', 'Rosolen A']","['Clinica di Oncoematologia Pediatrica, Azienda Ospedaliera-Universita di Padova, Via Giustiniani 3, 35128 Padova, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,['EC 1.1.1.27 (L-Lactate Dehydrogenase)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/drug therapy/genetics/*mortality', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'L-Lactate Dehydrogenase/blood', 'Male', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/genetics/*mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', '*Translocation, Genetic']",2007/11/21 09:00,2007/12/07 09:00,['2007/11/21 09:00'],"['2007/11/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/07 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['25/33/5254 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2007.11.3159 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2007 Nov 20;25(33):5254-61. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2007.11.3159.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We recently have identified the heat shock protein 32 (Hsp32)/heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) as a BCR/ABL-dependent survival molecule in CML cells. We here show that silencing Hsp32/HO-1 in CML cells by an siRNA approach results in induction of apoptosis. Moreover, targeting Hsp32/HO-1 by either pegylated zinc protoporphyrine (PEG-ZnPP) or styrene maleic acid-micelle-encapsulated ZnPP (SMA-ZnPP) resulted in growth inhibition of BCR/ABL-transformed cells. The effects of PEG-ZnPP and SMA-ZnPP were demonstrable in Ba/F3 cells carrying various imatinib-resistant mutants of BCR/ABL, including the T315I mutant, which exhibits resistance against all clinically available BCR/ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Growth-inhibitory effects of PEG-ZnPP and SMA-ZnPP also were observed in the CML-derived human cell lines K562 and KU812 as well as in primary leukemic cells obtained from patients with freshly diagnosed CML or imatinib-resistant CML. Finally, Hsp32/HO-1-targeting compounds were found to synergize with either imatinib or nilotinib in producing growth inhibition in imatinib-resistant K562 cells and in Ba/F3 cells harboring the T315I mutant of BCR/ABL. In summary, these data show that HO-1 is a promising novel target in imatinib-resistant CML.","['Mayerhofer, Matthias', 'Gleixner, Karoline V', 'Mayerhofer, Julia', 'Hoermann, Gregor', 'Jaeger, Eva', 'Aichberger, Karl J', 'Ott, Rene G', 'Greish, Khaled', 'Nakamura, Hideaki', 'Derdak, Sophia', 'Samorapoompichit, Puchit', 'Pickl, Winfried F', 'Sexl, Veronika', 'Esterbauer, Harald', 'Schwarzinger, Ilse', 'Sillaber, Christian', 'Maeda, Hiroshi', 'Valent, Peter']","['Mayerhofer M', 'Gleixner KV', 'Mayerhofer J', 'Hoermann G', 'Jaeger E', 'Aichberger KJ', 'Ott RG', 'Greish K', 'Nakamura H', 'Derdak S', 'Samorapoompichit P', 'Pickl WF', 'Sexl V', 'Esterbauer H', 'Schwarzinger I', 'Sillaber C', 'Maeda H', 'Valent P']","['Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria. mathias.mayerhofer@meduniwien.ac.at']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071116,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 1.14.14.18 (HMOX1 protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.14.18 (Heme Oxygenase-1)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Bone Marrow Cells/drug effects/pathology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Heme Oxygenase-1/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/enzymology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2007/11/21 09:00,2008/05/22 09:00,['2007/11/21 09:00'],"['2007/11/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/22 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)44618-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2006-11-055723 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2008 Feb 15;111(4):2200-10. doi: 10.1182/blood-2006-11-055723.

We hypothesized that disruption of leukemic cell cytoskeletal stability and interference with vascular cell interactions would promote leukemic cell death. We demonstrate that low and nontoxic doses of microtubule-destabilizing agent combretastatin-A4-phosphate (CA4P) inhibit leukemic cell proliferation in vitro and induce mitotic arrest and cell death. Treatment of acute myeloid leukemias (AMLs) with CA4P leads to disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential, release of proapoptotic mitochondrial membrane proteins, and DNA fragmentation, resulting in cell death in part through a caspase-dependent manner. Furthermore, CA4P increases intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), and antioxidant treatment imparts partial protection from cell death, suggesting that ROS accumulation contributes to CA4P-induced cytotoxicity in AML. In vivo, CA4P inhibited proliferation and circulation of leukemic cells and diminished the extent of perivascular leukemic infiltrates, prolonging survival of mice that underwent xenotransplantation without inducing hematologic toxicity. CA4P decreases the interaction of leukemic cells with neovessels by down-regulating the expression of the adhesion molecule VCAM-1 thereby augmenting leukemic cell death. These data suggest that CA4P targets both circulating and vascular-adherent leukemic cells through mitochondrial damage and down-regulation of VCAM-1 without incurring hematologic toxicities. As such, CA4P provides for an effective means to treat refractory organ-infiltrating leukemias.","['Petit, Isabelle', 'Karajannis, Matthias A', 'Vincent, Loic', 'Young, Lauren', 'Butler, Jason', 'Hooper, Andrea T', 'Shido, Koji', 'Steller, Hermann', 'Chaplin, David J', 'Feldman, Eric', 'Rafii, Shahin']","['Petit I', 'Karajannis MA', 'Vincent L', 'Young L', 'Butler J', 'Hooper AT', 'Shido K', 'Steller H', 'Chaplin DJ', 'Feldman E', 'Rafii S']","['Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Ansary Center for Stem Cell Therapeutics, Department of Genetic Medicine, Division of Hematology-Oncology, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071116,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Annexin A5)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Stilbenes)', 'I5590ES2QZ (fosbretabulin)']",IM,"['Annexin A5/drug effects/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Death/*drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'DNA Damage/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Lymphoma/drug therapy/pathology', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/*physiology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Stilbenes/*pharmacology', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2007/11/21 09:00,2008/05/22 09:00,['2007/11/21 09:00'],"['2007/11/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/22 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)44589-6 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2007-05-089219 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2008 Feb 15;111(4):1951-61. doi: 10.1182/blood-2007-05-089219.

A global view of PML-RARalpha transcriptional functions was obtained by genome-wide binding and chromatin modification analyses combined with genome-wide expression data. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-chip experiments identified 372 direct genomic PML-RARalpha targets. A subset of these was confirmed in primary acute promyelocytic leukemia. Direct PML-RARalpha targets include regulators of global transcriptional programs as well as critical regulatory genes for basic cellular functions such as cell-cycle control and apoptosis. PML-RARalpha binding universally led to HDAC1 recruitment, loss of histone H3 acetylation, increased tri-methylation of histone H3 lysine 9, and unexpectedly increased trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 4. The binding of PML-RARalpha to target promoters and the resulting histone modifications resulted in mRNA repression of functionally relevant genes. Taken together, our results reveal that the transcription factor PML-RARalpha regulates key cancer-related genes and pathways by inducing a repressed chromatin formation on its direct genomic target genes.","['Hoemme, Claudia', 'Peerzada, Abdul', 'Behre, Gerhard', 'Wang, Yipeng', 'McClelland, Michael', 'Nieselt, Kay', 'Zschunke, Matthias', 'Disselhoff, Christine', 'Agrawal, Shuchi', 'Isken, Fabienne', 'Tidow, Nicola', 'Berdel, Wolfgang E', 'Serve, Hubert', 'Muller-Tidow, Carsten']","['Hoemme C', 'Peerzada A', 'Behre G', 'Wang Y', 'McClelland M', 'Nieselt K', 'Zschunke M', 'Disselhoff C', 'Agrawal S', 'Isken F', 'Tidow N', 'Berdel WE', 'Serve H', 'Muller-Tidow C']","['Department of Medicine, Hematology and Oncology and Interdisciplinary Center for Clinical Research (IZKF), University of Munster, Domagkstrasse 3, Munster, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20071116,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)']",IM,"['Chromatin/*metabolism', '*Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Genome, Human/genetics', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics/*pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/*metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Protein Binding', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'U937 Cells']",2007/11/21 09:00,2008/04/16 09:00,['2007/11/21 09:00'],"['2007/11/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/16 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)51570-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2007-03-079921 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2008 Mar 1;111(5):2887-95. doi: 10.1182/blood-2007-03-079921.

These neoplasms are thought to be the direct consequence of mutational events induced by cytotoxic therapy. Their outcomes have historically been poor compared with those of people who develop acute myeloid leukemia (AML) de novo. The question arises whether a diagnosis of t-AML per se indicates a poor prognosis, or whether their bad outcomes result from other clinical and biologic characteristics. Because of lingering damage from prior cytotoxic therapy and, in some cases, the persistence of their primary disorder, patients with t-AML are often poor candidates for intensive AML therapy. The spectrum of cytogenetic abnormalities in t-AML is similar to de novo AML, but the frequency of unfavorable cytogenetics, such as a complex karyotype or deletion or loss of chromosomes 5 and/or 7, is higher in t-AML. Survival varies according to cytogenetic risk group, with better outcomes observed in patients with t-AML with favorable-risk karyotypes. Treatment recommendations should be based on performance status and karyotype. Patients with t-AML should be enrolled on front-line chemotherapy trials, appropriate for de novo AML patients with similar disease characteristics. Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation can cure some patients with t-AML.

Those considered to be at high risk for relapse often are considered for HSCT in first complete remission (CR1) while those at lower risk may not be referred until they have relapsed, when their chances for cure are very poor. In some patients who have a suitable histocompatible sibling, disease- or patient-related factors may override the potential benefit of allogeneic HSCT. Because many patients do not have a suitable histocompatible sibling, one has to consider the relative merits of autologous transplantation versus use of an alternative allogeneic stem cell source, such as a matched-unrelated donor (MUD), umbilical cord blood (UCB) donor, or haploidentical donor. Deciding among these options in comparison to chemotherapy even in high-risk patients is difficult. In the review, the risks and benefits of these choices are discussed to determine whether and by what means to proceed to HSCT in adult patients with ALL who are in CR1.

In considering the next steps it is appropriate to exploit on the one hand knowledge of the molecular, immunophenotypic and biological characteristics of the disease and on the other the biology of the patient. The aim is to move towards a more targeted approach. Immunophenotyping has defined an adequate target (CD33) for antibody-directed treatment, although this is not leukemia specific. Monotherapy has produced important response rates in relapsed disease but it is unlikely to displace conventional chemotherapy. Several randomized trials of antibody directed chemotherapy in combination with chemotherapy nearing completion will establish the usefulness of this approach. In most patients a leukemia-specific immunophenotype can be characterized that can be used to monitor treatment. Minimal residual disease (MRD) detection in morphological remission can detect patients at high risk of relapse, as can a limited number of molecular markers. The clinical value of intervening at the time of MRD detection is not clear. Among the increasing molecular abnormalities described in AML, FLT-3 mutations appear the most attractive for therapeutic intervention. Several phase 2 studies have shown limited efficacy, and randomized trials in combination are underway. Other mechanisms that can be specifically targeted include farnesylation, methylation status, and histone deacelylation. Newer knowledge about the immunophenotypic and biological characteristics of the leukemic stem cell population has opened opportunities to develop treatments that exploit characteristics of the leukemic stem cells that differ from the normal stem cell. Some of these initiatives are now discussed.","['Burnett, Alan K', 'Knapper, Steve']","['Burnett AK', 'Knapper S']","['Heath Park, School of Medicine, Cardiff Univ., Cardiff CF4 4XN, United Kingdom. burnettak@cardiff.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Hematology Am Soc Hematol Educ Program,Hematology.

These patients are more likely to have comorbid illness, poor performance status, and impaired organ function. These clinical features limit their ability to tolerate intensive cytotoxic chemotherapy and result in greater early mortality. The AML seen in elderly patients is also more likely to have evolved from a prior hematologic disorder, and the leukemic blasts are more likely to have poor-risk structural and numeric cytogenetic abnormalities and expression of multidrug resistance protein (MDR1). These blast features have been associated with greater resistance to therapy. Attempts to improve outcome have generally been unsuccessful. Priming of leukemic blasts with granulocyte colony-stimulating factors during cytarabine therapy, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor support to speed neutrophil recovery following induction therapy, inhibition of the MDR1 p-glycoprotein efflux pump, the use of alternative anthracyclines, and the addition of high-dose cytarabine have all been investigated in the last three decades.

Although severe anemia contributes to symptoms of fatigue and reduced quality of life, transfusion dependence increases the risk of organ complications from iron overload coupled with an increased risk of leukemia transformation. Among World Health Organization categories without elevation in bone marrow myeloblasts, an incremental rise in RBC transfusion burden is associated with a proportionate reduction in both overall survival and leukemia-free survival, implying that anemia severity is an important variable limiting the otherwise favorable natural history of patients with lower risk disease. Moreover, therapeutic strategies that successfully restore effective erythropoiesis, such as erythropoetic stimulating agents, immunomodulatory agents, immunosuppressive therapies, or hypomethylating agents, may favorably affect the natural history of this disease, creating perhaps a new urgency for the initiation of erythropoietic promoters that have durable clinical benefit.

Milestone measurements up to 18 months of first-line imatinib therapy are prognostic and provide warning signals of suboptimal response. Serial measurements for patients with a complete cytogenetic response determine ongoing treatment efficacy or signal pending relapse. The pattern of molecular and cytogenetic response is generally comparable, but only cytogenetic analysis can monitor for the acquisition of clonal abnormalities and has an important role in case of loss of molecular response. For patients treated with imatinib, a rising level of BCR-ABL is a trigger for kinase domain mutation analysis. The characterization of BCR-ABL inhibitor-resistant mutations is important to direct therapeutic intervention because it is now apparent that each resistant mutation functions as a distinct protein with unique biological properties that may confer a gain or loss of function. The benefit to patients of regular molecular analysis is a reassurance of ongoing response using the most sensitive of techniques or a potential improvement in outcome for those where relapse is indicated early. However, despite the obvious benefits of molecular analysis, the measurement techniques may not be quite ready for acceptance into the routine clinical monitoring practices of all clinicians. The challenge now is to standardize and simplify the method so that it can be readily and reliably incorporated into routine laboratory testing procedures.","['Branford, Susan']",['Branford S'],"['Inst. of Medical and Veterinary Science, Frome Rd., Adelaide, SA 5000, Australia. susan.branford@imvs.sa.gov.au']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Hematology Am Soc Hematol Educ Program,Hematology.

Additional discovery of relevant molecular lesions (JAK2 exon 12 mutations and c-MplW515L/K) have only further enriched our understanding of MPD pathogenesis. The improved diagnostic certainty these molecular markers provide have resulted in the modification, and simplification, of the World Health Organization (WHO) diagnostic algorithms for MPDs. Despite these scientific advances, however, the initial management of MPDs continues to rely upon a risk-based strategy to minimize the risk of vascular events with control of erythrocytosis, targeted antiplatelet therapy, and risk-based myelosuppressive therapy. No current medical therapy has altered the natural trend of the MPDs to lead to overt severe myelofibrosis or acute leukemia. Investigations into targeted therapies for MPDs are proceeding at a brisk pace with agents aimed at immunomodulation, decreasing marrow stromal reaction to the aberrant clone, DNA hypomethylation, or the inhibition of tyrosine kinases. Specific inhibition of JAK2 itself appears promising by in vitro investigations, and clinical trials with multiple agents are planned to commence enrollment in 2007. The potential impact of JAK2 inhibitors on the manifestations of the MPDs is unclear, but is awaited with great interest.","['Mesa, Ruben A']",['Mesa RA'],"['Mayo Clinic, 200 First Street, SW, Rochester, MN 55902, USA. mesa.ruben@mayo.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Hematology Am Soc Hematol Educ Program,Hematology.

While some environmental factors (such as farming-related exposures and occupational chemicals) may increase risk of CLL, results of epidemiologic studies have been generally inconsistent. Rates of CLL in the population show significant international variation, with the highest rates in the U.S. and Europe and the lowest rates in Asia. Migrants from Asia to the U.S. also have low rates of CLL, which supports a greater role for genetic compared with environmental risk factors. Large, population-based case-control and cohort studies have also shown significant familial aggregation of CLL and related conditions including non-Hodgkin and Hodgkin lymphoma. Monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis also aggregates in families with CLL. However, the clinical implication of familial aggregation is minimal given the overall rarity of CLL. Linkage studies have been conducted in high-risk CLL families to screen the whole genome for loci that contribute to susceptibility, but no gene mutations have yet been identified by this method. Association studies of candidate genes have implicated immune function and other genes, but more studies are needed to verify these findings.

The recognition that different NHL subtypes require different treatment strategies was fundamental to developing successful therapy regimens. Currently established therapy groups are lymphoblastic lymphoma (LBL) of precursor B- or T-cell type, mature B-cell neoplasms (B-NHL), and anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL). Accurate diagnostic classification is crucial for allocating patients to appropriate treatment groups. Therapy protocols designed to treat children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) have proven highly efficacious for treating children with LBL and are associated with event-free survival (EFS) rates up to 80%. For children with B-NHL, a strategy of rapidly repeated short, dose-intense courses proved more efficacious, with EFS rates up to 90%. In patients with ALCL, comparable results are achieved with either strategy, although this group has the highest relapse rate. The price of these efficacious treatments is considerable toxicity. On the other hand, the chance to survive after relapse is still dismal due to the almost complete lack of established salvage regimen. Thus, refinement of the balance between treatment burden and individual patient risk for failure is a major future task.

Chemotherapy and anti-angiogenic drugs increase the thrombotic risk in patients with lymphomas, acute leukemias and multiple myeloma (MM). Patients with hematologic malignancies often present with a hypercoagulable state or chronic disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) in the absence of active thrombosis and/or bleeding. Malignant cell procoagulant properties, cytotoxic therapies, and concomitant infections are major determinants for clotting activation in hematologic malignancies. In acute leukemia, clinical manifestations range from localized venous or arterial thrombosis to a diffuse, life-threatening thrombohemorrhagic syndrome (THS). All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) has greatly improved the management of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), but has not significantly changed the rate of early hemorrhagic deaths and may actually promote thrombosis. Randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) of different prophylactic regimens to prevent VTE or THS in hematologic malignancies are urgently needed, particularly in patients with lymphoma or MM during chemotherapy and in patients with APL. Anticoagulant therapy is a particular challenge in patients with hematologic malignancies, since these patients are at very high risk for hemorrhage. No guidelines are available for the prophylaxis or treatment of VTE; extrapolations can be made from existing guidelines for management of patients with other malignancies; prolonged periods of treatment-induced thrombocytopenia in patients with hematologic malignancies, however, require a more judicious application of standard anticoagulant approaches.

While there are many thrombogenic factors shared by both solid tumors and leukemia, many additional prothrombotic features are present in leukemia. The prothrombotic factors include hyperleukocytosis, increased expression of tissue factor and its activation in leukemic cells, and the prothrombotic adverse effects of therapeutic agents and vascular access catheters. In addition, comorbid conditions including hereditary thrombophilia, infection, endothelial cell activation by cytokines, antiphospholipid syndrome and acquired activated protein C resistance are major contributory factors. Factors that increase the bleeding risk include thrombocytopenia, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and excessive fibrinolysis, which is enhanced by increased expression of Annexin II by leukemic cells.

Several pathophysiologic mechanisms are common to different HA. In this review three different hemolytic disorders will be discussed. In sickle cell disease and in beta-thalassemia, a thrombophilic status has been well documented as multifactorial involving hemostatic changes and activation of the coagulation cascade. Moreover, in such disorders, elevated levels of endothelial adhesion protein (ICAM-1, ELAM-1, VCAM-1, von Willebrand factor, and thrombomodulin) are often increased, suggesting that endothelial activation may be involved in vascular occlusion. As an additional mechanism of hypercoagulability in thalassemia, a procoagulant status of thalassemic red cells was recognized. The main clinical manifestation of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is HA, and the most common complications are thrombosis, pancytopenia, and myelodysplastic syndrome or acute leukemia. The intravascular hemolysis is explained by a deficiency of glycosil phosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored complement regulatory proteins such as CD59 and CD55 on the membrane of red blood cells (RBCs), but the mechanism responsible for the increased incidence of thrombotic events in PNH remains unclear. Recent advances have been made in understanding the coagulation involvement in a heterogeneous group of diseases, thrombotic microangiopathies (TMA) characterized by microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia due to platelet clumping in the microcirculation, leading to ischemic organ dysfunction with neurologic symptoms and renal impairment.","['Cappellini, Maria Domenica']",['Cappellini MD'],"['Fondazione Policlinico, Pad.

King Henry IV, part 1, I, 2.",47-54,"The recognition that the immune system can play a major role in the control and cure of transplantable disorders led to the development of reduced-intensity allogeneic transplantation. The notion is that a compromise can be made between the intensity of conditioning and the fostering of graft-versus-host disease/ graft-versus-leukemia (GVHD/GVL), allowing the use of less intense conditioning with concomitantly less intense immediate toxicity. Reduced-intensity conditioning regimens have allowed the application of transplantation to older patients and to patients with underlying medical problems that preclude full-dose transplantation. Clearly, in some settings in which dose intensity is important, reduced-intensity regimens are less useful. However, for diseases that are either indolent, highly susceptible to GVL, or under good control before entering transplantation, this approach appears to have substantial benefits. Although the therapy appears to be valuable, concerns about delayed immune reconstitution and GVHD remain.","['Antin, Joseph H']",['Antin JH'],"['Dana Farber Cancer Institute, 44 Binney St., Boston MA 02115, USA. jantin@partners.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Hematology Am Soc Hematol Educ Program,Hematology.

The relative risk of clonal neoplasms is very significantly increased in children and adults with inherited bone marrow failure syndromes as well. Until recently, the mechanisms underlying clonal evolution have been opaque, but a sufficient amount of evidence has now accumulated to support a model in which cells resistant to extracellular apoptotic cues are selected from the stem cell pool.

The conceptual work of William Dameshek in 1951 provided the basis for understanding MPD as a continuum of related syndromes, possibly with a common pathogenetic cause. Recognition of the clonal origin of peripheral blood cells in MPD in 1976 and the ability to grow erythroid colonies in vitro in the absence of added growth factors in 1974 initiated the search for genetic alterations that might be responsible for myeloproliferation. Mutations in the genes for the erythropoietin receptor, thrombopoietin and the von Hippel-Lindau protein were found to cause familial syndromes resembling MPD, but despite their phenotypic similarities, none of these mutations were later found in patients with the sporadic form of MPD. The discovery of activating mutations in the Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) in most patients with MPD has fully transformed and energized the MPD field. Sensitive assays for detecting the JAK2-V617F mutation have become an essential part of the diagnostic work-up, and JAK2 now constitutes a prime target for developing specific inhibitors for the treatment of patients with MPD. Despite this progress, many questions remain unsolved, including how a single JAK2 mutation causes three different MPD phenotypes, what other genes might be involved in the pathogenesis, and what are the factors determining the progression to acute leukemia.","['Skoda, Radek']",['Skoda R'],"['Department of Research, University Hospital Basel, Hebelstrasse 20, CH-4031 Basel, Switzerland. radek.skoda@unibas.ch']",['eng'],['Lecture'],,United States,Hematology Am Soc Hematol Educ Program,Hematology.

The identification of these genes elucidates molecular mechanisms of tumorigenesis. In this study, we identified avian leukosis virus (ALV) proviral integration sites in rapid-onset B cell lymphomas arising <12 weeks after infection of chicken embryos. By using inverse PCR, 28 unique viral integration sites were identified in rapid-onset tumors. Integrations in the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) promoter/enhancer region were observed in four different tumors, suggesting that this is a common integration site. These provirus integrations ranged from 217 to 2,584 bp upstream of the TERT transcription initiation site and were all in the opposite transcriptional orientation to TERT. Southern blots of tumor samples demonstrated that these integrations are clonal and therefore occurred early in the process of tumorigenesis. Real-time RT-PCR showed overexpression of TERT mRNA in tumors harboring viral integrations in the TERT promoter. Telomerase activity was also up-regulated in these tumors; however, telomere-length alterations were not detected. Furthermore, viral LTR sequences directly enhanced the expression of luciferase reporters containing the TERT promoter sequences. This study documents retroviral up-regulation of cellular TERT by insertional activation to initiate or enhance tumor progression.","['Yang, Feng', 'Xian, Rena R', 'Li, Yingying', 'Polony, Tatjana S', 'Beemon, Karen L']","['Yang F', 'Xian RR', 'Li Y', 'Polony TS', 'Beemon KL']","['Department of Biology, The Johns Hopkins University, 3400 North Charles Street, Baltimore, MD 21218, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071116,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Avian Leukosis/genetics/*virology', 'Avian Leukosis Virus/*genetics', 'Cell Transformation, Viral/*genetics', 'Chick Embryo', 'Chickens/genetics/*virology', 'Clone Cells/pathology/virology', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Genes, myb', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/enzymology/genetics/*veterinary/virology', '*Mutagenesis, Insertional', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proviruses/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Telomerase/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Terminal Repeat Sequences', 'Up-Regulation', 'Virus Integration/*genetics']",2007/11/21 09:00,2008/01/16 09:00,['2007/11/21 09:00'],"['2007/11/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/16 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['0709173104 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.0709173104 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2007 Nov 27;104(48):18952-7. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0709173104.

A Graft-vs.-Lymphoma (GvL) effect is present in most entities as evidenced by the generally lower relapse rates after allo-SCT and the results of donor lymphocyte infusions. Slowly proliferating diseases like chronic lymphocytic leukemia, indolent lymphomas, and some T-cell lymphomas are particularly sensitive to the effects of allogeneic T-cells while patients with Hodgkin's disease and aggressive lymphoma may need vigorous debulking before allo-SCT to achieve optimal results. Although reduced-intensity conditioning has lowered transplant-related mortality in most and improved survival in some sub-entities, relapse rates in patients with Hodgkin's disease and aggressive B-cell lymphomas, as well as in patients with heavily pre-treated and refractory lymphoma, remain high and further improvement is undoubtedly needed.

We have previously shown that extracellular thioredoxin protects B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells from apoptosis in vitro. In this study we were interested to determine whether thioredoxin is produced by cells surrounding the CLL cells in the in vivo microenvironment and whether this cell-derived thioredoxin has any leukemia growth-promoting effect in vitro. DESIGN AND METHODS: Lymph nodes from CLL patients (n=25) were analyzed for thioredoxin expression by immunohistology. Stromal cells purified from the lymph nodes were analyzed for thioredoxin secretion at the single cell level using an ELIspot assay. The survival effect of the stromal-derived thioredoxin was tested by co-culturing stromal- and CLL cells with and without Fab-fragments of an anti-thioredoxin antibody. RESULTS: The results indicated that the thioredoxin production correlated with the amount of proliferating cells and was mainly localized to the proliferation centers (pseudofollicles) in the CLL lymph nodes. The leukemia cells per se showed minimal thioredoxin levels; in contrast, stromal cells strongly expressed thioredoxin. Purified primary stromal cells, which secreted extracellular thioredoxin, significantly protected the CLL cells from undergoing apoptosis in 72 h co-cultures. Interestingly, this anti-apoptotic effect could be abrogated by addition of Fab-fragments of an anti- thioredoxin antibody. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, we have shown that stromal cells in the lymph node microenvironment produce thioredoxin and that the thioredoxin production is localized to the proliferation centers of the CLL lymph nodes. In addition, thioredoxin produced by purified stromal cells rescued CLL cells from apoptosis in vitro.","['Backman, Eva', 'Bergh, Ann-Charlotte', 'Lagerdahl, Irena', 'Rydberg, Bjorn', 'Sundstrom, Christer', 'Tobin, Gerard', 'Rosenquist, Richard', 'Linderholm, Mats', 'Rosen, Anders']","['Backman E', 'Bergh AC', 'Lagerdahl I', 'Rydberg B', 'Sundstrom C', 'Tobin G', 'Rosenquist R', 'Linderholm M', 'Rosen A']","['Department of Experimental Medicine, Division of Cell Biology, Linkoping University, SE-581 85 Linkoping, Sweden. eva.backman@ibk.liu.se']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,['52500-60-4 (Thioredoxins)'],IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/metabolism/*pathology', 'Lymph Nodes/*pathology', 'Stromal Cells/*chemistry/pathology', 'Thioredoxins/*analysis']",2007/11/21 09:00,2007/12/20 09:00,['2007/11/21 09:00'],"['2007/11/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/20 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['92/11/1495 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.11448 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2007 Nov;92(11):1495-504. doi: 10.3324/haematol.11448.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to characterize the involvement of Bcl-2 family members and caspase activation in dexamethasone(Dex)-induced apoptosis in ALL. DESIGN AND METHODS: Primary childhood ALL samples, the pre-B ALL cell line RS(4;11), and the T-ALL cell line CCRF-CEM were used. The involvement of Bcl-2 family members was evaluated by flow cytometry, immunocytochemistry, and western and northern blotting. Apoptosis was analyzed by annexin V and TMRE staining. Caspase activity was evaluated by a fluorometric assay. RESULTS: Dex induced significant down-regulation of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, differential activation of the pro-apoptotic Bak and Bax, loss of Delta psi m and cytochrome c release. Dex-induced apoptosis also involved early activation of caspases 2 and -3. Inhibition of caspase activity did not, however, protect against Dex-induced Bak/Bax activation, loss of Delta psi m or cell death. In 12 primary ALL samples Dex-induced apoptosis was associated with activation of Bax (p=0.045) and down-regulation of Bcl-2 (p=0.016) and/or Bcl-xL (p=0.004). Furthermore, ex vivo Dex-sensitivity was associated with an early treatment response to polychemotherapy (p=0.026).

The respective oncoprotein, KIT D816V, exhibits constitutive tyrosine kinase (TK) activity and has been implicated in malignant cell growth. Therefore, several attempts have been made to identify KIT D816V-targeting drugs. DESIGN AND METHODS: We examined the effects of the novel TK-inhibitor dasatinib alone and in combination with other targeted drugs on growth of neoplastic MC. RESULTS: Confirming previous studies, dasatinib was found to inhibit the TK activity of wild type (wt) KIT and KIT-D816V as well as growth and survival of neoplastic MC and of the MCL cell line, HMC-1. The growth-inhibitory effects of dasatinib in HMC-1 cells were found to be associated with a decrease in expression of CD2 and CD63. In addition, we found that dasatinib blocks KIT D816V-induced cluster-formation and viability in Ba/F3 cells. In drug combination experiments, dasatinib was found to co-operate with PKC412, AMN107, imatinib, and 2CdA in producing growth-inhibition and apoptosis in neoplastic MC. In HMC-1.1 cells lacking KIT D816V, all drug interactions were found to be synergistic in nature. By contrast, in HMC-1.2 cells exhibiting KIT D816V, only the combinations dasatinib+PKC412 and dasatinib+2CdA were found to produce synergistic effects.

The surface marker CD38 has roles in cell adhesion and signaling. Its expression correlates with poor clinical outcome and is associated with expression of the signaling intermediate ZAP-70, which is also a marker of poor prognosis. We investigated the regulation of CD38 and ZAP-70 in proliferating CLL cells. DESIGN AND METHODS: We cultured CLL cells on a stromal cell layer that maintains viability and also with some stromal cells expressing CD40 ligand (CD154) in order to measure changes in expression of CD38 and ZAP-70. RESULTS: We demonstrated up-regulation of CD38 expression by CD154. The degree of up-regulation did not correlate with clinical stage or mutational status. In addition in the majority of cases tested ZAP-70 expression increased in parallel with up-regulation of CD38 although discordant cases were also observed. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Overall we demonstrated that regulation of CD38 in CLL is dynamic and dependent on signals from CD154 and a stromal cell layer. We speculate that CD38 and ZAP-70 are expressed in lymph node leukemic cells in both good and poor prognosis patients, but, in cases with good clinical outcome, these molecules are down-regulated in the peripheral blood whereas in cases with poor prognosis their expression is maintained.","['Willimott, Shaun', 'Baou, Maria', 'Huf, Sarah', 'Deaglio, Silvia', 'Wagner, Simon D']","['Willimott S', 'Baou M', 'Huf S', 'Deaglio S', 'Wagner SD']","['Division of Investigative Sciences, Department of Haematology, Imperial College London, Hammersmith Hospital, Du Cane Road, London W12 0NN, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Antibodies)', '147205-72-9 (CD40 Ligand)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/immunology/*metabolism', 'Antibodies/immunology', 'CD40 Ligand/*pharmacology', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-4/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase/metabolism']",2007/11/21 09:00,2007/12/14 09:00,['2007/11/21 09:00'],"['2007/11/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/14 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['92/10/1359 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.11340 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2007 Oct;92(10):1359-66. doi: 10.3324/haematol.11340.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The BGMT 95 trial for older patients set out to improve the outcome of these patients by adding a third drug (lomustine) to a 5+7 idarubicin and cytarabine schedule at induction and evaluating intermediate-dose cytarabine as consolidation. DESIGN AND METHODS: A multicenter randomized trial was performed comparing induction therapy with idarubicin and cytarabine, 5+7 (IC) to induction therapy with the same drugs plus lomustine (CCNU), 200 mg\m(2) orally on day 1 (ICL). Patients in complete remission (CR) were then randomized to receive either maintenance therapy or intensification with intermediate-dose cytarabine and idarubicin followed by maintenance therapy. RESULTS: Between 1995 and 2001, 364 patients (>or=60 years) from ten centers were included. The CR rate was 58% for patients in the IC arm and 67% for patients in the ICL arm (p=0.104). The median overall survival (OS) was 7 and 12 months respectively (p=0.05), but OS at 2 years was not statistically different: 31+/-7% for patients in the ICL arm vs 24+/-6% for those in the IC arm. The two post-remission strategies yielded similar results.

Patients with acute leukemia often present with a hypercoagulable state or with evidence for chronic disseminated intravascular coagulation, even in the absence of active thrombosis and/or bleeding. Leukemic cell procoagulant properties, cytotoxic therapies, and concomitant infections are major determinants of clotting activation in acute leukemia. Clinical manifestations range from localized venous or arterial thrombosis to diffuse life-threatening bleeding. All-trans retinoic acid has greatly improved the management of acute promyelocytic leukemia, but has not significantly changed the rate of early hemorrhagic deaths and may actually promote thrombosis. Randomized, controlled trials of different prophylactic regimens to prevent thrombosis and/or bleeding in acute leukemia are urgently needed, particularly in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia. Anticoagulant therapy is a unique challenge in patients with acute leukemia, who are at high risk for hemorrhage. Although no guidelines are available for prophylaxis or treatment of thrombosis, extrapolation can be made from existing guidelines for management of patients with other malignancies prolonged periods of treatment-induced thrombocytopenia in patients with acute leukemia, however, require a more judicious application of standard anticoagulant approaches. Use of the newer anticoagulants will require careful assessment of hemorrhagic risk in this group of high risk patients but may be justified under special circumstances.","['Rickles, Frederick R', 'Falanga, Anna', 'Montesinos, Pau', 'Sanz, Miguel A', 'Brenner, Benjamin', 'Barbui, Tiziano']","['Rickles FR', 'Falanga A', 'Montesinos P', 'Sanz MA', 'Brenner B', 'Barbui T']","['George Washington University, Washington, DC, USA, Nobis, Fall Church, VA, USA. frederick.rickles@noblis.org']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Thromb Res,Thrombosis research,0326377,"['0 (Anticoagulants)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Anticoagulants/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects', 'Hemorrhage/*etiology/prevention & control/therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*complications/drug therapy', 'Thrombosis/*etiology/prevention & control/therapy']",2007/11/21 09:00,2009/01/23 09:00,['2007/11/21 09:00'],"['2007/11/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/23 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0049-3848(07)70137-8 [pii]', '10.1016/S0049-3848(07)70137-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Thromb Res. 2007;120 Suppl 2:S99-106. doi: 10.1016/S0049-3848(07)70137-8.,,,,['Thromb Res. 2008;123(1):187-90'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The enzyme also releases angiogenic factors from the ECM and thereby induces an angiogenic response in vivo. Heparanase is preferentially expressed in human tumors and its over-expression in tumor cells confers an accelerated growth and invasive phenotype in experimental animals. In contrast, heparanase gene silencing is associated with a marked inhibition of tumor progression. Heparanase upregulation correlates with increased tumor vascularity and poor postoperative survival of cancer patients. Studies on relationships between structure and the heparanase-inhibiting activity of nonanticogulant heparins systematically differing in their O-sulfation patterns, degrees of N-acetylation, and glycol-splitting of nonsulfated uronic acid residues, have permitted to select effective inhibitors of the enzymatic activity of heparanase. N-acetylated, glycol-split heparins emerged as highly effective and specific inhibitors of heparanase and tumor growth and metastasis. Several observations support the involvement of heparanase in haemostasis. A marked induction of tissue factor (TF) was noted in response to heparanase over-expression in tumor-derived cell lines and heparanase over-expressing transgenic mice. A direct correlation was also found between heparanase and TF expression levels in leukemia patients. TF induction was even more pronounced upon exogenous addition of heparanase to primary endothelial cells that do not normally express TF, and this induction was associated with enhanced coagulation. These and other results indicate that pro-heparanase is rapidly tethered on cell surfaces, partially depending on cell surface heparan sulfate, generating a local procoagulant effect. In addition, pro-heparanase can reverse the anti-coagulant effect of unfractionated heparin and the Factor Xa inhibitory activity of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH). These effects were also demonstrated in plasma derived from patients treated with LMWH. The pro-coagulant effects of pro-heparanase were also exerted by a peptide corresponding to its major functional heparin-binding domain. Heparanase pro-coagulant activities suggest its possible role as a natural regulator of heparinoid anti-coagulant activities, and point to a possible use of this molecule or its heparin binding domain as antidote for heparinoid therapies.","['Vlodavsky, Israel', 'Ilan, Neta', 'Nadir, Yona', 'Brenner, Benjamin', 'Katz, Ben-Zion', 'Naggi, Annamaria', 'Torri, Giangiacomo', 'Casu, Benito', 'Sasisekharan, Ram']","['Vlodavsky I', 'Ilan N', 'Nadir Y', 'Brenner B', 'Katz BZ', 'Naggi A', 'Torri G', 'Casu B', 'Sasisekharan R']","['Cancer and Vascular and Biology Research Center, The Bruce Rappaport Faculty of Medicine, Technion, Haifa, Israel.

However, because of unknown risk factors, severe pancreatitis sometimes occurs in patients receiving ASNase. We assessed the effect of ASNase on pancreatic acinar cells and then investigated the preventive effects of octreotide against ASNase-induced pancreatic injury in rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Rats received intraperitoneal injections of an Escherichia coli ASNase solution (200, 500, or 1000 IU/kg) or normal saline as a control every 24 hours for 5 days. Octreotide (3 microg/kg) was injected subcutaneously with ASNase (1000 IU/kg) every 8 hours for 5 days. Rats were sacrificed 24 hours after the last injection of ASNase or normal saline. RESULTS: Only the rats given 1000 IU/kg ASNase had significantly increased levels of pancreatic amylase (1962 +/- 152 vs 2179 +/- 84 IU/L, p < 0.01), trypsin (27.3 +/- 3.6 vs 41.1 +/- 22.8 IU/L, p < 0.05), and pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor (0.03 +/- 0.09 vs 0.27 +/- 0.10 ng/mL, p < 0.01) as compared to the control group. In addition, the acinar cells showed histological damage; however, octreotide injection provided protection against histological damage and the pancreatic enzymes remained within normal limits. CONCLUSIONS: Although ASNase by itself did not cause pancreatitis, it did cause increased levels of pancreatic enzymes and histological damage to the pancreas associated with pancreatic injury or pre-pancreatitis. Prior treatment with octreotide prevented the development of ASNase-induced pancreatic injury.","['Suzuki, Mitsuyoshi', 'Shimizu, Toshiaki', 'Kudo, Takahiro', 'Shoji, Hiromichi', 'Ohtsuka, Yoshikazu', 'Yamashiro, Yuichiro']","['Suzuki M', 'Shimizu T', 'Kudo T', 'Shoji H', 'Ohtsuka Y', 'Yamashiro Y']","['Department of Pediatrics, Juntendo University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan. f-mitsuo@zc5.so-net.ne.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20071126,Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Escherichia coli Proteins)', '0 (Gastrointestinal Agents)', '0 (Trypsin Inhibitors)', 'EC 3.2.1.- (Amylases)', 'EC 3.4.21.4 (Trypsin)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'RWM8CCW8GP (Octreotide)']",IM,"['Amylases/blood', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects/pharmacology', 'Asparaginase/*adverse effects/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Escherichia coli Proteins/adverse effects/pharmacology', 'Gastrointestinal Agents/*pharmacology', 'Male', 'Octreotide/*pharmacology', 'Pancreas/injuries/pathology', 'Pancreatitis/blood/*chemically induced/pathology/*prevention & control', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Trypsin/blood', 'Trypsin Inhibitors/blood']",2007/11/21 09:00,2008/03/26 09:00,['2007/11/21 09:00'],"['2007/05/22 00:00 [received]', '2007/09/10 00:00 [revised]', '2007/09/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/11/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/26 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-472X(07)00576-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2007.09.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2008 Feb;36(2):172-80. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2007.09.005.

While receptor interference by the Fv-4 env gene product, Fv-4 Env, that can bind to the ecotropic MLV receptor has been shown to play an important role in the resistance, other mechanisms have also been suggested because it confers extremely efficient, complete resistance in vivo. Here, we have examined the effect of Fv-4 Env on infectious MLV production. Infectious MLV titers in supernatants obtained after transfection with a Friend MLV (FMLV) Env-expressing plasmid from MLV gag-pol producer cells harboring a retroviral vector were largely reduced by coexpression of Fv-4 Env. Syncytia formation mediated by R-peptide-deleted FMLV Env in NIH 3T3 cells was impaired by Fv-4 Env coexpression. Similarly, Fv-4 Env inhibited infectious amphotropic MLV production and syncytia formation mediated by R-peptide-deleted amphotropic MLV Env. Immunoprecipitation analysis revealed interaction of Fv-4 Env with amphotropic MLV Env as well as FMLV Env. These results indicate that Fv-4 Env inhibits infectious ecotropic and amphotropic MLV production by exerting dominant negative effect on MLV Env, suggesting contribution of this inhibitory effect to the resistance against ecotropic MLV infection in Fv-4-expressing mice.","['Takeda, Akiko', 'Matano, Tetsuro']","['Takeda A', 'Matano T']","['International Research Center for Infectious Diseases, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, 4-6-1 Shirokanedai, Minato-ku, Tokyo 108-8639, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20070923,France,Microbes Infect,Microbes and infection,100883508,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Fv4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'DNA, Viral/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Products, env/genetics/*metabolism', 'Giant Cells/metabolism', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/drug effects/*metabolism/*pathogenicity', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/*metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Transfection', 'Virion/metabolism']",2007/11/21 09:00,2008/03/05 09:00,['2007/11/21 09:00'],"['2007/08/05 00:00 [received]', '2007/09/07 00:00 [revised]', '2007/09/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/11/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/05 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1286-4579(07)00303-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.micinf.2007.09.012 [doi]']",ppublish,Microbes Infect. 2007 Nov-Dec;9(14-15):1590-6. doi: 10.1016/j.micinf.2007.09.012.

(Papaveraceae), were compared. Both alkaloids induced apoptosis in human acute T-lymphoblastic leukaemia MT-4 cells. Apoptosis induction by CHE and SAN in these cells was accompanied by caspase-9 and -3 activation and an increase in the pro-apoptotic Bax protein. An elevation in the percentage of MT-4 cells possessing caspase-3 in active form after their treatment with CHE or SAN was in parallel to a corresponding increase in the fraction of apoptotic cells. The involvement of mitochondria in apoptosis induction by both alkaloids was supported by cytochrome C elevation in cytosol, with an accompanying decrease in cytochrome C content in the mitochondrial fraction.

However, their susceptibility to virus contamination is a potential risk to patient safety and productivity, and has led to the development of a repertoire of virus inactivation techniques. From a process development viewpoint, the challenge is to demonstrate the required log reduction in virus content without a significant loss in product titer or quality. The balance between the two is dictated by the kinetics of virus inactivation and protein degradation, both of which are critically affected by process parameters. In this study we describe a commercially available microchannel reactor (MCR) and demonstrate how it can be used to evaluate the impact of temperature on the kinetics of virus inactivation and protein product degradation. Virus spiking experiments are reported using Xenotropic Murine Leukemia Virus and REOvirus, into buffers in the absence and presence of a therapeutic protein currently under development at Lilly. The results demonstrate that the MCR is an ideal platform for evaluation of fast reactive systems and reactions that are particularly sensitive to small changes to process conditions. These conditions include heat inactivation of a virus in a mammalian cell culture process stream used in the manufacture of therapeutic proteins and antibodies.","['Bailey, Mark R', 'Chen, Dayue', 'Emery, Warren R', 'Lambooy, Peter K', 'Nolting, Juliana', 'Quertinmont, Michelle T', 'Shamlou, Parviz A']","['Bailey MR', 'Chen D', 'Emery WR', 'Lambooy PK', 'Nolting J', 'Quertinmont MT', 'Shamlou PA']","['Bioprocess Research and Development, Lilly Research Labs, Eli Lilly & Co, Indianapolis, Indiana, USA.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Biotechnol Bioeng,Biotechnology and bioengineering,7502021,,IM,"['Bioreactors/*virology', 'Cell Culture Techniques/*instrumentation/methods', 'Equipment Design', 'Equipment Failure Analysis', 'Heating/*instrumentation/methods', 'Kinetics', 'Microfluidics/*instrumentation/methods', 'Sterilization/*instrumentation/methods', '*Virus Inactivation']",2007/11/21 09:00,2008/03/28 09:00,['2007/11/21 09:00'],"['2007/11/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/28 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/21 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/bit.21714 [doi]'],ppublish,Biotechnol Bioeng. 2008 Apr 15;99(6):1384-91. doi: 10.1002/bit.21714.,,,,,,,,,,"['Copyright 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients with ATLL commonly present with leukemic changes, systemic lymphadenopathy, and/or extranodal lesion and have very poor prognosis. METHODS AND RESULTS: We describe a rare case of ATLL presenting as an isolated paranasal mass. Southern blot analysis of the biopsied specimens demonstrated multiple integration bands of HTLV-1 provirus of different intensities. Chemotherapy resulted in complete resolution of the paranasal mass. Thereafter, the patient showed an indolent clinical course with leukemic changes and pulmonary and cutaneous ATLL lesions and remains alive more than 5 years from diagnosis. CONCLUSION: ATLL should be included in the differential diagnosis of sinonasal lymphoma, although the event is rare. Multiple HTLV-1 provirus integrations of different intensities may be indicative of good prognosis for ATLL.","['Nagasaki, Akitoshi', 'Miyagi, Takashi', 'Taira, Tamiko', 'Shinhama, Akihiko', 'Kojya, Shizuo', 'Suzuki, Mikio', 'Aonahata, Miyuki', 'Yoshimi, Naoki', 'Takasu, Nobuyuki']","['Nagasaki A', 'Miyagi T', 'Taira T', 'Shinhama A', 'Kojya S', 'Suzuki M', 'Aonahata M', 'Yoshimi N', 'Takasu N']","['Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Internal Medicine, University of the Ryukyus School of Medicine, Okinawa, Japan. anaga@ryudai2nai.com']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Head Neck,Head & neck,8902541,,IM,"['Adult', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*diagnosis/therapy/virology', 'Male', 'Paranasal Sinus Neoplasms/*diagnosis/therapy/virology', 'Proviruses/*physiology', 'Virus Integration']",2007/11/21 09:00,2008/10/10 09:00,['2007/11/21 09:00'],"['2007/11/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/10 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/21 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/hed.20730 [doi]'],ppublish,Head Neck. 2008 Jun;30(6):815-20. doi: 10.1002/hed.20730.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PROCEDURE: Registry-based experience in England, Scotland and Wales over a 20-year period was studied to address these shortfalls. Anaplastic large cell lymphoma and mycosis fungoides were excluded due to recent publications describing UK experience with these disorders. RESULTS: Twenty-five cases were identified, comprising 1.6% of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) registrations; 17 (68%) children with PTCL-unspecified (PTCL-u), 3 (12%) with angiocentric PTCL, 3 (12%) with angioimmunoblastic PTCL, and 2 (8%) with subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma. Eighteen children were male, with a male/female ratio of 2.6:1. Median age was 7 (range 1-14) years. Eleven children (44%) died and actuarial survival was 76% at 1 year, 64% at 3 years and 59% at 5 years. Treatments given were subdivided between group T (regimens for T NHL or acute lymphoblastic leukaemia) or group B (regimens for B NHL). Amongst the 17 children with PTCL-u, 9/12 children in group T survived compared with 1/5 group B. CONCLUSIONS: The Children's Cancer and Leukaemia Group recommendation that children with PTCL-u receive group T therapy is supported by this series. The numbers of children with other types of PTCL were too small to allow conclusions on best therapy.","['Windsor, Rachael', 'Stiller, Charles', 'Webb, David']","['Windsor R', 'Stiller C', 'Webb D']","['Department of Haematology and Oncology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children, London, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell, Peripheral/*drug therapy/epidemiology/pathology', 'Male', 'Registries', 'Treatment Outcome', 'United Kingdom/epidemiology']",2007/11/21 09:00,2008/03/26 09:00,['2007/11/21 09:00'],"['2007/11/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/26 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/21 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.21293 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2008 Apr;50(4):784-7. doi: 10.1002/pbc.21293.,,,,,,,,,,"['(c) 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

TEL is modified by SUMOylation, and the lysine (Lys 99) that is conjugated to SUMO is required for TEL nuclear export. In addition, TEL is phosphorylated by p38 kinase, which is activated by cellular stress. Induction of cellular stress reduced the ability of TEL to repress transcription in vitro, but the mechanistic basis of this phenomenon was unclear. In this study, we show that osmotic stress causes re-localization of TEL to the cytoplasm and that p38-mediated phosphorylation of TEL is sufficient for this re-localization. However, impairment of both SUMOylation of Lys 99 and p38-dependent phosphorylation of Ser 257 of TEL were required to impair the re-localization of TEL in response to cellular stress induced by high salt, identifying two separate nuclear export pathways. Thus, alteration of the cellular localization of TEL may be a part of the cellular stress response and re-localization of TEL to the cytoplasm is an important step in the regulation of TEL.","['Hanson, Caroline A', 'Wood, Lauren D', 'Hiebert, Scott W']","['Hanson CA', 'Wood LD', 'Hiebert SW']","['Department of Biochemistry, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, Tennessee 37232, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,"['0 (ETS translocation variant 6 protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Small Ubiquitin-Related Modifier Proteins)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', '*Active Transport, Cell Nucleus', 'Animals', 'Cytoplasm', 'Mice', '*Osmotic Pressure', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets/*metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'Small Ubiquitin-Related Modifier Proteins/metabolism']",2007/11/21 09:00,2008/07/09 09:00,['2007/11/21 09:00'],"['2007/11/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/09 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/21 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcb.21637 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2008 May 15;104(2):488-98. doi: 10.1002/jcb.21637.,,"['CA68485/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA64140/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA77274/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,"['Copyright Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study we have evaluated the combined effects of UVA irradiation and furocoumarins derivatives on (a) erythroid differentiation and apoptosis of human leukemia K562 cells and (b) globin gene expression in cultures of human erythroid progenitors derived from the peripheral blood. To prove the activity of a series of linear and angular furocoumarins derivatives, we employed the human leukemia K562 cell line and the two-phase liquid culture procedure for growing erythroid progenitors. Quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase-chain assay (Q-RT-PCR) was employed for quantification of the accumulation of globin mRNAs. The results obtained demonstrate that both linear and angular furocoumarins are strong inducers of erythroid differentiation of K562 cells. From a preliminary screening, we have selected two derivatives, 5-methoxypsoralen (5-MOP) and trimethylangelicin (TMA), for which we have investigated their mechanism of action. The cell cycle analysis showed that these derivatives induce, after irradiation, a cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase, followed by apoptosis. Mitochondrial depolarisation and caspases activation seem to be involved in the mechanism of cell death. In erythroid precursor cells, psoralens in combination with UVA irradiation, stimulate at very low concentrations a preferential increase of gamma-globin mRNA. Altogether, these data suggest that psoralen derivatives warrant further evaluation as potential therapeutic drugs in beta-thalassemia and sickle cell anemia.","['Viola, Giampietro', 'Vedaldi, Daniela', ""Dall'Acqua, Francesco"", 'Fortunato, Elena', 'Basso, Giuseppe', 'Bianchi, Nicoletta', 'Zuccato, Cristina', 'Borgatti, Monica', 'Lampronti, Ilaria', 'Gambari, Roberto']","['Viola G', 'Vedaldi D', ""Dall'Acqua F"", 'Fortunato E', 'Basso G', 'Bianchi N', 'Zuccato C', 'Borgatti M', 'Lampronti I', 'Gambari R']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Padova, Via Marzolo 5, 35131 Padova, Italy. giampietro.viola.1@unipd.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071013,England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Furocoumarins)', '0 (Phosphatidylserines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics/radiation effects', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects/radiation effects', '*Cell Differentiation/drug effects/genetics/radiation effects', 'DNA Damage', '*Erythroid Cells/drug effects/metabolism/pathology/radiation effects', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Furocoumarins/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Globins/*biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects/genetics/radiation effects', 'Phosphatidylserines/biosynthesis', 'RNA, Messenger/*biosynthesis', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Ultraviolet Rays']",2007/11/21 09:00,2008/04/19 09:00,['2007/11/21 09:00'],"['2007/07/18 00:00 [received]', '2007/10/01 00:00 [revised]', '2007/10/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/11/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/19 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-2952(07)00671-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bcp.2007.10.007 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2008 Feb 15;75(4):810-25. doi: 10.1016/j.bcp.2007.10.007.

Red blood cell (RBC) precursors will accumulate antifolates like AMT and MTX through the same mechanism by which they take up folate. Intracellular folate and antifolates are then metabolized to polyglutamates that remain within the mature RBCs. RBC MTX has been correlated with toxicity and/or treatment efficacy among patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) or rheumatoid arthritis. Because AMT may offer clinically relevant advantages over MTX, we are testing whether it can be administered safely in multiagent therapy to children with ALL. Total RBC AMT was measured to monitor compliance with this oral, outpatient regimen, and to estimate AMT exposure to the bone marrow. Here we describe methods for quantifying each AMT-polyglutamate species within the RBCs of patients. The assay was linear over a concentration range of 62.5-500 nmol/L. Recovery of individual AMT-polyglutamates ranged from 85% to 92%, and the intraday coefficients of variation were 1.3% to 3.6%. Long-chain AMT-polyglutamates (triglutamate and tetraglutamate forms) accounted for over 40% of intracellular AMT within the RBCs of patients. Patients with long-chain AMT polyglutamate concentrations above the median tended to have lower mean neutrophil counts during weekly AMT therapy, which suggests that RBC AMT polyglutamate accumulation may correlate with hematologic toxicity. As AMT continues to be tested in clinical trials, the methods described here will be useful to define relationships between clinical response to AMT and RBC accumulation of AMT-polyglutamates.","['Vijayanathan, Veena', 'Smith, Angela K', 'Zebala, John A', 'Kamen, Barton A', 'Cole, Peter D']","['Vijayanathan V', 'Smith AK', 'Zebala JA', 'Kamen BA', 'Cole PD']","['Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, The Cancer Institute of New Jersey, Robert Wood Johnson Medical School/UMDNJ, New Brunswick, NJ, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20070907,United States,Transl Res,Translational research : the journal of laboratory and clinical medicine,101280339,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Folic Acid Antagonists)', '25513-46-6 (Polyglutamic Acid)', 'JYB41CTM2Q (Aminopterin)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aminopterin/administration & dosage/*blood', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/blood', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid/*methods', 'Erythrocytes/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Folic Acid Antagonists/administration & dosage/blood', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage/*blood', 'Polyglutamic Acid/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*blood/*drug therapy', 'Reference Standards', 'Tissue Distribution']",2007/11/21 09:00,2008/01/04 09:00,['2007/11/21 09:00'],"['2007/06/15 00:00 [received]', '2007/08/06 00:00 [revised]', '2007/08/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/11/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/04 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1931-5244(07)00213-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.trsl.2007.08.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Transl Res. 2007 Dec;150(6):367-73. doi: 10.1016/j.trsl.2007.08.002.

A high number of CD3(+) cells (> 177 x 10(6)/kg) given to patients resulted in statistically less TRM and more intensive graft versus leukemia effect without producing more severe grades of GVHD, all resulting in a significantly better overall clinical outcome from haploidentical transplantation.","['Dong, Lujia', 'Wu, Tong', 'Zhang, Mei-Jie', 'Gao, Zhi-Yong', 'Lu, Dao-Pei']","['Dong L', 'Wu T', 'Zhang MJ', 'Gao ZY', 'Lu DP']","[""Peking University, People's Hospital, Beijing, China. lujialidong@yahoo.com.cn""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,"['0 (Antilymphocyte Serum)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (HLA Antigens)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antilymphocyte Serum/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/mortality', 'CD3 Complex/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'China/epidemiology', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect', '*HLA Antigens/adverse effects/immunology', 'Haploidy', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/*mortality', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*therapy', 'Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation/mortality', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/*transplantation', 'Transplantation Conditioning/methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous/adverse effects/mortality']",2007/11/21 09:00,2008/01/09 09:00,['2007/11/21 09:00'],"['2007/06/06 00:00 [received]', '2007/09/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/11/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/09 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1083-8791(07)00455-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbmt.2007.09.007 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2007 Dec;13(12):1515-24. doi: 10.1016/j.bbmt.2007.09.007.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Yet there has been a substantial change in clinical practice, with increasing numbers of adults receiving unrelated donor PBSC grafts. We compared outcomes after 331 PBSC and 586 BM transplants in adults with leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) who were followed for a median of 3 years after transplantation. PBSC recipients were less likely to have chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and more likely to have MDS, to have poor performance scores, and to be transplanted more recently. Outcomes were analyzed using Cox regression models. Rates of grades 2-4 acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) (58% versus 45%, P < .001) and chronic GVHD (cGVHD) (56% versus 42%, P < .001) were significantly higher with PBSC than with BM transplants. Rates of grade II-IV aGVHD were similar with PBSC and BM transplants. The 3-year probabilities of treatment-related mortality (TRM), leukemia recurrence, leukemia-free, and overall survival (OS) were similar in the 2 groups with 3-year leukemia-free survival rates of 30% and 32% after transplantation of PBSC and BM, respectively. Unlike results after HLA-matched sibling donor PBSC transplants, we did not identify a survival advantage with PBSC grafts in patients receiving unrelated donor transplants for advanced leukemia. The higher rate of cGVHD after PBSC transplants and, consequently, more frequent late adverse events warrant extended follow up of PBSC recipients.","['Eapen, Mary', 'Logan, Brent R', 'Confer, Dennis L', 'Haagenson, Michael', 'Wagner, John E', 'Weisdorf, Daniel J', 'Wingard, John R', 'Rowley, Scott D', 'Stroncek, David', 'Gee, Adrian P', 'Horowitz, Mary M', 'Anasetti, Claudio']","['Eapen M', 'Logan BR', 'Confer DL', 'Haagenson M', 'Wagner JE', 'Weisdorf DJ', 'Wingard JR', 'Rowley SD', 'Stroncek D', 'Gee AP', 'Horowitz MM', 'Anasetti C']","['Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Wisconsin 53226, USA. meapen@mcw.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20071010,United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', '*Graft vs Host Disease', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects/mortality', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Registries', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation, Homologous/adverse effects', 'Treatment Outcome', 'United States/epidemiology']",2007/11/21 09:00,2008/01/09 09:00,['2007/11/21 09:00'],"['2007/04/12 00:00 [received]', '2007/08/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/11/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/09 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1083-8791(07)00385-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbmt.2007.08.006 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2007 Dec;13(12):1461-8. doi: 10.1016/j.bbmt.2007.08.006.

Surprisingly, these almost always carry introduced motifs available for N-glycosylation (Asn-X-Ser/Thr). Introduced motifs are uncommon on normal B cells, but are on other germinal center (GC)-associated B-cell malignancies suggesting a site-specific role. They are not evident in mutated chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or myeloma. Recently, we found that the glycosylation sites are unusual in containing oligomannose glycans, which are apparently displayed on tumor cell surface IgM. This suggests a potential interaction with a mannose receptor in the GC. However, natural N-glycosylation sites exist in germline (GL) V region genes, particularly the V4-34 gene expressed by normal B cells and by some malignancies, including CLL, potentially undermining the selective importance for FL. To compare oligosaccharide addition at the introduced and natural sites, we expressed V region genes as single chain Fv (scFv) and analyzed the added glycans. In contrast to introduced sites, which were oligomannosylated, the natural GL motif in the V4-34 sequence had no added sugars. The remarkable selective glycosylation within the heavy chain V region gene of FL apparently permits only limited processing to oligomannose at somatically mutated motifs, creating a feature exploitable by GC lymphomas.","['McCann, Katy J', 'Ottensmeier, Christian H', 'Callard, Alice', 'Radcliffe, Catherine M', 'Harvey, David J', 'Dwek, Raymond A', 'Rudd, Pauline M', 'Sutton, Brian J', 'Hobby, Paul', 'Stevenson, Freda K']","['McCann KJ', 'Ottensmeier CH', 'Callard A', 'Radcliffe CM', 'Harvey DJ', 'Dwek RA', 'Rudd PM', 'Sutton BJ', 'Hobby P', 'Stevenson FK']","['Genetic Vaccine Group, Cancer Sciences Division, University of Southampton School of Medicine, Southampton, UK. kjm8@soton.ac.uk <kjm8@soton.ac.uk>']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071119,England,Mol Immunol,Molecular immunology,7905289,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Oligosaccharides)']",IM,"['Cells, Cultured', 'Glycosylation', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/*metabolism', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/*metabolism', 'Oligosaccharides/immunology/metabolism']",2007/11/21 09:00,2008/08/23 09:00,['2007/11/21 09:00'],"['2007/10/04 00:00 [received]', '2007/10/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/11/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/23 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0161-5890(07)00803-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.molimm.2007.10.009 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Immunol. 2008 Mar;45(6):1567-72. doi: 10.1016/j.molimm.2007.10.009.

Significant correlation has been reported between consumption of arsenic-contaminated water and occurrence of liver cancer; moreover, ATO-treated leukemia patients also suffers from liver toxicity. Hence, modulation of ATO action may help to prevent populations suffering from arsenic toxicity as well as help reduce the drug-related side effects. Dithiothreitol (DTT) is a well-known dithiol agent reported to modulate the action of ATO. Controversial reports exist regarding the effect of DTT on ATO-induced apoptosis in leukemia cells. To the best of our knowledge, no report illustrates the modulatory effect of DTT on ATO-induced liver toxicity, the prime target for arsenic. Mitochondria serve as the doorway to apoptosis and have been implicated in ATO-induced cell death. Hence, we attempted to study the modulatory effect of DTT on ATO-induced dysfunction of mammalian liver mitochondria and human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line (Hep3B). We, for the first time, report that ATO produces complex I-mediated electron transfer inhibition, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, respiration inhibition, and ATO-induced ROS-mediated mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) opening. DTT at low concentration (100 muM and less) prevents the effect of ATO-induced complex I-malfunctions. DTT protects mitochondria from ATO-mediated opening of MPT and membrane potential depolarization. DTT also prevented ATO-induced Hep3B cell death. Thus, at low concentrations DTT abrogates the effect of ATO on rat liver mitochondria and Hep3B cell line. Therefore, the present result suggests, that use of low concentration of dithiols as food supplement may prevent arsenic toxicity in affected population.","['Paul, Manash K', 'Kumar, Rajinder', 'Mukhopadhyay, Anup K']","['Paul MK', 'Kumar R', 'Mukhopadhyay AK']","['Department of Biology, Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Mohali, MGSIPA Complex, Adjacent Sacred Heart School, Sector-26, Chandigarh-160019 [corrected] India. paul_cancerbiotech@yahoo.co.in']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071119,United States,Toxicol Appl Pharmacol,Toxicology and applied pharmacology,0416575,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Electron Transport Chain Complex Proteins)', '0 (Environmental Pollutants)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)', 'T8ID5YZU6Y (Dithiothreitol)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*toxicity', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dithiothreitol/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Electron Transport Chain Complex Proteins/metabolism', 'Environmental Pollutants/*toxicity', 'Humans', 'Liver Neoplasms', 'Male', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Mitochondria, Liver/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Oxides/*toxicity', 'Oxygen Consumption/drug effects', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism']",2007/11/21 09:00,2008/02/27 09:00,['2007/11/21 09:00'],"['2007/05/31 00:00 [received]', '2007/09/11 00:00 [revised]', '2007/09/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/11/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/27 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0041-008X(07)00416-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.taap.2007.09.020 [doi]']",ppublish,Toxicol Appl Pharmacol. 2008 Jan 15;226(2):140-52. doi: 10.1016/j.taap.2007.09.020.

Alloreactivity in CML patients has a durable potential. However a large proportion of relapsing patients, who have to undergo donor lymphocyte treatment is still abundant. METHODS: We studied a group of 31 CML patients post allogeneic transplantation for their level of T-cell receptor excision circles (TREC) and proportion of naive and memory/effector T cells in the peripheral blood (PB). TREC numbers were determined by quantitative PCR (qPCR) and T-cell subsets CD4(+)CD27(+)CD45RO(-), CD4(+)CD27(-)CD24RO(+), CD4(+)CCR7(+), and CD4(+)CCR7(-) by flow cytometry. Patients were analyzed for posttransplant chimerism, type of bcr-abl transcripts, and number of TREC in association with the presence of chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) and relapse. CML patients with TREC+ in PB had a higher proportion of CD4(+)CD27(+)CD45RO(-) cells (3.54 vs 2.45%; P = .105) and CD4(+)CCR7(+) cells (4.85 vs 2.67%; P = .007), and a lower proportion of CD4(+)CD27(-)CD45RO(+) cells (5.55 vs 9.09%; P = .037). The incidence of cGvHD was reduced among TREC+ CML patients (3/14 vs 11/17; P = .006). RESULTS: The 5 out of 31 CML patients who relapsed were characterized by the presence of b2a2, b3/a2 or both type of transcripts, a lack of TREC in the blood, and a lower proportion of naive and effector/memory T cells. No association was observed between any of HLA specificities, type of bcr-abl transcripts and incidence of relapse. CONCLUSION: The presence of TREC is affected by chronic GvHD; TREC negativity may constitute a risk of mixed chimerism and relapse.","['Wysoczanska, B', 'Bogunia-Kubik, K', 'Dlubek, D', 'Jaskula, E', 'Sok, A', 'Drabczak-Skrzypek, D', 'Sedzimirska, M', 'Lange, A']","['Wysoczanska B', 'Bogunia-Kubik K', 'Dlubek D', 'Jaskula E', 'Sok A', 'Drabczak-Skrzypek D', 'Sedzimirska M', 'Lange A']","['L.

The main biological mechanisms contributing to cancer susceptibility can be grouped into broad categories : (1) cellular growth and differentiation, (2) DNA replication and repair, (3) xenobiotic metabolism, (4) apoptosis, (5) oxidative stress response and (6) cell cycle. To evaluate whether candidate genes in these pathways are involved in childhood leukemogenesis, we conducted association studies. We showed that leukemogenesis in children may be associated with genetic variants and that the combination of genotypes seems to be more predictive of risk than either of them independently. These results indicate that the genetic investigation of several enzymes (or metabolic pathways) is needed to explain the physiopathology of childhood leukemia because of the complexity of the environment and that of the inter-individual variability in cancer susceptibility.","['Sinnett, Daniel', ""N'Diaye, Nina"", 'St-Onge, Pascal', 'Healy, Jasmine']","['Sinnett D', ""N'Diaye N"", 'St-Onge P', 'Healy J']","[""Service d'Hematologie-Oncologie, Centre de Cancerologie Charles-Bruneau, Centre de Recherche, Hopital Sainte-Justine, Quebec, Canada. daniel.sinnett@umontreal.ca""]",['fre'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",,France,Med Sci (Paris),Medecine sciences : M/S,8710980,"['0 (Oxidants)', '0 (Xenobiotics)']",IM,"['Child', '*Environmental Exposure', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology/etiology/*genetics', 'Oxidants/toxicity', 'Xenobiotics/pharmacokinetics/toxicity']",2007/11/21 09:00,2008/01/24 09:00,['2007/11/21 09:00'],"['2007/11/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/24 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['00/00/0B/8C/ [pii]', '10.1051/medsci/20072311968 [doi]']",ppublish,Med Sci (Paris). 2007 Nov;23(11):968-74. doi: 10.1051/medsci/20072311968.,La leucemie de l'enfant: Une maladie genetique!,,,,,,,40,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A nano-HAp was prepared by a neutralization reaction of 0.1 mol calcium hydroxide suspension and 0.06 mol phosphoric acid solutions at room temperature over pH7. The various doses of the nano-HAp only and the nano-HAp mixture with cyclophosphamide (CY) were injected into mice inoculated with solid tumor lymphatic leukemia P388 and dispersed into PRMI 1640 media harvested the leukemia P388 cells. Sixty P388 BALB/C mice were randomly grouped; 36 of them were used as nano-HAp treated groups and 24 mice as the control groups. The leukemia growth in the mice was examined morphologically, histopathologically and under a transmission electron microscope (TEM). RESULTS: The nano-HAp was identified as a hydroxyapatite by an X-ray diffractometry (XRD) and a Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The morphology and sizes were observed under a TEM. The tissue growth inhibition ratio (weight%) of solid lymphatic leukemia P388 bearing mice treated with nano-HAp at doses 35 mg/kg, 53 mg/kg and nano-HAp (53 mg/kg) combined with CY (35 mg/kg) in 3 consecutive days via intraperitineal injections were 14.95%, 32.67% and 60.45% respectively.

Glucocorticoid resistance is present among 20% initial acute lymphoblastic leukemia, even 80% refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Glucocorticoid resistance has been an important determinant of clinical outcome. Glucocorticoid depends on glucocorticoid receptor (GR) to induce apoptosis. Glucocorticoid receptor, a number of nuclear hormone receptor superfamily, is mediated by many signal transduction systems. The mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) superfamily of serine/threonine kinases has emerged as an important component of cellular signal transduction. Four MAP kinase families, ERK, p38 MAP kinase, JNK, and ERK5, have been well characterized. p38 MAPK usually plays a role in regulating apoptosis, cell cycle arrest and cytokines production, et al. In steroid resistance patients, IL-2 combined with IL-4 can decrease glucocorticoid receptor ligand-binding affinity via p38MAPK. In human alveolar epithelial A549 cells, dexamethasone could inhibit the activation of p38MAPK. It is unclear that the effect of p38MAPK on glucocorticoid receptor function induced by dexamethasone in CEM cells. This study aimed to investigate effect of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase on glucocorticoid receptor function induced by dexamethasone in CEM cells. METHODS: Cell viability was determined by trypan blue dye exclusion. Apoptosis was evaluated by morphology and flow cytometry. Glucocorticoid receptor protein and p-p38MAPK protein were analyzed by Western Blot. RESULTS: When treatment with SB203580 and dexamethasone for 24 h to 72 h, the survival percentage was increased from 62.3%, 35.5% and 11.6% to 82.8%, 54.7% and 48.1%, respectively (P < 0.01). Co-treatment with SB203580 and dexamethasone resulted in the decrease of apoptotic percentage from 26.2% to 7.1% for 36 h (P < 0.01). p38 MAPK activation was apparent at 15 min, peaked at 1 h after dexamethasone treatment, and was sustained for 6 h. The phosphorylation was still observed at 48 h. Treatment with dexamethasone at 5 micromol/L for 12, 24, 36 and 48 h resulted in increase of GR(alpha) protein to 117%, 121%, 122% and 125% respectively. Unbinding to dexamethasone, GR(alpha) is in the cytoplasm. Nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio of GR(alpha) is 0.27. Treatment with dexamethasone at the same concentration and time resulted in the nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio increase to 0.48, 0.59, 0.95, 2.16 and 4.08 respectively. Combined treatment with SB203580 and dexamethasone resulted in the nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio decrease from 4.08 to 0.43 for 48 h (P < 0.05). The total GR(alpha) protein was unaffected. CONCLUSIONS: Expression of GR(alpha) protein is upregulated and translocated into nucleus. p38MAPK enhances GR(alpha) protein translocation into nucleus.","['He, Li', 'Li, Dan', 'Hou, Ke-Zuo', 'Liu, Yun-peng']","['He L', 'Li D', 'Hou KZ', 'Liu YP']","['Department of Pediatrics, The No.1 Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang 110001, China.']",['chi'],['Journal Article'],,China,Zhonghua Er Ke Za Zhi,Zhonghua er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of pediatrics,0417427,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (NR3C1 protein, human)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (Receptors, Glucocorticoid)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'OU13V1EYWQ (SB 203580)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dexamethasone/*pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Glucocorticoids/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/pharmacology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*pathology', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Pyridines/pharmacology', 'Receptors, Glucocorticoid/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*drug effects/metabolism']",2007/11/21 09:00,2010/12/24 06:00,['2007/11/21 09:00'],"['2007/11/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/24 06:00 [medline]', '2007/11/21 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Er Ke Za Zhi. 2007 Sep;45(9):687-91.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On the basis of the conventional cytogenetic analysis, molecular methods have improved pediatric hematologists/oncologist's ability to accurately and rapidly perform risk-stratification on patients with childhood ALL during the last few years. The aim of the present study was to assess the demography of cytogenetic abnormalities in childhood ALL. METHOD: The study subjects consisted of 124 newly diagnosed ALL patients younger than 16 years of age, who were diagnosed at the Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Soochow University Children's Hospital. The diagnosis and FAB subtypes of ALL was determined by Wright-Giemsa-stained bone marrow smears and cytochemical staining. Immunophenotyping of the bone marrow samples was performed by flow cytometry. Multiplex polymerase chain reaction (Multiplex PCR) analysis was performed to detect the 29 most common leukemia translocations for routine molecular diagnostic hematopathology practice, and complement the information gained from conventional cytogenetic analysis. RESULTS: Cytogenetic analysis was successful in 112 of 124 children with ALL. Sixty-eight (60%) of them had clonal chromosomal abnormalities. Numerical imbalances consisted of hyperdiploid (> 47 chromosomes, 36 cases), hypodiploid (< 46 chromosomes, 14 cases), pseudodiploidy (18 cases). Chromosomal translocations were observed in 13 patients by conventional cytogenetic analysis. Three cases were found positive for 4; 11 translocation, 3 cases for 9; 22 translocation, 1 case for 1; 19 translocation and 6 cases for other rare translocations. Multiplex-PCR analysis detected 116 of the 124 ALL patients. Thirteen cases of TEL-AML1, 10 cases of rearrangement in the MLL gene, 4 cases of E2A-PBX1, 4 cases of E2A-HLF, 3 cases of BCR-ABL, 2 cases of TLS-ERG, 32 cases of HOX11 were detected by Multiplex PCR in B-lineage leukemias. SIL-TAL1 had been found in 4 of 7 of T-lineage leukemias. CONCLUSIONS: Sixty-eight cases of ALL showed chromosomal aberrations.

Although several FLT3-selective small molecule inhibitors and antibodies were developed with varied degrees of success, to address the specificity and resistance, new approaches for specifically targeted FLT3 are needed and RNA interference is a promising choice. The aim of the present study was to investigate the efficacy of suppression of FLT3 induced by small hairpin interfering RNA (shRNA) on myeloproliferation and apoptosis in an acute monocytic leukemia (AMOL) cell line THP-1. METHODS: FLT3-targeted small hairpin interfering RNA (FLT3-shRNA) was designed and synthesized by transcription system in vitro was transfected into THP-1 cells. Firstly FLT3 mRNA level was detected by semi-quantitative RT-PCR and FLT3 protein level was detected by flow cytometry (FCM) to verify the efficacy on FLT3-shRNA interference at 48 h after transfection. Cell growth viability was measured at 24 h, 48 h and 72 h after treatment with CCK-8. The distribution of cell cycle was assayed by FCM, and apoptosis was analyzed by DNA Ladder and Annexin V-FITC Staining at 48 h. RESULTS: FLT3 targeted shRNAs was synthesized successfully and the concentration of 15 nmol/L for 48 h could obtain desirable downregulation of FLT3 expression, the inhibitory percentages of FLT3 mRNA and protein were (72.95 +/- 2.07)% and (65.39 +/- 5.57)%, respectively. The suppression of FLT3 induced by FLT3-shRNA resulted in marked inhibition of cell growth and the inhibitory percentages were (36.66 +/- 3.67)% at 48 h, (35.56 +/- 0.73)% at 72 h. FLT3-shRNA induced the inhibition of cell cycle from G(0)/G(1) phase to S phase, the percentage of sub-G(0)/G(1) phase (65.71 +/- 4.47)% was higher than those in the PBS-control group (52.23 +/- 2.98)%, NC-shRNA control group (51.81 +/- 1.44)%, P < 0.01; the percentage of S phase (25.11 +/- 2.70)% was lower than those in the PBS-control group (34.41 +/- 4.07)% and NC-shRNA control group (32.50 +/- 1.46)%, P < 0.05. Furthermore treatment with FLT3-shRNA for 48 h resulted in clear apoptosis ladder, the percentage of early apoptosis detected by Annexin V-FITC was (18.59 +/- 2.07)% which was significantly higher than that in the PBS-control group (4.00 +/- 0.50)% and the NC-shRNA control group (6.06 +/- 0.70)%, P < 0.001.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: A retrospective study of patients with various benign and malignant hematological disorders and recipients of hematopoietic stem cell transplant who were treated at Riyadh Armed Forces Hospital, Saudi Arabia between January 1991 and December 2002 and who developed tuberculous infections was conducted. RESULTS: Tuberculous infections occurred in eighteen patients with hematological disorders and hematopoietic stem cell transplant. The main associated factors were: reduced immunity due to the primary hematological disorder, age more than 50 years and the administration of cytotoxic chemotherapy, steroids or radiotherapy. These infections frequently involved the lungs and predominantly occurred in males and in patients with chronic myeloproliferative disorders, myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia. In patients treated with intravenous cytotoxic chemotherapy, tuberculous infections tended to occur earlier and also tended to be more disseminated compared to infections occurring in patients treated with oral chemotherapy. Anti-tuberculous treatment was given to 16 patients and it was successful in 15 of these patients. CONCLUSION: Tuberculous infections cause significant morbidity and mortality in patients with various hematological disorders and in recipients of hematopoietic stem cell transplant. The early administration of anti-tuberculous therapy and compliance with drug treatment are associated with successful outcomes while delayed management, drug resistance and the presence of miliary infections are associated with poor prognosis and high mortality rates.","['Al-Anazi, Khalid Ahmed', 'Al-Jasser, Asma Marzouq', 'Evans, David Alan Price']","['Al-Anazi KA', 'Al-Jasser AM', 'Evans DA']","['Section of Adult Hematology and Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant, King Faisal Cancer Centre, King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre, P.O.

We studied 122 donor/recipient pairs who received HLA-identical transplants from siblings at the Universidade Estadual de Campinas, Brazil, between June 1996 and June 2006. Donor/recipient alleles for TNFA-238 and IL2-330/+166 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) were analysed by PCR-SSP. No association was observed between the risk of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and these SNP. However, our findings suggest that the polymorphism of promoter gene TNFA-238GA is associated with the occurrence and severity of chronic GVHD. The probability of chronic GVHD in patients with GA genotype at position -238 of TNFA gene is 91.7% in contrast to 59.4% in patients with GG genotype (P = 0.038). In patients with donor GA genotype the probability of chronic GVHD is 90.8%, and 57.9% in patients with donor GG genotype (P = 0.038). The probability of extensive chronic GVHD in patients with TNFA-238GA is 91.7% compared with 46.3% in patients with TNFA-238GG (P = 0.0046). In patients with donor GA genotype at position -238 of the TNFA gene, it is 81.7%, compared with 44.5% in patients with donor GG genotype (P = 0.016). However, further studies with more patients are required to identify cytokine gene polymorphisms and their association with transplant-related complication in Brazil, particularly due to ethnic background, the relatively low power of detection of genetic markers of this study, and the complexity of the MHC region.","['Viel, D O', 'Tsuneto, L T', 'Sossai, C R', 'Lieber, S R', 'Marques, S B D', 'Vigorito, A C', 'Aranha, F J P', 'de Brito Eid, K A', 'Oliveira, G B', 'Miranda, E C M', 'de Souza, C A', 'Visentainer, J E L']","['Viel DO', 'Tsuneto LT', 'Sossai CR', 'Lieber SR', 'Marques SB', 'Vigorito AC', 'Aranha FJ', 'de Brito Eid KA', 'Oliveira GB', 'Miranda EC', 'de Souza CA', 'Visentainer JE']","['Laboratorio de Imunogenetica, Departamento de Analises Clinicas, Universidade Estadual de Maringa, Maringa, PR, Brazil.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Scand J Immunol,Scandinavian journal of immunology,0323767,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Brazil', 'Child', 'Female', 'Genotype', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*genetics/immunology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Interleukin-2/*genetics/immunology', 'Leukemia/genetics/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymorphism, Genetic/*genetics/immunology', 'Siblings', 'Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*genetics/immunology']",2007/11/21 09:00,2008/01/16 09:00,['2007/11/21 09:00'],"['2007/11/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/16 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['SJI2021 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-3083.2007.02021.x [doi]']",ppublish,Scand J Immunol. 2007 Dec;66(6):703-10. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-3083.2007.02021.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous studies have suggested adjusting purine analogues dosing according to TPMT activity but measurements are costly and time-consuming. It is still unclear, especially under treatment, whether the simpler TPMT genotyping reliably predicts enzyme activity. Our aim was to study the possible correlation of TPMT genotype with phenotype. METHODS: We determined the genotypic status and TMPT activity, at diagnosis and after 6 months of maintenance therapy, of 118 children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Eighty-nine per cent of the children had a homozygous wild-type genotype (group 1), 11% had one or two mutant allele(s) (group 2). At both time points, TPMT activity (U/mL peripheral red blood cell) was significantly higher in group 1 than in group 2 (P < 0.001) but inter-group levels overlapped considerably. There was considerable heterogeneity in the percentage increase in TPMT activity after therapy, and little correlation between metabolites ratio [6-methylmercaptopurine derivative/6-thioguanine nucleotides (6-TGN)] and TPMT activity at the end of 6 months' maintenance treatment. These results show that TPMT activity cannot be used as an accurate tool for 6-mercaptopurine monitoring. CONCLUSION: Genotyping at diagnosis identifies patients with a homozygous mutant TPMT and may prevent severe and life-threatening toxicity. ALL treatment monitoring should preferentially be based on repeated determinations of intracellular active metabolites (6-TGN) and methylated metabolites.","['Fakhoury, M', 'Andreu-Gallien, J', 'Mahr, A', 'Medard, Y', 'Azougagh, S', 'Vilmer, E', 'Jacqz-Aigrain, E']","['Fakhoury M', 'Andreu-Gallien J', 'Mahr A', 'Medard Y', 'Azougagh S', 'Vilmer E', 'Jacqz-Aigrain E']","['Paediatric Pharmacology and Pharmacogenetic Department, Robert Debre Hospital, Paris, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,J Clin Pharm Ther,Journal of clinical pharmacy and therapeutics,8704308,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.67 (thiopurine methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Erythrocytes/enzymology', 'Female', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/metabolism/*therapeutic use', 'Methyltransferases/*genetics/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/genetics']",2007/11/21 09:00,2008/01/30 09:00,['2007/11/21 09:00'],"['2007/11/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/30 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['JCP858 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2710.2007.00858.x [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Pharm Ther. 2007 Dec;32(6):633-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2710.2007.00858.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An age-dependent increase of both DP T-cell subsets was observed, while SP T cells remained stable throughout life. Flow cytometry and polymerase chain reaction analysis of the TRBV expression profiles showed the presence of a TRBV restriction within CD4(+)CD8(+) DP cells in more than half (53/103; 55.3%) of the individuals >65 years of age, regardless the actual number of DP T cells observed. Clonal expansions were more prominent within the CD4(high)CD8(low) subset, accounting for most circulating DP clones (47/103; 45.6%). A few cases showed more than one (up to three) monoclonal expansion. Clonal CD4(low)CD8(high) DP T-lymphocyte expansions were detected in only 10/103 samples (9.7%) and showed a close phenotypic similarity to the rare T-cell large granular lymphocyte leukaemias.

Monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis also aggregates in CLL families. However, the clinical implication of familial aggregation is minimal given the overall rarity of CLL. Linkage studies have been conducted in high-risk CLL families to screen the whole genome for loci that contribute to susceptibility but no gene mutations have yet been identified by this method. Association studies of candidate genes have implicated immune function and other genes but more studies are needed to verify these findings.

Initiation factor eIF4E binds the 5' cap structure present on all cellular mRNAs. Its ability to associate with initiation factors eIF4G and eIF4A, forming the eIF4F complex, brings the mRNA to the 43S complex during the initiation of translation. Binding of eIF4E to eIF4G is inhibited in a competitive manner by 4E-BP1. Phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 decreases the affinity of this protein for eIF4E, thus favouring the binding of eIF4G and enhancing translation. We have previously shown that induction or activation of the tumour suppressor protein p53 rapidly leads to 4E-BP1 dephosphorylation, resulting in sequestration of eIF4E, decreased formation of the eIF4F complex and inhibition of protein synthesis. RESULTS: We now report that activation of p53 also results in modification of 4E-BP1 to a truncated form. Unlike full-length 4E-BP1, which is reversibly phosphorylated at multiple sites, the truncated protein is almost completely unphosphorylated. Moreover, the latter interacts with eIF4E in preference to full-length 4E-BP1. Inhibitor studies indicate that the p53-induced cleavage of 4E-BP1 is mediated by the proteasome and is blocked by conditions that inhibit the dephosphorylation of full-length 4E-BP1. Measurements of the turnover of 4E-BP1 indicate that the truncated form is much more stable than the full-length protein. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest a model in which proteasome activity gives rise to a stable, hypophosphorylated and truncated form of 4E-BP1, which may exert a long-term inhibitory effect on the availability of eIF4E, thus contributing to the inhibition of protein synthesis and the growth-inhibitory and pro-apoptotic effects of p53.","['Constantinou, Constantina', 'Elia, Androulla', 'Clemens, Michael J']","['Constantinou C', 'Elia A', 'Clemens MJ']","[""Translational Control Group, Centre for Molecular and Metabolic Signalling, Division of Basic Medical Sciences, St George's, University of London, Cranmer Terrace, London SW17 0RE, U.K.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Biol Cell,Biology of the cell,8108529,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (EIF4EBP1 protein, human)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Phosphoproteins/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*metabolism/pharmacology']",2007/11/21 09:00,2008/08/14 09:00,['2007/11/21 09:00'],"['2007/11/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/14 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['BC20070121 [pii]', '10.1042/BC20070121 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Cell. 2008 May;100(5):279-89. doi: 10.1042/BC20070121.,,['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The current study investigated the predictive value of index measures, known as research population data, for the detection of chronic lymphatic leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome. METHODS: Blood cell counts were performed in samples from 44 patients with chronic lymphatic leukemia, 19 patients with myelodysplastic syndrome and 199 healthy blood donors using the Beckman Coulter LH750. Means and standard deviations of volume, conductivity and scatter of lymphocytes and neutrophils were evaluated as predictors for both diseases. Their specificity and selectivity were evaluated by logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. RESULTS: Research population data were significantly different among groups. For chronic lymphatic leukemia, standard deviations of lymphocytes scatter and volume showed most relevant differences in comparison to healthy blood donors (sensitivity 88.6%, specificity 84.4%).

The incidence of SPMs in thyroid cancer survivors was increased with an SIR of 1.20 (95% confidence interval 1.17, 1.24) (based on pooled data from six studies of 70,844 thyroid cancer survivors). The SIR of the following SPMs was significantly increased: salivary gland, stomach, colon/colorectal, breast, prostate, kidney, brain/central nervous system, soft tissue sarcoma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, multiple myeloma, leukemia, bone/joints, and adrenal.

ATL continues to have a very bad prognosis because of the intrinsic resistance of leukaemic cells to conventional or even high-dose chemotherapy and because of the associated severe immunosuppression. Even though conventional chemotherapy remains the standard treatment in acute and lymphomatous types of the disease, the benefit of this intensive approach is not well established in chronic and smouldering ATL. Combination chemotherapy regimens, in particular those designed for the treatment of aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphomas or acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, have little effect in the treatment of ATL. Different combination regimens of conventional chemotherapy have been investigated in Japan, and recent results of intensive induction therapy showed a complete remission (CR) rate of about 40% in the aggressive forms of the disease. However, most of the patients relapsed and eventually died. Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation has been used in the treatment of a very small number of patients with ATL. High toxicity and transplant-related mortality were observed in these immunocompromised patients. New cytotoxic agents have also been used in pilot phase II studies in refractory or relapsed ATL patients, but significant results have only been observed with deoxycoformycin. Recently, promising results have been obtained with anti-Tac monoclonal antibodies directed against the alpha-chain of the interleukin-2 receptor (CD25), which is highly expressed on ATL cells but not on normal resting lymphocytes. Promising results were also reported in 2 phase II studies with combination therapy comprising the antiretroviral agent zidovudine and interferon-alpha (IFNalpha). In previously untreated patients with acute ATL, high and rapid (usually within 2 weeks) response rates were reported. In contrast, in lymphomatous ATL, both studies suggested a milder and slower effect of zidovudine and IFNalpha. In this case, this combination may be used as maintenance therapy after a CR or good partial response induced by polychemotherapy. Since cross resistance between chemotherapy and zidovudine and IFNalpha does not seem to occur, a combination with best induction polychemotherapy is warranted.","['Hermine, O', 'Wattel, E', 'Gessain, A', 'Bazarbachi, A']","['Hermine O', 'Wattel E', 'Gessain A', 'Bazarbachi A']","['Department of Hematology and CNRS URA 1461, Necker University Hospital, Paris, France. hermine@necker.fr']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,New Zealand,BioDrugs,"BioDrugs : clinical immunotherapeutics, biopharmaceuticals and gene therapy",9705305,,,,2007/11/21 09:00,2007/11/21 09:01,['2007/11/21 09:00'],"['2007/11/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/11/21 09:01 [medline]', '2007/11/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['100603 [pii]', '10.2165/00063030-199810060-00003 [doi]']",ppublish,BioDrugs. 1998 Dec;10(6):447-62. doi: 10.2165/00063030-199810060-00003.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Transfusions of red blood cells and platelets comprise the basis of supportive care for anaemia and thrombocytopenia. In patients who progress to acute myeloid leukaemia, cytotoxic chemotherapy is used. In MDS, haemopoietic growth factors can enhance: proliferation and differentiation of normal and myelodysplastic haemopoietic progenitor cells, and prevent premature apoptosisacceleration of haemopoietic recovery after intensive chemotherapy and amelioration of mature cell function; and sensitisation of malignant cells for the cytotoxic action of chemotherapeutic agents. There is widespread clinical experience with the use of epoetin (EPO), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). A meta-analysis of 17 trials with EPO showed a stimulation of erythropoiesis, resulting in a discontinuation of the need for transfusions or an increase in haemoglobin levels of at least 15 g/L in 16% of 205 patients. Favourable factors for the response were an initial absence of a need for transfusion and a serum EPO level <200 U/L. In clinical phase I/II studies of GM-CSF administration, a dose-dependent increase in the absolute neutrophil count was seen in >80% of patients, as well as a decrease in the infection rate. The effect on survival could not be assessed. Lower platelet counts, with a risk of bleeding, bone pain, local erythema at the subcutaneous injection site and phlebitis during intravenous infusion, were observed. The combined administration of GM-CSF and EPO to a small number of patients resulted in an increase in haemoglobin levels or a decrease in the need for transfusion, with an overall response rate of 46%, but is not a proven treatment. The use of G-CSF increased the absolute neutrophil count in about 90% of patients with MDS, and was accompanied by an improvement of neutrophil function, which is frequently impaired in these patients. However, contradictory data exist on the influence of prophylactic G-CSF treatment on the infection rate. Bone pain and thrombocytopenia were the most important adverse effects of G-CSF treatment. Synergism of G-CSF and EPO has not yet been proven in randomised phase III trials, although selected patients showing no response to EPO alone may achieve normal haemoglobin levels after receiving additional G-CSF. Treatment in vivo with EPO, GM-CSF or G-CSF has not been shown to change the percentage of bone marrow cells carrying cytogenetic aberrations. However, individual patients have shown a reversal from a monoclonal to a polyclonal pattern with GM-CSF therapy.","['Geissler, R G', 'Ganser, A']","['Geissler RG', 'Ganser A']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,New Zealand,BioDrugs,"BioDrugs : clinical immunotherapeutics, biopharmaceuticals and gene therapy",9705305,,,,2007/11/21 09:00,2007/11/21 09:01,['2007/11/21 09:00'],"['2007/11/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/11/21 09:01 [medline]', '2007/11/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['100202 [pii]', '10.2165/00063030-199810020-00002 [doi]']",ppublish,BioDrugs. 1998 Aug;10(2):97-109. doi: 10.2165/00063030-199810020-00002.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using immunosuppressive prophylaxis with cyclosporin and methotrexate, moderate to severe acute GVHD develops in approximately 45% of transplant recipients with an HLA-identical sibling donor and in >75% of patients from unrelated HLA-identical or partially matched related donors. The pathophysiology of GVHD is complex and still incompletely described. Experimental and clinical data indicate that GVHD is largely mediated by immunocompetent T cells in the donor stem cell graft which are reactive against recipient (host) tissues. Depletion of these immunocompetent T cells from the stem cell graft offers a way to effectively prevent GVHD. The first section of this review describes the technical principles of different methods of T cell depletion. The advantages, limitations and level of T cell depletion achievable by physical methods or by positive and negative immunoselection procedures using monoclonal antibodies are comprehensively discussed. A short section concentrates on technical problems in the enumeration of T cells in the context of depletion efficiency. In the section on clinical studies, the focus is on the efficacy of different T cell depletion methods in avoiding GVHD in different clinical settings. The various methods are compared in transplantation from HLA-identical and nonidentical siblings or matched unrelated donors. The major drawbacks of T cell depletion are discussed in detail. Failure of engraftment and graft rejection is a more frequent problem following T cell-depleted transplants, particularly with HLA nonidentical donor-recipient pairs. An increase in leukaemic relapse rate is seen in certain haematological malignancies, especially in chronic myeloid leukaemia. Delayed recovery of anti-infectious immunity occurs, leading to an increased incidence of cytomegalovirus and Epstein-Barr virus related problems. The aim of this review is not only to give an overview of published studies but also to review strategies to circumvent the drawbacks of TCD. Consequently, we attempt to describe the potential role of cells removed by different depletion methods in graft protection, anti-infectious immunity and graft-versus-leukaemia reactivity. Finally, the possibility of recovering all components of the original graft and readministering them in controlled amounts and at controlled times is discussed. This strategy of 'balanced component therapy' may allow the combination of a low rate and severity of GVHD without the disadvantages of T cell depletion.","['Hertenstein, B', 'Arseniev, L', 'Novotny, J', 'Ganser, A']","['Hertenstein B', 'Arseniev L', 'Novotny J', 'Ganser A']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,New Zealand,BioDrugs,"BioDrugs : clinical immunotherapeutics, biopharmaceuticals and gene therapy",9705305,,,,2007/11/21 09:00,2007/11/21 09:01,['2007/11/21 09:00'],"['2007/11/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/11/21 09:01 [medline]', '2007/11/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['090203 [pii]', '10.2165/00063030-199809020-00003 [doi]']",ppublish,BioDrugs. 1998 Feb;9(2):105-23. doi: 10.2165/00063030-199809020-00003.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cytokines appear to have a number of physiological roles, and consequently therapeutic implications, in obstetrics and gynaecology. In the central nervous system, interleukin-1 (IL-1) decreases gonadotropin releasing hormone and luteinising hormone levels and increases prolactin levels. Interferon-alpha and -gamma and tumour necrosis factor-alpha have negative effects on sperm motility and penetration rates. Seminal IL-6 and IL-8 levels correlate negatively with fertility. IL-8 seems to be involved in periovulatory events by attracting and activating neutrophils that play a role in timely follicular rupture. Leukaemia inhibitory factor has been shown to be essential for blastocyst implantation. Interleukin-1 may be one of the signals for the onset of human parturition, and may also play a role in the initiation of preterm labour associated with intra-amniotic infection. In a mouse model, pretreatment with subcutaneous IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) prevented IL-1-induced preterm parturition, suggesting a role for the use of anticytokine agents in the treatment of infection-associated preterm labour. IL-8 induces cervical ripening when applied locally to the cervix in rabbits, which indicates its pivotal role in cervical maturation. The evaluation of cytokine levels, especially IL-1, may be used as a diagnostic tool to monitor osteoporosis, and drugs such as IL-1ra that interfere with cytokine action could provide new therapies for the effective management of postmenopausal osteoporosis. In spite of all these possibilities, current cytokine-based therapies are still experimental, and numerous problems need to be resolved before they are used in routine clinical applications.","['Bukulmez, O', 'Arici, A']","['Bukulmez O', 'Arici A']","['Division of Reproductive Endocrinology, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,New Zealand,BioDrugs,"BioDrugs : clinical immunotherapeutics, biopharmaceuticals and gene therapy",9705305,,,,2007/11/21 09:00,2007/11/21 09:01,['2007/11/21 09:00'],"['2007/11/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/11/21 09:01 [medline]', '2007/11/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['080305 [pii]', '10.2165/00063030-199708030-00005 [doi]']",ppublish,BioDrugs. 1997 Sep;8(3):193-204. doi: 10.2165/00063030-199708030-00005.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Based at least in part on experience with autologous transplantation, circulating haemopoietic progenitor cells are now known to include pluripotent stem cells expressing indefinite self-renewal capacity that can be employed for restoring haemopoiesis following myeloablative treatment. A transient shifting of progenitor cells from extravascular sites into the circulation by chemopriming and/or cytokine treatment enables the collection, by apheresis, of a sufficient number of progenitor cells and stem cells to guarantee engraftment. The administration of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) has emerged as an efficient and usually well tolerated way to accomplish this mobilisation. For the donor, advantages of PBSC collection over traditional bone marrow harvesting include avoidance of anaesthesia and surgery, as well as the lack of need for blood transfusions or hospitalisation. In terms of clinical outcome, as compared with bone marrow-derived stem cells, the use of PBSCs seems to be associated with at least comparable (if not faster) recovery of leucocytes and platelets following transplantation. Allogeneic transplantation of PBSCs does not seem to be associated with a measurable increase in the incidence and severity of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Due to the >10-fold higher number of lymphoid subsets contained in a PBSC allograft, one might expect a faster immunological recovery and, possibly, a more pronounced graft-versus-leukaemia effect in the transplant patient. There are currently insufficient data available to address the issue of chronic GVHD. As with bone marrow cells, ex vivo manipulation of mobilised apheresis products (such as CD34+ cell selection, density gradient centrifugation and selection of graft-facilitating cells) is used or being developed to engineer allografts. It is expected that, based on the easier procurement of haemopoietic stem cells and advantageous engraftment characteristics, PBSCs may in the near future replace, at least in part, bone marrow-derived progenitor cells.","['Korbling, M']",['Korbling M'],"['Blood and Marrow Transplantation Section, Department of Hematology, University of Texas, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,New Zealand,BioDrugs,"BioDrugs : clinical immunotherapeutics, biopharmaceuticals and gene therapy",9705305,,,,1997/08/01 00:00,1997/08/01 00:01,['1997/08/01 00:00'],"['1997/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['080204 [pii]', '10.2165/00063030-199708020-00004 [doi]']",ppublish,BioDrugs. 1997 Aug;8(2):107-18. doi: 10.2165/00063030-199708020-00004.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, the use of G-CSF or GM-CSF shortens the duration of neutropenia, and may facilitate adherence to the chemotherapy schedule. However, only 1 study has demonstrated an increase in the complete remission rate, and this was in only 1 subgroup of patients (>60 years old). In acute myeloid leukaemia, the administration of G-CSF or GM-CSF after chemotherapy is well tolerated and is not associated with a stimulation of the leukaemic clone. In 4 out of 5 large randomised placebo-controlled studies, use of colony-stimulating factors led to a reduction of the duration of neutropenia. The complete remission rate was significantly higher for patients receiving growth factors in 2 studies, 1 with G-CSF and 1 with GM-CSF. However, only 1 of these studies, that with GM-CSF, demonstrated improved patient survival. The effect of G-CSF or GM-CSF given before and/or during chemotherapy of acute myeloid leukaemia has been evaluated in 4 randomised studies. The results are currently not sufficient to recommend the use of either growth factor in this indication. Many questions remain regarding the optimal dosage and schedule of administration of G-CSF or GM-CSF in acute leukaemia. The reduction of time to neutrophil recovery observed when the growth factor is administered after chemotherapy is not always translated into a benefit for the patient.

This group of disorders includes polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET) and idiopathic myelofibrosis (IMF). Furthermore, cases that cannot be clearly defined are regarded as unclassified CMPD. In Philadelphia-negative CMPD, recurrent cytogenetic abnormalities occur, but no specific abnormality has been defined to date. Chromosomal abnormalities detected in a neoplastic disease as a sole anomaly are of major importance, possibly constituting primary changes implicated in the initiation or progression of the neoplastic process. The aim of this study was to investigate the frequency and the type of single chromosomal changes in Philadelphia-negative CMPD patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: By conventional cytogenetics, 245 Philadelphia-negative CMPD cases at diagnosis were investigated for the frequency and the type of single chromosomal aberrations. RESULTS: Seventeen patients presented single chromosomal changes. These aberrations were, according to frequency, +8 (in 3 PV cases, 2 IMF and 2 unclassified myeloproliferative diseases), +13 in 3 cases (IMF, ET and unclassified myeloproliferative disease), monosomy 10 in 2 PV cases, monosomy 14 in one ET patient, +3, -4 and del(11)(q13) in 1 unclassified myeloproliferative disease each and monosomy 7 in 1 IMF case. CONCLUSION: It is unclear whether these abnormalities found at the time of diagnosis play a role in CMPD. However, since an isolated chromosomal abnormality may be implicated in the initiation of the neoplastic process, the documentation of more cases of CMPD with single abnormalities at the time of diagnosis would facilitate the identification of candidate genes involved in the neoplastic process.","['Panani, Anna D']",['Panani AD'],"['The Critical Care Department, Medical School of Athens University, Cytogenetics Unit, Evangelismos Hospital, Athens, Greece. apanani@med.uoa.gr']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Greece,In Vivo,"In vivo (Athens, Greece)",8806809,,IM,"['Chromosomes, Human/*genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/*genetics', 'Male']",2007/11/21 09:00,2007/12/27 09:00,['2007/11/21 09:00'],"['2007/11/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/27 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/21 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,In Vivo. 2007 Sep-Oct;21(5):867-70.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, cerebral lesions in existence prior to transplantation can be found. The aim of this study was to evaluate the benefit of cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) prior to stem cell transplantation. PATIENTS AND METHOD: Cerebral MR examinations of 116 children and adolescents were performed before SCT. Patients ranged in age from 1.1 to 21.4 years (mean 12.6 years). All MR images were obtained by a 1.5 T system. The predefined short protocol included an axial T 1-weighted SE sequence and a coronary T 2-weighted TSE sequence. We evaluated existing cerebral lesions, the diameter of the ventricular system, and the paranasal sinuses. In the case of pathological findings, the short examination protocol was expanded. RESULTS: In 5 of 116 children (4.3 %) we observed prior to SCT findings requiring immediate treatment although the patients did not show any clinical symptoms (1 x aspergilloma, 1 x hemorrhage of vascular anomaly). An increased risk of bleeding caused by cavernoma or another vascular anomaly without hemorrhage also had to be taken into account. 32 of 116 patients (37.1 %) showed atrophic lesions. In 42 children (36.2 %), we observed affections of the paranasal sinuses. CONCLUSION: The imaging findings requiring immediate treatment even though the children did not show any clinical signs, justify cerebral MR examinations prior to stem cell transplantation.","['Zimmermann, U', 'Mentzel, H-J', 'Wolf, J', 'Fuchs, D', 'Gruhn, B', 'Zintl, F', 'Kaiser, W A']","['Zimmermann U', 'Mentzel HJ', 'Wolf J', 'Fuchs D', 'Gruhn B', 'Zintl F', 'Kaiser WA']","['Institut f.

This patient cohort is ideally suited to test novel therapies such as immunotherapy. We treated patients-post-hepatic resection-with anti-idiotype monoclonal antibody vaccines to the tumor-associated antigens carcinoembryonic antigen (CeaVac) and human milk fat globule (TriAb), both of which are co-expressed in more than 90% of colorectal cancer patients. METHODS: Vaccinations commenced 6-12 weeks post-hepatic resection and consisted of four biweekly treatments of 2 mg CeaVac and TriAb, then monthly treatments for 2 years, then on every other month for 3 years. The primary endpoint was to investigate the proportion of patients recurrence-free at 2 years, and the objective of the study was to demonstrate that at least 58% would be recurrence-free at this time to consider the regimen worthy of further study. RESULTS: Between July 2001 and October 2004, 56 patients were accrued; 52 patients with margin-negative resection were eligible for analysis. Hepatic lobectomy was performed in 56% of patients with a median of one metastasis (range 1-3). Of the 52 eligible patients, 49 were evaluable for the primary end point. Median follow-up was 3.1 years. The proportion of patients recurrence-free at 2 years was 39%, with a lower confidence bound (LCB) of 0.29. Median recurrence-free survival was 16 months. The 2-year overall survival was 94% (95% CI, 0.81, 0.98). Only 10% of patients had documented grade-3 adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: Anti-idiotype monoclonal antibody vaccine therapy with CeaVac and TriAb as an adjuvant to curative resection of colorectal cancer hepatic metastases is well tolerated but did not improve 2-year recurrence-free survival when compared with the expected value of 40% reported for hepatic resection alone.","['Posner, Mitchell C', 'Niedzwiecki, Donna', 'Venook, Alan P', 'Hollis, Donna R', 'Kindler, Hedy L', 'Martin, Edward W', 'Schilsky, Richard L', 'Goldberg, Richard M', 'Mayer, Robert J']","['Posner MC', 'Niedzwiecki D', 'Venook AP', 'Hollis DR', 'Kindler HL', 'Martin EW', 'Schilsky RL', 'Goldberg RM', 'Mayer RJ']","['University of Chicago, 5841 S Maryland Avenue (MC5031), Chicago 60637, IL, USA. mposner@surgery.bsd.uchicago.edu']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20071116,United States,Ann Surg Oncol,Annals of surgical oncology,9420840,"['0 (Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic)', '0 (Cancer Vaccines)', '0 (Carcinoembryonic Antigen)', '0 (Glycolipids)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (milk fat globule)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic/therapeutic use', 'Cancer Vaccines/*administration & dosage', 'Carcinoembryonic Antigen/*immunology', 'Chemotherapy, Adjuvant', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/pathology/*therapy', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Glycolipids/*immunology', 'Glycoproteins/*immunology', '*Hepatectomy', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Cellular', '*Immunotherapy', 'Lipid Droplets', 'Liver Neoplasms/secondary/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vaccination']",2007/11/17 09:00,2008/02/22 09:00,['2007/11/17 09:00'],"['2007/06/07 00:00 [received]', '2007/07/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/07/18 00:00 [revised]', '2007/11/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/22 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/17 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1245/s10434-007-9654-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Surg Oncol. 2008 Jan;15(1):158-64. doi: 10.1245/s10434-007-9654-7.

(omit ""Apoptosis was evaluated by annexin V staining and flow cytometry""). c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1 (JNK1) association with GSTpi and activation of c-Jun were evaluated with immunoprecipitation and western blot. RESULTS: OZO derivatives showed anticancer effect against leukemia and breast cancer cells by MTS assay. The relative potency of their anticancer effects is OZO-H > OZO-Cl, OZO-OMe > OZO-CF(3). The anticancer activity of these compounds was correlated with their inhibition of GST activity in cancer cells. The immunoprecipitation result showed that the treatment of OZO-H released JNK1 from GSTpi-JNK1 complex. Consequently, the treatment of OZO-H in cancer cells induced JNK1 phophorylation and activated c-Jun in cancer cells. CONCLUSION: OZO-H is a novel GST inhibitor to release JNK1 for activation of JNK/c-Jun pathway (original is ""c-Jun to trigger apoptosis in cancer cells""). It provides a new class of GST target compound for anticancer therapy.","['Cui, Huifei', 'Shen, Jie', 'Lu, Dongning', 'Zhang, Tao', 'Zhang, Wenpeng', 'Sun, Duxin', 'Wang, Peng George']","['Cui H', 'Shen J', 'Lu D', 'Zhang T', 'Zhang W', 'Sun D', 'Wang PG']","['School of Pharmaceutical Science, Shandong University, Jinan, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071116,Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Thiazoles)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Glutathione/metabolism', 'Glutathione Transferase/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Humans', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'K562 Cells', 'Molecular Structure', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Thiazoles/chemistry/*pharmacology']",2007/11/17 09:00,2008/09/05 09:00,['2007/11/17 09:00'],"['2007/08/08 00:00 [received]', '2007/10/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/11/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/05 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/17 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00280-007-0632-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2008 Aug;62(3):509-15. doi: 10.1007/s00280-007-0632-3.

DESIGN: Observational case report. METHODS: A 24-year-old patient presented with complaints of pain, redness, and watering in the right eye since 15 days along with progressive decrease of vision since 3 months, leading to bilateral blindness. On examination, the visual acuity was absence of light perception in both eyes. Examination of the right eye revealed a PUK and adjacent localized scleritis. Fundus examination revealed bilateral multiple flame-shaped retinal haemorrhages. The optic discs in both eyes showed pallor with blurred margins. B-scan ultrasonography revealed bilateral optic nerve thickening. Head computed tomography was normal. Blood picture and bone marrow examination revealed features consistent with ALL. For sclerokeratitis, the patient was recommended topical steroids along with adjuvant therapy. She was referred to the oncology services for management of leukemia and was treated with chemotherapy. RESULTS: The sclerokeratitis responded well to medical management. However, no gain in vision could be achieved. CONCLUSIONS: ALL can present with sclerokeratitis and bilateral blindness due to optic nerve infiltration in an adult.

Despite the immunogenicity of melanoma, immunomodulatory therapies fail in the majority of patients with MM. An inability of DCs to sufficiently activate effector cells may, in part, underlie this failure of the antitumor response seen in most patients. In this work, we show that mutation of N-RAS or B-RAF, signature genetic lesions present in most MMs, potently induced the expression of cell-surface CD200, a repressor of DC function. Employing 2 independent, genome-wide microarray analyses, we identified CD200 as a highly dynamic, downstream target of RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK activation in melanoma. CD200 protein was similarly overexpressed in human melanoma cell lines and primary tumors. CD200 mRNA expression correlated with progression and was higher in melanoma than in other solid tumors or acute leukemia. Melanoma cell lines expressing endogenous CD200 repressed primary T cell activation by DCs, while knockdown of CD200 by shRNA abrogated this immunosuppressive effect. These data indicate that in addition to its effects on growth, survival, and motility, ERK activation in MM attenuates a host antitumor immune response, implicating CD200 and its interaction with the CD200 receptor as a potential therapeutic target for MM.","['Petermann, Kimberly B', 'Rozenberg, Gabriela I', 'Zedek, Daniel', 'Groben, Pamela', 'McKinnon, Karen', 'Buehler, Christin', 'Kim, William Y', 'Shields, Janiel M', 'Penland, Shannon', 'Bear, James E', 'Thomas, Nancy E', 'Serody, Jonathan S', 'Sharpless, Norman E']","['Petermann KB', 'Rozenberg GI', 'Zedek D', 'Groben P', 'McKinnon K', 'Buehler C', 'Kim WY', 'Shields JM', 'Penland S', 'Bear JE', 'Thomas NE', 'Serody JS', 'Sharpless NE']","['Department of Genetics, University of North Carolina School of Medicine, Chapel Hill, North Carolina 27599-7295, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (CD200R1 protein, human)', '0 (Orexin Receptors)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (BRAF protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras))', 'UQ4V77A8VA (antigens, CD200)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antigens, CD/genetics/*immunology', 'Antigens, Surface/genetics/immunology', 'Cell Movement/genetics/immunology', 'Cell Survival/genetics/immunology', 'Dendritic Cells/immunology/pathology', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/genetics/*immunology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/genetics/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/genetics/immunology', 'Melanoma/genetics/*immunology/pathology/therapy', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Orexin Receptors', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf/genetics/immunology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras)/genetics/immunology', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/genetics/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/pathology']",2007/11/17 09:00,2008/02/13 09:00,['2007/11/17 09:00'],"['2007/03/19 00:00 [received]', '2007/09/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/11/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/13 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/17 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1172/JCI32163 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Invest. 2007 Dec;117(12):3922-9. doi: 10.1172/JCI32163.,,"['P01 ES014635/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'CA106991/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K08 CA090679/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA106991/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'ES14635/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA105837/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA105837/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA112243-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA90679/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA112243/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC2075477,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All of the cell lines tested expressed TRAIL-R1 and TRAIL-R2. TRAIL decoy receptors were not detected, suggesting that the resistance of 2101 and MCF-7/ADR cells, strongly expressing PrPc, to TRAIL-mediated cell death was independent from the expression of TRAIL receptors and death-inducing signaling complex formation. Down-regulation of PrPc by small interfering RNA increased the sensitivity of Adriamycin- and TRAIL-resistant cells to TRAIL, but not to epirubicin/Adriamycin. TRAIL-mediated apoptosis in PrPc knocked-down cells was associated with caspase processing, Bid cleavage, and Mcl-1 degradation. In addition, an increased sensitivity of apoptosis-resistant cells to TRAIL after PrPc silencing was not associated with the increased recruitment of receptors and intracellular signaling molecule to the death-inducing signaling complex. Bcl-2 expression was substantially decreased after PrPc knock-down but the levels of Bcl-X(L) and Mcl-1 were not affected. The down-regulation of Bcl-2 was concomitant with Bax delocalization. Our findings support the notion that silencing of PrPc facilitates the activation of proapoptotic Bax by down-regulation of Bcl-2 expression, thereby abolishing the resistance of breast cancer cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis.","['Meslin, Franck', 'Hamai, Ahmed', 'Gao, Ping', 'Jalil, Abdelali', 'Cahuzac, Nathalie', 'Chouaib, Salem', 'Mehrpour, Maryam']","['Meslin F', 'Hamai A', 'Gao P', 'Jalil A', 'Cahuzac N', 'Chouaib S', 'Mehrpour M']","[""INSERM U753, Laboratoire d'Immunologie des Tumeurs Humaines, Interaction Effecteurs Cytotoxiques-Systeme Tumoral, Institut Gustave Roussy PR1 and IFR 54, Villejuif, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Prions)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy/*pathology', 'Carcinoma/*drug therapy/*pathology', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Doxorubicin/*pharmacology', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Gene Silencing', 'Humans', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Prions/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/*metabolism', 'bcl-X Protein/metabolism']",2007/11/17 09:00,2007/12/06 09:00,['2007/11/17 09:00'],"['2007/11/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['67/22/10910 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-0512 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2007 Nov 15;67(22):10910-9. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-0512.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using wild-type and c-Src-transformed NIH3T3 cells as a model, we identified Mcl-1 degradation and Bim up-regulation as a critical determinant of anoikis initiation. Detachment rapidly degraded Mcl-1 via a GSK-3beta-dependent proteasomal pathway and transcriptionally up-regulated Bim expression. Mcl-1 degradation in the presence of Bim was sufficient to induce anoikis. By analyzing nonmetastatic Saos-2 and metastatic derivative LM7 cells, we confirmed that dysregulation of Mcl-1 degradation and Bim induction during detachment contributes to decreased anoikis sensitivity of metastatic cells. Furthermore, knockdown of Mcl-1 or pharmacologic inhibition of the phosphoinositide-3-kinase/Akt and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways that suppress Mcl-1 degradation and Bim expression could markedly sensitize metastatic breast cancer cells to anoikis and prevent metastases in vivo. Therefore, Mcl-1 degradation primes the cell for Bax activation and anoikis, which can be blocked by oncogenic signaling in metastatic cells.","['Woods, Nicholas T', 'Yamaguchi, Hirohito', 'Lee, Francis Y', 'Bhalla, Kapil N', 'Wang, Hong-Gang']","['Woods NT', 'Yamaguchi H', 'Lee FY', 'Bhalla KN', 'Wang HG']","['H.

N-MYC overexpression has also been reported in human acute myeloid leukemias (AML), which we show here is a frequent event. Myeloid cells in N-Myc-overexpressing mouse bone marrow hyperproliferate but those in c-MYC-overexpressing bone marrow do not. The NH(2)-terminal transactivation domain, nuclear localization signal, and bHLH/LZ domain of N-Myc are essential for this effect. Microarray analysis revealed 969 differentially expressed genes between N-Myc- and c-MYC-overexpressing myeloid cells. N-Myc-overexpressing cells showed decreased transforming growth factor beta signaling and increased c-Jun-NH(2)-kinase signaling, both of which are associated with proliferation and leukemic transformation of myeloid cells. Mice transplanted with bone marrow expressing wild-type N-Myc developed clonal and transplantable AML after approximately 1 month; those transplanted with bone marrow expressing mutant N-Myc did not. Twist, a known suppressor of the p19Arf/p53 pathway, was up-regulated in all tumors. These results show that N-Myc overexpression is highly oncogenic in mouse myeloid cells and suggest that N-MYC up-regulation contributes to human myeloid leukemogenesis.","['Kawagoe, Hiroyuki', 'Kandilci, Ayten', 'Kranenburg, Tanya A', 'Grosveld, Gerard C']","['Kawagoe H', 'Kandilci A', 'Kranenburg TA', 'Grosveld GC']","[""Department of Genetics and Tumor Cell Biology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee 38105, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Separation', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Myeloid Cells/metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/*biosynthesis', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/metabolism']",2007/11/17 09:00,2007/12/06 09:00,['2007/11/17 09:00'],"['2007/11/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['67/22/10677 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-1118 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2007 Nov 15;67(22):10677-85. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-1118.,,"['CA021765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA072999/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several stemness factors, such as Notch or telomerase, show differential activation in normal hematopoietic versus leukemia stem cells. These differences could be exploited therapeutically even with drugs that are already in clinical use for the treatment of leukemia.

In this study, we compared the thermal stabilities of AMV RT and MMLV RT by observing their irreversible thermal inactivation. The temperatures reducing initial activity by 50% in 10-min incubation, T(50), of AMV RT were 47 degrees C without the template-primer (T/P), poly(rA)-p(dT)(12-18), and 52 degrees C with the T/P (28 microM).

Such activation was not observed in MMLV RT. These results suggest that AMV RT and MMLV RT are different in the following: (i) The intrinsic thermal stability of AMV RT is higher than that of MMLV RT; (ii) AMV RT is activated by thermal treatment with the T/P at 45-48 degrees C; and (iii) AMV RT is stabilized by the T/P more potently than MMLV RT.

Dysregulated c-myb gene expression is linked to the development of myeloid leukemia in mice and is predictive of poor prognosis in human colorectal cancer. Among the variety of post-translational modifications controlling the c-Myb protein, phosphorylation was shown to affect the transactivation activity and the rate of protein degradation. In this work we show that phosphorylation of c-Myb in response to stress led to rapid protein degradation, which occurred via a proteasome-dependent pathway. The kinases principally involved in this response were p38MAPK delta and, to a lesser extent, p38MAPK gamma. To assess whether c-Myb degradation was driven by changes in the overall level of phosphorylation or rather by phosphorylation at specific sites we systematically mutated potential sites of phosphorylation fulfilling the consensus for recognition by MAPKs (Ser/Thr-Pro). Among the point mutants examined, residues located downstream to the transactivation domain appeared to be essential for c-Myb stability. Particularly, mutation of Thr(354), Thr(486), Ser(556) and Thr(572) to Alanine conferred resistance to stress-induced degradation. The implications of c-Myb downregulation during inflammatory responses are discussed.","['Pani, Elisabetta', 'Ferrari, Stefano']","['Pani E', 'Ferrari S']","['Institute of Molecular Cancer Research, University of Zurich, Winterthurerstr. 190, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071119,United States,Blood Cells Mol Dis,"Blood cells, molecules & diseases",9509932,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Mutant Proteins)', '0 (Nucleic Acid Synthesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Protein Synthesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb)', '1W21G5Q4N2 (Okadaic Acid)', '6C74YM2NGI (Anisomycin)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 13)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anisomycin/pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 13/*metabolism', 'Mutant Proteins/*metabolism', 'Nucleic Acid Synthesis Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Okadaic Acid/pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Synthesis Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb/*metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Transfection']",2007/11/17 09:00,2008/08/06 09:00,['2007/11/17 09:00'],"['2007/09/18 00:00 [received]', '2007/09/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/11/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1079-9796(07)00222-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bcmd.2007.09.010 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Cells Mol Dis. 2008 May-Jun;40(3):388-94. doi: 10.1016/j.bcmd.2007.09.010.

The expression of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), encoded by the mdr gene, is often associated with multidrug resistance (MDR) to unrelated chemotherapeutic drugs in cancer cells. Here, we demonstrate that curcumin down-regulates P-gp expression in multidrug-resistant L1210/Adr cells. Transfection with a series of 5'-deleted constructs of the mdr1b gene promoter indicated that a proximal region between -205 and +42 of the sequence was responsible for the suppression of promoter activity by curcumin. This response might be associated with the inhibition of the phosphatidyinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) signaling pathway by curcumin. Moreover, curcumin reversed the MDR of the L1210/Adr cells. Thus, curcumin can contribute to the reversal of the MDR phenotype, probably due to the suppression of P-gp expression via the inhibition of the PI3K/Akt/NF-kappa B signaling pathway.","['Choi, Byeong Hyeok', 'Kim, Chang Gun', 'Lim, Yoongho', 'Shin, Soon Young', 'Lee, Young Han']","['Choi BH', 'Kim CG', 'Lim Y', 'Shin SY', 'Lee YH']","['Department of Biomedical Science and Technology, IBST, Konkuk University, Seoul 143-701, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071119,Ireland,Cancer Lett,Cancer letters,7600053,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (P-glycoprotein 2)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'IT942ZTH98 (Curcumin)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B/genetics/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Curcumin/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Down-Regulation', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Leukemia L1210/*drug therapy/enzymology/metabolism', 'Mice', 'NF-kappa B/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*metabolism', 'Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/drug effects', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*metabolism', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Transfection']",2007/11/17 09:00,2008/03/14 09:00,['2007/11/17 09:00'],"['2007/05/26 00:00 [received]', '2007/09/30 00:00 [revised]', '2007/10/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/11/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/14 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0304-3835(07)00470-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.canlet.2007.10.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Lett. 2008 Jan 18;259(1):111-8. doi: 10.1016/j.canlet.2007.10.003.

Our objective was to examine the effects of retinol or 4-oxoretinol on cellular retinoic acid binding protein (CRABP) I and II mRNA levels and retinol metabolism. ES cells were cultured with or without LIF, and with various doses of all-trans-retinol, all-trans-4-oxoretinol, or all-trans-retinoic acid (RA). In ES cells treated with retinol or 4-oxoretinol in the absence of LIF the CRABP-I (Crabp1, NM_013496; GI:7304974) and CRABP-II (Crabp2, NM_007759; GI:33469074) mRNA levels at 72h were 66+/-4 and 413+/-6 fold higher, respectively, than the levels in control ES cells cultured without retinoids and in the presence of LIF. The increase in CRABPI mRNA occurred through an increase in CRABPI gene transcription. CRABPI protein was also increased by >50-fold in cells treated with retinol in the absence of LIF. However [(3)H]4-oxoretinol does not bind to murine CRABPI or CRABPII. CYP26A1 mRNA levels and [(3)H]4-oxoretinol production from [(3)H]retinol increased in cells cultured without LIF and with exogenous retinoids. The enormous increases in CRABPI and II transcripts ( approximately 60 and 400-fold, respectively) in the absence of LIF may regulate aspects of the ES cell differentiation program in response to retinol.","['Lane, Michelle A', 'Xu, Juliana', 'Wilen, Elana W', 'Sylvester, Renia', 'Derguini, Fadila', 'Gudas, Lorraine J']","['Lane MA', 'Xu J', 'Wilen EW', 'Sylvester R', 'Derguini F', 'Gudas LJ']","['Department of Human Ecology, Division of Nutritional Sciences, The University of Texas at Austin, GEA 117, A2700 Austin, TX 78712, USA. mlane@mail.utexas.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20071006,Ireland,Mol Cell Endocrinol,Molecular and cellular endocrinology,7500844,"['0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (retinoic acid binding protein I, cellular)', '0 (retinoic acid binding protein II, cellular)', '11103-57-4 (Vitamin A)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '62702-55-0 (4-oxoretinol)', '9035-51-2 (Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (Cyp26a1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (Retinoic Acid 4-Hydroxylase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System/biosynthesis', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Enzyme Induction/drug effects', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Protein Binding', 'RNA, Messenger/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/genetics/*metabolism', 'Retinoic Acid 4-Hydroxylase', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription, Genetic/*drug effects', 'Transfection', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Up-Regulation', 'Vitamin A/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/pharmacology']",2007/11/17 09:00,2008/02/15 09:00,['2007/11/17 09:00'],"['2007/05/07 00:00 [received]', '2007/08/30 00:00 [revised]', '2007/09/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/11/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/15 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0303-7207(07)00365-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.mce.2007.09.010 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Endocrinol. 2008 Jan 2;280(1-2):63-74. doi: 10.1016/j.mce.2007.09.010.

Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) plays important roles in regulating cell death, immune response, and inflammation. However, the role of soluble TRAIL (sTRAIL) after SCT is poorly understood. In this study, 42 patients underwent SCT; 22 patients received allogeneic SCT, while the remaining 20 received autologous SCT. In these patients, levels of sTRAIL, cytokines, and soluble factors were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In addition, a basic study of the generation of endothelial cell-derived microparticle (EDMP) by TNF-alpha and soluble Fas ligand (sFasL) was conducted. sFasL and EDMP exhibited significant elevation in the early phase (2-3 weeks) after SCT. In addition, the elevation of IL-6, TNF-alpha, and sIL-2R after allogeneic SCT was observed. EDMP also exhibited changes similar to sFasL. The patients with high sTRAIL exhibited significant decrease of sFasL and EDMP as compared with those without high sTRAIL. TNF-alpha and sFasL induced an increase in procoagulant and apoptotic markers in endothelial cells, and EDMP shedding was observed. Furthermore, sTRAIL inhibited the EDMP elevation caused by TNF-alpha and sFasL. The apoptotic markers such as sFasL and sTRAIL exhibited particular changes after SCT. Our results suggest that sTRAIL generation after allogeneic SCT relates to the prevention of GVHD.","['Nomura, Shosaku', 'Ishii, Kazuyoshi', 'Inami, Norihito', 'Uoshima, Nobuhiko', 'Ishida, Hiroyuki', 'Yoshihara, Takao', 'Kitayama, Hitoshi', 'Hayashi, Kunio']","['Nomura S', 'Ishii K', 'Inami N', 'Uoshima N', 'Ishida H', 'Yoshihara T', 'Kitayama H', 'Hayashi K']","['Division of Hematology, Kishiwada City Hospital, 1001, Kishiwada, Osaka 596-8501, Japan. shosaku-n@mbp.ocn.ne.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20070615,Netherlands,Transpl Immunol,Transplant immunology,9309923,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Endothelial Growth Factors)', '0 (FASLG protein, human)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNFSF10 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Cytokines/blood/immunology', 'Endothelial Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Endothelial Growth Factors/blood/immunology', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay/methods', 'Fas Ligand Protein/blood/immunology', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/blood/immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/immunology/therapy', 'Lymphoma/immunology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects/methods', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/blood/*immunology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/biosynthesis/immunology']",2007/11/17 09:00,2008/06/05 09:00,['2007/11/17 09:00'],"['2007/05/05 00:00 [received]', '2007/05/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/11/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/05 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0966-3274(07)00113-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.trim.2007.05.012 [doi]']",ppublish,Transpl Immunol. 2007 Nov;18(2):115-21. doi: 10.1016/j.trim.2007.05.012.

Normally, rapid self-renewal of gut epithelia, which occurs by a balance of progenitor proliferation and pit cell apoptosis, serves as a host defense mechanism to limit bacterial colonization. To investigate how Hp overcomes this host defense, we use the Mongolian gerbil model of Hp infection. Apoptotic loss of pit cells induced by a proapoptotic agent is suppressed by Hp. The ability of Hp to suppress apoptosis contributed to pit hyperplasia and persistent bacterial colonization of the stomach. Infection with WT Hp but not with a mutant in the virulence effector cagA increased levels of the prosurvival factor phospho-ERK and antiapoptotic protein MCL1 in the gastric pits. Thus, CagA activates host cell survival and antiapoptotic pathways to overcome self-renewal of the gastric epithelium and help sustain Hp infection.","['Mimuro, Hitomi', 'Suzuki, Toshihiko', 'Nagai, Shigenori', 'Rieder, Gabriele', 'Suzuki, Masato', 'Nagai, Takeshi', 'Fujita, Yukihiro', 'Nagamatsu, Kanna', 'Ishijima, Nozomi', 'Koyasu, Shigeo', 'Haas, Rainer', 'Sasakawa, Chihiro']","['Mimuro H', 'Suzuki T', 'Nagai S', 'Rieder G', 'Suzuki M', 'Nagai T', 'Fujita Y', 'Nagamatsu K', 'Ishijima N', 'Koyasu S', 'Haas R', 'Sasakawa C']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo 108-8639, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cell Host Microbe,Cell host & microbe,101302316,"['0 (Antigens, Bacterial)', '0 (Bacterial Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (cagA protein, Helicobacter pylori)', 'EC 3.1.3.- (B59 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Bacterial/*physiology', '*Apoptosis/physiology', 'Bacterial Proteins/*physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Gerbillinae', 'Helicobacter Infections/metabolism/*microbiology/pathology', 'Helicobacter pylori/genetics/*growth & development', 'Humans', 'Hyperplasia/pathology', 'Intestinal Mucosa/microbiology/pathology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Up-Regulation']",2007/11/17 09:00,2007/12/28 09:00,['2007/11/17 09:00'],"['2007/01/04 00:00 [received]', '2007/08/11 00:00 [revised]', '2007/09/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/11/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/28 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1931-3128(07)00220-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.chom.2007.09.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Host Microbe. 2007 Oct 11;2(4):250-63. doi: 10.1016/j.chom.2007.09.005.,,,['Cell Host Microbe. 2007 Oct 11;2(4):209-11.

The optimal therapeutic procedures have not been well established. PATIENTS AND METHOD: Seven cases of NE diagnosed and treated in a tertiary hospital between 2000 and 2007 are described. Their clinico-biological characteristics, therapeutic procedures and evolution were analysed retrospectively. RESULTS: Five of the patients were males, their median age was 39 years. Acute myeloblastic leukemia was the most frequent diagnosis (5 cases). Two other patients had received an stem cell transplantation. Abdominal pain was present in all patients, diarrhoea in 6, and fever in 5. Microorganisms were isolated from blood cultures in 4 cases (Clostridium septicum, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Aeromonas hydrophila). Abnormal mural thickening of the caecum was observed in the 6 cases in which a computed tomography scan could be performed. The median mural thickness at its maximum section was 11 mm (range: 8-16). All patients first received medical treatment with wide spectrum antibiotics and intestinal rest, and abdominal surgery was indicated in 6 cases after a median time from first symptom of 4 days (range: 0-12). NE was confirmed histologically in all 6 patients. Five patients required admission in Intensive Care Unit and 2 (29%) died as a result of NE. CONCLUSIONS: NE is a severe complication of patients with hematologic malignancies submitted to intensive chemotherapy or receiving stem cell transplantation. Abdominal computed tomography scan is the most valuable diagnostic tool. Prompt surgical intervention may improve the prognosis in patients with NE.","['Batlle, Montserrat', 'Vall-Llovera, Ferran', 'Bechini, Jordi', 'Camps, Ignasi', 'Marcos, Pilar', 'Vives, Susana', 'Oriol, Albert', 'Ribera, Josep-Maria']","['Batlle M', 'Vall-Llovera F', 'Bechini J', 'Camps I', 'Marcos P', 'Vives S', 'Oriol A', 'Ribera JM']","[""Servicio de Hematologia Clinica.

The occurrence of BL/L with an immature phenotype raises the question whether this phenotype might be a consequence of early B-cell transformation or, alternatively, a secondary feature of transformed, mature B cells. It also poses important clinical questions regarding diagnosis and therapeutic procedures. Here we describe the case of a 4-yr-old child with BL/L and FAB L3 morphology, with phenotypic and genotypic characteristics of a CD10+ precursor B-cell acute lymphoid leukaemia (ALL) associated with t(8;14)(q24;q32). Molecular analysis showed expression of RAG1 and RAG2 and an unmutated VDJCmu immunoglobulin rearrangement coinciding with a lack of AICDA expression, indicating an immature B-cell origin. His clinical response suggested that FAB L3 ALL with MYC rearrangement and an aberrant precursor B-cell phenotype is clinically similar to BL/L. Moreover, short, intensive chemotherapeutic protocols seemed to be beneficial. This case also allowed us to refine the description of cellular and molecular variants of BL/L regarding the cell origin and pathogenesis of this biologically heterogeneous disease.","['Hassan, Rocio', 'Felisbino, Fabricio', 'Stefanoff, Claudio Gustavo', 'Pires, Virginia', 'Klumb, Claudete E', 'Dobbin, Jane', 'Seuanez, Hector N', 'Renault, Ilana Zalcberg']","['Hassan R', 'Felisbino F', 'Stefanoff CG', 'Pires V', 'Klumb CE', 'Dobbin J', 'Seuanez HN', 'Renault IZ']","['Bone Marrow Transplantation Centre (CEMO), Instituto Nacional de Cancer, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. biomol@inca.gov.br']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071115,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)'],IM,"['Burkitt Lymphoma/*diagnosis/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/metabolism/*pathology', 'Child, Preschool', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Gene Fusion', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Heavy Chain', 'Genes, myc', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/metabolism/*pathology', 'Precursor Cells, B-Lymphoid/metabolism/*pathology']",2007/11/17 09:00,2008/03/04 09:00,['2007/11/17 09:00'],"['2007/11/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/04 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['EJH992 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0609.2007.00992.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2008 Mar;80(3):265-70. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2007.00992.x.

Residual risk, however, is now so low in some countries that it can only be estimated by mathematical modeling. With hierarchical Bayesian methods, this study estimates the residual risk of transfusion-transmitted infections in Santa Catarina, Brazil. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Data from the six state blood collection services covering Santa Catarina between 1998 and 2002 were used. Information was obtained on donor profiles, screening and confirmatory test results, and records of all allogeneic blood donations for repeat donors. Residual risk estimates of hepatitis B virus (HBV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV) were separately derived from posterior distributions of incidence rates and preseroconversion window-period lengths. RESULTS: Estimated risks of a donation infectious for HBV and HIV entering the blood supply are 1:10,700 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1:4900-1:28,200) and 1:26,200 (95% CI, 1:14,800-1:64,100) donations, respectively. Estimated risks for HCV and HTLV were 1:19,300 (95% CI, 1:10,400-1:44,800) and 1:116,300 (95% CI, 1:40,200-1:1,000,000) donations, respectively. HBV risk is 1.8 times greater than HCV risk, 2.4 times greater than HIV risk, and 10.8 times that of HTLV. Actual risks would be lower due to immune recipients and subinfectious levels of undetected viremia. CONCLUSION: The major factor contributing to risk differences between Santa Catarina and countries with similar testing regimes is the much higher source population diseases prevalence. Payoff for nucleic acid testing would be low, thus additional investment in safety should be based on studies of the cost-effectiveness of different strategies to reduce overall transmission.","['Maresch, Christina', 'Schluter, Philip J', 'Wilson, Andrew D', 'Sleigh, Adrian']","['Maresch C', 'Schluter PJ', 'Wilson AD', 'Sleigh A']","['School of Population Health and the School of Nursing and Midwifery University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071113,United States,Transfusion,Transfusion,0417360,['0 (Biomarkers)'],IM,"['Biomarkers', '*Blood Donors', '*Blood Transfusion', 'Brazil', '*Disease Transmission, Infectious', 'Humans', 'Mass Screening', 'Prevalence', 'Risk Factors', 'Transfusion Reaction']",2007/11/17 09:00,2008/03/29 09:00,['2007/11/17 09:00'],"['2007/11/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/29 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['TRF01521 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1537-2995.2007.01521.x [doi]']",ppublish,Transfusion. 2008 Feb;48(2):273-81. doi: 10.1111/j.1537-2995.2007.01521.x.

Here, we used promyelocytic leukaemia PLB-985 cells differentiated with dimethylsulfoxide (PLB-985D) toward neutrophil-like phenotype to investigate the IL-4/IL-4R system. PLB-985 cells did not express CD132 (gammac) but expressed the complete IL-4 type II receptor (IL-4Ralpha and IL-13Ralpha1). Moreover, PLB-985 cells lost surface expression of IL-13Ralpha1 during differentiation, resulting in PLB-985D cells expressing only IL-4Ralpha fully responsive to IL-4, as judged by activation of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases and Janus kinase 1. IL-4 also increased suppressor of cytokine signalling 3 (SOCS3) protein level in the presence of the proteasome inhibitor MG132 exclusively in PLB-985D cells. As the IL-4Ralpha chain has been associated with a component of the phagocyte NADPH oxidase, we used PLB-985-gp91(phox) deficient cells (mimicking chronic granulomatous disease, X-CGD), to investigate the IL-4/IL-4R system in X-CGD-D cells. IL-4 was found to activate MAP kinases in X-CGD-D cells but did not up-regulate SOCS3, in contrast to granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and IL-6. Utilization of catalase, cycloheximide and genistein inhibitors showed that IL-4 induced SOCS3 by a mechanism dependent on a complete NADPH oxidase complex, protein synthesis and tyrosine phosphorylation, but independent of production of reactive oxygen species. We conclude that IL-4 induces cell signalling in promyelocytes expressing only IL-4Ralpha.","['Ratthe, Claude', 'Girard, Denis']","['Ratthe C', 'Girard D']","['INRS-Institut Armand-Frappier, Universite du Quebec, Pointe-Claire, QC, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071112,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-4)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (CYBB protein, human)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (NADPH Oxidase 2)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (NADPH Oxidases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 1)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Cell Communication/physiology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*drug effects/pathology', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-4/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Janus Kinase 1/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/metabolism/*pathology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/deficiency', 'NADPH Oxidase 2', 'NADPH Oxidases/deficiency', 'Neutrophils/metabolism/pathology', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphorylation', 'Receptors, Interleukin-4/*metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins/*metabolism', 'Tyrosine/metabolism']",2007/11/17 09:00,2008/04/24 09:00,['2007/11/17 09:00'],"['2007/11/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/24 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['BJH6886 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2007.06886.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2008 Jan;140(1):59-70. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2007.06886.x.

Shiga toxins have also been shown to induce apoptosis in epithelial, endothelial and monocytic cells. The precise relationship between protein synthesis inhibition and induction of apoptosis is not known. We show that stimulation of the myelogenous leukaemia cell line THP-1 with purified Stx1 induced the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response. Stx1 treatment increased activation of the ER stress sensors IRE1, PERK and ATF6. Toxin treatment increased expression of the transcriptional regulator CHOP and the death domain-containing receptor DR5 at mRNA and protein levels. Following Stx1 intoxication, levels of the survival factor Bcl-2 decreased, while secretion of the death-inducing ligand TRAIL increased. Stx1 enzymatic activity was required for optimal activation of PERK and ATF6, but not IRE1. ER stress elicited by Stx1 increased the release of Ca(2+) from ER stores and the activation of the protease calpain. Inhibition of calpain activity led to reductions in Stx1-induced cleavage of procaspase-8 and apoptosis. Collectively, these data suggest that Shiga toxins trigger monocytic cell apoptosis through the ER stress response, the increased expression of DR5 and TRAIL, and activation of caspase-8 via a calpain-dependent mechanism.","['Lee, Sang-Yun', 'Lee, Moo-Seung', 'Cherla, Rama P', 'Tesh, Vernon L']","['Lee SY', 'Lee MS', 'Cherla RP', 'Tesh VL']","['Department of Microbial and Molecular Pathogenesis, Texas A&M University Health Science Center, College Station, Texas 77843-1114, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20071113,England,Cell Microbiol,Cellular microbiology,100883691,"['0 (ATF6 protein, human)', '0 (Activating Transcription Factor 6)', '0 (DDIT3 protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (Shiga Toxin 1)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNFSF10 protein, human)', '147336-12-7 (Transcription Factor CHOP)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (ERN2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (PERK kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (eIF-2 Kinase)', 'EC 3.1.- (Endoribonucleases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Calpain)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Activating Transcription Factor 6/metabolism', '*Apoptosis', 'Blotting, Western', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Calpain/metabolism', 'Caspase 8/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Down-Regulation', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum/*drug effects', 'Endoribonucleases/metabolism', 'Escherichia coli/*pathogenicity', 'Humans', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism', 'Monocytes/*drug effects', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Shiga Toxin 1/isolation & purification/*toxicity', 'Shigella dysenteriae/*pathogenicity', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/metabolism', 'Transcription Factor CHOP', 'Up-Regulation', 'eIF-2 Kinase/metabolism']",2007/11/17 09:00,2008/03/18 09:00,['2007/11/17 09:00'],"['2007/11/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/18 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['CMI1083 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1462-5822.2007.01083.x [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Microbiol. 2008 Mar;10(3):770-80. doi: 10.1111/j.1462-5822.2007.01083.x.

Based on the expression of these antigens, we identified counterparts of TEL/AML1(pos) and TEL/AML1(neg) leukemic cells in nonmalignant bone marrow. Although CD27 is known as a marker of mature memory B cells, we recently showed that CD27 is also expressed by malignant and nonmalignant B precursors. Here, we show that CD27 and CD44 delineate stages of B-precursor development. Well-established differentiation markers showed that the developmental sequence starts from undetermined progenitors, expressing CD44. Upon B-lineage commitment, cells gain CD27 and lose CD44. The CD27(pos)CD44(neg) (CD27 single positive, 27SP) cells are the earliest stage within CD10(pos)CD19(pos) B precursors and express RAG-1 and TDT. These cells correspond to TEL/AML1(pos) ALL (1/4 pediatric B-precursor ALL). The development follows to CD27/CD44 double-positive (27/44DP) stage, 44SP stage and CD27/CD44 double-negative (27/44DN) stage. Before exit to periphery, CD44 is reexpressed. The 27/44DP cells are mostly large and profoundly suppress RAG-1. Despite their presumably high proliferation potential, 27/44DP cells rarely dominate in leukemia. At 44SP stage, which corresponds to TEL/AML1(neg) leukemias, RAG-1 is reexpressed and Ig light chain gene starts to be rearranged.","['Vaskova, M', 'Fronkova, E', 'Starkova, J', 'Kalina, T', 'Mejstrikova, E', 'Hrusak, O']","['Vaskova M', 'Fronkova E', 'Starkova J', 'Kalina T', 'Mejstrikova E', 'Hrusak O']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, 2nd Medical School, Charles University Prague, Prague, Czech Republic. martina.vaskova@lfmotol.cuni.cz']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071113,England,Tissue Antigens,Tissue antigens,0331072,"['0 (Hyaluronan Receptors)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily, Member 7)']",IM,"['Child', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Hyaluronan Receptors/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/diagnosis/genetics/*immunology', 'Lymphopoiesis/genetics/*immunology', 'Precursor Cells, B-Lymphoid/cytology/*immunology/pathology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily, Member 7/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology']",2007/11/17 09:00,2008/05/01 09:00,['2007/11/17 09:00'],"['2007/11/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/01 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['TAN968 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1399-0039.2007.00968.x [doi]']",ppublish,Tissue Antigens. 2008 Jan;71(1):57-66. doi: 10.1111/j.1399-0039.2007.00968.x.

Imatinib is an inhibitor of human equilibrative transporters (hENTs), which are responsible for the intracellular uptake of fludarabine. METHODS: Intracellular accumulation of fludarabine triphosphate (F-ara-ATP), the active metabolite of fludarabine, was measured in CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-lymphocytes isolated from healthy volunteers, which were treated in vitro with fludarabine alone, and in the presence of either imatinib or NBMPR, a known hENT inhibitor. RESULTS: Imatinib significantly inhibited F-ara-ATP accumulation in CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-lymphocytes in a concentration-dependent manner. The observed imatinib inhibition was comparable to inhibition observed with NBMPR. The inhibition of F-ara-ATP by imatinib is likely due to inhibition of nucleoside transporters hENT1 and hENT2. CONCLUSIONS: There is significant in vitro drug interaction between imatinib and fludarabine. This effect may be of important consideration in patients receiving fludarabine-based conditioning prior to HCT.","['Woodahl, Erica L', 'Wang, Joanne', 'Heimfeld, Shelly', 'Ren, Aaron G', 'McCune, Jeannine S']","['Woodahl EL', 'Wang J', 'Heimfeld S', 'Ren AG', 'McCune JS']","['Department of Pharmacy, University of Washington, Box 357630, Seattle, WA 98195, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071115,Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '46S541971T (Thioinosine)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'GV1L2DZM2Z (4-nitrobenzylthioinosine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Benzamides', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/metabolism', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Interactions', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Piperazines/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Thioinosine/analogs & derivatives/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Vidarabine/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/pharmacology']",2007/11/16 09:00,2008/10/22 09:00,['2007/11/16 09:00'],"['2007/08/03 00:00 [received]', '2007/10/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/11/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/22 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/16 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00280-007-0629-y [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2008 Sep;62(4):735-9. doi: 10.1007/s00280-007-0629-y.

In a patient-donor model system with HLA class I disparities, we identified an HLA-B*44 mismatch allele, HLA-B*4405, as the dominant target of alloreactive T cells expanded in vitro from donor peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). HLA-B*4405-reactive T cells were detectable after multiple in vitro stimulations in the patient's post-HSCT PBMC. In a patient-donor model with full HLA compatibility, the major target antigen of donor lymphocytes stimulated in vitro with the respective patient's pre-HSCT PBMC was restricted by HLA-A*0201 and was encoded by TRIM22-442 C, a newly detected polymorphic allele of the tripartite motif family member TRIM22 (synonym: STAF50), preferentially expressed in cells of the haematopoietic system. An arginine(R)-to-cysteine(C) exchange at position 442 generated an immunogenic T cell epitope equivalent to a minor histocompatibility antigen (mHag). TRIM22-442C-specific T cells persisted long-term in the patient's post-HSCT PBMC. Approximately, 1.3% of Caucasians carry TRIM22.442 C in association with HLA-A*0201. In particular, the knowledge of a large and diverse panel of such mHags may be crucial for further improvement of donor selection and adoptive T cell transfer strategies.

Anthracyclines and other high-dose chemotherapy represent the greatest risk. The aim of the study was to assess cardiotoxicity during preparative regimen (PR) and hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) in acute leukemia (AL) with biochemical markers - ""N-terminal pro brain natriuretic peptide"" (NT-proBNP), cardiac troponin T (cTnT) and creatine kinase MB (CK-MB mass). METHODS: Nineteen adult AL patients previously treated with anthracyclines--idarubicine, daunorubicine, mitoxantrone with standard doses for a cycle as 3 x 12 mg/m(2), 3 x 50 mg/m(2), 3 x 10 mg/m(2) accordingly were studied. PR consisted of high-dose cyclophosphamide (HD-C) in combination with busulphan or total body irradiation (TBI). Plasma NT-proBNP, cTnT and CK-MB mass concentrations were measured the day before PR, the day after PR, the day after HCT and 14 days after HCT. RESULTS: Before PR, mean plasma NT-proBNP value was 106.3+/-55.7 ng/l. After PR, it increased to 426.1+/-391.5 ng/l. After HCT, a further increase to 847.6+/-780.6 ng/l was observed. Fourteen days after HCT, the mean NT-proBNP was 330.8+/-236.8 ng/l. The differences were statistically significant in comparison with the baseline values (p<0.01). The NT-proBNP elevations were more pronounced in patients with cumulative doses (CD) of anthracyclines above 450 mg/m(2) (p<0.05), in patients with PR containing HD-C and TBI (p<0.05). In all patients, plasma cTnT and CK-MB mass concentrations remained unchangable during PR and HCT. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that administration of PR and HCT is in most AL patients associated with acute neurohumoral activation (significant rise in NT-proBNP). Persistent NT-proBNP elevations, in our study in 12 (63.2%) patients, indicate subclinical cardiotoxicity (risk for development of heart failure) and require further follow-up. More pronounced NT-proBNP elevations in patients with higher CD of anthracyclines and in patients with PR containing combination of HD-C and TBI confirm that these therapeutic procedures seem to be more cardiotoxic and not very appropriate for patients with cumulation of risk factors for cardiotoxicity. Negative plasma cTnT and CK-MB mass concentrations show no detectable damage of cardiomyocyte structure during PR and HCT.","['Horacek, J M', 'Pudil, R', 'Tichy, M', 'Jebavy, L', 'Zak, P', 'Slovacek, L', 'Maly, J']","['Horacek JM', 'Pudil R', 'Tichy M', 'Jebavy L', 'Zak P', 'Slovacek L', 'Maly J']","['2nd Department of Medicine--Clinical Hematology, University Hospital and Charles University, Faculty of Medicine in Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic. jan.hor@post.cz']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Ukraine,Exp Oncol,Experimental oncology,101230541,"['0 (Anthracyclines)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Myeloablative Agonists)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Troponin T)', '0 (pro-brain natriuretic peptide (1-76))', '114471-18-0 (Natriuretic Peptide, Brain)', 'EC 2.7.3.2 (Creatine Kinase, MB Form)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Anthracyclines/adverse effects', 'Biomarkers/*blood', 'Creatine Kinase, MB Form/blood', 'Echocardiography', 'Female', 'Heart Diseases/*chemically induced', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Male', 'Myeloablative Agonists/*adverse effects', 'Natriuretic Peptide, Brain/blood', 'Peptide Fragments/blood', 'Troponin T/blood']",2007/11/16 09:00,2008/01/01 09:00,['2007/11/16 09:00'],"['2007/11/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/01 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/16 09:00 [entrez]']",['32/639 [pii]'],ppublish,Exp Oncol. 2007 Sep;29(3):243-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Immunoglobulin variable heavy chain (IGHV) gene repertoire was studied in 189 CLL patients using reverse transcribed polymerase chain reaction and direct sequence of amplified products. RESULTS: IGHV3-21 gene expression was found in 11 cases (5.8%), and its frequency was intermediate between Scandinavian (11.7%) and Mediterranean CLL (2.9%) cohorts. The most of cases (9 of 11) belonged to subset with heterogeneous HCDR3 (heteroHCDR3 subset), and only 2 cases--to subset with classical short ARDANGMDV motif (homHCDR3 subset). Six IGHV3-21 cases were mutated and 5 cases were unmutated. All unmutated cases (all were from heteroHCDR3 subset) had similarity of their HCDR3s with previously published sequences. The differences in overall (OS), progression-free (PFS) and treatment-free survival (TFS) for IGHV3-21 positive patients in comparison with CLL patients expressing the other IGHV genes were statistically insignificant. These survival parameters were comparable also for CLL patients with mutated IGHV3-21 gene usage and expression the others mutated IGHV genes. But remarkable feature of IGHV3-21 expressing patients was high incidence of solid tumors. They have developed in 4 IGHV3-21 positive cases (36.4%) and in 10 cases with expression of the others IGHV genes (5.6%, p=0.0002). Furthermore, in small group of 6 patients with mutated IGHV3-21 gene expression, 3 patients had solid tumors and one underwent Richter transformation. Unmutated IGHV3-21 gene expressed patients had worse OS and PFS in comparison with CLL patients that expressed the others unmutated IGHV genes. CONCLUSION: Presented data are in agreement with the opinion about negative prognostic significance of IGHV3-21 gene expression regardless its mutation status.

B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia is one of the diseases in which these processes are altered. AIM: The aim of our study was the assessment of cannabinoid receptor expression on the B-lymphocytes in bone marrow trephine biopsy from leukaemic patients at diagnosis and after purine analogue treatment. METHODS: The biopsy was taken routinely and standard immunohistochemical staining procedure for paraffin embedded sections was applied. The cannabinoid receptors were detected using specific primary polyclonal antibody anti-CB1 and anti-CB2. Additionally, an existence of cannabinoid receptors was confirmed by flow cytometry. RESULTS: The results showed that the expression of CB1 receptor on the surface of neoplastic cells was lower than that of CB2 (17.0+/-3.1% and 92.1+/-1.7% respectively, p<0.001). Nine of the patients responded to applied treatment with a reduction in leukaemic infiltration (77.2+/-6.9% to 30.2+/-6.5%, p=0.007) and CB1 receptor expression (24.4+/-4.8% to 8.6+/-2.9%, p=0.01), but there was no change in CB2 expression (91.7+/-2.7% vs 90.9+/-2.8%, p=0.69). Four patients without remission expressed even greater number of the receptors. In all of the cases both cannabinoid receptor types antibodies gave positive reaction. Furthermore, the existence of cannabinoid receptors on neoplastic lymphocytes was confirmed by flow cytometry. CONCLUSION: The study provides original evidence for the existence of cannabinoid receptors on B-lymphocytes in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia patients. The receptors are thought to be a new structure that can modify the course of the disease and may be considered as a new target in leukaemia treatment.","['Piszcz, J A', 'Lemancewicz, D', 'Kloczko, J', 'Dzieciol, J', 'Rusak, M', 'Dabrowska, M']","['Piszcz JA', 'Lemancewicz D', 'Kloczko J', 'Dzieciol J', 'Rusak M', 'Dabrowska M']","['Department of Haematology, Medical University of Bialystok, 15-276 Bialystok, Poland. jarotrot@gmail.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Ukraine,Exp Oncol,Experimental oncology,101230541,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Purines)', '0 (Receptors, Cannabinoid)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'B-Lymphocytes/drug effects/metabolism', 'Biopsy', 'Bone Marrow Cells/drug effects', 'Cladribine/*therapeutic use', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Purines/agonists', 'Receptors, Cannabinoid/*biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Vidarabine/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use']",2007/11/16 09:00,2008/01/01 09:00,['2007/11/16 09:00'],"['2007/11/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/01 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/16 09:00 [entrez]']",['32/635 [pii]'],ppublish,Exp Oncol. 2007 Sep;29(3):221-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They may appear de novo and without obvious cause (primary or de novo MDS) or be induced by certain mutagenic environmental or therapeutic toxins (secondary MDS). Excessive exposures to benzene are generally considered to be a potential environmental risk factor for both MDS and acute myeloid leukemia. However, such risk is unproven for each disease component within the MDS classification. A critical review of the refractory sideroblastic disorders strongly suggests that benzene exposure is not a potential cause of this distinct and still-evolving subset of MDS.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between July 2002 and July 2006, 127 chest ports were placed in 122 pediatric patients (80 boys, 42 girls). Five patients underwent port implantation twice. The mean age of the patients was 8.5 years (range, 4 months to 18 years). The most common underlying disease was leukemia (66%). Internal jugular vein access was used in all patients. All types of anesthesia or sedation for the procedures were applied by anesthetists in the angiography suite. Retrospective evaluation of an electronic database and hospital charts was performed for the detailed follow-up. RESULTS: Technical success rate was 100%. The mean catheter life was 459 days (total, 51,373 d; range, 16-1,297 catheter-days). Overall, 82 ports are still in use, 10 patients are deceased, and eight (7.1%) and 12 (10.7%) ports were removed at the end of treatment or as a result of complications, respectively. One patient (0.9%) died 167 days after port implantation as a result of unconfirmed port-related sepsis. Eight ports (7.1%) were explanted as a result of infectious complications, three (2.7%) required removal for skin erosion, and one (0.9%) was explanted as a result of a broken catheter. The rate of confirmed overall port-related infection was 14.3%, or 0.31 infections per 1,000 catheter days. Fifteen patients were lost to follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Chest port placement by interventional radiologists in pediatric patients is safe, with a high rate of technical success and low rate of complications.","['Peynircioglu, Bora', 'Canyigit, Murat', 'Ergun, Onur', 'Pamuk, Gulsun Almula', 'Cil, Barbaros Erhan']","['Peynircioglu B', 'Canyigit M', 'Ergun O', 'Pamuk GA', 'Cil BE']","['Department of Radiology, Hacettepe University Hospitals, 06100, Sihhiye, Ankara, Turkey. borapeynir@gmail.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Vasc Interv Radiol,Journal of vascular and interventional radiology : JVIR,9203369,,IM,"['Catheterization, Central Venous/*adverse effects/*methods', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*diagnostic imaging/*surgery', 'Prognosis', 'Radiography, Interventional/*methods', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome']",2007/11/16 09:00,2008/01/30 09:00,['2007/11/16 09:00'],"['2007/11/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/30 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['18/11/1389 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jvir.2007.07.010 [doi]']",ppublish,J Vasc Interv Radiol. 2007 Nov;18(11):1389-94. doi: 10.1016/j.jvir.2007.07.010.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

IL-27Ra (IL-27R) is a type I cytokine receptor that functions as the ligand binding component of the receptor for IL-27 and functions with the glycoprotein 130 (gp130) coreceptor to induce signal transduction in response to IL-27. We show that IL-27R is expressed on the cell surface of the leukemic cells of AML patients. 32D myeloid cells transformed by IL-27R contain elevated levels of activated forms of various signaling proteins, including JAK1, JAK2, STAT1, STAT3, STAT5, and ERK1/2. Inhibition of JAK family proteins induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in these cells, suggesting the transforming properties of IL-27R depend on the activity of JAK family members. IL-27R also transforms BaF3 cells to cytokine independence. Because BaF3 cells lack expression of gp130, this finding suggests that IL-27R-mediated transformation of hematopoietic cells is gp130-independent. Finally, we show that IL-27R can functionally replace a homodimeric type I cytokine receptor in the activation of JAK2-V617F, a critical JAK2 mutation in various myeloproliferative disorders (MPDs). Our data demonstrate that IL-27R possesses hematopoietic cell-transforming properties and suggest that, analogous to homodimeric type I cytokine receptors, single-chain components of heterodimeric receptors can also enhance the activation of JAK2-V617F. Therefore, such receptors may play unappreciated roles in MPDs.","['Pradhan, Anuradha', 'Lambert, Que T', 'Reuther, Gary W']","['Pradhan A', 'Lambert QT', 'Reuther GW']","['Molecular Oncology Program, H.

However, this view does not fully reflect the molecular heterogeneity of the disease. We have analyzed both genetic (mutations of BRAF, KRAS, and p53 and microsatellite instability) and epigenetic alterations (DNA methylation of 27 CpG island promoter regions) in 97 primary colorectal cancer patients. Two clustering analyses on the basis of either epigenetic profiling or a combination of genetic and epigenetic profiling were performed to identify subclasses with distinct molecular signatures. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of the DNA methylation data identified three distinct groups of colon cancers named CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) 1, CIMP2, and CIMP negative. Genetically, these three groups correspond to very distinct profiles. CIMP1 are characterized by MSI (80%) and BRAF mutations (53%) and rare KRAS and p53 mutations (16% and 11%, respectively). CIMP2 is associated with 92% KRAS mutations and rare MSI, BRAF, or p53 mutations (0, 4, and 31% respectively). CIMP-negative cases have a high rate of p53 mutations (71%) and lower rates of MSI (12%) or mutations of BRAF (2%) or KRAS (33%). Clustering based on both genetic and epigenetic parameters also identifies three distinct (and homogeneous) groups that largely overlap with the previous classification. The three groups are independent of age, gender, or stage, but CIMP1 and 2 are more common in proximal tumors. Together, our integrated genetic and epigenetic analysis reveals that colon cancers correspond to three molecularly distinct subclasses of disease.","['Shen, Lanlan', 'Toyota, Minoru', 'Kondo, Yutaka', 'Lin, E', 'Zhang, Li', 'Guo, Yi', 'Hernandez, Natalie Supunpong', 'Chen, Xinli', 'Ahmed, Saira', 'Konishi, Kazuo', 'Hamilton, Stanley R', 'Issa, Jean-Pierre J']","['Shen L', 'Toyota M', 'Kondo Y', 'Lin E', 'Zhang L', 'Guo Y', 'Hernandez NS', 'Chen X', 'Ahmed S', 'Konishi K', 'Hamilton SR', 'Issa JP']","['Department of Leukemia, University of Texas M.

Proliferation assays performed on myeloid and lymphoid cell lines show that the three compounds inhibit cell growth of all cell types tested, with miyabenol C being the most efficient (IC50 ranging from 10.8 to 29.4 muM). Further analysis performed on the multiple myeloma cell line U266 shows that all compounds modify cell cycle distribution probably via actions on different targets. Whereas cells treated with resveratrol accumulate in S phase, cells treated with epsilon-viniferin and miyabenol C accumulate in G2/M and G0/G1, respectively. Miyabenol C is also the most efficient at inducing cell death in U266 cells. All compounds induce apoptosis of U266 cells via mechanisms entirely dependent on caspase activation and associated with mitochondrial membrane potential disruption. Compounds do not act directly on the mitochondrial membrane, but could induce activation of upstream caspases such as caspase 8 and/or caspase 2, depending on the compound. In no case did upstream caspase 8 activation involve Fas/FasL interaction. Taken together, these results show that epsilon-viniferin and, more importantly, miyabenol C represent potent antitumor agents that require further investigation, either alone or in combination with resveratrol.","['Barjot, Catherine', 'Tournaire, Magali', 'Castagnino, Chantal', 'Vigor, Claire', 'Vercauteren, Joseph', 'Rossi, Jean-Francois']","['Barjot C', 'Tournaire M', 'Castagnino C', 'Vigor C', 'Vercauteren J', 'Rossi JF']","['CellGen SA, INSERM U847, 99 rue Puech Villa, 34197 Montpellier Cedex 5, France.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20071012,Netherlands,Life Sci,Life sciences,0375521,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Stilbenes)', '0 (fas Receptor)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'Q369O8926L (Resveratrol)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects', 'Mitochondrial Membranes/drug effects', 'Plants/*chemistry', 'Resveratrol', 'Stilbenes/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'fas Receptor/physiology']",2007/11/16 09:00,2008/01/09 09:00,['2007/11/16 09:00'],"['2007/05/22 00:00 [received]', '2007/08/17 00:00 [revised]', '2007/08/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/11/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/09 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0024-3205(07)00755-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.lfs.2007.08.047 [doi]']",ppublish,Life Sci. 2007 Nov 30;81(23-24):1565-74. doi: 10.1016/j.lfs.2007.08.047.

METHODS: Real-time quantitative PCR was used to detect the TREC in 43 leukemia patients undergoing matched sibling donor bone marrow transplantation (MSD BMT), matched unrelated donor (MUD) BMT, or haploidentical-stem cell transplantation (HID-SCT), and in 70 normal individuals. RT-PCR was used to amplify 24 subfamily genes of T-cell receptor beta-chain variable region (TCRBV) in 24 of the 43 patients and 5 normal donors as control. The PCR products were further analyzed by genescane to evaluate the clonality of BV subfamily, characteristics of complementarity determining region 3 (CDR3), and the usage rate in BV subfamily. RESULTS: There were (335.1 +/- 782.5) copies/10(5) cells in the 43 patients before transplantation, far lower than the normal value. The TREC values of the patients of the 3 groups all decreased obviously 3 months after transplantation. The TREC value of the MSD-BMT group recovered faster than the other two groups and reached the value before transplantation in 24 months. The recovery of TREC value in the HID-BMT group was delayed. 3 - 19 months after transplantation, the usage of TCRBV subfamilies was still restricted. There were 6 - 16 BV subfamilies expressed and 33% - 48% of them were polyclonals, the others were monoclones and oligoclones and existed in 24 BV subfamilies, no common monoclone BV subfamilies was expressed. CONCLUSION: Investigation of the TREC and TCRBV clonal repertoire showed that the number of naive T cell is lower and the usage of TCRBV subfamilies skewed 3 - 24 months after allo-HSCT. The immune deficiency of the patients undergoing HID-BMT is more prominent and consistent with the clinical process.","['Fu, Yue-Wen', 'Wu, De-Pei', 'Cen, Jian-Nong', 'Feng, Yu-Feng', 'Chang, Wei-Rong', 'Qiu, Qiao-Cheng', 'Zhu, Zi-Ling', 'Zhu, Ping']","['Fu YW', 'Wu DP', 'Cen JN', 'Feng YF', 'Chang WR', 'Qiu QC', 'Zhu ZL', 'Zhu P']","['Department of Hematology, First Hospital Affiliated to Suzhou University, Suzhou 215006, China.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua yi xue za zhi,7511141,"['0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Clonal Deletion/genetics/immunology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics/*immunology/surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Postoperative Period', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/genetics/immunology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/genetics/*immunology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/metabolism']",2007/11/16 09:00,2008/05/16 09:00,['2007/11/16 09:00'],"['2007/11/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/16 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/16 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi. 2007 Aug 28;87(32):2265-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In these studies, only the A subunit (FXIII-A) was detectable in megakaryocytes/platelets and in monocytes/macrophages. We developed several novel monoclonal antibody clones directed to both subunits (FXIII-A and FXIII-B) and investigated their appearance in normal and leukemic cells. By using 3- and 4-color flow cytometry FXIII expression was investigated in normal peripheral blood and bone marrow samples and in acute myeloblastic (AML) and lymphoblastic (ALL) leukemia cases. Samples were studied by Western blotting and confocal laser scanning microscopy. With a previously published ELISA assay applying two monoclonal antibodies directed to different epitopes in FXIII-A, we were able to measure the intracytoplasmic content of FXIII-A in normal cells and leukemic blasts. FXIII-A was detectable in normal peripheral blood monocytes and in large quantities in platelets, but both cell types were negative for FXIII-B. There was no surface staining for FXIII-A, it only appeared intracellularly. In samples derived from patients with AML M4 and M5, FXIII-A sensitively identified blast cells. Although normal lymphocytes do not express FXIII-A, 40% of ALL cases showed significant FXIII-A expression as determined by flow cytometry. FXIII-A positivity of lymphoblasts was verified by Western blotting, ELISA, and confocal laser scanning microscopy cytometry. These data provide evidence that FXIII-A is a sufficiently sensitive marker in differentiating myeloblasts and monoblasts and is suitable for identifying leukemia-associated phenotypes in ALL.","['Kiss, Flora', 'Simon, Agnes', 'Csathy, Laszlo', 'Hevessy, Zsuzsanna', 'Katona, Eva', 'Kiss, Csongor', 'Kappelmayer, Janos']","['Kiss F', 'Simon A', 'Csathy L', 'Hevessy Z', 'Katona E', 'Kiss C', 'Kappelmayer J']","['Department of Clinical Biochemistry and Molecular Pathology, University of Debrecen, Hungary.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Cytometry A,Cytometry.

Based on altered expression of cell cycle regulatory proteins, including frequent p16 (INK4A) and p15 (INK4B) deletions, flavopiridol (FP; Alvocidib) is an attractive agent for relapsed ALL. PROCEDURE: We evaluated the efficacy of FP in ALL cell lines using cell proliferation assays, determined the effects of FP treatment on cell growth and viability in cell lines and patient samples, examined cell cycle kinetics, and evaluated the effect of FP on endogenous cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) activity, Mcl-1 expression, and RNA polymerase II expression and phosphorylation. RESULTS: ALL cell lines are sensitive to FP. At lower concentrations, FP induces transient G(1)-S cell cycle arrest and modest levels of apoptosis in cell lines. In contrast, a sustained G(1)-S and G(2)-M arrest and substantial apoptosis are observed following exposure to higher FP concentrations. After treatment with FP, ALL cell lines have decreased expression of retinoblastoma protein phosphorylated at serines 795 and 807/811, indicating reduced CDK activity. We also show that ALL cell lines are sensitive to clinically achievable concentrations of FP in medium supplemented with human serum and that FP reduces the expression of Mcl-1 and phosphorylated forms of the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II. FP also increases cell death by approximately twofold over baseline in primary ALL blasts.

MFC has been found particularly useful for assessment of early clearance of malignant cells and after consolidation therapy. At the latter checkpoint, MRD levels quantified by RQ-PCR in AML with fusion genes also have the strongest prognostic power. In addition, highly predictive initial expression levels have been identified by RQ-PCR. Both methods are capable of early detection of relapse. Through the use of all available markers including NPM1 mutations and FLT3 mutations in addition to fusion genes, RQ-PCR-based MRD assessment is possible in more than half of patients, whereas MFC is applicable to most AML cases. With a sensitivity of 10(-4) (PML-RARA) to 10(-7) (patient-specific primers, FLT3 and NPM1 mutations), RQ-PCR is more sensitive in most cases.

R306465 showed class I HDAC isotype selectivity as evidenced by poor inhibition of HDAC6 (class IIb) confirmed by the absence of downregulation of Hsp90 chaperone c-raf protein expression and tubulin acetylation. This distinguished it from other HDAC inhibitors currently in clinical development that were either more potent towards HDAC6 (e.g. vorinostat) or had a broader HDAC inhibition spectrum (e.g. panobinostat). R306465 potently inhibited cell proliferation of all main solid tumour indications, including ovarian, lung, colon, breast and prostate cancer cell lines, with IC50 values ranging from 30 to 300 nM. Haematological cell lines, including acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, acute myeloid leukaemia, chronic lymphoblastic leukaemia, chronic myeloid leukaemia, lymphoma and myeloma, were potently inhibited at a similar concentration range.

B-CLL typically contains chromosomal deletions and chromosomes 13q14 and 11q22-->q23 are the most common. These two regions appear to share a common ancestral origin (Auer et al., 2007b). Overall, chromosomal abnormalities can be found in the majority of patients with B-CLL when using sensitive techniques (Dohneret al., 2000) and possibly reflects an underlying predisposition, with a small but significant number of familial cases. Although single and consistent abnormalities are most common, multiple rearrangements can occur, often with disease progression (Feganetal., 1995; Dohner et al., 2000). Regions of recurrent deletion suggest the presence of tumor suppressor genes if following Knudson's theoretical 2-hit model. However, despite extensive sequencing analysis over the last decade and lack of pathogenic mutations identified, there has been a move away from this suggested hypothesis and alternative mechanisms of gene inactivation involving epigenetic silencing or haploinsufficiency may be considered as more likely in this disease. This review focuses on the common genetic abnormalities in B-CLL and relates them to some of the more recent hypotheses on inactivation of genes within these regions of deletion.","['Cotter, F E', 'Auer, R L']","['Cotter FE', 'Auer RL']","['Centre for Haematology, Institute of Cell and Molecular Sciences, Barts and the London Queen Mary School of Medicine, London, UK. f.e.cotter@qmul.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Switzerland,Cytogenet Genome Res,Cytogenetic and genome research,101142708,,IM,"['*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Disease Progression', 'Gene Silencing', 'Haplotypes', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Mutation']",2007/11/15 09:00,2007/12/06 09:00,['2007/11/15 09:00'],"['2007/03/03 00:00 [received]', '2007/03/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/11/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['000108315 [pii]', '10.1159/000108315 [doi]']",ppublish,Cytogenet Genome Res. 2007;118(2-4):310-9. doi: 10.1159/000108315.,,,,,,,,146,,"['Copyright (c) 2007 S.

Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) performed on chromosomes was the first approach taken and nearly 300 cases studied by this technique have already been reported. Array based CGH has also been applied to a smaller number of cases. Both types of genomic studies have confirmed that recurrent genomic losses and gains can almost exclusively be found in cases with complex karyotype. In most cases with normal karyotype (as well as in others with single chromosome aberrations as trisomy 8), arrayCGH has been able to unveil small DNA copy number changes whose recurrence is very low.

Recently, evidence has been accumulating on the molecular mechanism underlying self-renewal of stem cells. Specifically, we have been focusing on Polycomb-group (PcG) genes, which play an important role in supporting self-renewal. There is emerging evidence indicating that the PcG complexes are indispensable for sustaining stem cell activity and cancer stem cells. We have reported that the expression of BMI1, a member of PcG, in hematopoietic stem cells or progenitor cells predicts the prognosis of patients with MDS and progression to acute leukemia. And recent genome-wide analyses showed that major transcriptional regulators governing development are under the regulation of PcG complexes. Thus PcG not only provides a molecular marker for monitoring disease progression of MDS, but also provides a clue for elucidating a molecular mechanism underlying the disease progression, which may help in the development of a new therapeutic strategy against MDS.

An example is bcr-abl tyrosine kinase in chronic myelogenous leukemia that can be treated with imatinib mesylate. However, the mechanisms of translocations or exchanges of chromosomal segments are virtually unknown. In this summary, chromosomal translocations in human cancer are compared with 'crossing over' of chromosomal segments occurring during the first meiotic division. Several proposed mechanisms of the exchange of DNA between and among chromosomes are discussed. The conditions that appear essential for these events to occur are listed. Among them are proximity of the involved DNA segments, mechanisms of excising the target DNA, its transport to the new location, and integration into the pre-existing chromosome. The conclusion based on extensive review of the literature is that practically nothing is known about the mechanism of 'crossing over' or translocation. Based on prior work on normal human cells, it is suggested that only one of the two autosomes participates in these events that may include loss of heterozygozity, another common abnormality in human cancer.","['Koss, L G']",['Koss LG'],"['Department of Pathology, Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, NY, USA. lkoss@montefiore.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Switzerland,Cytogenet Genome Res,Cytogenetic and genome research,101142708,,IM,"['Crossing Over, Genetic', 'Humans', 'Loss of Heterozygosity', 'Meiosis/genetics', 'Neoplasms/*genetics', '*Translocation, Genetic']",2007/11/15 09:00,2007/12/06 09:00,['2007/11/15 09:00'],"['2007/01/08 00:00 [received]', '2007/03/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/11/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['000108307 [pii]', '10.1159/000108307 [doi]']",ppublish,Cytogenet Genome Res. 2007;118(2-4):247-51. doi: 10.1159/000108307.,,,,,,,,46,,"['Copyright (c) 2007 S.

Mouse LECT2 protein and mRNA were detected in most hepatocytes in normal mouse; however, at 30 min after PHx, they were not detected in liver tissue. At 2 h after PHx, expression of mLECT2 protein was seen in hepatocytes surrounding the central vein, although mRNA expression levels were still low. At 6 h after PHx, a marked number of hepatocytes expressing mLECT2 protein and mRNA were seen throughout the liver, and at 12 h after PHx, hepatocytes expressing mLECT2 protein and mRNA further increased in number. However, expression levels of mLECT2 protein and mRNA at 24 h after PHx were significantly lower when compared with levels after 12 h.

We show that CRABPI (encoding cellular retinoic acid binding protein I) is a target of PLZF, which is fused to RARalpha by the t(11;17)(q23;q21) translocation associated with retinoic acid (RA)-resistant acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). PLZF represses the CRABPI locus through propagation of chromatin condensation from a remote intronic binding element culminating in silencing of the promoter. Although the canonical, PLZF-RARalpha oncoprotein has no impact on PLZF-mediated repression, the reciprocal translocation product RARalpha-PLZF binds to this remote binding site, recruiting p300, inducing promoter hypomethylation and CRABPI gene up-regulation. In line with these observations, RA-resistant murine PLZF/RARalpha+RARalpha/PLZF APL blasts express much higher levels of CRABPI than standard RA-sensitive PML/RARalpha APL. RARalpha-PLZF confers RA resistance to a retinoid-sensitive acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell line in a CRABPI-dependent fashion. This study supports an active role for PLZF and RARalpha-PLZF in leukemogenesis, identifies up-regulation of CRABPI as a mechanism contributing to retinoid resistance, and reveals the ability of the reciprocal fusion gene products to mediate distinct epigenetic effects contributing to the leukemic phenotype.","['Guidez, Fabien', 'Parks, Sarah', 'Wong, Henna', 'Jovanovic, Jelena V', 'Mays, Ashley', 'Gilkes, Amanda F', 'Mills, Kenneth I', 'Guillemin, Marie-Claude', 'Hobbs, Robin M', 'Pandolfi, Pier Paolo', 'de The, Hugues', 'Solomon, Ellen', 'Grimwade, David']","['Guidez F', 'Parks S', 'Wong H', 'Jovanovic JV', 'Mays A', 'Gilkes AF', 'Mills KI', 'Guillemin MC', 'Hobbs RM', 'Pandolfi PP', 'de The H', 'Solomon E', 'Grimwade D']","[""Department of Medical and Molecular Genetics, King's College London, Guy's Hospital, London SE1 9RT, United Kingdom.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071113,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '0 (Retinoids)', '0 (retinoic acid binding protein I, cellular)', '147855-37-6 (ZBTB16 protein, human)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatin/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17/*genetics', 'DNA Methylation', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/genetics/*metabolism', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'Retinoids/pharmacology', 'Up-Regulation']",2007/11/15 09:00,2008/01/03 09:00,['2007/11/15 09:00'],"['2007/11/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/03 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['0704433104 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.0704433104 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2007 Nov 20;104(47):18694-9. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0704433104.

We have identified a human mitochondrial UMP-CMP kinase (UMP-CMPK, cytidylate kinase; EC 2.7.4.14), designated as UMP-CMP kinase 2 (UMP-CMPK2). The C-terminal domain of this 449-amino acid protein contains all consensus motifs of a nucleoside monophosphate kinase. Phylogenetic analysis showed that UMP-CMPK2 belonged to a novel nucleoside monophosphate kinase family, which was closer to thymidylate kinase than to cytosolic UMP-CMP kinase. Subcellular localization with green fluorescent protein fusion proteins illustrated that UMP-CMPK2 was localized in the mitochondria of HeLa cells and that the mitochondrial targeting signal was included in the N-terminal 22 amino acids. The enzyme was able to phosphorylate dUMP, dCMP, CMP, and UMP with ATP as phosphate donor, but the kinetic properties were different compared with the cytosolic UMP-CMPK. Its efficacy to convert dUMP was highest, followed by dCMP, whereas CMP and UMP were the poorest substrates. It also phosphorylated the monophosphate forms of the nucleoside analogs ddC, dFdC, araC, BVDU, and FdUrd, which suggests that UMP-CMPK2 may be involved in mtDNA depletion caused by long term treatment with ddC or other pyrimidine analogs. UMP-CMPK2 mRNA expression was exclusively detected in chronic myelogenous leukemia K-562 and lymphoblastic leukemia MOLT-4 among eight studied cancer cell lines. Particular high expression in leukemia cells, dominant expression in bone marrow, and tight correlation with macrophage activation and inflammatory response suggest that UMP-CMPK2 may have other functions in addition to the supply of substrates for mtDNA synthesis.","['Xu, Yunjian', 'Johansson, Magnus', 'Karlsson, Anna']","['Xu Y', 'Johansson M', 'Karlsson A']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm 14186, Sweden.

Based on their recent experience in indolent non-Hodgkin lymphomas, in this study, the authors attempted to demonstrate whether consolidation/maintenance therapy with rituximab could prolong the response duration in this patient population. METHODS: This Phase II study was based on a consolidation/maintenance therapy with rituximab for patients in complete remission (CR) or partial remission (PR) who were positive for minimal residual disease (MRD), as determined by flow cytometry. Seventy-five symptomatic, untreated patients with B-CLL received 6 monthly cycles of Flu (25 mg/m(2) for 5 days) followed by 4 weekly doses of rituximab (375 mg/m(2)). Then, 28 patients who were positive for MRD were consolidated with 4 monthly cycles of rituximab (375 mg/m(2)) followed by 12 monthly low doses of rituximab (150 mg/m(2)). RESULTS: Based on National Cancer Institute criteria, 61 of 75 patients (81%) achieved a CR, 10 of 75 patients (13%) had a PR, and 4 of 75 patients (5%) had either no response or disease progression. MRD-positive patients in CR or PR who received consolidation therapy (n = 28 patients) had a significantly longer response duration (87% vs 32% at 5 years; P = .001) compared with a subset of patients who did not receive consolidation therapy (n = 18 patients). All patients experienced a long progression-free survival from the end of induction treatment (73% at 5 years). It was noteworthy that, within the subset of ZAP-70-positive patients, MRD-positive, consolidated patients (n = 12 patients) had a significantly longer response duration (69% vs 0% at 2.6 years; P = .007) compared with MRD-positive, unconsolidated patients (n = 11 patients).

Therefore, they can be functionally active when residing at places other than the membrane or extracellular matrix. In fact, nuclear presence of galectins-1 and -3 is solidly documented but it is an open question whether these two cases are exceptional within this lectin family. Thus, galectin-2, which shares 43% sequence identity on the protein level with galectin-1, warrants study in this respect. Based on initial immunohistochemical evidence we herein address the issue as to whether this galectin can join the category of nuclear lectins. To do so we studied different types of cell in vitro using an antibody preparation free of cross-reactivity against other tested galectins. The immunocytochemical experiments revealed that galectin-2 was present in nuclei of murine 3T3 fibroblasts and also genetically engineered human colon carcinoma cells with stable ectopic expression. Transport of galectin-2 to the nucleus could be enhanced by physical (UV light), chemical (mitomycin C, serum withdrawal) or cell biological (coculture with stromal cells) treatment modalities. As a means of further characterizing the staining profile cytochemically, a series of markers with well-defined site of residency within the nuclear compartment was tested in parallel. Importantly, no colocalization with galectins-1 and -3 and the splicing factor SC35 was detectable, the former cases also serving as inherent specificity control. In contrast, a similarity was uncovered in the case of the promyelocytic leukemia (PML) protein as marker of PML nuclear bodies. In aggregate, nuclear localization is documented for galectin-2. This attribute should thus not be considered as an exceptional finding confined to galectins-1 and -3. That even closely related family members, here galectins-1 and -2, exhibit distinct intranuclear localization patterns gives ensuing research a clear direction.","['Dvorankova, B', 'Lacina, L', 'Smetana, K Jr', 'Lensch, M', 'Manning, J C', 'Andre, S', 'Gabius, H-J']","['Dvorankova B', 'Lacina L', 'Smetana K Jr', 'Lensch M', 'Manning JC', 'Andre S', 'Gabius HJ']","['Charles University, 1st Faculty of Medicine, Institute of Anatomy, Prague, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Spain,Histol Histopathol,Histology and histopathology,8609357,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Culture Media, Serum-Free)', '0 (Galectin 2)', '50SG953SK6 (Mitomycin)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Adenocarcinoma/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Biological Transport', 'Biomarkers/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Colonic Neoplasms/*metabolism', 'Culture Media, Serum-Free', 'Galectin 2/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Mice', 'Mitomycin/pharmacology', 'Ultraviolet Rays']",2007/11/14 09:00,2008/01/09 09:00,['2007/11/14 09:00'],"['2007/11/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/09 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/14 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.14670/HH-23.167 [doi]'],ppublish,Histol Histopathol. 2008 Feb;23(2):167-78. doi: 10.14670/HH-23.167.,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.14670/HH-23.167 [doi],,,,,,,,,

Further confirmation of complex translocation was done by FISH study using bcr/abl and whole chromosome 9 probes.

To determine the factors affecting reconstitution of naive T-cells after non-myeloablative HSCT (NM-HSCT), the T-cell receptor excision circle (TREC) content was measured on a weekly basis in 24 transplanted patients with various malignant diseases. We analysed correlations of the results with the development of GvHD. In addition, in 11 chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) patients, we correlated TREC and BCR-ABL transcript numbers. After HSCT, in most patients (22/24) TRECs became undetectable. In 12 patients, TRECs reappeared 3-4 months after HSCT, in 1 patient TRECs reappeared 5 months after HSCT, and in 11 patients TRECs remained negative for more than a year. All 11 patients who remained TREC-negative, developed acute GvHD grade 2-3, while only 6 out of 13 patients who recovered TRECs developed GvHD. We show that after non-myeloablative HSCT, thymopoiesis takes place and is affected by GvHD. Our results indicate that no recovery of TRECs after NM-HSCT (which most likely reflect the expansion of host-reactive co-transplanted mature T-cells) correlates with the onset of GvHD.","['Przybylski, Grzegorz K', 'Kreuzer, Karl-A', 'Siegert, Wolfgang', 'Schmidt, Christian A']","['Przybylski GK', 'Kreuzer KA', 'Siegert W', 'Schmidt CA']","['Institute of Human Genetics, Polish Academy of Sciences, Strzeszynska 32, Poznan, Poland. przybylg@man.poznan.pl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,J Appl Genet,Journal of applied genetics,9514582,"['0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",IM,"['Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*etiology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/complications/*therapy', '*Plasmids', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*genetics']",2007/11/14 09:00,2008/01/29 09:00,['2007/11/14 09:00'],"['2007/11/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/29 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['420 [pii]', '10.1007/BF03195239 [doi]']",ppublish,J Appl Genet. 2007;48(4):397-404. doi: 10.1007/BF03195239.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The human Setd1A histone H3-Lys4 methyltransferase complex was found to physically associate with the RNA polymerase II large subunit. The Wdr82 component of the Setd1A complex interacts with the RNA recognition motif of Setd1A and additionally binds to the Ser5-phosphorylated C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II, which is involved in initiation of transcription, but does not bind to an unphosphorylated or Ser2-phosphorylated C-terminal domain. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that Setd1A is localized near the transcription start site of expressed genes. Small interfering RNA-mediated depletion of Wdr82 leads to decreased Setd1A expression and occupancy at transcription start sites and reduced histone H3-Lys4 trimethylation at these sites. However, neither RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) occupancy nor target gene expression levels are altered following Wdr82 depletion. Hence, Wdr82 is required for the targeting of Setd1A-mediated histone H3-Lys4 trimethylation near transcription start sites via tethering to RNA polymerase II, an event that is a consequence of transcription initiation. These results suggest a model for how the mammalian RNAP II machinery is linked with histone H3-Lys4 histone methyltransferase complexes at transcriptionally active genes.","['Lee, Jeong-Heon', 'Skalnik, David G']","['Lee JH', 'Skalnik DG']","['Cancer Research Institute, Room 327, 1044 W.

It inhibited topoisomerase II activity and stabilized topoisomerase II-DNA cleavable complexes. The DNA breaks occurred within 1h after treatment with NK314 even without digestion of topoisomerase II by proteinase K, whereas etoposide required digestion of the enzyme protein in cleavable complex to detect DNA breaks. Pretreatment with topoisomerase II catalytic inhibitors, ICRF-193 and suramin, reduced both cleavable complex-mediated DNA breaks and proteinase K-independent DNA breaks, but protease inhibitors and nuclease inhibitors only decreased the latter. These results indicate that NK314 might affect topoisomerase II in the different manner from cleavable complex formation and activate intracellular proteinase and nuclease to produce DNA fragmentation. As a result of this unique mechanism of DNA breakage, NK314 showed substantial growth inhibition of topoisomerase II inhibitor-resistant tumors.","['Onda, Takeshi', 'Toyoda, Eriko', 'Miyazaki, Osamu', 'Seno, Chieko', 'Kagaya, Shigehide', 'Okamoto, Kazuya', 'Nishikawa, Kiyohiro']","['Onda T', 'Toyoda E', 'Miyazaki O', 'Seno C', 'Kagaya S', 'Okamoto K', 'Nishikawa K']","['Pharmaceutical Research Laboratories, Nippon Kayaku Co., Ltd., Kita-ku, Tokyo 115-8588, Japan. takeshi.onda@nipponkayaku.co.jp <takeshi.onda@nipponkayaku.co.jp>']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20071112,Ireland,Cancer Lett,Cancer letters,7600053,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (NK314)', '0 (Phenanthrenes)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', 'EC 3.4.21.64 (Endopeptidase K)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', '*DNA Breaks, Double-Stranded', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Endopeptidase K/metabolism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia P388', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/enzymology/genetics', 'Phenanthrenes/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Time Factors', '*Topoisomerase II Inhibitors', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2007/11/14 09:00,2008/03/14 09:00,['2007/11/14 09:00'],"['2007/06/18 00:00 [received]', '2007/09/21 00:00 [revised]', '2007/10/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/11/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/14 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0304-3835(07)00471-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.canlet.2007.10.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Lett. 2008 Jan 18;259(1):99-110. doi: 10.1016/j.canlet.2007.10.004.

However, it is unclear and unknown whether quercetin influences cell maturation. We examined the effect of quercetin on the growth and differentiation of human preadipocyte cells AML-I. Induced growth arrest of AML-I by quercetin was accompanied by the appearance of characteristics of apoptosis under the adipogenic stimulation by annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate staining method. A decrease of nuclear factor-kappaB and the antiapoptotic protein Mcl-1 and an increase of the proapoptotic protein Bad were observed in time-dependent fashion in the quercetin-treated cells compared with the vehicle-treated cells by Western blot analysis. Structure-related flavonoids, including rutin (quercetin-3-O-rutinoside) and quercitrin (quercetin-3-O-rhamnoside), did not have any cytotoxic effect on AML-I. Interestingly, exposure of AML-I to quercetin for 6 days increased the amount of cytoplasmic lipid droplets as well as the expression of fatty acid synthase and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma proteins. These results suggested that apoptosis induced by quercetin was not linked to adipogenic conversion of preadipocytes.","['Morikawa, Keiko', 'Ikeda, Chiharu', 'Nonaka, Mitsuko', 'Suzuki, Ikue']","['Morikawa K', 'Ikeda C', 'Nonaka M', 'Suzuki I']","[""Department of Nutrition, Division of Clinical Nutrition, Sagami Women's University, Sagamihara, Kanagawa, Japan. morikawa_keiko@isc.sagami-wu.ac.jp""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Metabolism,Metabolism: clinical and experimental,0375267,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (FAS protein, human)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (PPAR gamma)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-Associated Death Protein)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '9IKM0I5T1E (Quercetin)']",IM,"['Adipocytes/cytology/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Antioxidants/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Growth Processes/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Fluorescent Dyes/chemistry', 'Glycosylation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Lipid Metabolism/drug effects', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'NF-kappa B/biosynthesis', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis', 'PPAR gamma/biosynthesis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis', 'Quercetin/*pharmacology', 'bcl-Associated Death Protein/biosynthesis', 'fas Receptor/biosynthesis']",2007/11/14 09:00,2008/01/09 09:00,['2007/11/14 09:00'],"['2006/07/11 00:00 [received]', '2007/07/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/11/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/09 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0026-0495(07)00270-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.metabol.2007.07.008 [doi]']",ppublish,Metabolism. 2007 Dec;56(12):1656-65. doi: 10.1016/j.metabol.2007.07.008.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The inhibition rate of K562/A02 cell proliferation was detected by using methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium assay (MTT); the level of VEGF was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and the expression rate of P-gp was determined by flow cytometry (FCM). RESULTS: 0.05 micromol/L ATO had no influences on the cell proliferation and the expression of VEGF in K562/A02 cells; 0.4 and 3.2 micromol/L ATO could significantly inhibit the K562/A02 cell proliferation and down-regulate the expression of VEGF in K562/A02 cells (P<0.05). The expression of P-gp did not changed after being exposed to 0.05 and 0.4 micromol/L ATO for 24, 48 and 72 hours (P>0.05). 3.2 micromol/L ATO could remarkably reduce the expression of P-gp in K562/A02 cells after 48- and 72-hour incubation with ATO (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The down-regulation of P-gp and VEGF after being exposed to ATO probably contributes to the reversion of multidrug resistance in K562/A02 cells. The level of VEGF may be related to the expression rate of P-gp in K562/A02 cells.","['Liang, Hong', 'Zhang, Yu', 'Zhang, Jian-dong', 'Gu, Jian', 'Ma, Li', 'Wang, Xiao-ling', 'Shen, Wei-gan']","['Liang H', 'Zhang Y', 'Zhang JD', 'Gu J', 'Ma L', 'Wang XL', 'Shen WG']","['Medical College, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou, Jiangsu Province 225001, China.']",['chi'],['Journal Article'],,China,Zhong Xi Yi Jie He Xue Bao,Zhong xi yi jie he xue bao = Journal of Chinese integrative medicine,101199657,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Doxorubicin', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/*drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/*metabolism']",2007/11/14 09:00,2009/12/30 06:00,['2007/11/14 09:00'],"['2007/11/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/30 06:00 [medline]', '2007/11/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['167219772007060647 [pii]', '10.3736/jcim20070609 [doi]']",ppublish,Zhong Xi Yi Jie He Xue Bao. 2007 Nov;5(6):647-50. doi: 10.3736/jcim20070609.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Anonymised samples and accompanying study subject information were obtained from the Edinburgh respiratory specimen archive. Samples were screened by nested PCR using two sets of primers conserved between WUV and KIPyV, as well for other respiratory viruses (respiratory syncytial virus [RSV], adenoviruses [AdV], influenza A/B and parainfluenza viruses 1-3, human bocavirus, B19). RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: WUV and KIPyV were detected in 10 and 14 samples, respectively from 983 specimens (from 9 to 10 different individuals from 612 study subjects). Infections occurred in two types of study subject; those who were young (<2 years) with lower respiratory tract infections (n=8), and almost invariably co-infected with other respiratory viruses (RSV, AdV), and a second, generally older group either without respiratory disease (n=6) or with mild upper respiratory tract infections (n=5) but who were generally clinically severely immunosuppressed from leukaemia or transplant therapy.

Werner syndrome, resulting from WRN mutation, is a segmental progeria. Endogenous WRN and BLM proteins localize in nucleoli and in nuclear PML bodies defined by isoforms of the PML protein, which is a key regulator of cellular senescence. We further characterized WRN and BLM localization using labeling with monomeric red fluorescence protein (mRFP). When ectopically expressed, mRFP-WRN (or untagged WRN) forms nuclear bodies, which are donut-shaped in some cells. We identified PML isoforms associating with the nuclear bodies. Interestingly, mRFP-WRN relocalizes from nucleoli to the nucleoplasm, frequently showing conspicuous nucleolar exclusion as well as a decrease in frequency of mRFP-WRN nuclear bodies in response to overexpression of wild-type and deacetylase mutant (H363Y) SIRT1 proteins. Similar nucleolar relocalization in response to wild-type SIRT1 was detected for mRFP-labeled BLM. Moreover, increased SIRT1 expression was associated with the downregulation of endogenous WRN and a decreased frequency of cells with BRCA1 foci. Our data indicate for the first time that SIRT1 protein may be functionally associated with WRN and BLM helicases and that some major SIRT1 functions may not require its deacetylase activity.","['Vaitiekunaite, Rasa', 'Butkiewicz, Dorota', 'Krzesniak, Malgorzata', 'Przybylek, Malgorzata', 'Gryc, Agata', 'Snietura, Miroslaw', 'Benedyk, Malgorzata', 'Harris, Curtis C', 'Rusin, Marek']","['Vaitiekunaite R', 'Butkiewicz D', 'Krzesniak M', 'Przybylek M', 'Gryc A', 'Snietura M', 'Benedyk M', 'Harris CC', 'Rusin M']","['Department of Tumor Biology, Maria Sklodowska - Curie Memorial Cancer Center, ul.

OBJECTIVES: This review focuses on monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) that are used in the treatment of hematologic malignancies. Our goal was to provide the reader with information on trials that led to US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of commonly used MAbs in hematologic malignancies, including their mechanisms of action and pharmacokinetics, with specific emphasis on use in elderly patients; we also present data on toxicities and precautions to be aware of when administering these drugs. METHODS: Materials for this review were gathered based on a computerized literature search (English-language articles only) using the PubMed database covering the period January 1998 to December 2005. Search terms used included the following: elderly, monoclonal antibodies, and neoplasms. RESULTS: Alemtuzumab is a recombinant DNA-derived, humanized MAb directed against the CD52 B-cell antigen. It is indicated for the treatment of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) in patients who have been treated with alkylating agents and who have failed to respond to fludarabine therapy. Gemtuzumab ozogamicin is an MAb conjugated with a cytotoxic antitumor antibiotic, calicheamicin. It has been approved for use in patients with CD33-positive acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in first relapse who are aged > or =60 years and who are not considered candidates for other cytotoxic chemotherapy. Rituximab, one of the first MAbs approved by the FDA for use in human cancers, is an antibody directed against the CD20 antigen found on the surface of normal and malignant B lymphocytes. It is extensively used in the treatment of B-cell malignancies, such as CLL, and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHLs), such as follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. CONCLUSIONS: It is noteworthy that while there have been a number of studies using these agents in the younger population, there continues to be a paucity of clinical trials targeting the elderly patient in particular; this continues to be an area of research interest. More clinical studies of these agents--conducted specifically in elderly patients with CLL, NHL, AML, and other hematologic malignancies--are needed.","['Rao, Arati V', 'Schmader, Kenneth']","['Rao AV', 'Schmader K']","['Division of Medical Oncology and Cell Therapy, Division of Geriatrics, Duke University Medical Center, Durham Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina 27710, USA. rao00012@mc.duke.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Am J Geriatr Pharmacother,The American journal of geriatric pharmacotherapy,101190325,"['0 (Aminoglycosides)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '3A189DH42V (Alemtuzumab)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', '93NS566KF7 (Gemtuzumab)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Alemtuzumab', 'Aminoglycosides/administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics', 'Controlled Clinical Trials as Topic', '*Drug Delivery Systems', 'Gemtuzumab', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Rituximab']",2007/11/13 09:00,2008/01/23 09:00,['2007/11/13 09:00'],"['2007/03/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/11/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/23 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1543-5946(07)00043-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.amjopharm.2007.09.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Geriatr Pharmacother. 2007 Sep;5(3):247-62. doi: 10.1016/j.amjopharm.2007.09.002.,,,,,,,,62,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As a consequence, prognostic factors in AML are more useful for the prediction of relapse, rather than for the stratification of induction therapy. Most relevant studies, based on large multicenter trials have definitively demonstrated that age and cytogenetics at diagnosis are the most important prognostic determinants for patients with AML. Early blast clearance after induction chemotherapy represents a further important factor of potential utility into clinical practice.

Molecular approaches including cDNA library screening and genetic linkage analysis have been successfully applied to identify T cell-defined mHAgs, but each approach has its drawbacks which may lead to mis-identification of the mHAg of interest. We improved both molecular strategies to facilitate more robust identification of hematopoietic-restricted mHAgs. First, we adapted cDNA library cloning by using 293T cells with stable expression of the relevant MHC class I allele, CD80 and CD54. We demonstrated that cDNA library screening using this 293T expression system results in strong activation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes, which significantly contributes to improvement of the assay sensitivity. Second, we refined genetic linkage analysis using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping to narrow down the defined genetic region that holds the mHAg-encoding gene. We showed that SNP marker analysis provides additional information about the genetic position of the antigen-encoding gene.

Polysaccharide extracts from Ganoderma lucidum have been reported to exhibit immuno-modulating and anti-tumor activities. In previous studies, F3, the active component of the polysaccharide extract, was found to activate various cytokines such as IL-1, IL-6, IL-12, and TNF-alpha. This gave rise to our investigation on how F3 stimulates immuno-modulating or anti-tumor effects in human leukemia THP-1 cells. RESULTS: Here, we integrated time-course DNA microarray analysis, quantitative PCR assays, and bioinformatics methods to study the F3-induced effects in THP-1 cells. Significantly disturbed pathways induced by F3 were identified with statistical analysis on microarray data. The apoptosis induction through the DR3 and DR4/5 death receptors was found to be one of the most significant pathways and play a key role in THP-1 cells after F3 treatment. Based on time-course gene expression measurements of the identified pathway, we reconstructed a plausible regulatory network of the involved genes using reverse-engineering computational approach. CONCLUSION: Our results showed that F3 may induce death receptor ligands to initiate signaling via receptor oligomerization, recruitment of specialized adaptor proteins and activation of caspase cascades.","['Cheng, Kun-Chieh', 'Huang, Hsuan-Cheng', 'Chen, Jenn-Han', 'Hsu, Jia-Wei', 'Cheng, Hsu-Chieh', 'Ou, Chern-Han', 'Yang, Wen-Bin', 'Chen, Shui-Tein', 'Wong, Chi-Huey', 'Juan, Hsueh-Fen']","['Cheng KC', 'Huang HC', 'Chen JH', 'Hsu JW', 'Cheng HC', 'Ou CH', 'Yang WB', 'Chen ST', 'Wong CH', 'Juan HF']","['Department of Life Science, National Taiwan University, Taipei 106, Taiwan. jerekcheng@gmail.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20071109,England,BMC Genomics,BMC genomics,100965258,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Drugs, Chinese Herbal)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Polysaccharides)', '0 (Receptors, Death Domain)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects/genetics/physiology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytokines/genetics/metabolism', 'Drugs, Chinese Herbal/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Plant Extracts/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Polysaccharides/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Receptors, Death Domain/genetics/metabolism', 'Reishi/*chemistry', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/genetics/physiology']",2007/11/13 09:00,2008/02/05 09:00,['2007/11/13 09:00'],"['2007/07/26 00:00 [received]', '2007/11/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/11/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/05 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['1471-2164-8-411 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2164-8-411 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Genomics. 2007 Nov 9;8:411. doi: 10.1186/1471-2164-8-411.,,,,,PMC2211495,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We focused our attention on some members of the PBTDs family to test their potential apoptotic activity in K562 cells. Important apoptotic activity was demonstrated, as evidenced by the concentration and percentage of cell death quantified by measuring PI-uptake by flow cytometry, and DNA fragmentation analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis, generating a characteristic ladder pattern of discontinuous DNA fragments. The expression of Bcl-2 family was tested using western blotting and transfection method. RESULTS: PBTDs-mediated suppression of K562 cell proliferation was induced by apoptosis characterized by the appearance of DNA fragmentation and was associated with the poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (PARP) cleavage. PBTD-1 and -3 treatment resulted in caspase-3 activation through down-regulation of Bcl-2 and up-regulation of Bax. Furthermore, we used K562/vector and K562/bcl-2 cells, which were generated by transfection of the cDNA of the Bcl-2 gene. As compared with K562/vector, K562/Bcl-2 cells exhibited a 4-fold greater expression of Bcl-2. Treatment with 10 muM PBTD-1 and -3 for 24 h produced morphological features of apoptosis and DNA fragmentation in K562/vector cells, respectively. In contrast, PBTD-1 and -3-induced caspase-3 activation and apoptosis were inhibited in K562/Bcl-2. Furthermore, Bcl-2 overexpressing cells exhibited less cytocrome c release during PBTDs-induced apoptosis. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that PBTDs effectively induce apoptosis of K562 leukemia cells through the activation of caspase cascades. In addition, these findings indicate that Bcl-2 inhibits PBTD-1 and -3 induced-apoptosis via a mechanism that interferes with cytocrome c release, and the activity of caspase-3, which is involved in the execution of apoptosis.","['Marfe, Gabriella', 'Di Stefano, Carla', 'Silvestri, Romano', 'Abruzzese, Elisabetta', 'Catalano, Gianfranco', 'Di Renzo, Livia', 'Filomeni, Giuseppe', 'Giorda, Ezio', 'La Regina, Giuseppe', 'Morgante, Emanuela', 'Ciriolo, Maria Rosa', 'Russo, Matteo Antonio', 'Amadori, Sergio', 'Sinibaldi-Salimei, Paola']","['Marfe G', 'Di Stefano C', 'Silvestri R', 'Abruzzese E', 'Catalano G', 'Di Renzo L', 'Filomeni G', 'Giorda E', 'La Regina G', 'Morgante E', 'Ciriolo MR', 'Russo MA', 'Amadori S', 'Sinibaldi-Salimei P']","['Department of Experimental Medicine and Biochemical Sciences, University of Rome Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy. gmarfe1@virgilio.it']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20071109,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,"['0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (Cyclic S-Oxides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RS 678)', '0 (RS 779)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '12794-10-4 (Benzodiazepines)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Benzodiazepines/*pharmacology', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cyclic S-Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Cytochromes c/drug effects/metabolism', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Down-Regulation', 'Genes, bcl-2/physiology', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Mitochondria/metabolism', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism']",2007/11/13 09:00,2008/03/25 09:00,['2007/11/13 09:00'],"['2007/07/06 00:00 [received]', '2007/11/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/11/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/25 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['1471-2407-7-207 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2407-7-207 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2007 Nov 9;7:207. doi: 10.1186/1471-2407-7-207.,,,,,PMC2222638,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For the formation of a normal sized Leydig cell population in the adult testis, the presence of LH appears to be essential. Oncostatin M (OSM) is a multifunctional cytokine and member of the interleukin (IL)-6 family that also includes other cytokines such as LIF. In the rat OSM is highly expressed in the late fetal and neonatal testis, and may thus be a candidate factor involved in Leydig cell progenitor formation. METHODS: Interstitial cells were isolated from 13-day-old rat testes and cultured for 1, 3 or 8 days in the presence of different doses of OSM (range: 0.01 to 10 ng/ml) alone or in combination with LH (1 ng/ml). The effects of OSM and LH on cell proliferation were determined by incubating the cultures with [3H]thymidine or bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU). Developing progenitor cells were identified histochemically by the presence of the marker enzyme 3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3beta-HSD). RESULTS: OSM, when added at a dose of 10 ng/ml, caused a nearly 2-fold increase in the percentage of Leydig cell progenitors after 8 days of culture. Immunohistochemical double labelling experiments with 3beta-HSD and BrdU antibodies showed that this increase was the result of differentiation of stem Leydig cells/precursor cells and not caused by proliferation of progenitor cells themselves. The addition of LH to the cultures consistently resulted in an increase in progenitor formation throughout the culture period. Surprisingly, when OSM and LH were added together, the LH induced rise in progenitor cells was significantly inhibited after 3 and 8 days of culture. CONCLUSION: Taken together, the results of the present study suggest that locally produced OSM may not only play a role in the regulation of Sertoli cell proliferation and the initiation of spermatogenesis but may also play a role in the regulation of Leydig cell progenitor formation by keeping the augmenting effects of LH on this process in abeyance.","['Teerds, Katja J', 'van Dissel-Emiliani, Federica M F', 'De Miguel, Maria P', 'de Boer-Brouwer, Mieke', 'Korting, Lina M', 'Rijntjes, Eddy']","['Teerds KJ', 'van Dissel-Emiliani FM', 'De Miguel MP', 'de Boer-Brouwer M', 'Korting LM', 'Rijntjes E']","['Department of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Utrecht University, Utrecht, the Netherlands. katja.teerds@wur.nl']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20071108,England,Reprod Biol Endocrinol,Reproductive biology and endocrinology : RB&E,101153627,"['0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', '106956-32-5 (Oncostatin M)', '9002-67-9 (Luteinizing Hormone)', 'EC 1.1.- (3-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases)', 'EC 1.1.1.51 (3 beta-hydroxy-delta 5-steroid dehydrogenase, rat)']",IM,"['3-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Leydig Cells/*drug effects/metabolism/physiology', 'Luteinizing Hormone/*antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Male', 'Oncostatin M/*pharmacology/physiology', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF/metabolism', 'Spermatogenesis/drug effects', 'Stem Cells/*drug effects/metabolism/physiology']",2007/11/13 09:00,2008/02/08 09:00,['2007/11/13 09:00'],"['2007/07/17 00:00 [received]', '2007/11/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/11/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/08 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['1477-7827-5-43 [pii]', '10.1186/1477-7827-5-43 [doi]']",epublish,Reprod Biol Endocrinol. 2007 Nov 8;5:43. doi: 10.1186/1477-7827-5-43.,,,,,PMC2174940,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In combination with rituximab, we have previously demonstrated that IMiDs have synergistic in vivo anti-tumour activity in preclinical studies in a human lymphoma severe combined immunodeficiency mouse model. This report further explored the mechanisms by which IMiDs exert their anti-lymphoma effects. Following exposure of subcutaneous lymphoma tumours in murine models to IMiDs, there was a significant increase in the recruitment of natural killer (NK) cells to tumour sites. This increase in NK cells was mediated via stimulation of dendritic cells and modification of the cytokine microenvironment associated with an increase in monocyte chemotactic protein-1, tumour necrosis factor-alpha and interferon-gamma and probably augmented rituximab-associated antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. IMiDs also had significant anti-angiogenic effects in our B-cell lymphoma models. Thus, by modulation of the immune system mediated via dendritic cells and NK cells, changing the cytokine milieu, as well as by their anti-angiogenic effects, IMiDs in combination with rituximab resulted in augmented in vivo anti-tumour effects against B-cell lymphoma. Our positive preclinical data adds additional support for the evaluation of IMiDs plus rituximab in patients with relapsed/refractory B-cell lymphoma.","['Reddy, Nishitha', 'Hernandez-Ilizaliturri, Francisco J', 'Deeb, George', 'Roth, Mark', 'Vaughn, Mary', 'Knight, Joy', 'Wallace, Paul', 'Czuczman, Myron S']","['Reddy N', 'Hernandez-Ilizaliturri FJ', 'Deeb G', 'Roth M', 'Vaughn M', 'Knight J', 'Wallace P', 'Czuczman MS']","['Department of Medicine, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, NY 14263, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20071109,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Angiogenesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', '4Z8R6ORS6L (Thalidomide)', 'D2UX06XLB5 (pomalidomide)', 'F0P408N6V4 (Lenalidomide)']",IM,"['Angiogenesis Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytokines/biosynthesis', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/*drug effects', 'Dendritic Cells/metabolism', 'Drug Interactions', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*drug effects', 'Lenalidomide', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Microcirculation', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic/prevention & control', 'Rituximab', 'Thalidomide/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology']",2007/11/13 09:00,2008/04/24 09:00,['2007/11/13 09:00'],"['2007/11/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/24 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['BJH6841 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2007.06841.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2008 Jan;140(1):36-45. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2007.06841.x.

OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to describe the MRI appearance of pediatric leukemic relapse. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 53 consecutive children with a history of ALL were referred for musculoskeletal MRI from 1 January 1998 to 28 February 2007 at one center, and from 1 January 2000 to 2 May 2007 at a second center. From this group, 14 children seen at initial diagnosis of leukemia and 2 children who underwent MRI after therapy for relapse were excluded. The remaining 37 children, 8 with relapse and 29 in remission, were studied. Images of patients with relapse and in remission were reviewed for type and configuration of marrow infiltration; coexisting marrow alterations including osteonecrosis or stress reaction were also reviewed. RESULTS: All eight children with relapse demonstrated nodular lesions with well-defined margins. Coexisting osteonecrosis was present in three children (38%) and pathologic fracture in one. Among the 29 children in remission, 9 showed stress reaction/fracture, 14 showed osteonecrosis and 9 showed ill-defined nodules, and in 5 the marrow was completely normal. CONCLUSION: Well-defined nodules in all patients with leukemic relapse suggest that this appearance is characteristic and distinct from the published findings of diffuse marrow replacement in acute leukemia.","['Kan, J Herman', 'Hernanz-Schulman, Marta', 'Frangoul, Haydar A', 'Connolly, Susan A']","['Kan JH', 'Hernanz-Schulman M', 'Frangoul HA', 'Connolly SA']","[""Department of Radiology and Radiological Sciences, Vanderbilt Children's Hospital, Vanderbilt University, 2200 Children's Way, Nashville, TN 37232, USA. herman.kan@vanderbilt.edu""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20071110,Germany,Pediatr Radiol,Pediatric radiology,0365332,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow Diseases/*diagnosis', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging/*methods', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies']",2007/11/13 09:00,2008/06/18 09:00,['2007/11/13 09:00'],"['2007/07/03 00:00 [received]', '2007/09/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/08/17 00:00 [revised]', '2007/11/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/18 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/13 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00247-007-0653-4 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Radiol. 2008 Jan;38(1):76-81. doi: 10.1007/s00247-007-0653-4.

This study retrospectively examines 179 consecutive patients undergoing SCT between 1995 and 2002. Diagnoses included acute and chronic leukemia (n=136), solid tumors (n=11), other malignancies (n=16) and non-malignant diseases (n=16). Standard myeloablative conditioning was given to 146 patients, and 33 patients received reduced intensity conditioning. Serum samples for measurement of IgG levels were collected 3, 6 and 12 months after SCT, and then yearly. IgG levels increased after SCT throughout the study period. Factors that were associated with low IgG levels after SCT were acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), patient age < or =30 years, female donor-to-male recipient, not receiving anti-thymocyte globulin and type of GVHD prophylaxis. Compared to patients with moderately low or normal levels as measured twice during the first year after transplantation, patients with low IgG levels (<4 g/l) showed a decreased survival rate (54 vs 71%, P=0.04) and an increased incidence of transplant-related mortality (27 vs 9%, P<0.01). IgG levels generally increase after SCT.

Analysis of mice carrying conditional AML1 knockout alleles and knock-in mice carrying mutations in all three AML1 sites of the URE proximal region demonstrated that AML1 regulates PU.1 both positively and negatively in a lineage dependent manner.

In addition to the genetic material, the cellular nucleus contains many proteins located at its different compartments, called subnuclear locations. Information of their localization in a nucleus is indispensable for the in-depth study of system biology because, in addition to helping determine their functions, it can provide illuminative insights of how and in what kind of microenvironments these subnuclear proteins are interacting with each other and with other molecules. Facing the deluge of protein sequences generated in the post-genomic age, we are challenged to develop an automated method for fast and effectively annotating the subnuclear locations of numerous newly found nuclear protein sequences. In view of this, a new classifier, called Nuc-PLoc, has been developed that can be used to identify nuclear proteins among the following nine subnuclear locations: (1) chromatin, (2) heterochromatin, (3) nuclear envelope, (4) nuclear matrix, (5) nuclear pore complex, (6) nuclear speckle, (7) nucleolus, (8) nucleoplasm and (9) nuclear promyelocytic leukaemia (PML) body. Nuc-PLoc is featured by an ensemble classifier formed by fusing the evolution information of a protein and its pseudo-amino acid composition. The overall jackknife cross-validation accuracy obtained by Nuc-PLoc is significantly higher than those by the existing methods on the same benchmark data set through the same testing procedure.

Here, we demonstrate polarized expansion of CD8(+) terminal-memory differentiation in such patients, as demonstrated by CD45RA expression and absence of CD62L expression, suggesting repeated stimulation by antigen in vivo. Elimination of antigen-stimulated T cells normally occurs through Fas-mediated apoptosis. We show that cells from LGL leukemia patients express increased levels of c-FLIP and display resistance to Fas-mediated apoptosis and abridged recruitment of proteins that comprise the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC), including the Fas-associated protein with death-domain (FADD) and caspase-8. Exposure to interleukin-2 (IL-2) for only 24 hours sensitized leukemic LGL to Fas-mediated apoptosis with enhanced formation of the DISC, and increased caspase-8 and caspase-3 activities. We observed dysregulation of c-FLIP by IL-2 in leukemic LGL, suggesting a role in Fas resistance. Our results demonstrate that expanded T cells in patients with LGL leukemia display both functional and phenotypic characteristics of prior antigen activation in vivo and display reduced capacity for Fas-mediated DISC formation.","['Yang, Jun', 'Epling-Burnette, P K', 'Painter, Jeffrey S', 'Zou, Jianxiang', 'Bai, Fanqi', 'Wei, Sheng', 'Loughran, Thomas P Jr']","['Yang J', 'Epling-Burnette PK', 'Painter JS', 'Zou J', 'Bai F', 'Wei S', 'Loughran TP Jr']","['Penn State Cancer Institute, Department of Medicine, College of Medicine, Penn State University, Hershey, PA 17033, USA. jyang@psu.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20071109,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (CD8 Antigens)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (fas Receptor)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis/drug effects', 'CD8 Antigens/immunology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Memory/immunology', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Large Granular Lymphocytic/immunology/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Phenotype', 'Protein Binding', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/metabolism', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', '*Signal Transduction', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects', 'fas Receptor/*metabolism']",2007/11/13 09:00,2008/03/28 09:00,['2007/11/13 09:00'],"['2007/11/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/28 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)45419-9 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2007-06-093823 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2008 Feb 1;111(3):1610-6. doi: 10.1182/blood-2007-06-093823.

Murine erythroblastic islands were reconstituted in vitro with macrophages and developmentally synchronous proerythroblasts. Erythroblasts cocultured with macrophages proliferated 3-fold greater than erythroblasts cultured alone. Direct contact with the macrophages was necessary for this enhanced erythroblast proliferation, which resulted from decreased transit time in the G(0)/G(1) phase of cell cycle. Increased erythroblast proliferation in erythroblastic islands occurred over a wide range of erythropoietin concentrations and was the result of a mechanism different from the antiapoptotic effect of erythropoietin. Erythroblasts adherent to macrophages had slightly delayed enucleation, but otherwise differentiation was similar to erythroblasts cultured alone or those that became nonadherent in cocultures. These results suggest a mechanism for the development of anemias associated with abnormal macrophage function and for reduced responsiveness of those anemias to erythropoietin therapy.","['Rhodes, Melissa M', 'Kopsombut, Prapaporn', 'Bondurant, Maurice C', 'Price, James O', 'Koury, Mark J']","['Rhodes MM', 'Kopsombut P', 'Bondurant MC', 'Price JO', 'Koury MJ']","['Department of Pediatrics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071109,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,['11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Erythroblasts/*cytology/*drug effects', 'Erythropoietin/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/physiology', 'Macrophages/*cytology/*drug effects', 'Mice', 'Spleen/cytology']",2007/11/13 09:00,2008/03/28 09:00,['2007/11/13 09:00'],"['2007/11/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/28 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)45429-1 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2007-06-098178 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2008 Feb 1;111(3):1700-8. doi: 10.1182/blood-2007-06-098178.

To circumvent the inhibitory effect of killer immunoglobulin receptor (KIR) signaling, we generated NK-cell lines with single KIR specificities for major human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I allotypes. We demonstrated efficient cytolysis of KIR-HLA class I-mismatched primary AML blasts even at low effector-to-target ratios. To define the impact of tumor-associated activating NKG2D-ligands (NKG2D-L), 66 AML patients at diagnosis were analyzed. NKG2D-L were selectively expressed on monoblastic cells in AML M4 and M5 yet absent or weakly expressed on myeloblastic cells in all AML subtypes. Paucity of cell-surface NKG2D-L was not the result of shedding because levels of soluble ULBP1 ligand measured in AML plasma were in the normal range. Notably, purified NKG2D-L(+) monoblastic cells were more susceptible to NK-mediated killing than NKG2D-L(-) myeloblastic cells. Accordingly, induction of cell-surface NKG2D-L by treatment with the histone deacetylase inhibitor, valproic acid, rendered cells more sensitive to NK cytolysis. These data suggest that adoptive transfer of selected populations of alloreactive HLA class I-mismatched NK cells in combination with pharmacologic induction of NKG2D-L merits clinical evaluation as novel approaches to immunotherapy of human AML.","['Diermayr, Stefan', 'Himmelreich, Heike', 'Durovic, Bojana', 'Mathys-Schneeberger, Arina', 'Siegler, Uwe', 'Langenkamp, Ulrich', 'Hofsteenge, Jan', 'Gratwohl, Alois', 'Tichelli, Andre', 'Paluszewska, Monika', 'Wiktor-Jedrzejczak, Wieslaw', 'Kalberer, Christian P', 'Wodnar-Filipowicz, Aleksandra']","['Diermayr S', 'Himmelreich H', 'Durovic B', 'Mathys-Schneeberger A', 'Siegler U', 'Langenkamp U', 'Hofsteenge J', 'Gratwohl A', 'Tichelli A', 'Paluszewska M', 'Wiktor-Jedrzejczak W', 'Kalberer CP', 'Wodnar-Filipowicz A']","['Department of Research, University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071109,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (GPI-Linked Proteins)', '0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (KLRK1 protein, human)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (MHC class I-related chain A)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily K)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Natural Killer Cell)', '0 (ULBP1 protein, human)', '0 (valpronic acid)', '614OI1Z5WI (Valproic Acid)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Cell Survival', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/immunology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'GPI-Linked Proteins', 'HLA Antigens/*immunology', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/immunology/metabolism', '*Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Histone Deacetylases/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/metabolism', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*drug effects/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/immunology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Ligands', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism', 'NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily K', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Natural Killer Cell', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Solubility', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects', 'Valproic Acid/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology']",2007/11/13 09:00,2008/03/28 09:00,['2007/11/13 09:00'],"['2007/11/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/28 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)45397-2 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2007-07-101311 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2008 Feb 1;111(3):1428-36. doi: 10.1182/blood-2007-07-101311.

The protein product of the T cell leukemia 1 (TCL1) proto-oncogene binds to Akt enhancing its kinase activity. TCL1 and Epac promote cellular proliferation because of their activating effects on Akt. Employing macrophages, we have studied the mechanisms whereby these proteins function in the regulation of Akt kinase activity. Cells were treated with 8-CPT-2-O-Me-cAMP, a cAMP analog which acts selectively and specifically via Epac1. Epac1 co-immunoprecipitated with TCL1 in plasma membrane and nuclear fractions of 8-CPT-2-O-Me-cAMP-stimulated macrophages. Interaction of TCL1 and Epac1 was also observed in a [125I]GST-Epac1 pulldown assay. A two-threefold increase in Akt Thr-308 and Akt Ser-473 protein kinase activities and their phosphoprotein levels was observed in TCL1 immunoprecipitates of plasma membranes and nuclei of the treated cells. Elevated Akt Thr-308 protein kinase activity and its phosphoprotein levels were significantly reduced in TCL1 immunoprecipitates of plasma membranes of 8-CPT-2-O-Me-cAMP-treated cells where Epac1 gene expression was silenced. In contrast, Akt Ser-473 protein kinase activity and its phosphoprotein levels were reduced only in plasma membranes. Our studies suggest that a ternary complex of TCL1, Epac1, and Akt forms in activated macrophages both promoting Akt activation and regulating intracellular distribution of Akt.","['Misra, Uma K', 'Kaczowka, Steven J', 'Pizzo, Salvatore V']","['Misra UK', 'Kaczowka SJ', 'Pizzo SV']","['Department of Pathology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC 27710, United States.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20071012,England,Cell Signal,Cellular signalling,8904683,"['0 (Epac protein, mouse)', '0 (Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Double-Stranded)', '0 (Tcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Thionucleotides)', ""41941-66-6 (8-((4-chlorophenyl)thio)cyclic-3',5'-AMP)"", 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Membrane/*metabolism', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cyclic AMP/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors/*metabolism', 'Macrophages, Peritoneal/cytology/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*metabolism', 'RNA, Double-Stranded/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'Thionucleotides/*pharmacology', 'Transfection']",2007/11/13 09:00,2008/06/12 09:00,['2007/11/13 09:00'],"['2007/05/09 00:00 [received]', '2007/09/19 00:00 [revised]', '2007/10/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/11/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/12 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0898-6568(07)00304-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.cellsig.2007.10.008 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Signal. 2008 Jan;20(1):130-8. doi: 10.1016/j.cellsig.2007.10.008.

Ultimately, molecularly based designer pharmaceuticals may emerge from this research, such as the case of trastuzumab (Herceptin) in HER-2/neu positive breast cancer, and imatinib (Gleevec) in chronic myelocytic leukemia and gastrointestinal stromal tumors. Importantly, these molecular findings may fuel significant clues to cancer control. This background is mentioned since surveillance and management of pancreatic cancer, a major concern of this manuscript, has been uniformly unsuccessful as evidenced by the close correspondence between its incidence and its mortality. Yet knowledge about its genetic and molecular pathology will hopefully ameliorate this vexing problem. One molecular genetic clue is the recently identified palladin mutation in two pancreatic cancer prone families. However, caution must be used toward the palladin mutation, as several recent publications have questioned its significance as a pancreatic cancer causing mutation. We provide a concise description of pancreatic cancer in concert with malignant melanoma in the familial atypical multiple mole melanoma (FAMMM) syndrome as a potential preventive model. This knowledge should help clinicians and basic scientists seize on the opportunity to develop more sensitive and specific screening and management programs in this disease; while a relatively small subset of pancreatic cancer may be readily identifiable through its FAMMM phenotype, coupled with its CDKN2A mutation, this hereditary disorder, given a keen knowledge of its natural history and molecular genetics, may prove to be an effective clinical preventive model.","['Lynch, Henry T', 'Fusaro, Ramon M', 'Lynch, Jane F', 'Brand, Randall']","['Lynch HT', 'Fusaro RM', 'Lynch JF', 'Brand R']","['Department of Preventive Medicine and Public Health, Creighton University School of Medicine, Omaha, NE 68178, USA. htlynch@creighton.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20071109,Netherlands,Fam Cancer,Familial cancer,100898211,['0 (CA-19-9 Antigen)'],IM,"['CA-19-9 Antigen/blood', 'Cohort Studies', 'Dysplastic Nevus Syndrome/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Genes, p16', 'Genetic Testing', 'Humans', 'Melanoma/*genetics/*prevention & control', 'Molecular Biology', 'Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia/epidemiology/*genetics/*prevention & control', 'Pancreatic Neoplasms/epidemiology/*genetics/*prevention & control', 'Pedigree']",2007/11/10 09:00,2008/07/09 09:00,['2007/11/10 09:00'],"['2007/07/10 00:00 [received]', '2007/10/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/11/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/09 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/10 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s10689-007-9166-4 [doi]'],ppublish,Fam Cancer. 2008;7(1):103-12. doi: 10.1007/s10689-007-9166-4.

Few studies have examined the prognostic significance of karyotypes in patients who underwent HSCT for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). The objective of this study was to evaluate the significance of pretransplantation cytogenetic status in relation to outcomes following HSCT in CML patients. DESIGN AND SETTING: Case series study at Instituto Nacional do Cancer (INCA), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. METHODS: Cytogenetic analysis was performed by G banding on 39 patients treated with HSCT. RESULTS: Thirty-one patients were in the chronic phase and eight were in the accelerated phase. Prior to HSCT, additional chromosomal abnormalities on the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome were found in 11 patients. The most frequent additional abnormality was a double Ph, which was observed in four cases. Following HSCT, full chimeras were observed in 31 patients (79.5%). Among these, 23 (82.3%) had presented Ph as the sole abnormality. Mixed chimeras were observed in seven patients, of which three had additional abnormalities. Only one case did not present any cytogenetic response. Five patients presented cytogenetic relapse associated with clinical relapse following HSCT. Twenty-seven patients are still alive and present complete hematological and cytogenetic remission. CONCLUSION: In our study, the presence of additional abnormalities was not associated with worse outcome and relapse risk. Also, no differences in survival rates were observed. Our study supports the view that classical cytogenetic analysis remains an important tool regarding HSCT outcome.","['Otero, Luize', 'Ornellas, Maria Helena', 'de Azevedo, Alexandre Mello', 'Tavares, Rita de Cassia', 'Pires, Virginia', 'Abdelhay, Eliana', 'Bouzas, Luis Fernando', 'Fernandez, Teresa de Souza']","['Otero L', 'Ornellas MH', 'de Azevedo AM', 'Tavares Rde C', 'Pires V', 'Abdelhay E', 'Bouzas LF', 'Fernandez Tde S']","['Cytogenetic Laboratory, Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, Instituto Nacional do Cancer, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. luizeotero@hotmail.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Brazil,Sao Paulo Med J,Sao Paulo medical journal = Revista paulista de medicina,100897261,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Brazil/epidemiology', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation Conditioning']",2007/11/10 09:00,2008/09/23 09:00,['2007/11/10 09:00'],"['2006/07/03 00:00 [received]', '2007/06/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/11/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/23 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1516-31802007000400011 [pii]', '10.1590/s1516-31802007000400011 [doi]']",ppublish,Sao Paulo Med J. 2007 Jul 5;125(4):246-9. doi: 10.1590/s1516-31802007000400011.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

More recently, another structural analogue of etodolac, SDX-308, has displayed in vitro cytotoxic activity on tumor lines and in vivo antitumor efficacy in mice. SDX-308 has high antimyeloma activity and shows synergism in combination with other drugs for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). In addition SDX-308 inhibits osteoclast (OCL) formation resulting in complete abrogation of bone resorption. Therefore, SDX-308 might be an attractive drug for the treatment of diseases with increased OCL activity, such as osteolytic lesions in multiple myeloma and metastatic carcinomas as well as osteoporosis.

Convergent studies suggest that p53 and STAT1 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 1) cooperate in the induction of cell death. We show that these drugs are also activators of STAT1 in p53-expressing cells, but not in p53-null cells. STAT1 activation was obtained in the presence of both the secretion inhibitor brefeldine A and the inhibitor of RNA synthesis, actinomycin D. p53-dependent STAT1 activation was reversed by overexpression of MDM2 and siRNAs against p53. Genetic analysis of p53 showed that expression of transcriptionally inactive p53 punctual mutants markedly increased Y701-STAT1 phosphorylation, and suggests that the p53 DNA-binding domain was alternatively involved in STAT1 activation or p53 multimerization. Immunoprecipitation experiments showed that ataxia telangiectasia mutated, p53, STAT1 and c-Abl1 (Abelson murine leukaemia viral oncogene homologue 1) were associated together. Treatment of cells with the c-Abl1 tyrosine kinase inhibitor STI571 decreased STAT1 activation by genotoxic drugs. Finally, genotoxic agents sensitized cells in response to very low doses of both interferon alpha and gamma (IFNalpha and gamma). These results show that genotoxic drugs induce STAT1 activation, an effect that depends on p53 protein but not on p53 transcriptional activity, and point to a novel pathway of STAT1 activation by genotoxic drugs, with involvement of c-Abl1 tyrosine kinase in sensitizing cells to IFN response.","['Youlyouz-Marfak, I', 'Gachard, N', 'Le Clorennec, C', 'Najjar, I', 'Baran-Marszak, F', 'Reminieras, L', 'May, E', 'Bornkamm, G W', 'Fagard, R', 'Feuillard, J']","['Youlyouz-Marfak I', 'Gachard N', 'Le Clorennec C', 'Najjar I', 'Baran-Marszak F', 'Reminieras L', 'May E', 'Bornkamm GW', 'Fagard R', 'Feuillard J']","[""Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, UMR CNRS 6101, Faculte de Medecine de Limoges, Universite de Limoges, CHU Dupuytren, Laboratoire d'Hematologie, Limoges, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071109,England,Cell Death Differ,Cell death and differentiation,9437445,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Protein Synthesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (STAT1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT1 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)', '20350-15-6 (Brefeldin A)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', '9008-11-1 (Interferons)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (MDM2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzamides', 'Brefeldin A/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cisplatin/pharmacology', 'Dactinomycin/pharmacology', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Interferons/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Protein Synthesis Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2/metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*metabolism', 'Vidarabine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology']",2007/11/10 09:00,2008/04/04 09:00,['2007/11/10 09:00'],"['2007/11/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/04 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['4402270 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.cdd.4402270 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Death Differ. 2008 Feb;15(2):376-85. doi: 10.1038/sj.cdd.4402270.

Although imatinib is highly effective and well tolerated, the development of resistance represents a clinical challenge. Since the most frequently identified mechanism of acquired imatinib resistance is bcr-abl kinase domain point mutations, periodic hematologic, cytogenetic, and molecular monitoring is critical throughout imatinib therapy. Once cytogenetic remission is achieved, residual disease can be monitored by bcr-abl transcript levels as assayed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Detection of bcr-abl mutants prior to and during imatinib therapy can aid in risk stratification as well as in determining therapeutic strategies. Thus, mutation screening is indicated in patients lacking or losing hematologic response. Moreover, search for mutations should also be performed when a 3-log reduction of bcr-abl transcripts is not achieved or there is a reproducible increase of transcript levels. In patients harboring mutations which confer imatinib resistance, novel second line tyrosine kinase inhibitors have demonstrated encouraging efficacy with low toxicity. Only the T315I bcr-abl mutant has proved totally resistant to all clinically available bcr-abl inhibitors.

Cases with leptomeningeal involvement reported in the literature mostly do not discuss the definition of CLL-associated meningeosis and the exclusion of neuroborreliosis. PATIENT AND METHODS: We present the case of a 75-year-old male patient who was admitted to a rural hospital with ataxia, disorientation, and signs of progressive CLL disease. He was diagnosed of suspicious meningeosis leukemica, and treatment was started with dexamethasone for leukemic CNS involvement. RESULTS: When referred to our center, careful immunophenotyping of the CNS lymphocytes as well as assessment for infectious causes of lymphocytic meningitis led to the diagnosis of Lyme disease/neuroborreliosis. An antibiotic regimen with ceftriaxone for 3 weeks resulted in complete remission of all symptoms. There was no need for CLL treatment. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, this case report should alert clinicians that lymphocytic meningeal involvement in CLL patients accounts for the rare leukemic meningeosis only if cerebrospinal fluid cells show a predominating immunophenotype of typical BCLL cells, i.e. by flow cytometry, and if any infectious cause including Lyme disease has been ruled out.","['Schweighofer, Carmen D', 'Fatkenheuer, Gerd', 'Staib, Peter', 'Hallek, Michael', 'Reiser, Marcel']","['Schweighofer CD', 'Fatkenheuer G', 'Staib P', 'Hallek M', 'Reiser M']","['Department of Internal Medicine I, University of Cologne, Germany. carmen.schweighofer@uk-koeln.de']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20071016,Switzerland,Onkologie,Onkologie,7808556,,IM,"['Diagnosis, Differential', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*complications/*diagnosis', 'Lyme Disease/*complications/*diagnosis', 'Male', 'Meningitis/*complications/*diagnosis', 'Middle Aged']",2007/11/10 09:00,2007/12/13 09:00,['2007/11/10 09:00'],"['2007/11/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/13 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['108920 [pii]', '10.1159/000108920 [doi]']",ppublish,Onkologie. 2007 Nov;30(11):564-6. doi: 10.1159/000108920.

Our previous study has demonstrated that, compared with RARalpha, PML-RARalpha had reduced intranuclear mobility accompanied with mislocalization. To understand the molecular basis for the altered dynamics of PML-RARalpha fusion protein, we performed FRAP analysis at a single cell level. Results indicated that three known sumoylation site mutated PML-RARalpha had same intracellular localization and reduced mobility as wild-type counterpart. The coiled-coil domain of PML is responsible for the aberrant dynamics of PML-RARalpha. In addition, we revealed that co-repressor SMRT co-localized with PML-RARalpha, resulting in the immobilization of SMRT while ATRA treatment eliminated their association and reversed the immobile effect of SMRT. Furthermore, co-activator CBP, co-localized with PML-RARalpha in an ATRA-independent way, was demonstrated as a high dynamic intranuclear molecule. These results would shed new insights for the molecular mechanisms of PML-RARalpha-associated leukemogenesis.","['Huang, Ying', 'Qiu, Jihui', 'Chen, Guoqiang', 'Dong, Shuo']","['Huang Y', 'Qiu J', 'Chen G', 'Dong S']","['Department of Pathophysiology, Key Laboratory of Cell Differentiation and Apoptosis of Chinese Ministry of Education, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine (SJTU-SM), No. 280, Chong-Qing South Road, Shanghai 200025, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071106,United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (NCOR2 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Receptor Co-Repressor 2)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Kidney/*chemistry/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Receptor Co-Repressor 2', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Protein Transport/physiology', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/*metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/*metabolism', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*metabolism']",2007/11/10 09:00,2007/12/22 09:00,['2007/11/10 09:00'],"['2007/10/21 00:00 [received]', '2007/10/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/11/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/22 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-291X(07)02333-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2007.10.184 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2008 Jan 11;365(2):258-65. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2007.10.184.

The role of adjuvant therapy in stage III colon cancer is well defined. The results from the MOSAIC trial (Multicenter International Study of Oxaliplatin/5-Fluorouracil/Leucovorin in the Adjuvant Treatment of Colon Cancer) and the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project C-07 trial confirm a definite disease-free survival (DFS) benefit with the addition of oxaliplatin to either infusional or bolus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin (5-FU/LV). The Xeloda in Adjuvant Colon Cancer Therapy (X-ACT) trial showed capecitabine to be of equivalent clinical benefit to bolus 5-FU/LV. However, adjuvant trials with irinotecan, including Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB 89803), the Pan-European Trial in Adjuvant Colorectal Cancer 3 (PETACC-3), and the French ACCORD trial, have not shown a significant DFS advantage. In contrast, in patients with stage II disease, a small survival benefit of 1% to 5% exists with chemotherapy. Perhaps the analysis of molecular markers in combination with high-risk histopathologic features will help increase patient specificity and identify subsets of patients with stage II colon cancer who will derive a survival benefit with adjuvant therapy. The current Intergroup study stratifying stage II patients based on presence of microsatellite instability and loss of heterozygosity 18q allele will help us better understand the risk versus benefit observed.","['Aranha, Olivia', 'Benson, Al B 3rd']","['Aranha O', 'Benson AB 3rd']","['Robert H.

Tissue microarrays (TMAs) are useful for high-throughput analysis of protein expression of target genes in acute leukemia samples and for validation of gene microarray analysis. Using cryopreserved samples of pediatric acute leukemia bone marrow aspirates, we constructed TMA from as few as 1 million cells. Bone marrow core biopsies from the same patients were included on the same TMA for comparison. A panel of 15 immunohistochemical markers typically used for diagnosis as well as those targeting recently characterized, prognostically relevant molecules of interest in pediatric acute leukemia was used to evaluate protein expression. Staining results confirm that suspension cells from bone marrow aspirates can be effectively used to derive protein expression data from multiple cases simultaneously with comparable efficacy to that of biopsy tissue. This method allows for new markers of diagnostic, prognostic, or therapeutic importance to be screened on large numbers of study patients. Furthermore, this technique may facilitate the inclusion of small samples, aspirates, and body fluids in large-scale studies of protein expression in clinical trials and protocols in which tissue biopsies are often unavailable.","['Hazard, Florette K', 'Zhao, Shuchun', 'Schiffman, Joshua D', 'Lacayo, Norman J', 'Dahl, Gary V', 'Natkunam, Yasodha']","['Hazard FK', 'Zhao S', 'Schiffman JD', 'Lacayo NJ', 'Dahl GV', 'Natkunam Y']","['Department of Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20070803,United States,Pediatr Dev Pathol,Pediatric and developmental pathology : the official journal of the Society for Pediatric Pathology and the Paediatric Pathology Society,9809673,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/metabolism', 'Biopsy', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism/*pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Tissue Array Analysis/*methods']",2007/11/10 09:00,2008/10/29 09:00,['2007/11/10 09:00'],"['2007/04/01 00:00 [received]', '2007/07/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/11/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/29 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['07-04-0253 [pii]', '10.2350/07-04-0253.1 [doi]']",ppublish,Pediatr Dev Pathol. 2008 Jul-Aug;11(4):283-90. doi: 10.2350/07-04-0253.1.

One hundred and seventy-five consistently differentially expressed proteins were identified out of more than 1600 protein spots per gel. Of these 175 protein spots, 38 of the 41 most highly expressed proteins were identified by MS analysis (MALDI-TOF), involving different cellular programs such as DNA repair (Rad50), cell cycle control (Mad1L1), transcription (SAFB), and apoptosis (Luca-15 protein). Expression data were confirmed by Western blot analysis of identified proteins and 2-D gel hybridization of proteins with known overexpression (G1/S-specific cyclin-D1, apoptosis regulator Bcl-2). Comparison of proteome analysis to RNA expression array data revealed only a modest correlation of RNA and protein level emphasizing the relevance of post-translational regulation in lymphomagenesis (p = 0.36).

The fusion oncoprotein blocks leukemic cell differentiation, and it also induces growth arrest with increased sensitivity to apoptosis induction. Such dichotomous functions make it difficult to clarify the role of AML1-ETO in leukemogenesis. Here, we systematically showed that constitutively and overexpressed AML1-ETO protein was cleaved to four fragments of 70, 49, 40 and 25 kDa by activated caspase-3 during apoptosis induction by extrinsic mitochondrial and death receptor signaling pathways. The in vitro proteolytic system combined with MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometer confirmed that AML1-ETO and wild-type ETO but not RUNX1 (AML1) proteins were direct substrates of apoptosis executioner caspase-3. Site-directed mutagenesis analyses identified two nonclassical aspartates (TMPD188 and LLLD368) as caspase-3-targeted sites in the AML1-ETO sequence. When these two aspartates were mutated into alanines, more intriguingly, the apoptosis-amplified action of AML1-ETO induction completely disappeared, while inducible expression of the caspase-3-cleaved 70 kDa fragment of AML1-ETO after tetracycline removal is sufficient to enhance apoptotic sensitivity. Further investigations on the potential in vivo effects of such a cleavage and its possible role in leukemogenesis would provide new insights for understanding the biology and treatment of AML1-ETO-associated leukemia.","['Lu, Y', 'Peng, Z-G', 'Yuan, T-T', 'Yin, Q-Q', 'Xia, L', 'Chen, G-Q']","['Lu Y', 'Peng ZG', 'Yuan TT', 'Yin QQ', 'Xia L', 'Chen GQ']","['Department of Pathophysiology, Key Laboratory of Cell Differentiation and Apoptosis of Ministry of Education of China, Shanghai Jiao-Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071108,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (AML1-ETO fusion protein, human)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (RUNX1T1 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '30KYC7MIAI (Aspartic Acid)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Substitution', '*Apoptosis', 'Aspartic Acid', 'Binding Sites', 'Caspase 3/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/genetics/*metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydrolysis', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/pathology', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/*metabolism', 'Peptide Fragments/*analysis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism']",2007/11/09 09:00,2008/03/28 09:00,['2007/11/09 09:00'],"['2007/11/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/28 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/09 09:00 [entrez]']","['2405020 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2405020 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2008 Feb;22(2):378-86. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2405020.

There are more than 500 miRNA genes reported in the human genome, constituting one of the largest classes of regulatory genes. Increasing experimental evidence supports the idea of aberrant miRNA expression in cancer pathogenesis. We analyzed the pattern of miRNA expression in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells and our results showed a global reduction in miRNA expression levels in CLL cells associated to a consistent underexpression of miR-181a, let-7a and miR-30d. We observed overexpression of miR-155 and a set of five miRNAs that are differentially expressed between patients with different clinical outcomes. Five novel miRNA candidates cloned from leukemic cells are reported. Surprisingly, predicted mRNA targets for these novel miRNA revealed a high proportion of targets located in a small region of chromosome 1, which is frequently altered in human cancer. Additionally, several targets were shared by at least two of miRNA candidates. Predicted targets included several genes recently described as tumor suppressors. These data could afford new avenues for exploring innovative pathways in CLL biology and therapy.","['Marton, S', 'Garcia, M R', 'Robello, C', 'Persson, H', 'Trajtenberg, F', 'Pritsch, O', 'Rovira, C', 'Naya, H', 'Dighiero, G', 'Cayota, A']","['Marton S', 'Garcia MR', 'Robello C', 'Persson H', 'Trajtenberg F', 'Pritsch O', 'Rovira C', 'Naya H', 'Dighiero G', 'Cayota A']","['Molecular Oncology Unit, Institut Pasteur, Montevideo, Uruguay.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071108,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,['0 (MicroRNAs)'],IM,"['Down-Regulation', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/etiology/*genetics', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics/physiology', 'Up-Regulation']",2007/11/09 09:00,2008/03/28 09:00,['2007/11/09 09:00'],"['2007/11/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/28 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/09 09:00 [entrez]']","['2405022 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2405022 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2008 Feb;22(2):330-8. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2405022.

PML is subjected to post-translational modifications such as sumoylation and phosphorylation. However, the physiological significance of these modifications, especially for myeloid cell differentiation, remains unclear. In this report, we found that four serine residues in the PML C-terminal region are highly phosphorylated in a myeloid cell line. Wild-type PML accelerated G-CSF-induced granulocytic differentiation, but a phosphorylation-deficient PML mutant failed. PML interacted with C/EBP epsilon, a transcription factor essential for granulopoiesis, activated C/EBP epsilon-mediated transcription in concert with p300 and accelerated C/EBP epsilon-induced granulocytic differentiation. Phosphorylation of PML was required for stimulating C/EBP epsilon-dependent transcription and accelerating C/EBP epsilon-induced granulocytic differentiation. We also found that PML phosphorylation was required for stimulation of PU.1-dependent transcription and acceleration of PU.1-induced granulocytic differentiation. These results suggest that phosphorylation plays essential roles in the regulation of PML to accelerate granulocytic differentiation through multiple pathways.","['Tagata, Y', 'Yoshida, H', 'Nguyen, L A', 'Kato, H', 'Ichikawa, H', 'Tashiro, F', 'Kitabayashi, I']","['Tagata Y', 'Yoshida H', 'Nguyen LA', 'Kato H', 'Ichikawa H', 'Tashiro F', 'Kitabayashi I']","['Molecular Oncology Division, National Cancer Center Research Institute, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071108,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Cebpe protein, mouse)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Pml protein, mouse)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (proto-oncogene protein Spi-1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins/*physiology', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Granulocytes/*cytology', 'Mice', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*physiology', 'Trans-Activators/*physiology', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*metabolism']",2007/11/09 09:00,2008/03/28 09:00,['2007/11/09 09:00'],"['2007/11/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/28 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/09 09:00 [entrez]']","['2405024 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2405024 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2008 Feb;22(2):273-80. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2405024.

Their identification and functional characterization are therefore important for the establishment of rational therapies. Here, we investigated genomic amplification at 7q22 in the T-cell lymphoma cell line SU-DHL-1 belonging to the subtype of anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (ALCL). Cytogenetic analysis mapped this amplicon to 86-95 Mb. Copy-number determination quantified the amplification level at 5- to 6-fold. Expression analysis of genes located within this region identified cyclin-dependent kinase 6 (CDK6) as a potential amplification target. In comparison with control cell lines, SU-DHL-1 expressed considerably higher levels of CDK6. Functionally, SU-DHL-1 cells exhibited reduced sensitivity to rapamycin treatment, as indicated by cell growth and cell cycle analysis. Rapamycin reportedly inhibits degradation of the CDK inhibitor p27 with concomitant downregulation of cyclin D3, implying a proliferative advantage for CDK6 overexpression. Amplification of the CDK6 locus was analyzed in primary T-cell lymphoma samples and, while detected infrequently in those classified as ALCL (1%), was detected in 23% of peripheral T-cell lymphomas not otherwise specified. Taken together, analysis of the 7q22 amplicon identified CDK6 as an important cell cycle regulator in T-cell lymphomas, representing a novel potential target for rational therapy.","['Nagel, S', 'Leich, E', 'Quentmeier, H', 'Meyer, C', 'Kaufmann, M', 'Drexler, H G', 'Zettl, A', 'Rosenwald, A', 'MacLeod, R A F']","['Nagel S', 'Leich E', 'Quentmeier H', 'Meyer C', 'Kaufmann M', 'Drexler HG', 'Zettl A', 'Rosenwald A', 'MacLeod RA']","['Department of Human and Animal Cell Cultures, DSMZ, Braunschweig, Germany. sna@dsmz.de']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20071108,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 6)', 'W36ZG6FT64 (Sirolimus)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromosome Aberrations', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 6/*genetics', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Drug Resistance/genetics', '*Gene Dosage', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Large-Cell, Anaplastic/enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/enzymology/*genetics/pathology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell, Peripheral/enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Sirolimus/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2007/11/09 09:00,2008/03/28 09:00,['2007/11/09 09:00'],"['2007/11/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/28 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/09 09:00 [entrez]']","['2405028 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2405028 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2008 Feb;22(2):387-92. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2405028.

Severe congenital neutropenia occurs with sporadic, autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive and X-linked recessive inheritance, as well as in a variety of multisystem syndromes. A principal stimulus for this review is the identification of novel genetic defects and pathophysiological insights into the role of neutrophil apoptosis. RECENT FINDINGS: The recent findings include identification of mutations in HAX1 in autosomal recessive severe congenital neutropenia (Kostmann disease), a large epidemiological study estimating the risk of progression from severe congenital neutropenia to leukemia, a better understanding of how heterozygous mutations in neutrophil elastase (ELA2) cause severe congenital neutropenia, molecular characterization of a novel syndromic form of severe congenital neutropenia called p14 deficiency and new animal models for several syndromic forms of severe congenital neutropenia. SUMMARY: We consider the numerous genes mutated in severe congenital neutropenia, the many attempts to make animal models of severe congenital neutropenia, and the results from both human and mouse studies investigating the molecular mechanisms of neutrophil apoptosis. Investigations of how severe congenital neutropenia genes and apoptosis pathways are connected should lead to a better understanding of the pathogenesis of neutropenia and apoptosis pathways relevant to many cell types.","['Schaffer, Alejandro A', 'Klein, Christoph']","['Schaffer AA', 'Klein C']","['Computational Biology Branch, National Center for Biotechnology Information, National Institutes of Health, Department of Health and Human Services, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Allergy Clin Immunol,Current opinion in allergy and clinical immunology,100936359,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (HAX1 protein, human)', '0 (Proteins)', 'EC 3.4.21.36 (Pancreatic Elastase)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/genetics/*immunology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Humans', 'Neutropenia/*congenital/*genetics/immunology', 'Neutrophils/*immunology', 'Pancreatic Elastase/genetics/immunology', 'Proteins/genetics/immunology']",2007/11/09 09:00,2008/03/07 09:00,['2007/11/09 09:00'],"['2007/11/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/07 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/09 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/ACI.0b013e3282f1d690 [doi]', '00130832-200712000-00005 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Opin Allergy Clin Immunol. 2007 Dec;7(6):481-94. doi: 10.1097/ACI.0b013e3282f1d690.,,"['Z01 LM000097-06/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States', 'Z99 LM999999/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC2720578,['NIHMS41834'],,149,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sixty-five patients received myeloablative HSCT, and 16 patients received fludarabine (Fd), low-dose busulfan (Bu), and antithymocyte globulin (ATG) in nonmyeloablative HSCT. We determined overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS), as well as the occurrence of acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). The incidences of acute GVHD of grades II to IV were 14.0% and 18.7% for the myeloablative and nonmyeloablative groups, respectively. The incidence of chronic GVHD was significantly higher in the nonmyeloablative group (80% versus 66%). Five-year OS and DFS rates were significantly higher in nonmyeloablative group (70% for both), compared with 56% and 54%, respectively, for the myeloablative group. A univariate analysis, however, revealed a strong but statistically insignificant trend for enhanced overall OS and DFS in the nonmyeloablative group (P = .1 and .07, respectively). A multivariate analysis with the factors of treatment, age, sex, acute and chronic GVHD, and disease status at the time of transplantation revealed that both OS and DFS were significantly higher in the nonmyeloablative group than in the myeloablative group. These findings suggest that nonmyeloablative Fd/Bu/ATG treatment is at least not inferior (and quite probably superior) in terms of patient outcome compared with standard myeloablative therapy. Further larger-scale randomized clinical trials are warranted to clarify the efficacy of this treatment regimen.","['Chen, Ming-Huang', 'Chiou, Tzeon-Jye', 'Lin, Peng-Chan', 'Gau, Jyh-Pyng', 'Hsu, Hui-Chi', 'Hsiao, Liang-Tsai', 'Liu, Jin-Hwang', 'Chen, Po-Min']","['Chen MH', 'Chiou TJ', 'Lin PC', 'Gau JP', 'Hsu HC', 'Hsiao LT', 'Liu JH', 'Chen PM']","['Division of Hematology & Oncology, Department of Medicine, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (Antilymphocyte Serum)', '0 (Immunologic Factors)', '0 (Myeloablative Agonists)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Antilymphocyte Serum/administration & dosage', 'Busulfan/administration & dosage', 'Child', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology/mortality', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Factors/administration & dosage', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/complications/*mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloablative Agonists/administration & dosage', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sex Factors', 'Survival Rate', '*Transplantation Conditioning', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives']",2007/11/09 09:00,2007/12/27 09:00,['2007/11/09 09:00'],"['2007/11/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/27 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/09 09:00 [entrez]']","['0T0W372184181K41 [pii]', '10.1532/IJH97.A10701 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2007 Oct;86(3):275-81. doi: 10.1532/IJH97.A10701.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, its effectiveness for cardiac involvement of CEL has remained unclear. We describe a 46-year-old man with CEL treated with imatinib. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and sequencing analyses revealed a FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion transcript with FIP1L1 intron 10 fused to PDGFRA exon 12, and fluorescent in situ hybridization analysis confirmed the interstitial deletion in chromosome 4q12. On admission, the patient had left heart failure accompanied by a large thrombus in the left ventricle. After pretreatment with furosemide and prednisolone, we started imatinib treatment at 100 mg/day. Eosinophilia disappeared within 1 week, and the left ventricular thrombus was resolved within 5 months. At 6 months after starting imatinib, the patient showed grade 4 liver dysfunction. A liver biopsy revealed hepatocyte necrosis with lymphocyte infiltration. Fortunately, the FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion transcript had become undetectable, and imatinib treatment was stopped. The liver dysfunction resolved within a month. Although the CEL relapsed 6 months later, imatinib could be successfully resumed in combination with 25 mg/day of prednisolone. Thus, imatinib may be very effective for treating the early cardiac involvement of FIP1L1-PDGFRA-positive CEL, but it needs to be used cautiously.","['Arai, Ayako', 'Yan, Weihua', 'Wakabayashi, Shihoko', 'Hayashi, Shin', 'Inazawa, Johji', 'Miura, Osamu']","['Arai A', 'Yan W', 'Wakabayashi S', 'Hayashi S', 'Inazawa J', 'Miura O']","['Department of Hematology, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan. ara.hema@tmd.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Sodium Potassium Chloride Symporter Inhibitors)', '0 (mRNA Cleavage and Polyadenylation Factors)', '7LXU5N7ZO5 (Furosemide)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor alpha)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Benzamides', 'Biopsy', '*Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 4/genetics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Exons/genetics', 'Female', 'Furosemide/administration & dosage', 'Glucocorticoids/administration & dosage', 'Heart Diseases/complications/drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Heart Ventricles/pathology', 'Hepatocytes/pathology', 'Humans', 'Hypereosinophilic Syndrome/*complications/drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Introns/genetics', 'Liver Diseases/drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Necrosis', '*Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', 'Piperazines/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Prednisolone/administration & dosage', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', '*Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor alpha/genetics', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Sodium Potassium Chloride Symporter Inhibitors/administration & dosage', 'Thrombosis/complications/drug therapy/genetics/pathology', '*mRNA Cleavage and Polyadenylation Factors/genetics']",2007/11/09 09:00,2007/12/27 09:00,['2007/11/09 09:00'],"['2007/11/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/27 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/09 09:00 [entrez]']","['38N67841R91742V5 [pii]', '10.1532/IJH97.07032 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2007 Oct;86(3):233-7. doi: 10.1532/IJH97.07032.,,,,,,,,19,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Following Goeman and Buhlmann's recent review, we compared statistical performance of three methods, namely Global Test, ANCOVA Global Test, and SAM-GS, that test ""self-contained null hypotheses"" Via. subject sampling. The three methods were compared based on a simulation experiment and analyses of three real-world microarray datasets. RESULTS: In the simulation experiment, we found that the use of the asymptotic distribution in the two Global Tests leads to a statistical test with an incorrect size. Specifically, p-values calculated by the scaled chi2 distribution of Global Test and the asymptotic distribution of ANCOVA Global Test are too liberal, while the asymptotic distribution with a quadratic form of the Global Test results in p-values that are too conservative. The two Global Tests with permutation-based inference, however, gave a correct size. While the three methods showed similar power using permutation inference after a proper standardization of gene expression data, SAM-GS showed slightly higher power than the Global Tests. In the analysis of a real-world microarray dataset, the two Global Tests gave markedly different results, compared to SAM-GS, in identifying pathways whose gene expressions are associated with p53 mutation in cancer cell lines. A proper standardization of gene expression variances is necessary for the two Global Tests in order to produce biologically sensible results. After the standardization, the three methods gave very similar biologically-sensible results, with slightly higher statistical significance given by SAM-GS. The three methods gave similar patterns of results in the analysis of the other two microarray datasets. CONCLUSION: An appropriate standardization makes the performance of all three methods similar, given the use of permutation-based inference. SAM-GS tends to have slightly higher power in the lower alpha-level region (i.e. gene sets that are of the greatest interest). Global Test and ANCOVA Global Test have the important advantage of being able to analyze continuous and survival phenotypes and to adjust for covariates.

While administration of immunochemotherapy comprising the CD20-antibody rituximab is a well-established treatment strategy in patients with normal renal function, little information on safety and efficacy is available in the setting of ESRD. Here we describe for the first time a hemodialysis patient suffering from diffuse large B-cell Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (DLBCL) who was treated with polychemotherapy (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone) in combination with rituximab (R-CHOP). We observed no major adverse events and treatment resulted in a partial remission of the DLBCL. Thus, administration of R-CHOP may be considered as a safe therapeutic option in this setting. Of note, this patient had a previous history of hairy cell leukemia.

The peripheral blood, bone marrow cytology, clinical features and stage at diagnosis were studied. Treatment modalities, response to treatment and survival outcome of the patients were analysed. Sixty patients (15 men and 45 women) were seen, with female preponderance (M : F ratio,1 : 3). The CLL incidence was 36.4% of total leukaemias. The median age was 56 years with peak age group at 51-60 years while 15% were below 40 years. Major clinical findings include lymphadenopathy (91.7%), anaemia (58.3%), abdominal swelling (58.3%), and splenomegaly (50%) with 53 patients (88.3%) presenting as International (Binet) stage B and C while only seven patients (11.7%) were seen in stage A. The least clinical presentation includes Richter's syndrome in 3.3% of cases and herpes Zoster skin manifestations in two patients (3.3%). There was a strong association between the blood counts at diagnosis and outcome of therapy. The 2-year survival for young (<55 years) and older (>55 years) CLL patients was 27.2% and 28.9%, respectively, which is still very poor because of a number of strong limiting factors. CLL is not rare in Southern Nigeria and its presentations are similar to cases seen worldwide. Contrary to existing literature a female predominance was observed in this study with majority of patients seeking medical intervention late. It is therefore recommended that future research into the genetic make up/HLA typing of patients of African descent is needed to clarify some of the differences observed.","['Omoti, C E', 'Awodu, O A', 'Bazuaye, G N']","['Omoti CE', 'Awodu OA', 'Bazuaye GN']","['Department of Haematology, University of Benin Teaching Hospital, Benin city, Nigeria. ediomoti@yahoo.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Int J Lab Hematol,International journal of laboratory hematology,101300213,,IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Blacks', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/*mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nigeria/epidemiology', 'Prospective Studies', 'Sex Factors', 'Survival Rate']",2007/11/09 09:00,2007/12/27 09:00,['2007/11/09 09:00'],"['2007/11/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/27 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/09 09:00 [entrez]']","['CLH888 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1751-553X.2007.00888.x [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Lab Hematol. 2007 Dec;29(6):426-32. doi: 10.1111/j.1751-553X.2007.00888.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

True foetal erythrocytes containing foetal amounts of HbF can also occur in the adult circulation during the leakage of HbF-containing cells from the foetus to the maternal circulation. In normal adults, HbF is restricted to a small proportion (3-7%) of red blood cells (RBC), termed 'F cells'. Techniques estimating the amount of HbF use lysates prepared from RBC, whereas those that estimate the adult F cell count use intact RBC. An accurate assessment of adult F cells in sickle cell disorders is important because increased adult F cells are associated with decreased morbidity in these disorders. In the present study, HbF levels were measured and adult F cell numbers were estimated in 100 blood samples (25 normal individuals, 25 sickle heterozygotes, 25 sickle homozygotes and 25 sickle beta-thalassaemia cases), using high pressure liquid chromatography for HbF levels, and flow cytometry and the Kleihauer-Betke (KB) acid elution microscope slide method for cell counts. Flow cytometry gave a more accurate assessment of adult F cells, eliminating any manual error, as compared to KB, which was less sensitive and precise as it is based on subjective visual interpretation.","['Italia, K Y', 'Colah, R', 'Mohanty, D']","['Italia KY', 'Colah R', 'Mohanty D']","['Institute of Immunohaematology (ICMR), K.E.M.

Most protocols consist of 3 individual steps: maintenance, embryoid body (EB) formation, and differentiation.

These problems were addressed by encapsulating undifferentiated murine ESCs (mESCs) in 1.1% (w/v) low-viscosity alginic acid, 0.1% (v/v) porcine gelatin hydrogel beads (d = 2.3 mm). Six hundred beads containing 10,000 mESCs per bead were cultured in a 50-mL high-aspect-ratio vessel bioreactor. Bioreactor cultures were rotated at 17.5 revolutions per min, cultured in maintenance medium containing leukemia inhibitory factor for 3 days, replaced with EB formation medium for 5 days followed by osteogenic medium containing L-ascorbate-2-phosphate (50 microg/mL), beta-glycerophosphate (10 mM), and dexamethasone (1 microM) for an additional 21 days. After 29 days, 84 times as many cells per bead were observed and mineralized matrix was formed within the alginate beads. Osteogenesis was confirmed using von Kossa, Alizarin Red S staining, alkaline phosphatase activity, immunocytochemistry for osteocalcin, OB-cadherin, collagen type I, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, microcomputed tomography (micro-computed tomography) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopic imaging.

In this study, we attempted to evaluate the relationship between viability of freshly isolated leukemic cells and the clinical response. Cell viability was evaluated in freshly isolated leukemic cells from 84 patients with acute leukemia (AL) using 7-Amino-Actinomycin D and was correlated with the clinical response following induction chemotherapy. Patients with ALL who achieved complete remission (CR) had significantly lower mean live cell (70.9%) compared to those patients who did not achieve CR (93.3%) (p=0.02). Furthermore, ALL responders had also significantly higher mean early apoptotic cell (19.4%) as compared to non responders (5%) (p=0.04). No significant difference was found in the mean live / early apoptotic cell count of responders and non responders of AML patients. The probability of obtaining CR in ALL patients was 3.7 and 2.7 times higher in those who had mean live cell count less than 70% and apoptotic cell count more than 10%, respectively. A lower cell viability and higher apoptosis in freshly isolated leukemic cells at the time of diagnosis may indicate a favorable response in patients with ALL but may not provide any sufficient information in predicting the response in AML patients to induction chemotherapy.","['Bhushan, B', 'Ahuja, D', 'Verma, S', 'Saluja, S', 'Siddiqui, S', 'Kapur, S']","['Bhushan B', 'Ahuja D', 'Verma S', 'Saluja S', 'Siddiqui S', 'Kapur S']","['Institute of Pathology (Indian Council of Medical Research), Safdarjung Hospital Campus, New Delhi, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,J Exp Clin Cancer Res,Journal of experimental & clinical cancer research : CR,8308647,,IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Cell Survival', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Remission Induction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2007/11/09 09:00,2007/12/27 09:00,['2007/11/09 09:00'],"['2007/11/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/27 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/09 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Exp Clin Cancer Res. 2007 Sep;26(3):313-21.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Otolaryngologists should be familiar with the entity of invasive necrotizing tracheal aspergillosis. METHODS: In this report we describe a young patient with acute myeloid leukemia who was affected by invasive tracheal aspergillosis. This entity and the relevant literature are reviewed. RESULTS: On the basis of the presented clinical report, we discuss the clinical and pathologic characteristics of invasive tracheal aspergillosis as an opportunistic infection. The classic symptoms are of progressive dyspnea in an immunosuppressed patient. Diagnosis is via pathological evidence of fungal hyphae invading the endoluminal upper respiratory tree. The present patient was successfully treated with an azole antifungal agent, combined with tracheostomy for airway control. CONCLUSIONS: Invasive tracheal aspergillosis is a life-threatening fungal infection that affects immunosuppressed patients. Because the mortality rate is high, awareness of this entity is essential for early diagnosis and treatment. A favorable outcome in this type of invasive aspergillosis correlates with resolution of the bone marrow suppression and early antifungal medical therapy combined with aggressive surgical intervention for airway control, if needed.","['Warman, Meir', 'Lahav, Jonathan', 'Feldberg, Edit', 'Halperin, Doron']","['Warman M', 'Lahav J', 'Feldberg E', 'Halperin D']","['Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Kaplan Medical Center, Rehovot, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Ann Otol Rhinol Laryngol,"The Annals of otology, rhinology, and laryngology",0407300,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Triazoles)', 'JFU09I87TR (Voriconazole)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antifungal Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Aspergillosis/complications/*drug therapy/microbiology', 'Aspergillus flavus/isolation & purification', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Laryngoscopy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications', 'Opportunistic Infections/complications/*drug therapy/microbiology', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Tracheitis/*diagnosis/microbiology', 'Triazoles/*therapeutic use', 'Voriconazole']",2007/11/09 09:00,2007/12/06 09:00,['2007/11/09 09:00'],"['2007/11/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/09 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/000348940711601001 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Otol Rhinol Laryngol. 2007 Oct;116(10):713-6. doi: 10.1177/000348940711601001.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mutations within the ABL kinase domain that interfere with drug binding have been identified as the main mechanism of resistance to imatinib. Currently, more than 50 different BCR-ABL mutants conferring varying degrees of resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors have been identified. Nilotinib (Tasigna; Novartis) is a second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor with 30-fold higher potency against BCR-ABL kinase than imatinib. Notably, nilotinib is active against a wide range of imatinib-resistant or-intolerant patients, except for T315I. Results from the pivotal phase II studies of nilotinib for patients with CML after failure or intolerance to imatinib therapy indicate that nilotinib has a favorable toxicity profile and is highly efficacious in this setting. Studies exploring the efficacy of nilotinib as front-line therapy for patients with newly diagnosed CML are ongoing. Here, we review the preclinical and clinical development of nilotinib for the treatment of CML.","['Quintas-Cardama, Alfonso', 'Cortes, Jorge']","['Quintas-Cardama A', 'Cortes J']","['Department of Leukemia, the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Spain,Drugs Today (Barc),"Drugs of today (Barcelona, Spain : 1998)",101160518,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Controlled Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/physiopathology', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology/therapeutic use']",2007/11/08 09:00,2008/02/01 09:00,['2007/11/08 09:00'],"['2007/11/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/01 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['1122218 [pii]', '10.1358/dot.2007.43.10.1122218 [doi]']",ppublish,Drugs Today (Barc). 2007 Oct;43(10):691-702. doi: 10.1358/dot.2007.43.10.1122218.,,,,,,,,58,,['2007 Prous Science'],,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. PARTICIPANTS: 1.2 million UK women recruited into the Million Women Study, aged 50-64 during 1996-2001, and followed up, on average, for 5.4 years for cancer incidence and 7.0 years for cancer mortality. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Relative risks of incidence and mortality for all cancers, and for 17 specific types of cancer, according to body mass index, adjusted for age, geographical region, socioeconomic status, age at first birth, parity, smoking status, alcohol intake, physical activity, years since menopause, and use of hormone replacement therapy. RESULTS: 45,037 incident cancers and 17 203 deaths from cancer occurred over the follow-up period. Increasing body mass index was associated with an increased incidence of endometrial cancer (trend in relative risk per 10 units=2.89, 95% confidence interval 2.62 to 3.18), adenocarcinoma of the oesophagus (2.38, 1.59 to 3.56), kidney cancer (1.53, 1.27 to 1.84), leukaemia (1.50, 1.23 to 1.83), multiple myeloma (1.31, 1.04 to 1.65), pancreatic cancer (1.24, 1.03 to 1.48), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (1.17, 1.03 to 1.34), ovarian cancer (1.14, 1.03 to 1.27), all cancers combined (1.12, 1.09 to 1.14), breast cancer in postmenopausal women (1.40, 1.31 to 1.49) and colorectal cancer in premenopausal women (1.61, 1.05 to 2.48). In general, the relation between body mass index and mortality was similar to that for incidence. For colorectal cancer, malignant melanoma, breast cancer, and endometrial cancer, the effect of body mass index on risk differed significantly according to menopausal status. CONCLUSIONS: Increasing body mass index is associated with a significant increase in the risk of cancer for 10 out of 17 specific types examined. Among postmenopausal women in the UK, 5% of all cancers (about 6000 annually) are attributable to being overweight or obese. For endometrial cancer and adenocarcinoma of the oesophagus, body mass index represents a major modifiable risk factor; about half of all cases in postmenopausal women are attributable to overweight or obesity.","['Reeves, Gillian K', 'Pirie, Kirstin', 'Beral, Valerie', 'Green, Jane', 'Spencer, Elizabeth', 'Bull, Diana']","['Reeves GK', 'Pirie K', 'Beral V', 'Green J', 'Spencer E', 'Bull D']","['Cancer Epidemiology Unit, University of Oxford, Oxford OX3 7LF. gill.reeves@ceu.ox.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071106,England,BMJ,BMJ (Clinical research ed.),8900488,,IM,"['Age Distribution', 'Alcohol Drinking/mortality', '*Body Mass Index', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Maternal Age', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*mortality', 'Obesity/mortality', 'Parity', 'Pregnancy', 'Smoking/mortality', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'United Kingdom/epidemiology']",2007/11/08 09:00,2007/12/18 09:00,['2007/11/08 09:00'],"['2007/11/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/18 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['bmj.39367.495995.AE [pii]', '10.1136/bmj.39367.495995.AE [doi]']",ppublish,BMJ. 2007 Dec 1;335(7630):1134. doi: 10.1136/bmj.39367.495995.AE.

Although vincristine resistance mechanisms have been extensively characterized in cell lines, their clinical relevance is poorly understood. The aim of the current study was to define clinically relevant mechanisms of vincristine resistance in a panel of childhood ALL xenografts established in immune-deficient (nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient) mice. We also studied two independent xenograft sublines that were selected by in vivo vincristine exposure. In vitro vincristine sensitivity determined by a stromal coculture, murine bone marrow stromal cell line (MS-5), assay, but not methyl-thiazolyl-tetrazolium metabolic activity assay, significantly correlated (P = 0.05) with the length of the patients' first remission. Investigations into mechanisms of resistance revealed no association with steady-state vincristine accumulation or increased activity and/or expression of ATP-binding cassette transporters, although increased intracellular levels of polymerized tubulin significantly correlated with resistance (r = 0.85; P = 0.0019). Two xenograft sublines selected by in vivo vincristine exposure exhibited a 2-fold increase in polymerized tubulin levels compared with the parental subline (P < 0.05), reflecting their in vivo vincristine resistance. In this study, a vincristine-resistant xenograft with high levels of polymerized tubulin was relatively sensitive to the microtubule-polymerizing drug paclitaxel. These results indicate that the balance between polymerized and nonpolymerized tubulin may be an important determinant of response to Vinca alkaloid-based chemotherapy regimens in childhood ALL.","['Ong, Vivienna', 'Liem, Natalia L M', 'Schmid, Michael A', 'Verrills, Nicole M', 'Papa, Rachael A', 'Marshall, Glenn M', 'Mackenzie, Karen L', 'Kavallaris, Maria', 'Lock, Richard B']","['Ong V', 'Liem NL', 'Schmid MA', 'Verrills NM', 'Papa RA', 'Marshall GM', 'Mackenzie KL', 'Kavallaris M', 'Lock RB']","[""Children's Cancer Institute Australia, PO Box 81, High St., Randwick 2031, NSW, Australia.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071106,United States,J Pharmacol Exp Ther,The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics,0376362,"['0 (Polymers)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Microtubules/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Polymers/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Vincristine/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays/*methods']",2007/11/08 09:00,2008/02/20 09:00,['2007/11/08 09:00'],"['2007/11/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/20 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['jpet.107.128926 [pii]', '10.1124/jpet.107.128926 [doi]']",ppublish,J Pharmacol Exp Ther. 2008 Feb;324(2):434-42. doi: 10.1124/jpet.107.128926.

We found that TAB2 physically interacts with Tax and augments Tax-induced NF-kappaB activity. Tax and TAB2 cooperatively activate TAK1 when they are coexpressed. Furthermore, TAK1 activation by Tax requires TAB2 binding as well as ubiquitination of Tax. We also found that the overexpression of TRAF2, 5, or 6 strongly induces Tax ubiquitination. These results suggest that TAB2 may be critically involved in Tax-mediated activation of TAK1 and that NF-kappaB-activating TRAF family proteins are potential cellular E3 ubiquitin ligases toward Tax.","['Yu, Qingsheng', 'Minoda, Yasumasa', 'Yoshida, Ryoko', 'Yoshida, Hideyuki', 'Iha, Hidekatsu', 'Kobayashi, Takashi', 'Yoshimura, Akihiko', 'Takaesu, Giichi']","['Yu Q', 'Minoda Y', 'Yoshida R', 'Yoshida H', 'Iha H', 'Kobayashi T', 'Yoshimura A', 'Takaesu G']","['Division of Molecular and Cellular Immunology, Medical Institute of Bioregulation, Kyushu University, 3-1-1 Maidashi, Higashi-ku, Fukuoka, Fukuoka 812-8582, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071105,United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (TAB2 protein, human)', '0 (tax protein, Human T-lymphotrophic virus 1)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (MAP Kinase Kinase Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (MAP kinase kinase kinase 7)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/*metabolism', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line', 'Gene Products, tax/*metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'MAP Kinase Kinase Kinases/*metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/metabolism']",2007/11/08 09:00,2008/02/13 09:00,['2007/11/08 09:00'],"['2007/10/25 00:00 [received]', '2007/10/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/11/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/13 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-291X(07)02359-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2007.10.172 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2008 Jan 4;365(1):189-94. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2007.10.172.

Neuroblastoma differentiation is linked to the presence of the promyelocytic leukemia (PML) protein. Retinoic acid, a powerful differentiation-inducer in vitro, is a potent agent for the treatment of neuroblastoma. Using two different human neuroblastoma cell lines, SH-SY5Y and LA-N-5, we show here that PML protein leads to the formation of nuclear bodies (PML-NB) after only 1 h of retinoic acid treatment and that this formation is mediated by the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway. Inhibition of protein kinase C also leads to formation of PML-NB via the ERK pathway. Both sumoylation and phosphorylation of PML in an ERK-dependent pathway are also required for formation of PML-NB. Finally, we show that PML-NB formation in neuroblastoma cells is associated with neurite outgrowth. These results support the proposal that the formation of PML-NB is correlated with the differentiation of neuroblastoma cells.","['Delaune, A', 'Corbiere, C', 'Benjelloun, F D', 'Legrand, E', 'Vannier, J P', 'Ripoll, C', 'Vasse, M']","['Delaune A', 'Corbiere C', 'Benjelloun FD', 'Legrand E', 'Vannier JP', 'Ripoll C', 'Vasse M']","['Groupe de recherche MERCI & IHURBM, Faculte de medecine et pharmacie, Rouen, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071106,England,J Neurochem,Journal of neurochemistry,2985190R,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Keratolytic Agents)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Nucleus Structures/*metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Keratolytic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Models, Biological', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Neuroblastoma/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']",2007/11/08 09:00,2008/02/19 09:00,['2007/11/08 09:00'],"['2007/11/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/19 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['JNC5019 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1471-4159.2007.05019.x [doi]']",ppublish,J Neurochem. 2008 Jan;104(1):89-99. doi: 10.1111/j.1471-4159.2007.05019.x.

The present study investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying the differentiation and survival-promoting effects of MT and a peptide modeled after MT, EmtinB. Both MT and EmtinB directly stimulated neurite outgrowth and promoted survival in vitro using primary cultures of cerebellar granule neurons. In addition, expression and surface localization of megalin, a known MT receptor, and the related lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1 (LRP) are demonstrated in cerebellar granule neurons. By means of surface plasmon resonance MT and EmtinB were found to bind to both megalin and LRP. The bindings were abrogated in the presence of receptor-associated protein-1, an antagonist of the low-density lipoprotein receptor family, which also inhibited MT- and EmtinB-induced neurite outgrowth and survival. MT-mediated neurite outgrowth was furthermore inhibited by an anti-megalin serum. EmtinB-mediated inhibition of apoptosis occurred without a reduction of caspase-3 activity, but was associated with reduced expression of the pro-apoptotic B-cell leukemia/lymphoma-2 interacting member of cell death (Bim(S)). Finally, evidence is provided that MT and EmtinB activate extracellular signal-regulated kinase, protein kinase B, and cAMP response element binding protein. Altogether, these results strongly suggest that MT and EmtinB induce their neuronal effects through direct binding to surface receptors belonging to the low-density lipoprotein receptor family, such as megalin and LRP, thereby activating signal transduction pathways resulting in neurite outgrowth and survival.","['Ambjorn, Malene', 'Asmussen, Johanne W', 'Lindstam, Mats', 'Gotfryd, Kamil', 'Jacobsen, Christian', 'Kiselyov, Vladislav V', 'Moestrup, Soren K', 'Penkowa, Milena', 'Bock, Elisabeth', 'Berezin, Vladimir']","['Ambjorn M', 'Asmussen JW', 'Lindstam M', 'Gotfryd K', 'Jacobsen C', 'Kiselyov VV', 'Moestrup SK', 'Penkowa M', 'Bock E', 'Berezin V']","['Protein Laboratory, Institute of Neuroscience and Pharmacology, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071106,England,J Neurochem,Journal of neurochemistry,2985190R,"['0 (EmtinB peptide)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (LDL-Receptor Related Protein-Associated Protein)', '0 (Low Density Lipoprotein Receptor-Related Protein-2)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Receptors, LDL)', '9038-94-2 (Metallothionein)']",IM,"['Analysis of Variance', 'Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cerebellum/cytology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'In Situ Nick-End Labeling/methods', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'LDL-Receptor Related Protein-Associated Protein/metabolism', 'Low Density Lipoprotein Receptor-Related Protein-2/metabolism', 'Metallothionein/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Models, Biological', 'Neurites/drug effects', 'Neurons/*drug effects', 'Peptides/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Protein Binding/drug effects', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Receptors, LDL/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'Surface Plasmon Resonance/methods']",2007/11/08 09:00,2008/02/19 09:00,['2007/11/08 09:00'],"['2007/11/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/19 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['JNC5036 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1471-4159.2007.05036.x [doi]']",ppublish,J Neurochem. 2008 Jan;104(1):21-37. doi: 10.1111/j.1471-4159.2007.05036.x.

We used population-based data from Western Australia to investigate trends in the incidence of childhood ALL between 1960 and 2006. Age-standardized incidence rates (ASRs) and rate ratios (indicating annual percent change) were estimated using Poisson regression. Between 1960 and 2006, the ASR was 3.7 per 100,000 person-years, with an annual percent increase of 0.40% (95% CI: -0.20, 1.00).

For example, the production and efficiency of murine leukemia virus (MLV) are limited by its inherent instability; the half-life of infectivity is 5-8 hours at 37 degrees C. In order to generate a stable MLV, we randomly mutated the virus genome and selected for infectivity after prolonged incubation at 37 degrees C. After seven rounds of incubation and infection, we isolated a pool of MLV variants with double the half-life of wild-type MLV. Remarkably, a single mutation in the viral protease (PR), G119E, was responsible for the enhanced stability. Saturation mutagenesis at residue 119 revealed variants with half-lives of approximately 24 hours at 37 degrees C. Double mutants combining the changes at position 119 of the PR and substitutions in the PR substrate-binding pocket exhibited half-lives of up to approximately 40 hours. MLV variants provided two- to fourfold higher viral titers and exhibited increased stability with various wild-type envelope proteins.

This study was undertaken to correlate the clinical and serologic features of these antibodies to identify predictors of clinical significance. Forty-two consecutive patients with serologically detectable warm-reactive autoantibodies were studied. These patients (21 male, 21 female) had a mean age of 9 years (range: 2 mo to 21 y). Primary diagnoses included autoimmune disorders (14), sickle cell disease (14), viral infection (4), idiopathic autoimmune hemolytic anemia (2), leukemia (2), and other diseases (6). Autoimmune hemolysis, as determined by clinical and laboratory findings, was documented in 24 patients (57%). Serologic studies revealed that all patients demonstrated IgG on their red cells [Direct Antiglobulin Test (DAT) reactivity range: microscopic to 3+]; 17 (40%) also demonstrated complement (DAT reactivity range: microscopic to 2+). There was a correlation between the strength of the DAT for IgG and the presence of complement on the red cells, with both being important predictors of hemolysis.

The widespread use of computed tomography (CT) scans has prompted many to advocate for the incorporation of this test into CLL response criteria. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a retrospective review of 82 CLL patients treated at the Ohio State University (Columbus, OH), we compared CT assessed response using non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) response definitions with NCI-WG response. RESULTS: Responses by NCI-WG criteria included five complete responses (CRs), 32 partial responses (PRs), 21 patients with stable disease (SD), 17 patients with progressive disease (PD), and seven patients not assessable (NA). Responses by NHL-CT criteria included three CRs, 12 unconfirmed CRs (CRus), 16 PRs, 26 with SD, four with PD, and 21 NA. Using NCI-WG criteria, progression-free survival (PFS) was 27.3 months for CR and 11.4 months for PR. With NHL-CT criteria, PFS was 18.4 months for CR, 11.7 months for CRu, and 14.5 months for PR. In multivariate analysis, both NCI-WG and NHL-CT response correlated with PFS (P = .009 and .001, respectively). CONCLUSION: Current NCI-WG CLL response criteria are a significant predictor of PFS in previously treated CLL patients, with no additional benefit from the inclusion of CT scans. Although retrospective, these results highlight the importance of prospective validation of CT scans before routine inclusion in CLL response criteria.","['Blum, Kristie A', 'Young, Donn', 'Broering, Sarah', 'Lucas, Margaret S', 'Fischer, Beth', 'Lin, Thomas S', 'Grever, Michael R', 'Byrd, John C']","['Blum KA', 'Young D', 'Broering S', 'Lucas MS', 'Fischer B', 'Lin TS', 'Grever MR', 'Byrd JC']","['The Ohio State University, Division of Hematology-Oncology, Starling Loving Hall, Room B324, Columbus, OH 43210, USA. kristie.blum@osumc.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071105,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*diagnostic imaging/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'National Cancer Institute (U.S.)', 'Practice Guidelines as Topic', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Radiography', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome', 'United States']",2007/11/07 09:00,2007/12/20 09:00,['2007/11/07 09:00'],"['2007/11/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/20 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['JCO.2007.12.1152 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2007.12.1152 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2007 Dec 10;25(35):5624-9. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2007.12.1152.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients received alemtuzumab (30 mg three times per week, for up to 12 weeks) or chlorambucil (40 mg/m(2) every 28 days, for up to 12 months). The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary end points included overall response rate (ORR), complete response (CR), time to alternative therapy, safety, and overall survival. RESULTS: We randomly assigned 297 patients, 149 to alemtuzumab and 148 to chlorambucil. Alemtuzumab had superior PFS, with a 42% reduction in risk of progression or death (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.58; P = .0001), and a median time to alternative treatment of 23.3 versus 14.7 months for chlorambucil (HR = 0.54; P = .0001). The ORR was 83% with alemtuzumab (24% CR) versus 55% with chlorambucil (2% CR); differences in ORR and CR were highly statistically significant (P < .0001). Elimination of minimal residual disease occurred in 11 of 36 complete responders to alemtuzumab versus none to chlorambucil. Adverse events profiles were similar, except for more infusion-related and cytomegalovirus (CMV) events with alemtuzumab and more nausea and vomiting with chlorambucil. CMV events had no apparent impact on efficacy.

These comments are intended to demonstrate the use of the Kahn review as a launching pad for an in-depth analysis of the several related areas that must be fully explored to understand benzene-related diseases. The accumulated evidence demonstrates that benzene-induced bone marrow damage results from the production of hematotoxins that are metabolic products of benzene metabolism. The metabolism of benzene is described with respect to the formation benzene metabolites with emphasis on phenol and hydroquinone, which are the major metabolites, the significance of the formation of glutathione conjugates, the activity of NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase (NQO1), and the ring opening products. Results are shown suggesting that oxidative stress induced by benzene metabolites is likely to be a significant factor in damaging DNA in bone marrow cells. Although a variety of effects on bone marrow can be demonstrated it is not yet clear which metabolites are most important in either benzene-induced aplastic anemia or leukemia. Benzene metabolism alone is insufficient to fully describe benzene toxicity. The impact of benzene metabolites on bone marrow cells must be fully explored to determine how benzene exposure can result in decreased viability or genetic toxicity to cells in the bone marrow.","['Snyder, R']",['Snyder R'],"['Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, Piscataway, NJ 08854, USA. rsnyder@eohsi.rutgers.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Comment']",,England,Hum Exp Toxicol,Human & experimental toxicology,9004560,"['0 (Environmental Pollutants)', '0 (Hydroquinones)', '0 (Mutagens)', '339NCG44TV (Phenol)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 1.6.5.2 (NAD(P)H Dehydrogenase (Quinone))', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)', 'XV74C1N1AE (hydroquinone)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Benzene/metabolism/*toxicity', 'Biotransformation', 'Bone Marrow/*drug effects/enzymology/metabolism', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/chemically induced', 'Chromosome Aberrations/chemically induced', 'DNA/drug effects', 'DNA Damage', 'Environmental Pollutants/metabolism/*toxicity', 'Glutathione/metabolism', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/chemically induced', 'Humans', 'Hydroquinones/toxicity', 'Mutagens/metabolism/*toxicity', 'NAD(P)H Dehydrogenase (Quinone)/metabolism', 'Oxidative Stress/drug effects', 'Phenol/toxicity', 'Risk Assessment', '*Toxicity Tests']",2007/11/07 09:00,2008/02/01 09:00,['2007/11/07 09:00'],"['2007/11/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/01 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['26/9/687 [pii]', '10.1177/0960327107083975 [doi]']",ppublish,Hum Exp Toxicol. 2007 Sep;26(9):687-96. doi: 10.1177/0960327107083975.,,,,,,,,,,,['Hum Exp Toxicol. 2007 Sep;26(9):677-85.

Strong linkage disequilibrium was noted among loci -2578, -460 and +405, but not with +936. Accordingly, four haplotypes were generated based on the genotypes of -2578, -460 and +405 as follows: CTC (40.2%), CTG (35.0%), ACG (22.0%) and ATC (1.2%). The LFS and event-free survival (EFS) inversely correlated with CTG haplotype (P = 0.03 for LFS; P = 0.05 for EFS). We scored the VEGFA polymorphism marker based on +936 C>T genotype and CTG haplotype for -2578, -460 and +405, which demonstrated a good correlation with the treatment outcomes: LFS (P = 0.01), EFS (P = 0.03) and overall survival (P = 0.01). The VEGFA +936 C>T genotype and CTG haplotype seemed to have an additive effect to predict the prognosis in AML patients.","['Kim, Dong Hwan', 'Lee, Nan Young', 'Lee, Myung-Hoon', 'Sohn, Sang Kyun', 'Do, Young Rok', 'Park, Jae Yong']","['Kim DH', 'Lee NY', 'Lee MH', 'Sohn SK', 'Do YR', 'Park JY']","['Department of Haematology/Oncology, Kyungpook National University Hospital, Daegu, Korea. drkiim@medimail.co.kr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071103,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (VEGFA protein, human)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*genetics/mortality', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/*genetics']",2007/11/07 09:00,2008/04/24 09:00,['2007/11/07 09:00'],"['2007/11/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/24 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['BJH6887 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2007.06887.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2008 Jan;140(1):71-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2007.06887.x.

The numbers of HIV-1/HTLV-1 coinfections in South America and Africa are increasing, as well as HIV-1/HTLV-2 coinfections in the USA and Europe. Coinfections by either HTLV-1 or HTLV-2 and HIV-1 frequently occur in persons with a history of injection drug use. Since HTLV-1 preferentially infects CD4+ T-cells and HTLV-2 has a tropism for CD8+ T-cells, the influence of coinfection on HIV-1 disease progression may be different. The effect of HIV-1/HTLV-1 coinfection on HIV-I pathogenesis is controversial as soluble factors produced by HTLV-1 infected cells can either enhance or suppress HIV-1 infection. In HTLV-1/HIV-1 coinfected patients, upregulation of HIV-1 expression was attributed to strong activation of cytokines that promoted HIV infection. The introduction of HAART has dramatically reduced HIV-1 morbidity and mortality, but has given rise to an increased number of inflammatory syndromes. While HAART is successful for controlling HIV disease, it has little impact on HTLV-1/2 genome expression. The consequence of coinfection, even with HAART, may well be the reported increase in neurologic disease. Several epidemiologic and in vitro studies of the influence of HTLV infection on HIV-1 related AIDS progression suggest that HTLV-1 infection can promote HIV-1 replication and accelerate the clinical progression to AIDS. However, other studies have not confirmed these observations. The differences in study outcomes could be related to the occurrence of different HIV-1 phenotypes in clinical disease. In contrast, evidence points to a confirmed protective role of HTLV-2 that is manifested as improved survival and delayed progression to AIDS. The protective effect may be the result of maintaining normal-range levels of CD4 and CD8 counts, lowering HIV replication, and immune activation. As a corollary, the number of long-term nonprogressors for AIDS in the HIV-1/HTLV-2 coinfected group was found to be significantly higher than in HIV-1 monoinfected cases. Investigations of the natural factors induced by HTLV-2 that influence HIV-1 replication show that CCL3L1 (an isoform of CCL3) is preferentially induced in HTLV-2 exposed seronegative HIV individuals and in long-term nonprogressor HTLV-2/HIV-1 coinfected persons. The CCL3L 1 inhibits HIV replication and thus acts as a potent effector against both HIV infection and disease progression. As a complement to upregulation of CCL3L1, other chemokines and cytokines induced by HTLV-2 may contribute to induction of the Th1 response against invading pathogens, in contrast to the dominant Th2 response that appears to favor HIV infection. The number of individuals with either single HIV-1 or HTLV-2 infection, in a cohort of Italian intravenous drug users monitored for 20 years, decreased significantly over time. However, the magnitude of HTLV-2 decrease was significantly less than that of HIV-1, pointing to the need for increased attention to, and control of, HTLV infection. In conclusion, the long-term effects of HIV and HTLV coinfections are poorly understood and the mechanisms of dysregulation of cellular biosynthesis by HTLV that impact HIV disease progression remain elusive.","['Casoli, Claudio', 'Pilotti, Elisabetta', 'Bertazzoni, Umberto']","['Casoli C', 'Pilotti E', 'Bertazzoni U']","['Department of Clinical Medicine, Nephrology and Health Sciences, University of Parma, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,Spain,AIDS Rev,AIDS reviews,101134876,"['0 (CCL3L1 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokines, CC)']",IM,"['*Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Antiretroviral Therapy, Highly Active', 'Chemokines, CC/blood/*metabolism', 'Disease Progression', 'HIV Infections/*complications/virology', 'HIV-1/isolation & purification/*physiology', 'HTLV-I Infections/*complications/virology', 'HTLV-II Infections/*complications/virology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/isolation & purification/physiology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 2/isolation & purification/physiology', 'Humans', 'Substance Abuse, Intravenous/virology']",2007/11/07 09:00,2007/12/18 09:00,['2007/11/07 09:00'],"['2007/11/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/18 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/07 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,AIDS Rev. 2007 Jul-Sep;9(3):140-9.,,,,,,,,149,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we examined the antitumor effects of MK4 on cholangiocellular carcinoma (CCC) cell lines and its mechanism of action using the HL-60 leukemia cell line that exerts MK4-induced cell growth inhibition via apoptosis induction and cell cycle arrest as a control. MK4 exerted dose-dependent antitumor effects on all three types of CCC cell lines. However, apoptosis occurred in a smaller percentage of cells and there was less cell cycle arrest compared with other cancer cell lines studied previously, which suggested slight MK4-induced cell growth inhibition via apoptosis induction and cell cycle arrest. On the contrary, histopathological fidings showed a large number of cells containing vacuoles in their cytoplasm, and electron microscopic findings showed a large number of cytoplasmic autophagosomes and autolysosomes. These findings suggested evidence of autophagy-related cell death. Fluorescence microscopy following acridine orange staining revealed an increase in the number of cytoplasmic acidic vesicular organelles characteristic of autophagy. Moreover, there were few cells forming autophagic vesicles in the control group, while the percentage of cells containing vacuoles in the MK4-treated group increased with the duration of culture. These results suggested that, unlike in leukemia, gastric cancer, HCC, and other cancer cells, the antitumor effects of MK4 on CCC cells are induced via autophagy formation.","['Enomoto, Masanobu', 'Tsuchida, Akihiko', 'Miyazawa, Keisuke', 'Yokoyama, Tomohisa', 'Kawakita, Hideaki', 'Tokita, Hiromi', 'Naito, Munekazu', 'Itoh, Masahiro', 'Ohyashiki, Kazuma', 'Aoki, Tatsuya']","['Enomoto M', 'Tsuchida A', 'Miyazawa K', 'Yokoyama T', 'Kawakita H', 'Tokita H', 'Naito M', 'Itoh M', 'Ohyashiki K', 'Aoki T']","['Third Department of Surgery, Tokyo Medical University, Tokyo 160-0023, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Greece,Int J Mol Med,International journal of molecular medicine,9810955,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Vitamins)', '11032-49-8 (Vitamin K 2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/physiology', 'Autophagy/*physiology', 'Bile Duct Neoplasms/metabolism/*pathology', 'Bile Ducts, Intrahepatic/metabolism/*pathology', 'Cell Cycle/physiology', 'Cell Shape', 'Cholangiocarcinoma/metabolism/*pathology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Vitamin K 2/analogs & derivatives/*metabolism', 'Vitamins/*metabolism']",2007/11/06 09:00,2008/04/19 09:00,['2007/11/06 09:00'],"['2007/11/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/19 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/06 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Int J Mol Med. 2007 Dec;20(6):801-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, at lower concentrations proliferation increased for a subset of patients. This divergence was also observed in the presence of all-trans retinoic acid, theophylline and decitabine, and in cocultures with bone marrow stromal cells.

Based on the basal expression of 100 genes the patients with growth enhancement at intermediate HDAC inhibitor concentrations and those without this response were clustered into two mutually exclusive groups.

In addition, VD3 or EB1089 displayed a high disposal of oxidant features and the ability to cause release of reactive oxygen species (ROS). We attempted to enhance HL60 cell differentiation and to limit ROS generation, by the association of deltanoids with doxorubicin and the antioxidants catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and N-acetyl cystein (NAC). Differentiation of HL60 cells into monocytic lineage was studied by expression of mRNA, protein CD14 and functional differentiation by the nitroblue tetrazolium assay. The 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (H2-DCFDA) dye allowed to evaluate in situ ROS generation. When associated with 0.1 nM EB1089, 15 nM doxorubicin induced an increase of differentiated cell percentage from 29% to 87% and did not affect VD3-treated cells. The association with doxorubicin also induced a significant increase of ROS release (p<0.05) versus VD3 and EB1089-treated cells. These results correspond to additivity of individual effects of doxorubicin and deltanoids. Antioxidant agents (10 nM NAC, 50 U/ml SOD or 2000 U/ml CAT) were associated with 10 nM VD3 or 1 nM EB1089 for 72 h. Compared to VD3 and EB1089 treatments, associations with antioxidants induced a slight increase of differentiated cells and a significant increase of CD14 mRNA. The highest differentiation effect occurred in the case of the EB1089-NAC association. Antioxidants induced a decrease (p<0.05) in ROS release generated by VD3 or EB1089 near the level of untreated cells. Thus, antioxidant agents demonstrated a protective effect against VD3 and EB1089 oxidative cytotoxicity and an enhancement of the monocyte differentiation.

We divided patients into two groups (good prognosis group, GPG and poor prognosis group, PPG) based on differences in the individual reactions to treatment. Gene expression profiles were analyzed using microarray. Among genes up-regulated at least two-fold and down-regulated at least 0.5-fold in HL-60, we chose three up-regulated genes (PPP2CA, ME3, and CCDN2) and three down-regulated genes (GLO1, ANXA2, and BMI1) and confirmed the expression of these six genes by RT-PCR. We created a leukemia-specific subclass microarray, based on the gene expression profiles. Clinical samples from the bone marrow of four patients were hybridized on this microarray. Among the genes selected by the microarray technology, NB4, silenced TRIB3 and overexpressed XRN2 were not differentiated in spite of treatment with ATRA. This indicates that XRN2 and TRIB3 play an important role in cell differentiation.

Consequently, there is a pressing need to develop novel treatment protocols for this high-risk patient group. The present study was performed to evaluate Hsp90 inhibition as a possible therapeutic approach for such patients. Primary CLL cells of defined ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM)/p53 status were incubated with the Hsp90 inhibitor geldanamycin (GA) and analysed by western blotting for the expression of p53, p21, MDM2 and Akt. GA downregulated overexpressed mutant p53 protein (an oncogene) and upregulated wild-type (wt) p53 (a tumour suppressor). The upregulation of wt p53 by GA was independent of ATM and was accompanied by downregulation of Akt and the active form of MDM2, indicating a possible mechanism. GA also produced a p53/ATM-independent increase in the levels of p21-a potent inducer of cell-cycle arrest. In-vitro cytotoxicity studies showed that GA killed cultured CLL cells in a dose- and time-dependent fashion irrespective of their p53/ATM status and more effectively than normal blood mononuclear cells. In summary, our findings reveal important consequences of inhibiting Hsp90 in CLL cells and strongly support the therapeutic evaluation of Hsp90 inhibitors in poor-prognosis patients with p53 defects.","['Lin, K', 'Rockliffe, N', 'Johnson, G G', 'Sherrington, P D', 'Pettitt, A R']","['Lin K', 'Rockliffe N', 'Johnson GG', 'Sherrington PD', 'Pettitt AR']","['Department of Haematology, Royal Liverpool and Broadgreen University Hospitals Trust, Liverpool, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071105,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Benzoquinones)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Lactams, Macrocyclic)', '0 (Mutant Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (MDM2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (ATM protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'Z3K3VJ16KU (geldanamycin)']",IM,"['Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins', 'Benzoquinones/toxicity', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/*metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects', 'HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Lactams, Macrocyclic/toxicity', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mutant Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*metabolism']",2007/11/06 09:00,2008/05/02 09:00,['2007/11/06 09:00'],"['2007/11/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/02 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['1210893 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.onc.1210893 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2008 Apr 10;27(17):2445-55. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1210893.

Most of the menaquinone series are synthesized by microorganisms, but we have reported that MK-4 is usual in being synthesized by the conversion of orally ingested VK(1) or MK-n in the major tissues of germfree rats and mice which lack their intestinal microflora. This result led us to deny 1960's Martius' hypothesis that described the participation of bacterial enzyme of the intestinal flora to this conversion. VK acts as a cofactor in the posttranslational synthesis of gamma-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla) from glutamic acid (Glu) residues in the nascent Gla-protein molecule. Therefore, VK is essential for blood coagulation (various clotting factors) and bone structure (as osteocalcin [OC = BGP] and matrix Gla-protein [MGP] in mammals. In addition to the liver, VK is found in the bone, brain, heart, testis, kidney, pancreas and salivary glands mainly as MK-4, and it has been reported that MK-4 itself has specific biological activities in these tissues beside Gla-protein formation. However, the physiological role of MK-4 in these organs has not been fully understood yet. Recently MK-4 has been attracted the attention of researchers due to its activities such as apoptotic activity on the osteoclast cells and leukemia cells, SXR/PXR ligand, and so on. We further review the potent important physiological role of MK-4 in the bone as well as other major tissues.","['Komai, Michio', 'Shirakawa, Hitoshi']","['Komai M', 'Shirakawa H']","['Tohoku University, Graduate School of Agricultural Science, Department of Science of Food Function and Health, Laboratory of Nutrition.']",['jpn'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Japan,Clin Calcium,Clinical calcium,9433326,"['0 (Ligands)', '0 (Pregnane X Receptor)', '0 (Receptors, Steroid)', '104982-03-8 (Osteocalcin)', '11032-49-8 (Vitamin K 2)', '12001-79-5 (Vitamin K)', '27Y876D139 (menatetrenone)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Blood Coagulation', 'Bone and Bones/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Intestinal Absorption', 'Ligands', 'Mice', 'Osteocalcin/metabolism', 'Osteoclasts/cytology', 'Pregnane X Receptor', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Steroid', 'Vitamin K/*analogs & derivatives/*metabolism/physiology', 'Vitamin K 2/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism']",2007/11/06 09:00,2008/02/22 09:00,['2007/11/06 09:00'],"['2007/11/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/22 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['071116631672 [pii]', 'CliCa071116631672 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Calcium. 2007 Nov;17(11):1663-72. doi: CliCa071116631672.,,,,,,,,23,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study shows that expansion of a mutant Ph-positive clone that responds initially to a second generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor may be due either to late acquisition of a second mutation in the originally mutated clone, such as the T315I, or to acquisition of a completely new mutant clone, such as F317L.","['Khorashad, Jamshid S', 'Milojkovic, Dragana', 'Mehta, Puja', 'Anand, Mona', 'Ghorashian, Sara', 'Reid, Alistair G', 'De Melo, Valeria', 'Babb, Anna', 'de Lavallade, Hugues', 'Olavarria, Eduardo', 'Marin, David', 'Goldman, John M', 'Apperley, Jane F', 'Kaeda, Jaspal S']","['Khorashad JS', 'Milojkovic D', 'Mehta P', 'Anand M', 'Ghorashian S', 'Reid AG', 'De Melo V', 'Babb A', 'de Lavallade H', 'Olavarria E', 'Marin D', 'Goldman JM', 'Apperley JF', 'Kaeda JS']","['Department of Haematology, Hammersmith Hospitals Trust and Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071102,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Dasatinib', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', '*Mutation', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinases/*genetics', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Thiazoles/*therapeutic use', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Treatment Failure']",2007/11/06 09:00,2008/05/22 09:00,['2007/11/06 09:00'],"['2007/11/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/22 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)44638-5 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2007-06-096396 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2008 Feb 15;111(4):2378-81. doi: 10.1182/blood-2007-06-096396.

Nevertheless, a variety of functions and some new enzymatic activities of chitinases have been found in recent years.

Expression of TYchi gene in T. kirilowii plants was induced by F. oxysporum, an important cucurbitaceous fungal pathogen, which indicated that TYchi involved in the pathogen-induced plant defense reaction. In addition to its chitin-hydrolytic activity, the recombinant TYchi protein also had RNA N-glycosidase property. In cell-free rabbit reticulocyte lysate system, TYchi inhibited protein synthesis with an IC50 of approximate 5 nM. TYchi also exhibited efficient cytotoxicities to leukemia U937 and choriocarcinoma JAR cells with IC50 about 54 microg ml(-1) and 73 microg ml(-1), respectively. Structure analyses indicated that the putative domain of TYchi is highly similar to the well known active domain of the N-glycosidase trichosanthin (TCS).

T cells play an important role in tumor immunity and two signals are traditionally thought to be required to activate naive T cells; signal one through the major histocompatibility:antigen:T-cell receptor complex and signal two through costimulation. Many tumor associated antigens have been identified in AML suggesting it may be possible to target the immune system of AML patients; however AML develops due to tumour and immune editing, two systems by which AML cells can escape immune surveillance. By genetically modifying AML cells to express costimulatory molecules and/or cytokines, it has been possible to transform AML cells into antigen presenting cells and this has the potential to re-activate the immune system in patients.

The objective of the study was to estimate underlying diseases and potential diagnostic relevance of high cobalamin blood levels in internal medicine. METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted, including in-patients from December 2005 to July 2006 presenting high cobalamin blood levels, as determined with our laboratory normal values (200-950 pg/mL). RESULTS: High cobalamin blood level is not unusual (18.5% of all dosages) and, most of time, it is associated with one or several diseases, among which acute and chronic liver diseases (often of alcoholic origin), various neoplasias, malignant hemopathies (myelodysplasia, myeloproliferative diseases, multiple myeloma), renal insufficiency and transient hematologic abnormalities (neutrophilic hyperleucocytosis, hypereosinophilia). Vitamin B12 supplementation and chronic myeloid leukemia represent less than 5% of all hypervitaminemia. There is no correlation between the level of cobalamin blood level and the number of underlying diseases for each patients. However, very high cobalamin blood levels (>1275 pg/mL) are significantly associated to malignant hemopathies (p<0.05).

This study aimed to determine if flow cytometric analysis add more objective and standardized information on the cellularity and morphology of lymphoma cells to conventional cytology. The typical immunophenotype of different lymphoma subtypes was assessed and leukocyte marker expression was evaluated to determine which antigens were more frequently over- or under-expressed in these lymphoma subtypes. Fifty FNA lymph node samples were evaluated from canine lymphomas. Thirty-one samples were identified to be of B-cell origin, sixteen were identified to be of T/NK-cell origin and three cases were classified as acute lymphoblastic leukaemia with lymph nodes involvement. The most common B-cell lymphoma subtypes were centroblastic lymphomas, whereas three cases were atypical and classified as B-large cell pleomorphic lymphomas. Among the T/NK lymphomas, small clear cells, large and small pleomorphic mixed cells, large granular lymphocytic cells and small pleomorphic cells were identified. Aberrant phenotypes and/or antigen under/over regulation was identified in thirty out of forty-seven lymphoma cases (64%; 18/31 B-cell=58% and 12/16 T-cell=75%). In B-cell lymphomas the most frequent finding was the diminished expression of CD79a (45%). CD34 expression was also observed in four cases (13%). Among T-cell lymphomas the prevalent unusual phenotype was the under-expression or absence of CD45 (25%). These findings reveal flow cytometry may be useful in confirming the diagnosis of lymphoma, as the technique allows one to add useful information about morphology of the neoplastic cells and identify antigenic markers and aberrant phenotypes.","['Gelain, M E', 'Mazzilli, M', 'Riondato, F', 'Marconato, L', 'Comazzi, S']","['Gelain ME', 'Mazzilli M', 'Riondato F', 'Marconato L', 'Comazzi S']","['Department of Veterinary Pathology, Hygiene and Health, University of Milan, via Celoria 10, Milan 20133, Italy. mariaelena.gelain@unimi.it']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20071002,Netherlands,Vet Immunol Immunopathol,Veterinary immunology and immunopathology,8002006,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD/genetics/immunology', 'Biopsy, Fine-Needle/veterinary', 'DNA, Neoplasm/chemistry/genetics', 'Dog Diseases/diagnosis/*immunology', 'Dogs', 'Flow Cytometry/methods/*veterinary', 'Gene Rearrangement/immunology', 'Immunophenotyping/methods/veterinary', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/diagnosis/immunology/*veterinary', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/diagnosis/immunology/*veterinary', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/veterinary']",2007/11/06 09:00,2008/05/17 09:00,['2007/11/06 09:00'],"['2007/04/19 00:00 [received]', '2007/09/21 00:00 [revised]', '2007/09/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/11/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/17 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0165-2427(07)00348-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.vetimm.2007.09.018 [doi]']",ppublish,Vet Immunol Immunopathol. 2008 Feb 15;121(3-4):179-88. doi: 10.1016/j.vetimm.2007.09.018.

Here, we show that iNOS downregulation is caspase-dependent and thus can be considered as one of the effector mechanisms of apoptosis, but not a primary triggering event induced by flavopiridol.

Recipients exhibited immune tolerance towards donor antigens with a follow-up of more than 2 decades. In leukemia patients undergoing supralethal radio- and chemotherapy, T cell-depleted transplants are vigorously rejected by residual host T cells; this barrier was first overcome in 1993 by the use of megadose stem cell transplants. This clinical observation can be explained, in part, by the demonstration that cells within the CD34 compartment, as well as their immediate early myeloid progeny, are endowed with veto activity. Engraftment of mismatched hematopoietic stem cells following reduced intensity conditioning, still represents a major challenge. Progress made recently in murine studies by different approaches including the use of new co-stimulatory blockade agents, as well as by tolerance inducing cells such as anti-3rd party veto CTLs, NK T cells, and T regulatory cells, suggests several promising modalities for clinical translation.","['Reisner, Yair', 'Martelli, Massimo F']","['Reisner Y', 'Martelli MF']","['Weizmann Institute of Science, Department of Immunology, POB 26, Rehovot 76100, Israel. yair.Reisner@weizmann.ac.il']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20071105,United States,Blood Cells Mol Dis,"Blood cells, molecules & diseases",9509932,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods/*trends', 'Humans', 'Immune Tolerance', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Organ Transplantation/*trends', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/immunology', '*Transplantation Immunology']",2007/11/06 09:00,2008/02/27 09:00,['2007/11/06 09:00'],"['2007/06/22 00:00 [received]', '2007/06/30 00:00 [revised]', '2007/06/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/11/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/27 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1079-9796(07)00147-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bcmd.2007.06.030 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Cells Mol Dis. 2008 Jan-Feb;40(1):1-7. doi: 10.1016/j.bcmd.2007.06.030.

METHODS: Patients (1376) up to 18 years of age with first relapse of non-B-cell ALL were treated and achieved a 2nd complete remission (CR). The treatment followed trial protocol in five consecutive multicentre trials of the ALL-REZ BFM Study Group between March 1983 and December 2001. The incidence of SMN was analysed, correlated with clinical and therapeutic parameters, and compared to the age-specific incidence rates of cancers as cited in German cancer registries. RESULTS: Out of the 1376 patients 21 were diagnosed with SMN including non-lymphoblastic leukaemia/myelodysplastic syndrome (n=6), osteo-/Ewing's-/fibroblastic sarcoma (n=4), B-cell ALL/lymphoma (n=2), thyroid carcinoma (n=2), basal cell carcinoma, adeno carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, meningioma, malignant histiocytosis, glioblastoma and anaplastic astrocytoma (n=1 each). The overall cumulative risk of SMN at 15 years (median follow-up of 13.1 years) was 1.26%+/-0.38% (SE). SMN was found to be significantly associated with stem cell transplantation (SCT), and high cumulative doses of cranial irradiation, etoposide and cyclophosphamide. In multivariate analysis etoposide (VP16) and cyclophophamide (CY) were found to be independently associated with SMN (p=0.047 and 0.002). Compared to the incidence of neoplasm in the age-matched population, there was a 10-fold increase of neoplasia. CONCLUSIONS: Despite repeated exposure to intense frontline and relapse treatment (including multiagent chemotherapy, cranial irradiation and stem cell transplantation in some patients) the cumulative incidence of SMN was unexpectedly low, though significantly higher than in the general age-matched population. The association of SMN to SCT seemed to be a secondary effect at least partially mediated by exposure to high doses of VP16 and CY given for conditioning therapy.","['Borgmann, Anja', 'Zinn, Christina', 'Hartmann, Reinhard', 'Herold, Ralf', 'Kaatsch, Peter', 'Escherich, Gabriele', 'Moricke, Anja', 'Henze, Gunter', 'von Stackelberg, Arend']","['Borgmann A', 'Zinn C', 'Hartmann R', 'Herold R', 'Kaatsch P', 'Escherich G', 'Moricke A', 'Henze G', 'von Stackelberg A']","['Charite Universitatsmedizin Berlin, OHC, Klinik fur Padiatrie m.S.

It encodes a typical transcription factor with four C(2)-H(2) zinc fingers in the C-terminus. However WT1 is surprisingly complex at multiple levels: it is involved in the development of several organ systems; and is both a tumour suppressor and oncogene. Here we review evidence that has accumulated over the past decade to suggest that as well as binding DNA, WT1 also binds mRNA targets via its zinc fingers and interacts with several splice factors. WT1's first reported post-transcriptional function is also reviewed. WT1's complex roles in development and disease now need to be understood in terms of both DNA and mRNA targets.","['Morrison, Avril A', 'Viney, Rebecca L', 'Ladomery, Michael R']","['Morrison AA', 'Viney RL', 'Ladomery MR']","['Centre for Research in Biomedicine, Faculty of Health and Life Sciences, University of the West of England, Coldharbour Lane, Bristol BS16 1QY, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20071014,Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Ribonucleoproteins)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)', '0 (messenger ribonucleoprotein)']",IM,"['Alternative Splicing', 'Animals', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Models, Biological', 'Protein Binding', '*RNA Processing, Post-Transcriptional', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Ribonucleoproteins/chemistry', 'WT1 Proteins/*physiology', 'Zinc Fingers/physiology']",2007/11/06 09:00,2008/02/19 09:00,['2007/11/06 09:00'],"['2007/07/03 00:00 [received]', '2007/09/28 00:00 [revised]', '2007/10/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/11/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/19 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0304-419X(07)00042-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbcan.2007.10.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 2008 Jan;1785(1):55-62. doi: 10.1016/j.bbcan.2007.10.002.

Central to this has been the determination that the tyrosine kinase function of BCR-ABL is mainly responsible for its transforming potential, and can be targeted with small molecule inhibitors, such as imatinib mesylate (Gleevec, STI-571). Despite this apparent success, the development of clinical resistance to imatinib therapy, and the inability of imatinib to eradicate BCR-ABL-positive malignant hematopoietic progenitors demand detailed investigations of additional effector pathways that can be targeted for CML treatment. The promotion of cellular survival via the suppression of apoptotic pathways is a fundamental characteristic of tumor cells that enables resistance to anti-cancer therapies. As substrates of survival kinases such as Akt, the FoxO family of transcription factors, particularly FoxO3a, has emerged as playing an important role in the cell cycle arrest and apoptosis of hematopoietic cells. This review will discuss our current understanding of BCR-ABL signaling with a focus on apoptotic suppressive mechanisms and alternative approaches to CML therapy, as well as the potential for FoxO transcription factors as novel therapeutic targets.","['Jagani, Zainab', 'Singh, Amrik', 'Khosravi-Far, Roya']","['Jagani Z', 'Singh A', 'Khosravi-Far R']","['Department of Pathology, Harvard Medical School and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",20071016,Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (FOXO3 protein, human)', '0 (Forkhead Box Protein O3)', '0 (Forkhead Transcription Factors)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzamides', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Forkhead Box Protein O3', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors/*physiology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/pathology', 'Models, Biological', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction']",2007/11/06 09:00,2008/02/19 09:00,['2007/11/06 09:00'],"['2007/08/08 00:00 [received]', '2007/10/04 00:00 [revised]', '2007/10/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/11/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/19 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0304-419X(07)00044-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbcan.2007.10.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 2008 Jan;1785(1):63-84. doi: 10.1016/j.bbcan.2007.10.003.

The morphological aspects of eupalinin A-treated cells evaluated by Hoechst 33342 nuclear staining indicated cell death, only a small part of which showed a typical apoptosis with nuclear fragmentation and condensation. To determine what type of cell death is caused by eupalinin A, we examined the contribution of caspases, Bcl-2 family proteins, MAP kinase, and PI3K/Akt, and mitochondrial membrane potential to this cell death. As a result, most part of the cell death was not associated with apoptosis because of caspase independence and no death factor released from mitochondria. Electron microscopic study indicated a characteristic finding of autophagy such as the formation of autophagosomes. Furthermore, the level of microctubule-associated-protein light chain 3 (LC3) II protein and monodancylcanaverin (MDC) incorporation were gradually increased with reduction of mitochondrial membrane potential by the accumulation of intracellular ROS after eupalinin A treatment. From these results, we can conclude that eupalinin A-induced cell death was mainly due to autophagy, which was initiated by increased ROS, resulting in the perturbation of mitochondrial membrane potential. Since the class III PI3K inhibitor such as 3-MA or LY294002 did not inhibit the eupalinin A-induced type II programmed cell death (PCD II), it was suggested that the PCD II was executed by Beclin-1 independent pathway of damage-induced mitochondrial autophagy (mitophagy).","['Itoh, Tomohiro', 'Ito, Yuko', 'Ohguchi, Kenji', 'Ohyama, Masayoshi', 'Iinuma, Munekazu', 'Otsuki, Yoshinori', 'Nozawa, Yoshinori', 'Akao, Yukihiro']","['Itoh T', 'Ito Y', 'Ohguchi K', 'Ohyama M', 'Iinuma M', 'Otsuki Y', 'Nozawa Y', 'Akao Y']","['Gifu International Institute of Biotechnology, 1-1 Naka-Fudogaoka, Kakamigahara, Gifu 504-0838, Japan. titoh@giib.or.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20071017,England,Bioorg Med Chem,Bioorganic & medicinal chemistry,9413298,"['0 (Lactones)', '0 (Sesquiterpenes)', '0 (Terpenes)', '0 (eupalinin A)', '37297-20-4 (phytoalexins)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Autophagy/drug effects', 'Eupatorium/*chemistry', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Lactones/chemistry/*isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Molecular Structure', 'Plants, Medicinal/*chemistry', 'Sesquiterpenes/chemistry/*isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Terpenes/chemistry/*isolation & purification/*pharmacology']",2007/11/06 09:00,2008/02/21 09:00,['2007/11/06 09:00'],"['2007/08/10 00:00 [received]', '2007/10/10 00:00 [revised]', '2007/10/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/11/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/21 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0968-0896(07)00903-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bmc.2007.10.033 [doi]']",ppublish,Bioorg Med Chem. 2008 Jan 15;16(2):721-31. doi: 10.1016/j.bmc.2007.10.033.

We examined members of this family for their expression and activity in hair follicles. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction using mRNA derived from microdissected, anagen-stage human hair follicles and comparison to non-follicular skin epithelium revealed higher levels of IL-6 (15.5-fold) and oncostatin M (OSM, 3.4-fold) in hair follicles. In contrast, expression of all mRNAs coding for IL-6 cytokine family receptors was reduced. Immunohistology suggested expression of OSM, gp130, leukaemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFr) and IL-11r in the hair follicle root sheaths and dermal papilla, while IL-11, IL-6r and OSMr were expressed in root sheaths alone. IL-6 was expressed in the dermal papilla while cardiotrophin-1 (CT-1) and LIF were not observed. OSM and to a lesser extent CT-1 exhibited a dose-dependent growth inhibition capacity on human hair follicles in vitro. OSM and CT-1 incubated with agarose beads and injected subcutaneously at 1 mug per mouse into telogen skin of 65-day-old mice revealed no capacity to induce anagen hair growth. In contrast, injection of 65-day-old mice in which anagen had been induced by hair plucking revealed a moderate hair growth inhibitory capacity for OSM, but no significant effect for CT-1. The data identify OSM as a modulator of hair follicle growth and suggest other family members may also have some degree of hair growth inhibitory effect. In principle, increased expression of some IL-6 cytokine family members in cutaneous inflammation might contribute to the promotion of hair loss.","['Yu, Mei', 'Kissling, Sabine', 'Freyschmidt-Paul, Pia', 'Hoffmann, Rolf', 'Shapiro, Jerry', 'McElwee, Kevin J']","['Yu M', 'Kissling S', 'Freyschmidt-Paul P', 'Hoffmann R', 'Shapiro J', 'McElwee KJ']","['Department of Dermatology and Skin Science, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071102,Denmark,Exp Dermatol,Experimental dermatology,9301549,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '106956-32-5 (Oncostatin M)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)', 'AJ7U77BR8I (cardiotrophin 1)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Alopecia/metabolism/physiopathology', 'Animals', 'Cell Cycle/physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130/metabolism', 'Cytokines/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Hair Follicle/*growth & development/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/*metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Middle Aged', 'Oncostatin M/*metabolism', 'Skin/cytology/metabolism']",2007/11/06 09:00,2008/02/15 09:00,['2007/11/06 09:00'],"['2007/11/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/15 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['EXD643 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0625.2007.00643.x [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Dermatol. 2008 Jan;17(1):12-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0625.2007.00643.x.

Hematopoiesis is a series of cellular processes whereby short-lived mature blood cells are continuously replenished from a pool of rare pluripotential hematopoietic stem cells, in a highly orchestrated process. Aberrances in this intricate process may lead to a malignancy of essential blood-forming organs, causing diseases such as leukemia, aplastic anemia, lymphoma, myelodysplasia and myeloproliferative disorders. Embryonic stem cells show great potential and it may be technologically feasible to transplant differentiated ES cells and to cure various kinds of blood disorders. Understanding the biology of ES cell derived hematopoiesis may lead to the development of co-transplantation protocols that will result in a decreased morbidity and mortality by providing safer and simpler transplantation procedures for patients with malignant and non-malignant conditions. The potential utility of ES cells for gene therapy, tissue engineering and the treatment of a wide variety of currently untreatable diseases is simply too essential to ignore, however, our knowledge and ability to deliver these forms of therapy in a safe and efficient manner requires additional advances in the understanding of the basic biology of ES cells. In this article, we will discuss the factors and methodologies responsible for the differentiation of ES cells into hematopoietic progenitors and their potential to treat different blood related diseases.","['Srivastava, Anand S', 'Malhotra, Rakesh', 'Esmaeli-Azad, Babak', 'Lane, Tom', 'Carrier, Ewa']","['Srivastava AS', 'Malhotra R', 'Esmaeli-Azad B', 'Lane T', 'Carrier E']","['Department of Anatomy and Neurobiology, University of California Irvine, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Netherlands,Curr Pharm Biotechnol,Current pharmaceutical biotechnology,100960530,,IM,"['Animals', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/cytology/physiology/*transplantation', 'Hematologic Diseases/pathology/*surgery', 'Hematopoiesis/physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/methods/*trends', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/physiology', 'Humans']",2007/11/06 09:00,2008/04/09 09:00,['2007/11/06 09:00'],"['2007/11/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/09 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/06 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.2174/138920107782109949 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Pharm Biotechnol. 2007 Oct;8(5):305-17. doi: 10.2174/138920107782109949.,,,,,,,,187,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, even if the immune response occurs, can it clear the virus completely? OBJECTIVE: To detect parvovirus B19 DNA and its antibodies in bone marrow cells and in serum by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia receiving chemotherapy to highlight the relation of humoral immune response to the presence of viremia. Also, to evaluate the optimal diagnostic test(s) for a correct diagnosis of parvovirus B19 disease in immunocompromised patients. DESIGN: Forty-eight children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia receiving maintenance chemotherapy were included in the study in addition to 20 healthy children with matched age and sex. Study for parvovirus B19 was performed by serologic determination of specific immunoglobulin (Ig) M and IgG, and viral DNA was determined by PCR in both serum and bone marrow aspiration. RESULTS: Parvovirus B19 DNA was detected in both serum and bone marrow in 20% of patients. Specific IgG was found in 40% and IgM in 26.7%. Two cases (10%) in the control group were positive for IgG. The agreement between IgG and positive results of PCR in the bone marrow was 33.3%, and the agreement for IgM and PCR in the serum was 33.3%. CONCLUSIONS: Parvovirus B19 is considered a common viral infection in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia receiving chemotherapy. We must use our full potential to exclude such infection, which can mimic the side effects of chemotherapy in these patients. In immunocompromised patients, there are immunologic discrepancies in humoral immune responses for both IgM and IgG between individuals with parvovirus B19 persistence and healthy individuals, findings that may reflect both failed immunity and antigenic exhaustion. The contemporaneous determination of parvovirus B19 DNA by PCR in both bone marrow and peripheral blood and specific serologic markers appears to be the most appropriate diagnostic protocol for the correct laboratory diagnosis of parvovirus B19 infection in these patients.","['el-Sayed Zaki, Maysaa']",['el-Sayed Zaki M'],"['Department of Pathology, Mansoura University, Mansoura, Egypt. may_s65@hotmail.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Arch Pathol Lab Med,Archives of pathology & laboratory medicine,7607091,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'DNA, Viral/metabolism', 'Erythema Infectiosum/*diagnosis/etiology/*immunology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G/*metabolism', 'Immunoglobulin M/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Parvovirus B19, Human/genetics/immunology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/*drug therapy', 'Prospective Studies']",2007/11/06 09:00,2007/12/06 09:00,['2007/11/06 09:00'],"['2007/06/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/11/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['2007-0092-OAR1 [pii]', '10.5858/2007-131-1697-ROSIMA [doi]']",ppublish,Arch Pathol Lab Med. 2007 Nov;131(11):1697-9. doi: 10.5858/2007-131-1697-ROSIMA.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Analysis of 178 cases].,819-23,"INTRODUCTION: Adult patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) frequently present retinal abnormalities. We tried to find a relationship between fundus lesions and treatment responsiveness, prognosis, and several hematologic parameters. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We examined 178 adult patients with newly diagnosed AML. All patients were assigned to two groups regarding retinal parameters (1 or 2) and age (A or B). Group 1 included cases with retinal dysfunction classified as retinal abnormalities with impaired visual acuity; group 2 included cases with no or only minor retinal changes. Subgroup A included patients younger than 60 years (n=97), subgroup B patients older than 60 years (n=81). RESULTS: In this study, higher age and a lower Hb value were associated with retinal findings (group 1). Among the younger patients (subgroup A), 78% of those with complete remission had no retinal findings (group 2) compared to 18% of the nonresponders. In the elderly population (subgroup B), this ratio was 58% versus 19%. In the younger patients (subgroup A), the mean overall survival was 50 months if they had no retinal abnormalities (group 2) and 7 months in the case of retinal changes (group 1). In the older population (subgroup B), the ratio was 15 months versus 3 months, respectively. CONCLUSION: Retinal abnormalities in AML are generally associated with higher age, although they correlate with a shorter survival in both age groups.

To further investigate the mechanisms of resistance to Ara-C, we have established Ara-C-resistant NALM-6 cells. The activation of nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) was accompanied by the acquisition of Ara-C resistance. Telomerase activity has also increased with the acquisition of Ara-C resistance. The expression of Bid, Bax, or p53 proteins have been shown to increase correlated with the acquisition of Ara-C resistance. In contrast to the increase in these proteins, Bcl-2, Bcl-x, and Bag-1 proteins remained unchanged with the acquisition of Ara-C resistance. Fas expression increased with the acquisition of Ara-C resistance in the late stage. The induction of apoptosis and reduction of cell viability by cytotoxic anti-Fas antibody was more susceptible in resistant cells than parental cells. In conclusion, this report has shown that resistance to Ara-C up-regulates the activation of NF-kappaB, telomerase activity and Fas expression.","['Kanno, Syu-ichi', 'Hiura, Takako', 'Shouji, Ai', 'Osanai, Yuu', 'Ujibe, Mayuko', 'Ishikawa, Masaaki']","['Kanno S', 'Hiura T', 'Shouji A', 'Osanai Y', 'Ujibe M', 'Ishikawa M']","['Department of Clinical Pharmacotherapeutics, Tohoku Pharmaceutical University, 4-4-1 Komatsushima, Aoba-ku, Sendai, Japan. syu-kan@tohoku-pharm.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Japan,Biol Pharm Bull,Biological & pharmaceutical bulletin,9311984,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein)', '0 (BID protein, human)', '0 (Formazans)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Tetrazolium Salts)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '23305-68-2 (MTT formazan)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytarabine/*pharmacology/toxicity', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Formazans/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/enzymology/metabolism/pathology', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Telomerase/*metabolism', 'Tetrazolium Salts/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism', 'fas Receptor/metabolism']",2007/11/06 09:00,2007/12/28 09:00,['2007/11/06 09:00'],"['2007/11/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/28 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['JST.JSTAGE/bpb/30.2069 [pii]', '10.1248/bpb.30.2069 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Pharm Bull. 2007 Nov;30(11):2069-74. doi: 10.1248/bpb.30.2069.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We initiated a phase 1 clinical trial vaccinating 10 patients with R3 (ILSLELMKL), a highly immunogenic CD8(+) T-cell epitope peptide derived from RHAMM. In 7 of 10 patients, we detected an increase of CD8(+)/HLA-A2/RHAMM R3 tetramer(+)/CD45RA(+)/CCR7(-)/CD27(-)/CD28(-) effector T cells in accordance with an increase of R3-specific CD8(+) T cells in enzyme linked immunospot (ELISpot) assays. In chromium release assays, a specific lysis of RHAMM-positive leukemic blasts was shown. Three of 6 patients with myeloid disorders (1/3 AML, 2/3 MDS) achieved clinical responses: one patient with AML and one with MDS showed a significant reduction of blasts in the bone marrow after the last vaccination. One patient with MDS no longer needed erythrocyte transfusions after 4 vaccinations. Two of 4 patients with MM showed a reduction of free light chain serum levels. Taken together, RHAMM-R3 peptide vaccination induced both immunologic and clinical responses, and therefore RHAMM constitutes a promising target for further immunotherapeutic approaches.

The antiviral activity and resistance profile in vitro of a novel IN inhibitor, elvitegravir (EVG) (also known as JTK-303/GS-9137), currently being developed for the treatment of HIV-1 infection are described. EVG blocked the integration of HIV-1 cDNA through the inhibition of DNA strand transfer. EVG inhibited the replication of HIV-1, including various subtypes and multiple-drug-resistant clinical isolates, and HIV-2 strains with a 50% effective concentration in the subnanomolar to nanomolar range. EVG-resistant variants were selected in two independent inductions, and a total of 8 amino acid substitutions in the catalytic core domain of IN were observed. Among the observed IN mutations, T66I and E92Q substitutions mainly contributed to EVG resistance. These two primary resistance mutations are located in the active site, and other secondary mutations identified are proximal to these primary mutations. The EVG-selected IN mutations, some of which represent novel IN inhibitor resistance mutations, conferred reduced susceptibility to other IN inhibitors, suggesting that a common mechanism is involved in resistance and potential cross-resistance. The replication capacity of EVG-resistant variants was significantly reduced relative to both wild-type virus and other IN inhibitor-resistant variants selected by L-870,810. EVG and L-870,810 both inhibited the replication of murine leukemia virus and simian immunodeficiency virus, suggesting that IN inhibitors bind to a conformationally conserved region of various retroviral IN enzymes and are an ideal drug for a range of retroviral infections.","['Shimura, Kazuya', 'Kodama, Eiichi', 'Sakagami, Yasuko', 'Matsuzaki, Yuji', 'Watanabe, Wataru', 'Yamataka, Kazunobu', 'Watanabe, Yasuo', 'Ohata, Yoshitsugu', 'Doi, Satoki', 'Sato, Motohide', 'Kano, Mitsuki', 'Ikeda, Satoru', 'Matsuoka, Masao']","['Shimura K', 'Kodama E', 'Sakagami Y', 'Matsuzaki Y', 'Watanabe W', 'Yamataka K', 'Watanabe Y', 'Ohata Y', 'Doi S', 'Sato M', 'Kano M', 'Ikeda S', 'Matsuoka M']","['Laboratory of Virus Immunology, Institute for Virus Research, Kyoto University, 53 Kawaramachi, Shogoin, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto 606-8507, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071031,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Anti-HIV Agents)', '0 (Integrase Inhibitors)', '0 (Quinolones)', '4GDQ854U53 (elvitegravir)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Substitution/genetics', 'Anti-HIV Agents/*pharmacology', 'Binding Sites', 'Drug Resistance, Viral/*genetics', 'HIV-1/*drug effects', 'HIV-2/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Integrase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/drug effects', 'Microbial Sensitivity Tests', 'Quinolones/*pharmacology', 'Simian Immunodeficiency Virus/drug effects', 'Virus Replication/genetics']",2007/11/06 09:00,2008/01/25 09:00,['2007/11/06 09:00'],"['2007/11/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/25 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['JVI.01534-07 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.01534-07 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2008 Jan;82(2):764-74. doi: 10.1128/JVI.01534-07.

This study investigated the pharmacological profile and therapeutic potential of YM-58483 as anti-asthma drug. YM-58483 inhibited DNP antigen-induced histamine release from and leukotrienes (LTs) production in IgE-primed RBL-2H3 cells, a rat basophilic leukemia cell line, with IC50 values of 460 and 310 nM, respectively. Prednisolone did not inhibit either of these responses. YM-58483 also inhibited phytohemagglutinin-P (PHA)-stimulated IL-5 and IL-13 production in human peripheral blood cells with IC50 values of 125 and 148 nM, respectively, which is approximately 5 times less potent than prednisolone. YM-58483 (30 mg/kg, p.o.) significantly suppressed ovalbumin (OVA)-induced bronchoconstriction in OVA-sensitized guinea pigs, whereas prednisolone did not. YM-58483 (3-30 mg/kg, p.o.) and prednisolone (100mg/kg, p.o.) both significantly and completely suppressed airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) caused by OVA exposure. Since YM-58483 inhibits two major characteristic symptoms of bronchial asthma, namely bronchoconstriction and AHR via the suppression of inflammatory mediator and cytokine production, SOCE inhibition is a potential approach for treatment.","['Ohga, Keiko', 'Takezawa, Ryuichi', 'Yoshino, Taiji', 'Yamada, Toshimitsu', 'Shimizu, Yasuaki', 'Ishikawa, Jun']","['Ohga K', 'Takezawa R', 'Yoshino T', 'Yamada T', 'Shimizu Y', 'Ishikawa J']","['Pharmacology Research Laboratories, Institute for Drug Discovery Research, Astellas Pharma Inc., 21 Miyukigaoka, Tsukuba-shi, Ibaraki 305-8585, Japan. keiko.ohga@jp.astellas.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20071002,England,Pulm Pharmacol Ther,Pulmonary pharmacology & therapeutics,9715279,"['0', ""(4-methyl-4'-(3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)-1H-pyrazol-1-yl)-1,2,3-thiadiazole-5-carbo"", 'xanilide)', '0 (Anilides)', '0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents)', '0 (Calcium Channel Blockers)', '0 (Dinitrophenols)', '0 (Leukotrienes)', '0 (Phytohemagglutinins)', '0 (Thiadiazoles)', '0 (dinitrophenyl-bovine serum albumin)', '0 (phytohemagglutinin-P)', '27432CM55Q (Serum Albumin, Bovine)', '9006-59-1 (Ovalbumin)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Anilides/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Animals', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Blood Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Bronchial Hyperreactivity/immunology/prevention & control', 'Bronchoconstriction/drug effects', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Calcium Channel Blockers/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Line', 'Dinitrophenols/immunology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Guinea Pigs', 'Histamine Release/drug effects', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukotrienes/biosynthesis', 'Male', 'Muscle Contraction/drug effects', 'Muscle, Smooth/drug effects/immunology/physiopathology', 'Ovalbumin/immunology', 'Phytohemagglutinins/immunology', 'Prednisolone/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Rats', 'Serum Albumin, Bovine/immunology', 'Thiadiazoles/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Trachea/drug effects/immunology/physiopathology']",2007/11/06 09:00,2008/08/02 09:00,['2007/11/06 09:00'],"['2007/05/03 00:00 [received]', '2007/09/24 00:00 [revised]', '2007/09/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/11/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/02 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1094-5539(07)00091-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.pupt.2007.09.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Pulm Pharmacol Ther. 2008;21(2):360-9. doi: 10.1016/j.pupt.2007.09.003.

METHODS: We compared the incidence of cancer and the mortality by cancer in a cohort of 789 randomly selected RA patients (1999-2005) with the expected ones in the general population. We estimated standardized incidence ratios (SIR) and standardized mortality ratios (SMR) by indirect age and sex standardization. Additionally, we analyzed by generalized linear models the association of various predictors with cancer incidence, obtaining incidence rate ratios (IRR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS: The SIR of cancer in RA is 1.23 (95% CI: 0.78-1.85). By cancer type, there is an increased risk of leukemia, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and lung cancer in RA compared with the general population of the same sex and age. The SMR of cancer is 1.0 (95% CI: 0.53-1.7). By cancer type, RA patients with lung or kidney cancer have higher mortality than expected. Being male, elderly, with longstanding disease, and having used any cytotoxic drugs apart from methotrexate are confirmed as predictive factors for cancer. Additional independent predictors are increases in blood leukocyte counts (IRR per 3000 u/mm3 increase: 1.88 (95% CI: 1.6 -2.1)) and decreases in serum hemoglobin (IRR per 2 g/l decrease: 1.88 (95% CI: 1.19 -2.94)). CONCLUSIONS: The overall incidence and mortality of cancer in RA is not greater than the expected, although there is an increased risk of hematopoietic and lung cancers in RA patients compared with the general population. Hemoglobin and leukocyte counts may help to identify RA patients at risk for cancer.","['Abasolo, Lydia', 'Judez, Enrique', 'Descalzo, Miguel Angel', 'Gonzalez-Alvaro, Isidoro', 'Jover, Juan Angel', 'Carmona, Loreto']","['Abasolo L', 'Judez E', 'Descalzo MA', 'Gonzalez-Alvaro I', 'Jover JA', 'Carmona L']","['Rheumatology Department, Hospital Clinico San Carlos, Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071030,United States,Semin Arthritis Rheum,Seminars in arthritis and rheumatism,1306053,,IM,"['Aged', 'Arthritis, Rheumatoid/*complications/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*complications/*mortality', 'Prevalence', 'Risk Factors', 'Spain/epidemiology']",2007/11/06 09:00,2008/10/08 09:00,['2007/11/06 09:00'],"['2007/03/13 00:00 [received]', '2007/06/27 00:00 [revised]', '2007/08/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/11/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/08 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0049-0172(07)00142-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.semarthrit.2007.08.006 [doi]']",ppublish,Semin Arthritis Rheum. 2008 Jun;37(6):388-97. doi: 10.1016/j.semarthrit.2007.08.006.

Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) has poor prognosis, suggesting that ATLL cells possess common stem cell properties. We analyzed side population (SP), a characteristic stem cell phenotype, and CD markers in ATLL cell lines. We found that several lines contained SP with expressions of some hematopoietic stem cell markers. On the other hand, treatment with interferon (IFN)-alpha is sometimes effective in ATLL, particularly combined with other drugs. We examined its effect on ATLL cells and found that IFN-alpha significantly reduced the SP proportion. Moreover, CD25-positive cells and phosphorylation of STAT1/5 and ERK were upregulated during this process. These data suggest that their stem cell properties render ATLL cells therapy-resistant, and IFN-alpha exerts its clinical effect through a reduction of the SP cell population.","['Kayo, Hiroyuki', 'Yamazaki, Hiroto', 'Nishida, Hiroko', 'Dang, Nam H', 'Morimoto, Chikao']","['Kayo H', 'Yamazaki H', 'Nishida H', 'Dang NH', 'Morimoto C']","['Division of Clinical Immunology, Advanced Clinical Research Center, Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo, 4-6-1 Shirokanedai, Minato-ku, Tokyo 108-8639, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071022,United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Delivery Systems/*methods', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/*administration & dosage', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Stem Cells/drug effects/*metabolism/*pathology']",2007/11/06 09:00,2007/12/19 09:00,['2007/11/06 09:00'],"['2007/09/14 00:00 [received]', '2007/10/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/11/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/19 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-291X(07)02235-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2007.10.070 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2007 Dec 28;364(4):808-14. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2007.10.070.

Only 289 case histories were suitable for analysis. In this paper we present the distribution of patients according to the risk group denomination prepared by the Toronto Leukaemia Study Group of Canada. The effect of such stratification of patients with AML is evaluated in our patients. The results are here with discussed. 160 male (median age = 57.7 yr.) and 128 female (median age = 58.0 yr.) patients are presented. Distribution of these patients according to the age is compared to the distribution of similar patients included in the British AML-8 trials and with the total incidence of newly diagnosed AML in England and Wales, in one year (1983). It is shown that the cohort of patients, included in the recognized foreign trials, is not representative of the natural population with respect to morbidity and mortality from AML--similar conclusion concerns this group of patients which comprises the largest single-centre series reported hitherto in the Yugoslavia literature. Thus, the success of therapy of AML as reported in available literature from this country and elsewhere is necessarily, and perhaps incautiously, inflated and statistically distored. The number of complete remissions and the median survival-time of the patients presented varied significantly in our study in accordance with the exclusion steps performed. Without the exclusion of risk groups the percentage of complete remissions was 35.3 per cent and the median survival was 3.0 months. With all the substractions these values were 51.72 per cent and 7.0 months, respectively.","['Jankovic, G', 'Ristic, M', 'Colovic, M', 'Petrovic, M', 'Jancic, M S', 'Tomasevic, R', 'Bogdanovic, G', 'Radoncevic, R']","['Jankovic G', 'Ristic M', 'Colovic M', 'Petrovic M', 'Jancic MS', 'Tomasevic R', 'Bogdanovic G', 'Radoncevic R']",,['srp'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,Serbia,Srp Arh Celok Lek,Srpski arhiv za celokupno lekarstvo,0027440,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/classification/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",1990/03/01 00:00,2008/01/09 09:00,['1990/03/01 00:00'],"['1990/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/09 09:00 [medline]', '1990/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Srp Arh Celok Lek. 1990 Mar-Apr;118(3-4):89-95.,Lecenje bolesnika sa akutnom mijeloidnom leukemijom--primena Toronto kriterijuma u proceni uspeha lecenja.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CASE: An unusual case of hematocolpometra secondary to vaginal stenosis occurred as a manifestation of chronic GvHD. CONCLUSION: Management of vaginal stenosis and stricture formation as a manifestation of chronic GvHD consists of surgery with lysis of adhesions. Return of anatomic distortion to normal is followed by vaginal dilatation. Later, local estrogen cream and sexual activity help to avoid further adhesion formation.","['Rodolakis, Alexandros', 'Thomakos, Nikolaos', 'Harhalakis, Nicholas', 'Iconomou, Thomais', 'Antsaklis, Aris']","['Rodolakis A', 'Thomakos N', 'Harhalakis N', 'Iconomou T', 'Antsaklis A']","['First Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Alexandra Hospital, University of Athens.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,United States,J Reprod Med,The Journal of reproductive medicine,0173343,,IM,"['Adult', 'Constriction, Pathologic', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*etiology', 'Hematometra/*etiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*surgery', 'Vaginal Diseases/*etiology/pathology/surgery']",2007/11/06 09:00,2008/01/26 09:00,['2007/11/06 09:00'],"['2007/11/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/26 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/06 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Reprod Med. 2007 Oct;52(10):959-61.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Imatinib is now the treatment of choice for most newly diagnosed patients. Excellent responses, in terms of symptom control and haematological parameters, are usually obtained. However, failure to completely eradicate leukaemic cells and the escape of these cells from previous control has led to an intensive search for the mechanisms of resistance and subsequent treatments by which to overcome this resistance. Up to now, there has been considerable focus on the role of ABL-kinase-domain mutations as mediators of resistance to imatinib, thereby encouraging the development of a second generation of TKIs capable of inhibiting these mutant proteins. However, studies have increasingly shown that these mutations do not account for all cases of resistance and have a negligible role in the inability of TKIs to eradicate residual disease in patients who are good responders. More recently, attention has turned to the relative roles of drug bioavailability and drug efflux and drug influx proteins in the development of resistance to imatinib. This review is the first of two papers and discusses imatinib resistance and its potential causes. The second paper will focus on the assessment and subsequent management of patients with less than optimum responses to imatinib.","['Apperley, Jane F']",['Apperley JF'],"['Department of Haematology, Imperial College, Hammersmith Hospital, London, UK. j.apperley@imperial.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,England,Lancet Oncol,The Lancet.

Systemic mastocytosis with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is frequently seen among SM-AHNMD. However, the pathogenesis or origin of neoplastic mast cells has not been fully elucidated in this category of diseases. METHODS: We examined KIT mutation, chimeric status, and AML1/ETO mRNA concerning mast cells and immature hematopoietic cells of the bone marrow in a patient with systemic mastocytosis with AML1/ETO-positive AML following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). RESULTS: Mast cells of the patient displayed KIT D816Y mutation, and were derived from the recipient. In contrast, immature hematopoietic cells as defined by CD34+ CD117+ were derived from the donor, which did not possess detectable KIT D816Y mutation. The ratio of AML1/ETO to 18S rRNA of the mast cells was 7.53, whereas that of immature hematopoietic cells was 1.67. CONCLUSIONS: In a patient with SM-AHNMD who underwent allogeneic HSCT, the major source of the detectable AML1/ETO mRNA of the bone marrow after transplantation was neoplastic mast cells with KIT mutation, which were thought to be derived from CD34+ CD117+ immature leukemic cells of the recipient.","['Nagai, Sumimasa', 'Ichikawa, Motoshi', 'Takahashi, Tsuyoshi', 'Sato, Hiroyuki', 'Yokota, Hiromitsu', 'Oshima, Kumi', 'Izutsu, Koji', 'Hangaishi, Akira', 'Kanda, Yoshinobu', 'Motokura, Toru', 'Chiba, Shigeru', 'Yatomi, Yutaka', 'Kurokawa, Mineo']","['Nagai S', 'Ichikawa M', 'Takahashi T', 'Sato H', 'Yokota H', 'Oshima K', 'Izutsu K', 'Hangaishi A', 'Kanda Y', 'Motokura T', 'Chiba S', 'Yatomi Y', 'Kurokawa M']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine and Faculty of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (AML1-ETO fusion protein, human)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antigens, CD34', 'Cell Lineage', '*Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*etiology/pathology', 'Mast Cells/*pathology', 'Mastocytosis, Systemic/classification/complications/*pathology', 'Mutation', '*Oncogene Proteins, Fusion', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/genetics', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2007/11/03 09:00,2008/01/08 09:00,['2007/11/03 09:00'],"['2007/05/27 00:00 [received]', '2007/07/20 00:00 [revised]', '2007/08/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/11/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/08 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-472X(07)00524-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2007.08.016 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2007 Nov;35(11):1747-52. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2007.08.016.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A patient's life expectancy can range from a few months to more than a decade. Recent studies provide some insight into the pathophysiology of MDS. One mechanism contributing to the constellation of hypercellular marrow and peripheral blood cytopenia is a significant increase in programmed cell death (apoptosis) in hematopoietic cells. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, Fas ligand, TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand, and other proapoptotic cytokines are upregulated in early-stage/low-risk MDS, and neutralization of these signals can improve hematopoiesis. TNF-related apoptosis inducing ligand induces apoptosis preferentially in clonal cells, which can contribute to containment of the clone. In a proportion of patients, MDS will eventually evolve to acute leukemia. This progression has been correlated with upregulation of nuclear factor kappaB; altered expression of adaptor molecules, such as Flice inhibitory protein; and enhanced activity of antiapoptotic members of the Bcl-2 and inhibitors of apoptosis protein families. Also, the ratio of TNF receptors 1 and 2 changes in favor of receptor 2. The role of the microenvironment in the pathophysiology and progression of MDS has remained controversial, although there is evidence that stroma and matrix components, and their interactions with clonal cells, play an important role. Microarray gene-expression studies are consistent with dysregulation of apoptosis, but not all data are in agreement.","['Kerbauy, Daniella B', 'Deeg, H Joachim']","['Kerbauy DB', 'Deeg HJ']","['Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and the University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, WA 98109-1024, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,,IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Disease Progression', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/genetics/*pathology', 'Signal Transduction']",2007/11/03 09:00,2008/01/08 09:00,['2007/11/03 09:00'],"['2007/05/18 00:00 [received]', '2007/09/12 00:00 [revised]', '2007/09/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/11/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/08 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-472X(07)00578-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2007.09.007 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2007 Nov;35(11):1739-46. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2007.09.007.,,"['P01 HL036444-270016/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL36444/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL082941/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL082941-03/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA119599/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL082941/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA119599-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 HL036444/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA119599/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC2131709,['NIHMS34139'],,68,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Twenty-four patients (male, n = 16; female, n = 8) with a median age of 52 years (range, 32-63 years) were included. Six patients were transplanted from human leukocyte antigen-identical siblings and 18 patients from matched unrelated donors. Diagnosis was primary myelofibrosis in 18 patients and secondary myelofibrosis in 6 patients; in 4 of them, primary myelofibrosis evolved from polycythemia vera, and in 2 of them from essential thrombocythemia. Using the European Consensus on grading bone marrow fibrosis, all patients had advanced marrow fibrosis MF-2 (n = 13) or MF-3 (n = 11) before allografting According to the Lille Risk Factor Scoring System, patients were classified as low risk (n = 5), intermediate risk (n = 16), or high risk (n = 3). RESULTS: After stem cell transplantation, a complete (MF-0) or nearly complete (MF-1) regression of bone marrow fibrosis was seen in 59% at day +100, in 90% at day +180, and in 100% at day +360. No correlation between occurrence of acute graft-vs-host disease and fibrosis regression on day +180 was observed. CONCLUSION: This study shows that allogeneic stem cell transplantation after reduced-intensity conditioning resulted in rapid regression of bone-marrow fibrosis.","['Kroger, Nicolaus', 'Thiele, Jurgen', 'Zander, Axel', 'Schwerdtfeger, Rainer', 'Kobbe, Guido', 'Bornhauser, Martin', 'Bethge, Wolfgang', 'Schubert, Jorg', 'de Witte, Theo', 'Kvasnicka, Hans Michael']","['Kroger N', 'Thiele J', 'Zander A', 'Schwerdtfeger R', 'Kobbe G', 'Bornhauser M', 'Bethge W', 'Schubert J', 'de Witte T', 'Kvasnicka HM']","['Department of Stem Cell Transplantation, University Hospital Hamburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Bone Marrow Examination', 'Busulfan/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/*therapy', 'Remission Induction/methods', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Transplantation Conditioning/methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives']",2007/11/03 09:00,2008/01/08 09:00,['2007/11/03 09:00'],"['2007/05/29 00:00 [received]', '2007/08/13 00:00 [revised]', '2007/08/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/11/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/08 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-472X(07)00531-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2007.08.022 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2007 Nov;35(11):1719-22. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2007.08.022.,,,,,,,,,"['MDS-Subcommittee of the Chronic Leukaemia Working Party of the European Group for', 'Blood and Marrow Transplantation']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The number of PRV-1-expressing neutrophils increases in pregnancy and sepsis, or after administration of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. Expression of the PRV-1 gene is also increased in patients with polycythemia vera (PV) and essential thrombocythemia (ET). We investigated whether DNA methylation of the PRV-1 gene has a role in regulation of transcription and expression of the PRV-1 protein. METHODS: We compared the level of methylation of the PRV-1 gene and expression of the PRV-1 mRNA in normal neutrophils expressing PRV-1 to those that are PRV-1-negative. We also studied PRV-1 methylation and mRNA expression in patients with Philadelphia chromosome-negative myeloproliferative disorders and in an in vitro model of DNA demethylation. RESULTS: We found that methylation of CpG dinucleotides close to initiation codon of the PRV-1 gene was inversely related to expression of PRV-1 in normal neutrophils. Furthermore, overexpression of the PRV-1 gene in PV and ET is associated with a decrease in methylation of this gene. Among patients with PV and ET, methylation of the PRV-1 gene is also inversely correlated with the presence of the JAK2(V617F) somatic mutation. In an in vitro model, exposure of KG1 and KG1a cells to a DNA demethylating agent caused a decrease in methylation of the PRV-1 gene and increased its mRNA level. CONCLUSION: DNA methylation regulates PRV-1 expression under physiologic and pathologic conditions.","['Jelinek, Jaroslav', 'Li, Jun', 'Mnjoyan, Zakar', 'Issa, Jean-Pierre J', 'Prchal, Josef T', 'Afshar-Kharghan, Vahid']","['Jelinek J', 'Li J', 'Mnjoyan Z', 'Issa JP', 'Prchal JT', 'Afshar-Kharghan V']","['Department of Leukemia, University of Texas M.

Novel JAK2 mutations were recently described in 5% to 15% of patients that are JAK2617V>F-negative. Additionally, JAK2 is reported to form fusion hybrids with three different genes. We, therefore, hypothesized that patients with 9p24 chromosomal rearrangements or patients with Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-negative myeloproliferative disorders (MPDs), with or without +9/+9p chromosomal abnormalities, might demonstrate additional and/or cryptic JAK2 structural rearrangements. METHODS: Metaphase and interphase cells were retrospectively investigated from 39 patients using two JAK2 BAC fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) probes on archived fixed cell suspensions. Of the 39 patients, 8 had PV with chromosome 9 abnormalities, 7 had PMF/MPD showing an abnormal karyotype, 10 PV patients were cytogenetically normal, and 14 patients had 9p24 chromosomal abnormalities. RESULTS: FISH studies revealed 11 JAK2617V>F-positive patients with JAK2 numerical and structural abnormalities. Trisomy through hexasomy as well as JAK2 amplification (15-20 copies) was observed in nine patients (PV, 6; non-Hodgkin lymphoma [NHL], 1; multiple myeloma, 1; and MDS, 1), while JAK2 structural abnormalities were seen in two patients (MDS and NHL). Among the seven patients negative for JAK2617V>F mutation, two patients with MDS were observed with JAK2 rearrangements involving NF-E2 and AML1. The status of JAK2617V>F mutation could not be determined in 13 patients, but FISH studies revealed both gain and rearrangements in three patients. They include one patient with PV and +9p with three copies of JAK2 and two patients with MDS and JAK2 relocations: one with NF-E2, while the other patient with a TEL/ETV6 rearrangements also had tetrasomy for JAK2. CONCLUSION: JAK2 FISH studies revealed two types of JAK2 rearrangements among patients with Ph-negative MPDs and non-MPDs: gain and/or structural rearrangements. Gain and amplification of JAK2 was primarily observed in patients that were JAK2617V>F-positive (9 of 11), irrespective of the diagnosis, while rearrangements of JAK2 were frequently seen in patients who lacked the JAK2617V>F mutation with either MDS or AML (5 of 6). Three different JAK2 abnormalities were identified in one clone for the first time in two patients with PV. The data also identified a myriad of JAK2 rearrangements, including a novel JAK2-NF-E2 interaction, JAK2 translocation to chromosomes 3, 4, 12, 14, and 21 and detection of the previously described rare TEL/ETV6-JAK2 translocation. These observations suggest that JAK2 attracts multiple gene partners and may contribute to disease progression in patients with MDS and B-cell malignancies, while the JAK2 copy number appears to be important in pathogenesis of Ph-negative MPDs.","['Najfeld, Vesna', 'Cozza, Amanda', 'Berkofsy-Fessler, Windy', 'Prchal, Josef', 'Scalise, Angela']","['Najfeld V', 'Cozza A', 'Berkofsy-Fessler W', 'Prchal J', 'Scalise A']","['Department of Pathology, Tumor Cytogenetics Laboratory, The Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, NY 10029, USA. vesna.najfeld@mssm.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,['EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Gene Dosage', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Janus Kinase 2/*genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*genetics', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Protein Transport', 'Retrospective Studies']",2007/11/03 09:00,2008/01/08 09:00,['2007/11/03 09:00'],"['2007/05/16 00:00 [received]', '2007/08/20 00:00 [revised]', '2007/08/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/11/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/08 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-472X(07)00534-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2007.08.025 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2007 Nov;35(11):1668-76. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2007.08.025.,,['1P01CA108671-01A2/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These results suggest that in neurogenic regions, cooperative action of LIF and other neuro-differentiation-inducing factors, such as retinoic acid, may be mediated by the STAT3 signalling pathway.","['Pachernik, J', 'Horvath, V', 'Kubala, L', 'Dvorak, P', 'Kozubik, A', 'Hampl, A']","['Pachernik J', 'Horvath V', 'Kubala L', 'Dvorak P', 'Kozubik A', 'Hampl A']","['Department of Animal Physiology and Immunology, Institute of Experimental Biology, Masaryk University, Faculty of Science, Brno, Czech Republic. jipa@sci.muni.cz']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Czech Republic,Folia Biol (Praha),Folia biologica,0234640,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Butadienes)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Tyrphostins)', '0 (U 0126)', '0 (alpha-cyano-(3,4-dihydroxy)-N-benzylcinnamide)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biomarkers/metabolism', 'Butadienes/pharmacology', 'Carcinoma, Embryonal/enzymology/*pathology', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/metabolism', 'Janus Kinase 2/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*pharmacology', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Neurons/*cytology/*drug effects', 'Nitriles/pharmacology', 'Response Elements', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Transcriptional Activation/drug effects', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tyrphostins/pharmacology']",2007/11/03 09:00,2008/04/05 09:00,['2007/11/03 09:00'],"['2007/11/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/05 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/03 09:00 [entrez]']",['FB2007A0023 [pii]'],ppublish,Folia Biol (Praha). 2007;53(5):157-63.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we have studied the expression and activity of the enzymes involved in the synthesis of leukotriene B4 (LTB4) in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells (16 clones) and G-CSF mobilized peripheral blood CD34+ cells. CD34+ cells from patients with non-myeloid malignancies expressed cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2), 5-lipoxygenase activating protein (FLAP), and leukotriene A4 (LTA4) hydrolase but not 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO). The enzyme cPLA2 was abundantly expressed in AML cells and the activity of the enzyme was high in certain AML clones. The expression of 5-LO, FLAP, and LTA4 hydrolase in AML clones was in general lower than in healthy donor polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNL). The calcium ionophore A23187-induced release of [14C] arachidonic acid (AA) in AML cells was low, compared with PMNL, and did not correlate with the expression of cPLA2 protein. Biosynthesis of LTB4, upon calcium ionophore A23187 activation, was only observed in five of the investigated AML clones and only three of the most differentiated clones produced similar amounts of LTB4 as PMNL. The capacity of various cell clones to produce LTs could neither be explained by the difference in [1-(14)C] AA release nor 5-LO expression. Taken together, these results indicate that LT synthesis is under development during early myelopoiesis and the capacity to produce LTs is gained upon maturation. High expression of cPLA2 in AML suggests a putative role of this enzyme in the pathophysiology of this disease.","['Runarsson, Gudmundur', 'Feltenmark, Stina', 'Forsell, Pontus K A', 'Sjoberg, Jan', 'Bjorkholm, Magnus', 'Claesson, Hans-Erik']","['Runarsson G', 'Feltenmark S', 'Forsell PK', 'Sjoberg J', 'Bjorkholm M', 'Claesson HE']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071101,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Ionophores)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '1HGW4DR56D (Leukotriene B4)', '37H9VM9WZL (Calcimycin)', 'EC 1.13.11.34 (Arachidonate 5-Lipoxygenase)', 'EC 3.1.1.4 (Phospholipases A2, Cytosolic)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD34/biosynthesis', 'Arachidonate 5-Lipoxygenase/biosynthesis', 'Calcimycin/pharmacology', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Ionophores/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*blood', 'Leukotriene B4/*biosynthesis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Models, Biological', 'Phospholipases A2, Cytosolic/*biosynthesis']",2007/11/03 09:00,2007/12/07 09:00,['2007/11/03 09:00'],"['2007/11/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/07 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['EJH967 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0609.2007.00967.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2007 Dec;79(6):468-76. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2007.00967.x.

There is a controversy about antitumor activity of fludarabine in multiple myeloma (MM). The aim of this study was to evaluate the activity of fludarabine against human myeloma cells both in vivo and in vitro. We demonstrated that myeloma cell line RPMI8226 was efficiently inhibited by fludarabine, concomitantly with decreased phosphorylation of Akt, down-regulation of the inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAP) family, including XIAP and survivin, and induction of apoptosis related to activation of caspase cascade. Contrary to dexamethasone, the effect of fludarabine on RPMI8226 cells was independent of interleukin-6. Fludarabine also induced cytotoxicity in dexamethasone-sensitive (MM.1S) and -resistant (MM.1R) cells at 48 h with IC50 of 13.48 microg/mL and 33.79 microg/mL, respectively. In contrast, U266 cells were resistant to fludarabine. Moreover, RPMI8226 myeloma xenograft model was established using severe combined immunodeficient mice. The tumors treated with fludarabine at 40 mg/kg increased less than 5-fold in 25 d comparing with approximately 10-fold in the control tumors, demonstrating the antitumor activity of fludarabine in vivo. These results suggest that fludarabine may be an important therapeutic option for MM patients who are resistant to dexamethasone.","['Meng, Haitao', 'Yang, Chunmei', 'Ni, Wanmao', 'Ding, Wei', 'Yang, Xiudi', 'Qian, Wenbin']","['Meng H', 'Yang C', 'Ni W', 'Ding W', 'Yang X', 'Qian W']","['Institute of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071101,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Cycle', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Multiple Myeloma/*drug therapy', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/*pathology', 'Vidarabine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology']",2007/11/03 09:00,2007/12/07 09:00,['2007/11/03 09:00'],"['2007/11/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/07 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['EJH968 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0609.2007.00968.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2007 Dec;79(6):486-93. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2007.00968.x.

ANIMALS: Cattle in 6 dairy herds. PROCEDURES: Blood samples from infected cows were evaluated 3 times at 6-month intervals for determination of proviral load via PCR assay, serologic results via ELISA, and hematologic status via differential cell counts. RESULTS: Infected cattle were classified into lymphocytotic and nonlymphocytotic groups. Lymphocytotic cattle consistently had > 100,000 copies of integrated provirus/mug of DNA (ie, high proviral load) in peripheral blood leukocytes. Titers of antibodies against BLVgp51 and BLVp24 indicated a strong immune response. Nonlymphocytotic cattle comprised 2 subgroups: a group with high proviral load and strong immune response, and a group with a weaker immune response, mostly against BLVp24, and a proviral load of < 100 copies/microg of DNA (ie, low proviral load). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Results emphasized the importance of characterizing nonlymphocytotic BLV-infected cattle during eradication programs. The risk of transmitting BLV infection from nonlymphocytotic cattle may differ depending on the proviral load. Nonlymphocytotic cattle with high proviral load could be efficient transmitters (as efficient as lymphocytotic cattle), whereas nonlymphocytotic cattle with low proviral load could be inefficient transmitters under standard husbandry conditions. Because most cattle with low proviral load do not develop anti-BLVp24 antibodies, it appears that lack of an anti-BLVp24 antibody response may be a good marker of this condition.","['Juliarena, Marcela A', 'Gutierrez, Silvina E', 'Ceriani, Carolina']","['Juliarena MA', 'Gutierrez SE', 'Ceriani C']","['Laboratorio de Virologia, Departamento de Sanidad Animal y Medicina Preventiva, Facultad de Veterinaria, Universidad Nacional del Centro de la Provincia de Buenos Aires, Pinto 399, Tandil, Argentina.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Am J Vet Res,American journal of veterinary research,0375011,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/blood', 'Argentina', 'Cattle', 'DNA, Viral/chemistry/genetics', 'Enzootic Bovine Leukosis/blood/immunology/transmission/*virology', 'Female', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/*growth & development/immunology', 'Leukocyte Count/veterinary', 'Lymphocytosis/immunology/pathology/*veterinary/virology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/veterinary', 'Proviruses/growth & development', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/immunology']",2007/11/03 09:00,2008/01/11 09:00,['2007/11/03 09:00'],"['2007/11/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/11 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/03 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.2460/ajvr.68.11.1220 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Vet Res. 2007 Nov;68(11):1220-5. doi: 10.2460/ajvr.68.11.1220.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Dioscin induced apoptosis in HL-60 cells in a time-dependent manner. Protein profiling of the microsomal fraction with enriched plasma membrane proteins isolated from HL-60 cells revealed that proteins act as chaperones and/or mediators of protein folding and were substantially altered in expression cells upon dioscin stimuli. Further biochemical study indicated that mitochondria dysfunction caused generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to the changes in protein expression. The mitochondrial transmembrane potential (DeltaPsi m) inhibitor aristolochic acid (ArA) partially abrogated the dioscin-initiated death receptor apoptosis pathway and cell death.

The pharmacological CDK inhibitors representing a few distinct classes of compounds exert different target specificity. Considering the fact that dividing and quiescent cells differ in their CDK activity and in the pattern of their expression, one might expect that anti-proliferative efficiency of the pharmacological CDK inhibitors would depend on the mitotic index of treated cells. The present article shows that olomoucine (OLO), a weak CDK2 inhibitor has new, unexpected activity. At concentrations up to 100 microM OLO did not inhibit proliferation of normal human cells, but arrested growth of human HL-60 leukemia cells. The anti-proliferative effect of OLO was clearly weaker than that of roscovitine (ROSC). Surprisingly, OLO at low doses strongly up-regulated a cellular protein with approximately 65 kDa in normal, but not in immortalized and cancer cells. By mass spectrometric analysis CLIMP-63, a cytoskeleton-linking membrane protein was identified as the major component of the up-regulated protein band. These results were subsequently confirmed by immunoblotting.

We hypothesized that down-regulation of interleukin-6 (IL-6) signaling using the monoclonal antibody CNTO 328 would enhance the antitumor activity of the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib in multiple myeloma by attenuating inducible chemoresistance. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The cytotoxicity of bortezomib, CNTO 328, and the combination, along with the associated molecular changes, was assessed in IL-6-dependent and IL-6-independent multiple myeloma cell lines, both in suspension and in the presence of bone marrow stromal cells and in patient-derived myeloma samples. RESULTS: Treatment of IL-6-dependent and IL-6-independent multiple myeloma cell lines with CNTO 328 enhanced the cytotoxicity of bortezomib in a sequence-dependent fashion. This effect was additive to synergistic and was preserved in the presence of bone marrow stromal cells and in CD138(+) myeloma samples derived from patients with relative clinical resistance to bortezomib. CNTO 328 potentiated bortezomib-mediated activation of caspase-8 and caspase-9 and the common downstream effector caspase-3; attenuated bortezomib-mediated induction of antiapoptotic heat shock protein-70, which correlated with down-regulation of phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription-1; and inhibited bortezomib-mediated accumulation of myeloid cell leukemia-1, an effect that was associated with down-regulation of phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription-3.

We showed previously that CREB is amplified in myeloid leukemia blasts and expressed at higher levels in leukemia stem cells from patients with myeloid leukemia. CREB transgenic mice develop myeloproliferative disease after 1 year, but not leukemia, suggesting that CREB contributes to but is not sufficient for leukemogenesis. Here, we show that CREB is most highly expressed in lineage negative hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). To understand the role of CREB in hematopoietic progenitors and leukemia cells, we examined the effects of RNA interference (RNAi) to knock down CREB expression in vitro and in vivo. Transduction of primary HSCs or myeloid leukemia cells with lentiviral CREB shRNAs resulted in decreased proliferation of stem cells, cell- cycle abnormalities, and inhibition of CREB transcription. Mice that received transplants of bone marrow transduced with CREB shRNA had decreased committed progenitors compared with control mice. Mice injected with Ba/F3 cells expressing either Bcr-Abl wild-type or T315I mutation with CREB shRNA had delayed leukemic infiltration by bioluminescence imaging and prolonged median survival.

Expression of the AML1-ETO (AE) fusion protein alone is not sufficient to induce leukemia, but the nature of the additional genetic alterations is unknown. It is unclear whether AE facilitates acquisition of these cooperating events. We show that AE down-regulates genes involved in multiple DNA repair pathways, potentially through a mechanism involving direct binding at promoter elements, and increases the mutation frequency in vivo. AE cells display increased DNA damage in vitro and have an activated p53 pathway. This results in increased basal apoptosis and enhanced sensitivity to DNA damaging agents. Intriguingly, microarray data indicate that t(8;21) patient samples exhibit decreased expression of DNA repair genes and increased expression of p53 response genes compared with other acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patient samples. Inhibition of the p53 pathway by RNAi increases the resistance of AE cells to DNA damage. We thus speculate that AML1-ETO may facilitate accumulation of genetic alterations by suppressing endogenous DNA repair. It is possible that the superior outcome of t(8;21) patients is partly due to an activated p53 pathway, and that loss of the p53 response pathway is associated with disease progression.","['Krejci, Ondrej', 'Wunderlich, Mark', 'Geiger, Hartmut', 'Chou, Fu-Sheng', 'Schleimer, David', 'Jansen, Michael', 'Andreassen, Paul R', 'Mulloy, James C']","['Krejci O', 'Wunderlich M', 'Geiger H', 'Chou FS', 'Schleimer D', 'Jansen M', 'Andreassen PR', 'Mulloy JC']","[""Division of Experimental Hematology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, OH 45226, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20071101,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (AML1-ETO fusion protein, human)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/blood', 'Antigens, CD34/blood', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Death/*physiology', 'Cell Division', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*genetics/metabolism', '*DNA Damage', 'DNA Repair/genetics', 'Fetal Blood/cytology', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics/metabolism', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/*physiology']",2007/11/03 09:00,2008/05/22 09:00,['2007/11/03 09:00'],"['2007/11/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/22 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)44617-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2007-06-093682 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2008 Feb 15;111(4):2190-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2007-06-093682.

The loss of IRF-8 in myeloid cells results in a chronic myelogenous leukemia-like syndrome, suggesting that IRF-8 behaves as a tumor suppressor gene in certain hematopoietic malignancies. We have been investigating the molecular determinants of solid tumor progression, with an emphasis on apoptotic resistance. Recently, we showed that IRF-8 expression was directly correlated with Fas-mediated apoptosis, and inversely related to malignant phenotype. However, the functional role of IRF-8 in solid tumors is unresolved. We stably silenced IRF-8 expression via RNA interference in IRF-8-expressing mouse tumor cells, and evaluated them for changes in apoptotic phenotype and malignant behavior. Apoptosis induced by Fas engagement or irradiation was markedly reduced in IRF-8-deficient tumor cells, despite unaltered proliferation, cell surface Fas, or MHC class I expression. Moreover, in syngeneic immunocompetent mice, IRF-8-deficient tumor cells grew more aggressively than their control counterparts. However, in IFN-gamma- or Fas ligand-deficient mice, but not T cell-deficient mice, both control and IRF-8-deficient tumor populations grew similarly. Furthermore, both tumor populations grew similarly in mice with defects in innate immunity. Although subsequent studies precluded a role for natural killer cells, immunohistochemical analysis supported the involvement of macrophages. Overall, our findings show that IRF-8 expression in solid tumor cells is important for efficient host immunosurveillance and response to apoptotic stimuli. Therefore, IRF-8 down-regulation may represent a previously unrecognized tumor escape mechanism that facilitates tumor progression. Conversely, strategies aimed at up-regulating or restoring IRF-8 expression in neoplastic cells may improve therapeutic efficacy.","['Greeneltch, Kristy M', 'Schneider, Monika', 'Steinberg, Seth M', 'Liewehr, David J', 'Stewart, Trina J', 'Liu, Kebin', 'Abrams, Scott I']","['Greeneltch KM', 'Schneider M', 'Steinberg SM', 'Liewehr DJ', 'Stewart TJ', 'Liu K', 'Abrams SI']","['Laboratory of Tumor Immunology and Biology, Biostatistics and Data Management Section, National Cancer Institute, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892-1402, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Interferon Regulatory Factors)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '0 (interferon regulatory factor-8)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Fas Ligand Protein/physiology', 'Female', 'Immunity, Innate', 'Interferon Regulatory Factors/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*physiology', 'Interferon-gamma/physiology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*immunology/pathology', 'Tumor Escape', 'fas Receptor/physiology']",2007/11/03 09:00,2007/12/06 09:00,['2007/11/03 09:00'],"['2007/11/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['67/21/10406 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-1228 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2007 Nov 1;67(21):10406-16. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-1228.,,['Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As a first step in determining the mechanism(s) underlying this observation, we investigated the role of RT in mediating the active recruitment of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) to the site of RT. Our results show in a mouse model that local RT delivered to the left leg causes preferential accumulation of bone marrow mononuclear cells to the irradiated site, with maximum signal intensity observed at 7 days post-RT. This is associated with a 4-fold higher number of donor-derived HSC present in the left leg, demonstrating recruitment of HSC to the site of RT. SDF-1, matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2), and MMP-9 expression is significantly increased in the irradiated bone marrow, and their inhibition significantly reduced HSC recruitment to the irradiated bone marrow. Our data show that local RT has significant systemic effects by recruiting HSC to the irradiated bone marrow site, a process mediated by SDF-1, MMP-2, and MMP-9. These results raise the possibility that the exposure of increased numbers of HSC at a local site to fractionated irradiation may increase the risk of leukemogenesis.

An association between a transition of A --> G at position -290 of the 5'-regulatory region of the CYP 3A4 gene and an effect on the level of transcription has been reported. The CYP 3A4-G variant frequency varies substantially in different populations. In addition it has been demonstrated in association with several disease conditions, including clinical grades of prostate cancer, breast cancer, secondary leukemia, hypercholesterolemia and diabetes. We sought to determine the frequency distributions, in African American (AFAM) and Caucasian (CAU) populations as well as patients with multiple complex diseases, such as those that had undergone cardiac or renal transplantation. Sequence-specific primers and PCR were used to determine genotype variation in 206 AFAM and 108 CAU individuals. CYP 3A4-G genotype was present with a higher frequency in AFAM individuals as compared with CAU (83% vs. 3%, p < 0.0001, RR = 3.9). The homozygous AA allele was predominantly present in CAU (97%) but only 17% in AFAM (p < 0.0001, RR = 2.5). In contrast, the homozygous GG allele was only detected in AFAM group (14.6%). The frequency distribution of homozygous GG and AA alleles were inversely present in male vs. female patients with CTx or RTx. Pre-transplantation clinical conditions demonstrated that hypertension (HTN), hyperlipidemia and to a lesser extent diabetes (DM) were present in CTx and RTx patients with homozygous GG alleles. In addition, 75% of AFAM patients with homozygous GG genotype experienced multiple rejection episodes with severity grades of 3A after cardiac transplantation, and 31.5% of homozygous GG patients with RTx suffered from rejections (p < 0.05; RR = 2.4). In conclusion, CYP 3A4 genotype demonstrated a remarkable interindividual variation between AFAM and CAU populations, and furthermore CTx patients with homozygous GG genotype were at higher risk of developing rejection as compared with RTx patients. This indicates an underlying heterogeneity with regard to the disease characteristics as well as the therapy regimen.","['Zhou, Xinchun', 'Barber, W Henry', 'Moore, Charles K', 'Tee, Lee Y', 'Aru, Giorgio', 'Harrison, Sebron', 'Mangilog, Brenda', 'McDaniel, D Olga']","['Zhou X', 'Barber WH', 'Moore CK', 'Tee LY', 'Aru G', 'Harrison S', 'Mangilog B', 'McDaniel DO']","['Department of Surgery, The University of Mississippi Medical Center, Jackson, Mississippi 39216-4500, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Res Commun Mol Pathol Pharmacol,Research communications in molecular pathology and pharmacology,9437512,"['9035-51-2 (Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A)', 'EC 1.14.14.55 (CYP3A4 protein, human)']",IM,"['African Americans/genetics', 'Alleles', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System/*genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Frequency', 'Graft Rejection/*genetics/immunology', 'Heart Transplantation/*immunology', 'Heterozygote', 'Homozygote', 'Humans', 'Kidney Transplantation/*immunology', 'Male', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Sex Factors', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Whites/genetics']",2007/11/03 09:00,2007/12/06 09:00,['2007/11/03 09:00'],"['2007/11/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/03 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Res Commun Mol Pathol Pharmacol. 2006;119(1-6):89-104.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The role of bone marrow trephine biopsy (BMTB) histology and immunohistochemistry in the diagnosis of AML-MD is currently unclear. BMTBs were studied in 11 cases of AML-MD and two cases of myelodysplasia that subsequently transformed to AML. Among them, six cases showed trilineage dysplasia and seven showed bilineage dysplasia. With respect to conforming to the WHO definition of AML, documentation of an increased proportion of immature myeloid cells was possible on morphology and counting of immature cells following immunostaining with CD34, CD117 or HLA-DR antibodies. Recognition and quantification of dysplastic features in the haemopoietic lineages was made easier by immunohistochemistry with antibodies to ret40f (glycophorin C), myeloperoxidase, CD61 and/or CD42b, CD34, CD117 and HLA-DR. Based on this relatively small series of cases we show the utility of BMTB and immunohistochemistry as an aid to the diagnosis of AML-MD. This has to be seen not just in light of its utility at diagnosis, but also the role the diagnostic BMTB would play for purposes of comparison when follow-up BMTBs are submitted in this group of patients.","['Ngo, Nyethane', 'Lampert, Irvin A', 'Naresh, Kikkeri N']","['Ngo N', 'Lampert IA', 'Naresh KN']","['Department of Histopathology, Hammersmith Hospital & Imperial College, London, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20071031,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Biomarkers)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD34/analysis', 'Biomarkers/analysis', 'Biopsy/methods', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*pathology', 'Bone Marrow Examination/methods', 'Cytogenetics', 'Disease Progression', 'Erythroblasts/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Male', 'Megakaryocytes/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*pathology', 'Myeloid Cells/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/analysis']",2007/11/02 09:00,2008/05/03 09:00,['2007/11/02 09:00'],"['2007/11/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/03 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/02 09:00 [entrez]']","['BJH6882 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2007.06882.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2008 Feb;140(3):279-86. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2007.06882.x.

The oxidative clustered DNA lesions may be persistent and may accumulate in human cancer cells for long times after irradiation. To evaluate the detection and possible accumulation of oxidative clustered DNA lesions in leukemia cells exposed to doses equivalent to those used in radiotherapy, we measured the induction of DSBs and three different types of oxidative clustered DNA lesions in NALM-6 cells, a human acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) pre-B cell line, after exposure to (137)Cs gamma rays. For the detection and measurement of DSBs and oxidative clustered DNA lesions, we used an adaptation of the neutral comet assay (single-cell gel electrophoresis) using E. coli repair enzymes (Endo IV, Fpg and Endo III) as enzymatic probes. We found a linear dose response for the induction of DSBs and oxidative clustered DNA lesions. Clustered DNA lesions were more prevalent than prompt DSBs. For each DSB induced by radiation, approximately 2.5 oxidative clustered DNA lesions were detected. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate the detection and linear induction of oxidative clustered DNA lesions with radiation dose in an ALL cell line. These results point to the biological significance of clustered DNA lesions.","['Holt, Stewart M', 'Georgakilas, Alexandros G']","['Holt SM', 'Georgakilas AG']","['Biology Department, East Carolina University, Greenville, NC, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Radiat Res,Radiation research,0401245,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Child', '*DNA Damage', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*genetics/*radiation effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Gamma Rays', 'Humans', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Radiation Dosage']",2007/11/02 09:00,2007/12/14 09:00,['2007/11/02 09:00'],"['2007/01/24 00:00 [received]', '2007/05/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/11/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/14 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/02 09:00 [entrez]']","['RR0974 [pii]', '10.1667/RR0974.1 [doi]']",ppublish,Radiat Res. 2007 Nov;168(5):527-34. doi: 10.1667/RR0974.1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Antiproliferative activities of selected compounds were additionally evaluated against a panel of 12 tumor cell lines, including multi-drug-resistant phenotypes. All resistant cell lines were sensitive to these compounds. Concentration-dependent flow cytometric studies showed that KB/HeLa cells treated with selected compounds were arrested in the G2/M phases of the cell cycle.

However, treatment without CNS irradiation might also cause brain damage. PROCEDURE: Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was analyzed in 121 patients in an attempt to detect CNS injury. Seventy-three samples were analyzed for neuron-specific enolase (NSE), 108 for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAp), 110 for neurofilament protein light chain (NFp), and 70 for ascorbyl radical (AsR). Samples were taken at day 0, 8, 15, and 29 during induction treatment, including intrathecal MTX. Levels at days 8, 15, and 29 were compared with the levels before treatment. RESULTS: NSE levels were 9.0 (+/-3.5) microg/L (mean (+/-SD)) at day 0, 15.0 (+/-5.3) at day 8 (P < 0.001), 13.6 (+/-4.7) at day 15 (P < 0.001) and 11.1 (+/-4.3) at day 29 (P < 0.001). GFAp were 177 (+/-98) ng/L at day 0, 206 (+/-101) at day 8 (P < 0.001), 200 (+/-106) at day 15 (n.s.) and 228 (+/-137) at day 29 (P < 0.001).

At the Geneva cancer registry, we identified 4,397 patients diagnosed with invasive breast cancer between 1990 and 2004. Patients were followed up for leukemia until the end of 2005. Family history was categorized as positive in patients with >or=1 first- or second-degree relative with breast/ovarian cancer. We compared leukemia rates in patients with positive and negative family histories with those expected in the general population, generating standardized incidence ratios (SIRs). With Cox regression analysis, we calculated adjusted risks of secondary leukemia in patients with familial risks compared to those without it. Breast cancer patients had a significantly increased risk of secondary acute leukemia (SIR 3.2, 95% CI: 1.2-6.9) but not of chronic leukemia (SIR 1.6, 95% CI: 0.6-3.5). Among patients with a positive family history (n = 1.125, 25.6%), the SIRs were 5.7 (95% CI: 1.2-16.6) for acute and 5.2 (95% CI: 1.4-13.3) for chronic leukemia. Among breast cancer patients, family history was independently associated with leukemia [adjusted hazard ratio (HR(adj)) of 3.2, 95% CI: 1.1-9.2, among patient with vs. without family history]. The effect of family history was stronger for chronic leukemia (HR(adj): 11.6, 95% CI 1.3-104.7) than for acute leukemia (HR(adj) 1.6, 95% CI: 0.4-6.6). Breast cancer patients with a family history of breast/ovarian have an increased risk of secondary leukemia, both compared to the general population as well as to breast cancer patients without family histories. This excess risk is largely due to the increased risk of secondary chronic leukemia.","['Verkooijen, Helena M', 'Fioretta, Gerald', 'Rapiti, Elisabetta', 'Vlastos, Georges', 'Neyroud-Caspar, Isabelle', 'Chappuis, Pierre O', 'Bouchardy, Christine']","['Verkooijen HM', 'Fioretta G', 'Rapiti E', 'Vlastos G', 'Neyroud-Caspar I', 'Chappuis PO', 'Bouchardy C']","['Geneva Cancer Registry, Institute for Social and Preventive Medicine, Geneva University, Geneva, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,,IM,"['Aged', 'Breast Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*epidemiology', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Pedigree', 'Registries']",2007/11/02 09:00,2008/02/01 09:00,['2007/11/02 09:00'],"['2007/11/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/01 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/02 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.23212 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2008 Mar 1;122(5):1114-7. doi: 10.1002/ijc.23212.,,,,,,,,,,"['(c) 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite significant advances in the treatment of cancer, CLL remains incurable. The main feature of the disease is the generation of circulating B-cells with prolonged survival caused by aberrant apoptosis. In this study, we observe that valproic acid (VPA), a well-established histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, mediates apoptosis in CLL cells ex vivo through caspase activation via both the extrinsic and the intrinsic apoptosis pathways, as indicated by the activation of the caspase proteins 8 and 9, and cleavage of the proapoptotic protein BID. The Bcl-2/Bax ratio was decreased as a consequence of decreased bcl-2 mRNA levels in response to treatment with VPA. With the results presented in this study, we have identified the HDAC inhibitor VPA as restoring the apoptotic pathways in CLL cells and thus their ability to undergo apoptosis.","['Bokelmann, Imke', 'Mahlknecht, Ulrich']","['Bokelmann I', 'Mahlknecht U']","['Department of Hematology/Oncology, University of Heidelberg Medical Center, Im Neuenheimer Feld 410, Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Mol Med,"Molecular medicine (Cambridge, Mass.)",9501023,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '614OI1Z5WI (Valproic Acid)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/*metabolism', 'B-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein/metabolism', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Caspase 8/metabolism', 'Caspase 9/metabolism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitochondria/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Reference Values', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Valproic Acid/*pharmacology', 'bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein/metabolism', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism']",2007/11/02 09:00,2008/03/07 09:00,['2007/11/02 09:00'],"['2007/08/23 00:00 [received]', '2007/10/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/11/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/07 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/02 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.2119/2007-00084.Bokelmann [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Med. 2008 Jan-Feb;14(1-2):20-7. doi: 10.2119/2007-00084.Bokelmann.,,,,,PMC2047630,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The decision of myeloid progenitor cells to commit to differentiation depends on activation levels of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK), ERK1 and ERK2. Using the murine myeloid progenitor cell line FD-Fms, we show here that persistent activity of Src-family kinases (SFK) is necessary for FD-Fms cell differentiation to macrophages in response to M-CSF. Chemical inhibition of SFK blocked FD-Fms cell differentiation while it caused strong inhibition of the late phosphorylation of phospholipase C (PLC)-gamma2 and MAPK. The PLC inhibitor U73122, previously shown to block M-CSF-induced differentiation, strongly decreased long-term MAPK phosphorylation. Interestingly, inhibiting SFK with SU6656 or the MAPK kinases MEK with U0126 significantly impaired development of mononuclear phagocytes in cultures of mouse bone marrow cells stimulated with M-CSF. Collectively, results support a model in which SFK are required for sustained PLC activity and MAPK activation above threshold required for commitment of myeloid progenitors to macrophage differentiation.","['Bourgin-Hierle, C', 'Gobert-Gosse, S', 'Therier, J', 'Grasset, M-F', 'Mouchiroud, G']","['Bourgin-Hierle C', 'Gobert-Gosse S', 'Therier J', 'Grasset MF', 'Mouchiroud G']","['Centre de Genetique Moleculaire et Cellulaire, Universite de Lyon, UMR 5534, Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1, CNRS, Villeurbanne, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071101,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)', 'EC 3.1.4.3 (Phospholipase C gamma)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Macrophages/*cytology/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Myeloid Progenitor Cells/metabolism', 'Phospholipase C gamma/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Receptor, Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'src-Family Kinases/*physiology']",2007/11/02 09:00,2008/03/07 09:00,['2007/11/02 09:00'],"['2007/11/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/07 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/02 09:00 [entrez]']","['2404986 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2404986 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2008 Jan;22(1):161-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404986.

Three fusion negative cases each had a telomeric part of 12p terminating within intron 2 of ETV6, attached to sequences from 5q, 7p and 7q, respectively. Two fusion positive cases, with partial insertions of ETV6 into chromosome 21, also had a breakpoint in intron 2. Fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH), array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) and Molecular Copy-Number Counting (MCC) results were concordant for the T-cell case. Sequences downstream of TLX3 on chromosome 5 were deleted, leaving the intact gene closely apposed to the first two exons of ETV6 and its upstream promoter. qRT-PCR showed a significant upregulation of TLX3. In this study we provide the first incontrovertible evidence that the upstream promoter of ETV6 attached to the first two exons of the gene was responsible for the ectopic expression of a proto-oncogene that became abnormally close as the result of deletion and translocation.

This observation sparked studies on the function and clinical importance of these markers. In order to address their function adequately, an efficient and reliable method for gene transfer is needed. In this study, we compared efficiency and utility of different gene transfer techniques in CLL. Lenti-, retro- and adenoviral transduction did not yield appreciable numbers of marker gene enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) positive CLL cells, despite various prestimulation protocols. Efficient transgene expression was observed after nucleofection of CLL cells with plasmid DNA, at the expense of low survival rates. After optimization, electroporation of in vitro transcribed mRNA yielded up to 90% EGFP+CLL cells without affecting survival. Transgene expression remained detectable for at least 2 weeks after electroporation. Furthermore, we could demonstrate overexpression of ZAP70 and of a ZAP70-EGFP fusion protein after electroporation with ZAP70 or ZAP70-EGFP mRNA. We conclude that mRNA electroporation is a novel and straightforward method for highly efficient gene transfer in CLL. The application of this technique should facilitate functional studies on CLL cells, as well as clinical research.","['Van Bockstaele, F', 'Pede, V', 'Naessens, E', 'Van Coppernolle, S', 'Van Tendeloo, V', 'Verhasselt, B', 'Philippe, J']","['Van Bockstaele F', 'Pede V', 'Naessens E', 'Van Coppernolle S', 'Van Tendeloo V', 'Verhasselt B', 'Philippe J']","['Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071101,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)']",IM,"['Biomarkers', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Electroporation/*methods/standards', 'Gene Expression', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/*administration & dosage', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase/genetics']",2007/11/02 09:00,2008/03/28 09:00,['2007/11/02 09:00'],"['2007/11/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/28 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/02 09:00 [entrez]']","['2405007 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2405007 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2008 Feb;22(2):323-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2405007.

Two AML cell lines, U937 cells and HL-60 cells, and fresh leukemic cells from six AML patients with high alpha4-integrin expression exhibited CAM-DR to cytosine arabinoside (Ara C) through VLA-4-to-FN interaction, while fresh leukemic cells from two AML patients with low alpha4-integrin expression did not display CAM-DR to Ara C. FNIII14 impaired VLA-4-to-FN interaction and restored sensitivity to Ara C in the CAM-DR leukemic cells. In these CAM-DR leukemic cells, upregulation of Bcl-2, which was induced through the focal adhesion kinase/Akt signal pathway upon VLA-4-to-FN interaction, was inhibited by FNIII14 treatment. In a mouse model of minimal residual disease (MRD) in bone marrow, 100% survival was achieved by combining FNIII14 with Ara C, whereas Ara C alone prolonged survival only slightly. The myelosuppression induced by Ara C was not augmented by the combination of FNIII14 in mouse experiments. Thus, the combination of anticancer drugs and FNIII14 holds promise to eradicate MRD in bone marrow after chemotherapy.","['Matsunaga, T', 'Fukai, F', 'Miura, S', 'Nakane, Y', 'Owaki, T', 'Kodama, H', 'Tanaka, M', 'Nagaya, T', 'Takimoto, R', 'Takayama, T', 'Niitsu, Y']","['Matsunaga T', 'Fukai F', 'Miura S', 'Nakane Y', 'Owaki T', 'Kodama H', 'Tanaka M', 'Nagaya T', 'Takimoto R', 'Takayama T', 'Niitsu Y']","['Fourth Department of Internal Medicine, Sapporo Medical University, School of Medicine, Sapporo, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20071101,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Fibronectins)', '0 (Integrin beta1)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance/*drug effects', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Fibronectins/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Integrin beta1', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*drug therapy', 'Peptide Fragments/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2007/11/02 09:00,2008/03/28 09:00,['2007/11/02 09:00'],"['2007/11/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/28 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/02 09:00 [entrez]']","['2405017 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2405017 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2008 Feb;22(2):353-60. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2405017.

Transplantation with bone marrow hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) has been used for curative therapy for decades. More recently, alternative sources of HSC, particularly those induced to exit marrow or mobilize to peripheral blood by G-CSF, have become the most widely used hematopoietic graft and show significant superiority to marrow HSC. The chemokine/chemokine receptor axis also mobilizes HSC that occurs more rapidly than with G-CSF. In mice, the HSC and progenitor cells (HPC) mobilized by the CXCR2 receptor agonist GRObeta can be harvested within minutes of administration and show significantly lower levels of apoptosis, enhanced homing to marrow, expression of more activated integrin receptors and superior repopulation kinetics and more competitive engraftment than the equivalent cells mobilized by G-CSF. These characteristics suggest that chemokine axis-mobilized HSC represent a population of adult stem cells distinct from those mobilized by G-CSF, with superior therapeutic potential. It remains to be determined if the chemokine mobilization axis can be harnessed to mobilize other populations of unique adult stem cells with clinical utility.","['Pelus, L M', 'Fukuda, S']","['Pelus LM', 'Fukuda S']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN 46202, USA. lpelus@iupui.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",20071101,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Chemokine CXCL12)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL2)', '0 (Chemokines)', '0 (Receptors, Chemokine)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-8B)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Adult Stem Cells/classification/cytology/*drug effects', 'Animals', 'Chemokine CXCL12/physiology', 'Chemokine CXCL2/pharmacology', 'Chemokines/*pharmacology', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization/*methods', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/classification/cytology/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Mice', 'Mice, Congenic', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Radiation Chimera', 'Receptors, Chemokine/*agonists/physiology', 'Receptors, Interleukin-8B/agonists/drug effects']",2007/11/02 09:00,2008/03/28 09:00,['2007/11/02 09:00'],"['2007/11/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/28 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/02 09:00 [entrez]']","['2405021 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2405021 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2008 Mar;22(3):466-73. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2405021.

In our opinion SLVL is not a rare disease as it was thought; it should especially be taken into diagnostic consideration in elder patients, particularly in males with splenomegaly and lymphocytosis.","['Colovic, M', 'Jankovic, G', 'Colovic, R', 'Mijovic, A', 'Antunovic, P']","['Colovic M', 'Jankovic G', 'Colovic R', 'Mijovic A', 'Antunovic P']",,['srp'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,Serbia,Srp Arh Celok Lek,Srpski arhiv za celokupno lekarstvo,0027440,,IM,"['Aged', 'B-Lymphocytes/*pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Splenic Neoplasms/*diagnosis/pathology']",1994/03/01 00:00,2007/12/15 09:00,['1994/03/01 00:00'],"['1994/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/15 09:00 [medline]', '1994/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Srp Arh Celok Lek. 1994 Mar-Apr;122(3-4):103-4.,Silenicni limfom s cirkulisucim viloznim limfocitima.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, the results of conventional and molecular cytogenetic analyses and clinical outcomes of 66 AML patients of different subgroups aged between 16 and 82 were evaluated. Chromosomal abnormalities were detected in 17 (25.7%) patients cytogenetically at the time of diagnosis, whereas molecular cytogenetic abnormalities were detected in 21 (31.8%) patients by fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH). Thirty-eight (57.6%) patients had a normal karyotype. In 8 patients, we did not obtain suitable chromosomes for karyotype analysis and in 3 patients conventional cytogenetics were not requested by the physician. During clinical follow-up, 21 patients (31.8%) achieved complete remission (CR), 2 had partial remission (PR) (3.0%) and 4 patients had progressive disease (6.06%). Twenty-eight (42.4%) patients died during treatment and no follow-up data were available in 7 cases. Among patients with chromosome abnormalities detected by either one of the two cytogenetic methods (n=28), 12 had achieved CR, 9 of whom were already categorised in the good prognostic group with t(15;17), inv16 or t(8;21). As for the normal karyotype, each patient displayed a different clinical course, which is probably due to the molecular changes in leukaemia-related genes. Here we report our findings, which correlate with previous reports and conclude that cytogenetics is a crucial marker in leukaemia diagnosis and conventional and molecular cytogenetics should be performed as well as molecular genetic diagnostic methods.","['Sahin, F Iffet', 'Kizilkilic, E', 'Bulakbasi, T', 'Yilmaz, Z', 'Boga, C', 'Ozalp, O', 'Karakus, S', 'Ozdogu, H']","['Sahin FI', 'Kizilkilic E', 'Bulakbasi T', 'Yilmaz Z', 'Boga C', 'Ozalp O', 'Karakus S', 'Ozdogu H']","['Department of Medical Genetics, Faculty of Medicine, Baskent University, Kubilay Sokak No:36 Maltepe, 06570 Ankara, Turkey. feridesahin@hotmail.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20071003,Italy,Clin Exp Med,Clinical and experimental medicine,100973405,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cytogenetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Rate', 'Translocation, Genetic/*genetics', 'Treatment Outcome']",2007/11/01 09:00,2007/12/07 09:00,['2007/11/01 09:00'],"['2006/11/22 00:00 [received]', '2007/06/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/11/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/07 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/01 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s10238-007-0130-2 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Exp Med. 2007 Sep;7(3):102-7. doi: 10.1007/s10238-007-0130-2.

In this study, we demonstrate that BH3-only protein Noxa is upregulated during CPT-induced apoptosis, which is independent of p53. In addition, we show that phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathway is responsible for Noxa's induction. Luciferase assay and cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) knockdown experiments further demonstrate that CREB is involved in the transcriptional upregulation of Noxa. Moreover, blocking Noxa expression using specific small interfering ribonucleic acid (siRNA) significantly reduces the apoptosis in response to CPT, indicating that Noxa is an essential mediator for CPT-induced apoptosis. Interestingly, antiapoptotic Mcl-1 was also upregulated through PI3K/Akt signaling pathway upon CPT treatment. Using immunoprecipitation assay, Noxa was found to interact with Mcl-1 in the presence or absence of CPT. Knockdown of Mcl-1 expression by short hairpin ribonucleic acid (shRNA) was shown to potentiate CPT-induced apoptosis. Consistently, ectopic overexpression of Mcl-1 rescued cells from apoptosis induced by CPT. Cells coexpressing Noxa and Mcl-1 at different ratio correlates well with the extent of apoptosis, suggesting that the balance between Noxa and Mcl-1 may determine the susceptibility of HeLa cells to CPT-induced apoptosis.","['Mei, Yide', 'Xie, Chongwei', 'Xie, Wei', 'Tian, Xu', 'Li, Mei', 'Wu, Mian']","['Mei Y', 'Xie C', 'Xie W', 'Tian X', 'Li M', 'Wu M']","[""Hefei National Laboratory for Physical Sciences at Microscale and School of Life Sciences, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Neoplasia,"Neoplasia (New York, N.Y.)",100886622,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (PMAIP1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (CREB-Binding Protein)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'XT3Z54Z28A (Camptothecin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Blotting, Western', 'CREB-Binding Protein/drug effects/metabolism', 'Camptothecin/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/drug effects/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Up-Regulation']",2007/11/01 09:00,2007/12/28 09:00,['2007/11/01 09:00'],"['2007/07/12 00:00 [received]', '2007/08/26 00:00 [revised]', '2007/08/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/11/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/28 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/01 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1593/neo.07589 [doi]'],ppublish,Neoplasia. 2007 Oct;9(10):871-81. doi: 10.1593/neo.07589.,,,,,PMC2040214,,,,,,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['CREB', 'Mcl-1', 'Noxa', 'apoptosis', 'camptothecin']",,,,,

At the molecular level, the maturational activity of Nutlin-3 in HL-60 cells was accompanied by the induction of E2F1 transcription factor, and it was significantly counteracted by specific gene knockdown with small interfering RNA for E2F1. Moreover, Nutlin-3, as well as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha, potentiated the maturational activity of recombinant TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) in HL-60 cells. However, although TNF-alpha significantly counteracted the proapoptotic activity of TRAIL, Nutlin-3 did not interfere with the proapoptotic activity of TRAIL.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The Cancer and Leukemia Group B 39802 trial was a prospective, multi-institutional study designed to elucidate the technical feasibility of VATS in early non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) using a standard definition for VATS lobectomy (one 4- to 8-cm access and two 0.5-cm port incisions) that mandated videoscopic guidance and a traditional hilar dissection without rib spreading. Between 1998 and 2001, 128 patients with peripheral lung nodules < or = 3 cm in size with suspected NSCLC were prospectively registered for VATS lobectomy. RESULTS: One hundred twenty-seven patients (66 males and 61 females; median age, 66 years; range, 37 to 86 years), with a performance status of 0 (74%) or 1 (26%), underwent surgery. Patients with lymph nodes more than 1 cm by computed tomography scan underwent mediastinal lymph node sampling to rule out N2 disease. One hundred eleven patients (87%) had stage I lung cancer, and 96 (86.5%) of these 111 patients underwent successful VATS lobectomies. The median procedure length was 130 minutes (range, 47 to 428 minutes), and median chest tube duration was 3 days (range, 1 to 14 days). Fifty-eight (60%) of 97 patients underwent diagnostic biopsy at lobectomy. Within 30 days, three (2.7%) of 111 patient deaths occurred, none of which were directly related to VATS technique; seven (7.4%) of 95 patients had grade 3 or greater complications, with only one case of bleeding. CONCLUSION: A standardized approach to VATS lobectomy as specifically defined with avoidance of rib spreading is feasible.","['Swanson, Scott J', 'Herndon, James E 2nd', ""D'Amico, Thomas A"", 'Demmy, Todd L', 'McKenna, Robert J Jr', 'Green, Mark R', 'Sugarbaker, David J']","['Swanson SJ', 'Herndon JE 2nd', ""D'Amico TA"", 'Demmy TL', 'McKenna RJ Jr', 'Green MR', 'Sugarbaker DJ']","['Surgery Committee of the Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB), Statistics Office of CALGB, and Respiratory Committee of CALGB, Chicago, IL, USA.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Cohorts of three to six patients received 200 or 260 mg/m2/d of temozolomide by mouth daily for 5 days every 28 days. Toxicities, clinical response, and pharmacokinetics were evaluated. Pretreatment leukemia cell O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) activity, tumor and plasma MGMT promoter methylation, and microsatellite instability (MSI) were examined in 14 of 16 study patients and in tissue bank samples from children with acute leukemia not treated with temozolomide (MGMT, n = 67; MSI, n = 65). RESULTS: Sixteen patients (nine female, seven male; acute lymphoblastic leukemia [ALL], n = 8; acute myeloid leukemia [AML], n = 8), median age 11 years (range, 1 to 19 years), received either 200 mg/m2/d (nine enrolled, three assessable for toxicity) or 260 mg/m2/d (seven enrolled, three assessable for toxicity) of temozolomide. Temozolomide was well tolerated and no dose-limiting toxicities occurred. The mean clearance of temozolomide was 107 mL/min/m2, with a volume of distribution of 20 L/m2 and half-life of 109 minutes. MGMT activity in leukemia cells was quite variable and was highest in patients with relapsed ALL. Only one patient had MSI. Two patients had a partial response. Both of these patients had no detectable MGMT activity; both also had methylated MGMT promoters and were MSI stable. CONCLUSION: Temozolomide was well tolerated at doses as high as 260 mg/m2/d for 5 days in children with relapsed or refractory leukemia. Increased MGMT activity may account for the temozolomide resistance in children with relapsed leukemia.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 1996 and 2000, 164 children with standard-risk ALL treated on Dana-Farber Cancer Institute Consortium Protocol 95-01 were randomly assigned to receive either 18 Gy CRT delivered in twice daily fractions (0.9 [DOSAGE ERROR CORRECTED] Gy) with double IT therapy (methotrexate and cytarabine) or intensive triple IT drug (methotrexate, cytarabine and hydrocortisone) without CRT. Neuropsychological testing was completed at a median 6 years postdiagnosis for 79 children (CRT, n = 39; triple IT, n = 40), all of whom were in continuous complete remission. RESULTS: Cognitive function for both groups was solidly in the average range, with no consistent group differences in basic cognitive skills. Children treated on the CRT plus double IT arm did, however, exhibit less fluent output and were less effective at modulating their behavior by parent report. CONCLUSION: This randomized trial revealed only subtle differences 6 years after diagnosis between children who received CNS therapy as CRT plus double IT drug or as intensive triple IT drug. In most situations where comparable therapeutic efficacy can be achieved without CRT, it is preferable to do so. Where therapeutically necessary, however, CRT at lower doses may not add risk for significant neurotoxicity.","['Waber, Deborah P', 'Turek, Jennifer', 'Catania, Lori', 'Stevenson, Kristen', 'Robaey, Philippe', 'Romero, Ivonne', 'Adams, Heather', 'Alyman, Cheryl', 'Jandet-Brunet, Christine', 'Neuberg, Donna S', 'Sallan, Stephen E', 'Silverman, Lewis B']","['Waber DP', 'Turek J', 'Catania L', 'Stevenson K', 'Robaey P', 'Romero I', 'Adams H', 'Alyman C', 'Jandet-Brunet C', 'Neuberg DS', 'Sallan SE', 'Silverman LB']","[""Division of Psychology, Department of Psychiatry, Children's Hospital, Boston, MA 02115, USA. deborah.waber@childrens.harvard.edu""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Glucocorticoids)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'WI4X0X7BPJ (Hydrocortisone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Central Nervous System Diseases/*diagnosis/etiology', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/drug therapy/radiotherapy/*therapy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cranial Irradiation/*adverse effects', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Glucocorticoids/administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Hydrocortisone/administration & dosage', 'Infant', 'Injections, Spinal', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/radiotherapy/*therapy']",2007/11/01 09:00,2007/12/06 09:00,['2007/11/01 09:00'],"['2007/11/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['25/31/4914 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2007.10.8464 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2007 Nov 1;25(31):4914-21. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2007.10.8464.,,,,"['J Clin Oncol. 2008 Feb 1;26(4):694.

Patients with relapsed or resistant CLL have a significantly shortened lifespan. MDM2 inhibitors have been developed and may have significant potential in the treatment of CLL. Clinical development of these compounds would be aided through knowledge of molecular predictors of activity. To understand determinants of sensitivity or resistance to MDM2 inhibitor therapy in CLL, we comprehensively analyzed a large cohort of CLL patient-derived samples for response to MDM2 inhibition and correlated these responses with clinically important biomarkers. Furthermore, we employed high-density single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays to analyze genomewide changes of copy number and allele status, including that of p53. The results of these studies conclusively demonstrate that p53 status is the major determinant of response to MDM2 inhibitors in CLL. Additional defects in the p53 regulatory cascade do not appear operational in this leukemia. Further, we identify a novel subgroup of patients with CLL with early progressive disease that appears particularly sensitive to MDM2 inhibitor treatment. These data provide definitive evidence for target-specific and predictive activity and a rationale to proceed with this potentially important class of compounds in the treatment of CLL.","['Saddler, Chris', 'Ouillette, Peter', 'Kujawski, Lisa', 'Shangary, Sanjeev', 'Talpaz, Moshe', 'Kaminski, Mark', 'Erba, Harry', 'Shedden, Kerby', 'Wang, Shaomeng', 'Malek, Sami N']","['Saddler C', 'Ouillette P', 'Kujawski L', 'Shangary S', 'Talpaz M', 'Kaminski M', 'Erba H', 'Shedden K', 'Wang S', 'Malek SN']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology and Oncology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor MI 48109-0936, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071030,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (MDM2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Alleles', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17/genetics', 'Cohort Studies', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Gene Dosage/genetics', 'Genome, Human/*genetics', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Loss of Heterozygosity/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*genetics/*metabolism']",2007/11/01 09:00,2008/03/28 09:00,['2007/11/01 09:00'],"['2007/11/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/28 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)45416-3 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2007-09-112698 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2008 Feb 1;111(3):1584-93. doi: 10.1182/blood-2007-09-112698.

To identify chromosomal changes cooperating with +21 that may provide information on the pathogenesis of these leukemias, we analyzed 215 DS-ALLs and 189 DS-AMLs. Unlike previous smaller series, a significant proportion of DS-ALLs had the typical B-cell precursor ALL abnormalities high hyperdiploidy (HeH; 11%) and t(12;21)(p13;q22) (10%). The HeH DS-ALLs were characterized by gains of the same chromosomes as non-DS-HeH, suggesting the same etiology/pathogenesis. In addition, specific genetic subtypes of DS-ALL were suggested by the significant overrepresentation of cases with +X, t(8;14)(q11;q32), and del(9p). Unlike DS-ALL, the common translocations associated with non-DS-AML were rare in DS-AML, which instead were characterized by the frequent presence of dup(1q), del(6q), del(7p), dup(7q), +8, +11, del(16q), and +21. This series of DS leukemias-the largest to date-reveals that DS-ALL is a heterogeneous disorder that comprises both t(12;21) and HeH as well as DS-related abnormalities. Furthermore, this analysis confirms that DS-AML is a distinct entity, originating through other genetic pathways than do non-DS-AMLs, and suggests that unbalanced changes such as dup(1q), +8, and +21 are involved in the leukemogenic process.","['Forestier, Erik', 'Izraeli, Shai', 'Beverloo, Berna', 'Haas, Oskar', 'Pession, Andrea', 'Michalova, Kyra', 'Stark, Batia', 'Harrison, Christine J', 'Teigler-Schlegel, Andrea', 'Johansson, Bertil']","['Forestier E', 'Izraeli S', 'Beverloo B', 'Haas O', 'Pession A', 'Michalova K', 'Stark B', 'Harrison CJ', 'Teigler-Schlegel A', 'Johansson B']","['Pediatrics Unit, Department of Clinical Sciences, University of Umea, Umea, Sweden. erik.forestier@pediatri.umu.se']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071030,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosome Aberrations/classification', 'Chromosomes, Human/genetics', 'Cytogenetics', 'Down Syndrome/*complications/epidemiology/*genetics', 'Female', 'Genome, Human/genetics', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications/epidemiology/*genetics', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications/epidemiology/*genetics']",2007/11/01 09:00,2008/03/28 09:00,['2007/11/01 09:00'],"['2007/11/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/28 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)45415-1 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2007-09-114231 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2008 Feb 1;111(3):1575-83. doi: 10.1182/blood-2007-09-114231.

Flow cytometry might add significantly to diagnostic and prognostic criteria. Our analysis of bone marrow samples from 50 patients with MDS showed aberrant expression of differentiation antigens in the myelomonocytic lineage. This also accounted for refractory anemia (RA) with or without ringed sideroblasts (RS), indicating multilineage dysplasia. In 38% of patients, CD34(+) myeloid blasts expressed CD5, CD7, or CD56. Flow cytometry data were translated into a numerical MDS flow-score. Flow-scores increased significantly from RA with or without RS, refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia (RCMD) with or without RS up to refractory anemia with excess of blasts-1 (RAEB-1) and RAEB-2. No significant differences were observed between WHO cytogenetic subgroups. Flow-scores were highly heterogeneous within International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) subgroups. Patients in progression to advanced MDS or acute myeloid leukemia had a significantly higher flow-score compared with non-transfusion-dependent patients. In 60% of patients with transfusion dependency or progressive disease, myeloid blasts expressed CD7 or CD56, in contrast to only 9% of non-transfusion-dependent patients. Moreover, all patients with pure RA with or without RS with aberrant myeloid blasts showed an adverse clinical course. In conclusion, flow cytometry in MDS identified aberrancies in the myelomonocytic lineage not otherwise determined by cytomorphology. In addition, flow cytometry identified patients at risk for transfusion dependency and/or progressive disease independent of known risk groups, which might have impact on treatment decisions and the prognostic scoring system in the near future.","['van de Loosdrecht, Arjan A', 'Westers, Theresia M', 'Westra, August H', 'Drager, Angelika M', 'van der Velden, Vincent H J', 'Ossenkoppele, Gert J']","['van de Loosdrecht AA', 'Westers TM', 'Westra AH', 'Drager AM', 'van der Velden VH', 'Ossenkoppele GJ']","['Department of Hematology, Vrije Universiteit (VU) University Medical Center, VU-Institute for Cancer and Immunology, Amsterdam, The Netherlands. a.vandeloosdrecht@vumc.nl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071030,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/immunology', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology', 'Cell Lineage', 'Disease Progression', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', 'Granulocytes/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Lymphoid Progenitor Cells/immunology', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*classification/*diagnosis/immunology', 'Myeloid Progenitor Cells/immunology', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Factors', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'World Health Organization']",2007/11/01 09:00,2008/03/28 09:00,['2007/11/01 09:00'],"['2007/11/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/28 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)45351-0 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2007-07-098764 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2008 Feb 1;111(3):1067-77. doi: 10.1182/blood-2007-07-098764.

Evidence has been presented in the literature to suggest that the synchronous presentation of colorectal cancer and B cell CLL may be more than simply coincidental for these two common malignancies. We report an unusual case of a presumed B cell CLL diagnosed on the basis of histological analysis of lymph nodes recovered from a resection specimen for rectal adenocarcinoma. We considered aetiological factors which may have linked the synchronous diagnosis of the two malignancies and the potential implications for the natural history of the two malignancies on one another. CASE PRESENTATION: A 70-year-old male underwent low anterior resection with total mesorectal excision for a rectal adenocarcinoma. His co-morbid conditions were chronic obstructive airways disease and ischaemic heart disease. General examination revealed no lymphadenopathy. Full blood count, urea and electrolytes and liver function tests were all within normal limits. As well as confirming a pT3 N1 adenocarcinoma, histological analysis showed lymph nodes with an infiltrate of small lymphoid cells. Immunohistochemical studies showed these cells to be in keeping with B cell CLL. CONCLUSION: Whilst unable to identify any common aetiological factors in the two malignancies in our patient, immunosuppression and genetic abnormalities have been identified as possible bases for an observed epidemiological association between colorectal cancer and haematological malignancies. Examples such as our case of synchronous diagnosis of two malignancies in a patient are likely to increase with the aging population. The potential affects of one malignancy on the natural history of the other warrants further study. In our case, we considered that slow progression of the B cell CLL may increase the risk of recurrent rectal adenocarcinoma.","['Dennis, Robert J', 'Alberts, Justin C']","['Dennis RJ', 'Alberts JC']","['Department General Surgery, West Suffolk Hospital, Hardwick Lane, Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk IP33 2QZ, UK. robertdennis@nhs.net']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20071030,England,World J Surg Oncol,World journal of surgical oncology,101170544,,IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/*pathology/surgery', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Biopsy, Needle', 'Colectomy/methods', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Incidental Findings', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/complications/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Male', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/complications/*pathology/*surgery', 'Rectal Neoplasms/*pathology/surgery', 'Risk Assessment', 'Treatment Outcome']",2007/11/01 09:00,2008/02/06 09:00,['2007/11/01 09:00'],"['2007/04/23 00:00 [received]', '2007/10/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/11/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['1477-7819-5-126 [pii]', '10.1186/1477-7819-5-126 [doi]']",epublish,World J Surg Oncol. 2007 Oct 30;5:126. doi: 10.1186/1477-7819-5-126.,,,,,PMC2169241,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, it is still controversial whether ATL cells are Treg cells. The aim of the present study was to investigate the Treg nature of ATL cells obtained from peripheral blood and skin tumors in terms of their phenotype and function. By flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry, the expression of the Treg-associated molecule cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen (CTLA)-4 and Foxp3 was examined in freshly isolated circulating and skin-infiltrating tumor cells from 21 ATL patients with skin eruptions. The expression of CTLA-4 on freshly isolated circulating tumor cells was elevated in two of 15 patients, and Foxp3 was expressed intracytoplasmically at high levels in three of nine patients. In five of the patients examined, skin-infiltrating tumor cells bore variously elevated CTLA-4 with high Foxp3 expression. The potentiality of ATL cells as Treg cells was further addressed by stimulating ATL cells with anti-CD3/CD28 monoclonal antibodies and monitoring CTLA-4 expression. With the stimulation, even CTLA-4-low ATL cells expressed higher levels of CTLA-4 than normal CD4(+)CD25(+) cells. To study function, ATL cells isolated from blood and skin tumors were tested for their ability to suppress the proliferation of autologous CD8(+) T cells stimulated with allogeneic lymphocytes. Despite the expression of CTLA-4 and Foxp3, these tumors were incapable of suppressing the proliferation of autologous CD8(+) T cells. ATL cells are phenotypically Treg cells in at least some patients, but lack immunoregulatory functions, at least toward CD8(+) T cells.","['Shimauchi, Takatoshi', 'Kabashima, Kenji', 'Tokura, Yoshiki']","['Shimauchi T', 'Kabashima K', 'Tokura Y']","['Department of Dermatology, University of Occupational and Environmental Health, 1-1, Iseigaoka, Yahatanishi-ku, Kitakyusyu 807-8555, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071025,England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (CD28 Antigens)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (CTLA-4 Antigen)', '0 (CTLA4 protein, human)', '0 (FOXP3 protein, human)', '0 (Forkhead Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology/pharmacology', 'Antigens, CD/*biosynthesis/immunology', 'Antigens, Differentiation/*biosynthesis/immunology', 'CD28 Antigens/immunology', 'CD3 Complex/immunology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'CTLA-4 Antigen', 'Female', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors/*biosynthesis/immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/blood/*immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Skin Neoplasms/blood/*immunology/pathology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/immunology']",2007/11/01 09:00,2008/02/19 09:00,['2007/11/01 09:00'],"['2007/11/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/19 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['CAS646 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1349-7006.2007.00646.x [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2008 Jan;99(1):98-106. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.2007.00646.x.

Two monoclonal antibodies, alemtuzumab and rituximab, have been extensively studied, as monotherapy or in combination, in patients with various clinical stages of CLL. Alemtuzumab, particularly when combined with fludarabine-based chemotherapy, sequentially or concomitantly, represents a promising therapeutic approach that results in improved efficacy by further reducing levels of residual disease in previously untreated or relapsed/refractory CLL. On the other hand, single-agent rituximab has limited activity by itself, even at very high doses, and seldom induces complete remissions. However, rituximab is feasible to combine with conventional chemotherapies such as purine analogs, alkylating chemotherapy and/or alemtuzumab. Newer monoclonal antibodies are already showing activity in relapsed/refractory CLL and will eventually be evaluated in combinations with conventional chemotherapy, or with already established antibodies. Modern definitions for assessment of responses such as minimal residual disease negativity (MRD negativity) are emerging and, consequently, development of assays capable of measuring such responses. MRD negativity should become the primary objective of clinical trials when evaluating treatment interventions in patients with CLL. The future of monoclonal antibodies for treatment of CLL is bright.","['Kharfan-Dabaja, Mohamed A', 'Fahed, Rabih', 'Hussein, Mohamad', 'Santos, Edgardo S']","['Kharfan-Dabaja MA', 'Fahed R', 'Hussein M', 'Santos ES']","['H.

This constitutively active tyrosine kinase promotes cell division and blocks apoptosis, leading to unregulated growth of hematopoietic stem cells. Imatinib is a small molecule that binds to BCR-ABL at the site in which adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binds and blocks BCR-ABL function by blocking its ability to use ATP. As a front-line therapy, imatinib has been tremendously successful, with 80% to 90% of patients with chronic phase (CP) CML remaining progression free for more than 5 years. Increasingly, however, imatinib-resistant clones are appearing that allow the disease to progress. dealing with the rise of these resistant clones has presented an important challenge to health care providers. OBJECTIVE: To review the mechanisms by which CML becomes resistant to imatinib and to discuss the new therapeutic alternatives to imatinib and when they should be considered. SUMMARY: Managed care weighs advances and associated costs to determine the introduction of imatinib has indefinitely lengthened the survival time of patients with CML, transforming this into a chronic disease condition. However, care must be taken to avoid the appearance of imatinib- resistant clones. resistance can manifest through 1 of several mechanisms, including increased plasma protein binding, increased drug efflux, the appearance of BCR-ABL mutants that have low affinity for imatinib, the appearance of BCR-ABL independent proliferation signals, and the amplification of the BCR-ABL gene. Subtherapeutic dosing is highly likely to result in the selection of a resistant clone; thus, it is of paramount importance to ensure the imatinib dose is sufficient. Measurements of plasma levels of imatinib are proving to be predictive of outcomes, suggesting that the monitoring of imatinib levels will be an important and necessary aspect of monitoring disease. Several clinical trials have shown that high-dose imatinib provides greater and faster response rates. This also may lead to better long-term blockade of disease progression. waiting until disease progression begins appears to lead to greater resistance to high-dose imatinib and should be avoided. dasatinib is a next-generation kinase inhibitor that binds to both SrC and to multiple conformations of BCR-ABL. It is capable of blocking several BCR-ABL mutants that are resistant to imatinib. Clinical trials have shown dasatinib is effective in maintaining patients in CP and can return a percentage of patients with advanced CML to CP. economic analysis indicates that the cost-efficacy ratio for imatinib is approximately $40,000 per year and compares favorably with the costs of accepted procedures, such as dialysis. data have shown that tyrosine kinases also have better mortality rates than allogeneic bone marrow transplant for the first 8 years and appear to also be more cost-effective than transplantation for this time frame. CONCLUSION: New clinical data are beginning to supply us with effective dosing and monitoring parameters for imatinib and dasatinib treatment of CML. economic analysis indicates that these therapies are acceptable in cost and effective in providing good quality of life to patients.","['Frame, David']",['Frame D'],"['University of Michigan Health System, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,J Manag Care Pharm,Journal of managed care pharmacy : JMCP,9605854,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Dasatinib', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Health Care Costs', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Piperazines/blood/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/blood/*therapeutic use', 'Thiazoles/*therapeutic use']",2007/11/27 09:00,2008/01/11 09:00,['2007/11/27 09:00'],"['2007/11/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/11 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['2007(13)8: 13-17 [pii]', '10.18553/jmcp.2007.13.s8-a.13 [doi]']",ppublish,J Manag Care Pharm. 2007 Oct;13(8 Suppl A):13-7. doi: 10.18553/jmcp.2007.13.s8-a.13.,,,,,,,,26,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17970609,NLM,MEDLINE,20080110,20151119,1083-4087 (Print) 1083-4087 (Linking),13,8 Suppl A,2007 Oct,Targeted chronic myeloid leukemia therapy: seeking a cure.,8-12,"BACKGROUND: Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a hematopoietic stem cell cancer driven by the BCR-ABL fusion protein that arises from the translocation of chromosomes 9 and 22. The disease begins with an indolent chronic phase (CP) that can last for 3 to 5 years. If untreated, it progresses into accelerated phase (AP) and within a year, blast phase (BP). Survival at this point is less than 1 year. during disease progression, mutations and the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) appear (a process called clonal evolution). The only known curative therapy for CML is allogeneic bone marrow transplant (BMT). However, toxicity is formidable, with treatment- related mortality reported in the 30% range. Thus, effective therapy that maintains the patient with CML in CP with minimal toxicity is the goal for treatment of modern therapies. Because the preeminent mutation driving CML is BCr-ABL, therapies targeting BCR-ABL are the logical choice for disease-specific therapy. BCR-ABL inhibitors, such as imatinib, are proof that targeting specific genetic mutations associated with cancer yields a high degree of efficacy with minimal toxicity. OBJECTIVE: This review will outline the evolution of therapy in CML. Preimatinib and imatinib-based treatment strategies, clinical efficacy, and the mechanism of imatinib resistance will be discussed. SUMMARY: The discovery of the Ph and, subsequently, the identification of BCr-ABL revolutionized the treatment of CML. Cytoreductive chemotherapy, such as busulfan and hydroxyurea, was a mainstay of therapy to control white blood cell (WBC) counts; however, it did not modify the progression of the disease to AP and BP. The overall survival with CML ranges from 45 to 58 months in patients treated with cytoreductive therapy only. Treatment was advanced with the introduction of interferon (IFn ) immunotherapy in the 1980s. In some studies, IFn produced a complete hematologic response (CHR) in more than 50% of patients; however, its nonspecific immunostimulatory mechanism also produced severe flulike symptoms that limited tolerability. despite the significant toxicity, cost, and inconvenience of injecting IFN thrice weekly, median survival ranged from 60 to 89 months. Allogeneic BMT is the only known curative therapy for CML; however, treatment-related mortality from infection, bleeding, and graft versus host disease, age, and the availability of suitable donors limits its widespread use. Imatinib functions by competing with adenosine triphosphate (ATP) for binding to the BCr-ABL tyrosine kinase. In the absence of ATP, BCR-ABL is not able to activate downstream effector tyrosine kinase molecules that drive wBC proliferation. The International randomized Interferon versus STI571 clinical trial was the first to document the efficacy of imatinib as a first-line therapy for patients in CP. More than 90% of these patients had a CHr. Toxicities associated with this therapy are low. response in patients with advanced CML is less pronounced than in CP and is shorter lived, with less than 30% of patients achieving a CHR. For patients with CML in BP, the only viable therapy is to attempt a temporary reduction in disease burden with a salvage chemotherapy regimen, such as VAC (etoposide, cytarabine, and carboplatin). The goal of this induction chemotherapy is to induce a second remission; then the patient may be considered for allogeneic BMT. The main toxicities seen with imatinib therapy are myelosuppression, edema, and myalgia/arthralgia. In many cases, imatinib dosage can be briefly halted or lowered while the toxicity is managed. Imatinib resistance may develop at any time and inevitably leads to disease progression. resistance is usually caused by mutations within BCr-ABL, decreasing the affinity of imatinib binding. next-generation kinase inhibitors are focused on the ability to inhibit these mutated forms of BCR-ABL. CONCLUSION: For the majority of patients with CML in CP, the standard of care is to maintain the patient in CP with imatinib therapy. Clinical trials have been extraordinarily successful, with 5-year survival rates greater than 90%. Allogeneic BMT continues to be an option for those who cannot tolerate imatinib or when CML progresses on imatinib therapy.","['Fausel, Christopher']",['Fausel C'],"['Indiana University, Cancer Center, Indianapolis, IN, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,J Manag Care Pharm,Journal of managed care pharmacy : JMCP,9605854,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Piperazines/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/adverse effects/*therapeutic use']",2007/11/27 09:00,2008/01/11 09:00,['2007/11/27 09:00'],"['2007/11/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/11 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['2007(13)8: 8-12 [pii]', '10.18553/jmcp.2007.13.s8-a.8 [doi]']",ppublish,J Manag Care Pharm. 2007 Oct;13(8 Suppl A):8-12. doi: 10.18553/jmcp.2007.13.s8-a.8.,,,,,,,,14,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although it is estimated that 4,600 people will be diagnosed with CML in the United States in 2007, only 12% of those individuals will die from the disease. That low mortality rate is due to the availability and efficacy of the new kinase inhibitors that target the BCR-ABL oncogene and other targets to hold disease progression in check. OBJECTIVE: To review the molecular pathogenesis of CML, describe the clinical course of the disease, and explain the current application of cytogenetics and molecular testing for diagnosis and treatment. SUMMARY: CML is caused by the translocation of chromosomes 9 and 22 to create what is called the Philadelphia chromosome. This translocation removes a critical regulatory domain from the tyrosine kinase, ABL, such that its protein product is constitutively active. This means that the cell escapes the constraints of normal cell growth and proliferates uncontrollably. The modified protein is known as BCR-ABL, and it causes CML by phosphorylating numerous downstream proteins involved in the activation of cell division, among other functions. during the earliest phase of the disease, the chronic phase, kinase inhibitors that target BCR-ABL are effective in stopping disease progression. However, a minority of patients remain unresponsive to this therapy. Laboratory tests are thus of great importance for this disease. not only are they required for the diagnosis of CML, but during therapy they can establish the degree of response. That response, in turn, can supply the clinician with a good estimate of the prognosis for the patient. The tests used for CML include complete blood count (CBC) with platelets, cytogenetic analysis, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR). These tests vary in the difficulty of application and in the sensitivity. CBC is commonplace within the average hospital laboratory, whereas cytogenetic analysis, FISH, and PCR require specialized equipment, personnel, and training. Hematologic counts are the least sensitive measures of disease, with a limit of detection of a leukemic burden of 1011 cells. Cytogenetics can detect a burden of 109 cells. Finally, quantitative PCr can detect a burden of as few as 105 leukemic cells. The current costs of these tests range from approximately $375 to $1,500 and must be performed every 3 to 6 months to follow the patient's response to therapy. CONCLUSION: The advent of kinase inhibitor therapy for CML has greatly increased the importance of sensitive analysis of disease burden. Subsequent testing during therapy greatly improves the ability of the clinician to predict the therapeutic outcome. Signs of early treatment failure can give the patient time to switch therapies before the disease progresses to an advanced stage.","['Sessions, Jolynn']",['Sessions J'],"['Emory University Hospital, Atlanta, GA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,J Manag Care Pharm,Journal of managed care pharmacy : JMCP,9605854,,IM,"['Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis/*genetics/therapy', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2007/11/27 09:00,2008/01/11 09:00,['2007/11/27 09:00'],"['2007/11/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/11 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['2007(13)8: 4-7 [pii]', '10.18553/jmcp.2007.13.s8-a.4 [doi]']",ppublish,J Manag Care Pharm. 2007 Oct;13(8 Suppl A):4-7. doi: 10.18553/jmcp.2007.13.s8-a.4.,,,,,,,,12,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because MTHFR is a key enzyme in folate metabolism, changes in its activity resulting from polymorphisms in the MTHFR gene could modify the susceptibility to cancer.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The association between MTHFR polymorphisms and susceptibility and clinical outcome in ALL was studied in 118 adult ALL patients and matched healthy controls (n =427). DNA samples taken from patients with ALL and controls were analyzed using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) assays to detect the MTHFR C677T and A1298C mutations. RESULTS: No significant difference was found in the development of adult ALL among those with different MTHFR genotypes of the C677T or A1298C polymorphisms.

Because mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) requires more than depolarization, antitumor TTs were tested for their ability to directly trigger specific markers of MPT in isolated mitochondria. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Large amplitude swelling and Ca2+ release were assayed in isolated mitochondria to demonstrate TT-induced MPT. RESULTS: Antitumor TTs interact with isolated mitochondria in a concentration- and time-dependent manner to rapidly cause large amplitude swelling and Ca2+ release in relation with their antiproliferative activities in L1210, HL-60 and LL/2 tumor cells in vitro. The ability of 4-10 uM TT15, TT16 and TT24 to maximally induce mitochondrial swelling and Ca2+ release within 20 min is similar to that of classic MPT inducers, such as 5 microg/ml alamethicin, 200 microM atractyloside, 5 microM phenylarsine oxide, 100 microM arsenic trioxide and a 100 microM Ca2+ overload. TT15 requires a priming concentration of 20 microM Ca2+ to trigger mitochondrial swelling and Ca2+ release and these 0.1 microM ruthenium red-sensitive MPT events are abolished by 1 microM cyclosporin A, 2 mM ADP and 20 microM bongkrekic acid, which block components of the permeability transition pore (PTP), and by 50-100 microM of various ubiquinones, which interact with the quinone binding site of the PTP and raise the Ca2+ load required for PTP opening. CONCLUSION: Antitumor TTs that trigger MPT in isolated mitochondria might interact with components of the PTP to boost its Ca2+-sensitive transition from the closed to the open state and might be valuable to develop mitochondriotoxic drugs that directly activate early components of apoptosis.","['Perchellet, Elisabeth M', 'Wang, Yang', 'Lou, Kaiyan', 'Zhao, Huiping', 'Battina, Srinivas K', 'Hua, Duy H', 'Perchellet, Jean-Pierre H']","['Perchellet EM', 'Wang Y', 'Lou K', 'Zhao H', 'Battina SK', 'Hua DH', 'Perchellet JP']","['Anti-Cancer Drug Laboratory, Division of Biology, Ackert Hall, Kansas State University, Manhattan, KS 66506-4901, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",,Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Quinones)', '0 (triptycene bisquinone)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Carcinoma, Lewis Lung/drug therapy', 'Cell Growth Processes/drug effects', 'Cell Membrane Permeability/drug effects', 'Female', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mitochondria, Liver/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Mitochondrial Membranes/drug effects/metabolism', 'Quinones/*pharmacology']",2007/11/01 09:00,2007/12/06 09:00,['2007/11/01 09:00'],"['2007/11/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/01 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2007 Sep-Oct;27(5A):3259-71.,,"['R01 AG025500/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA86842/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'RR15563/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We sought to improve cordycepin efficacy using other, less toxic co-drugs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated the ability of hydroxyurea (HU) to enhance the effects of cordycepin against MOLT-4 leukemia cells with the MTT cell viability assay. We determined the relationship of the combination drug treatment with CalcuSyn statistical analysis program according to the Chou-Talalay method. RESULTS: HU (50 microg/ml) was found to reduce the IC50 of cordycepin from 100 microM to 0.3 microM, a reduction similar to that observed for deoxycoformycin. CalcuSyn analysis of the cordycepin/HU combination revealed the dose effect as synergistic. Further statistical analysis demonstrated a clear synergy between the two drugs at a range of dosages. CONCLUSION: HU was identified as a promising potential alternative for anti-cancer therapy with cordycepin, thus eliminating the need for the toxic deoxycoformycin.","['Wehbe-Janek, Hania', 'Shi, Qiang', 'Kearney, Christopher M']","['Wehbe-Janek H', 'Shi Q', 'Kearney CM']","['Department of Biology, Institute of Biomedical Studies, Center for Drug Discovery, Baylor University, One Bear Place # 97388, Waco, TX 76798, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (Deoxyadenosines)', 'GZ8VF4M2J8 (cordycepin)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Deoxyadenosines/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*drug therapy']",2007/11/01 09:00,2007/12/06 09:00,['2007/11/01 09:00'],"['2007/11/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/01 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2007 Sep-Oct;27(5A):3143-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, in Japan, more cases with concomitant malignant disease have also recently been reported. There is a particularly high risk of cancer occurring simultaneously in the lower rectum and the anal area. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two-hundred and eighty-six patients with CD had undergone surgery at this department, up to December, 2005. We studied malignant diseases concomitant with CD, based on empirical examples. RESULTS: Thirteen (4.5%) were cases concomitant with malignant disease: six patients had colorectal cancer, 1 had rectal carcinoid, 1 had stomach cancer, 1 had uterine cancer, 1 had thyroid cancer, 1 had skin cancer and 2 had acute leukemia. Regarding the seven cases other than colorectal cancer, they were all juvenile patients under the age of 50, except for the stomach cancer case (69 years of age). Among the 6 cases of colorectal cancer, 5 cases were anorectal cancer and 1 was lower rectal cancer. The average age was 42.8 years (30-54 years) and the average term from CD occurrence to cancer diagnosis was 208 months (69-387 months). The one case with lower rectal cancer was intramucosal cancer which did not recur after surgery. The five cases of anorectal cancer were advanced, with invasion of the adjacent organs and 2 of them were unresectable. Four cases were of the infiltrative type, and regarding the histological findings, 4 cases were cancer with mucous production and 1 case was a poorly-differentiated endocrine tumor. Four cases had a history of anal fistula, but there was no clear causal relationship. CONCLUSION: In Japan, prolonged CD cases have been increasing and more and more cases of malignant disease with concomitant CD have been reported. There is a particularly high risk of cancer occurring simultaneously in the lower rectum and the anal area. Therefore, careful observation, taking all appropriate diagnostic surveillance modalities into consideration, is thus believed to be important in order to achieve an early detection of such cancer.","['Higashi, Daijiro', 'Futami, Kitaro', 'Kawahara, Kazumasa', 'Kamitani, Takanori', 'Seki, Kastunori', 'Naritomi, Kazuya', 'Egawa, Yuji', 'Hirano, Kenji', 'Tamura, Tomoaki', 'Tomiyasu, Takashige', 'Ishibashi, Yukiko', 'Simomura, Tamostu', 'Nii, Kaori', 'Kinugasa, Tetsushi']","['Higashi D', 'Futami K', 'Kawahara K', 'Kamitani T', 'Seki K', 'Naritomi K', 'Egawa Y', 'Hirano K', 'Tamura T', 'Tomiyasu T', 'Ishibashi Y', 'Simomura T', 'Nii K', 'Kinugasa T']","['Department of Surgery, Fukuoka University Chikushi Hospital, Japan. daijiro@fukuoka-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/*complications', 'Crohn Disease/*complications', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Risk', 'Time Factors']",2007/11/01 09:00,2007/12/14 09:00,['2007/11/01 09:00'],"['2007/11/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/14 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/01 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2007 Nov-Dec;27(6A):3771-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We describe a patient who developed refractory ascites due to portal vein thrombosis following liver transplantation for Budd-Chiari syndrome in the setting of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria. Extensive portal vein thrombosis, dense abdominal adhesions, and portosystemic collaterals precluded the use of a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt or surgical portosystemic shunt to manage the patient's ascites. Splenic artery embolization to decrease portal hypertension was performed, and this resulted in complete resolution of ascites. This case demonstrates the successful use of splenic artery embolization to manage ascites due to portal vein thrombosis following liver transplantation.

Flow cytometry was used to quantify gammaH2AX (serine 139 phosphorylated form of histone H2AX) expression of antibody-stained cells as a marker for deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) DSBs one hour and 24 hours after magnetic field exposure. X-ray-treated cells were used as positive control. RESULTS: Neither exposure to the static magnetic field alone nor to the applied imaging sequences showed significant differences in gammaH2AX expression between exposed and sham-exposed cells. X-ray-treated cells as positive control showed a significant increase in gammaH2AX expression.

We generated virus stocks that contained different levels of virus-associated envelope proteins, purified them from gp70 that was not associated with the viruses, quantified their titers, and measured the efficiency with which they transduced NIH 3T3, TE671, and HeLa cells. As expected, titers increased monotonically with viral envelope protein number. Titers are measured using highly dilute virus, however, and are often not predictive of gene transfer when high doses of virus are used, as is done in gene therapy protocols. Interestingly, when we used high doses of virus, we observed significantly different trends: gene transfer increased, reached a maximum, and then declined sharply as the number of envelope proteins per virus increased. The highest levels of gene transfer occurred when cells were transduced with a moderate dose of virus that contained low levels of envelope protein. Our results indicate that transduction is inhibited when viruses that contain large numbers of envelope proteins are used. This is most likely because each virus, when it binds to a cell, delivers a large payload of envelope proteins that occupy or inactivate multiple virus receptors, reducing or eliminating the susceptibility of the cell to being transduced by additional viruses. The implications of our findings for the design of improved retroviral vectors for human gene therapy are discussed.","['Landazuri, Natalia', 'Le Doux, Joseph M']","['Landazuri N', 'Le Doux JM']","['The Wallace H.

HTLV-I is the causative agent of adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma and is associated with myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis, uveitis, polymyositis, synovitis, thyroiditis, and bronchoalveolar pneumonia. Since T-cell abnormalities are present in those infected with HTLV-I, the clinical problems might result from abnormal immune function or from direct leukemic or lymphomatous cell infiltration of tissues in the body.

We identified that the LAF4 gene on 2q11.2-12 was fused to the AML1 gene on 21q22 in a pediatric patient having T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) with t(2;21)(q11;q22) using the bubble PCR method for cDNA. The genomic break points were within intron 7 of AML1 and of LAF4, resulting in the in-frame fusion of exon 7 of AML1 and exon 8 of LAF4. The LAF4 gene is a member of the AF4/FMR2 family and was previously identified as a fusion partner of MLL in B-precursor ALL with t(2;11)(q11;q23), although AML1-LAF4 was in T-ALL. LAF4 is the first gene fused with both AML1 and MLL in acute leukemia. Almost all AML1 translocations except for TEL-AML1 are associated with myeloid leukemia; however, AML1-LAF4 was associated with T-ALL as well as AML1-FGA7 in t(4;21)(q28;q22). These findings provide new insight into the common mechanism of AML1 and MLL fusion proteins in the pathogenesis of ALL.

Here, we applied immunoprecipitation (IP) with a custom DNA tiling microarray containing many transcription factors important in development and cancer (for example homeotic genes; N=683 total genes) to explore the relationship between H3K9Me3 and other histone modifications with the differential expression of genes. Cancer cell lines derived from different tissues (2 leukemia, 2 medulloblastoma) were characterized with IP antibodies to H3K9Me3, H3K4 dimethylation (H3K4Me2) and H3K9 acetylation (H3K9Ac). MV4-11 is known to overexpress the HOXA9 and MEIS1 genes, whereas D283 overexpresses the OTX2 homeobox gene. Gene expression was assessed by Affymetrix U133 array. Mapping the number and size of histone markings demonstrated significant colocalization of H3K9Ac and H3K4Me2 with H3K9Me3, indicating a pattern of putative 'activating' and 'repressive' markings. The median site size was 600-821 bp and 72-95% or 53-80% of chromatin signal sites were located within 1 kb or 500 bp of transcription start sites (TSS), respectively. A relatively small number of genes displayed additional H3K9Me3 sites in the 5'-region distant from the TSS. Comparing genes with modification sites to those without sites in their promoters confirmed the positive associations of H3K9Ac and H3K4Me2 with gene expression and revealed that H3K9Me3 is associated with active genes rather than being a repressive marking as previously thought. The positive regulatory effect of all three types of modifications were quantitatively correlated with site size, and applied to absolute gene expression within a single cell line as well as relative expression among pairs of cell lines. Extended patterns of H3K9Me3 upstream of some genes (for example HOXA9 and OTX2) may result from the action of multiple promoter elements. We found an inverse relationship between promoter DNA hypermethylation and H3K9Me3 in three studied genes (HOXA9, TMS1, RASSF1A). The localization of H3K9Me3 downstream of the TSSs of expressed genes and not within promoter regions of hypermethylated and silenced genes is consistent with the proposed coupling of H3K9Me3 with RNA polymerase II. Our results indicate a need for revising aspects of the histone code involving H3 lysine methylation. Awareness of H3K9Me3 as a mark of gene activity, not repression, is especially important for the classification of human cancer using chromatin and histone profiles.","['Wiencke, J K', 'Zheng, S', 'Morrison, Z', 'Yeh, R-F']","['Wiencke JK', 'Zheng S', 'Morrison Z', 'Yeh RF']","['Laboratory of Neuro and Molecular Epidemiology, Ambulatory Care AC-34, Department of Neurological Surgery, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA. john.wiencke@ucsf.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20071029,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Histones)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (MEIS1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (OTX2 protein, human)', '0 (Otx Transcription Factors)', '0 (homeobox protein HOXA9)', 'K3Z4F929H6 (Lysine)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Methylation', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Histones/*metabolism', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics', 'Humans', 'Lysine/*metabolism', 'Methylation', 'Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics', 'Neoplasms/*genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Otx Transcription Factors/genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic/genetics']",2007/10/31 09:00,2008/05/02 09:00,['2007/10/31 09:00'],"['2007/10/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/02 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/31 09:00 [entrez]']","['1210895 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.onc.1210895 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2008 Apr 10;27(17):2412-21. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1210895.

Our aim was to determine if CLL tumors with a chromosome 11q deletion might be divided into two subgroups based on the status of the remaining ATM allele. METHODS: The sequence of the residual ATM allele was determined in 72 CLLs with an 11q deletion. This was related to the cellular response to irradiation or cytotoxic drug exposure in vitro and clinical outcome. RESULTS: We show that the residual ATM allele is mutated in 36% of CLLs with an 11q deletion and that these leukemias demonstrate an impaired cellular response to irradiation or cytotoxic drug exposure in vitro. Inactivation of the second ATM allele was associated with a reduction in patient survival beyond that already dictated by the presence of an 11q deletion (P = .0283). Furthermore, we demonstrate that ATM mutations may arise during the evolution of an 11q deleted subclone and are associated with its expansion. CONCLUSION: CLL with 11q deletion can be divided into two subgroups based on the integrity of the residual ATM allele. Patients with complete loss of ATM function, due to biallelic ATM defects, have defective responses to cytotoxic chemotherapeutics in vitro and a poorer clinical outcome. ATM mutant subclones can develop during an individual's disease course and give rise to additional expansion of the 11q deleted subclone.","['Austen, Belinda', 'Skowronska, Anna', 'Baker, Claire', 'Powell, Judith E', 'Gardiner, Anne', 'Oscier, David', 'Majid, Aneela', 'Dyer, Martin', 'Siebert, Reiner', 'Taylor, A Malcolm', 'Moss, Paul A', 'Stankovic, Tatjana']","['Austen B', 'Skowronska A', 'Baker C', 'Powell JE', 'Gardiner A', 'Oscier D', 'Majid A', 'Dyer M', 'Siebert R', 'Taylor AM', 'Moss PA', 'Stankovic T']","['Cancer Research UK Institute for Cancer Studies, University of Birmingham, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071029,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '18D0SL7309 (Chlorambucil)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (ATM protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Alleles', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Chlorambucil/therapeutic use', '*Chromosome Deletion', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'Cyclophosphamide/therapeutic use', 'DNA Breaks, Double-Stranded', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Gene Silencing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/enzymology/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*genetics/metabolism', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Vidarabine/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use']",2007/10/31 09:00,2007/12/14 09:00,['2007/10/31 09:00'],"['2007/10/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/14 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/31 09:00 [entrez]']","['JCO.2007.11.2649 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2007.11.2649 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2007 Dec 1;25(34):5448-57. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2007.11.2649.

To test the superiority of VCAP-AMP-VECP over biweekly cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP), we conducted a randomized controlled trial exclusively for ATLL. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Previously untreated patients with aggressive ATLL were assigned to receive either six courses of VCAP-AMP-VECP every 4 weeks or eight courses of biweekly CHOP. Both treatments were supported with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and intrathecal prophylaxis. RESULTS: A total of 118 patients were enrolled. The complete response (CR) rate was higher in the VCAP-AMP-VECP arm than in biweekly CHOP arm (40% v 25%, respectively; P = .020). Progression-free survival rate at 1 year was 28% in the VCAP-AMP-VECP arm compared with 16% in the CHOP arm (P = .100, two-sided P = .200). Overall survival (OS) at 3 years was 24% in the VCAP-AMP-VECP arm and 13% in the CHOP arm (P = .085, two-sided P = .169). For VCAP-AMP-VECP versus biweekly CHOP, grade 4 neutropenia, grade 4 thrombocytopenia, and grade 3 or 4 infection rates were 98% v 83%, 74% v 17%, and 32% v 15%, respectively. There were three toxic deaths in the VCAP-AMP-VECP arm. CONCLUSION: The longer OS at 3 years and higher CR rate with VCAP-AMP-VECP compared with biweekly CHOP suggest that VCAP-AMP-VECP might be a more effective regimen at the expense of higher toxicities, providing the basis for future investigations in the treatment of ATLL.","['Tsukasaki, Kunihiro', 'Utsunomiya, Atae', 'Fukuda, Haruhiko', 'Shibata, Taro', 'Fukushima, Takuya', 'Takatsuka, Yoshifusa', 'Ikeda, Shuichi', 'Masuda, Masato', 'Nagoshi, Haruhisa', 'Ueda, Ryuzo', 'Tamura, Kazuo', 'Sano, Masayuki', 'Momita, Saburo', 'Yamaguchi, Kazunari', 'Kawano, Fumio', 'Hanada, Shuichi', 'Tobinai, Kensei', 'Shimoyama, Masanori', 'Hotta, Tomomitsu', 'Tomonaga, Masao']","['Tsukasaki K', 'Utsunomiya A', 'Fukuda H', 'Shibata T', 'Fukushima T', 'Takatsuka Y', 'Ikeda S', 'Masuda M', 'Nagoshi H', 'Ueda R', 'Tamura K', 'Sano M', 'Momita S', 'Yamaguchi K', 'Kawano F', 'Hanada S', 'Tobinai K', 'Shimoyama M', 'Hotta T', 'Tomonaga M']","['Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Science, Nagasaki, Japan. tsukasak@net.nagasaki-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase III', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071029,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Nitrosourea Compounds)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'BG3F62OND5 (Carboplatin)', 'RYH2T97J77 (ranimustine)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'CHOP protocol']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Carboplatin/administration & dosage', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nitrosourea Compounds/administration & dosage', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Survival Rate', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",2007/10/31 09:00,2007/12/14 09:00,['2007/10/31 09:00'],"['2007/10/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/14 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/31 09:00 [entrez]']","['JCO.2007.11.9958 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2007.11.9958 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2007 Dec 1;25(34):5458-64. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2007.11.9958.

To test whether an activating mutation of FLT3 (FLT3-ITD) would cooperate with CBFbeta-SMMHC to promote AML, we coexpressed both mutations in hematopoietic progenitor cells used to reconstitute lethally irradiated mice. Analysis of transplanted animals showed strong selection for CBFbeta-SMMHC/FLT3-ITD-expressing cells in bone marrow and peripheral blood. Compared with animals transplanted with only CBFbeta-SMMHC-expressing cells, FLT3-ITD further restricted early myeloid differentiation and promoted peripheralization of primitive myeloblasts as early as 2.5 weeks after transplantation. FLT3-ITD also accelerated disease progression in all CBFbeta-SMMHC/FLT3-ITD-reconstituted animals, which died of a highly aggressive and transplantable AML within 3 to 5 months.

The few antiretrovirals that have been tested against HTLV-1 in vitro have already been developed into anti-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) drugs. Here, we show the effects of a newly synthesized family of phosphonated nucleoside compounds, phosphonated carbocyclic 2'-oxa-3'-aza-nucleosides (PCOANs), on HTLV-1 infection in vitro. To ascertain the anti-HTLV-1 activity of PCOANs, peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy donors were infected in vitro by coculture with an HTLV-1 donor cell line in the presence of three prototype PCOAN compounds. PCOANs were able to completely inhibit HTLV-1 infection in vitro at a concentration of 1 microM, similar to what has been observed for tenofovir and azidothymidine. Treatment with PCOANs was associated with inhibited growth of HTLV-1-infected cells, and their effects were 100 to 200 times more potent than that of tenofovir. The mechanisms involved in the anti-HTLV-1 effects of PCOANs can mainly be ascribed to their capacity to inhibit HTLV-1 reverse transcriptase activity, as ascertained by means of a cell-free assay. PCOANs caused little reduction in proliferation or induction of apoptotic cell death of uninfected cells, showing toxicity levels similar to tenofovir and lower than azidothymidine. Overall, these results indicate that the family of PCOANs includes potential candidate compounds for long-lasting control of HTLV-1 infection.","['Balestrieri, Emanuela', 'Matteucci, Claudia', 'Ascolani, Arianna', 'Piperno, Anna', 'Romeo, Roberto', 'Romeo, Giovanni', 'Chiacchio, Ugo', 'Mastino, Antonio', 'Macchi, Beatrice']","['Balestrieri E', 'Matteucci C', 'Ascolani A', 'Piperno A', 'Romeo R', 'Romeo G', 'Chiacchio U', 'Mastino A', 'Macchi B']","['Department of Experimental Medicine, University of Rome Tor Vergata, Via Montpellier 1, 00135 Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071029,United States,Antimicrob Agents Chemother,Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,0315061,"['0 (Anti-Retroviral Agents)', '0 (Aza Compounds)', '0 (Nucleosides)', '0 (Organophosphonates)', '0 (Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors)']",IM,"['Anti-Retroviral Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Aza Compounds/chemistry/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Cell Line', 'HTLV-I Infections/virology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*drug effects/enzymology/pathogenicity', 'Humans', '*Leukocytes, Mononuclear/drug effects/physiology/virology', 'Nucleosides/chemistry/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Organophosphonates/chemistry/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors/chemistry/pharmacology/toxicity', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",2007/10/31 09:00,2008/05/07 09:00,['2007/10/31 09:00'],"['2007/10/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/07 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/31 09:00 [entrez]']","['AAC.00470-07 [pii]', '10.1128/AAC.00470-07 [doi]']",ppublish,Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2008 Jan;52(1):54-64. doi: 10.1128/AAC.00470-07.

However, little is known about how MLF1 functions upstream of the CSN3-COP1-p53 pathway and how its deregulation by the formation of the fusion protein nucleophosmin (NPM)-MLF1, generated by t(3;5)(q25.1;q34) chromosomal translocation, leads to leukemogenesis. Here we show that MLF1 is a cytoplasmic-nuclear-shuttling protein and that its nucleolar localization on fusing with NPM prevents the full induction of p53 by both genotoxic and oncogenic cellular stress. The majority of MLF1 was located in the cytoplasm, but the treatment of cells with leptomycin B rapidly induced a nuclear accumulation of MLF1. A mutation of the nuclear export signal (NES) motif identified in the MLF1 sequence enhanced the antiproliferative activity of MLF1. The fusion of MLF1 with NPM translocated MLF1 to the nucleolus and abolished the growth-suppressing activity. The introduction of NPM-MLF1 into early-passage murine embryonic fibroblasts allowed the cells to escape from cellular senescence at a markedly earlier stage and induced neoplastic transformation in collaboration with the oncogenic form of Ras. Interestingly, disruption of the MLF1-derived NES sequence completely abolished the growth-promoting activity of NPM-MLF1 in murine fibroblasts and hematopoietic cells. Thus, our results provide important evidence that the shuttling of MLF1 is critical for the regulation of cell proliferation and a disturbance in the shuttling balance increases the cell's susceptibility to oncogenic transformation.","['Yoneda-Kato, Noriko', 'Kato, Jun-Ya']","['Yoneda-Kato N', 'Kato JY']","['Graduate School of Biological Sciences, Nara Institute of Science and Technology, 8916-5 Takayama, Ikoma, Nara 630-0101, Japan. noriko-k@bs.naist.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20071029,United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Karyopherins)', '0 (MLF1 protein, human)', '0 (Mlf1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (exportin 1 protein)']",IM,"['Active Transport, Cell Nucleus', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Conserved Sequence', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Karyopherins/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasms/genetics/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear/metabolism', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/*metabolism']",2007/10/31 09:00,2008/01/12 09:00,['2007/10/31 09:00'],"['2007/10/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/12 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/31 09:00 [entrez]']","['MCB.02335-06 [pii]', '10.1128/MCB.02335-06 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2008 Jan;28(1):422-34. doi: 10.1128/MCB.02335-06.

Here we report on the synthesis and biological activity of a series of quinazolines that were prepared by a one-pot synthesis of substituted cyclohexadiene enaminonitriles from methyl-ketones. The approach, which employs NaH, complements published procedures where LDA is utilized. While the NaH catalyzed reaction generates the cyclohexadiene enaminonitriles in high yields with heterocyclic substrates, the reaction fails to promote product formation of aliphatic alkyl substrates. On the contrary, the LDA mediated synthesis favors the long chain alkyl substituents while reactions involving the aromatic substrates result in low yields. The final conversion to the quinazolines is also a modification on literature protocols. In cellular assays, the quinazolines showed the most promising activity against Jurkat with CC(50) values in the low micromolar range. Weak activity was observed against microbial strains (Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae). The substituted enaminonitrile intermediates also exhibited weak anti-microbial activity and cytotoxicity against human T-cell leukemia.","['Bench, Bennie J', 'Suarez, Victor H', 'Watanabe, Coran M H']","['Bench BJ', 'Suarez VH', 'Watanabe CM']","['Department of Chemistry, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX 77843, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071018,England,Bioorg Med Chem Lett,Bioorganic & medicinal chemistry letters,9107377,"['0 (Anti-Infective Agents)', '0 (Cyclohexenes)', '0 (Ketones)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Quinazolines)', '0F8Z5909QZ (1,4-cyclohexadiene)']",IM,"['Anti-Infective Agents/chemical synthesis/chemistry', 'Bacteria/drug effects', 'Biochemistry/methods', 'Cyclohexenes/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Ketones/*chemistry', 'Microbial Sensitivity Tests', 'Molecular Structure', 'Nitriles/*chemical synthesis/*chemistry/pharmacology', 'Quinazolines/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacology']",2007/10/31 09:00,2008/10/04 09:00,['2007/10/31 09:00'],"['2007/09/01 00:00 [received]', '2007/10/12 00:00 [revised]', '2007/10/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/10/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/04 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/31 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0960-894X(07)01217-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bmcl.2007.10.048 [doi]']",ppublish,Bioorg Med Chem Lett. 2008 May 15;18(10):3126-30. doi: 10.1016/j.bmcl.2007.10.048.

METHODS: 37 cases of CML in accelerated phase and blastic phase were collected and chromosome specimens of bone marrow cells were prepared by with 24-hour culture. G-banding technique was used for karyotyping. RESULTS: The major secondary chromosomal aberrations were double Ph, +8, and i (17q); the minor ones were -Y, chromosome 17 abnormalities other than i (17q) and inv (3q). The percentage of Philadelphia chromosome-positive clone with secondary chromosomal aberrations showed the following 4 types of change; amplification, no change, decrease and complete remission after treatment with IM. 2 of the 24 cases in CML in accelerated phase gained complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) and 2 of the 13 in blastic phase did so. The groups with amplification and no change showed significantly shorter overall survival and progression free survival than the groups with decrease and complete remission. CONCLUSION: The percentage of Philadelphia chromosome-positive clone with secondary chromosomal aberrations may drop in some CML patients after IM treatment and the patients may gain CCyR with accompanied prolonged survival.","['Zhang, Yan', 'Jiang, Qian', 'Qiu, Jing-ying', 'Chen, Shan-shan', 'Jiang, Bin', 'Huang, Xiao-jun']","['Zhang Y', 'Jiang Q', 'Qiu JY', 'Chen SS', 'Jiang B', 'Huang XJ']","[""Institute of Hematology, People's Hospital, Peking University, Beijing 100044, China.""]",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,China,Zhonghua Nei Ke Za Zhi,Zhonghua nei ke za zhi,16210490R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Blast Crisis', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism/pathology', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Banding', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/*drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Prognosis', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use']",2007/10/31 09:00,2008/07/12 09:00,['2007/10/31 09:00'],"['2007/10/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/12 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/31 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Nei Ke Za Zhi. 2007 Aug;46(8):648-50.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Less clear is the effect that they have had on the establishment of the endogenous proviruses resident in the human and mouse genomes. We used the mouse genome sequence to study diversity and genetic traits of nonecotropic murine leukemia viruses (polytropic [Pmv], modified polytropic [Mpmv], and xenotropic [Xmv] subgroups), the best-characterized large set of recently integrated proviruses. We identified 49 proviruses. In phylogenetic analyses, Pmvs and Mpmvs were monophyletic, whereas Xmvs were divided into several clades, implying a greater number of replication cycles between the integration events. Four distinct primer binding site types (Pro, Gln1, Gln2 and Thr) were dispersed within the phylogeny, indicating frequent mispriming. We analyzed the frequency and context of G-to-A mutations for the role of mA3 in formation of these proviruses. In the Pmv and Mpmv (but not Xmv) groups, mutations attributable to mA3 constituted a large fraction of the total. A significant number of nonsense mutations suggests the absence of purifying selection following mutation. A strong bias of G-to-A relative to C-to-T changes was seen, implying a strand specificity that can only have occurred prior to integration. The optimal sequence context of G-to-A mutations, TTC, was consistent with mA3. At least in the Pmv group, a significant 5' to 3' gradient of G-to-A mutations was consistent with mA3 editing. Altogether, our results for the first time suggest mA3 editing immediately preceding the integration event that led to retroviral endogenization, contributing to inactivation of infectivity.","['Jern, Patric', 'Stoye, Jonathan P', 'Coffin, John M']","['Jern P', 'Stoye JP', 'Coffin JM']","['Department of Molecular Biology and Microbiology, Tufts University School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20070910,United States,PLoS Genet,PLoS genetics,101239074,"['5Z93L87A1R (Guanine)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (Apobec3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (Cytidine Deaminase)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",IM,"['Adenine', 'Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Cytidine Deaminase/*metabolism', '*Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Guanine', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics/physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Phylogeny', 'Proviruses/genetics', 'Virus Replication']",2007/10/31 09:00,2007/11/14 09:00,['2007/10/31 09:00'],"['2007/06/20 00:00 [received]', '2007/09/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/10/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/11/14 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/31 09:00 [entrez]']","['07-PLGE-RA-0440 [pii]', '10.1371/journal.pgen.0030183 [doi]']",ppublish,PLoS Genet. 2007 Oct;3(10):2014-22. doi: 10.1371/journal.pgen.0030183.

We performed comprehensive DNA methylation profiling of promoter regions in normal peripheral blood by methylated CpG island amplification in combination with microarrays. This technique allowed us to simultaneously determine the methylation status of 6,177 genes, 92% of which include dense CpG islands. Among these 5,549 autosomal genes with dense CpG island promoters, we have identified 4.0% genes that are nearly completely methylated in normal blood, providing another exception to the general rule that CpG island methylation in normal tissue is limited to X inactivation and imprinted genes. We examined seven genes in detail, including ANKRD30A, FLJ40201, INSL6, SOHLH2, FTMT, C12orf12, and DPPA5. Dense promoter CpG island methylation and gene silencing were found in normal tissues studied except testis and sperm. In both tissues, bisulfite cloning and sequencing identified cells carrying unmethylated alleles. Interestingly, hypomethylation of several genes was associated with gene activation in cancer. Furthermore, reactivation of silenced genes could be induced after treatment with a DNA demethylating agent or in a cell line lacking DNMT1 and/or DNMT3b. Sequence analysis identified five motifs significantly enriched in this class of genes, suggesting that cis-regulatory elements may facilitate preferential methylation at these promoter CpG islands. We have identified a group of non-X-linked bona fide promoter CpG islands that are densely methylated in normal somatic tissues, escape methylation in germline cells, and for which DNA methylation is a primary mechanism of tissue-specific gene silencing.","['Shen, Lanlan', 'Kondo, Yutaka', 'Guo, Yi', 'Zhang, Jiexin', 'Zhang, Li', 'Ahmed, Saira', 'Shu, Jingmin', 'Chen, Xinli', 'Waterland, Robert A', 'Issa, Jean-Pierre J']","['Shen L', 'Kondo Y', 'Guo Y', 'Zhang J', 'Zhang L', 'Ahmed S', 'Shu J', 'Chen X', 'Waterland RA', 'Issa JP']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas at M.

However, the determinants for this phenotype have been controversial. Here, we show that HIV-1 capsid (CA) is involved in facilitating HIV infection of nondividing cells because amino acid changes on CA severely disrupt the cell-cycle independence of HIV. One mutant in the N-terminal domain of CA in particular has lost the cell-cycle independence in all cells tested, including primary macrophages. The defect in this mutant appears to be at a stage past nuclear entry. We also find that the loss of cell-cycle independence can be cell-type specific, which suggests that a cellular factor affects the ability of HIV to infect nondividing cells.

We investigated the prevalence of the LIF gene mutations in the population of infertile women and their impact on infertility treatment. DESIGN: A cohort study. SETTING: Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Faculty of Medicine and University Hospital of Charles University, Pilsen. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The population to screen consisted of 399 infertile women. The control population was comprised of 202 healthy fertile subjects. For the mutational analysis, the temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TGGE) followed by subsequent sequencing of the positive samples, had been used. The groups of fertile controls and infertile patients were compared for statistically significant difference using the Fisher's 2 by 2 Exact test. RESULTS: Twelve potentially functional LIF gene mutations, the G to A transversion at the position 3400 leading to the valin to methionin exchange at codon 64 (V64M) were detected in the group of infertile women. No mutations were identified in the control group, which means that the frequency of functionally relevant mutations of the LIF gene in infertile women is significantly enhanced in comparison with controls (P = 0.01, Fisher's 2 by 2 Exact test ). Seven of these patients were successfully treated by in vitro fertilization (IVF). CONCLUSION: The results suggest that the LIF gene mutation, the heterozygote G to A transition on the position 3400, affects fertility but the infertility treatment can succeed. Even though LIF gene mutations occur infrequently and can be overcome by infertility treatment, their impact on molecular events during early phases of pregnancy should be further elucidated.","['Kralickova, M', 'Sima, R', 'Martinek, P', 'Vanecek, T', 'Ulcova-Gallova, Z', 'Sima, P', 'Krizan, J', 'Kalis, V', 'Stepan Jr', 'Stepan, J', 'Rokyta, Z', 'Uher, P', 'Hes, O']","['Kralickova M', 'Sima R', 'Martinek P', 'Vanecek T', 'Ulcova-Gallova Z', 'Sima P', 'Krizan J', 'Kalis V', 'Stepan Jr', 'Stepan J', 'Rokyta Z', 'Uher P', 'Hes O']","['Gynekologicko-porodnicka klinika LF UK a FN, Plzen.']",['cze'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,Czech Republic,Ceska Gynekol,Ceska gynekologie,9423768,"['0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)']",IM,"['Female', '*Fertilization in Vitro', '*Heterozygote', 'Humans', 'Infertility, Female/*genetics/therapy', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*genetics', '*Point Mutation', 'Pregnancy']",2007/10/31 09:00,2008/01/09 09:00,['2007/10/31 09:00'],"['2007/10/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/09 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/31 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Ceska Gynekol. 2007 Aug;72(4):293-8.,Mutace v genu pro leukemicky inhibicni faktor v populaci neplodnych zen: heterozygotni bodova zamena G za A na pozici 3400 neovlivnuje uspesnost lecby.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They are usually associated with both acute and chronic myelogenous leukemia and myeloproliferative disorders. Leukemia involvement of the central nervous system most commonly presents as meningeal leukemia; intracerebral granulocytic sarcoma (IGS) is rare. Signs and symptoms depend on the brain structures involved. Magnetic resonance imaging with and without gadolinium is the imaging of choice to evaluate the tumor; however, tissue biopsy is essential for definitive diagnosis. Treatment usually involves radiation followed by chemotherapy, depending on the previous systemic treatment. Because medical literature about IGS is scarce, optimal treatment is unclear. With the number of leukemia patients in remission, the incidence of IGS is expected to rise. This is because most chemotherapeutic agents do not cross the blood-brain barrier, making the brain a target for leukemia recurrence.

METHODS: The methylation of LRP15 promoter and first exon of bone marrow mononuclear cells in 73 patients with AL, 10 with chronic leukemia (CL), 9 with hematological benign diseases, and 20 healthy transplantation donors was analyzed by using methylation specific polymerase chain reaction. The methylation of LRP15 gene promoter and first exon in COS7, K562, and HL60 cell lines was also assayed. RESULTS: No LRP15 gene promoter methylation was detected in COS7 cell line. LRP15 gene promoter was methylated in K562 and HL60 cell lines. No deletion of LRP15 gene was detected in all samples. In nearly all French-American-British leukemia subtypes, we found that frequency of LRP15 methylation in adult patients with AL was 71.23% (52/73). There was no detectable methylation in any of the 20 healthy donors and 8 chronic myeloid leukemia patients. The difference in frequency of LRP15 methylation between AL patients and healthy donors or CL patients (10.00%, 1/10) was significant (P < 0.01). Hypermethylation of LRP15 gene was found in 57.14% (16/28) of newly diagnosed AL patients, 83.33% of relapsed AL patients respectively, which was significantly different (P < 0.05). We also demonstrated LRP15 methylation in 55.56% (5/9) adults with benign hematological diseases. CONCLUSIONS: LRP15 methylation changes are common abnormalities in leukemia.

We used human eosinophylic leukemia EoL-1 cells, a common in vitro cellular model of human eosinophils. Here, we demonstrate that TBT causes a dose-dependent decrease in the viability of EoL-1 cells. When administered at sub-lethal concentrations, TBT significantly decreases the adhesion of EoL-1 cells to human fibroblasts (HSFs) and inhibits their migration on fibroblast surfaces. Since the basic function of eosinophils is to invade inflamed tissues, our results indicate that TBT, and possibly other organotin compounds, may affect major cellular properties involved in the determination of in vivo eosinophil function.","['Sroka, Jolanta', 'Wlosiak, Przemyslaw', 'Wilk, Anna', 'Antonik, Justyna', 'Czyz, Jaroslaw', 'Madeja, Zbigniew']","['Sroka J', 'Wlosiak P', 'Wilk A', 'Antonik J', 'Czyz J', 'Madeja Z']","['Department of Cell Biology, Faculty of Biochemistry, Biophysics and Biotechnology, Jagiellonian University, ul.

Previous studies with leukemia stem cells have shown that NF-kappaB pathway is important for leukemia stem cell survival. In this study, by using MCF7 sphere cells as model of breast cancer stem-like cells, we evaluated the effect of NF-kappaB pathway specific inhibitors on human breast cancer MCF7 sphere cells. Three inhibitors including parthenolide (PTL), pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate (PDTC) and its analog diethyldithiocarbamate (DETC) were found to preferentially inhibit MCF7 sphere cell proliferation. These compounds also showed preferential inhibition in term of proliferation and colony formation on MCF7 side population (SP) cells, a small fraction of MCF7 cells known to enrich in breast cancer stem-like cells. The preferential inhibition effect of these compounds was due to inhibition of the NF-kappaB activity in both MCF7 sphere and MCF7 cells, with higher inhibition effect on MCF7 sphere cells than on MCF7 cells. PDTC was further evaluated in vivo and showed significant tumor growth inhibition alone but had better tumor growth inhibition in combination with paclitaxel in the mouse xenograft model than either PDTC or paclitaxel alone. This study suggests that breast cancer stem-like cells could be selectively inhibited by targeting signaling pathways important for breast cancer stem-like cells.","['Zhou, Jiangbing', 'Zhang, Hao', 'Gu, Peihua', 'Bai, Jining', 'Margolick, Joseph B', 'Zhang, Ying']","['Zhou J', 'Zhang H', 'Gu P', 'Bai J', 'Margolick JB', 'Zhang Y']","['Department of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology, Bloomberg School of Public Health, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD 21205, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20071027,Netherlands,Breast Cancer Res Treat,Breast cancer research and treatment,8111104,"['0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Pyrrolidines)', '0 (Sesquiterpenes)', '0 (Thiocarbamates)', '25769-03-3 (pyrrolidine dithiocarbamic acid)', '2RDB26I5ZB (parthenolide)', '99Z2744345 (Ditiocarb)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Ditiocarb/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'NF-kappa B/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Paclitaxel/administration & dosage', 'Pyrrolidines/administration & dosage', 'Sesquiterpenes/administration & dosage', 'Spheroids, Cellular', 'Thiocarbamates/administration & dosage', 'Time Factors', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2007/10/30 09:00,2008/11/14 09:00,['2007/10/30 09:00'],"['2007/02/19 00:00 [received]', '2007/10/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/10/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/11/14 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/30 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s10549-007-9798-y [doi]'],ppublish,Breast Cancer Res Treat. 2008 Oct;111(3):419-27. doi: 10.1007/s10549-007-9798-y.

METHODS AND RESULTS: Cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes were stimulated by daunorubicin 1 mumol/L either with or without edaravone or superoxide dismutase mimetic Mn (III) tetrakis (1-methyl-4-pyridyl) porphyrin pentachloride (MnTMPyP). Cell viability was estimated by measuring the amount of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) released into the culture medium. Apoptosis was determined by a caspase-3 activity assay and a histone - DNA complex fragment assay. To investigate whether edaravone interfered with daunorubicin's anti-tumor effect, daunorubicin and edaravone were added to human leukemia K562 cells, and the surviving cells were counted. In addition, edaravone's in vivo effect was evaluated using Sprague - Dawley rats. A total of 15 mg/kg doxorubicin was injected intraperitoneally either with or without simultaneous edaravone injection. Two and 6 weeks after the final injection, left ventricular diastolic diameter and left ventricular fraction shortening were assessed echocardiographically. The LDH assay showed that edaravone significantly inhibited LDH release from cardiac myocytes (p=0.0428). The caspase-3 activity and histone - DNA complex fragment assays demonstrated that edaravone's apoptosis suppression effect was much weaker than that of MnTMPyP. The in vivo study showed that edaravone prevented doxorubicin-induced cardiac deterioration. Finally, edaravone was found to not affect daunorubicin's anticancer effect on K562 cells. CONCLUSIONS: Edaravone protects cardiomyocytes from anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity via an anti-necrotic rather than an anti-apoptotic effect.","['Ikegami, Ei', 'Fukazawa, Ryuji', 'Kanbe, Masaru', 'Watanabe, Miki', 'Abe, Masanori', 'Watanabe, Makoto', 'Kamisago, Mitsuhiro', 'Hajikano, Miharu', 'Katsube, Yasuhiro', 'Ogawa, Shunichi']","['Ikegami E', 'Fukazawa R', 'Kanbe M', 'Watanabe M', 'Abe M', 'Watanabe M', 'Kamisago M', 'Hajikano M', 'Katsube Y', 'Ogawa S']","['Department of Pediatrics, Nippon Medical School, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Japan,Circ J,Circulation journal : official journal of the Japanese Circulation Society,101137683,"['0 (Anthracyclines)', '0 (Free Radical Scavengers)', 'EC 1.1.1.27 (L-Lactate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'S798V6YJRP (Edaravone)', 'T3CHA1B51H (Antipyrine)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anthracyclines/*pharmacology', 'Antipyrine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Daunorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Edaravone', 'Free Radical Scavengers/*pharmacology', 'L-Lactate Dehydrogenase/metabolism', 'Myocytes, Cardiac/*cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Necrosis', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley']",2007/10/30 09:00,2008/02/13 09:00,['2007/10/30 09:00'],"['2007/10/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/13 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['JST.JSTAGE/circj/71.1815 [pii]', '10.1253/circj.71.1815 [doi]']",ppublish,Circ J. 2007 Nov;71(11):1815-20. doi: 10.1253/circj.71.1815.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although a host of signaling pathways participate in implantation, decidualization, and placentation, whether there is a common molecular link that coordinates these processes remains unknown. By exploiting genetic, molecular, pharmacological, and physiological approaches, we show here that the nuclear transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) delta plays a central role at various stages of pregnancy, whereas maternal PPARdelta is critical to implantation and decidualization, and embryonic PPARdelta is vital for placentation. Using trophoblast stem cells, we further elucidate that a reciprocal relationship between PPARdelta-AKT and leukemia inhibitory factor-STAT3 signaling pathways serves as a cell lineage sensor to direct trophoblast cell fates during placentation. This novel finding of stage-specific integration of maternal and embryonic PPARdelta signaling provides evidence that PPARdelta is a molecular link that coordinates implantation, decidualization, and placentation crucial to pregnancy success. This study is clinically relevant because deferral of on time implantation leads to spontaneous pregnancy loss, and defective trophoblast invasion is one cause of preeclampsia in humans.","['Wang, Haibin', 'Xie, Huirong', 'Sun, Xiaofei', 'Tranguch, Susanne', 'Zhang, Hao', 'Jia, Xiangxu', 'Wang, Dingzhi', 'Das, Sanjoy K', 'Desvergne, Beatrice', 'Wahli, Walter', 'DuBois, Raymond N', 'Dey, Sudhansu K']","['Wang H', 'Xie H', 'Sun X', 'Tranguch S', 'Zhang H', 'Jia X', 'Wang D', 'Das SK', 'Desvergne B', 'Wahli W', 'DuBois RN', 'Dey SK']","['Department of Pediatrics, Division of Reproductive and Developmental Biology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN 37232, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071026,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (PPAR delta)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Decidua/metabolism', 'Embryo Implantation', 'Female', 'Fertilization', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Ovulation', 'PPAR delta/*metabolism', 'Placenta/metabolism', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy, Animal/*physiology', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/physiology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stem Cells/cytology', 'Time Factors', 'Trophoblasts/metabolism']",2007/10/30 09:00,2008/03/05 09:00,['2007/10/30 09:00'],"['2007/10/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/05 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(20)77732-X [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M706577200 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2007 Dec 28;282(52):37770-82. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M706577200.

The subsequent identification of four other alternative splice variants that possess distinct functions and localizations suggested the diverse roles of survivin isoforms. An unspecified isoform of survivin was found recently to be induced in terminally differentiated neutrophils by cytokines that prolong the neutrophil lifespan, such as GM-CSF and G-CSF, suggesting the importance of survivin in blocking apoptosis in neutrophils. To examine the mechanism by which survivin inhibits neutrophil apoptosis, we attempted to induce survivin by GM-CSF/G-CSF in an HL60 cell line that was differentiated into neutrophils by all-trans retinoic acid and DMSO and freshly isolated human neutrophils. The antiapoptotic isoform ""Survivin,"" which was decreased during differentiation, was re-induced by GM-CSF in neutrophil-like, differentiated HL60. In contrast, in normal neutrophils, survivin mRNA was observed to increase spontaneously after 24 h incubation, and no additional elevation was induced by GM-CSF/G-CSF, which exerted their antiapoptotic effects on the neutrophils in 6 h, despite the lack of survivin induction. PCR and Western blotting detected Survivin-2 alpha, a dominant-negative of antiapoptotic Survivin, with no other isoforms in the freshly isolated or incubated neutrophils. Our study revealed that the expressed isoforms and the response to GM-CSF were different between the HL60-derived and normal neutrophils, which predominantly expressed Survivin-2 alpha, not likely involved in apoptosis inhibition by GM-CSF/G-CSF.","['Hu, Huiyuan', 'Shikama, Yayoi', 'Matsuoka, Isao', 'Kimura, Junko']","['Hu H', 'Shikama Y', 'Matsuoka I', 'Kimura J']","['Department of Pharmacology, Fukushima Medical University School of Medicine, 1 Hikarigaoka, Fukushima, 960-1295, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071026,United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,"['0 (BIRC5 protein, human)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Survivin)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/physiology', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Exons/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Genes, Dominant', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/pathology', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/*biosynthesis/chemistry/genetics/physiology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/chemistry/genetics/physiology', 'Neutrophils/cytology/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Protein Isoforms/biosynthesis/chemistry/genetics/physiology', 'Survivin', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology']",2007/10/30 09:00,2008/04/10 09:00,['2007/10/30 09:00'],"['2007/10/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/10 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['jlb.0507282 [pii]', '10.1189/jlb.0507282 [doi]']",ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 2008 Feb;83(2):393-400. doi: 10.1189/jlb.0507282.

Recently, several studies have indicated the aberrant methylation of E-cadherin gene could be a potential marker for leukemic patients. METHOD: We used bisulfite-modified DNA as a template for PCR amplification, resulting in conversion of unmethylated, but not methylated, cytosine into thymine within CpG islands of interest. The amplified product containing a pool of DNA fragments with altered nucleotide sequences was then hybridized with an oligonucleotide-based microarray. Five sets of oligonucleotide probes were designed to detect the methylation patterns of E-cadherin gene CpG islands in leukemia samples. The results were further validated by methylation-specific PCR (MSP). RESULTS: We found that all leukemia samples were methylated at different levels within the target sequences. The specific regions (the CpG sites #16-19 and #20-22) were revealed as hotspots for methylation in leukemic patients. These results showed that the microarray assay could successfully detect methylation changes of E-cadherin gene in leukemia quantitatively.

HLA matching was performed at the allelic level (i.e. high-resolution) using reference strand mediated conformation analysis (RSCA) at HLA-A, -B, -C, -DRB1, -DQB1 and -DPB1. The three-year probability of overall survival (OS) was 45% (median survival of 593 days; six-year overall survival probability was 40%). The mean follow-up was 1013 days (range 89-2697). Those matched for their HLA loci had a significantly better overall survival than the mismatched pairs (47% versus 40%, p=0.040). This result could be refined based on the number of alleles that were mismatched. In patients with a single HLA mismatch, the overall survival was 43%, compared to 30% in those with multiple mismatches; however, there was no statistically significant difference between matched pairs or those with one mismatch. Although there was no significant difference in the overall survival dependent on DPB1 matching in the group overall, in acute lymphocytic leukemia, DPB1-matched pairs had a significantly worse overall survival (log rank; p=0.025). Thus, a match for DPB1 is associated with a significantly increased risk of disease relapse, irrespective of the matching status for the other HLA molecules. In a multivariate analysis, a high pre-transplant levels of Tregs resulted in worse overall survival (relative risk (RR), 2.74; p=0.01), a trend to reduce disease-free survival (RR, 2.05; p=0.060) and to increase disease relapse (RR, 3.36; p=0.006). Residual patient CD4(+)CD25(hi) regulatory T cells may suppress graft-versus-tumour responses, decreasing the overall survival by increasing the rates of relapse. In acute leukemia, the presence of NOD2/CARD15 SNPs in the genotype of unrelated donor hematopoietic stem cell transplant pairs results in significant increases in disease relapse and consequently in death. These data show an important role for NOD2/CARD15 genotyping in transplantation and suggest a possible effect of the NOD2 protein in alloreactivity and tumour surveillance. Genotyping recipients and donors prior to transplant may present valuable information for planning and management of pre-transplant conditioning regimens, and for prognosis of the outcome.","['Madrigal, Alejandro', 'Shaw, Bronwen E']","['Madrigal A', 'Shaw BE']","['The Anthony Nolan Research Institute, Royal Free Hospital London, UK. a.madrigal@medsch.ucl.ac.uk']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20071025,United States,Blood Cells Mol Dis,"Blood cells, molecules & diseases",9509932,"['0 (HLA-DP Antigens)', '0 (HLA-DP beta-Chains)', '0 (HLA-DPB1 antigen)', '0 (NOD2 protein, human)', '0 (Nod2 Signaling Adaptor Protein)']",IM,"['Genotype', 'HLA-DP Antigens/*genetics/immunology', 'HLA-DP beta-Chains', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/*mortality', '*Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Immunogenetics/*methods', 'Immunologic Surveillance', 'Nod2 Signaling Adaptor Protein/*genetics/immunology', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Retrospective Studies', '*Survival Analysis', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory', 'Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation Immunology/*genetics', 'Treatment Outcome']",2007/10/30 09:00,2008/02/27 09:00,['2007/10/30 09:00'],"['2007/06/22 00:00 [received]', '2007/08/05 00:00 [revised]', '2007/08/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/10/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/27 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1079-9796(07)00176-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bcmd.2007.08.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Cells Mol Dis. 2008 Jan-Feb;40(1):40-3. doi: 10.1016/j.bcmd.2007.08.004.

Imatinib mesylate (Gleevec) was added with improvement, and subsequent CSF study showed normalization of CSF cytology analysis. However, re-collection of subdural fluid developed later and resulted in consciousness disturbance, and the patient died thereafter. CONCLUSION: Idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome remains a serious condition with a poor prognosis for most patients. Cerebrospinal fluid infiltration by immature eosinophils is a rare condition in IHS and may lead to poor prognosis, as observed in this patient, despite improved medical management (steroid and imatinib mesylate) and adequate surgical shunting for the subdural effusion.","['Chou, Chiang-Wei', 'Hsu, Sanford P C', 'Chen, Ming-Teh', 'Chen, Min-Hsiung', 'Shih, Yang-Hsin', 'Lee, Liang-Shong', 'Lin, Chun-Fu']","['Chou CW', 'Hsu SP', 'Chen MT', 'Chen MH', 'Shih YH', 'Lee LS', 'Lin CF']","['Department of Neurosurgery, Neurological Institute, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taiwan School of Medicine, National Yang Ming University, Taipei 112, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Surg Neurol,Surgical neurology,0367070,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid Shunts', 'Eosinophils/*pathology', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Humans', 'Hypereosinophilic Syndrome/*cerebrospinal fluid/*physiopathology', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Intracranial Hypertension/etiology/*physiopathology', 'Male', 'Piperazines/therapeutic use', 'Prognosis', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use', 'Subdural Effusion/diagnostic imaging/pathology/*physiopathology', 'Subdural Space/diagnostic imaging/pathology/*physiopathology', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed', 'Treatment Failure']",2007/12/06 09:00,2008/01/10 09:00,['2007/12/06 09:00'],"['2006/12/13 00:00 [received]', '2007/01/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/12/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/10 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0090-3019(07)00233-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.surneu.2007.01.077 [doi]']",ppublish,Surg Neurol. 2007;68 Suppl 1:S52-5; discussion S55. doi: 10.1016/j.surneu.2007.01.077.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In precursor T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (pre-T ALL), myeloid markers CD13 and CD33 are frequent while CD117 is rare. In the present investigation, 71 cases of confirmed pre-B ALL were evaluated for the presence of CD13 and CD33. Of the 19 (27%) cases that positively expressed myeloid markers, 10 (53%) expressed CD13, 17 (89%) expressed CD33, and 1 (5%) expressed CD117. Eight (42%) expressed both CD13 and CD33, and 1 (5%) expressed CD13, CD33, and CD117. Twenty-one cases of confirmed pre-T ALL were analyzed for myeloid markers CD13, CD33, CD117, and MPO. Of the 6 (29%) expressing myeloid markers, 4 (67%) were positive for CD13, 4 (67%) for CD33, 3 50(%) for CD117, and 1 (17%) for MPO. One (17%) was positive for both CD13 and CD117; one (17%) for CD13 and CD33; one (17%) for CD13, CD33 and CD117; and one (17%) for CD13, CD33 and MPO. These markers portend a poor prognosis compared to ALL cases without myeloid antigens, and a poor response to drug therapies targeting conventional ALL. Future studies will be directed to correlation of these markers with prognosis and therapeutic response, as well as whether drug therapies targeting myeloid antigens could be of use in treatment.","['Suggs, Jeanann L', 'Cruse, Julius M', 'Lewis, Robert E']","['Suggs JL', 'Cruse JM', 'Lewis RE']","['Department of Pathology, University of Mississippi Medical Center, 2500 North State Street, Jackson, MS 39216, USA. mlovell@som.umsmed.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20070907,Netherlands,Exp Mol Pathol,Experimental and molecular pathology,0370711,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Biomarkers)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Biomarkers/*metabolism', 'Child', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*metabolism', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Precursor Cells, B-Lymphoid/*metabolism', 'World Health Organization']",2007/10/30 09:00,2008/02/05 09:00,['2007/10/30 09:00'],"['2007/08/20 00:00 [received]', '2007/08/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/10/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/05 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0014-4800(07)00109-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.yexmp.2007.08.012 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Mol Pathol. 2007 Dec;83(3):471-3. doi: 10.1016/j.yexmp.2007.08.012.

There are no data available on what level of MRD might be 'safe' without an overt risk of relapse, or whether any such level exists at all. To address this issue in prospective studies, we have developed a quantitative molecular approach to monitor MRD in CLL, which allows the malignant clone to be traced with far higher sensitivity than possible with the techniques available currently. METHOD: To quantify MRD in CLL patients, a novel locked nucleic acid (LNA)-RNA-based quantitative real-time PCR technique was developed. Clone-specific assays were prepared for 62 CLL patients. Thirty patients were followed up molecularly for a median of 250 days (range 69-570 days). All patients were administered chemo/immunotherapy. RESULTS: In three patients, molecular negativity was achieved, as estimated by LNA-based assays. In one patient, a sustained molecular negativity was established by chemo/immunotherapy and the patient remains molecularly negative (322 days). The LNA-based assay enabled us to evaluate MRD in a reproducible manner with the sensitivity of 10(-7). CONCLUSION: LNA-RNA-based quantitative real-time PCR is an effective approach for MRD monitoring with the potential for increased sensitivity compared with standard DNA-based assays used for molecular follow-up.","['Pekova, Sona', 'Bezdickova, Ludmila', 'Smolej, Lukas', 'Kozak, Tomas', 'Hochova, Ivana', 'Zak, Pavel', 'Tomsikova, Lucie', 'Prucha, Miroslav']","['Pekova S', 'Bezdickova L', 'Smolej L', 'Kozak T', 'Hochova I', 'Zak P', 'Tomsikova L', 'Prucha M']","['Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Hematology and Immunology, Na Homolce Hospital, Prague, Czech Republic. sona.pekova@homolka.cz']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,New Zealand,Mol Diagn Ther,Molecular diagnosis & therapy,101264260,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/genetics/metabolism', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Diagnostic Techniques/methods', 'Neoplasm, Residual/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization/*methods', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Prospective Studies', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/metabolism', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase/genetics/metabolism']",2007/10/30 09:00,2008/02/27 09:00,['2007/10/30 09:00'],"['2007/10/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/27 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['1155 [pii]', '10.1007/BF03256253 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Diagn Ther. 2007;11(5):325-35. doi: 10.1007/BF03256253.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, 1-D gel electrophoresis coupled with LC/MS/MS (1-D geLC/MS/MS) was carried out with bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) to identify proteins associated with ufCB-induced lung injury. If required, Western blot was conducted additionally to validate proteins. Thirty-three proteins were identified, including leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Western blot analysis showed that ufCB exposure caused the increases of LIFR and EGFR in BALF and decreases of both receptors in lung tissues, suggesting the acceleration of epithelial shedding from the lung and increase of cell debris with membrane proteins EGFR and LIFR in BALF. There were strong correlations between vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and albumin (p<0.01) or alpha2-macroglobulin (alpha2M) in BALF (p<0.05). Importantly, antioxidant ceruloplasmin (Cp) was shown to be produced from lung epithelial cells in response to ufCB exposure. This is the first study to apply 1-D ge LC/MS/MS and experimental studies to reveal the mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of ufCB-induced lung injury.","['Chang, Chih-Ching', 'Chen, Shu-Hui', 'Ho, Shih-Hsin', 'Yang, Chun-Yuh', 'Wang, Hong-Da', 'Tsai, Mei-Ling']","['Chang CC', 'Chen SH', 'Ho SH', 'Yang CY', 'Wang HD', 'Tsai ML']","['Department of Environmental and Occupational Health, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Germany,Proteomics,Proteomics,101092707,"['0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lifr protein, mouse)', '0 (Proteome)', '0 (Serum Albumin)', '0 (Soot)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '0 (vascular endothelial growth factor A, mouse)', 'EC 1.16.3.1 (Ceruloplasmin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid/*chemistry/cytology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Ceruloplasmin/analysis/metabolism', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Epithelial Cells/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'ErbB Receptors/analysis/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit/analysis/metabolism', 'Leukocytes/pathology', 'Lung/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Lung Diseases/chemically induced/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred ICR', 'Particle Size', 'Proteome/*analysis/metabolism', 'Proteomics/*methods', 'Serum Albumin/analysis/metabolism', 'Soot/administration & dosage/chemistry/toxicity', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/analysis/metabolism']",2007/10/30 09:00,2008/03/28 09:00,['2007/10/30 09:00'],"['2007/10/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/28 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/30 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pmic.200700164 [doi]'],ppublish,Proteomics. 2007 Dec;7(23):4388-97. doi: 10.1002/pmic.200700164.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although treatment intensity and outcome were not comparable, with improvements in survival it is important to evaluate the rate and the type of second neoplasms in adults with ALL. METHODS: The data from the GET-LALA group were analyzed. A cohort of 1494 patients, aged 15 to 60 years and enrolled in 2 successive multicenter protocols between 1987 and 2002, was observed to determine the incidence of second neoplasms and associated risk factors. The median follow-up from diagnosis was 6 years. RESULTS: By February 2005 secondary or concomitant neoplasms were documented in 23 patients, including 9 acute myeloid leukemias (AML) or myelodysplasias (MDS), 4 non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL), 5 skin tumors, and 5 other solid tumors (1 lung cancer, 1 tongue carcinoma, 1 thymoma, 1 condrosarcoma, 1 histiocytosis). Neoplasms developed 0.5 to 13.8 years (median, 4.5 years) after the diagnosis of ALL. There were 22 patients in first remission and 1 was in second remission. The overall cumulative risk of secondary neoplasms was 2.1% at 5 years, 4.9% at 10 years, and 9.4% at 15 years. The cumulative risk of developing a second hematologic malignancy was 1.8% at 5 years, 2.2% at 10 years, 3.3% at 18 years; that of developing a solid tumor was 0.2% at 5 years, 2.8% at 10 years, 6.2% at 15 years. The development of secondary neoplasm was not associated with the use of any specific cytotoxic agent. However, the risk of skin tumor increased with radiation dose and transplantation (P = .01). Overall survival (OS) after the diagnosis of a second malignant neoplasm was 55% at 10 years. However, the median OS in patients developing AML/MDS was 5.7 months. CONCLUSIONS: The data document that adult ALL survivors are at an increased risk of later malignancy. The risk of secondary or concomitant neoplasm appeared higher than that of childhood ALL previously reported in the literature. Considering the low survival rate of this large unselected adult ALL cohort (32% at 10 years) as compared with that observed in childhood ALL, the risk of second malignancy remains underestimated. Larger series with long-term follow-up are necessary, as well as methods of screening and identification of patients at increased risk.","['Tavernier, Emmanuelle', 'Le, Quoc-Hung', 'de Botton, Stephane', 'Dhedin, Nathalie', 'Bulabois, Claude-Eric', 'Reman, Oumedaly', 'Vey, Norbert', 'Lheritier, Veronique', 'Dombret, Herve', 'Thomas, Xavier']","['Tavernier E', 'Le QH', 'de Botton S', 'Dhedin N', 'Bulabois CE', 'Reman O', 'Vey N', 'Lheritier V', 'Dombret H', 'Thomas X']","['Hopital Nord, Saint-Etienne, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/epidemiology/*etiology/mortality', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*pathology/radiotherapy', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Analysis']",2007/10/30 09:00,2008/01/30 09:00,['2007/10/30 09:00'],"['2007/10/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/30 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/30 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.23097 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2007 Dec 15;110(12):2747-55. doi: 10.1002/cncr.23097.,,,,,,,,,,['2007 American Cancer Society'],,,,,,,,,,,,

We reviewed the literature on the predictive factors for mortality related to nosocomial infection in pediatric medicine. Electronic searches in English, Spanish and Portuguese of the PubMed/MEDLINE, LILACS and Cochrane Collaboration Databases was performed, focusing on studies that had been published from 1996 to 2006. The key words were: nosocomial infection and mortality and pediatrics/neonate/ newborn/child/infant/adolescent. The risk factors found to be associated with mortality were: nosocomial infection itself, leukemia, lymphopenia, neutropenia, corticosteroid therapy, multiple organ failure, previous antimicrobial therapy, catheter use duration, candidemia, cancer, bacteremia, age over 60, invasive procedures, mechanical ventilation, transport out of the pediatric intensive care unit, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Burkholderia cepacia infections, acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE) II scores over 15. Among these factors, the only one that can be minimized is inadequate antimicrobial treatment, which has proven to be an important contributor to hospital mortality in critically-ill patients. There is room for further prognosis research on this matter to determine local differences.

The most studied mechanism for ATRA resistance is the autoinduced metabolism regulated by the retinoic acid receptor-CYP26 pathway. However, treatment of cancer is usually not done with a single antineoplastic agent, but with a variety of combined chemotherapy regimens, including several anticancer drugs, and other concomitantly administered supportive drugs. Pregnane X receptor (PXR), an orphan nuclear receptor that functions as a ligand-activated transcription factor, serves as an important xenobiotic sensor regulating metabolism and elimination. Many prescription drugs are PXR ligands, which can activate PXR target genes, including phase I enzyme, phase II enzyme, and transporter genes. The present study was designed to examine the role of PXR in ATRA metabolism. Due to the marked species differences in response to PXR ligands, Pxr-null, wild-type, and PXR-humanized transgenic mouse models were used. In addition to pregnenolone 16alpha-carbonitrile, several clinically relevant PXR ligands (rifampicin and dexamethasone) all increased ATRA metabolism both in vitro and in vivo, which was PXR-dependent, and up-regulation of Cyp3a was the major contributor. Furthermore, induction of the Mdr1a, Mrp3, and Oatp2 genes was also observed. This study suggested that coadministration of PXR ligands can increase ATRA metabolism through activation of the PXR-CYP3A pathway, which might be a mechanism for some form of ATRA resistance. Other PXR target transporters might also be involved.","['Wang, Ting', 'Ma, Xiaochao', 'Krausz, Kristopher W', 'Idle, Jeffrey R', 'Gonzalez, Frank J']","['Wang T', 'Ma X', 'Krausz KW', 'Idle JR', 'Gonzalez FJ']","['Laboratory of Metabolism, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071025,United States,J Pharmacol Exp Ther,The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics,0376362,"['0 (Pregnane X Receptor)', '0 (Receptors, Steroid)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Drug Resistance/drug effects/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Microsomes, Liver/drug effects/metabolism', 'Pregnane X Receptor', 'Receptors, Steroid/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/physiology', 'Tretinoin/*metabolism/*pharmacology']",2007/10/27 09:00,2008/02/20 09:00,['2007/10/27 09:00'],"['2007/10/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/20 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['jpet.107.131045 [pii]', '10.1124/jpet.107.131045 [doi]']",ppublish,J Pharmacol Exp Ther. 2008 Feb;324(2):674-84. doi: 10.1124/jpet.107.131045.

Here we propose and test a new approach to crystallization, in which the crystallization target is fused to a polymerizing protein module, so that polymer formation drives crystallization of the target. We test the approach using a polymerization module called 2TEL, which consists of two tandem sterile alpha motif (SAM) domains from the protein translocation Ets leukemia (TEL). The 2TEL module is engineered to polymerize as the pH is lowered, which allows the subtle modulation of polymerization needed for crystal formation. We show that the 2TEL module can drive the crystallization of 11 soluble proteins, including three that resisted prior crystallization attempts. In addition, the 2TEL module crystallizes in the presence of various detergents, suggesting that it might facilitate membrane protein crystallization. The crystal structures of two fusion proteins show that the TELSAM polymer is responsible for the majority of contacts in the crystal lattice. The results suggest that biological polymers could be designed as crystallization modules.","['Nauli, Sehat', 'Farr, Saman', 'Lee, Yueh-Jung', 'Kim, Hye-Yeon', 'Faham, Salem', 'Bowie, James U']","['Nauli S', 'Farr S', 'Lee YJ', 'Kim HY', 'Faham S', 'Bowie JU']","['UCLA-DOE Institute of Genomics and Proteomics, University of California, Los Angeles 90095-1570, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Protein Sci,Protein science : a publication of the Protein Society,9211750,"['0 (Amino Acids)', '0 (Detergents)', '0 (ETS translocation variant 6 protein)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Polymers)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)']",IM,"['Amino Acids/chemistry', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Crystallization', 'Crystallography, X-Ray/*methods', 'Detergents/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Membrane Proteins/chemistry', 'Models, Molecular', 'Polymers/*chemistry', 'Protein Conformation', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Proteins/chemistry', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/chemistry', 'Repressor Proteins/*metabolism']",2007/10/27 09:00,2008/01/16 09:00,['2007/10/27 09:00'],"['2007/10/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/16 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['16/11/2542 [pii]', '10.1110/ps.073074207 [doi]']",ppublish,Protein Sci. 2007 Nov;16(11):2542-51. doi: 10.1110/ps.073074207.,,"['R01 GM063919-06/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM063919-05/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM063919-08/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA081000/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM063919-07/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM063919/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC2211692,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fas gene mutations, aberrant transcripts, and abundant expression of Fas have been reported in adult T cell leukemia (ATL). To further elucidate the role of Fas in ATL pathogenesis, we investigated whether the -670 FAS promoter A/G polymorphism (STAT1-binding site) might contribute to susceptibility and clinical outcome in ATL. Thirty-one patients with ATL, 33 healthy, human T lymphotropic virus type 1-infected individuals, and 70 healthy, uninfected controls were genotyped for the FAS -670 polymorphism by PCR-restriction fragment-length polymorphism. The AA genotype was significantly over-represented in ATL patients in comparison with healthy controls (P=0.006), as well as asymptomatics (P=0.037), corresponding to an odds ratio (OR) of 3.79 [95% confidence intervals (CI; 1.28-11.41)] and 4.58 [95% CI (1.13-20.03)], respectively. The AA group also comprised significantly more aggressive (acute and lymphoma) clinical subtypes [P=0.012; OR=8.40; 95% CI (1.60-44.12)]. In addition, we observed a statistically significant association between GG genotype and survival (log rank test, P=0.032). Finally, IFN-gamma-induced but not basal FAS mRNA levels were increased significantly (P=0.049) in PBMCs from AA versus GG individuals, demonstrating the IFN-dependent functionality of the -670 polymorphism.

Full IQ and educational outcomes were positively related to child's age and mother's age. Low depression scores were associated with high Verbal IQ one and 2 years post-HPCT, and with high visual motor scores 2 years post-HPCT. Poor educational outcomes were related to increased time since diagnosis. Two years post-HPCT, Performance IQ and Processing Speed were above the norm values whereas arithmetic and motor scores were below.

Ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis has previously been shown to be one such tool with which Notch regulates the turnover of the basic helix-loophelix transcription factor, E47. Here, we show that Notch signaling also accelerated the degradation of Tal1/SCL (T cell acute leukemia 1/stem cell leukemia) protein, a basic helix-loop-helix protein involved in the development of hematopoietic, vascular, and neuronal tissues. Notch-induced Tal1/SCL degradation was mediated by ubiquitination and proteasomes. The sequence responsible for Tal1 degradation was localized to a region in the C terminus of Tal1, which is evolutionarily conserved, thus suggesting a functional significance. Analogous to the situation for E47, Notch-induced Tal1/SCL degradation not only required Skp2, a substrate-binding subunit of SCF ubiquitin ligase complexes, but also relied on CHIP, a chaperone-binding protein with a ubiquitin ligase activity. In contrast to the fact that the N-terminal tetratricopeptide region (TPR) domain of CHIP is necessary and sufficient for E47 ubiquitination and degradation, CHIP promoted Tal1 degradation with both chaperone binding and ubiquitin ligase activities, which are mediated by its TPR domain and U box, respectively. Although the TPR domain was not involved in Tal1/SCL binding, it was required for enhancing its degradation. Likewise, the ubiquitin ligase activity of CHIP was dispensable for Tal1/SCL binding but essential for degradation. These findings provide both novel mechanistic insights into the operation of cullin-based ubiquitin ligase complexes and potential means by which Notch and Tal1/SCL regulate eukaryotic development.","['Nie, Lei', 'Wu, Huaqing', 'Sun, Xiao-Hong']","['Nie L', 'Wu H', 'Sun XH']","['Immunobiology and Cancer Program, Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma 73104, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20071025,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (S-Phase Kinase-Associated Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '135471-20-4 (TAL1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (STUB1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Kidney/embryology', 'Mice', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics/*metabolism', 'S-Phase Kinase-Associated Proteins/*metabolism', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'Transfection', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/*metabolism', '*Ubiquitination']",2007/10/27 09:00,2008/03/21 09:00,['2007/10/27 09:00'],"['2007/10/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/21 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(20)68975-X [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M704981200 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2008 Jan 11;283(2):684-92. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M704981200.

RESULTS: Sixteen eligible patients were entered into the rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) group. Response (complete remission or partial remission) was seen in five children (31%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 14-56%). Ten eligible patients with other soft tissue sarcomas were recruited into the non-RMS group. Two responses (20%, 95% CI 6-51%) were seen. Toxicity in both groups was predictable nausea, vomiting and marrow suppression and there were no toxic deaths.

Comparison of their value with respect to relapse prevention, disease-free survival, and overall survival has been impossible until recently when the results of several randomized trials became available. Herein, we try to dissect data from these randomized trials to evaluate the role of autoSCT in patients with ALL in complete remission. Five prospectively randomized trials were found in which patients with a family donor were eligible for an alloSCT and the remaining patients were randomized between autoSCT and continuation chemotherapy. In addition, in two prospectively randomized trials all patients with a donor were eligible for an alloSCT and the remaining patients were eligible for autoSCT. Using intention to treat, in the majority of ALL studies alloSCT is superior to autoSCT or intensive continuation chemotherapy. It still has to be determined which subgroups of ALL benefit most of allogeneic transplantation, since in some trials the advantage of allogeneic transplantation was confined to the standard-risk ALL patients and in other trials to the high-risk patients. With respect to the role of autoSCT compared to continuation chemotherapy, both treatment modalities show equal, although for high-risk ALL inferior, overall survival chances. In one large trial the disease-free survival in the autoSCT arm was inferior to that in the chemotherapy arm. This finding may eventually have an impact on the overall survival rate. Currently, the main benefit of autoSCT may be its short duration compared with the continuation chemotherapy regimen.","['Willemze, Roel', 'Labar, Boris']","['Willemze R', 'Labar B']","['Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands, and University Hospital Center Rebro, Zagreb, Croatia.

Autologous stem cell transplantation (SCT) represents one of the options of postremission therapy in AML. Here we discuss the therapeutic impact of consolidation treatment with autologous SCT that has been studied extensively. Meta-analyses of published randomized trials using bone marrow as the source of stem cells show a modest improvement of disease-free survival as compared to nonmyeloablative chemotherapy. However, there is no apparent improvement of overall survival, probably due to the slightly increased mortality associated with autologous bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Subsequently, the value of autologous SCT in different prognostic subsets of AML is discussed. Autologous mobilized peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) transplantation offers a much faster hematopoietic recovery and is associated with reduced morbidity and treatment-related mortality. To fully appreciate the role of autologous PBSC transplantation, the results of a recently closed randomized trial must be awaited.","['Breems, Dimitri A', 'Lowenberg, Bob']","['Breems DA', 'Lowenberg B']","['Department of Hematology, Hospital Network Antwerp, General Hospital Stuivenberg, Antwerp, Belgium, and Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Semin Hematol,Seminars in hematology,0404514,,IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Evidence-Based Medicine', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/mortality/radiotherapy/*surgery', '*Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Risk Assessment/methods', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2007/10/27 09:00,2008/02/28 09:00,['2007/10/27 09:00'],"['2007/10/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/28 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0037-1963(07)00119-9 [pii]', '10.1053/j.seminhematol.2007.08.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Semin Hematol. 2007 Oct;44(4):259-66. doi: 10.1053/j.seminhematol.2007.08.002.,,,,,,,,29,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The principal rationale for autografting in CP resides on the reduction of the tumor burden and the number of leukemic cells at risk of developing blastic transformation, and the possibility of eradicating already mutated cells. In a European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) Registry survey, patients with CML in CP, undergoing autologous stem cell transplantation (auto-SCT) for the first time, had an overall survival of 65% at 5 years from transplant with more than 50% of all patients remaining in CP. The main point made by this retrospective study was that in patients refractory to interferon-alpha (IFN), 70% achieved a cytogenetic response post autografting, which was complete or major in 31%. Since the advent of imatinib, autografting in CML has experienced a substantial decline. Theoretically, there are several possible ways of using auto-SCT in combination with imatinib: (1) to reverse resistance to imatinib; (2) to eliminate a Ph-positive clone bearing a BCR-ABL kinase domain mutation; and (3) to reduce the level of residual disease after a cytogenetic response to imatinib in patients in whom Ph-negative cells had been harvested. The exact role of auto-SCT in the present management of CML remains unanswered.","['Olavarria, Eduardo']",['Olavarria E'],"['Haematology Department, Hammersmith Hospital, Imperial College London, London, UK. e.olavarria@imperial.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Semin Hematol,Seminars in hematology,0404514,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Purging', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Evidence-Based Medicine', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukapheresis/methods', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/mortality/radiotherapy/*surgery', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",2007/10/27 09:00,2008/02/28 09:00,['2007/10/27 09:00'],"['2007/10/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/28 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0037-1963(07)00120-5 [pii]', '10.1053/j.seminhematol.2007.08.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Semin Hematol. 2007 Oct;44(4):252-8. doi: 10.1053/j.seminhematol.2007.08.003.,,,,,,,,53,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

(2) What is the therapeutic potential of ASCT in terms of disease control in relation to toxicity? (3) What is the role of ASCT in the current arsenal of CLL treatment modalities? Evidence from clinical and minimal residual disease (MRD) studies suggests that ASCT has curative potential in only a few patients, if any. Nevertheless, ASCT might be capable of prolonged disease control even in CLL with poor-risk features. Uncontrolled prospective studies have indicated the superiority of ASCT over alkylator and fludarabine monotherapy but not necessarily over purine analogue cyclophosphamide or antibody combinations. A significant risk of secondary neoplasms, in particular myelodysplasias, has to be taken into account. Therefore, ASCT cannot be considered as standard treatment for CLL and should be performed only in the context of clinical trials.","['Dreger, Peter', 'Brand, Ronald', 'Michallet, Mauricette']","['Dreger P', 'Brand R', 'Michallet M']","['Department of Medicine V, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany, and Department of Hematology, Hopital Edouard Herriot, Lyon, France. peter.dreger@med.uni-heidelberg.de']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Semin Hematol,Seminars in hematology,0404514,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'Q41OR9510P (Melphalan)', 'U68WG3173Y (Carmustine)', 'Dexa-BEAM protocol']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Purging', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Carmustine/administration & dosage', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Dexamethasone/administration & dosage', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Evidence-Based Medicine', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/mortality/radiotherapy/*surgery', 'Melphalan/administration & dosage', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/mortality', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",2007/10/27 09:00,2008/02/28 09:00,['2007/10/27 09:00'],"['2007/10/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/28 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0037-1963(07)00118-7 [pii]', '10.1053/j.seminhematol.2007.08.008 [doi]']",ppublish,Semin Hematol. 2007 Oct;44(4):246-51. doi: 10.1053/j.seminhematol.2007.08.008.,,,,,,,,35,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Autologous HSCTs are the standard of care for defined patients with lymphoid malignancies and for certain solid tumors of childhood. They continue to be evaluated in acute myeloid leukemia and are being investigated in phase II and III studies for defined severe autoimmune disorders.

Here we report that Cu(2+) is critically needed for PDTC to inhibit histone acetylation in both human leukemia HL-60 cells and human hepatoma Hep3B cells. The inhibition of histone acetylation mainly resulted from the increase of intracellular Cu(2+), but was not due to the inhibition of NF-kappaB activity by PDTC-Cu(2+) since the combinations of Cu(2+) with SN50, MG132 (two known NF-kappaB inhibitors), or bathocuproine disulfonate (BCS, a specific Cu(2+) chelator that does not cross the plasma membrane), did not lead to obvious inhibition of histone acetylation. Histone acetyltransferase (HAT) and histone deacetylase (HDAC) are the enzymes controlling the state of histone acetylation in vivo. Cells exposed to PDTC-Cu(2+) showed a comparable decrease in histone acetylation levels in HL-60 cells in the absence or presence of the HDAC inhibitors, trichostatin A (TSA) or sodium butyrate (NaBu); the inhibition rates were about 45, 44 and 43%, respectively. PDTC-Cu(2+) had no effect on the activity of HDAC in vitro, but significantly inhibited the HAT activity both in HL-60 cells and in a cell-free in vitro system. PDTC-Cu(2+) also induced HL-60 cell apoptosis, and treating cells with TSA, NaBu or BCS significantly attenuated the apoptosis induced by PDTC-Cu(2+). Collectively, these results showed that inhibition of histone acetylation represents a distinct mechanism for the cytotoxicity of PDTC in the presence of Cu(2+), where HAT is its possible molecular target.","['Chen, Jie', 'Du, Changsheng', 'Kang, Jiuhong', 'Wang, Jianmin']","['Chen J', 'Du C', 'Kang J', 'Wang J']","['Department of Hematology, Changhai Hospital, The Second Military Medical University, Shanghai 200433, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20070915,Ireland,Chem Biol Interact,Chemico-biological interactions,0227276,"['0 (Butyrates)', '0 (Chelating Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (Phenanthrolines)', '0 (Pyrrolidines)', '0 (Thiocarbamates)', '25769-03-3 (pyrrolidine dithiocarbamic acid)', '3X2S926L3Z (trichostatin A)', '73348-75-1 (bathocuproine sulfonate)', '789U1901C5 (Copper)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (Histone Acetyltransferases)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)', 'LRX7AJ16DT (Copper Sulfate)', 'W4X6ZO7939 (1,10-phenanthroline)']",IM,"['Acetylation/drug effects', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Butyrates/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Chelating Agents/pharmacology', 'Copper/*pharmacology', 'Copper Sulfate/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Histone Acetyltransferases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Histone Deacetylases/metabolism', 'Histones/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/pharmacology', 'Leukemia/metabolism/pathology', 'Phenanthrolines/pharmacology', 'Pyrrolidines/*pharmacology', 'Thiocarbamates/*pharmacology']",2007/10/27 09:00,2008/04/04 09:00,['2007/10/27 09:00'],"['2007/07/24 00:00 [received]', '2007/09/11 00:00 [revised]', '2007/09/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/10/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/04 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0009-2797(07)00289-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.cbi.2007.09.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Chem Biol Interact. 2008 Jan 10;171(1):26-36. doi: 10.1016/j.cbi.2007.09.004.

However, the effects of fludarabine on solid tumors remain unclear. We reported previously that fludarabine inhibited expression of hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha (HIF-1alpha) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in human ovarian cancer cells. The present study aims to investigate, (1) the mechanisms that fludarabine inhibits expression of HIF-1alpha and (2) the effects of fludarabine on tumor cells survival under hypoxia. Human hepatoma HepG2 cells were tested. We found that fludarabine reduced HIF-1alpha stability through prolyl hydroxylation. Fludarabine suppressed hypoxia-induced expression of VEGF and its receptor KDR. It inhibited VEGF-induced activation of AKT and ERK signaling and reduced hypoxia-enhanced HepG2 cell survivability. HepG2 cells were much more sensitive to fludarabine treatment under hypoxia than under nomoxia. These results suggest that fludarabine reduces survivability of HepG2 cells via VEGF signaling under hypoxia.","['Xue, Jing', 'Bi, Xinsheng', 'Wu, Guohao', 'Meng, Dan', 'Fang, Jing']","['Xue J', 'Bi X', 'Wu G', 'Meng D', 'Fang J']","['The Institute for Nutritional Sciences, Shanghai Institute for Biological Sciences, Graduate School of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 200031, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20070925,United States,Arch Biochem Biophys,Archives of biochemistry and biophysics,0372430,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (HIF1A protein, human)', '0 (Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit)', '0 (VEGFA protein, human)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)', 'S88TT14065 (Oxygen)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/*metabolism', 'Cell Hypoxia', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/*drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit/*metabolism', 'Oxygen/*metabolism', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/*metabolism', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives']",2007/10/27 09:00,2007/12/19 09:00,['2007/10/27 09:00'],"['2007/05/18 00:00 [received]', '2007/08/24 00:00 [revised]', '2007/09/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/10/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/19 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0003-9861(07)00471-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.abb.2007.09.013 [doi]']",ppublish,Arch Biochem Biophys. 2007 Dec 1;468(1):100-6. doi: 10.1016/j.abb.2007.09.013.

MBL may be immunophenotypically similar to chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) and, like CLL, the prevalence is higher in males and older individuals. We studied the prevalence of MBL in blood donors from the Midwestern United States. Samples from 5141 donors were examined and seven (0.14%) were found to have immunophenotypic characteristics of MBL or CLL. Immunoglobulin heavy chain analysis yielded monoclonality or oligoclonality. Prior and subsequent to the study, an additional undetermined number of blood donors were screened and seven of these expressed immunophenotypic characteristics of MBL or CLL. We thus found a total of 14 healthy blood donors with monoclonal expansions of B-lymphocyte populations. Of these, 12 were presumptively classified as MBL and two as CLL. All but two of the donors were male; the mean age was 59 years.

Reports suggesting elevated CLL rates in the rubber and petroleum industries point to a possible role for solvents and other chemicals. The few studies that focus on specific chemicals suggest that CLL should be more carefully evaluated in relation to possible exposure to chemicals and solvents, particularly for benzene and butadiene.

METHODS: The authors report on the incidence and risk factors for development of symptomatic cytomegalovirus reactivation in 113 patients with chronic lymphoproliferative disorders who received alemtuzumab-based therapy. Kaplan-Meier methods were applied to generate survival curves, and the log-rank test was used to assess the difference between groups; in addition, univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate the hazard ratio of death including 95% confidence intervals. RESULTS: Cytomegalovirus reactivation was diagnosed in 25 patients (22%), and most of those patients responded to antiviral therapy. Nine additional patients had asymptomatic cytomegalovirus viremia. CONCLUSIONS: With appropriate therapy, most patients achieved clearance of cytomegalovirus viremia.

PKC412 inhibits the growth of leukemic cell lines with FLT3 mutations such as the MV4-11. This study evaluated the in vitro effects of the combination of PKC412 and ara-C or daunorubicin, studying the effect of co-incubation, pre-incubation and sequential incubation of the drugs in patient samples and cell lines. Thirty-three patients with AML were included. Two cell lines were studied; MV4-11 that expresses the FLT3/ITD and HL-60 that does not. In the patient cells PKC412 exerted its effect at concentrations between 0.1 and 2.0 microM. For MV4-11 cells concentrations down to 1 nM were effective. In patient samples, the results of co-incubation of PKC412 with ara-C were synergistic in 5%, additive in 67%, sub additive in 17% and antagonistic in 11% of the cases. In patient cells, incubations with ara-C and PKC412 resulted in synergistic effects in 17% of the FLT3/ITD positive samples compared to 0% synergistic in the FLT3/ITD negative samples (p < 0.01). Antagonistic effects were more common in the FLT3/ITD negative samples. The timing of the drugs had little impact on the effect. In cell lines, antagonistic effects were seen frequently in HL-60 (90%) and less so in MV4-11 (60%) regardless of sequence or timing of the drugs. The combination of daunorubicin and PKC412 resulted in more synergistic and less antagonistic effects compared to combinations with ara-C, in both patient material and cell lines. The combination of Lonafarnib, a farnesyl-transferase inhibitor (FTI) and PKC412 had additive and synergistic effects in both FLT3/ITD positive and negative cell lines. In conclusion, the combination of PKC412 together with chemotherapeutic drugs is more effective in FLT3/ITD positive AML cells. Antagonistic effects can be seen, especially in patient samples without FLT3/ITD. Also, the combination of PKC412 and the farnesylinhibitor lonafarnib should be further explored.","['Mollgard, Lars', 'Deneberg, Stefan', 'Nahi, Hareth', 'Bengtzen, Sofia', 'Jonsson-Videsater, Kerstin', 'Fioretos, Thoas', 'Andersson, Anna', 'Paul, Christer', 'Lehmann, Soren']","['Mollgard L', 'Deneberg S', 'Nahi H', 'Bengtzen S', 'Jonsson-Videsater K', 'Fioretos T', 'Andersson A', 'Paul C', 'Lehmann S']","['Department of Hematology, Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20071025,Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)', 'ID912S5VON (midostaurin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/enzymology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Staurosporine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics']",2007/10/26 09:00,2008/09/05 09:00,['2007/10/26 09:00'],"['2007/07/03 00:00 [received]', '2007/10/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/10/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/05 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/26 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00280-007-0623-4 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2008 Aug;62(3):439-48. doi: 10.1007/s00280-007-0623-4.

In 32D cells, expression levels of retrovirally transduced BCR-ABL were positively correlated with the levels of the cell cycle regulator protein p21, and this upregulation of p21 expression depended on the kinase activity of BCR-ABL. To assess the role of p21 on BCR-ABL-positive hematopoietic cells, we compared proliferation and drug-induced apoptosis in bone marrow (BM) cells from wild-type and p21 knockout mice after retroviral transfer of the BCR-ABL fusion gene. As compared with wild-type cells, p21 knockout cells showed increased proliferation, suggesting that p21 acted as an attenuator of BCR-ABL-mediated cell proliferation. In marked contrast, deletion of p21 promoted apoptosis induction by imatinib and taxol in BCR-ABL-transformed BM cells. These findings demonstrate that p21 has a dual function in BCR-ABL-transformed murine BM cells: It attenuates the effects of two apparently opposed phenomena such as BCR-ABL-mediated cell proliferation and drug-induced apoptosis. This dual function of p21 calls for a cautious evaluation of the suitability of p21 as a secondary target in anticancer therapy.","['Forster, Karin', 'Obermeier, Axel', 'Mitina, Olga', 'Simon, Nicola', 'Warmuth, Markus', 'Krause, Gunter', 'Hallek, Michael']","['Forster K', 'Obermeier A', 'Mitina O', 'Simon N', 'Warmuth M', 'Krause G', 'Hallek M']","['Clinical Cooperation Group Gene Therapy, GSF-Research Center for Environment and Health, Marchioninistrasse 25, 81377, Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071025,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Cdkn1a protein, mouse)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Tubulin Modulators)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/genetics', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*enzymology/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Paclitaxel/*pharmacology', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Retroviridae', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Tubulin Modulators/*pharmacology']",2007/10/26 09:00,2008/04/12 09:00,['2007/10/26 09:00'],"['2007/06/26 00:00 [received]', '2007/09/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/10/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/12 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/26 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00277-007-0400-9 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2008 Mar;87(3):183-93. doi: 10.1007/s00277-007-0400-9.

The system utilizes actuation of Braille-display pins for micro-scale fluid manipulation and a fluorescence microscope with a CCD camera for optical detection. The microfluidic chip is fully disposable and is composed of a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) slab with microchannel features sealed against a thin deformable PDMS membrane. The channels are designed with diffusers to alleviate pulsatile flow behaviors inherent in pin actuator-based peristaltic pumping schemes to maximize hydrodynamic focusing of samples with minimal disturbances in the laminar streams within the channel. A funnel connected to the microfluidic channel is designed for efficient loading of samples with small number of cells and is also positioned on the chip to prevent physical damages of the samples by the squeezing actions of Braille pins during actuation. The sample loading scheme was characterized by both computational fluidic dynamics (CFD) simulation and experimental observation. A fluorescein solution was first used for flow field investigation, followed by use of fluorescence beads with known relative intensities for optical detection performance calibration. Murine myoblast cells (C2C12) were exploited to investigate cell viability for the sample loading scheme of the device. Furthermore, human promyelocytic leukemia (HL60) cells stained by hypotonic DNA staining buffer were also tested in the system for cell cycle analysis. The ability to efficiently analyze cellular samples where the number of cells is small was demonstrated by analyzing cells from a single embryoid body derived from mouse embryonic stem cells. Consequently, the designed microfluidic device reported in this paper is promising for easy-to-use, small sample size flow cytometric analysis, and has potential to be further integrated with other Braille display-based microfluidic devices to facilitate a multi-functional lab-on-a-chip for mammalian cell manipulations.","['Tung, Yi-Chung', 'Torisawa, Yu-suke', 'Futai, Nobuyuki', 'Takayama, Shuichi']","['Tung YC', 'Torisawa YS', 'Futai N', 'Takayama S']","['Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109-2099, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20070815,England,Lab Chip,Lab on a chip,101128948,"['0 (Dimethylpolysiloxanes)', '0 (Silicones)', '63148-62-9 (baysilon)']",IM,"['Cell Cycle', 'Cell Survival', 'Dimethylpolysiloxanes/chemistry', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Microfluidics/*instrumentation', 'Optics and Photonics', 'Silicones/chemistry', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence']",2007/10/26 09:00,2008/01/30 09:00,['2007/10/26 09:00'],"['2007/10/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/30 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/26 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1039/b708187a [doi]'],ppublish,Lab Chip. 2007 Nov;7(11):1497-503. doi: 10.1039/b708187a.

Hematopoietic stem cells bearing inactivating mutations of FA complementation group C (FANCC) are genetically unstable and hypersensitive to apoptotic cytokine cues including IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha, but neoplastic stem cell clones that arise frequently in vivo are resistant to these cytokines. Reasoning that the combination of genetic instability and cytokine hypersensitivity might create an environment supporting the emergence of leukemic stem cells, we tested the leukemia-promoting effects of TNF-alpha in murine stem cells. TNF-alpha exposure initially profoundly inhibited the growth of Fancc-/- stem cells. However, longer-term exposure of these cells promoted the outgrowth of cytogenetically abnormal clones that, upon transplantation into congenic WT mice, led to acute myelogenous leukemia. TNF-alpha induced ROS-dependent genetic instability in Fancc-/- but not in WT cells. The leukemic clones were TNF-alpha resistant but retained their characteristic hypersensitivity to mitomycin C and exhibited high levels of chromosomal instability. Expression of FANCC cDNA in Fancc-/- stem cells protected them from TNF-alpha-induced clonal evolution. We conclude that TNF-alpha exposure creates an environment in which somatically mutated preleukemic stem cell clones are selected and from which unaltered TNF-alpha-hypersensitive Fancc-/- stem cells are purged.","['Li, June', 'Sejas, Daniel P', 'Zhang, Xiaoling', 'Qiu, Yuhui', 'Nattamai, Kalpana J', 'Rani, Reena', 'Rathbun, Keaney R', 'Geiger, Hartmut', 'Williams, David A', 'Bagby, Grover C', 'Pang, Qishen']","['Li J', 'Sejas DP', 'Zhang X', 'Qiu Y', 'Nattamai KJ', 'Rani R', 'Rathbun KR', 'Geiger H', 'Williams DA', 'Bagby GC', 'Pang Q']","[""Division of Experimental Hematology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Department of Pediatrics, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, Ohio 45229, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (Fancc protein, mouse)', '0 (Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group C Protein)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Fanconi Anemia/genetics/*immunology', 'Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group C Protein/genetics/*immunology', 'Genetic Complementation Test', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*physiology', 'Humans', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Survival Rate', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*immunology']",2007/10/26 09:00,2008/04/03 09:00,['2007/10/26 09:00'],"['2007/02/12 00:00 [received]', '2007/07/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/10/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/03 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/26 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1172/JCI31772 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Invest. 2007 Nov;117(11):3283-95. doi: 10.1172/JCI31772.,,"['M01 RR000334/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 HL048546/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA109641/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL076712/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC2040318,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SHM analysis was performed for all 1290 CLL sequences in this cohort with less than 100% identity to germ line. At the cohort level, SHM patterns were typical of a canonical SHM process. However, important differences emerged from the analysis of certain subgroups of CLL sequences defined by: (1) IGHV gene usage, (2) presence of stereotyped heavy chain complementarity-determining region 3 (HCDR3) sequences, and (3) mutational load. Recurrent, ""stereotyped"" amino acid changes occurred across the entire IGHV region in CLL subsets carrying stereotyped HCDR3 sequences, especially those expressing the IGHV3-21 and IGHV4-34 genes. These mutations are underrepresented among non-CLL sequences and thus can be considered as CLL-biased. Furthermore, it was shown that even a low level of mutations may be functionally relevant, given that stereotyped amino acid changes can be found in subsets of minimally mutated cases.

We conducted a phase 1 trial of ATO in children (median age 13 y, range, 2-19) with refractory leukemia. ATO was administered intravenously over 2 hours, 5 d/wk for 20 doses/cycle. Patients with APL (n=13) received 0.15 mg/kg per day, and patients with other types of leukemia received 0.15 mg/kg per day (n=2) or 0.2 mg/kg per day (n=4). Nineteen of the 24 enrolled patients were fully evaluable for toxicity.

At 0.2 mg/kg per day, 2 of 4 patients had dose-limiting QTc prolongation or pancreatitis. Non-dose-limiting toxicities included elevated serum transaminases, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, constipation, electrolyte imbalance, hyperglycemia, dermatitis, and headache. At 0.15 mg/kg per day, the median (range) plasma arsenic maximum concentration (Cmax) was 0.28 microM (0.11-0.37 microM) and at 0.2 mg/kg per day, Cmax was 0.40 and 0.46 microM; area under the concentration times time curve (AUC0-24) was 2.50 microM-hr (1.28-3.85 microM-hr) and 4.37 microM-hr and 4.69 microM-hr, respectively. Morphologic complete response (CR) was achieved in 85% of patients with APL; no responses were observed in non-APL patients.

We evaluated its relevance as independent prognosticator for overall survival and time to treatment (TTT) in a series of 303 (232 for TTT) CLLs, in comparison with other biologic or clinical prognosticators (CD38, ZAP-70, immunoglobulin variable heavy chain (IGHV) gene status, cytogenetic abnormalities, soluble CD23, beta2-microglobulin, Rai staging). Flow cytometric detection of CD49d was stable and reproducible, and the chosen cut-off (30% CLL cells) easily discriminated CD49dlow from CD49dhigh cases. CD49d, whose expression was strongly associated with that of CD38 (P<.001) and ZAP-70 (P<.001), or with IGHV mutations (P<.001), was independent prognosticator for overall survival along with IGHV mutational status (CD49d hazard ratio, HRCD49d=3.52, P=.02; HRIGHV=6.53, P<.001) or, if this parameter was omitted, with ZAP-70 (HRCD49d=3.72, P=.002; HRZAP-70=3.32, P=.009). CD49d was also a prognosticator for TTT (HR=1.74, P=.007) and refined the impact of all the other factors. Notably, a CD49dhigh phenotype, although not changing the outcome of good prognosis (ZAP-70low, mutated IGHV) CLL, was necessary to correctly prognosticate the shorter TTT of ZAP-70high (HR=3.12; P=.023) or unmutated IGHV (HR=2.95; P=.002) cases. These findings support the introduction of CD49d detection in routine prognostic assessment of CLL patients, and suggest both pathogenetic and therapeutic implications for CD49d expression in CLL.","['Gattei, Valter', 'Bulian, Pietro', 'Del Principe, Maria Ilaria', 'Zucchetto, Antonella', 'Maurillo, Luca', 'Buccisano, Francesco', 'Bomben, Riccardo', 'Dal-Bo, Michele', 'Luciano, Fabrizio', 'Rossi, Francesca M', 'Degan, Massimo', 'Amadori, Sergio', 'Del Poeta, Giovanni']","['Gattei V', 'Bulian P', 'Del Principe MI', 'Zucchetto A', 'Maurillo L', 'Buccisano F', 'Bomben R', 'Dal-Bo M', 'Luciano F', 'Rossi FM', 'Degan M', 'Amadori S', 'Del Poeta G']","['Clinical and Experimental Onco-Hematology Unit, Centro di Riferimento Oncologico, Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico Aviano, Italy. vgattei@cro.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071024,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '143198-26-9 (Integrin alpha4)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/genetics', 'Humans', 'Integrin alpha4/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*metabolism/*mortality/pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Phenotype', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate']",2007/10/26 09:00,2008/03/12 09:00,['2007/10/26 09:00'],"['2007/10/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/12 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)48506-4 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2007-05-092486 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2008 Jan 15;111(2):865-73. doi: 10.1182/blood-2007-05-092486.

However, the contribution of G protein-coupled receptor signal transduction for MTOC polarity is less well understood. Here, we report that the heterotrimeric Galpha(12) and Galpha(13) proteins are necessary for MTOC polarity and microtubule dynamics based on studies using Galpha(12/13)-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Cell polarization involves the Galpha(12/13)-interacting leukemia-associated RhoGEF (LARG) and the actin-nucleating diaphanous formin mDia1. Interestingly, LARG associates with pericentrin and localizes to the MTOC and along microtubule tracks. We propose that Galpha(12/13) proteins exert essential functions linking extracellular signals to microtubule dynamics and cell polarity via RhoGEF and formin activity.","['Goulimari, Polyxeni', 'Knieling, Helga', 'Engel, Ulrike', 'Grosse, Robert']","['Goulimari P', 'Knieling H', 'Engel U', 'Grosse R']","['Institute of Pharmacology, University of Heidelberg, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071024,United States,Mol Biol Cell,Molecular biology of the cell,9201390,"['0 (Antigens)', '0 (Arhgef12 protein, mouse)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Diap1 protein, mouse)', '0 (EB1 microtubule binding proteins)', '0 (EB3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Formins)', '0 (Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Rho Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors)', '0 (pericentrin)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Gsk3b protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.26 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3)', 'EC 3.6.5.1 (GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, G12-G13)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rhoA GTP-Binding Protein)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens/metabolism', 'Carrier Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cell Movement', '*Cell Polarity', 'Fibroblasts/*cytology/enzymology', 'Formins', 'GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, G12-G13/*metabolism', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3/metabolism', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta', 'Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/metabolism', 'Microtubule-Organizing Center/metabolism', 'Microtubules/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Rho Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors', 'rhoA GTP-Binding Protein/metabolism']",2007/10/26 09:00,2008/11/11 09:00,['2007/10/26 09:00'],"['2007/10/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/11/11 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['E06-11-1045 [pii]', '10.1091/mbc.e06-11-1045 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Biol Cell. 2008 Jan;19(1):30-40. doi: 10.1091/mbc.e06-11-1045.

Abl is best known for its roles in axon guidance, but Abl and its relatives also help regulate embryonic morphogenesis in epithelial tissues. Here, we explore the role of regulation of Abl kinase activity during development. We first compare the subcellular localization of Abl protein and of active Abl, by using a phosphospecific antibody, providing a catalog of places where Abl is activated. Next, we explore the consequences for morphogenesis of overexpressing wild-type Abl or expressing the activated form found in leukemia, Bcr-Abl. We find dose-dependent effects of elevating Abl activity on morphogenetic movements such as head involution and dorsal closure, on cell shape changes, on cell protrusive behavior, and on the organization of the actin cytoskeleton. Most of the effects of Abl activation parallel those caused by reduction in function of its target Enabled. Abl activation leads to changes in Enabled phosphorylation and localization, suggesting a mechanism of action.

The last known endogenization events occurred several million years ago, and therefore stepwise analysis of retroviral endogenization has not been possible. A unique opportunity to study this process became available when a full-length ERV isolated from koalas (KoRV) was shown to have integrated into their germ line within the past 100 years. Even though KoRV shares 78% nucleotide identity with the exogenous and highly infectious gibbon ape leukemia virus (GALV), the infectivity of KoRV, like that of other ERVs, is substantially lower than that of GALV. Differences in the protein coding regions of KoRV that distinguish it from GALV were introduced into the GALV genome, and their functional consequences were assessed. We identified a KoRV gagpol L domain mutation as well as five residues present in the KoRV envelope (env) that, when substituted for the corresponding residues of GALV, resulted in vectors exhibiting substantially reduced titers similar to those observed with KoRV vectors. In addition, KoRV env protein lacks an intact CETTG motif that we have identified as invariant among highly infectious gammaretroviruses. Disruption of this motif in GALV results in vectors with reduced syncytia forming capabilities. Functional assessment of specific sequences that contribute to KoRV's attenuation from a highly infectious GALV-like progenitor virus has allowed the identification of specific modifications in the KoRV genome that correlate with its endogenization.","['Oliveira, Nidia M', 'Satija, Harshita', 'Kouwenhoven, I Arlette', 'Eiden, Maribeth V']","['Oliveira NM', 'Satija H', 'Kouwenhoven IA', 'Eiden MV']","['Laboratory of Cellular and Molecular Regulation, National Institute of Mental Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20071024,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,['0 (Viral Proteins)'],IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Genetic Vectors/genetics', 'Humans', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Retroviridae/genetics/*metabolism', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Structural Homology, Protein', 'Titrimetry', 'Viral Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism']",2007/10/26 09:00,2007/12/28 09:00,['2007/10/26 09:00'],"['2007/10/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/28 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['0704313104 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.0704313104 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2007 Oct 30;104(44):17506-11. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0704313104.

Cytotoxicity of methylating agents is mediated primarily by the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) system. Loss of MLH1, a major component of DNA MMR, results in tolerance to the cytotoxic effects of methylating agents and persistence of mutagenised cells at high risk of malignant transformation. We hypothesised that a common substitution in the basal promoter of MLH1 (position -93, rs1800734) modifies the risk of cancer after methylating chemotherapy. METHODS: 133 patients who developed cancer following chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy (n = 133), 420 patients diagnosed with de novo myeloid leukaemia, 242 patients diagnosed with primary Hodgkin lymphoma, and 1177 healthy controls were genotyped for the MLH1 -93 polymorphism by allelic discrimination polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and restriction fragment length polymorphism assay. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for cancer risk by MLH1 -93 polymorphism status, and stratified by previous exposure to methylating chemotherapy, were calculated using unconditional logistic regression. RESULTS: Carrier frequency of the MLH1 -93 variant was higher in patients who developed therapy related acute myeloid leukaemia (t-AML) (75.0%, n = 12) or breast cancer (53.3%. n = 15) after methylating chemotherapy for Hodgkin lymphoma compared to patients without previous methylating exposure (t-AML, 30.4%, n = 69; breast cancer patients, 27.2%, n = 22). The MLH1 -93 variant allele was also over-represented in t-AML cases when compared to de novo AML cases (36.9%, n = 420) and healthy controls (36.3%, n = 952), and was associated with a significantly increased risk of developing t-AML (odds ratio 5.31, 95% confidence interval 1.40 to 20.15), but only in patients previously treated with a methylating agent. CONCLUSIONS: These data support the hypothesis that the common polymorphism at position -93 in the core promoter of MLH1 defines a risk allele for the development of cancer after methylating chemotherapy for Hodgkin lymphoma. However, replication of this finding in larger studies is suggested.","['Worrillow, L J', 'Smith, A G', 'Scott, K', 'Andersson, M', 'Ashcroft, A J', 'Dores, G M', 'Glimelius, B', 'Holowaty, E', 'Jackson, G H', 'Jones, G L', 'Lynch, C F', 'Morgan, G', 'Pukkala, E', 'Scott, D', 'Storm, H H', 'Taylor, P R', 'Vyberg, M', 'Willett, E', 'Travis, L B', 'Allan, J M']","['Worrillow LJ', 'Smith AG', 'Scott K', 'Andersson M', 'Ashcroft AJ', 'Dores GM', 'Glimelius B', 'Holowaty E', 'Jackson GH', 'Jones GL', 'Lynch CF', 'Morgan G', 'Pukkala E', 'Scott D', 'Storm HH', 'Taylor PR', 'Vyberg M', 'Willett E', 'Travis LB', 'Allan JM']","['Department of Biology, University of York, Heslington, York, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071024,England,J Med Genet,Journal of medical genetics,2985087R,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (MLH1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', 'EC 3.6.1.3 (MutL Protein Homolog 1)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/*genetics', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Alleles', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/*adverse effects', 'Base Sequence', 'Case-Control Studies', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'DNA Repair/genetics', 'Female', 'Hodgkin Disease/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/chemically induced/etiology/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'MutL Protein Homolog 1', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/chemically induced/*etiology/genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Risk Factors']",2007/10/26 09:00,2008/04/04 09:00,['2007/10/26 09:00'],"['2007/10/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/04 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['jmg.2007.053850 [pii]', '10.1136/jmg.2007.053850 [doi]']",ppublish,J Med Genet. 2008 Mar;45(3):142-6. doi: 10.1136/jmg.2007.053850.

We found that numerous mouse-passaged FV isolates also contained LDV and that coinfection with LDV delayed FV-specific CD8(+) T-cell responses during acute infection. While LDV did not alter the type of acute pathology induced by FV, which was severe splenomegaly caused by erythroproliferation, the immunosuppression mediated by LDV increased both the severity and the duration of FV infection. Compared to mice infected with FV alone, those coinfected with both FV and LDV had delayed CD8(+) T-cell responses, as measured by FV-specific tetramers. This delayed response accounted for the prolonged and exacerbated acute phase of FV infection. Suppression of FV-specific CD8(+) T-cell responses occurred not only in mice infected concomitantly with LDV but also in mice chronically infected with LDV 8 weeks prior to infection with FV. The LDV-induced suppression was not mediated by T regulatory cells, and no inhibition of the CD4(+) T-cell or antibody responses was observed. Considering that most human adults are carriers of chronically infectious viruses at the time of new virus insults and that coinfections with viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis C virus are currently epidemic, it is of great interest to determine how infection with one virus may impact host responses to a second infection. Coinfection of mice with LDV and FV provides a well-defined, natural host model for such studies.","['Robertson, Shelly J', 'Ammann, Christoph G', 'Messer, Ronald J', 'Carmody, Aaron B', 'Myers, Lara', 'Dittmer, Ulf', 'Nair, Savita', 'Gerlach, Nicole', 'Evans, Leonard H', 'Cafruny, William A', 'Hasenkrug, Kim J']","['Robertson SJ', 'Ammann CG', 'Messer RJ', 'Carmody AB', 'Myers L', 'Dittmer U', 'Nair S', 'Gerlach N', 'Evans LH', 'Cafruny WA', 'Hasenkrug KJ']","['Laboratory of Persistent Viral Diseases, Rocky Mountain Laboratories, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Hamilton, MT 59840, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071024,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/immunology', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Female', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/*immunology', '*Immune Tolerance', 'Lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/virology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/virology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Retroviridae Infections/immunology/pathology', 'Splenomegaly/virology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/immunology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/immunology/pathology']",2007/10/26 09:00,2008/01/11 09:00,['2007/10/26 09:00'],"['2007/10/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/11 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['JVI.01413-07 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.01413-07 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2008 Jan;82(1):408-18. doi: 10.1128/JVI.01413-07.

The tumor growth inhibition and general condition of the nude mice were observed, and in situ TUNEL assay and immunohistochemistry were performed on the transplanted tumors. RESULTS: Bortezomib alone and in combination with arsenic trioxide could both inhibit the growth of the transplanted tumors, prolong the survival of the nude mice, and induce cell apoptosis and growth inhibition of the HL-60 cells in vivo, and the combined administration exhibited even better effects. The administration was well tolerated with causing manifest vital organ damages in the mice.

Nilotinib is a selective Bcr/Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor related to imatinib, which is widely used to treat chronic myelogenous leukemia. Because Ph-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia only responds transiently to imatinib therapy, we have used mouse models to test the efficacy of nilotinib against lymphoblastic leukemia caused by the P190 form of Bcr/Abl. RESULTS: After transplant of 10,000 highly malignant leukemic cells into compatible recipients, untreated mice succumbed to leukemia within 21 days, whereas mice treated with 75 mg/kg nilotinib survived significantly longer. We examined cells from mice that developed leukemia while under treatment for Bcr/Abl kinase domain point mutations but these were not detected. In addition, culture of such cells ex vivo showed that they were as sensitive as the parental cell line to nilotinib but that the presence of stromal support allowed resistant cells to grow out. Nilotinib also exhibited impressive anti-leukemia activity in P190 Bcr/Abl transgenic mice that had developed overt leukemia/lymphoma masses and that otherwise would have been expected to die within 7 days. Visible lymphoma masses disappeared within six days of treatment and leukemic cell numbers in peripheral blood were significantly reduced. Treated mice survived more than 30 days. CONCLUSION: These results show that nilotinib has very impressive anti-leukemia activity but that lymphoblastic leukemia cells can become unresponsive to it both in vitro and in vivo through mechanisms that appear to be Bcr/Abl independent.","['Kaur, Pavinder', 'Feldhahn, Niklas', 'Zhang, Bin', 'Trageser, Daniel', 'Muschen, Markus', 'Pertz, Veerle', 'Groffen, John', 'Heisterkamp, Nora']","['Kaur P', 'Feldhahn N', 'Zhang B', 'Trageser D', 'Muschen M', 'Pertz V', 'Groffen J', 'Heisterkamp N']","['Section of Molecular Carcinogenesis, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Saban Research Institute, Childrens Hospital Los Angeles and the Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California, USA. pavinder@gmail.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071025,England,Mol Cancer,Molecular cancer,101147698,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl', 'Janus Kinase 2/drug effects/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Stromal Cells/drug effects/metabolism']",2007/10/26 09:00,2008/02/01 09:00,['2007/10/26 09:00'],"['2007/06/19 00:00 [received]', '2007/10/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/10/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/01 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['1476-4598-6-67 [pii]', '10.1186/1476-4598-6-67 [doi]']",epublish,Mol Cancer. 2007 Oct 25;6:67. doi: 10.1186/1476-4598-6-67.,,"['R01 CA090321/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 090321/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC2169263,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This necessitates the availability of leukapheresis (LP) facilities 7 days a week. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The efficacy of an approach where LP was invariably commenced on Day 11 after intermediate-dose cyclophosphamide followed by sequential administration of granulocyte-macrophage-colony-stimulating factor (CSF) and granulocyte-CSF (Cy/GM/G) was retrospectively analyzed in 225 consecutive, unselected patients undergoing autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for all diagnoses other than acute leukemia at our center. Cy/GM/G was scheduled to avoid weekend LP. RESULTS: After Cy/GM/G, a CD34+ cell yield of at least 2.0x10(6) per kg was achieved in 90.7 percent of patients. Optimal yield (OY; >or=5x10(6) or 10x10(6) CD34+ cells/kg depending on diagnosis) was achieved in 67.6 percent of patients. Only three patients (1.3%) required LP on Saturday or Sunday. Febrile neutropenia (FN) was encountered in 5.3 percent. PBPC yield was highest on Day 1 of LP (p<0.001). In multivariate analyses, platelet (PLT) count on Day 1 of LP (PLT-D1LP) was positively associated with achievement of OY (p<0.001). PLT-D1LP and diagnosis of myeloma were associated with a shorter time to achieve a CD34+ cell yield of at least 5x10(6) per kg (p<0.001 and p=0.002, respectively). CONCLUSION: Cy/GM/G with scheduled LP commencement on Day 11 enables optimal CD34+ cell yields in most patients undergoing autologous transplantation, despite a low risk of FN and avoidance of weekend LP.","['Bashey, Asad', 'Donohue, Michael', 'Liu, Lin', 'Medina, Bridget', 'Corringham, Sue', 'Ihasz, Anita', 'Carrier, Ewa', 'Castro, Januario E', 'Holman, Peter R', 'Xu, Ronghui', 'Law, Ping', 'Ball, Edward D', 'Lane, Thomas A']","['Bashey A', 'Donohue M', 'Liu L', 'Medina B', 'Corringham S', 'Ihasz A', 'Carrier E', 'Castro JE', 'Holman PR', 'Xu R', 'Law P', 'Ball ED', 'Lane TA']","['Division of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, and Biostatistics Core, Rebecca and John Moores UCSD Cancer Center, La Jolla, California, USA. abashey@bmtga.com']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Transfusion,Transfusion,0417360,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD34', 'Cyclophosphamide/*administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*administration & dosage', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*administration & dosage', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization/*methods', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', '*Leukapheresis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutropenia', 'Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation/methods', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",2007/10/26 09:00,2008/01/08 09:00,['2007/10/26 09:00'],"['2007/10/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/08 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['TRF01440 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1537-2995.2007.01440.x [doi]']",ppublish,Transfusion. 2007 Nov;47(11):2153-60. doi: 10.1111/j.1537-2995.2007.01440.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated the potential benefit of using STI571 to down-regulate Bcr-Abl activity for the enhancement of doxorubicin anti-proliferative action in K562 cell line derived from blast crisis of CML. At low concentrations of both drugs (40 nM doxorubicin combined with STI571 in the range of 100-150 nM), the antiproliferative effects were mainly due to cellular differentiation as assessed by benzidine staining for hemoglobin synthesis level and real-time PCR for gamma-globin expression. Higher concentrations of STI571 used in combinations with doxorubicin caused mainly apoptosis as shown by DNA degradation and nuclear fragmentation visualized by fluorescence microscopy after DAPI staining, changes in cell morphology observed after Giemza-May Grunwald staining and cellular membrane organization estimated by flow cytometry after Annexin V staining. As compared with either drug alone, cotreatment with STI571 and DOX induced stronger cellular responses. A low concentration of STI571 in combination with a low concentration of DOX might be tested as an alternative approach to increasing the efficacy of chemotherapy against CML.","['Jakubowska, Justyna', 'Stasiak, Marta', 'Szulawska, Agata', 'Bednarek, Andrzej', 'Czyz, Malgorzata']","['Jakubowska J', 'Stasiak M', 'Szulawska A', 'Bednarek A', 'Czyz M']","['Department of Molecular Biology of Cancer, Medical University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071025,Poland,Acta Biochim Pol,Acta biochimica Polonica,14520300R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Base Sequence', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Division/*drug effects', 'DNA Primers', 'Doxorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*pathology', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology']",2007/10/25 09:00,2008/08/22 09:00,['2007/10/25 09:00'],"['2007/07/09 00:00 [received]', '2007/09/16 00:00 [revised]', '2007/10/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/10/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/22 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/25 09:00 [entrez]']",['20071509 [pii]'],ppublish,Acta Biochim Pol. 2007;54(4):839-46.

Gene inactivation studies in mice demonstrate that ATRX is an essential protein and suggest that patient mutations likely retain partial activity. ATRX associates with the nuclear matrix, pericentromeric heterochromatin, and promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies (PML-NBs) in a speckled nuclear staining pattern. Here, we used GFP-ATRX fusion proteins to identify the specific domains of ATRX necessary for subnuclear targeting and the effect of patient mutations on this localization. We identified two functional nuclear localization signals (NLSs) and two domains that target ATRX to nuclear speckles. One of the latter domains is responsible for targeting ATRX to PML-NBs. Surprisingly, this domain encompassed motifs IV-VI of the SNF2 domain suggesting that in addition to chromatin remodeling, it may also have a role in subnuclear targeting. More importantly, four different patient mutations within this domain resulted in an approximately 80% reduction in the number of transfected cells with ATRX nuclear speckles and PML colocalization. These results demonstrate that patient mutations have a dramatic effect on subnuclear targeting to PML-NBs. Moreover, these findings support the hypothesis that ATRX patient mutations represent functional hypomorphs and suggest that loss of proper targeting to PML-NBs is an important contributor to the pathogenesis of the ATR-X syndrome.","['Berube, Nathalie G', 'Healy, Jasmine', 'Medina, Chantal F', 'Wu, Shaobo', 'Hodgson, Todd', 'Jagla, Magdalena', 'Picketts, David J']","['Berube NG', 'Healy J', 'Medina CF', 'Wu S', 'Hodgson T', 'Jagla M', 'Picketts DJ']","['Molecular Medicine Program, Ottawa Health Research Institute, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071024,England,Eur J Hum Genet,European journal of human genetics : EJHG,9302235,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.4.- (DNA Helicases)', 'EC 3.6.4.12 (ATRX protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.4.12 (X-linked Nuclear Protein)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Nucleus/*genetics', 'DNA Helicases/*genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Targeting', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Intranuclear Inclusion Bodies/*metabolism', 'Mental Retardation, X-Linked/genetics/pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/physiology', 'Sequence Deletion/*genetics', 'Syndrome', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*genetics/*metabolism', 'X-linked Nuclear Protein']",2007/10/25 09:00,2008/04/23 09:00,['2007/10/25 09:00'],"['2007/10/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/23 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['5201943 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.ejhg.5201943 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Hum Genet. 2008 Feb;16(2):192-201. doi: 10.1038/sj.ejhg.5201943.

The expression of mdr 1 mRNA and P-gp can be reduced through inhibiting NF-kappaB in K562/A02 cells, so that the sensitivity of chemical therapy can be enhanced on hematologic malignant cells.","['Wang, Yi', 'Liu, Xin', 'Zhang, Hai-Tao', 'Yu, Min', 'Wang, Hui']","['Wang Y', 'Liu X', 'Zhang HT', 'Yu M', 'Wang H']","[""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an 710061, China.""]",['chi'],['Journal Article'],,China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,"['0 (ABCB1 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Pyrrolidines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Thiocarbamates)', '25769-03-3 (pyrrolidine dithiocarbamic acid)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B', 'ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*metabolism', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/*drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'NF-kappa B/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Pyrrolidines/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Thiocarbamates/pharmacology']",2007/10/25 09:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2007/10/25 09:00'],"['2007/10/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]', '2007/10/25 09:00 [entrez]']",['1009-2137(2007)05-0950-05 [pii]'],ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2007 Oct;15(5):950-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The real-time quantitative PCR method was used to analyze the expression level of beta-catenin and bcr/abl. The expression level of beta-catenin and bcr/abl in different phases of CML was compared and the correlation was analyzed between the two genes. The results showed that the beta-catenin gene in BMMNC of blast crisis of CML patients was expressed significantly higher than that in chronic phase (p < 0.001) and accelerated phase (p = 0.016) of CML patients and in normal donors (p = 0.004).

This rearrangement results in the fusion of ETV6 (TEL) and RUNX1 (AML1) genes and defines a relatively uniform category, although only some patients suffer very late relapse. TEL/AML1-positive patients are thus an interesting subgroup to study, and such studies should elucidate the biological processes underlying TEL/AML1 pathogenesis. We report an analysis of gene expression in 60 children with B-lineage ALL using Agilent whole genome oligo-chips (44K-G4112A) and/or real time RT-PCR. RESULTS: We compared the leukemia cell gene expression profiles of 16 TEL/AML1-positive ALL patients to those of 44 TEL/AML1-negative patients, whose blast cells did not contain any additional recurrent translocation. Microarray analyses of 26 samples allowed the identification of genes differentially expressed between the TEL/AML1-positive and negative ALL groups. Gene enrichment analysis defined five enriched GO categories: cell differentiation, cell proliferation, apoptosis, cell motility and response to wounding, associated with 14 genes -RUNX1, TCFL5, TNFRSF7, CBFA2T3, CD9, SCARB1, TP53INP1, ACVR1C, PIK3C3, EGFL7, SEMA6A, CTGF, LSP1, TFPI - highlighting the biology of the TEL/AML1 sub-group. These results were first confirmed by the analysis of an additional microarray data-set (7 patient samples) and second by real-time RT-PCR quantification and clustering using an independent set (27 patient samples). Over-expression of RUNX1 (AML1) was further investigated and in one third of the patients correlated with cytogenetic findings. CONCLUSION: Gene expression analyses of leukemia cells from 60 children with TEL/AML1-positive and -negative B-lineage ALL led to the identification of five biological processes, associated with 14 validated genes characterizing and highlighting the biology of the TEL/AML1-positive ALL sub-group.","['Gandemer, Virginie', 'Rio, Anne-Gaelle', 'de Tayrac, Marie', 'Sibut, Vonnick', 'Mottier, Stephanie', 'Ly Sunnaram, Beatrice', 'Henry, Catherine', 'Monnier, Annabelle', 'Berthou, Christian', 'Le Gall, Edouard', 'Le Treut, Andre', 'Schmitt, Claudine', 'Le Gall, Jean-Yves', 'Mosser, Jean', 'Galibert, Marie-Dominique']","['Gandemer V', 'Rio AG', 'de Tayrac M', 'Sibut V', 'Mottier S', 'Ly Sunnaram B', 'Henry C', 'Monnier A', 'Berthou C', 'Le Gall E', 'Le Treut A', 'Schmitt C', 'Le Gall JY', 'Mosser J', 'Galibert MD']","['CNRS UMR 6061 Laboratoire de Genetique et Developpement, Equipe Regulation transcriptionnelle et oncogenese, Universite de Rennes-1, Faculte de Medecine, IFR140 GFAS, 2 av du Pr Leon Bernard, CS 34317, Rennes cedex, France. virginie.gandemer@chu-rennes.fr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071023,England,BMC Genomics,BMC genomics,100965258,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (TEL-AML1 fusion protein)']",IM,"['Child', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 12', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*methods', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Models, Biological', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/pathology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Translocation, Genetic/genetics']",2007/10/25 09:00,2008/02/05 09:00,['2007/10/25 09:00'],"['2007/01/31 00:00 [received]', '2007/10/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/10/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/05 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['1471-2164-8-385 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2164-8-385 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Genomics. 2007 Oct 23;8:385. doi: 10.1186/1471-2164-8-385.,,,,,PMC2211320,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The disease starts in CP (chronic phase), but as a result of genomic instability, it progresses over time to accelerated phase and then to BC (blast crisis), becoming increasingly resistant to therapy. bcr-abl is a constitutively active tyrosine kinase that has been targeted by TKIs (tyrosine kinase inhibitors), including IM (imatinib mesylate), nilotinib and dasatinib. We have developed various flow cytometry techniques to enable us to isolate candidate CML stem cells from CP patients at diagnosis that efflux Hoechst dye, express CD34, lack CD38 and are cytokine-non-responsive in culture over periods of up to 12 days in growth factors. These stem cells have been shown to regenerate bcr-abl-positive haemopoiesis in immunocompromised mice upon transplantation. We previously demonstrated that IM was antiproliferative for CML stem cells but did not induce apoptosis. Clinical experience now confirms that IM may not target CML stem cells in vivo with few patients achieving complete molecular remission and relapse occurring rapidly upon drug withdrawal. Our recent efforts have focused on understanding why CML stem cells are resistant to IM and on trying to find novel ways to induce apoptosis of this population. We have shown that CML stem cells express very high levels of functional wild-type bcr-abl; no kinase domain mutations have been detected in the stem cell population. Dasatinib, a more potent multitargeted TKI than IM, inhibits bcr-abl activity more efficiently than IM but still does not induce apoptosis of the stem cell population. Most recently, we have tested a number of novel drug combinations and found that FTIs (farnesyl transferase inhibitors) have activity against CML. BMS-214662 is the most effective of these and induces apoptosis of phenotypically and functionally defined CML stem cells in vitro, as a single agent and in combination with IM or dasatinib. The effect against CML stem cells is selective with little effect on normal stem cells. The drug is also effective against BC CML stem cells and equally effective against wild-type and mutant bcr-abl, including the most resistant mutant T315I.

Direct block of hERG/I(Kr) channels by a large number of therapeutic compounds produces acLQTS [acquired LQTS (long QT syndrome)] characterized by drug-induced QT prolongation and torsades de pointes arrhythmias. The cardiotoxicity associated with unintended hERG block has prompted pharmaceutical companies to screen developmental compounds for hERG blockade and made hERG a major target in drug safety programmes. More recently, a novel form of acLQTS has been discovered that may go undetected in most conventional safety assays. Several therapeutic compounds have been identified that reduce hERG/I(Kr) currents not by direct block but by inhibition of hERG/I(Kr) trafficking to the cell surface. Important examples are antineoplastic Hsp90 (heat-shock protein 90) inhibitors such as (i) geldanamycin, (ii) the leukaemia drug arsenic trioxide, (iii) the antiprotozoical pentamidine, (iv) probucol, a cholesterol-lowering drug, and (v) fluoxetine, a widely used antidepressant. Increased awareness of drug-induced hERG trafficking defects will help to further reduce the potentially lethal adverse cardiac events associated with acLQTS.","['Dennis, A', 'Wang, L', 'Wan, X', 'Ficker, E']","['Dennis A', 'Wang L', 'Wan X', 'Ficker E']","['Rammelkamp Center for Education and Research, MetroHealth Campus, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH 44109, U.S.A.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,England,Biochem Soc Trans,Biochemical Society transactions,7506897,"['0 (ERG1 Potassium Channel)', '0 (Ether-A-Go-Go Potassium Channels)', '0 (HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (KCNH2 protein, human)']",IM,"['ERG1 Potassium Channel', 'Ether-A-Go-Go Potassium Channels/*metabolism', 'HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Long QT Syndrome/chemically induced/*metabolism', 'Protein Transport']",2007/10/25 09:00,2008/02/06 09:00,['2007/10/25 09:00'],"['2007/10/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['BST0351060 [pii]', '10.1042/BST0351060 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Soc Trans. 2007 Nov;35(Pt 5):1060-3. doi: 10.1042/BST0351060.,,,,,,,,28,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To date, most of the CLL research has been carried out using PB samples obtained from patients with established CLL, which have proved instrumental in characterizing the disease. However, while CLL cells appear to have a defect in apoptosis in vivo, they rapidly undergo apoptosis ex vivo, suggesting that CLL cells are dependent on microenvironmental signals to enhance cell survival. One approach used to define the cellular and molecular events that govern CLL has been the development of murine models that replicate the human disease. As well as providing a deeper understanding of the potential triggers for CLL, these models provide preclinical in vivo systems to test novel therapies.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: 39 AML patients (mean age 43.9-/+18.2 years) and 10 healthy volunteers were studied by simultaneous amplification of the MDR1 and beta2-microglobulin (beta2-M) mRNA, as an internal control. Semi-quantitative characterization of MDR1 expression was done using a 4-grade scoring system: negative (-/+), weakly positive(-/+), moderately positive (+), strongly positive(++), according to the intensity of the MDR1 and beta2-M bands. RESULTS: The amplification of the MDR1 in healthy individuals yielded no products in 9 samples and in 1 case a (-/+) reaction was observed. In AML patients, RT-PCR revealed no MDR1 product (normal level) in 19 (48.7%) and (+)/(++) reaction (overexpression) in 15 (38.5%) patients. In the remaining 5 (12.8%) patients a (-/+) reaction was found, comparable to that of the (-/+) healthy individual (the level of MDR1 expression could not be defined). MDR1 overexpression was seen in 73.3% of the M1/M2 patients, and only in 14.3% of the M3 and M4/M5 patients. Besides, the MDR1(- )/(-/+)patients were significantly younger than MDR1(+)/ (++) patients (mean age 38.4-/+19.5/43.0-/+8.7 years, versus 51.1-/+16.7/65.0-/+4.3 years). CONCLUSION: RT-PCR allows for the identification of patients with moderate and higher levels of MDR1 overexpression, while the weak positive reactions require additional testing. Besides, our data support the observation that the level of expression might be associated with the French-American-British (FAB) subtype of AML and with the age of the patients.","['Balatzenko, G', 'Stoimenov, A', 'Guenova, M', 'Galabova, I', 'Ganeva, P', 'Hodjadjik, D', 'Toshkov, S']","['Balatzenko G', 'Stoimenov A', 'Guenova M', 'Galabova I', 'Ganeva P', 'Hodjadjik D', 'Toshkov S']","['Laboratory of Cytogenetics and Molecular Biology, National Center of Haematology and Transfusiology, Sofia, Bulgaria.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Cyprus,J BUON,Journal of B.U.ON. : official journal of the Balkan Union of Oncology,100883428,,,,2007/10/24 09:00,2007/10/24 09:01,['2007/10/24 09:00'],"['2007/10/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/24 09:01 [medline]', '2007/10/24 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J BUON. 2002 Oct-Dec;7(4):355-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Wogonin (Wog) and nor-wogonin (N-Wog) are structurally related flavonoids, and respectively contain an OH and OCH(3) at C8. In leukemia HL-60 cells, N-Wog exhibited more-potent cytotoxicity than Wog according to the MTT and LDH release assays, and the IC(50) values of Wog and N-Wog in HL-60 cells were 67.5 +/- 2.1 and 21.7 +/- 1.5 microM, respectively. Apoptotic characteristics including DNA ladders, apoptotic bodies, and hypodiploid cells accompanied by the induction of caspase 3 protein processing appeared in Wog- and N-Wog-treated HL-60 cells. Interestingly, an increase in intracellular peroxide production was detected in N-Wog- but not Wog-treated HL-60 cells by the DCHF-DA assay, and the reduction of intracellular peroxide by catalase (CAT) induced by N-Wog significantly reduced the N-Wog- but not the Wog-induced cytotoxic effect according to the MTT assay in accordance with the blocking of DNA ladder formation and caspase 3 and PARP protein processing elicited by N-Wog.

As most important side effect opportunistic infections are mentioned. It is, however, unknown whether these complications often lead to problems in general patient care in the Netherlands. METHODS: To gain insight into the use and complications of alemtuzumab therapy, the alemtuzumab-treated CLL patients in 15 hospitals in the Netherlands were evaluated by means of a questionnaire. RESULTS: In the period from 31 October 2001 until 17 November 2005, 27 patients with CLL or prolymphocytic leukaemia (PLL), RAI stage I to IV, Binet stage A to C, received 32 treatments with alemtuzumab. The time from diagnosis until start of alemtuzumab treatment was 6 +/- 4.5 years (mean +/- SD ). The treatment lasted 11 +/- 7 weeks. Of the treatments, 41% could be administered for the full 12 weeks. The most frequent adverse events were fever (72%), shivering (47%), fatigue (22%) and dyspnoea (16%). Haematological side effects consisted of leucopenia (75%), thrombocytopenia (44%), and anaemia (13%). Infectious complications occurred in 12 of 32 (38%) treatments: pneumonia (25%; of which one Pneumocystis carini pneumonia and four Aspergillus infections), sepsis (9%; of which one Listeria), herpes zoster (9%), herpes simplex (6%), CMV reactivation (6%), meningitis (3%) and Guillain Barre (3%). The overall response was 53%, with complete remission in 13%, partial remission in 41%, stable disease in 25% and progressive disease in 13%, and lasted for 8.3 +/- 7.3 months.

We hypothesized that with new precise methods more cryptic karyotypic lesions can be uncovered that may show important clinical implications. We have applied 250K single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) arrays (SNP-A) to study chromosomal lesions in samples from 174 patients (94 MDS, 33 secondary acute myeloid leukemia [sAML], and 47 myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative disease [MDS/MPD]) and 76 controls. Using SNP-A, aberrations were found in around three-fourths of MDS, MDS/MPD, and sAML (vs 59%, 37%, 53% by MC; in 8% of patients MC was unsuccessful). Previously unrecognized lesions were detected in patients with normal MC and in those with known lesions. Moreover, segmental uniparental disomy (UPD) was found in 20% of MDS, 23% of sAML, and 35% of MDS/MPD patients, a lesion resulting in copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity undetectable by MC. The potential clinical significance of abnormalities detected by SNP-A, but not seen on MC, was demonstrated by their impact on overall survival. UPD involving chromosomes frequently affected by deletions may have prognostic implications similar to the deletions visible by MC. SNP-A-based karyotyping shows superior resolution for chromosomal defects, including UPD. This technique further complements MC to improve clinical prognosis and targeted therapies.","['Gondek, Lukasz P', 'Tiu, Ramon', ""O'Keefe, Christine L"", 'Sekeres, Mikkael A', 'Theil, Karl S', 'Maciejewski, Jaroslaw P']","['Gondek LP', 'Tiu R', ""O'Keefe CL"", 'Sekeres MA', 'Theil KS', 'Maciejewski JP']","['Experimental Hematology and Hematopoiesis Section, Taussig Cancer Center, Cleveland Clinic, OH, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071022,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Chromosomes, Human/*genetics', 'Cytogenetics', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/etiology/*genetics/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/complications/*genetics/pathology', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*genetics/pathology', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Uniparental Disomy/*genetics']",2007/10/24 09:00,2008/03/28 09:00,['2007/10/24 09:00'],"['2007/10/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/28 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)45410-2 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2007-05-092304 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2008 Feb 1;111(3):1534-42. doi: 10.1182/blood-2007-05-092304.
