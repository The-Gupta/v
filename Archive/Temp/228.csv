In this study we examined the expression of the two PGHS isoforms during phorbol ester induced monocytic differentiation of human myeloid leukemia cells (U937). Murine and ovine PGHS-1 probes hybridized to 2.8- and 5.5-kb mRNA species, whereas the murine PGHS-2 probe hybridized to a 5.3-kb species. Western blot analysis using antisera to mouse PGHS-1 and to a synthetic peptide derived from a mouse PGHS-2-specific region revealed a band of 70 kDa for PGHS-1 and a doublet of about 85 kDa for PGHS-2. Unlike PGHS-2, which was not expressed in U937 control cells, both PGHS-1 protein and mRNA were detected in untreated U937 cells. TPA strongly induced PGHS-2 protein and also increased the amount of PGHS-1 protein. Correspondingly, a marked induction of PGHS-2 mRNA was found, but virtually no change in the expression of the PGHS-1 2.8-kb mRNA occurred. The induction of both PGHS isoforms turned out to be dexamethasone-sensitive. The suppression of PGHS-2 induction was more pronounced. These results suggest that both PGHS-1 and to a larger extent PGHS-2 contribute to the upregulation of prostanoid synthesis during monocytic differentiation.","['Hoff, T', 'DeWitt, D', 'Kaever, V', 'Resch, K', 'Goppelt-Struebe, M']","['Hoff T', 'DeWitt D', 'Kaever V', 'Resch K', 'Goppelt-Struebe M']","['Institute of Molecular Pharmacology, Medical School Hannover, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,FEBS Lett,FEBS letters,0155157,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthases)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Mice', 'Monocytes/cytology/*enzymology', 'Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthases/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Sheep', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/03/29 00:00,1993/03/29 00:01,['1993/03/29 00:00'],"['1993/03/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/03/29 00:01 [medline]', '1993/03/29 00:00 [entrez]']","['0014-5793(93)81653-H [pii]', '10.1016/0014-5793(93)81653-h [doi]']",ppublish,FEBS Lett. 1993 Mar 29;320(1):38-42. doi: 10.1016/0014-5793(93)81653-h.,,,,,,,,,,

Here we demonstrate that hexamethylene bisacetamide (HMBA) induced K562 cells to differentiate along a third pathway. This was accompanied by downregulation of two transcription factors normally expressed in erythroid, mast and megakaryocyte lineages. Northern analysis demonstrated coordinate downregulation of alpha globin and gamma globin in addition to the two lineage-restricted transcription factors, SCL and GATA-1. Proliferation of the K562 cells was also suppressed. Clonal assay showed that the suppression was irreversible and appeared analogous to the commitment of murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells to terminal differentiation. In contrast to MEL cells, however, K562 cells acquired a macrophage-like morphology and exhibited a complete failure to generate benzidine-positive cells. Electron microscopy revealed a marked increase in granules resembling those specific for eosinophils. Surface marker analysis showed that HMBA-induced cells expressed reduced levels of glycophorin A, CD5, CD7 and CD11b. No upregulation of megakaryocyte or lymphoid markers occurred. Thus the response of K562 cells to HMBA may provide a useful experimental system for studying the molecular mechanisms responsible for downmodulation of lineage-restricted transcription factors during hemopoietic lineage commitment.","['Green, A R', 'Rockman, S', 'DeLuca, E', 'Begley, C G']","['Green AR', 'Rockman S', 'DeLuca E', 'Begley CG']","['Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Royal Melbourne Hospital, Victoria, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Acetamides)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Glycophorins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'LA133J59VU (hexamethylene bisacetamide)']",IM,"['Acetamides/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Erythrocytes/*cytology', 'Glycophorins/metabolism', 'Hematopoiesis/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/pathology', 'Macrophages/cytology', 'Megakaryocytes/*cytology', 'Mice', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription Factors/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/04/01 00:00,1993/04/01 00:01,['1993/04/01 00:00'],"['1993/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1993 Apr;21(4):525-31.,,,,,,,,,,

After excluding benign or reactive conditions, this sign should initiate a series of investigations to characterize the neoplasm and, in the case of a lymphoma, lead to prompt treatment aimed at cure. The classic description of such cervical adenopathy is that by Thomas Hodgkin, who clearly recorded both the clinical behavior and the macroscopic findings evident at dissection. Subsequent histologic study revealed the multinucleate giant cells that characterize the tumor that now bears his name and linked it to those of Greenfield, Sternberg, and Reed. Initial debate centered on whether this entity was inflammatory or malignant, with the issue further clouded by the frequent coexistence of tuberculosis. Although a number of features exist in favor of both concepts, current consensus places it among the neoplastic processes. Hodgkin's disease was separated from other malignant lymphomas as agreement on diagnostic criteria emerged. The next major step forward was the demonstration, first by Vera Peters and then by Henry Kaplan, that adequate doses of radiotherapy were curative when delivered to treatment fields that encompassed the tumor. A further milestone was the introduction by Vincent DeVita, Jr., and his colleagues of combination chemotherapy that was effective in late stage of disseminated disease. The established cornerstones of managing these patients are accurate diagnosis; precise anatomic staging, modified as appropriate by associated factors known to have prognostic value; and selection of irradiation, chemotherapy, or whatever combination will result in the best possible patient survival. However, success is not universal, and death due to resistant or relapsing disease is encountered all too frequently. It is here that the benefits of a multidisciplinary approach are evident, because a substantial level of expertise coupled with sound judgment is needed to salvage these individuals, often by means of investigational programs. Some of the latter are limited by profound myelosuppression, and safety may center on the use of cytokines in the form of interleukins and growth factors, with or without bone marrow transplantation. In such situations, benefit must be balanced against risks in well-structured clinical trials that embody informed consent. Herein lies one of the major goals for the next decade. The non-Hodgkin's lymphomas can conveniently be considered in two broad categories. Some follow an indolent clinical course, in which the lymph node retains a follicular pattern with small component cells, and others are aggressive tumors, in which primitive blasts have diffusely effaced the glandular architecture.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Jacobs, P']",['Jacobs P'],"['University of Cape Town Leukaemia Centre, Department of Haematology, Groote Schuur Hospital, South Africa.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Dis Mon,Disease-a-month : DM,0370657,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', '*Hodgkin Disease/diagnosis/epidemiology/etiology/therapy', 'Humans', '*Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/diagnosis/epidemiology/etiology/therapy', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Pregnancy', 'Prognosis']",1993/04/01 00:00,1993/04/01 00:01,['1993/04/01 00:00'],"['1993/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0011-5029(93)90006-O [pii]', '10.1016/0011-5029(93)90006-o [doi]']",ppublish,Dis Mon. 1993 Apr;39(4):213-97. doi: 10.1016/0011-5029(93)90006-o.,180,,,,,,,,,

The compound elevated low accumulation of either doxorubicin (DOX), daunorubicin (DNR), or mitoxantrone (MITO) in resistant F4-6RADR cells to the very levels observed in drug-sensitive F4-6 precursor cells. In parallel with the increase in DNR content (F4-6RADR, solvent: 303 +/- 27 pmol/mg protein; DNIG (3.3 mumol/l): 1,067 +/- 174 pmol/mg protein; F4-6P, solvent: 948 +/- 110 pmol/mg protein; n = 8-9, SEM), the amount of DNR tightly bound to the acid precipitate pellet obtained from F4-6RADR (i.e., protein, DNA, RNA) increased 3.9-times to the levels observed in sensitive F4-6 cells. The main pyridine metabolite of DNIG displayed similar activity. Concentration-response analysis revealed that DNIG and R,S-verapamil (VER) induced 100% reversal of the DNR accumulation shortage associated with the MDR phenotype but DNIG was 8 times more potent than VER (50% inhibitory concentration (IC50), 0.73 vs 5.4 mumol/l). In keeping with the accumulation assay, DNIG was about 10 times more potent than VER in sensitizing F4-6RADR cells to the cytostatic and cytotoxic effects of DNR in proliferation assays. In conclusion, DNIG is a potent in vitro modulator, improving (a) the accumulation of anthracycline-like cytostatics, (b) drug access to cellular binding sites, and (c) the cytostatic action of DNR in F4-6RADR leukemia cells of the MDR phenotype.","['Reymann, A', 'Looft, G', 'Woermann, C', 'Dietel, M', 'Erttmann, R']","['Reymann A', 'Looft G', 'Woermann C', 'Dietel M', 'Erttmann R']","['Abteilung fur Allgemeine Pharmakologie, Universitats-Krankenhaus Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Dihydropyridines)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)', 'Z81N45O25Z (niguldipine)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Daunorubicin/metabolism', 'Dihydropyridines/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Resistance', '*Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Verapamil/pharmacology']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00685872 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 1993;32(1):25-30. doi: 10.1007/BF00685872.,,,,,,,,,,

In vitro studies have indicated that interleukin 3(IL-3) and, to a lesser extent, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), but not G-CSF or M-CSF, may be capable of specifically augmenting the ability of ara-C to kill leukemic myeloid cells by pharmacological and cytokinetic mechanisms including increase of intracellular ara-CTP/dCTP pool ratios and enhanced ara-C DNA incorporation in leukemic blast cells, decrease of IC 90 of ara-C for leukemic colony-forming cells (CFC) as compared with normal CFC growth, and recruitment of quiescent leukemic cells into the cell cycle. In contrast, the combination of ara-C with M-CSF or with the leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) appears to be useful in overcoming the block in differentiation of leukemic blast, while the effects of GM-CSF and IL-3 on ara-C-induced differentiation appear limited. The combined treatment of human myeloid leukemia cells by ara-C and LIF is associated with down-regulation of c-myc gene expression, transcriptional activation of jun/fos gene expression, and features of functional differentiation (e.g., the capability to reduce nitroblue tetrazolium, to express lysozyme, or to display differentiation-related surface receptors including C3bi and the c-fms protein).

DESIGN: Case-control study. SETTING-West Berkshire and Basingstoke and North Hampshire District Health Authorities. SUBJECTS: 54 children aged 0-4 years who had leukaemia or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma diagnosed during 1972-89, who were born in the study area and were resident there when cancer was diagnosed. Six controls were selected for each case: four from hospital delivery registers and two from livebirth registers maintained by the NHS central register. Controls were matched for sex, date of birth (within six months), and area of residence at birth and time of diagnosis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Parents' employment by the nuclear industry and exposure to ionising radiation at work. RESULTS: Five (9%) of the 54 cases and 14 (4%) of the 324 controls had fathers or mothers, or both, who had been employed by the nuclear industry (relative risk 2.2, 95% confidence interval 0.6 to 6.9). Nuclear industry employees who work in areas where exposure to radiation is possible are given film badges to monitor their exposure to external penetrating ionising radiation. Three fathers of cases and two fathers of controls (and no mothers of either) had been monitored in this way before their child was conceived (relative risk 9.0, 95% confidence interval 1.0 to 107.8). No father (of a case or control) had accumulated a recorded dose of more than 5 mSv before his child was conceived, and no father had been monitored at any time in the four years before his child was conceived. A dose-response relation was not evident among fathers who had been monitored. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the children of fathers who had been monitored for exposure to external penetrating ionising radiation in the nuclear industry may be at increased risk of developing leukaemia before their fifth birthday. The finding is based on small numbers and could be due to chance. If the relationship is real the mechanisms are far from clear, except that the effect is unlikely to be due to external radiation; the possibility that it could be due to internal contamination by radioactive substances or some other exposure at work should be pursued. The above average rates of leukaemia in the study area cannot be accounted for by these findings.","['Roman, E', 'Watson, A', 'Beral, V', 'Buckle, S', 'Bull, D', 'Baker, K', 'Ryder, H', 'Barton, C']","['Roman E', 'Watson A', 'Beral V', 'Buckle S', 'Bull D', 'Baker K', 'Ryder H', 'Barton C']","['Imperial Cancer Research Fund, Cancer Epidemiology Unit, Radcliffe Infirmary, Oxford.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,BMJ,BMJ (Clinical research ed.),8900488,,IM,"['Case-Control Studies', 'Child, Preschool', 'Employment', 'England/epidemiology', '*Environmental Exposure', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Male', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology/etiology', '*Nuclear Reactors', '*Parents', 'Risk Factors']",1993/03/06 00:00,1993/03/06 00:01,['1993/03/06 00:00'],"['1993/03/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/03/06 00:01 [medline]', '1993/03/06 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/bmj.306.6878.615 [doi]'],ppublish,BMJ. 1993 Mar 6;306(6878):615-21. doi: 10.1136/bmj.306.6878.615.,,,,"['BMJ. 1993 Apr 3;306(6882):930.

Therefore, the TUV Rheinland instructed by the Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Protection, and Reactor Safety maintains an ""Information System on Cancer Mortality and District Characteristics (IKK)"" using official cause of death and resident population statistics. Mortality data for a variety of different cancer sites are documented with local and temporal separation for the area of the Federal Republic of Germany (before the German unification) and for a period of 20 years. The IKK data can be employed as a meaningful tool for epidemiological investigations relating to the correlation of cancer mortality and environmental agents.

Median follow-up is 36 months. No apparent long-term deleterious effects on BM function were observed. Moreover, disease-free survival and overall survival were similar for patients on both treatment arms, arguing for the long-term safety of recombinant human granulocyte macrophage-colony-stimulating factor (rhGM-CSF). The only factors predictive for both a high risk of relapse over time and mortality were having the diagnosis of ALL and/or undergoing ABMT in resistant relapse. We attempted to identify clinical variables before BM harvest, at the time of marrow infusion, or events within the first 100 days posttransplant, which might predict speed of neutrophil recovery in the setting of placebo or rhGM-CSF administration after ABMT. Only previous exposure to agents that deplete stem cells led to a significant delay in neutrophil recovery, suggesting their avoidance in patients who may undergo ABMT. Nevertheless, even those patients benefited from rhGM-CSF. For all patients, rhGM-CSF and agents that deplete stem cells were the strongest independent predictors for neutrophil engraftment. With the increasing use of newer hematopoietic growth factors both alone and in combination, long-term follow-up is essential to confirm the same safety that we report with rhGM-CSF.","['Rabinowe, S N', 'Neuberg, D', 'Bierman, P J', 'Vose, J M', 'Nemunaitis, J', 'Singer, J W', 'Freedman, A S', 'Mauch, P', 'Demetri, G', 'Onetto, N']","['Rabinowe SN', 'Neuberg D', 'Bierman PJ', 'Vose JM', 'Nemunaitis J', 'Singer JW', 'Freedman AS', 'Mauch P', 'Demetri G', 'Onetto N', 'et al.']","['Division of Tumor Immunology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02115.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase III', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Hodgkin Disease/blood/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/blood/*therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*therapy', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Recombinant Proteins/therapeutic use', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",1993/04/01 00:00,1993/04/01 00:01,['1993/04/01 00:00'],"['1993/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)79203-7 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1993 Apr 1;81(7):1903-8.,,,,,,,,"['CA 34183/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 47748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,

COS-7 cell transfectants expressing the wild-type EpoR showed two major cross-linked species of 145 and 110 Kd, both of which were recognized by the antibody against the cloned EpoR after denaturation under reducing conditions. Furthermore, a reduction in sizes of both cross-linked bands was observed in COS-7 transfectants expressing a mutant receptor with an internal deletion, thus indicating that both species contain the cloned EpoR. COS-7 cells expressing mutant receptors with carboxy-terminal deletions showed cross-linked bands corresponding to the smaller species of the two observed in cells expressing the wild-type receptor. In contrast to COS-7 cell transfectants, DA3 cells expressing wild-type or mutant EpoR cDNAs showed an additional cross-like species of 130 Kd. The size of this species was not altered by deletions in EpoR, showing that it did not contain EpoR. The 130-Kd cross-linked band, which would contain a 95-Kd protein, was also observed in a murine erythroleukemia cell line, D1B. These results suggest that Epo associates with a second component of 95 Kd, which is specifically expressed in hematopoietic cells.","['Miura, O', 'Ihle, J N']","['Miura O', 'Ihle JN']","[""Department of Biochemistry, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Receptors, Erythropoietin)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Erythropoietin/*chemistry/genetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/metabolism', 'Mice', '*Mutation', 'Phosphorylation', 'Receptors, Erythropoietin/*chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/04/01 00:00,1993/04/01 00:01,['1993/04/01 00:00'],"['1993/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)79181-0 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1993 Apr 1;81(7):1739-44.,,,,,,,,"['DK42932/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,

Patients received antifungal prophylaxis with oral mycostatin (1,000,000 U four times daily) or clotrimazole (1 troche five times daily). Analysis was performed on an intent-to-treat basis. There was no significant difference between groups in race, age, or type and stage of leukemia, but there were more males in the placebo group (P = 0.073 [Fisher's exact test]). Fewer enoxacin patients had gram-negative bacteremia (1 versus 14 [P < 0.001]), gram-negative infection at any site (2 versus 19 [P < 0.001]), or bacterial and/or fungal infection (17 versus 26 [P = 0.056]).

Logistic regression confirmed (odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals are given in parentheses) that enoxacin reduced the risk of gram-negative infection (0.07; 0.01 to 0.30), especially gram-negative bacillary bacteremia (0.05; 0.01 to 0.37), without altering the risk of gram-positive bacterial (0.63; 0.26 to 1.5), deep fungal (2.57; 0.47 to 13.9), or Clostridium difficile (1.16; 0.3 to 4.56) infection. The median time to the onset of fever of more than or equal 102.8 F (39.3 degree C) was 32 days for the enoxacin group versus 15 days for patients receiving placebo (P=0.0007 [Wilcoxon test]).

In this study, linear growth and growth hormone (GH) secretion were evaluated in 25 children (14 males and 11 females) with various neoplastic or non-neoplastic hematological disorders who had survived for more than 3 years after BMT. Impaired linear growth after BMT, as defined by a change in height standard deviation score (SDS) by more than -1.0 SD, was observed in 14 patients (56%). Four children showed severe growth suppression with a decrease in SD score by more than 2.0, and 10 exhibited a moderate reduction by between 1.0 and 2.0 SD. A recovery of normal height velocity was observed in those who had received BMT at a younger age. The type of disease, a difference in preconditioning regimen, the presence of chronic graft-versus-host disease or a GH secretory capacity 1 year after BMT were not contributing factors for impaired growth. A serial examination of GH secretion with insulin-induced hypoglycemia demonstrated that poor GH secretion was not necessarily a prerequisite for impaired growth. These results indicate that the secretory status of GH does not predict the future growth pattern of children who received BMT.","['Shinohara, O', 'Kubota, C', 'Hinohara, T', 'Hattori, K', 'Yabe, H', 'Yabe, M', 'Kato, S']","['Shinohara O', 'Kubota C', 'Hinohara T', 'Hattori K', 'Yabe H', 'Yabe M', 'Kato S']","['Department of Pediatrics, Tokai University School of Medicine, Kanagawa, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Australia,Acta Paediatr Jpn,Acta paediatrica Japonica : Overseas edition,0370357,['9002-72-6 (Growth Hormone)'],IM,"['Adolescent', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Growth', 'Growth Hormone/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/physiopathology/surgery', 'Male']",1993/02/01 00:00,1993/02/01 00:01,['1993/02/01 00:00'],"['1993/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1442-200x.1993.tb02999.x [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Paediatr Jpn. 1993 Feb;35(1):22-6. doi: 10.1111/j.1442-200x.1993.tb02999.x.,,,,,,,,,,

Silencing has been shown to depend on an element normally located in the proviral 5' noncoding region and occurs at the DNA level in the absence of retroviral proteins. Using fragments of the RBS region, we now show that the minimal size of the silencer corresponds to M-MuLV nt 147-163 and overlaps with the retroviral primer binding site region by 17 of its 18 bp. A panel of point mutations within the RBS has been examined to yield a consensus RBS sequence which is consistent with the notion that a previously identified nuclear factor (binding factor A) mediates RBS repression. Viral vectors using neomycin, beta-galactosidase, and luciferase reporters have been employed to show that RBS-mediated repression occurs in EC and embryonal stem, but not in other tested cell types. Repression was observed to occur within 48 hr of infection, prior to when global methylation of proviruses has been reported to occur. Repression also occurred after azacytidine treatment of EC cells, supporting the notion that the RBS functions independently of provirus methylation. However, levels of provirus methylation in selected cells were increased in the presence of a wild-type RBS, and methylation correlated with a secondary stage of virus repression. Thus, the M-MuLV RBS acts directly to control expression in EC cells and also appears to trigger a secondary level of repression which is coincident with provirus methylation.","['Kempler, G', 'Freitag, B', 'Berwin, B', 'Nanassy, O', 'Barklis, E']","['Kempler G', 'Freitag B', 'Berwin B', 'Nanassy O', 'Barklis E']","['Vollum Institute for Advanced Biomedical Research, Oregon Health Sciences University, Portland 97201.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)', 'EC 3.2.1.23 (beta-Galactosidase)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'DNA, Viral/genetics', 'Luciferases/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'PC12 Cells', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proviruses/genetics', '*Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Repressor Proteins/*metabolism', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Stem Cells', 'Teratoma', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'beta-Galactosidase/genetics/metabolism']",1993/04/01 00:00,1993/04/01 00:01,['1993/04/01 00:00'],"['1993/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0042-6822(83)71177-3 [pii]', '10.1006/viro.1993.1177 [doi]']",ppublish,Virology. 1993 Apr;193(2):690-9. doi: 10.1006/viro.1993.1177.,,,,,,,,['1R01 CA53332-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,

Most cultures became negative soon after the administration of prophylactic antibiotics and there were only few persistent colonizations. 14 potential pathogens resistant to the intestinal decontamination regimen were isolated in surveillance cultures, none of which caused infection. Of the 212 febrile episodes, only 22 were caused by a microbiologically documented infection with potential pathogens. Most microbiologically documented infections were caused by organisms not routinely identified by surveillance cultures, indicating efficient selective intestinal decontamination. Only 9 (41%) of the 22 infections with potential pathogens were predicted by surveillance cultures. We conclude that surveillance cultures are of limited use in predicting infection or identifying causative organisms of fever in neutropenic patients receiving selective intestinal decontamination.

The hyperleukocytic syndrome most commonly occurs in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia. It commonly affects the lungs and may cause intracranial hemorrhage. Long-term control is accomplished only by inducing a remission of the leukemia. Patients with DIC may have excessive clotting, uncontrolled bleeding, or both. Infections are the most common cause; cases in obstetric patients are usually due to abruptio placentae or retained dead fetus. Any acute leukemia can cause DIC.

Thirteen of 19 new compounds had greater growth inhibitory potency than amonafide in a panel of cultured murine and human tumor cells using the sulforhodamine B and MTT dye assays. The most active agents were similarly more toxic than amonafide to normal neonatal rat myocytes in vitro, but they had better chemotherapeutic indexes.

So far two main types of tal-1 deletions have been described. Upon analysis of 134 T-ALL we have found two new types of tal-1 deletions. These four types of deletions juxtapose the 5' part of the tal-1 gene to the sil gene promoter, thereby deleting all coding sil exons but leaving the coding tal-1 exons undamaged. The recombination signal sequences (RSS) and fusion regions of the tal-1 deletion breakpoints strongly resemble the RSS and junctional regions of immunoglobulin/T cell receptor (TCR) gene rearrangements, which implies that they are probably caused by the same V(D)J recombinase complex. Analysis of the 134 T-ALL suggested that the occurrence of tal-1 deletions is associated with the CD3 phenotype, because no tal-1 deletions were found in 25 TCR-gamma/delta + T-ALL, whereas 8 of the 69 CD3- T-ALL and 11 of the 40 TCR-alpha/beta + T-ALL contained such a deletion. Careful examination of all TCR genes revealed that tal-1 deletions exclusively occurred in CD3- or CD3+ T-ALL of the alpha/beta lineage with a frequency of 18% in T-ALL with one deleted TCR-delta allele, and a frequency of 34% in T-ALL with TCR-delta gene deletions on both alleles. Therefore, we conclude that alpha/beta lineage commitment of the T-ALL and especially the extent of TCR-delta gene deletions determines the chance of a tal-1 deletion. This suggests that tal-1 deletions are mediated via the same deletion mechanism as TCR-delta gene deletions.","['Breit, T M', 'Mol, E J', 'Wolvers-Tettero, I L', 'Ludwig, W D', 'van Wering, E R', 'van Dongen, J J']","['Breit TM', 'Mol EJ', 'Wolvers-Tettero IL', 'Ludwig WD', 'van Wering ER', 'van Dongen JJ']","['Department of Immunology, University Hospital Dijkzigt/Erasmus University, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (STIL protein, human)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '135471-20-4 (TAL1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors', 'Blotting, Southern', 'CD3 Complex/genetics', 'DNA, Neoplasm', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', '*Gene Deletion', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Oncogene Proteins, Fusion', 'Phenotype', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Proteins/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*genetics', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'Restriction Mapping', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', '*Transcription Factors']",1993/04/01 00:00,1993/04/01 00:01,['1993/04/01 00:00'],"['1993/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.177.4.965 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1993 Apr 1;177(4):965-77. doi: 10.1084/jem.177.4.965.,,,"['sil', 'tal-1']",,PMC2190963,,,,,

The entire coding sequence for IL-7 as well as an alternatively spliced IL-7 mRNA are transcribed in these leukemic cells. No IL-7 mRNA expression is detected in fresh peripheral blood mononuclear cells from normal individuals. Furthermore, the ""normal"" nonleukemic subsets of cells isolated from the same CLL patients also do not express IL-7 mRNA. The only subset of cells in which IL-7 mRNA is detected is the one that contains the leukemic cells themselves. The polymerase chain reaction was used to examine cytokine expression, and flow cytometry was used to purify the various subsets of peripheral blood mononuclear cells examined in these studies, as well as to examine IL-7 receptor expression. A proportion of the cells from the CLL patients express receptors that are capable of binding IL-7, whereas T cell-depleted normal cell preparations do not express receptors for IL-7 that are detectable with IL-7 fluorokines. The IL-7 receptor-bearing cells in CLL patients include a portion of leukemic cells and a fraction of the T cells, as well as some non-T, non-B cells. These findings suggest that IL-7 and IL-7 receptor expression in CLL may be relevant not only to growth regulation of the leukemic cells but to the immunological abnormalities that occur in the disease as well, possibly via the induction of inappropriate immune activity of IL-7 receptor-bearing cells.","['Frishman, J', 'Long, B', 'Knospe, W', 'Gregory, S', 'Plate, J']","['Frishman J', 'Long B', 'Knospe W', 'Gregory S', 'Plate J']","[""Department of Medicine, Rush Presbyterian St. Luke's Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois 60612.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (DNA, Single-Stranded)', '0 (Interleukin-7)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-7)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'B-Lymphocyte Subsets/metabolism', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Clone Cells', 'DNA, Single-Stranded', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-7/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*metabolism', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Receptors, Immunologic/biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Interleukin-7', '*Transcription, Genetic']",1993/04/01 00:00,1993/04/01 00:01,['1993/04/01 00:00'],"['1993/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.177.4.955 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1993 Apr 1;177(4):955-64. doi: 10.1084/jem.177.4.955.,,,,,PMC2190977,,,['GM-39595/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,

Recently, however, human allospecific NK cell clones have been generated that recognize at least five distinct specificities inherited recessively and controlled by genes linked to the MHC. Because the genetic specificity of these alloreactive NK cells in vitro appears analogous to that of in vivo NK cell-mediated murine hybrid resistance, i.e., the rejection of parental bone marrow in irradiated F1 animals, we tested the ability of human alloreactive NK clones to recognize allogeneic hematopoietic progenitor cells. NK cells from two specificity 1 alloreactive NK clones, ES9 and ES10, significantly and often completely suppressed colony formation by purified peripheral blood hematopoietic progenitor cells from specificity 1-susceptible donors, but had no significant effect on the cells of specificity 1-resistant donors. Activated polyclonal NK cells were less efficient than the NK clones in inhibiting colony formation and had a similar effect on cells from both specificity 1-susceptible and -resistant donors. The alloreactive NK clones produced cytokines with a suppressive effect on in vitro hematopoiesis, such as interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), when exposed to phytohemagglutinin blasts from specificity 1-susceptible, but not -resistant donors. However, the mechanism by which alloreactive NK cells inhibit colony formation is more consistent with a direct cytotoxic effect than with the production of inhibitory cytokines because antibodies (anti-IFN-gamma, alpha-TNF-alpha, and -lymphotoxin) that completely blocked the inhibition by polyclonal NK cells had only a minimal effect on the inhibition by the alloreactive clones. Moreover, the alloreactive clones were directly cytolytic in a 51Cr release assay against enriched preparations of peripheral blood progenitor cells from specificity 1-susceptible donors. These data indicate that the alloreactive NK cells are likely the human counterpart of the cells mediating murine hybrid resistance and that these cells might play clinically important roles in rejection or in graft-versus-leukemia reactions after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation.","['Bellone, G', 'Valiante, N M', 'Viale, O', 'Ciccone, E', 'Moretta, L', 'Trinchieri, G']","['Bellone G', 'Valiante NM', 'Viale O', 'Ciccone E', 'Moretta L', 'Trinchieri G']","['Wistar Institute of Anatomy and Biology, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Clone Cells', 'Hematopoiesis/*physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Interferon-gamma/physiology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/cytology/immunology/metabolism/*physiology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/physiology']",1993/04/01 00:00,1993/04/01 00:01,['1993/04/01 00:00'],"['1993/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.177.4.1117 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1993 Apr 1;177(4):1117-25. doi: 10.1084/jem.177.4.1117.,,,,,PMC2190979,,,"['CA-10815/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-20833/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-32898/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,

Fourier transformation demonstrated that group 1 children had a faster periodicity of GH secretion before TBI than group 2 children (160 vs 200 min) but the amplitude of their GH peaks was similar. There were no differences between the groups in circadian cortisol rhythm, serum concentrations of insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), sex steroids and basal thyroxine (T4). The peak serum GH concentrations observed after insulin-induced hypoglycaemia were similar between the two groups but the majority of patients had blunted responses.

There were no significant changes in the peak serum GH concentration response to insulin-induced hypoglycaemia which remained blunted. Serum IGF-I, sex steroid, cortisol or T4 concentrations were unchanged. Low-dose cranial irradiation has an effect on GH secretion affecting predominantly frequency modulation leading to fast frequency, normal amplitude GH pulsatility. This change is accentuated by TBI.

This study was undertaken to characterize an unusual variant of HLA-A30, designated HLA-A30JS, identified in a patient with leukemia who was a candidate for unrelated donor marrow transplantation. IEF and cDNA-sequencing analyses revealed that A30JS is a novel variant differing from the IEF-defined subtype A30.1 (encoded by the A*3002 allele) by a single amino acid substitution. An unrelated marrow donor was identified who was matched with the patient for HLA-A3, B7, B18, DR2, and DR3, but mismatched within the A30 antigen family for the two distinct alleles A*3002 versus A30JS. These two alleles encode a single amino acid substitution, Arg versus Gly, at position 56 in the alpha 1 domain. Position 56 is located outside the antigen-binding cleft of the class I molecule, suggesting that this substitution may not be functionally significant. Transplantation from this donor was performed and the patient is surviving free of leukemia for more than 700 days after transplant. The maximum acute GVHD observed was scored as grade II, but immunosuppressive therapy is still required for control of chronic GVHD. This study demonstrates how the molecular characterization of a novel HLA-A allele in a patient could facilitate the selection of an unrelated donor.

Clonogenic survival assays indicated that t-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BuOOH) is much more toxic to Se(-) cells (LC50 approximately 10 microM) than to Se(+) or selenium-repleted [Se(-/+)] cells (LC50 approximately 250 microM). Hypersensitivity of Se(-) cells to t-BuOOH was partially reversed by treating them with Ebselen, a selenoperoxidase mimetic; thus, selenoperoxidase insufficiency was probably the most serious defect of Se deprivation. Cytotoxicity of t-BuOOH was inhibited by desferrioxamine and by alpha-tocopherol, indicating that redox iron and free radical intermediates are involved. Elevated sensitivity of Se(-) cells to t-BuOOH was accompanied by an increased susceptibility to free radical lipid peroxidation, which became even more pronounced in cells that had been grown in arachidonate (20:4, n-6) supplemented media. That glutathione (GSH) is required for cytoprotection was established by showing that Se(+) cells are less resistant to t-BuOOH after exposure to buthionine sulfoximine (BSO), an inhibitor of GSH synthesis, or 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU), an inhibitor of glutathione reductase. Coupled enzymatic assays indicated that Se(+) or Se(-/+) cells metabolize t-BuOOH 20-25 times more rapidly than Se(-), consistent with the measured difference in GPX activities of these cells. Correspondingly, when challenged with t-BuOOH, Se(+) cells showed an initial loss of GSH and elevation of GSSG that exceeded that of Se(-) cells. It was further shown that like Se(-) cells, BSO- or BCNU-treated Se(+) cells metabolize t-BuOOH more slowly than nontreated controls. These results clearly indicate that selenoperoxidase action in the glutathione cycle is a vital element in cellular defense against toxic hydroperoxides.","['Geiger, P G', 'Lin, F', 'Girotti, A W']","['Geiger PG', 'Lin F', 'Girotti AW']","['Department of Biochemistry, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee 53226.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Free Radic Biol Med,Free radical biology & medicine,8709159,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Azoles)', '0 (Free Radicals)', '0 (Isoindoles)', '0 (Organoselenium Compounds)', '0 (Peroxides)', '40X2P7DPGH (ebselen)', '955VYL842B (tert-Butylhydroperoxide)', 'EC 1.11.1.9 (Glutathione Peroxidase)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'H6241UJ22B (Selenium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antioxidants/pharmacology', 'Azoles/pharmacology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Free Radicals/metabolism', 'Glutathione/deficiency/metabolism', 'Glutathione Peroxidase/*metabolism', 'Isoindoles', 'Leukemia L1210/metabolism', 'Lipid Peroxidation/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Organoselenium Compounds/pharmacology', 'Peroxides/*antagonists & inhibitors/toxicity', 'Selenium/deficiency/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism', 'tert-Butylhydroperoxide']",1993/03/01 00:00,1993/03/01 00:01,['1993/03/01 00:00'],"['1993/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0891-5849(93)90022-M [pii]', '10.1016/0891-5849(93)90022-m [doi]']",ppublish,Free Radic Biol Med. 1993 Mar;14(3):251-66. doi: 10.1016/0891-5849(93)90022-m.,,,,,,,,,,

Today, at least two-thirds of newly diagnosed cases are curable with intensified risk-based therapy. The challenge now is to identify, prior to or early in treatment, the one-third of patients who are destined to relapse, so that alternative therapy can be introduced sooner. Cytogenetic studies of lymphoblasts have identified recurring abnormalities of prognostic importance and pinpointed chromosomal regions for molecular analyses. Recently, molecular diagnostic techniques have been developed for the more common cytogenetic subgroups of ALL, defined by the t(1;19) and t(9;22) chromosomal translocations (approximately 10% of cases). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques can identify these clinically important subgroups in the absence of successful cytogenetic studies. PCR analysis also provides a sensitive and specific tool for the detection of minimal residual disease during apparent (clinically defined) remission. Additionally, molecular studies of cases with specific cytogenetic lesions have helped to clarify the events leading to leukemic transformation of normal lymphoid cells.

Chemotherapy postponement due to insufficient bone marrow recovery was less frequent when IL-3 was administered. There are some clinical studies available in which rhIL-3 is combined with rh granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). The results do not clearly suggest superiority of these combinations over rhGM-CSF alone, but this may be partly due to the time scheduling of the growth factors.

The role of rhIL-3 after high-dose chemotherapy and autologous bone marrow reinfusion is still questionable. The addition of rhIL-3 to rhGM-CSF both administered after chemotherapy may allow a very high yield of peripheral stem cells suitable for bone marrow reconstitution after high-dose chemotherapy. rhIL-3 can stimulate leukemia tumor cell proliferation in vitro as well as proliferation of solid tumor cell lines.

In myeloid tumors, dissection of the translocation in Philadelphia chromosome positive leukemias has demonstrated involvement of the abl oncogene; other genes, both known and previously unknown, are beginning to be identified in translocations that characterize other classes of myeloid leukemia. These kinds of studies are being extended to search for tumor suppressor genes in association with chromosomal deletions, and some of the new molecular data are already being usefully applied in clinical diagnosis and management. Ultimately, there may also be specific therapies developed from these recent findings, but the recognition of how many different genes are involved has also indicated that no single, simple answer will be forthcoming.","['Nowell, P C']",['Nowell PC'],"['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia 19104-6082.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Stem Cells,"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",9304532,,IM,"['Chromosome Aberrations', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/genetics', 'Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/genetics', 'Oncogenes', 'Translocation, Genetic']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/stem.5530110104 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells. 1993 Jan;11(1):9-19. doi: 10.1002/stem.5530110104.,47,,"['abl', 'bcl2', 'bcr', 'c-myc']",,,,,,,

Hepsulfam was developed as an analog of busulfan, an alkylating agent that is used to treat patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia and for marrow ablation prior to bone marrow transplantation. The objective of this study was to identify the spectrum of human tumor cells that were sensitive to hepsulfam. The following three cytotoxicity assays were employed to evaluate the in vitro cytotoxic potential of hepsulfam: 1) primary human tumors were exposed to three levels of hepsulfam for a one hour or continuous exposure, and growth in soft agar was determined; 2) human non-tumor cells and tumor cell lines were compared in an assay that measured the conversion of 14C-glucose to 14CO2 as an index of viability; and 3) the toxicity of hepsulfam to hematopoietic progenitor cells was determined in a progenitor cell colony forming assay. Cytotoxicity was not observed for human tumor cells following one hour hepsulfam exposures; in contrast, marked dose-dependent cytotoxicity was observed with continuous exposures. In human tumor cell lines, the cytotoxicity of hepsulfam was compared directly with busulfan at equimolar concentrations. Hepsulfam was more cytotoxic than busulfan in all cell lines tested. Cytotoxic activity was seen in lung, melanoma, kidney, breast, colon, ovary and brain tumor cells. These results, along with the information obtained from Phase I trials, will facilitate selection of patients who could receive this agent in Phase II efficacy trials.","['Marshall, M V', 'Marshall, M H', 'Degen, D R', 'Roodman, G D', 'Kuhn, J G', 'Ross, M E', 'Von Hoff, D D']","['Marshall MV', 'Marshall MH', 'Degen DR', 'Roodman GD', 'Kuhn JG', 'Ross ME', 'Von Hoff DD']","['University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Stem Cells,"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",9304532,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Sulfonic Acids)', '971DU2GQ51 (hepsulfam)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Busulfan/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Male', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Sulfonic Acids/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*drug effects', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/stem.5530110111 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells. 1993 Jan;11(1):62-9. doi: 10.1002/stem.5530110111.,,,,,,,,['N01-CM57737/CM/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,

Compared with doxorubicin, hydroxyrubicin showed similar or superior in vitro cytotoxicity against P388, L1210, and M5076 cells, as determined by an MTT assay, and against 8226 and CEM cells, as determined by a growth inhibition assay. Hydroxyrubicin was 5 and 13 times more effective than doxorubicin in inhibiting the growth of multidrug-resistant CEM (CEMvbl) and 8226 (8226R) cells, respectively. Hydroxyrubicin was not cross-resistant with doxorubicin in a cytotoxicity assay against KB 3-1 and KB V1 cells (resistance index 1.1 for hydroxyrubicin versus > 15.6 for doxorubicin). Cellular uptake and retention of hydroxyrubicin were studied by flow cytometry in parent and multidrug-resistant 8226 cells, and compared with those of doxorubicin. In 8226 sensitive cells, 2 h uptake and retention of doxorubicin were similar or higher than those of hydroxyrubicin. In 8226R cells, uptake and retention of hydroxyrubicin were about 3-fold higher than those of doxorubicin. In mice, the acute LD50 of hydroxyrubicin was about 3-fold higher than that of doxorubicin (79.1 versus 25.7 mg/kg). At equitoxic doses, hydroxyrubicin was as myelosuppressive as doxorubicin but less cardiotoxic, as assessed by the Bertazzoli test. In contrast to doxorubicin, hydroxyrubicin, due to the lack of basic amine function, showed no selective interaction with negatively-charged cardiolipin (CL). The observed decrease of affinity to CL might be responsible for the reduced cardiotoxicity of hydroxyrubicin. In in vivo antitumor activity studies, hydroxyrubicin at the optimal dose (37.5 mg/kg, i.p., on day 1) had significant activity against intraperitoneal P388 leukemia resistant to doxorubicin, whereas doxorubicin (10 mg/kg, i.p., on day 1) was inactive (%T/C 163-200 versus 118-120). These studies indicate that: (i) the amino group at position 3' is not essential for doxorubicin to exert its biological activity, (ii) removal of the basic center (deamination at the C-3') results in an increased cellular uptake and retention, (iii) the increased cellular uptake and retention of hydroxyrubicin in multidrug-resistant cells correlate with a partial or total lack of cross-resistance of this analog with the parent compound, doxorubicin, and (iv) deamination at position 3' confers a reduced cardiotoxicity and diminished affinity for CL.","['Priebe, W', 'Van, N T', 'Burke, T G', 'Perez-Soler, R']","['Priebe W', 'Van NT', 'Burke TG', 'Perez-Soler R']","['Department of Medical Oncology, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Anticancer Drugs,Anti-cancer drugs,9100823,"['0 (Cardiolipins)', '3Z8479ZZ5X (Epirubicin)', ""73113-90-3 (3'-deamino-3'-hydroxydoxorubicin)"", '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cardiolipins/chemistry', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Doxorubicin/analogs & derivatives/*chemistry/toxicity', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Resistance', '*Epirubicin/*analogs & derivatives', 'Heart/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'KB Cells/drug effects', 'Lethal Dose 50', 'Leukemia P388/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred ICR', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism']",1993/02/01 00:00,1993/02/01 00:01,['1993/02/01 00:00'],"['1993/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00001813-199302000-00005 [doi]'],ppublish,Anticancer Drugs. 1993 Feb;4(1):37-48. doi: 10.1097/00001813-199302000-00005.,,,,,,,,"['16672/PHS HHS/United States', 'CA-50270/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,

Many recent developments in experimental bone marrow transplantation resulted from not only the discovery of new spontaneously occurring models of human diseases but also the induction of neoplastic diseases, eg, chronic myelogenous leukemia, by transplantation of syngeneic marrow cells into which foreign genes were introduced and expressed. Murine bone marrow transplantation systems are an exemplary format for the study of clinically relevant basic aspects of hematopoiesis, including identification and elucidation of the biology of hematopoietic stem cells.

Marrow transplant from an HLA-matched sibling donor can cure some patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia. Best results are observed when patients receive transplants early in chronic phase. The advantages of delaying marrow transplantation for a trial of interferon-alpha are questionable if a suitable matched related donor is available. The high incidence of relapse following T-lymphocyte-depleted marrow transplantation for chronic myelogenous leukemia emphasizes the existence of dormant, malignant clones that persist after ablative therapy. The presence of very small numbers of bcr-abl-positive hematopoietic cells after marrow transplantation can be detected by sensitive molecular genetic techniques and does not always predict hematologic relapse. Successful treatment of hematologic relapse after marrow transplantation can result from treatment with interferon-alpha, donor buffy coat cells, or second transplantation. HLA phenotypically matched and, in some cases, class I HLA antigen mismatched unrelated donors can be used successfully for marrow transplantation. Complications include an increased incidence of graft failure and graft-versus-host disease. Younger patients undergoing transplantation early in the disease course fare best. Preliminary results suggest that autologous marrow transplantation can induce complete hematologic and cytogenetic remission and may prolong survival in some cases.

Leukaemic disease was found in 105 cases. The following markers were used for immunocytology (APAAP technique) of blood and/or BM smears: CD19, CD5, CD10, CD11c, CD14, CD21, CD22, CD23, CD25, CD38 and TdT. All cases tested showed CD19, but no TdT expression. Every case of HCL had a distinct phenotype with expression of CD11c, CD22 and CD25 and the lack of CD5 and CD23 antigens. In all other NHL cases a very heterogenous expression of CD-antigens with no significant correlations to the cytomorphological subtypes was found. The expression of CD5 is a frequent but inconstant finding in lymphoproliferative diseases other than B-CLL, so 50% of CB/CC, 75% of CC and 80% of IC were CD5 positive. Our results indicate that, with the exception of HCL, the diagnostic relevance of immunophenotyping for the classification of cytomorphologically and histopathologically defined subtypes in blood and/or BM is of very limited value.","['Schwonzen, M', 'Pohl, C', 'Steinmetz, T', 'Seckler, W', 'Vetten, B', 'Thiele, J', 'Wickramanayake, D', 'Diehl, V']","['Schwonzen M', 'Pohl C', 'Steinmetz T', 'Seckler W', 'Vetten B', 'Thiele J', 'Wickramanayake D', 'Diehl V']","['Klinik I fur Innere Medizin, Koln, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antigens, CD)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Bone Marrow/*immunology/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*classification/immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",1993/02/01 00:00,1993/02/01 00:01,['1993/02/01 00:00'],"['1993/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1993.tb08277.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1993 Feb;83(2):232-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1993.tb08277.x.,,,,['Br J Haematol. 1993 Sep;85(1):236-8.

Since the proto-oncogene c-fms is a feature of cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage, we examined HCs for c-fms expression. We found that approximately 80% of peripheral blood HCs expressed the c-fms protein (8/8 cases). Expression of the 150 kD protein by HCs was shown using three different techniques, APAAP, immunofluorescence and immunoprecipitation, using two different antibodies. Other mature B cell lymphoproliferative disorders examined (PLL, CLL and multiple myeloma) did not express c-fms. We also examined the c-fms expression of normal B-cells: both the in vivo activated (low density) fraction of tonsil B cells and tonsil B cells activated in vitro with SAC plus IL-2 expressed the c-fms protein. As in the case of monocytes c-fms expression by HCs was shown to be down regulated by its ligand M-CSF, and by TNF alpha, both caused a decrease in the receptor expression from 80% to 30% and in the intensity of staining from 6 to 3 x 10(4) molecules/cell. However, as for monocytes, GM-CSF treatment of HCs had no effect on the expression of c-fms; alpha IFN also had no effect. M-CSF treatment of HCs also induced phosphorylation of c-fms, and a number of other proteins, on tyrosine. However, M-CSF was unable to induce HC proliferation either alone or in combination with IL-2, IL-4 or IL-6; in addition it had no effect on HC proliferation induced by SAC, anti-mu or TNF alpha. In addition, M-CSF either alone, or in combination with the above cytokines, had no effect on the differentiated state of HCs as shown by both immunoglobulin secretion and surface antigen expression. M-CSF also had no effect on the morphology or long-term survival of HCs in culture. This study therefore demonstrates that both HCs and activated B-cells express c-fms, and that M-CSF binds to and activates its receptor on HCs. Although c-fms and several other proteins were shown to be phosphorylated in response to M-CSF, the functional consequences of this phosphorylation remain unclear.","['Till, K J', 'Lopez, A', 'Slupsky, J', 'Cawley, J C']","['Till KJ', 'Lopez A', 'Slupsky J', 'Cawley JC']","['Department of Haematology, University of Liverpool.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '81627-83-0 (Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Down-Regulation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*metabolism', 'Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Mitosis/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Receptor, Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*biosynthesis', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology']",1993/02/01 00:00,1993/02/01 00:01,['1993/02/01 00:00'],"['1993/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1993.tb08276.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1993 Feb;83(2):223-31. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1993.tb08276.x.,,,,['Br J Haematol. 1993 Aug;84(4):755-6.

This clone consisted of a 4.3-kb viral sequence containing the 5' long terminal repeat (LTR), gag, and N-terminal portion of the pol gene, with an overall 1.3% sequence variation resulting from mostly nucleotide substitutions, as compared to the prototype HTLV-I ATK-1. The gag and pol regions showed only 1.4% and 1.2% nucleotide variations, respectively. However, the U3 region of the LTR showed the highest sequence variation (3.6%), where several changes appear to be common among certain TSP/HAM isolates.

Phosphatidylcholine hydrolysis by phospholipase D plays a major role in the second sustained 1,2-diacylglycerol accumulation].",64-73,"Activation of RBL-2H3 cells by cross-linking their IgE receptors resulted in a biphasic increase in cellular 1,2-diacylglycerol (DG) content. The first-phase DG production was coincident with a transient breakdown of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2). The second large sustained phase of DG accumulation appeared to be derived mainly from phosphatidylcholine (PC) and partly from phosphatidylinositol (PI). The accumulation of phosphatidylethanol (PEt) and the reduction of DG formation in the presence of ethanol suggested that more than 50% of the DG due to PC hydrolysis was formed through the action of phospholipase D. The addition of phorbol myristate acetate or Ca2+ ionophore A23187 stimulated the hydrolysis of PC. In protein kinase C (PKC) down-regulated cells, PC hydrolysis induced by A23187 was markedly suppressed. Taken together, these results lead as to speculate that hydrolysis of PC is regulated by the increase in cellular Ca2+ and PKC activation through the hydrolysis of PIP2. The exocytotic response became evident with a 1 min time lag after antigen (Ag) stimulation, followed by the transient breakdown of PIP2. Ethanol inhibited Ag-stimulated serotonin secretion. The concentration-dependent inhibitory profile of secretion by ethanol correlated well with that of the sustained phase of DG accumulation. These results suggest that sustained DG production, mainly derived from PC through phospholipase D action, plays an important role in maintaining secretory response.","['Fujimiya, H', 'Miyata, H', 'Nakashima, S', 'Nozawa, Y']","['Fujimiya H', 'Miyata H', 'Nakashima S', 'Nozawa Y']","['Department of Otolaryngology, Gifu University School of Medicine.']",['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Arerugi,Arerugi = [Allergy],0241212,"['0 (1,2-diacylglycerol)', '0 (Antigens)', '0 (Diglycerides)', '0 (Phosphatidylcholines)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', 'EC 3.1.4.4 (Phospholipase D)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens/*immunology', 'Diglycerides/*biosynthesis', 'Hydrolysis', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/immunology/*metabolism', 'Phosphatidylcholines/*metabolism', 'Phospholipase D/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Receptors, IgE/immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Arerugi. 1993 Jan;42(1):64-73.,,,,,,,,,,

C2-ceramide (0.6 to 5 microM), a synthetic cell-permeable ceramide analog, induced internucleosomal DNA fragmentation, which was inhibited by zinc ion. Other amphiphilic lipids failed to induce apoptosis. The closely related C2-dihydroceramide was also ineffective, which suggests a critical role for the sphingolipid double bond.

In this study, we compared the effects of heme, several metalloporphyrins, protoporphyrin IX, and iron on the signal or IFN-gamma-mediated pathways, such as the expression of major histocompatibility complex class II antigens, neopterin formation, and the degradation of tryptophan. Using the human monocytic cell line, THP-1, we found that heme, Zn-mesoporphyrin, Zn-deuteroporphyrin, Co-protoporphyrin, and iron reduced the efficiency of the IFN-gamma signal. In addition, Zn-mesoporphyrin almost fully inhibited IFN-gamma-induced degradation of tryptophan by the heme protein, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase. In contrast, tin-protoporphyrin enhanced the IFN-gamma effects as seen by increased neopterin production, enhanced tryptophan degradation, and elevated HLA-DR antigen expression on cells. These effects are considered to be due to the action of heme, metalloporphyrins, iron, or heme byproducts on the IFN-gamma signal, rather than to direct effects on IFN-gamma-induced enzymatic pathways. Heme and metalloporphyrins were previously shown to affect heme oxygenase activity, T cell growth, and lipid peroxidation and to modulate interleukin 2 activity. These pathways are also known to be influenced by IFN-gamma, and our data suggest that heme and metalloporphyrins may directly modulate the efficiency of the IFN-gamma signal.","['Weiss, G', 'Lutton, J D', 'Fuchs, D', 'Werner-Felmayer, G', 'Bock, G', 'Abraham, N G', 'Kappas, A', 'Levere, R D', 'Wachter, H']","['Weiss G', 'Lutton JD', 'Fuchs D', 'Werner-Felmayer G', 'Bock G', 'Abraham NG', 'Kappas A', 'Levere RD', 'Wachter H']","['Institute for Medical Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Innsbruck, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Soc Exp Biol Med,"Proceedings of the Society for Experimental Biology and Medicine.

Forty-five cycles of RT-PCR were used to detect residual t(8;21)-positive leukemia cells in three patients who had been in complete remission for 1, 3 and 5 years.

We investigated the effect of bcl-2 expression on cellular sensitivity to lysis by tumor necrosis factor (TNF), a cytokine capable of inducing apoptosis in several tumor cell lines. Introduction of the human bcl-2 gene in the highly TNF-sensitive L929 mouse fibrosarcoma cell line did not result in altered TNF sensitivity. Likewise, NIH3T3 and REF cells, which are resistant to TNF cytotoxicity but become TNF sensitive upon cotreatment with actinomycin D or upon expression of the adenovirus E1A gene, did not show altered TNF sensitivity upon bcl-2 transfection. Despite constitutive expression of the endogenous bcl-2 gene, human MCF7 breast carcinoma cells, as well as HL60 promyelocytic leukemia and U937 histiocytic lymphoma cell lines were found to be TNF sensitive. bcl-2-overexpressing derivatives of these cell lines did not acquire reduced TNF sensitivity and still exhibited the characteristic pattern of internucleosomal DNA fragmentation of TNF-induced apoptosis. Moreover, bcl-2 expression in the interleukin 3 (IL-3)-dependent myeloid cell line 32D protected these cells from apoptosis resulting from growth factor deprivation, but not from apoptosis induced by TNF. These data clearly establish the absence of a correlation between bcl-2 gene expression and cellular sensitivity to TNF-induced cell lysis.

ABL-MYC, a retrovirus that expresses both v-abl and c-myc, induces solely plasmacytomas in BALB/c mice. To investigate how the addition of overexpression of c-myc to that of v-abl accomplishes this dramatic change in the phenotype of the cells transformed by these closely related retroviruses, we utilized helper-free A-MuLV (psi 2) and ABL-MYC (psi 2) in vitro to infect suspensions of cells from different lymphoid tissues and purified immature and purified mature B cells. As expected, A-MuLV(psi 2) induced only pre-B-cell lymphomas in vivo and in vitro when immature B cells were present. ABL-MYC(psi 2), on the other hand, produced only plasmacytomas, even when purified immature B lymphocytes were infected in vitro. Although the A-MuLV(psi 2)-induced pre-B-cell lymphomas express easily detectable levels of c-myc mRNA, maturation into more-mature forms of B lymphocytes is blocked. The constitutively overexpressed c-myc in the ABL-MYC retrovirus abrogates this block, permits maturation of infected immature B cells, and yields transformed plasma cells.","['Weissinger, E M', 'Mischak, H', 'Goodnight, J', 'Davidson, W F', 'Mushinski, J F']","['Weissinger EM', 'Mischak H', 'Goodnight J', 'Davidson WF', 'Mushinski JF']","['Molecular Genetics Section, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Abelson murine leukemia virus/*genetics/pathogenicity', 'Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/*microbiology', 'Cell Transformation, Viral/*genetics', 'Defective Viruses/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', '*Genes, myc', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Phenotype', 'Plasmacytoma/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics']",1993/04/01 00:00,1993/04/01 00:01,['1993/04/01 00:00'],"['1993/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/mcb.13.4.2578-2585.1993 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1993 Apr;13(4):2578-85. doi: 10.1128/mcb.13.4.2578-2585.1993.,,,,,PMC359590,,,,,

The cis-DNA element (GRR) previously found to confer IFN-gamma responsiveness to this gene acts as an inducible enhancer and is the target of an IFN-gamma-activated factor(s) (GIRE-BP) in cells of different origins. Although the GRR motif is not related to the DNA elements involved in the regulation of other IFN-stimulated genes, GIRE-BP binding depends on the IFN-gamma-dependent activation of the 91-kDa protein known to be one of the factors of a transcriptional complex activated by IFN-alpha. Deletions of the Fc gamma R1 promoter allowed us to identify a 25-bp element, downstream from the GRR motif, conferring cell-type-specific expression. This element, called MATE (myeloid activating transcription element), is the DNA target for constitutive factors forming two complexes, MATE-BP1 and MATE-BP2. In accordance with the functional analysis, MATE-BP binding activities were detected in extracts prepared from myeloid cell lines such as THP-1, HL-60, and U-937 but not in HeLa cell extracts. The MATE motif is present not only in the promoter of other Fc receptor genes but also in several promoters of genes whose expression is restricted to monocytic cells. Our results suggest that human Fc gamma R1 gene expression in myeloid cells is initiated by the interaction of IFN-gamma-activated factors with cell-type-specific factors through their binding to the GRR and MATE motifs.","['Perez, C', 'Wietzerbin, J', 'Benech, P D']","['Perez C', 'Wietzerbin J', 'Benech PD']","['Unite 196 Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale, Section Biologie, Institut Curie, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (IRF1 protein, human)', '0 (IRF9 protein, human)', '0 (Interferon Regulatory Factor-1)', '0 (Interferon-Stimulated Gene Factor 3)', '0 (Interferon-Stimulated Gene Factor 3, gamma Subunit)', '0 (Irf1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Isgf3g protein, mouse)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Consensus Sequence', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', '*Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects', 'HeLa Cells', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Interferon Regulatory Factor-1', 'Interferon-Stimulated Gene Factor 3', 'Interferon-Stimulated Gene Factor 3, gamma Subunit', 'Interferon-gamma/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides/chemistry', 'Phosphoproteins/genetics', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Receptors, IgG/*genetics', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/04/01 00:00,1993/04/01 00:01,['1993/04/01 00:00'],"['1993/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/mcb.13.4.2182-2192.1993 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1993 Apr;13(4):2182-92. doi: 10.1128/mcb.13.4.2182-2192.1993.,,,"['CD11-b', 'Fc&ggr;RI', 'c-fes', 'gp91-phox', 'mig']",,PMC359539,,,,,

The original construct was highly transforming in tissue culture but produced no detectable pathologies in vivo with the exception of a single fibrosarcoma which arose after a long latency. The virus produced by this tumor appears to have undergone a complex series of recombination events involving the helper Moloney murine leukemia virus. It encodes an Env/K-FGF fusion protein whose expression is under the control of a hybrid long terminal repeat. This virus (designated MFS, for meningeal fibrosarcoma) induces tumors in mice with high frequency and short latency. These neoplasms consist of aggressive fibrosarcomas of soft tissue as well as diffuse meningeal tumors originating from the dura mater that surround the whole central nervous system and cause severe hydrocephalus. The Env/K-FGF fusion protein expressed by the MFS virus has retained all of the biological properties of native K-FGF, including secretion, mitogenic activity, heparin binding, and neutralization by anti-K-FGF antibodies. These and other results indicate that the tumors induced by the MFS virus result from the oncogenic potential of K-FGF.","['Talarico, D', 'Ittmann, M M', 'Bronson, R', 'Basilico, C']","['Talarico D', 'Ittmann MM', 'Bronson R', 'Basilico C']","['Department of Microbiology, Kaplan Cancer Center, New York University School of Medicine, New York 10016.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Fibrosarcoma/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genetic Vectors', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Meningeal Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred ICR', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Transfection']",1993/04/01 00:00,1993/04/01 00:01,['1993/04/01 00:00'],"['1993/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/mcb.13.4.1998-2010.1993 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1993 Apr;13(4):1998-2010. doi: 10.1128/mcb.13.4.1998-2010.1993.,,,"['K-fgf', 'hst']",,PMC359521,,,['CA42568/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,

These reports have led to growing concern among oncologists, which could lead to premature abandonment of these agents at a time when the relationship between cumulative dose of epipodophyllotoxin and risk of treatment-related AML has not been determined. PURPOSE: Because of the increasingly important role of epipodophyllotoxins in the treatment of several types of adult and pediatric tumors, the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) has developed a monitoring plan to obtain reliable estimates of the risk of treatment-related AML following epipodophyllotoxin treatment. METHODS: We identified 12 NCI-supported Cooperative Group clinical trials in which patients with solid tumors are being treated with epipodophyllotoxins at different cumulative doses. One trial is using a moderate dose of teniposide (900 mg/m2), and 11 trials are using etoposide at a low dose (< 1500 mg/m2), a moderate dose (1500-3999 mg/m2), or a high dose (> or = 4000 mg/m2). Cases of treatment-related AML and treatment-related myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) (hereafter referred to as treatment-related AML/MDS) occurring in these trials are reported to CTEP, with initial analysis for each cumulative dose group triggered by the reporting of four cases of treatment-related AML/MDS in that group. For each analysis, total patient follow-up for the group is determined and cumulative 6-year incidence rate is calculated. RESULTS: Three cases of treatment-related AML and one case of treatment-related MDS (with documented monosomy 7) were reported in a group of 207 patients who received etoposide at a low cumulative dose. The calculated 6-year rate of development of treatment-related AML/MDS was 3.2% (95% upper confidence interval bounded by 7.2%). CONCLUSIONS: The 6-year cumulative rate of treatment-related AML/MDS (3.2%) is within the range previously reported for alkylator-based regimens that did not include epipodophyllotoxins. IMPLICATIONS: Previous reports have suggested that higher cumulative doses of alkylators are associated with increased risk of treatment-related AML, and a critical goal of the monitoring plan is to determine whether a similar relationship exists for the epipodophyllotoxins. Estimates will be developed for leukemogenic risk for the moderate- and high-cumulative-dose groups when four cases of treatment-related AML/MDS have been identified within each group.","['Smith, M A', 'Rubinstein, L', 'Cazenave, L', 'Ungerleider, R S', 'Maurer, H M', 'Heyn, R', 'Khan, F M', 'Gehan, E']","['Smith MA', 'Rubinstein L', 'Cazenave L', 'Ungerleider RS', 'Maurer HM', 'Heyn R', 'Khan FM', 'Gehan E']","['Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,"['6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'L36H50F353 (Podophyllotoxin)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Etoposide/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*chemically induced', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*chemically induced', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*chemically induced', 'Podophyllotoxin/*adverse effects']",1993/04/07 00:00,1993/04/07 00:01,['1993/04/07 00:00'],"['1993/04/07 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/04/07 00:01 [medline]', '1993/04/07 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/jnci/85.7.554 [doi]'],ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1993 Apr 7;85(7):554-8. doi: 10.1093/jnci/85.7.554.,,,,,,,,"['CA-24507/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-30138/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-30969/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,

However, the ability of long-term AZT treatment to sustain increases in platelet counts is controversial. We have recently demonstrated that AZT elevates the levels of circulating platelets in both normal C57BL/6 mice and mice made immunodeficient by infection with LP-BM5 murine leukemia virus (MAIDS mice). We therefore studied the effect of long-term AZT administration on platelet formation in both normal and MAIDS mice. Peripheral blood indices, levels of femoral and splenic megakaryocyte colony forming units (CFU-MK), and plasma levels of cytokines important in platelet formation-interleukin-6 (IL-6) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)--were examined. Platelet counts remained elevated throughout a 120-day AZT treatment period. Splenic CFU-MK were not significantly changed in MAIDS mice, except at day 15 when they were elevated. Splenic CFU-MK were significantly decreased in normal mice at days 8 and 120, and increased at day 30. Bone marrow CFU-MK were increased by AZT treatment at all time points tested in both normal and MAIDS mice. Plasma levels of GM-CSF were unchanged by AZT treatment in both normal and MAIDS mice. Plasma levels of IL-6 were unchanged in AZT-treated normal mice but decreased in AZT-treated MAIDS mice. These results indicate that long-term AZT treatment maintains elevated levels of platelets in both normal and MAIDS mice and affects CFU-MK colony formation. Our studies add to a growing body of work suggesting that AZT can ameliorate thrombocytopenia associated with HIV disease.","['Chow, F P', 'Chen, R B', 'Hamburger, A W']","['Chow FP', 'Chen RB', 'Hamburger AW']","['University of Maryland Cancer Center, Baltimore 21201.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Lab Clin Med,The Journal of laboratory and clinical medicine,0375375,"['0 (Interleukin-6)', '4B9XT59T7S (Zidovudine)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Female', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/blood', 'Interleukin-6/blood', 'Megakaryocytes/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Murine Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/*blood/drug therapy', 'Platelet Count/*drug effects', 'Time Factors', 'Zidovudine/*pharmacology/therapeutic use']",1993/04/01 00:00,1993/04/01 00:01,['1993/04/01 00:00'],"['1993/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['0022-2143(93)90091-C [pii]'],ppublish,J Lab Clin Med. 1993 Apr;121(4):562-9.,,,,['J Lab Clin Med. 1993 Apr;121(4):536-8.

Selenium-deficient rat basophilic leukemia cells had < 1% of control glutathione peroxidase activity and 35% of control phospholipid hydroperoxide-glutathione peroxidase activity. Upon stimulation, these cells released an 8-fold amount of lipoxygenase metabolites compared to controls. No (5S)-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid was detectable in whole cells; however, it was found in homogenates of selenium-deficient cells. Addition of 0.25 microgram/ml selenium to selenium-deficient cells restored control phospholipid hydroperoxide-glutathione peroxidase activity within 8 h, whereas glutathione peroxidase activity needed 7 days. 12 h after resupplementation, selenium-deficient cells had 3% glutathione peroxidase and 100% phospholipid hydroperoxide-glutathione peroxidase activity compared to controls. Resupplemented cells released control amounts of 5-lipoxygenase metabolites, indicating that restoration of phospholipid hydroperoxide-glutathione peroxidase activity is associated with a selenium-adequate leukotriene metabolism. Leukocytes that were isolated from selenium-deficient rats released a 7-fold amount of total lipoxygenase metabolites compared to cells from control animals. By injecting normally fed rats with 500 micrograms/kg selenium as Na2SeO3, leukocyte phospholipid hydroperoxide-glutathione peroxidase activity was raised 8-fold within 114 h compared to controls. Leukocytes from these animals produced significantly less lipoxygenase metabolites than controls. These findings indicate that phospholipid hydroperoxide-glutathione peroxidase activity is primarily responsible for the reduction of 5-hydroperoxyeicosate-traenoic acid and therefore governs the actual activity of leukocyte 5-lipoxygenase via regulating the tone of endogenous hydroperoxides.","['Weitzel, F', 'Wendel, A']","['Weitzel F', 'Wendel A']","['Faculty of Biology, University of Konstanz, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Peroxides)', 'EC 1.11.1.9 (Glutathione Peroxidase)', 'EC 1.13.11.34 (Arachidonate 5-Lipoxygenase)', 'H6241UJ22B (Selenium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Arachidonate 5-Lipoxygenase/*metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Glutathione Peroxidase/*metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Leukocytes/*enzymology', 'Male', 'Peroxides/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Selenium/deficiency/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/03/25 00:00,1993/03/25 00:01,['1993/03/25 00:00'],"['1993/03/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/03/25 00:01 [medline]', '1993/03/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(18)53251-8 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1993 Mar 25;268(9):6288-92.,,,,,,,,,,

Measurement of the rate of transcription by nuclear ""run-on"" assays showed that increased mdr3 expression in P388/VCR cells was caused by transcriptional activation of the gene. Analysis of the 5' end of mdr3 mRNA transcripts by primer extension indicated that in P388/VCR cells, these mRNAs extended approximately 200 nucleotides upstream exon 2, about 60 nucleotides longer than their counterparts expressed in normal tissues from the known transcription start site of the gene (TS1). Northern blotting experiments using discrete exon and intron probes derived from the 5' end of the gene near TS1, together with ribonuclease protection using a complementary RNA probe from the same region, demonstrated that transcriptional activation in P388/VCR cells occurred from a novel transcription start site named TS3, located either upstream of TS1 or within intron 1 at a site immediately upstream a novel exon. In P388/ADM-2 cells, Northern blotting and ribonuclease protection identified overexpressed mdr3 mRNAs initiating near TS1 and a large partially spliced mdr3 mRNA species initiating upstream of TS1 at a novel initiation site designated TS2.

We studied the in vitro cytotoxicity, cellular pharmacology, and DNA damage induced by AN in P388 cells sensitive and resistant to doxorubicin (DOX). AN was as cytotoxic as DOX against P388-sensitive cells and about 50 times more cytotoxic than DOX against P388-resistant cells (resistance index 5 for AN versus 250 for DOX). Cellular uptake of AN by sensitive cells was 2-3-fold higher than that of DOX. In resistant cells, cellular uptake of AN and DOX was approximately 65% and 30%, respectively, of the cellular uptake in sensitive cells. As a result, cellular uptake of AN by resistant cells was higher than uptake of DOX by sensitive cells. DOX was fully retained in sensitive cells while it was effluxed rapidly from resistant cells. In contrast, efflux of AN was similar in sensitive and resistant cells, thus suggesting that it is not mediated by P-glycoprotein. AN was more effective than DOX in inducing single DNA breaks, double DNA breaks, and DNA-protein cross-links, both in sensitive and resistant cells, although DNA damage was lower in resistant cells than in sensitive cells. DNA lesions induced by AN in resistant cells were similar to or greater than those induced by DOX in sensitive cells.

The antitumor activity was evaluated with PALA administered i.v. 24 h prior to the maximum tolerated dose of FUra and FdUrd administered by: (a) 4 days of continuous infusion (schedule 1, c.i. days 1-4); (b) daily for 4 days by i.v. push (schedule 2, i.v. days 1-4); and (c) weekly for 3 weeks (schedule 3, i.v. weekly for 3 weeks).

At the maximum tolerated doses, the antitumor activity in mice bearing advanced colon carcinoma can be summarized as follows: (a) FdUrd is significantly more active than FUra; (b) for both drugs the weekly for 3 weeks i.v. push schedule is superior to the c.i. or i.v. push daily for 4 days schedules; (c) pretreatment with PALA enhances the antitumor activity of FdUrd and FUra and resulted in 95 and 13% complete responses, respectively; (d) long-term survivors with FUra could only be achieved in the presence of PALA; in mice bearing leukemia 1210 cells, FdUrd or FUra with or without PALA exhibited no significant antitumor activity when PALA was administered in a single dose 24 h prior to fluoropyrimidine treatment; and (e) in C-26 and L1210, PALA reduced the pools of CTP and UTP equally, to about 10% of controls with significant difference in their rates of recovery.","['van Laar, J A', 'Durrani, F A', 'Rustum, Y M']","['van Laar JA', 'Durrani FA', 'Rustum YM']","['Grace Cancer Drug Center, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, New York 14263.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '039LU44I5M (Floxuridine)', '30KYC7MIAI (Aspartic Acid)', '65-47-4 (Cytidine Triphosphate)', '78QVZ7RG8L (sparfosic acid)', 'N919E46723 (Phosphonoacetic Acid)', 'UT0S826Z60 (Uridine Triphosphate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Aspartic Acid/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Colonic Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Cytidine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Floxuridine/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Phosphonoacetic Acid/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Uridine Triphosphate/metabolism']",1993/04/01 00:00,1993/04/01 00:01,['1993/04/01 00:00'],"['1993/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1993 Apr 1;53(7):1560-4.,,,,,,,,"['CA16056/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA18420/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA21071/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,

ANLL patients received busulfan and cytoxan, and the others received cytoxan and total body irradiation as their preparative regimen before transplant. BM was purged ex vivo with 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide (4-HC) at 30-100 micrograms/ml before reinfusion to kill tumor cells. Cytogenetic analysis was performed before and after transplant. Between one and four posttransplant specimens of BM were analyzed per patient (range 36-921 days). Chromosome abnormalities were observed in 14 of 55 patients after transplant. Seven had clonal abnormalities; all were in leukemic relapse, and one karyotype had complex rearrangements. Clonal abnormalities of chromosome 1 were not observed. Seven patients had nonclonal changes, and three of these have had overt clinical relapse. Our data suggest that clonal abnormalities observed posttransplant are best explained by clinical relapse of tumor and that ex vivo marrow purging with 4-HC is not likely to induce clonal chromosome abnormalities in normal cells.

Recently, the authors performed a second examination of cutaneous, muscle, and nerve biopsy specimens from a French white woman who died of ATLL in 1979. METHODS: A 67-year-old white woman had a lymphoma diagnosed on a lymph node biopsy. She then had acute pains and a thickened skin on both legs. Blood examination showed a leukocyte count of 16,000/ml with 75% leukemia T-cells. Biopsies were performed on the antero-external surface of the right leg. She died after 2 years of illness. RESULTS: Lymphomatous infiltrates of T-cell origin were seen in the dermis, between muscle fibers, and in a peripheral nerve. The recent ultrastructural examination of a few vacuoles located in the cytoplasm of certain lymphomatous cells showed rounded structures mixed with larger virus-like formations having a central nucleoid and spike material around the envelope. Polymerase chain reaction experiments performed on deparaffinized sections demonstrated the presence of a tax sequence homologous to that of HTLV-I. Other structural genes were not detected. CONCLUSIONS: These results contrast with other ultrastructural studies in which HTLV-I was detected only after cultivation of leukemia cells from patients with ATLL. This case probably resulted from an HTLV-I variant.","['Vital, C', 'Vital, A', 'Moynet, D', 'Broustet, A', 'de Mascarel, A', 'Bloch, B', 'Guillemain, B']","['Vital C', 'Vital A', 'Moynet D', 'Broustet A', 'de Mascarel A', 'Bloch B', 'Guillemain B']","['Department of Neuropathology, Bordeaux II University, France.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Base Sequence', 'Biopsy', 'DNA, Viral/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Amplification', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics/ultrastructure', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 2/genetics', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*microbiology/pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Virion/*genetics']",1993/04/01 00:00,1993/04/01 00:01,['1993/04/01 00:00'],"['1993/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19930401)71:7<2227::aid-cncr2820710711>3.0.co;2-u [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1993 Apr 1;71(7):2227-32. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19930401)71:7<2227::aid-cncr2820710711>3.0.co;2-u.,,,"['env', 'gag', 'pol I', 'tax']",,,,,,,

Splenic metastasis as an initial manifestation of disease and sole site of metastasis has not been reported previously. METHODS: The authors describe a patient with hairy cell leukemia (HCL) with the unexpected finding of metastatic adenocarcinoma in the spleen. Direct inspection at the time of laparotomy and subsequent radiographic studies did not show a primary or additional metastatic tumor. Eventually, he manifested evidence of pulmonary and hepatic metastases and died with fungal sepsis. RESULTS: The splenectomy specimen showed HCL and metastatic adenocarcinoma. Immunohistochemical studies showed adenocarcinoma with diffuse cytoplasmic staining for prostate-specific antigen and focally positive results with prostatic acid phosphatase antigen. Postmortem examination 9 months later showed HCL and widespread metastatic adenocarcinoma. No primary tumor was identified, and multiple tissue blocks of the prostate had negative findings for tumor. CONCLUSIONS: The immunohistologic features of the metastatic adenocarcinoma were interpreted as prostatic in origin. The pattern of isolated metastatic disease in the absence of primary tumor appears to represent another possible atypical disease presentation of prostatic cancer. Hairy cell-induced structural and immunologic alterations within the splenic microenvironment may have contributed to this unique clinical presentation.","['Sharpe, R W', 'Rector, J T', 'Rushin, J M', 'Garvin, D F', 'Cotelingam, J D']","['Sharpe RW', 'Rector JT', 'Rushin JM', 'Garvin DF', 'Cotelingam JD']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Naval Hospital of San Diego, California 92134-5000.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/*secondary', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/immunology/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Spleen/pathology/surgery', 'Splenic Neoplasms/*secondary']",1993/04/01 00:00,1993/04/01 00:01,['1993/04/01 00:00'],"['1993/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19930401)71:7<2222::aid-cncr2820710710>3.0.co;2-b [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1993 Apr 1;71(7):2222-6. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19930401)71:7<2222::aid-cncr2820710710>3.0.co;2-b.,,,,,,,,,,

The differentiated cells possessed many granules that stained with Luxol fast blue and acquired the ability to produce leukotriene C4 and eosinophil cationic protein (ECP), and migrated toward some eosinophillotactic attractants, including PAF, IL-5, IL-3 and GM-CSF. Monoclonal antibody to GM-CSF and IL-5, especially GM-CSF, strongly decreased the ability of BA to induce differentiation, whereas antibody to IL-3 did not. Recombinant human (rh) IL-3, rhGM-CSF and recombinant mouse (rm) IL-5, by themselves, did not have the ability to induce differentiation. On the other hand, the presence of these cytokines significantly (p < 0.01) augmented BA-induced cell differentiation. Other cytokines including rhIL-1 alpha/beta, rhIL-2, rhIL-4, rhIL-6, rhIL-8, rhTNF-alpha and rhIFN-gamma had no effect on differentiation. Expression of GM-CSF and GM-CSF receptor mRNA was detected in cellular RNA obtained from BA-stimulated EoL-1 cells. Moreover, about 5-10 pg/ml of GM-CSF was detected in the culture supernatant of BA-stimulated EoL-1 cells. These findings suggested that BA-induced EoL-1 cell differentiation was elicited under the influence of GM-CSF endogenously produced in these cells. GM-CSF also seemed to be an autocrine differentiating factor in EoL-1 cells.","['Saito, H', 'Hayakawa, T', 'Mita, H', 'Akiyama, K', 'Shida, T']","['Saito H', 'Hayakawa T', 'Mita H', 'Akiyama K', 'Shida T']","['Clinical Research Center for Rheumato-Allergology, Sagamihara National Hospital, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Int Arch Allergy Immunol,International archives of allergy and immunology,9211652,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Blood Proteins)', '0 (Butyrates)', '0 (Eosinophil Granule Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Interleukin-5)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (SRS-A)', '107-92-6 (Butyric Acid)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 3.1.- (Ribonucleases)']",IM,"['Antibodies/pharmacology', 'Base Sequence', 'Blood Proteins/analysis', 'Butyrates/*pharmacology', 'Butyric Acid', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Movement', 'Drug Synergism', 'Eosinophil Granule Proteins', 'Eosinophils/*cytology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/genetics/immunology/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/immunology/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-5/immunology/pharmacology', 'Leukemia', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/genetics', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', '*Ribonucleases', 'SRS-A/biosynthesis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/chemistry/metabolism']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1159/000236418 [doi]'],ppublish,Int Arch Allergy Immunol. 1993;100(3):240-7. doi: 10.1159/000236418.,,,,,,,,,,

These results indicate that human macrophages are susceptible in vitro to productive HTLV-1 infection, and thus might be involved in the pathogenesis of HTLV-1-related diseases.","['de Revel, T', 'Mabondzo, A', 'Gras, G', 'Delord, B', 'Roques, P', 'Boussin, F', 'Neveux, Y', 'Bahuau, M', 'Fleury, H J', 'Dormont, D']","['de Revel T', 'Mabondzo A', 'Gras G', 'Delord B', 'Roques P', 'Boussin F', 'Neveux Y', 'Bahuau M', 'Fleury HJ', 'Dormont D']","[""Laboratoire de Neuropathologie experimentale et Neurovirologie, CRSSA, DSV/DPTE, Commissariat a l'Energie Atomique, Fontenay aux-Roses, France.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (HTLV-I Antigens)']",IM,"['Cells, Cultured', 'DNA, Viral/analysis', 'Fetal Blood/microbiology', 'HTLV-I Antigens/analysis', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/*growth & development/isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Lymphocytes/microbiology', 'Macrophages/*microbiology', 'Proviruses/genetics']",1993/03/15 00:00,1993/03/15 00:01,['1993/03/15 00:00'],"['1993/03/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/03/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/03/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)74711-7 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1993 Mar 15;81(6):1598-606.,,,,,,,,,,

Within the hematopoietic system, the effects of IL-11 are largely manifest only through combination with other cytokines, including IL-3 and Steel factor (SF). In the present study, we addressed the question of IL-11 responsiveness within the different types of human leukemic cells, as well as the mechanism of action of IL-11 at the cellular level. Analysis of a panel of samples from different patients with acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) and myeloid leukemic cell lines indicated that IL-11 alone was ineffective in supporting myeloid leukemic cell growth but frequently enhanced growth supported by IL-3, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), or SF. In contrast, three acute pre-B lymphocytic leukemia (pre-B-ALL) and two acute T lymphocytic leukemia (T-ALL) lines failed to respond to IL-11 alone or when combined with other cytokines. The growth enhancement of IL-11 among the AML patient samples was dose dependent and remarkably constant with half-efficient concentrations in the range of 0.3 to 0.4 ng/mL. The thymidine suicide studies with the patient samples revealed that 40% to 50% of the blast cells were in S-phase when exposed for 16 hours to IL-3 and this level was increased to 70% to 90% in response to either IL-11 or IL-6. Our data suggest that the latter two interleukins act synergistically with the direct mitogenic factor, IL-3, in triggering AML blast-cell proliferation. Detailed analysis with several patient samples further revealed that SF and IL-11 both enhance IL-3-supported clonogenic growth of AML blasts and the combination of all three growth factors yields optimal growth. In contrast, IL-6 does not further enhance the effect of IL-11. These results indicate that SF and IL-11 enhance IL-3-dependent clonogenic growth through two distinct pathways, whereas IL-6 and IL-11 may trigger the same pathway.","['Hu, J P', 'Cesano, A', 'Santoli, D', 'Clark, S C', 'Hoang, T']","['Hu JP', 'Cesano A', 'Santoli D', 'Clark SC', 'Hoang T']","['Clinical Research Institute of Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Interleukin-11)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-11/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/03/15 00:00,1993/03/15 00:01,['1993/03/15 00:00'],"['1993/03/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/03/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/03/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)74709-9 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1993 Mar 15;81(6):1586-92.,,,,,,,,['CA-47589/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,

This report provides evidence of the duplication of small segments within the M-bcr in a small group of patients with CML. Southern blots of Bgl II and Bgl II/BamHI double-digested DNA from the blood or bone marrow of 46 patients with CML were probed with a 5' 1.4-kb Taq I/HindIII M-bcr probe and a 3' 2-kb HindIII/BamHI M-bcr probe. In three patients, rearrangements were noted with both probes in Bgl II-digested DNA, but were not present in Bgl II/BamHI-digested DNA with either probe. Southern analysis of DNA samples double-digested with Bgl II and BspHI from two of these three cases showed no rearrangements with either probe; the M-bcr BspHI site is located 26 bp 3' of the BamHI site in the second intron of the M-bcr. The presence of a rearranged M-bcr with both probes in Bgl II-digested DNA and the lack of rearrangement in Bgl II/BamHI and Bgl II/BspHI double-digested DNA suggest the presence of M-bcr BamHI and BspHI sites on both 9q+ chromosome (9q+) and the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph). This implies a duplication of at least the 26-bp M-bcr BamHI/BspHI fragment in these two samples. Sequence data from one of these two cases confirmed the M-bcr breakpoints to be staggered; the Ph M-bcr breakpoint occurred 258 bp downstream from the 9q+ M-bcr breakpoint. It is concluded that a duplication of small segments within the M-bcr occurs in a small group of patients with CML, which may lead to pseudogermline patterns on Southern blot. Such a duplication may provide insight into the mechanism of some chromosomal translocations in neoplasia.","['Litz, C E', 'McClure, J S', 'Copenhaver, C M', 'Brunning, R D']","['Litz CE', 'McClure JS', 'Copenhaver CM', 'Brunning RD']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, University of Minnesota Medical School, Minneapolis.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (BCR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 22', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Multigene Family', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', '*Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr', '*Proto-Oncogenes']",1993/03/15 00:00,1993/03/15 00:01,['1993/03/15 00:00'],"['1993/03/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/03/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/03/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)74706-3 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1993 Mar 15;81(6):1567-72.,,,['M-bcr'],,,,,,"['GENBANK/S62176', 'GENBANK/S62178', 'GENBANK/S62179', 'GENBANK/S62182', 'GENBANK/S62184', 'GENBANK/S65583', 'GENBANK/S65606', 'GENBANK/U07000', 'GENBANK/U07563', 'GENBANK/X59067']",

Only one study has evaluated directly the relation between estimates of butadiene exposure and leukemia, and this investigation reports a positive association.

These results indicate an association between PMA-induced terminal differentiation along the monocyte/macrophage cell lineage and PMA-evoked increases in specific GSLs, GM3 in particular, which is due to a rise in the activity of its synthetic enzyme.","['Kiguchi, K', 'Henning-Chubb, C', 'Huberman, E']","['Kiguchi K', 'Henning-Chubb C', 'Huberman E']","['Biological and Medical Research Division, Argonne National Laboratory, Illinois 60439.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (G(M3) Ganglioside)', '0 (Glycosphingolipids)', 'EC 2.4.99.- (Sialyltransferases)', 'EC 2.4.99.1 (beta-D-galactoside alpha 2-6-sialyltransferase)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Carbohydrate Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Induction/drug effects', 'G(M3) Ganglioside/biosynthesis', 'Glycosphingolipids/*biosynthesis/chemistry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Monocytes/metabolism', 'Sialyltransferases/metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*drug effects']",1993/03/10 00:00,1993/03/10 00:01,['1993/03/10 00:00'],"['1993/03/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/03/10 00:01 [medline]', '1993/03/10 00:00 [entrez]']","['0167-4889(93)90173-M [pii]', '10.1016/0167-4889(93)90173-m [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1993 Mar 10;1176(1-2):27-36. doi: 10.1016/0167-4889(93)90173-m.,,,,,,,,,,

Clinical presentation, management and avoidance.",213-24,"Haematological complications frequently occur in patients treated with chemotherapeutic agents. The degree and duration of bone marrow suppression depends upon the type of agent used. In general, agents that are cell cycle phase-specific tend to cause early myelosuppression with rapid marrow recovery, as compared to the non-phase-specific agents. Host factors including patient age, nutritional status, marrow infiltration or damage, and hepatic and renal function also affect haemotoxicity. Chemotherapeutic agents suppress proliferating or potentially proliferating precursors of neutrophils, platelets and red blood cells to the same extent. With most drugs, neutropenia tends to be dose limiting and more severe than thrombocytopenia. Because of the longer life span of red blood cells, severe anaemia is rarely a problem. The management of myelosuppression is multifaceted, and consists of aggressive antibiotic therapy to treat or prevent the infections that occur with neutropenia, as well as red blood cell and platelet transfusion support to correct anaemia and prevent bleeding. The role of the haemopoietic growth factors including erythropoietin, colony-stimulating factors and the interleukins is currently being evaluated in clinical trials. Haemolytic uraemic syndrome, haemolytic anaemia and therapy-induced myelodysplasia and/or acute leukaemia are uncommon and potentially severe complications of chemotherapeutic agents.","['Bodensteiner, D C', 'Doolittle, G C']","['Bodensteiner DC', 'Doolittle GC']","['University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",New Zealand,Drug Saf,Drug safety,9002928,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Agranulocytosis/*chemically induced/therapy', 'Anemia/*chemically induced/therapy', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects/immunology', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Hemolytic-Uremic Syndrome/chemically induced/therapy', 'Humans', 'Nutritional Status', 'Thrombocytopenia/*chemically induced/therapy']",1993/03/01 00:00,1993/03/01 00:01,['1993/03/01 00:00'],"['1993/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.2165/00002018-199308030-00003 [doi]'],ppublish,Drug Saf. 1993 Mar;8(3):213-24. doi: 10.2165/00002018-199308030-00003.,49,,,,,,,,,

Our limited success in treating epithelial neoplasms may be due to insensitivity rather than to drug resistance. Well-designed attempts to overcome resistance have been unsuccessful. The acquired immunodeficiency syndrome has not confirmed the putative role of immune surveillance in the pathogenesis of most neoplasms. The limited success of the most elaborate immunotherapies suggests that they, too, are nonspecific cell-killing techniques. Immunologic and cytotoxic drug therapies deserve further investigation but on a smaller scale. Neoplastic cell molecular biology, unknown when these therapies were developed, is being rapidly elucidated and may make it possible to treat malignancies by modulating cell physiology.

The two patients who received the initial dose of 20 x 10(6) U/m2/day (1.0 mg/m2/day) could only tolerate 6 days of therapy because of severe hepatotoxicity. Two patients who received the revised starting dose of 10 x 10(6) U/m2/day also could not complete a full course of rIFN gamma due to renal failure in one case and pulmonary deterioration in the other. A reversible dose-related rise in SGOT was seen in six patients. All patients developed a severe flu-like syndrome characterized by myalgias and fevers. These toxicities were not associated with detectable serum levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Although blasts from three of five assessable patients displayed increased expression of the Ia (HLA-DR) antigen, there were no hematological responses. Steady-state rIFN gamma plasma levels in patients who tolerated a complete infusion were < 40 U/ml, a concentration below that required to induce differentiation of myeloid leukemic cell lines in vitro.

On review of the literature, headache and confusion at 1-2 months post-transplant are common presenting signs of central nervous system toxoplasmosis. The predominance of neutrophils in the spinal fluid in this patient probably reflects the meningeal component of the infection and is an unusual finding.

This observation also underlines the role of the initial endo-alveolar fibrosis in the ultimate development of interstitial fibrosis.","['About, I', 'Lauque, D', 'Levenes, H', 'Mazerolles, C', 'Pujazon, M C', 'Pris, J', 'Carles, P']","['About I', 'Lauque D', 'Levenes H', 'Mazerolles C', 'Pujazon MC', 'Pris J', 'Carles P']","['Service de Medecine Interne, CHU Purpan, Toulouse.']",['fre'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",France,Rev Mal Respir,Revue des maladies respiratoires,8408032,['G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)'],IM,"['Aged', 'Biopsy', 'Blood Gas Analysis', 'Busulfan/*adverse effects', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/*drug therapy', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Lung Volume Measurements', 'Male', 'Pneumonia/chemically induced/*diagnostic imaging/pathology', 'Pulmonary Alveoli/*pathology', 'Radiography']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Rev Mal Respir. 1993;10(1):39-41.,9,,,,,Opacites alveolaires et pneumopathie au busulfan.,,,,

For cancers as a whole the excess relative risk, based on 227 deaths, was 0.36% per 10 mSv (90% confidence bounds -0.46, 2.45). This is quite comparable to the corresponding estimate based on the atomic bomb survivors study. There was a positive association between radiation dose and death from leukemia (excluding chronic lymphatic leukemia) P = 0.058. However, this was based on only four deaths and hence cannot sensibly be compared to estimates based on high-dose studies.

Cells were exposed in a monolayer or less, in the absence of external medium, during steady-state 1O2 generation, ensuring that singlet oxygen impinged directly and equally on all cells simultaneously. The current methodology for cell exposure ensures that 1O2 is initially the only reactive species to which the cells are exposed. Results seen with this system can therefore be attributed solely and unambiguously to events initiated by 1O2. Further, all cells in the sample receive the same magnitude of exposure per surface area per time interval, which supports calculations of the amount of 1O2 required for irreversible cell damage, based on measured 1O2 flux and exposed cell surface area. Exposure to pure 1O2 irreversibly damaged a variety of cell types, including rat basophilic leukemia, human squamous carcinoma and Chinese hamster lung fibroblast cell lines, and murine primary hepatocytes. Cell survival curves following exposure to 1O2 followed apparent first-order kinetics. A large number of singlet oxygen collisions (approximately 10(12)-10(13) were required to inactivate a cell, on average, indicating a low probability that singlet oxygen collision will reduce cell survival. Regardless of cell type or the survival endpoint measured, lethal toxicity required a fairly constant number of 1O2 collisions per cell. This poses a serious caveat in the assignment of causality in correlating 1O2-initiated cellular damage with mechanism of death, i.e. most damage observed will not be related to death.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Dahl, T A']",['Dahl TA'],"['Department of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, Tufts University Medical School, Boston, MA 02111.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Photochem Photobiol,Photochemistry and photobiology,0376425,"['17778-80-2 (Singlet Oxygen)', 'EC 1.1.1.27 (L-Lactate Dehydrogenase)', 'S88TT14065 (Oxygen)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell', 'Cell Death/*drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'L-Lactate Dehydrogenase/analysis', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute', 'Light', 'Liver/*cytology/drug effects', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Oxygen/*pharmacology', 'Photochemistry', 'Singlet Oxygen', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/02/01 00:00,1993/02/01 00:01,['1993/02/01 00:00'],"['1993/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1751-1097.1993.tb02283.x [doi]'],ppublish,Photochem Photobiol. 1993 Feb;57(2):248-54. doi: 10.1111/j.1751-1097.1993.tb02283.x.,,,,,,,,,,

In vitro NCp10 promotes genomic RNA dimerization, a process most probably linked to genomic RNA packaging, and replication primer tRNA(Pro) annealing to the initiation site of reverse transcription. To characterize the amino-acid sequences involved in the various functions of NCp10, we have synthesized by solid phase method the native protein and a series of derived peptides shortened at the N- or C-terminus with or without the zinc finger domain. In the latter case, the two parts of the protein were linked by a Glycine - Glycine spacer. The in vitro studies of these peptides show that nucleic acid annealing activities of NCp10 do not require a zinc finger but are critically dependent on the presence of specific sequences located on each side of the CCHC domain and containing proline and basic residues. Thus, deletion of 11R or 49PRPQT, of the fully active 29 residue peptide 11RQGGERRRSQLDRDGGKKPRGPRGPRPQT53 leads to a complete loss of NCp10 activity. Therefore it is proposed that in NCp10, the zinc finger directs the spatial recognition of the target RNAs by the basic domains surrounding the zinc finger.","['De Rocquigny, H', 'Ficheux, D', 'Gabus, C', 'Allain, B', 'Fournie-Zaluski, M C', 'Darlix, J L', 'Roques, B P']","['De Rocquigny H', 'Ficheux D', 'Gabus C', 'Allain B', 'Fournie-Zaluski MC', 'Darlix JL', 'Roques BP']","['Unite de Pharmacochimie moleculaire et structurale, U266 INSERM, URA D1500 CNRS, Universite Rene Descartes, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Nucleic Acids Res,Nucleic acids research,0411011,"['0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (RNA, Transfer, Pro)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Viral Core Proteins)', '129924-33-0 (retroviral nucleocapsid protein NCp10, Moloney murine leukemia', 'virus)', '9DLQ4CIU6V (Proline)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Gene Products, gag/chemistry/*physiology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Peptide Fragments', 'Proline', 'RNA, Transfer, Pro/metabolism', 'RNA, Viral/metabolism', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Transcription, Genetic/*physiology', 'Viral Core Proteins/chemistry/*physiology', 'Zinc Fingers/physiology']",1993/02/25 00:00,1993/02/25 00:01,['1993/02/25 00:00'],"['1993/02/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/02/25 00:01 [medline]', '1993/02/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/nar/21.4.823 [doi]'],ppublish,Nucleic Acids Res. 1993 Feb 25;21(4):823-9. doi: 10.1093/nar/21.4.823.,,,,,PMC309213,,,,,

Clinical case report and in vitro studies.,277-83,"Recombinant human (rh) granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-SCF) is currently being tested in clinical trials for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemias with two main intentions: reduction of neutropenia and recruitment of leukemic blasts into cell cycle to enhance cytarabine (ara-C) mediated cytotoxicity. We report a case of a fatal spleen rupture in a patient with acute monocytic leukemia (AML M5b) who was treated according to a clinical phase I/II protocol with rh GM-CSF priming and standard induction chemotherapy TAD 9 (thioguanine/ara-C/daunorubicin). During treatment we observed rapidly rising peripheral blast counts and the development of an acute abdomen. Ultrasound examination revealed splenomegaly due to diffuse cellular infiltration and spleen rupture. The patient died 17 days later due to pneumonia and renewed spleen hemorrhage. Bone marrow progenitor assays before treatment showed exclusive growth of monocytoid blast cell colonies (CFU-L). Colony growth could be stimulated with rh GM-CSF and blocked dose-dependently by a monoclonal anti-GM-CSF antibody. CFU-L proliferation also increased after stimulation with rh interleukin-3 (rh IL-3) and supra-additively with rh granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rh G-CSF) combined with rh GM-CSF. Furthermore, rh GM-CSF induced surface marker expression of CDw 65 and CD 11b on isolated CFU-L blasts. After short-term suspension culture, rh GM-CSF enhanced the expression of CD 29- and CD 11b-adhesion molecules on peripheral blast cells. In summary, this case represents a fatal spleen rupture occurring during rh GM-CSF priming and induction chemotherapy for acute monocytic leukemia. Although the etiology of this spleen rupture remains uncertain, in view of our data we suggest special caution, when further testing this therapy protocol in acute leukemias with monocytic subtype and high peripheral blast cell counts.","['Zimmer, B M', 'Berdel, W E', 'Ludwig, W D', 'Notter, M', 'Reufi, B', 'Thiel, E']","['Zimmer BM', 'Berdel WE', 'Ludwig WD', 'Notter M', 'Reufi B', 'Thiel E']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Universitatsklinikum Steglitz, Freie Universitat Berlin, F.R.G.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)', 'DAT protocol 1']",IM,"['Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects/immunology', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/physiology', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*adverse effects', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/*complications/drug therapy/immunology', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects/pathology', 'Recombinant Proteins/adverse effects', 'Splenic Rupture/chemically induced/*etiology', 'Thioguanine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1993/03/01 00:00,1993/03/01 00:01,['1993/03/01 00:00'],"['1993/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0145-2126(93)90012-A [pii]', '10.1016/0145-2126(93)90012-a [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1993 Mar;17(3):277-83. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(93)90012-a.,,,,,,,,,,

In this panel susceptibility to glucocorticoids ranged from highly sensitive to fully resistant. The panel was screened for specific 3H-dexamethasone binding in whole cells and for activation of cytosolic receptors in cell lysates. Specific binding of 3H-dexamethasone was strongly affected by the incubation temperature. In all cell lines, rapid and reversible changes were observed in the stability of agonist-receptor association with a transition temperature of 28 degrees C. Below this temperature, intracellular receptors were found to be in a stable-binding, high-affinity configuration, masking differences in receptor status among the various cell lines. When assayed at 37 degrees C, refractory and fully resistant cells revealed nonsaturating, low-affinity binding of steroid. Saturating, high-affinity binding was, however, restored in these cells by the drug meta-iodobenzylguanidine with concomitant sensitization to dexamethasone-induced lysis. Contrary to observations with intact cells, heat-induced agonist-receptor dissociation in cytosols caused irreversible loss of (re)binding capacity. Activation of cytosolic receptors only recognized fully resistant cell lines as being deficient in the transformation of liganded receptors into a DNA-binding configuration. The assay, however, could not discriminate between three cell lines with highest but varying degrees of sensitivity because of maximal activation. The results indicate that non-physiological temperature and cell disruption strongly and differentially affect steroid binding and receptor activation, respectively. The observations may account for the poor correlation between conventional predictive assays and steroid responsiveness in clinical leukaemia.","['van den Berg, J D', 'Smets, L A', 'van den Elshout, M M', 'van Geel, I P', 'Janssen, M']","['van den Berg JD', 'Smets LA', 'van den Elshout MM', 'van Geel IP', 'Janssen M']","['The Netherlands Cancer Institute/Antoni van Leeuwenhoekhuis, Division of Experimental Therapy, Amsterdam.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Iodobenzenes)', '0 (Receptors, Glucocorticoid)', '10028-17-8 (Tritium)', '35MRW7B4AD (3-Iodobenzylguanidine)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)']",IM,"['3-Iodobenzylguanidine', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Cytosol/metabolism', 'DNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Dexamethasone/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Drug Stability', 'Glucocorticoids/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Iodobenzenes/pharmacology', 'Leukemia L1210/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Phenotype', 'Receptors, Glucocorticoid/*metabolism/physiology', 'Temperature', 'Tritium', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/03/01 00:00,1993/03/01 00:01,['1993/03/01 00:00'],"['1993/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0145-2126(93)90010-I [pii]', '10.1016/0145-2126(93)90010-i [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1993 Mar;17(3):263-9. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(93)90010-i.,,,,,,,,,,

Here we have confirmed that the lipoxygenase inhibitors piriprost, nordihydroguiaretic acid and BW755C decreased DNA synthesis and proliferation of leukemic cell lines. However, the concentrations of these drugs required for half-maximal inhibition of proliferation were significantly greater than their IC50 values for 5-lipoxygenase inhibition. We therefore studied the actions of two novel, potent lipoxygenase inhibitors, BWA4C and MK886, on proliferation (as measured by estimating the number of viable, trypan blue-excluding cells) and DNA synthesis (measured by the incorporation of radiolabeled thymidine) in the leukemia cell lines HL60, K562 and Jurkat. Neither parameter was affected by concentrations of these drugs which were shown in parallel studies to substantially inhibit leukotriene generation in whole blood.

The diagnosis of minimally differentiated acute leukemia (MD-AL) was associated with a higher incidence of prior hematologic disease, lower WBC, fewer blood blasts, lower marrow cellularity and a tendency towards older age. Of all patients treated with AML since January 1983, those with MD-AL were less likely to get a complete remission than those with other subtypes (35 vs 64%, p = 0.03). Treatment failure was usually due to resistant disease. Analysis of outcome as a function of drugs used during induction therapy showed an advantage for regimens containing vincristine and prednisone. The leukemic blast cells of nine patients were immunophenotyped for myeloid, lymphoid and megakaryoblast/platelet antigens. Although there were too few for a full statistical analysis as was applied to the larger group of 35 patients with MD-AL, these patients had a lower bone marrow cellularity as compared to FAB M1-M7 and a low remission rate.

Testicular relapse often develops in ALL of children after BMT. However, some reports, including this report, indicate that testicular relapse following BMT can also occur in adults, so that the incidence of testicular relapse could be reduced either by total body irradiation (TBI) or testicular irradiation before transplantation. Incidence of Ph-positive chromosome following BMT is a key to illuminate the mechanism of the Philadelphia chromosome.

In two patients with unclassified ALL, surface CD22 antigen was not expressed but cytoplasmic CD22 antigen was strongly expressed. Three out of 9 patients with common ALL were cytoplasmic mu-heavy chain-positive, so these patients were diagnosed as Pre-B ALL. In four out of 8 patients with T-ALL, CD3 antigen was not expressed on the cell surface membrane. However all of T-ALL patients excluding one non-tested patient were cytoplasmic CD3-positive. The cytoplasmic expression of myeloperoxidase antigen was detected in twenty out of 21 patients with acute non-lymphoblastic leukemia (ANLL). One megakaryocytic leukemia patient was MPO-negative.

A major characteristic of the s/l isolates in vitro is their inability to continuously replicate in cells of CD4+ established lines. In contrast, virus isolates designated rapid/high (r/h) obtained from patients in advanced stages of the HIV-infection do not show this restriction in replicative capacity. To analyze whether introduction of the tat protein into certain cell types or an over-expression of the tat protein would render cells permissive for s/l virus replication, the tat gene was transfected into cells of monocytoid and T cell origin. The resulting cell lines were then tested for their susceptibility to infection with s/l and r/h type HIV-1 isolates. The results conclusively show that mere constitutive expression of the tat protein in established CD4+ cell lines will not provide conditions allowing for continuous replication of s/l type virus. Thus, the Jurkat-tat cell line is a unique cell system for long-term propagation of this type of virus.

The derived values for SF2 (surviving fraction at 200 cGy) and alpha (initial slope of radiation survival curves constructed according to the linear quadratic model) indicated a marked interpatient heterogeneity in intrinsic radiation sensitivity of LPC populations. The SF2 values ranged from 0.01 to 1.00 (median = 0.430; mean +/- SE = 0.47 +/- 0.04), and the alpha values ranged from 0.000 to 3.272 Gy-1 (median = 0.280 Gy-1; mean +/- SE = 0.430 +/- 0.093 Gy-1). When CD19+ CD34+ versus CD19+ CD34- immunophenotypes were compared, a trend toward higher SF2 and lower alpha values were observed in LPC from CD34+ patients, consistent with greater radiation resistance. When patients were divided into three approximately equal groups based on increasing levels of CD34 expression, a clear ordering effect was observed indicating that increased CD34 expression levels are associated with significantly higher radiation resistance at the level of B-lineage LPC. The highest CD34 expression group (> or = 75% positivity) had 1.4-fold higher SF2 (P = 0.05) and twofold lower alpha values (P = 0.06) than the lowest group (< 30% positivity).

This effect is apparently due to salvage from the medium, by surviving leukaemic cells, of metabolites such as hypoxanthine and thymidine. In an attempt to address this problem, we have examined the effect, on leukaemic cell populations, of enzymatically depleting these metabolites from the culture medium employed during the MTT assay, using xanthine oxidase and thymidine phosphorylase. Specifically we have assessed methotrexate cytotoxicity in the paediatric acute lymphoblastic T cell leukaemia, GKTL, which is maintained as a xenograft, and like primary leukaemias, has poor viability in vitro. Although little cytotoxicity of GKTL cells was observed when the MTT assay was performed in supplemented RPMI-1640 medium, dose-dependent cytotoxicity of these cells was clearly apparent when the same medium was enzymatically depleted. In contrast, the ID50 for methotrexate of control CCRF-CEM cells was unaltered in enzymatically depleted medium. In the absence of methotrexate, enzymatic depletion of the medium did not affect leukaemic cell survival.

The previous identification of iron-responsive elements in the 5'-untranslated region of human and murine erythroid ALAS mRNA raised the intriguing possibility that eALAS expression might be under iron-dependent translational control. As a consequence, a single post-transcriptional regulatory system could coordinate cellular iron acquisition via the transferrin receptor, storage via ferritin, and utilization via eALAS. We directly demonstrate iron-dependent translational regulation of eALAS mRNA in murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells.

This inhibitory effect of 8-Cl-cAMP was related to its ability to differentially regulate type I versus type II cAMP-dependent protein kinase. In the present study we demonstrated a unique mechanism of action of 8-Cl-cAMP in the regulation of these kinase isozymes in HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemia cells. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) resolved various isoforms of protein kinase present in HL-60 cells. In control cells, type I protein kinase (PKI) comprised more than 90% and type II protein kinase (PKII) less than 10% of the total cAMP-stimulated kinase activity. Treatment with 8-Cl-cAMP (5 microM, 72 h) decreased PKI to a level below 30% of that in untreated control cells and markedly increased PKII composed of three peaks. Photoaffinity labeling/SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of column fractions identified the molecular species of regulatory (R) subunits present in protein kinases. Control cells contained high levels of the 48-kDa protein (RI) that composed PKI and low levels of the 50-kDa RII associated with PKII. 8-Cl-cAMP treatment brought about a decrease in the 48-kDa RI along with an increased formation of the truncated 34-kDa RI associated with PKI and an increase in the 50-54-kDa species of RII associated with PKII. A similar protein kinase profile as that shown by 8-Cl-cAMP treatment was observed in cells infected with the human RII beta retroviral vector: the 48-kDa RI of PKI decreased and the 52- and 54-kDa RII associated with PKII increased as compared with uninfected control cells. However, unlike 8-Cl-cAMP treatment, RII beta retroviral vector infection brought about no increase in the 34-kDa-truncated RI but exhibited an increase in the free 48-kDa RI subunit. As the 48-kDa RI and the 50-kDa RII were present in control cells, the enhanced expression of the 52- and 54-kDa RII proteins was due to overexpression of the RII beta gene. We identified the 48-kDa RI as RI alpha, the 50-kDa RII as RII alpha, the 52-kDa RII as RII beta, and the 54-kDa RII as the phosphorylated form of either the RII alpha or RII beta subunit. In vivo labeling experiments using [3H]8-Cl-cAMP demonstrated that 8-Cl-cAMP enters cells and binds to both PKI and PKII.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Rohlff, C', 'Clair, T', 'Cho-Chung, Y S']","['Rohlff C', 'Clair T', 'Cho-Chung YS']","['Cellular Biochemistry Section, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '23583-48-4 (8-Bromo Cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate)', 'BQ94Z7E5OR (8-chloro-cyclic adenosine monophosphate)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['8-Bromo Cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', '*Cell Differentiation/drug effects', '*Cell Division/drug effects', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Down-Regulation', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Up-Regulation']",1993/03/15 00:00,1993/03/15 00:01,['1993/03/15 00:00'],"['1993/03/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/03/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/03/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(18)53386-X [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1993 Mar 15;268(8):5774-82.,,,,,,,,,,

Recent evidence suggested that gp55 binds to erythropoietin receptors (EpoR) in the RER, and it was proposed that this intracellular interaction causes mitogenesis (Li, J.-P., D'Andrea, A. D., Lodish, H. F., and Baltimore, D. (1990) Nature 343, 762-764). Other evidence has indicated that the plasma membrane component (gp55P) can also complex with EpoR. To identify the site of functional complexes and to study the factors that control their formation, we analyzed eight SFFV env mutants that contain in-frame deletions or linker insertions. The three nonpathogenic mutants encode gp55s that fail to leave the RER, whereas the five pathogenic mutants encode glycoproteins that occur on cell surfaces. Although BaF3 hematopoietic cells are interleukin 3 (IL-3)-dependent, a cellular derivative BaF3/EpoR that contains EpoR survives and grows in either IL-3 or erythropoietin (Epo). The five pathogenic SFFV env mutants converted BaF3/EpoR but not BaF3 cells to growth factor independence, whereas the nonpathogenic mutants did not eliminate growth factor requirements of any cells. Studies using 125I-Epo and the covalent cross-linking reagent disuccinimidyl suberate provided unambiguous evidence for ternary complexes of 125I-Epo.EpoR.gp55P on surfaces of all factor-independent cells. Size of the cell surface complex was correspondingly reduced in the case of a newly isolated SFFV mutant that encodes a severely truncated (M(r) approximately 41,000) but mitogenically active env glycoprotein. Our results support the hypothesis that activation of EpoR by the SFFV env glycoprotein occurs exclusively on cell surfaces.","['Ferro, F E Jr', 'Kozak, S L', 'Hoatlin, M E', 'Kabat, D']","['Ferro FE Jr', 'Kozak SL', 'Hoatlin ME', 'Kabat D']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, School of Medicine, Oregon Health Sciences University, Portland 97201-3098.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Mitogens)', '0 (Receptors, Erythropoietin)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (glycoprotein gp55, Friend spleen focus-forming virus)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/genetics/pathogenicity', 'Genes, Viral', 'Genes, env', 'Mice', 'Mitogens/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Receptors, Erythropoietin/*metabolism', 'Spleen Focus-Forming Viruses/*genetics/physiology', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Virion']",1993/03/15 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1993/03/15 00:00'],"['1993/03/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1993/03/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(18)53381-0 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1993 Mar 15;268(8):5741-7.,,,['env'],,,,,"['CA25810/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA54149/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,

Growth factors have the potential to reduce the morbidity and mortality of both induction and postremission therapy by enhancing hematopoietic recovery or, when used as an adjunct to standard antimicrobial therapy, reducing the infectious complications of chemotherapy. In addition, they may have favorable effects on the biology of leukemia either by recruitment of leukemic progenitors into cycle, rendering them more sensitive to the cytotoxic effects of chemotherapy, or by inducing the terminal differentiation of the leukemic clone. Finally, disruption of aberrant growth factor networks, thought to play a role in the pathogenesis of leukemia, may be a therapeutic strategy now that soluble receptors and receptor antagonists to such growth factors as IL-1 are available. Whether growth factors used in such ways will have beneficial, or in fact adverse, effects on the treatment outcome for acute leukemia is not yet known. As such, the use of growth factors in the management of adults with acute leukemia is still experimental and needs to be studied in the context of clinical trials. Perhaps the ultimate benefit to be derived from the study of these growth factors will be a deeper understanding of the genetic perturbations that define the leukemic state. The development of molecular therapeutic techniques, such as gene transfer technology and the use of antisense oligonucleotides, has paralleled our increasing knowledge of cytokines. The hope is that as we come to understand leukemia at the molecular level, we will be able to develop the new therapeutic tools necessary to increase the numbers of patients cured.","['Bernstein, S H']",['Bernstein SH'],"['Department of Medicine, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, New York.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Hematol Oncol Clin North Am,Hematology/oncology clinics of North America,8709473,"['0 (Adjuvants, Immunologic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)', '0 (Immunologic Factors)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adjuvants, Immunologic/therapeutic use', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects', 'Bone Marrow Diseases/chemically induced/therapy', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Cytarabine/pharmacokinetics', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Growth Substances/*therapeutic use', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/therapeutic use', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Factors/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*therapy', 'Middle Aged']",1993/02/01 00:00,1993/02/01 00:01,['1993/02/01 00:00'],"['1993/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Hematol Oncol Clin North Am. 1993 Feb;7(1):255-74.,74,,,,,,,,,

It is apparent from data around the world that ABMT is a curative therapy for patients with both AML and ALL after primary treatment failure. Other than allogeneic BMT, ABMT may be the only curative therapy following relapse, especially in AML. The role of ABMT in first CR is less well defined. There are few data to support the widespread use of ABMT in first CR for ALL. Moreover, the improved survival of adults with ALL with current intense multiagent regimens will probably obviate the need to continue clinical trials of ABMT for ALL in first CR. For patients with AML in first CR, however, it seems that ABMT may well lead to improved rates of DFS compared with chemotherapy alone. Almost every published report describes better DFS for patients who underwent ABMT compared with historical or contemporary controls who were treated with chemotherapy. One note of caution is that as chemotherapy evolves, the increment in survival currently observed from ABMT may diminish, thus rendering ABMT less obviously necessary. On the other hand, from an economic standpoint, ABMT could prove to be cost-effective, because a short, intense treatment that is effective may prove to be less costly than the current extended period of chemotherapy. Because ABMT is becoming safer, it would seem reasonable to continue its use in patients with AML at high risk for relapse (secondary AML, adverse cytogenetics, and so on) while awaiting the outcome of the randomized clinical trials currently underway that are seeking to define the role of ABMT for the general population of patients with AML after initial remission is achieved. Meanwhile, further definition of the relative value of the various purging regimens, preparative regimens, and adjunctive therapy (i.e., IL-2, mAb) warrants study.","['Ball, E D', 'Rybka, W B']","['Ball ED', 'Rybka WB']","['Division of Hematology/Bone Marrow Transplantation, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Pennsylvania.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Hematol Oncol Clin North Am,Hematology/oncology clinics of North America,8709473,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Purging/methods', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/mortality/pathology/*surgery/therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Remission Induction', 'Salvage Therapy', 'Survival Rate', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",1993/02/01 00:00,1993/02/01 00:01,['1993/02/01 00:00'],"['1993/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Hematol Oncol Clin North Am. 1993 Feb;7(1):201-31.,113,,,,,,,,,

Effect of metal salts, organometals, and metalloporphyrins on heme synthesis and catabolism, with special reference to clinical implications and interactions with cytochrome P-450.",49-152,"Although free porphyrins occur in nature in small quantities, no known function has been assigned to them. In contrast, heme and cobalamin, which are Fe and Co chelates of porphyrins or porphyrin derivatives, respectively, carry out crucial biological functions. Heme is the prosthetic group for a number of hemoproteins. These include myoglobin and hemoglobin, which carry out oxygen binding or transport; mitochondrial cytochromes aa3, b, c, and c3, which are important in transferring electrons; microsomal cytochrome P-450, which catalyzes mixed-function oxidations; catalase, which decomposes H2O2; peroxidase, which activates H2O2; and tryptophan pyrrolase, which catalyzes the oxidation of tryptophan. Recently, heme has also been shown to be the prosthetic group of prostaglandin and peroxide synthetase and indoleamine dioxygenase. The elegant studies of the biochemical pathway for the formation of heme demonstrated the arrangement in the porphyrin macrocycle of the carbon and nitrogen atoms originating from the eight glycine and the succinic acid molecule that are the precursors of porphyrins. There are eight enzymes involved in the synthesis of heme. The first and last three of these enzymes are localized in mitochondria, while the intermediate enzymes are localized in cytosol. The catalytic site of HMOX recognizes metalloporphyrins with central metal atoms other than iron; it favors some of these metalloporphyrins over heme as a potential substrate, sometimes by a large factor, permitting the synthetic heme analogue to serve as a potent competitive inhibitor of HMOX reaction. Since these synthetic metalloporphyrins do not bind molecular oxygen, they are not metabolically degraded by ring rupture and do not add to the body pool of bile pigment. One possible consequence of this competitive inhibition of heme degradation is suppression of bile pigment formation to such a degree that excessive plasma levels of bilirubin may be diminished. The studies of Drummond and Kappas (1981) and later studies in rats, mice, monkeys, and man, and also our studies have proved the latter phenomenon. The compound does not appear to affect the metabolic disposition of preformed bilirubin but inhibits biliary bilirubin excretion derived from the metabolism of endogenous or exogenous heme. Whether some of the effect of Sn-PP on naturally occurring or experimentally induced jaundice in animals reflects diversion of heme to nonheme to oxygenase-dependent pathways of heme metabolism, or whether a pathway which is normally latent becomes activated concurrent with HMOX inhibition is not known.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Beri, R', 'Chandra, R']","['Beri R', 'Chandra R']","['Department of Chemistry, University of Delhi, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Drug Metab Rev,Drug metabolism reviews,0322067,"['0 (Metalloporphyrins)', '0 (Metals)', '0 (Organometallic Compounds)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', '42VZT0U6YR (Heme)', '9035-51-2 (Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Metabolism, Inborn Errors/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Catalysis', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Drug Interactions', 'Heme/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hyperbilirubinemia/prevention & control', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Lead Poisoning/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/metabolism', 'Metalloporphyrins/*pharmacology', 'Metals/*pharmacology', 'Organometallic Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Tyrosine']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/03602539308993973 [doi]'],ppublish,Drug Metab Rev. 1993;25(1-2):49-152. doi: 10.3109/03602539308993973.,477,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: A 6-week-old, phenotypically normal boy first was seen in 1979 with hepatosplenomegaly, a 36 x 10(9)/l leukocyte count, a leukoerythroblastic picture, and increased blasts in the bone marrow aspirate. Because no other known causes of leukemoid reaction could be demonstrated, the picture was consistent at that time with acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL), French-American-British (FAB) M1; however, because of the age of the child, the low blast count, normal cytogenetics, and questions about this diagnosis, treatment was withheld. Hematologic laboratory values normalized by the time he was 1 year of age. Eleven years later, he presented a similar picture that rapidly progressed to overt leukemia (FAB M1). A normal marrow karyotype was consistent throughout the 11 years of follow-up. Treatment of ANLL was initiated, resulting in marrow remission. This was followed by allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. He had a relapse again and was retreated, achieving a second marrow remission, and had a second allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. However, the patient died of venoocclusive disease of the liver after the second transplant. CONCLUSION: The diagnosis and prognosis of infants with an abnormal hematologic picture similar to ANLL but who are phenotypically and karyotypically normal are not as straightforward as in the older child or adult.

Histologic and clinical features of advanced-stage disease. The Cancer and Leukemia Group B.,1857-66,"BACKGROUND: This article reviews the salient pathologic and clinical features of 171 patients with Stage III-IV disease who were 60 years of age or older who were treated on four Hodgkin disease (HD) protocols from 1969 to 1988. METHODS: Pretherapy sections were reviewed centrally for correlation of the histologic classification with anatomic sites of involvement and survival. RESULTS: The diagnosis of HD was confirmed in 114 (66.7%) patients. Non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL) and a miscellaneous non-HD group accounted for 52 (30.4%) and 5 (2.9%) of the cases. The overall median survival times of patients with Stage III-IV HD and NHL who were 60 years of age or older in the four protocols were not significantly different (1.5 versus 1.3 years, respectively; P = 0.28). There also was no significant correlation between the survival of these patients with HD and either the Rye classification, 19 specific histologic parameters, or the British National Lymphoma Investigation grading system for HDNS. In the last protocol, the 5-year survival rate of patients with HD who were 60 years of age or older was lower than that of patients 40-59 years of age or that of those younger than 40 years of age (31% versus 63% versus 79%, respectively, P < 0.0001). Patients with HD entered into the two most recent protocols showed lower incidences of involvement of cervical and iliac-inguinal-femoral lymph nodes and skin-subcutaneous tissues than the patients with NHL who were misdiagnosed as HD. Moreover, patients with Stage III-IV HD in the most recent protocol who were 60 years of age or older had lower rates of involvement of the cervical and mediastinal-hilar lymph nodes and a higher rate of involvement of the gastrointestinal tract than younger patients. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with Stage III-IV HD and NHL who are 60 years of age or older differ with respect to the rates of involvement of specific anatomic sites but not in survival when treated with HD protocols. In contrast, patients of different age groups with Stage III-IV HD disease differ with regard to the rates of involvement of anatomic sites and survival.","['Mir, R', 'Anderson, J', 'Strauchen, J', 'Nissen, N I', 'Cooper, M R', 'Rafla, S', 'Canellos, G P', 'Bloomfield, C D', 'Gottlieb, A J', 'Peterson, B']","['Mir R', 'Anderson J', 'Strauchen J', 'Nissen NI', 'Cooper MR', 'Rafla S', 'Canellos GP', 'Bloomfield CD', 'Gottlieb AJ', 'Peterson B', 'et al.']","['Long Island Jewish Medical Center, New Hyde Park, New York.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Hodgkin Disease/mortality/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Survival Analysis']",1993/03/01 00:00,1993/03/01 00:01,['1993/03/01 00:00'],"['1993/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19930301)71:5<1857::aid-cncr2820710524>3.0.co;2-b [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1993 Mar 1;71(5):1857-66. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19930301)71:5<1857::aid-cncr2820710524>3.0.co;2-b.,,,,,,,,"['CA-03927/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-04457/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-11028/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,

RESULTS: After treatment with MOPLEC, there were 16 complete responders (44%) and 18 partial responders (50%). One patient had progressive disease and one patient was taken off study after an anaphylactic reaction to etoposide. After completing the entire protocol, 32 patients achieved complete remission (CR) (89%) and 3 achieved partial remission (PR) (8%). Five CR patients have relapsed and three additional patients have died in CR without recurrence. At 36 months, the estimated failure-free survival is 61% and overall survival is 72%. CONCLUSIONS: This combination, which includes etoposide, is active for the primary treatment of advanced Hodgkin disease.","['Kirshner, J J', 'Anderson, J R', 'Parker, B', 'Barcos, M', 'Cooper, M R', 'Burns, L J', 'Peterson, B A', 'Gottlieb, A J']","['Kirshner JJ', 'Anderson JR', 'Parker B', 'Barcos M', 'Cooper MR', 'Burns LJ', 'Peterson BA', 'Gottlieb AJ']",['S.U.N.Y.

The molecules, which are recognized by NK cells, have not yet been identified, but there is ample evidence that target cell surface glycoconjugates are involved in the interaction with NK cells. In this report, we show that the recognition of K562 target cells by human NK cells depends on the presence of protein-bound determinants, implying that glycolipids are not the primary target structures on K562 cells. The NK susceptibility of K562 cells was not altered by enzymic removal of various cell surface carbohydrates or oligosaccharides, mostly related to N-linked carbohydrate chains. Treatment of K562 cells with 1-deoxynojirimycin and 1-deoxymannojirimycin, inhibitors of N-glycan processing, resulted in drastic alterations in the carbohydrate phenotype of the cell surface, as could be shown by flow cytometric analysis of the lectin-binding properties of the cells. Despite these clear changes in N-glycosylation, the NK susceptibility of K562 cells remained unaffected. Summarizing, the results described in this report show that potential target structures for NK cells are protein bound, but the involvement of a specific (N-linked) carbohydrate determinant in the interaction between NK cells and target cells could not be established.","['Voshol, H', 'Dullens, H F', 'Den Otter, W', 'Vliegenthart, J F']","['Voshol H', 'Dullens HF', 'Den Otter W', 'Vliegenthart JF']","['Utrecht University, Bijvoet Center, Department of Bio-Organic Chemistry, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Glycobiology,Glycobiology,9104124,"['0 (Carbohydrates)', '0 (Glycoconjugates)', '0 (Glycolipids)', '0 (Lectins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Sialic Acids)', '19130-96-2 (1-Deoxynojirimycin)', 'EC 3.2.1.18 (Neuraminidase)', 'EC 3.4.21.4 (Trypsin)', 'GZP2782OP0 (N-Acetylneuraminic Acid)']",IM,"['1-Deoxynojirimycin/pharmacology', 'Carbohydrate Conformation', '*Carbohydrate Metabolism', 'Carbohydrates/chemistry', 'Cell Membrane/*chemistry', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Glycoconjugates/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Glycolipids/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Glycosylation', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*physiology', 'Lectins/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism', 'N-Acetylneuraminic Acid', 'Neoplasms/chemistry', 'Neuraminidase/pharmacology', 'Sialic Acids/metabolism', 'Trypsin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/02/01 00:00,1993/02/01 00:01,['1993/02/01 00:00'],"['1993/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/glycob/3.1.69 [doi]'],ppublish,Glycobiology. 1993 Feb;3(1):69-76. doi: 10.1093/glycob/3.1.69.,,,,,,,,,,

A positive correlation existed between hydrophobicities and activities of the toxins to inhibit PKC activity (assayed using phosphatidylserine vesicle, arachidonate monomer, and Triton/phosphatidylserine mixed micelle systems), phorbol ester binding to PKC, proliferation of several cancer cell lines, and phorbol ester-induced HL60 cell differentiation. Their relative hydrophobicities and activities, in a decreasing order, were cardiotoxin-1 approximately cardiotoxin-3 > cardiotoxin (a mixture of isoforms) > cardiotoxin-4 >> neurotoxin (inactive). Under the mixed micelle assay system (containing 0.3% Triton X-100, 8 mol % phosphatidylserine, 2 mol % diolein, and 200 microM CaCl2), cardiotoxin inhibited PKC competitively with respect to phosphatidylserine (apparent Ki of about 0.06 mol % or 2.5 microM), and in a mixed-type manner with respect to both diolein (apparent Ki of about 0.04 mol % or 1.7 microM) and Ca2+ (apparent Ki of about 2.9 microM). On the basis of findings that IC50 (approximately 0.3 microM) of cardiotoxin for inhibition of HL60 cell proliferation and differentiation was lower than its IC50 (9 microM) for PKC inhibition in vitro in the phosphatidylserine vesicle system and that PKC inhibition was the only known molecular mechanism of cardiotoxin, it was suggested that cardiotoxin might be highly membrane interacting and that the observed cellular effects of cardiotoxin might be mediated, in part, via PKC inhibition.","['Chiou, S H', 'Raynor, R L', 'Zheng, B', 'Chambers, T C', 'Kuo, J F']","['Chiou SH', 'Raynor RL', 'Zheng B', 'Chambers TC', 'Kuo JF']","['Institute of Biochemical Sciences, National Taiwan University, Taipei.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,"['0 (Cytotoxins)', '0 (Elapid Venoms)', '0 (Neurotoxins)', '37558-16-0 (Phorbol 12,13-Dibutyrate)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Brain/enzymology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/*drug effects', 'Cytotoxins/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Elapid Venoms/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neurotoxins/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Phorbol 12,13-Dibutyrate/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Swine', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/03/02 00:00,1993/03/02 00:01,['1993/03/02 00:00'],"['1993/03/02 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/03/02 00:01 [medline]', '1993/03/02 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/bi00059a025 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochemistry. 1993 Mar 2;32(8):2062-7. doi: 10.1021/bi00059a025.,,,,,,,,"['CA-36777/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-15696/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,

The release of Ca2+ from permeabilized cells in response to the second messenger inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) proceeds in this fashion. The mechanisms leading to quantal Ca2+ release are unknown. InsP3 releases 50-90% of the Ca2+ sequestered within the intracellular stores of mammalian cells permeabilized with saponin. However, preparation of microsomes results in the loss of this sensitivity. In this report, functionally intact intracellular Ca2+ stores were isolated from rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) cells by osmotic lysis followed by differential and sucrose density gradient centrifugation. From this preparation, 64% of the stored Ca2+ is released by InsP3. We demonstrate that quantal Ca2+ release is retained by isolated Ca2+ stores and is identical to that observed in permeabilized cells. Addition of a subsaturating (28 nM) concentration of InsP3 to permeabilized cells at 37 degrees C results in the release of only a small fraction of the sequestered Ca2+. When the cells are cooled to 11 degrees C, the remaining Ca2+ is rapidly released. Hence, the mechanism leading to the quantal nature of Ca2+ release is reversible and is thus not likely to be the result of a covalent modification of the channel protein or of the Ca2+ store.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Kindman, L A', 'Meyer, T']","['Kindman LA', 'Meyer T']","['Department of Cell Biology, Stanford University Medical Center, California 94305.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '37H9VM9WZL (Calcimycin)', '85166-31-0 (Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate)', 'EC 1.1.1.27 (L-Lactate Dehydrogenase)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Calcimycin/pharmacology', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Computer Simulation', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate/analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology/*physiology', 'Kinetics', 'L-Lactate Dehydrogenase/analysis', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Microsomes/drug effects/metabolism', 'Quantum Theory', 'Rats', 'Second Messenger Systems', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Subcellular Fractions/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/02/09 00:00,1993/02/09 00:01,['1993/02/09 00:00'],"['1993/02/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/02/09 00:01 [medline]', '1993/02/09 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/bi00056a011 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochemistry. 1993 Feb 9;32(5):1270-7. doi: 10.1021/bi00056a011.,,,,,,,,"['1K11 HL02361/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM 24032/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'MH 45324/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States']",,

With improved long-term survivals, increases in observed second malignancies over those of the general population have been reported as early as 1972. Recently, a number of investigators have suggested that the relative importance of recognized risk factors contributing to the development of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, and solid tumors may be different. Our study is concerned with the influence of various risk factors on patients who have been treated with modern radiotherapy and combination chemotherapy between 1966 and 1987. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We reviewed the records of 1,022 patients with Hodgkin's disease of whom 1,013 had sufficient data for analysis. Kaplan-Meier methodology was used to calculate overall and determinate survivals and occurrences of acute myelogenous leukemia, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and solid tumors. The observed to expected incidences, calculated from the SEER incidence and population files for 1976, were compared. Using Cox's proportional hazards model, the following were analyzed singly for risk significance for the entire population: age, stage, splenectomy, treatment modality, treatment intensity, and number of treated relapses. Separate analyses were performed to determine the relative risks for subsets of the population. These included pelvic radiotherapy for those with stage III disease and specific alkylating agents for patients who were treated with chemotherapy only. RESULTS: Sixty-six instances of second malignancy were documented as follows: AML 14, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma 14, and solid tumors 38. The overall incidence of second malignancy was significantly greater than the expected incidence of 21.75 (p = 0.0001) and it was also significant for AML, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and solid tumors. Analyses for risk of second malignancy demonstrated that age > or = 40 years, stage III or stage IV disease, and treatment with chemotherapy only were all associated with a significantly higher risk of second malignancy than any of the other factors. However, only treatment with regimens containing nitrogen mustard had a significantly higher risk for second malignancy. Treatment intensity and number of treated relapses had no specific effect on risk. Joint modeling of age, stage, and treatment showed that the combination of age and stage was the most significant risk factor for AML and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (p = < 0.0003). However, only age was important for solid tumors. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis suggests that the most critical host factor for developing a second malignancy was age. The fact that patients with stages III and IV disease had an increased risk of second malignancy regardless of age suggests that biologic factors related to the tumor also may have been significant. However, it is possible that the effect of treatment was hidden by stage.","['Rodriguez, M A', 'Fuller, L M', 'Zimmerman, S O', 'Allen, P K', 'Brown, B W', 'Munsell, M F', 'Hagemeister, F B', 'McLaughlin, P', 'Velasquez, W S', 'Swan, F Jr']","['Rodriguez MA', 'Fuller LM', 'Zimmerman SO', 'Allen PK', 'Brown BW', 'Munsell MF', 'Hagemeister FB', 'McLaughlin P', 'Velasquez WS', 'Swan F Jr', 'et al.']","['Department of Hematology, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Ann Oncol,Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,9007735,,IM,"['Actuarial Analysis', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hodgkin Disease/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology/*radiotherapy', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*epidemiology', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*epidemiology', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Risk Factors', 'Skin Neoplasms/epidemiology']",1993/02/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1993/02/01 00:00'],"['1993/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1993/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1093/oxfordjournals.annonc.a058414 [doi]', 'S0923-7534(19)64682-X [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Oncol. 1993 Feb;4(2):125-31. doi: 10.1093/oxfordjournals.annonc.a058414.,,,,,,,,,,

CONCLUSIONS: The risk of secondary AML possibly related to the use of VP-16 given twice weekly.","['Sugita, K', 'Furukawa, T', 'Tsuchida, M', 'Okawa, Y', 'Nakazawa, S', 'Akatsuka, J', 'Ohira, M', 'Nishimura, K']","['Sugita K', 'Furukawa T', 'Tsuchida M', 'Okawa Y', 'Nakazawa S', 'Akatsuka J', 'Ohira M', 'Nishimura K']","['Second Department of Pediatrics, School of Medicine, Dokkyo University, Tochigi-ken, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Am J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,The American journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,7908071,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '7006-34-0 (Asparagine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)', 'B-8801 protocol', 'T-8801 protocol']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Asparagine/administration & dosage', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11/ultrastructure', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/*chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Life Tables', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/administration & dosage', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Risk', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",1993/02/01 00:00,1993/02/01 00:01,['1993/02/01 00:00'],"['1993/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00043426-199302000-00013 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 1993 Feb;15(1):99-104. doi: 10.1097/00043426-199302000-00013.,,,,['Am J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 1994 Nov;16(4):384-6.

DESIGN: Relevant studies on the clinical pharmacology of 6MP were reviewed. RESULTS: 6MP is one of the major drugs used in maintenance therapy of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). It is also used to treat steroid unresponsive inflammatory bowel disease. 6MP is an inactive prodrug that requires absorption, cellular uptake, and intracellular anabolism to nucleotides for cytotoxic activity. These nucleotides are ultimately incorporated into DNA and RNA, resulting in cell death. Two analogs of 6MP, azathioprine and 6-thioguanine, are also anabolized to the same intracellular metabolites, suggesting they should be therapeutically equivalent to 6MP. 6MP may be anabolized to nonmethylated nucleotides or may undergo methylation by the enzyme thiopurine methyltransferase to S-methylated nucleotides, which are also cytotoxic. CONCLUSION: Recent studies of 6MP pharmacokinetics in children with ALL have suggested that a higher systemic exposure, as measured by a greater area under the plasma concentration time curve or a higher concentration of 6MP metabolites in red blood cells, is associated with a decreased risk of relapse.","['Bostrom, B', 'Erdmann, G']","['Bostrom B', 'Erdmann G']","[""Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Minneapolis Children's Medical Center, MN.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Am J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,The American journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,7908071,"['0 (Nucleic Acids)', '0 (Prodrugs)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.67 (thiopurine methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Biological Availability', 'Biotransformation', 'Child', 'Circadian Rhythm', 'Erythrocytes/metabolism', 'Half-Life', 'Humans', 'Leukocytes/metabolism', 'Mercaptopurine/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Methylation', 'Methyltransferases/genetics/metabolism', 'Nucleic Acids/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Prodrugs/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome']",1993/02/01 00:00,1993/02/01 00:01,['1993/02/01 00:00'],"['1993/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Am J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 1993 Feb;15(1):80-6.,38,,,,,,,,,

The validity of the current method was demonstrated by the good concordance of the findings with previously published data as follows: (1) practically identical results were obtained when an established method for cell permeabilization was used in parallel on the same samples; (2) the proportion of TdT-positive cells in normal peripheral blood was negligible; (3) the proportion of TdT-positive cells in normal bone marrow averaged 1%, and a significant portion of TdT-positive cells in normal bone marrow expressed CD10 and CD34; and (4) TdT-positive cell populations were seen with the expected frequencies in various types of leukemia. This method for TdT flow cytometry provides significant advantages over previously used methods and is especially suitable for TdT detection in routine laboratories.","['Syrjala, M T', 'Tiirikainen, M', 'Jansson, S E', 'Krusius, T']","['Syrjala MT', 'Tiirikainen M', 'Jansson SE', 'Krusius T']","['Department of Clinical Chemistry, Helsinki University, Finland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,"['0 (Antigens)', 'EC 2.7.7.31 (DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase)']",IM,"['Antigens/analysis', 'Bone Marrow/enzymology/immunology', 'Cell Membrane Permeability/immunology', 'DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase/immunology/*metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', 'Hematologic Diseases/*enzymology/immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*enzymology/immunology', 'Leukocytes/enzymology/immunology']",1993/03/01 00:00,1993/03/01 00:01,['1993/03/01 00:00'],"['1993/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/ajcp/99.3.298 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Clin Pathol. 1993 Mar;99(3):298-303. doi: 10.1093/ajcp/99.3.298.,,,,,,,,,,

The molecular mass of the pure polypeptide was consistent with an 18-kDa polypeptide from THP-1 cell membranes that was specifically photolabeled by an LTC4 photoaffinity probe, 125I-labeled azido-LTC4. On calibrated gel-filtration columns, purified LTC4 synthase activity eluted at a volume corresponding to 39.2 +/- 3.3 kDa (n = 12). The sequence of the N-terminal 35 amino acids was determined and found to be a unique sequence composed predominantly of hydrophobic amino acids and containing a consensus sequence for protein kinase C phosphorylation.

In permeabilized cells supplemented with cytosolic proteins and an ATP-generating system, 20-50% of the radiolabeled precursor glycophorins can be converted to the mature, sialylated form. This maturation process is ATP- and cytosol-dependent and is blocked by guanosine 5'-[gamma-thio]triphosphate (GTP[gamma S]). Electron microscopy of permeabilized MEL cells shows retention of ER elements, stacked Golgi cisternae, free polysomes, and other subcellular components. In the presence of GTP[gamma S], dilated vesicles accumulate around the Golgi stacks. Antisera to the carboxyl terminus of the Golgi resident alpha subunit of Gi3 inhibit maturation of glycophorin. To our knowledge, a transport assay utilizing O-glycosylation of an endogenous protein as a monitor of ER-through-Golgi traffic in permeabilized cells has not been reported previously. Furthermore, the data provide evidence for heterotrimeric GTP-binding protein involvement in Golgi function.","['Wilson, B S', 'Palade, G E', 'Farquhar, M G']","['Wilson BS', 'Palade GE', 'Farquhar MG']","['Division of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla 92093.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Glycophorins)', '0 (Streptolysins)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Biological Transport', 'Cell Membrane Permeability', 'Cytoskeleton/metabolism', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum/*metabolism', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Glycophorins/*metabolism', 'Glycosylation', 'Golgi Apparatus/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Mice', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Streptolysins/chemistry', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/03/01 00:00,1993/03/01 00:01,['1993/03/01 00:00'],"['1993/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.90.5.1681 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1993 Mar 1;90(5):1681-5. doi: 10.1073/pnas.90.5.1681.,,,,,PMC45943,,,"['CA46128/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK17780/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,

The purpose of this report is to summarize the influence of corn oil gavage and different nonpurified diets on spontaneous tumor incidences in 64 diet and 59 corn oil gavage control groups in two-year studies involving approximately 6,100 control Fischer 344 rats of each sex. The maximum mean body weight attained during the course of the study, survival at 106 weeks of age, and spontaneous tumor incidences of groups fed different nonpurified diets with or without corn oil gavage were summarized and evaluated for differences. Male rats fed NIH-07 open-formula diet with or without corn oil gavage had significantly higher body weight, lower survival, and higher incidence of pancreatic acinar cell tumors than rats fed commercial proprietary diets with or without corn oil gavage. Female rats fed NIH-07 diet with or without corn oil gavage had significantly higher body weights and pancreatic tumor incidences than groups fed commercial diets. Time-related trends could account for other apparent differences in tumor incidences between the groups fed commercial and NIH-07 diets. Corn oil gavage significantly increased the body weight and pancreatic tumor incidences but decreased the incidence of leukemia, a lethal tumor, which resulted in higher survival in male rats. Corn oil gavage significantly lowered the body weight and anterior pituitary tumor incidence in female rats. The pancreatic acinar cell tumor incidence appears to be due to a combination of fat intake and body weight.","['Rao, G N', 'Haseman, J K']","['Rao GN', 'Haseman JK']","['National Toxicology Program, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, Research Triangle Park, NC 27709.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Nutr Cancer,Nutrition and cancer,7905040,"['0 (Dietary Fats)', '8001-30-7 (Corn Oil)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Body Weight', 'Corn Oil/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Dietary Fats/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Food, Formulated/*adverse effects', 'Leukemia, Experimental/etiology', 'Male', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*etiology', 'Pancreatic Neoplasms/etiology', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred F344', 'Sex Characteristics', 'Survival Rate']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/01635589309514233 [doi]'],ppublish,Nutr Cancer. 1993;19(1):21-30. doi: 10.1080/01635589309514233.,,,,,,,,,,

This effect was detectable after 2 days and expression was maximal at 5 days. Similar results were obtained during treatment with cis-retinoic acid (CRA), hexamethylene bisacetamide (HMBA), or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). The results also demonstrate that ATRA-induced c-fms expression is potentiated by exposure to tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) or dibutyryl cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). The induction of c-fms transcripts by ATRA is associated with induction of M-CSF-binding ability, suggesting cell surface expression of the monocyte growth factor receptor.

Here we report that such an event is associated with an overexpression of the erythroid-specific transcription factors GATA-1 and NFE-2. Using the electrophoretic mobility shift assay, during differentiation over 3 days of culture, we have observed an increase in the binding either of GATA-1 to the promoter of the gamma-globin gene (region -201 to -156) or NFE-2 to the promotor of the porphobilinogen deaminase gene (region -170 to -142). Both events were paralleled by a recruitment of hemoglobinized cells and a stimulation of heme synthesis. Enhanced binding capacity of GATA-1 was confirmed by an increase in its mRNAs. Moreover, GATA-1 and NFE-2 overexpression has been shown to be specific of the differentiating effect of the drug and not of its growth inhibitory effect. In contrast, no change was observed in the binding of the ubiquitous factors OTF-1 and AP-1, except on day 3, where AP-1 decreased. Although ACM is a DNA-intercalating agent, it did not directly affect transcription factors binding to their cis-sequences as assessed by the preincubation of the oligonucleotides probes with increasing concentrations of ACM.

The p75 IL-2R beta transcripts were detected in all cases, whereas the membrane p75 molecule was demonstrable by flow cytometry in three cases. However, data from the immunoprecipitation analysis suggest that the lack of the p75 IL-2R detection by flow cytometry might be caused by the low density of molecules per cell rather than the fact that the specific mRNA is not translated into the p75 surface molecule.

None of the cytokines tested affected the sensitivity of these targets to natural killer activity. In contrast, specific cytokines, different for each cell line, enhanced the susceptibility to lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells, while interferon gamma (IFN)-gamma always induced resistance. The same cytokines that increased LAK susceptibility also induced proliferative responses. The TALL-101 cell line, which responded to granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) with increased susceptibility to lysis, and to IFN-gamma with resistance, was used as a model to analyze the mechanisms underlying these changes. Cold target inhibition and conjugate formation assays both indicated that the changes in LAK susceptibility were not at the level of effector-target (E/T) binding. Furthermore, no significant changes in surface expression of adhesion molecules involved in E/T binding were induced by either GM-CSF or IFN-gamma on TALL-101 cells. Finally, N-alpha-benzyloxycarbonyl-L-lysine thiobenzyl-esterase assays demonstrated no differences in the ability of these cytokines to trigger the secretion of cytolysins in the bound effectors compared to unstimulated cells. Taken together, these results suggest that the cytokine-modulated susceptibility to lysis of these T-ALL lines might occur at a post-binding stage with mechanisms involving an altered responsiveness to lytic factors.","['Cesano, A', 'Clark, S C', 'Santoli, D']","['Cesano A', 'Clark SC', 'Santoli D']","['Wistar Institute of Anatomy and Biology, Philadelphia, PA 19104.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",IM,"['Cell Division/drug effects', 'Child', 'Cytokines/*pharmacology', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte/genetics', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Lymphokine-Activated/*drug effects/*physiology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*drug therapy/*immunology/pathology', 'Phenotype', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1993/03/01 00:00,1993/03/01 00:01,['1993/03/01 00:00'],"['1993/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1993 Mar;7(3):404-9.,,,,,,,,"['CA-10815/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-47589/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,

In 84 children with ALL at initial diagnosis we studied the correlation between these factors and the in vitro resistance to eight drugs, determined with the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl-2, 5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. B-lineage ALL samples were classified into four differentiation stages: the CD10- proB ALL; cALL; preB ALL with cytoplasmic mu positive ALL cells; and B-ALL with surface immunoglobulin-positive (Ig+) cells. cALL and preB ALL cases have the best prognosis; proB and T-ALL cases show a worse prognosis and B-ALL the poorest prognosis. Patients aged < 18 months and > 10 years have a poor prognosis compared to patients in the intermediate age group. Our results show that cALL and preB ALL cells were the most drug-sensitive cells compared to the other phenotypes. No differences were found between cALL and preB ALL cases with the exception that preB cells were more sensitive to mustine and mafosfamide (Maf). Compared to cALL and preB ALL cases, T-ALL cases were significantly more resistant to prednisolone (Pred), daunorubicin (DNR), L-asparaginase (L-Asp), cytosine arabinoside (AraC), and Maf; proB ALL cases were more resistant to Pred, DNR, L-Asp, and 6-thioguanine. The three B-ALL cases were resistant to vincristine and DNR. Two out of three B-ALL were resistant to Pred. Compared to cells from patients aged 18 months to 10 years, cells from children < 18 months were more resistant to Pred and DNR; cells from children > 10 years were more resistant to Pred.

Monosomy 7 was readily confirmed in all cases during active disease. In two patients only a minority of nuclei was monosomic, whereas cytogenetics had shown all metaphases to be missing one chromosome 7. FISH in one of them was able to identify a small marker chromosome as isolated pericentromeric region of chromosome 7. Minimal residual disease however could not be detected in three remission samples analyzed, as percentages of disomic nuclei were within the range of normal controls (96.8% 2.1%). In order to determine lineage involvement of the monosomic clone, a recent technique combining immunophenotyping and FISH (FICTION) was performed in one patient with AML after MPD. Monosomy 7 was found in virtually all myelomonocytic and erythroid cells (as discriminated by lineage-specific antibodies), in a part of CD34-positive precursor cells, but not in lymphocytes.

Since FAMP is partially excreted by the kidney, toxicity in these two patients was likely due to receiving an effectively high dose of FAMP. Five patients developed peripheral neuropathy but there was no association with age, creatinine, dose of Ara-C, or number of courses. A patient, who also received intrathecal Ara-C, developed myelopathy. At this dose rate and duration of Ara-C peripheral neuropathy rarely arises, and cerebral toxicity is not seen. Neither toxicity was observed in 481 chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients treated with FAMP alone, by the same dose and schedule, suggesting that combination with Ara-C is important for the development of at least the peripheral neuropathy. The incidence of neurotoxicity with FAMP/Ara-C is low especially in comparison with high-dose Ara-C therapy (3 g/m2 over 2 hours). Cerebral toxicity can likely be decreased by dose reduction of FAMP in patients with increased creatinine and peripheral neuropathy decreased by detailed neurological examination before courses of FAMP/Ara-C.","['Kornblau, S M', 'Cortes-Franco, J', 'Estey, E']","['Kornblau SM', 'Cortes-Franco J', 'Estey E']","['Department of Hematology, University of Texas, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Blast Crisis/drug therapy', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy', 'Nervous System Diseases/*chemically induced', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/adverse effects/analogs & derivatives']",1993/03/01 00:00,1993/03/01 00:01,['1993/03/01 00:00'],"['1993/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1993 Mar;7(3):378-83.,,,,,,,,,,

Because the p12I protein is very hydrophobic and poorly immunogenic, we genetically engineered its cDNA by adding a short stretch of amino acids from the highly immunogenic epitope HA1 of influenza virus or the AU1 epitope of bovine papillomavirus. The HA1 epitope was also added to the p13II and p30II proteins, albeit rabbit immune sera raised against synthetic peptides were also available. To determine in which cellular compartments these proteins reside, we transfected the tagged and wild-type cDNAs in HeLa/Tat cells and studied their localization by indirect immunofluorescence. The p12I protein was identified in the cellular endomembranes and, particularly, in the perinuclear area. p13II and p30II were found in the nuclei and nucleoli of the transfected cells, respectively. The presence of the HA1 epitope at the carboxy terminus of p13II and p30II did not interfere with their cellular localization, since the rabbit immune sera demonstrated their presence in the same cellular compartments when the untagged proteins were expressed. The defined localization of these proteins in specific cellular compartments warrants further study of their function.","['Koralnik, I J', 'Fullen, J', 'Franchini, G']","['Koralnik IJ', 'Fullen J', 'Franchini G']","['Laboratory of Tumor Cell Biology, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (HTLV-I Antigens)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)']",IM,"['Alternative Splicing', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Compartmentation', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', '*Genes, pX', 'HTLV-I Antigens/metabolism', 'HeLa Cells', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Retroviridae Proteins/*metabolism']",1993/04/01 00:00,1993/04/01 00:01,['1993/04/01 00:00'],"['1993/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.67.4.2360-2366.1993 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1993 Apr;67(4):2360-6. doi: 10.1128/JVI.67.4.2360-2366.1993.,,,"['pX', 'rex', 'tax']",,PMC240398,,,,"['GENBANK/L08432', 'GENBANK/L08433']",

We used electrophoretic mobility shift and methylation interference assays to study nuclear factors which bind to a region of these enhancers whose sequence is identical between Moloney and Friend viruses and particularly highly conserved among 35 mammalian type C retroviruses whose enhancer sequences have been aligned (E. Golemis, N. A. Speck, and N. Hopkins, J. Virol. 64:534-542, 1990). Previous studies identified sites for the leukemia virus factor b (LVb) and core proteins in this region (N. A. Speck and D. Baltimore, Mol. Cell. Biol. 7:1101-1110, 1987) as well as a site, overlapping those for LVb and core, for a third factor (N. R. Manley, M. A. O'Connell, P. A. Sharp, and N. Hopkins, J. Virol. 63:4210-4223, 1989). Surprisingly, the latter factor appeared to also bind two sites identified in the Friend MLV enhancer, Friend virus factor a and b1 (FVa and FVb1) sites, although the sequence basis for the ability of the protein to bind these diverse sites was not apparent. Here we describe the further characterization of this binding activity, termed MCREF-1 (for mammalian type C retrovirus enhancer factor 1), and the identification of a consensus sequence for its binding, GGN8GG. We also identify a factor, abundant in mouse T-cell lines and designated LVt, which binds to two sites in the Moloney MLV enhancer, overlapping the previously identified LVb and LVc binding sites. These sites contain the consensus binding site for the Ets family of proteins. We speculate on how distinct arrays of these factors may influence the disease-inducing phenotype.","['Manley, N R', ""O'Connell, M"", 'Sun, W', 'Speck, N A', 'Hopkins, N']","['Manley NR', ""O'Connell M"", 'Sun W', 'Speck NA', 'Hopkins N']","['Center for Cancer Research, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge 02139.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (gammaretrovirus enhancer factor 1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line', 'Consensus Sequence', 'DNA, Viral/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*isolation & purification/*metabolism', '*Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/*genetics/pathogenicity', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics/pathogenicity', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides/chemistry', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Transcription, Genetic']",1993/04/01 00:00,1993/04/01 00:01,['1993/04/01 00:00'],"['1993/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.67.4.1967-1975.1993 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1993 Apr;67(4):1967-75. doi: 10.1128/JVI.67.4.1967-1975.1993.,,,,,PMC240265,,,"['CA51065-01A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01-CA42063/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA19308/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,

Selected nanoparticle formulations were tested in leukaemia- or melanoma-bearing mice after intravenous injection. Efficacy and toxicity of mitoxantrone nanoparticles were compared with a drug solution and with a mitoxantrone-liposome formulation (small unilamellar vesicles with a negative surface charge). Furthermore, influence of an additional coating surfactant, poloxamine 1508, which has been shown to change body distribution of other polymeric nanoparticles, was investigated. It was shown that PBCA nanoparticles and liposomes influenced the efficacy of mitoxantrone in cancer therapy differently: liposomes prolonged survival time in P388 leukaemia, whereas nanoparticles led to a significant tumour volume reduction at the B16 melanoma. Neither nanoparticles nor liposomes were able to reduce the toxic side-effects caused by mitoxantrone, namely leucocytopenia.

RESULTS: Of the 15 patients who remain in continuous bone marrow remission (range, 41 to 98 months), 14 had no detectable leukemic cells; one patient had a very low level (one in approximately 335,000 marrow cells) of residual leukemic cells that underwent clonal evolution. Among the nine patients who had a marrow relapse after the completion of treatment, eight patients whose relapses occurred 4 to 54 months from the end of therapy had no detectable leukemic cells, whereas only the one patient who relapsed 2 months after the completion of therapy had detectable residual disease. CONCLUSION: These observations indicate that the absence of detectable residual leukemia by PCR at the end of chemotherapy is not sufficient to assure that the patient is cured and suggest that frequent serial monitoring is required for the early prediction of relapse off therapy.","['Ito, Y', 'Wasserman, R', 'Galili, N', 'Reichard, B A', 'Shane, S', 'Lange, B', 'Rovera, G']","['Ito Y', 'Wasserman R', 'Galili N', 'Reichard BA', 'Shane S', 'Lange B', 'Rovera G']","['Wistar Institute, Philadelphia, PA 19104.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Base Sequence', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/drug therapy/genetics/*pathology', 'Cell Count', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/genetics/*pathology', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Recurrence']",1993/03/01 00:00,1993/03/01 00:01,['1993/03/01 00:00'],"['1993/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1993.11.3.546 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1993 Mar;11(3):546-53. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1993.11.3.546.,,,,,,,,"['CA10819/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA47983/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,

RESULTS: CCG 213P demonstrated the importance of dose interval, in that two courses of cytarabine and asparaginase administered at 7-day intervals gave superior 5-year survival rates (58% v 41% from the end of induction, P < .04) to the same therapy administered at 28-day intervals. CCG 213 showed that there was no advantage to the maintenance therapy used for patients who received two courses of cytarabine and asparaginase at 7-day intervals (5-year survival, 68% [no maintenance] v 44% [maintenance] from the end of consolidation, P < .01). Inclusion of the 7-day interval cytarabine/asparaginase intensification was accompanied by an overall improvement in 5-year survival rates from diagnosis when compared with historical controls (CCG 213, 36% v CCG 251, 29%, P < .02) although other differences between these studies could also be responsible for the improvement seen. CONCLUSION: High-dose cytarabine and asparaginase intensification eliminated the benefit of prolonged maintenance therapy in childhood AML and was accompanied by an overall improvement in survival.","['Wells, R J', 'Woods, W G', 'Lampkin, B C', 'Nesbit, M E', 'Lee, J W', 'Buckley, J D', 'Versteeg, C', 'Hammond, G D']","['Wells RJ', 'Woods WG', 'Lampkin BC', 'Nesbit ME', 'Lee JW', 'Buckley JD', 'Versteeg C', 'Hammond GD']","[""Children's Hospital Research Foundation, Cincinnati, OH.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage', 'Child', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy', 'Probability', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis']",1993/03/01 00:00,1993/03/01 00:01,['1993/03/01 00:00'],"['1993/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1993.11.3.538 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1993 Mar;11(3):538-45. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1993.11.3.538.,,,,,,,,"['CA 02971/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 13539/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 17829/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,

The current study was conducted to determine the relative contributions of each of these periods of intense therapy on the DFS rates of ALL patients with intermediate presenting features. In addition, due to concerns regarding the toxicity of CNS irradiation, we compared cranial irradiation (CXRT) with intrathecal methotrexate (IT MTX) administered during induction and consolidation to IT MTX during all phases of the treatment program. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between May 1983 and April 1989, more than 1,600 children with ALL and intermediate presenting features, as defined by the Childrens Cancer Group (CCG), were entered into a randomized trial that tested four systemic therapy regimens and two CNS programs. RESULTS: The results with a median follow-up of 57 months show that systemic regimens with a delayed intensification (Delint) phase of therapy had a 5-year event-free survival (EFS) rate of 73% compared with the control regimen EFS rate of 61% (p = .006). For children less than 10 years of age, standard three-drug induction and Delint produced a 77% 5-year EFS. IT MTX during all phases of therapy provided CNS protection comparable to the CXRT regimen in children less than 10 years of age. Children 10 years of age or older appear to have a better EFS rate with intensive induction, Delint, and CXRT. CONCLUSION: Delint improves the EFS rate of children with ALL and intermediate presenting features. Maintenance IT MTX can be safely substituted for CXRT for presymptomatic CNS therapy in children with intermediate-risk characteristics less than 10 years of age.","['Tubergen, D G', 'Gilchrist, G S', ""O'Brien, R T"", 'Coccia, P F', 'Sather, H N', 'Waskerwitz, M J', 'Hammond, G D']","['Tubergen DG', 'Gilchrist GS', ""O'Brien RT"", 'Coccia PF', 'Sather HN', 'Waskerwitz MJ', 'Hammond GD']","[""Children's Hospital, Denver, CO.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase III', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,['YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cranial Irradiation', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Injections, Spinal', 'Life Tables', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/*administration & dosage', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/radiotherapy', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",1993/03/01 00:00,1993/03/01 00:01,['1993/03/01 00:00'],"['1993/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1993.11.3.527 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1993 Mar;11(3):527-37. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1993.11.3.527.,,,,,,,,"['CA 02971/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 13539/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 17829/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We randomized 1,388 children with intermediate-risk ALL to the two CNS regimens. They received either IT MTX at intervals throughout their course of therapy or CXRT (18 Gy) during consolidation with IT MTX during induction, consolidation, and delayed intensification. Systemic therapy was randomized to one of four treatment regimens derived from a regimen used by CCG in recent studies for this patient population and three more intensive regimens based on the Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster trials. RESULTS: Life-table estimates at 7 years show a 93% and 91% CNS relapse-free survival rate for the CXRT and IT MTX groups, respectively. The corresponding event-free survival (EFS) rates are 68% and 64%. The differences are not significant. Patients who received more intensive systemic therapy had a 94% CNS relapse-free survival rate on either CXRT or IT MTX, while patients who received standard systemic therapy had 90% and 80% rates for CXRT and IT MTX, respectively (P < .0001). Patients less than 10 years of age who received CXRT or IT MTX had 72% and 71% EFS rates if they received more intensive systemic therapy. Patients 10 years or older who received CXRT had an improved EFS (61% v 53%) with a more intensive systemic program. This was primarily due to fewer bone marrow relapses (P = .04). CONCLUSIONS: IT MTX during induction, consolidation, and maintenance provides protection from CNS relapse in patients with intermediate-risk ALL equivalent to that provided by CXRT if more intensive systemic therapy is given. The CNS relapse rate with either CXRT or IT MTX is in part dependent on the associated systemic therapy. For intermediate-risk patients less than 10 years of age, IT MTX with an intensified systemic regimen provided CNS prophylaxis comparable to that provided by CXRT, whereas older patients had fewer systemic relapses if they received CXRT.","['Tubergen, D G', 'Gilchrist, G S', ""O'Brien, R T"", 'Coccia, P F', 'Sather, H N', 'Waskerwitz, M J', 'Hammond, G D']","['Tubergen DG', 'Gilchrist GS', ""O'Brien RT"", 'Coccia PF', 'Sather HN', 'Waskerwitz MJ', 'Hammond GD']","[""Children's Hospital, Denver, CO.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,['YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/*prevention & control/secondary', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', '*Cranial Irradiation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Injections, Spinal', 'Life Tables', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/*administration & dosage', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Prospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis']",1993/03/01 00:00,1993/03/01 00:01,['1993/03/01 00:00'],"['1993/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1993.11.3.520 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1993 Mar;11(3):520-6. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1993.11.3.520.,,,,,,,,"['CA 02971/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 13539/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 17829/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,

Treatment with lymphocytes from the original marrow donor and the influence on the malignant clone was studied in these patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Seven patients with CML that had relapsed after BMT with T-cell-depleted grafts were treated. Six patients received leukocyte infusions from the original marrow donor. One patient received a second BMT with unseparated marrow from the same sibling donor. Chimerism was studied using erythrocyte and cytogenetic markers. Residual leukemic cells were monitored by cytogenetic analysis of the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome and by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of the breakpoint cluster region/Abelson (BCR-ABL) fusion gene. RESULTS: In five patients with hematologic relapse, the Ph chromosome disappeared 1 to 3 months after the leukocyte infusions. Cytogenetic analysis and in situ hybridization (ISH) showed only donor cells during further follow-up. Four to five patients became negative for the BCR-ABL translocation by PCR. Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) always preceded response and was severe in two patients. One patient with cytogenetic relapse showed no response after leukocyte infusions. GVHD after second BMT was of moderate severity. One year after second BMT, PCR for the BCR-ABL translocation was negative. CONCLUSION: Infusion of donor leukocytes is an effective treatment with a low mortality in patients with CML relapsed after BMT with a T-cell-depleted graft. Longer follow-up and more patients will be needed to know whether cure will be permanent.","['Bar, B M', 'Schattenberg, A', 'Mensink, E J', 'Geurts Van Kessel, A', 'Smetsers, T F', 'Knops, G H', 'Linders, E H', 'De Witte, T']","['Bar BM', 'Schattenberg A', 'Mensink EJ', 'Geurts Van Kessel A', 'Smetsers TF', 'Knops GH', 'Linders EH', 'De Witte T']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital Nijmegen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Erythrocytes/immunology', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/immunology/surgery/*therapy', '*Leukocyte Transfusion', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Recurrence', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1993/03/01 00:00,1993/03/01 00:01,['1993/03/01 00:00'],"['1993/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1993.11.3.513 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1993 Mar;11(3):513-9. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1993.11.3.513.,,,"['ABL', 'BCR']",,,,,,,

We assessed the evolution of second cancer (SC) risk over a prolonged follow-up period, which has been rarely studied in large patient series. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We estimated the risk of SCs in 1,909 patients with testicular cancer diagnosed in the Netherlands from 1971 to 1985. Complete medical information was obtained up to at least January 1988 for 92% of patients. Median follow-up was 7.7 years. For 89% of second tumors the diagnosis was confirmed through review of histologic slides; for an additional 8%, the diagnosis was verified by pathology reports only. RESULTS: Seventy-eight patients developed a SC 1 year or more after start of treatment, as compared with 47.6 expected on the basis of incidence rates in the general population (relative risk [RR], 1.6; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3 to 2.1). The mean 15-year actuarial risk of all SCs was 9.8% (95% CI, 7.5% to 12.8%). Significantly increased RRs were observed for all gastrointestinal cancers combined (RR, 2.6; 95% CI, 1.7 to 3.9), stomach cancer (RR, 3.7; 95% CI, 1.8 to 6.8), contralateral testicular cancer (CLTC) (RR, 35.7; 95% CI, 21.8 to 55.2), and leukemia (RR, 5.1; 95% CI, 1.4 to 13.0). Patients who had received irradiation to the paraaortic lymph nodes and who survived testicular cancer for more than 5 years were at particularly high risk of developing stomach cancer (RR, 6.9; 95% CI, 3.3 to 12.7). The median interval between the diagnosis of testicular cancer and stomach cancer was 12.4 years. Patients treated with chemotherapy (CT) did not experience an increase in SCs in general. Indeed, CT-treated patients, as compared with those who received radiotherapy (RT), or surgery alone, had significantly reduced risk of CLTC. This finding might be attributed to an eradicating effect of CT on carcinoma in situ or subclinical CLTC. The excess risk of leukemia was not found to be clearly related to CT. CONCLUSION: Testicular cancer patients who receive RT experience elevated risk of gastrointestinal tumors. CT does not seem to increase SC risk and may even decrease the risk of a CLTC. Following testicular cancer, the 15-year actuarial risk of all SCs is only about half the risk experienced by patients with Hodgkin's disease.","['van Leeuwen, F E', 'Stiggelbout, A M', 'van den Belt-Dusebout, A W', 'Noyon, R', 'Eliel, M R', 'van Kerkhoff, E H', 'Delemarre, J F', 'Somers, R']","['van Leeuwen FE', 'Stiggelbout AM', 'van den Belt-Dusebout AW', 'Noyon R', 'Eliel MR', 'van Kerkhoff EH', 'Delemarre JF', 'Somers R']","['Department of Epidemiology, Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects', 'Combined Modality Therapy/adverse effects', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/etiology', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*etiology', 'Orchiectomy/adverse effects', 'Radiotherapy/adverse effects', 'Registries', 'Statistics as Topic', 'Testicular Neoplasms/*therapy']",1993/03/01 00:00,1993/03/01 00:01,['1993/03/01 00:00'],"['1993/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1993.11.3.415 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1993 Mar;11(3):415-24. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1993.11.3.415.,,,,['J Clin Oncol. 1993 Nov;11(11):2286-7.

HTLV-II was isolated from two Italian drug abusers belonging to the same cohort and coinfected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1. Two new isolates, HTLV-II Gu and Va, were established in a culture of BJAB cells, a continuous B cell line (Epstein-Barr virus-negative), and characterized by nucleotide sequence analysis of the long terminal repeat (LTR) and portions of the gag, env and X regions. These sequences were compared to those of the HTLV-II Mo isolate reported in the literature. No major variations were observed in important regulatory elements of LTR nor in the stem-bulge-loop configuration known to be essential for binding of rex protein. The results obtained from the sequence of the 1988 nucleotides examined indicated a 1.6% variability between the Gu and Va isolates and about 6% with respect to Mo. Notable differences were found in the structure of putative open reading frames of the X region when compared to those reported for the Mo isolate. Restriction analysis of proviral DNA of two isolates and comparison with the physical map of the Mo isolate confirmed the existence of genetic heterogeneity in the HTLV-II group and demonstrated that the new isolates Gu and Va belong to the HTLV-IIb subtype. The results of this study show that the new isolates have distinct features with respect to the Mo isolate though all important regulatory elements of the LTR appear to be well conserved.","['Zella, D', 'Cavicchini, A', 'Salemi, M', 'Casoli, C', 'Lori, F', 'Achilli, G', 'Cattaneo, E', 'Landini, V', 'Bertazzoni, U']","['Zella D', 'Cavicchini A', 'Salemi M', 'Casoli C', 'Lori F', 'Achilli G', 'Cattaneo E', 'Landini V', 'Bertazzoni U']","['Istituto di Genetica Biochimica ed Evoluzionistica del C.N.R., Pavia, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Gen Virol,The Journal of general virology,0077340,"['0 (RNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Genes, Viral/*genetics', '*Genome, Viral', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 2/*genetics/isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Italy', 'Nucleic Acid Conformation', 'RNA, Viral/chemistry', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid/genetics', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Substance Abuse, Intravenous/microbiology']",1993/03/01 00:00,1993/03/01 00:01,['1993/03/01 00:00'],"['1993/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1099/0022-1317-74-3-437 [doi]'],ppublish,J Gen Virol. 1993 Mar;74 ( Pt 3):437-44. doi: 10.1099/0022-1317-74-3-437.,,,,,,,,,,

In the excitation pathway a shutter control unit is mounted. With this control unit the period that the excitation pathway is 'opened' and 'closed' can be adjusted, to reduce cell damage and/or bleaching of the probe. This option allows time-lapse recording of experiments up to 1 h.

This phosphorylation was reversed by EDTA and by a synthetic peptide containing the sequence Arg-Gly-Asp, demonstrating a requirement for fibronectin-integrin interaction. Aggregation of Fc epsilon RI in fibronectin-adherent cells markedly enhanced the tyrosine phosphorylation of the same 105-115-kDa proteins. There were minimal differences in tyrosine phosphorylation of other proteins induced by the aggregation of Fc epsilon RI in nonadherent and in fibronectin-adherent cells. Direct activation of protein kinase C and/or increase in calcium influx induced the phosphorylation of the 105-115-kDa proteins only in fibronectin-adherent cells. The magnitude of the phosphorylation of the 105-115-kDa proteins induced by the aggregation of Fc epsilon RI in fibronectin-adherent cells was substantially greater than the sum of that due to adherence to fibronectin and the aggregation of Fc epsilon RI in nonadherent cells. Therefore, cell adherence and the aggregation of Fc epsilon RI synergistically regulate tyrosine phosphorylation of the 105-115 kDa proteins.","['Hamawy, M M', 'Mergenhagen, S E', 'Siraganian, R P']","['Hamawy MM', 'Mergenhagen SE', 'Siraganian RP']","['Laboratory of Immunology, National Institute of Dental Research, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Fibronectins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '37H9VM9WZL (Calcimycin)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Calcimycin/pharmacology', 'Fibronectins/*metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Molecular Weight', 'Phosphorylation', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Rats', '*Receptor Aggregation', 'Receptors, IgE/*metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tyrosine/*metabolism']",1993/03/05 00:00,1993/03/05 00:01,['1993/03/05 00:00'],"['1993/03/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/03/05 00:01 [medline]', '1993/03/05 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(18)53523-7 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1993 Mar 5;268(7):5227-33.,,,,,,,,,,

A20 is expressed in a wide variety of cell lines, including fibroblasts, in which A20 expression protects cells from TNF cytotoxicity. An analysis of A20 expression in lymphocytic and monocytic cells lines revealed that A20 protein expression correlates with lymphocyte activation and monocyte differentiation. A20 expression was also induced in Jurkat T cells expressing the human T cell leukemia virus type I Tax protein. Transient transfection studies demonstrated that stimulation of A20 transcription by TNF, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), and Tax was mediated by two kappa B elements within the A20 promoter. Accordingly, DNA electrophoretic mobility shift assays confirmed inducible binding of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B) to a promoter fragment containing both A20 kappa B elements. Analysis of individual A20 kappa B sites revealed that both kappa B sites were required for TNF or PMA activation of the A20 promoter; however, Tax activation required only one kappa B site. Overexpression of NF-kappa B subunits activated the wild type A20 promoter, but did not activate mutated forms containing single kappa B sites. Thus, Tax activation of A20 transcription occurs through a mechanism distinct from PMA and TNF, possibly due to differential activation of NF-kappa B complexes or transcriptional cofactors.","['Laherty, C D', 'Perkins, N D', 'Dixit, V M']","['Laherty CD', 'Perkins ND', 'Dixit VM']","['Department of Pathology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor 48109-0602.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 3.4.19.12 (TNFAIP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.19.12 (Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha-Induced Protein 3)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'DNA', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', '*Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Gene Products, tax/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proteins/*genetics', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha-Induced Protein 3', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology', 'Zinc Fingers/*genetics']",1993/03/05 00:00,1993/03/05 00:01,['1993/03/05 00:00'],"['1993/03/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/03/05 00:01 [medline]', '1993/03/05 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(18)53498-0 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1993 Mar 5;268(7):5032-9.,,,,,,,,"['AR 20557/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'HL 45351/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,

Their substrate specificities were examined using two in vitro assays of enzyme activity together with a panel of C7-C17 saturated fatty acids plus 72 myristic acid analogs containing oxygen, sulfur, ketocarbonyl, ester, amide, cis and trans double bonds, triple bonds, and para-substituted phenyl groups. There is an inverse relationship between the polarity and the activity of C14 fatty acid substrates of myristoyl-CoA synthetase. Surveys of tetradecenoic and tetradecynoic acids suggest that myristate is bound to the synthetase in a bent conformation with a principal bend occurring in the vicinity of C5-C6. The synthetase can tolerate a somewhat wider range of physical chemical properties in acyl chains than can the monomeric hNmt. However, like myristoyl-CoA synthetase, there is an inverse relationship between acyl chain polarity and the activities of hNmt's acyl-CoA substrates. Moreover, the acyl chain of myristoyl-CoA appears to be bound to hNmt in a bent conformation with bends located in the vicinity of C5 and C8. The acyl chain specificities of both enzymes make them well suited to utilize efficiently any cellular pools of 5Z-tetradecenoic and 5Z,8Z-tetradecadienoic acids and their CoA derivatives. This feature may account for the recent observation that in some mammalian cell lineages, certain N-myristoyl-proteins are heterogeneously acylated with these C14 fatty acids. Finally, the acyl-CoA binding sites of human and Saccharomyces cerevisiae Nmts appear to have been highly conserved. Given their overlapping yet distinct peptide substrate specificities, development of species-specific inhibitors of Nmts should probably focus on structural features recognized in the enzymes' peptide substrates rather than in the acyl chain of their acyl-CoA substrates.","['Kishore, N S', 'Wood, D C', 'Mehta, P P', 'Wade, A C', 'Lu, T', 'Gokel, G W', 'Gordon, J I']","['Kishore NS', 'Wood DC', 'Mehta PP', 'Wade AC', 'Lu T', 'Gokel GW', 'Gordon JI']","['Department of Infectious Diseases, G.

We tested the ability of spermidine to fulfill the role of putrescine under hyposmotic conditions. Although spermidine (1-30 microM) had no effect on growth under normosmotic conditions (325 mosm/kg), it was strongly inhibitory to D-R cell proliferation at 150 mosm/kg in a concentration-dependent manner. Hypotonic shock greatly increased the rate of spermidine uptake in D-R cells. The increased spermidine content enhanced total putrescine synthesis through a large induction of cytosolic spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase activity but also promoted the excretion of most of the putrescine synthesized by the cells. Delaying the addition of spermidine until 24 h after hypotonic shock resulted in a much sharper decrease in D-R cell viability and strongly depressed polyamine contents. These lethal effects occurred between 8 and 24 h after spermidine addition and followed a dramatic increase in the rate and extent of spermidine accumulation which overrode the metabolic capacity of the N1-acetyltransferase/polyamine oxidase (PAO) pathway. Inhibition of PAO partly reversed the effect of spermidine on growth when the polyamine was added at the time of hypotonic shock, but not 24 h later. Similar experiments performed with alpha-methylspermidine, a metabolically resistant analog, which can completely fulfill cellular requirements for spermidine in normosmotic media, suggested that the lethal effect of a delayed spermidine addition is caused predominantly by excessive accumulation with a minor contribution resulting from stress due to polyamine oxidase activity. In contrast, in hypotonically shocked L1210 cells, spermidine stimulated cell proliferation (albeit less effectively than putrescine), there was no lethal effect of a delayed addition of alpha-methylspermidine, and there was no time-dependent increase in the rate of alpha-methylspermidine uptake. Thus, the spermidine transport system is strongly enhanced by hyposmotic shock in D-R cells, which can result in extensive cell death from overaccumulation of the polyamine and, to a lesser extent, from stress related to the PAO-catalyzed degradation of N1-acetylspermidine. The absence of these effects in parental L1210 cells indicates that the acquisition of an ornithine decarboxylase-overproducing phenotype also involves major modifications in the expression and/or regulation of polyamine transport.","['Poulin, R', 'Coward, J K', 'Lakanen, J R', 'Pegg, A E']","['Poulin R', 'Coward JK', 'Lakanen JR', 'Pegg AE']","['Department of Cellular and Molecular Physiology, Milton S.

Labeled genomic test DNA, prepared from clinical or tumor specimens, is mixed with differently labeled control DNA prepared from cells with normal chromosome complements. The mixed probe is used for chromosomal in situ suppression (CISS) hybridization to normal metaphase spreads (CGH-metaphase spreads). Hybridized test and control DNA sequences are detected via different fluorochromes, e.g., fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) and tetraethylrhodamine isothiocyanate (TRITC). The ratios of FITC/TRITC fluorescence intensities for each chromosome or chromosome segment should then reflect its relative copy number in the test genome compared with the control genome, e.g., 0.5 for monosomies, 1 for disomies, 1.5 for trisomies, etc. Initially, model experiments were designed to test the accuracy of fluorescence ratio measurements on single chromosomes. DNAs from up to five human chromosome-specific plasmid libraries were labeled with biotin and digoxigenin in different hapten proportions. Probe mixtures were used for CISS hybridization to normal human metaphase spreads and detected with FITC and TRITC. An epifluorescence microscope equipped with a cooled charge coupled device (CCD) camera was used for image acquisition. Procedures for fluorescence ratio measurements were developed on the basis of commercial image analysis software. For hapten ratios 4/1, 1/1 and 1/4, fluorescence ratio values measured for individual chromosomes could be used as a single reliable parameter for chromosome identification. Our findings indicate (1) a tight correlation of fluorescence ratio values with hapten ratios, and (2) the potential of fluorescence ratio measurements for multiple color chromosome painting. Subsequently, genomic test DNAs, prepared from a patient with Down syndrome, from blood of a patient with T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia, and from cultured cells of a renal papillary carcinoma cell line, were applied in CGH experiments. As expected, significant differences in the fluorescence ratios could be measured for chromosome types present in different copy numbers in these test genomes, including a trisomy of chromosome 21, the smallest autosome of the human complement. In addition, chromosome material involved in partial gains and losses of the different tumors could be mapped to their normal chromosome counterparts in CGH-metaphase spreads. An alternative and simpler evaluation procedure based on visual inspection of CCD images of CGH-metaphase spreads also yielded consistent results from several independent observers.

Regulation of thromboxane synthase.,371-6,"Earlier studies on HL-60 cells induced to differentiate into macrophages by phorbol esters have shown a selective stimulation of thromboxane (Tx) formation from endoperoxide prostaglandin (PG) H2, indicating that Tx synthesis is regulated at the level of Tx synthase (TxS), one of the peripheral enzymes of the PGH-synthase pathway. We now report on the regulation of TxS during HL-60 macrophage differentiation using monoclonal anti-TxS serum and comparing turnover rates of TxS and its biological activity with those of other enzymes of arachidonic acid metabolism. Western-blot analysis, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, immunohistochemical staining and [35S]methionine-labeling experiments suggested a phorbol-ester-dependent early induction of synthesis of TxS. [35S]Methionine incorporation into TxS was stimulated within 4 h after initiation of differentiation and was associated with a major rise in the TxS catalytical activity. Pulse-chase experiments showed a half life for the TxS protein of 16.4 h in both control and phorbol-ester-treated cells. The biological half life of TxS was 10.5 h, as determined by PGH2 incorporation into TxB2 after cycloheximide treatment. In contrast, the biological half lives of PGH synthase, prostacyclin synthase and 5-lipoxygenase were significantly shorter and were 3, 2.5 and 2.5 h, respectively.

Clonogenic blasts from different ALL patients varied substantially in their ability to repair sublethal radiation damage. However, in 11 of 30 (37%) T-lineage ALL cases and 13 of 44 (30%) B-lineage ALL cases, the radiation survival curves of fresh LPC were characterized by a distinct initial shoulder, providing circumstantial evidence that LPC from a significant portion of ALL patients (24 of 74 cases = 32%) are able to repair sublethal radiation damage. Leukemic progenitor cells from 23 of 34 (68%) evaluable cases evaluated had alpha:beta ratios of < 5 Gy, indicating that they may possess a substantial capacity to repair sublethal radiation damage. In order to further elucidate the repair capacity of ALL LPC, we compared the antileukemic efficacy of fractionated irradiation with 2 x 2 Gy to the antileukemic efficacy of single-dose irradiation with 1 x 4 Gy. In 20 of 28 cases (71%), a > or = 20% increase in LPC survival (recovery factor > or = 1.2) was observed when 4 Gy were delivered in two doses instead of a single dose, providing direct evidence that ALL LPC are able to repair sublethal radiation damage.

Previous work has shown that mice receiving a transplant of bone marrow cells infected with a retroviral vector containing the human beta-globin gene can express human beta-globin specifically in erythroid cells; however, the level of expression of the transduced globin gene was low (1% to 2% per gene copy as compared with that of the endogenous mouse beta-globin gene). We report here the construction of a recombinant retrovirus vector encoding a human beta-globin gene fused to the 4 major regulatory elements of the human beta-globin locus control region (LCR). The LCR cassette increases the level of expression of the globin gene in murine erythroleukemia cells by 10-fold. To study the level of expression in vivo, mouse bone marrow cells were infected with virus-producing cells and the transduced cells were injected into lethally irradiated recipients. In the majority of provirus-containing mice (up to 75%), expression of human beta-globin in peripheral blood was detected at least 3 to 6 months after transplantation. Twelve animals representative of the level of expression of the transduced gene in blood (0.04% to 3.2% of the endogenous mouse beta-globin RNA) were selected for further analysis. A range of 0.4% to 12% of circulating erythrocytes stained positive for human beta-globin protein. Based on these values, the level of expression of the transduced gene per cell was estimated to be 10% to 39% of the endogenous mouse beta-globin gene. These data demonstrate that fusion of the LCR to the beta-globin gene in a retroviral vector increases the level of beta-globin expression in murine erythroleukemia cells and suggest that high-level expression can be obtained in erythroid cells in vivo after transduction into hematopoietic stem cells.","['Plavec, I', 'Papayannopoulou, T', 'Maury, C', 'Meyer, F']","['Plavec I', 'Papayannopoulou T', 'Maury C', 'Meyer F']","[""Laboratoire d'Oncologie Virale UPR 274, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Villejuif, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,['9004-22-2 (Globins)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', '*Cloning, Molecular', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/*metabolism', '*Gene Expression', 'Genes, Regulator', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Globins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/03/01 00:00,1993/03/01 00:01,['1993/03/01 00:00'],"['1993/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)85476-7 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1993 Mar 1;81(5):1384-92.,,,,,,,,,,

By morphology, cytochemical staining, and analysis of surface antigens, GF-D8 cells are myeloblasts of immature progenitor origin. The consensus karyotype is 45, XY, -5, 7q-, inv(7) (q31.2q36), 8q+, +8q+, 11q+, 12p-, -15, -17, + marker. The long-term survival and proliferation of GF-D8 cells is dependent on the presence of either granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) or interleukin-3 (IL-3). Weak colony growth was observed after exposure of GF-D8 cells to stem cell factor (SCF) but not after exposure to granulocyte-CSF (G-CSF), macrophage-CSF (M-CSF), IL-1 beta, IL-2, IL-5, or tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). GM-CSF- and IL-3-induced proliferation is dose dependent, with significant growth observed at concentrations as low as 0.1 ng/mL, but the combination of both factors has no synergistic effect. A significant proliferation is induced by GM-CSF and IL-3 even in serum-deprived cultures, although with a slightly decreased efficiency. GF-D8 cells were shown to express specific messenger RNAs for the alpha chains of the GM-CSF and IL-3 receptors as well as for the beta chain, common to both receptors. Interestingly, despite the absence of biologic response to G-CSF, specific transcripts for the G-CSF receptor gene were similarly identified by reverse polymerase chain reaction analysis. GF-D8 cells represent a useful tool for studying chromosome abnormalities of human AML as well as the regulation of myeloid proliferation and differentiation in vitro.","['Rambaldi, A', 'Bettoni, S', 'Tosi, S', 'Giudici, G', 'Schiro, R', 'Borleri, G M', 'Abbate, M', 'Chiaffarino, F', 'Colotta, F', 'Barbui, T']","['Rambaldi A', 'Bettoni S', 'Tosi S', 'Giudici G', 'Schiro R', 'Borleri GM', 'Abbate M', 'Chiaffarino F', 'Colotta F', 'Barbui T', 'et al.']","['Divisione di Ematologia Ospedali Riuniti, Bergamo, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Receptors, Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-3)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Interleukin-1/biosynthesis', 'Interleukin-3/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/immunology/*pathology', 'Male', 'Receptors, Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/analysis', 'Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/analysis', 'Receptors, Interleukin-3/analysis', '*Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/03/01 00:00,1993/03/01 00:01,['1993/03/01 00:00'],"['1993/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)85475-5 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1993 Mar 1;81(5):1376-83.,,,,,,,,,,

Radiation survival curves of primary clonogenic blasts (ie, LPC) were constructed for each patient using computer programs for the single-hit multitarget as well as the linear quadratic models of cell survival. The D0 values ranged from 49 to 891 cGy (median, 239 cGy; mean +/- SE, 307 +/- 44 cGy) and the alpha values ranged from 0.000 to 2.047 Gy-1 (median, 0.156 Gy-1; mean +/- SE, 0.284 +/- 0.078 Gy-1). Patients were divided into groups according to sex, age, white blood cell count (WBC) at diagnosis, plating efficiency of primary bone marrow blasts, and immunophenotype. Patient sex, age, WBC at diagnosis, or in vitro plating efficiency was not associated with radiation resistance. Notably, freshly isolated primary clonogenic blasts from patients with a CD19+CD24-CD34+ composite immunophenotype (stage I B-cell precursor [BCP]) had 2.2-fold higher D0 values (P = .005) and 3.4-fold lower alpha values (P = .05) than those from patients with a CD19+CD24+CD34+ (stage II BCP) or CD19+CD24+CD34- (stage III BCP) immunophenotype. The relative values for CD24- primary clonogenic blasts signify greater intrinsic radiation resistance. Furthermore, the CD19+CD24-CD34+ immunophenotype had a larger radiation resistant fraction. Whereas only 60% of CD19+CD24+CD34+ and 33% of CD19+CD24+CD34- cases had clonogenic blasts with alpha < or = 0.2, 100% of CD19+CD24-CD34+ cases had clonogenic blasts with alpha < or = 0.2. Furthermore, clonogenic blasts from established CD19+CD24- B-lineage ALL cell lines were significantly more radiation resistant than CD19+CD24+ B-lineage ALL cell lines. Notably, radiation doses sufficient to induce apoptosis of CD24- B-lineage ALL cells were higher than those capable of inducing apoptosis in CD24+ B-lineage ALL cells. Thus, the lack of CD24 surface antigen expression in B-lineage ALL is associated with intrinsic radiation resistance at the level of primary clonogenic blasts.","['Uckun, F M', 'Song, C W']","['Uckun FM', 'Song CW']","['Department of Therapeutic Radiology-Radiation Oncology, University of Minnesota Health Sciences Center, Minneapolis.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD24 Antigen)', '0 (CD24 protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/*analysis', 'Apoptosis/radiation effects', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/immunology/*pathology', 'CD24 Antigen', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Male', '*Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/immunology/*radiation effects', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/physiology', '*Radiation Tolerance', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/radiation effects']",1993/03/01 00:00,1993/03/01 00:01,['1993/03/01 00:00'],"['1993/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)85468-8 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1993 Mar 1;81(5):1323-32.,,,,,,,,"['CA-13539-19/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA-42633/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R29 CA 42111/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,

However, it is not established whether megakaryocytic differentiation is accompanied by the downregulation of the major erythroid transcription factor GATA-1 and the concomitant loss of the erythrocytic phenotype. Studies of the molecular mechanism of PMA-induced differentiation in HEL cells showed that when HEL cells are treated with PMA, they dramatically decrease the expression of the erythroid-specific gene glycophorin A at the mRNA level but apparently not at the steady-state protein level. In addition, a gel mobility shift assay was used to demonstrate that GATA-1, a major erythroid transcription factor normally present at high levels in HEL cells is downregulated after treatment with PMA. In contrast, the DNA-binding activities of transcription factors AP-1 and SP-1 are upregulated by PMA treatment of HEL cells. Furthermore, Northern blot analysis shows that PMA also downregulates the steady-state level of GATA-1 mRNA in HEL cells. The coordinated negative regulation of glycophorin A mRNA and GATA-1 expression after PMA treatment suggests that downregulation of GATA-1 expression may be partially responsible for the loss of the erythroid phenotype during megakaryocytic differentiation. The reported data also suggest that GATA-1 activity may not be essential for obtaining megakaryocytic phenotype during terminal differentiation in HEL cells.","['Dai, W', 'Murphy, M J Jr']","['Dai W', 'Murphy MJ Jr']","['Molecular Biology Laboratory, Hipple Cancer Research Center, Dayton, OH 45439-2092.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors)', '0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA1 protein, human)', '0 (Glycophorins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/analysis/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Down-Regulation', 'Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Glycophorins/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Megakaryocytes/*physiology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Transcription Factors/analysis/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/03/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1993/03/01 00:00'],"['1993/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1993/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)85455-X [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1993 Mar 1;81(5):1214-21.,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, it was determined that the cellular receptors for these three cytokines share a common beta-chain while having unique alpha-chains. Thus, there is considerable interest in how these cytokines and their receptors interact in promoting production of eosinophils. We have established a cell line (AML14) from a patient with acute myelogenous leukemia that will consistently exhibit eosinophilic differentiation in suspension in response to IL-3, IL-5, and GM-CSF. Proliferation with only modest differentiative effects was observed in response to a single cytokine. Combinations of two cytokines gave variable results, with GM-CSF + IL-3 and IL-3 + IL-5 causing more proliferation than a single cytokine but little more differentiation. The combination of GM-CSF + IL-5 caused marked enhancement of eosinophilic differentiation with only modest augmentation of proliferation. The combination of all three cytokines was most effective in stimulating both proliferation and eosinophilic differentiation (up to 70% of cells) of AML14 cells. Specific binding of GM-CSF and IL-5 to AML14 cells can be conveniently studied by flow cytometric methods, and cross-competition of these two cytokines for their respective receptors was demonstrated. IL-3 was shown to partially compete for IL-5 binding on AML14 cells. Although specific IL-3 binding could not be demonstrated by flow cytometry, mRNA for the alpha-chains of the IL-3, IL-5, and GM-CSF receptors and the beta-chain common to all three receptors was detected in AML14 cells. The AML14 cell line may be a useful model for the study of cooperative interactions of IL-3, IL-5, GM-CSF, and their respective receptors in the promotion of eosinophil progenitor growth and differentiation.","['Paul, C C', 'Tolbert, M', 'Mahrer, S', 'Singh, A', 'Grace, M J', 'Baumann, M A']","['Paul CC', 'Tolbert M', 'Mahrer S', 'Singh A', 'Grace MJ', 'Baumann MA']","['Research Service, Dayton VA Medical Center, OH 45428.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Interleukin-5)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Eosinophils/drug effects/*physiology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-5/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/03/01 00:00,1993/03/01 00:01,['1993/03/01 00:00'],"['1993/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)85452-4 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1993 Mar 1;81(5):1193-9.,,,,,,,,,,

Initial chemotherapy included vincristine, methotrexate, prednisolone, and L-asparaginase with cranial radiotherapy (18 Gy) for central nervous system prophylaxis. Documented growth failure led to recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) replacement therapy being instituted in May 1989, 6 years from end of therapy and 2 years prior to relapse. Three independent experiments demonstrated no increased cell proliferation in vitro when the patient's thawed cryopreserved fresh leukemic cells were incubated with rhGH. However, a pre-T ALL cell line (PER-255) consistently demonstrated enhanced proliferation when incubated with rhGH (132.1 +/- 13.4%, P < 0.01). Growth hormone has been associated with an increased incidence of leukemia and may be implicated in the late relapse of this child.

AKR/O-mice in the preleukemic adult age and younger mice during rapid growth were treated with recombinant human GH (rhGH) in human therapeutic doses to see whether this treatment would affect the time and presentation of malignant disease. The malignant development did not appear earlier or in a different way in the animals receiving rhGH from day 6 to 50 than in their appropriate controls. A borderline protective effect to the development of leukemia was seen in the adult group receiving rhGH; in this group antibodies to hGH also developed.

Efforts have been made towards elucidating the mechanism of action of this compound which, to date, have highlighted a high level of DNA sequence specificity for covalent adduct formation. Compared to classical alkylating agents, FCE 24517 forms very few covalent adducts with double-stranded DNA, and thus appears to be a weak alkylating agent. Examination of the effects of this minor groove-binding agent on the major groove of DNA have been facilitated by use of the alkylating agents mustine, melphalan, dabis maleate, quinacrine mustard and uracil mustard. Pretreatment of plasmid DNA with FCE 24517 followed by reaction with any one of these mustards gave rise to a marked abolition of N-7 guanine adduct formation, as assayed by Maxam and Gilbert sequencing gels. The smallest effect was seen for quinacrine mustard, whereas total abolition of N-7 guanine alkylation was seen with uracil mustard. Using related structural analogues of FCE 24517 in the same experiments, it was not possible to reproduce this effect, with very few exceptions. Some effects were seen when using distamycin A itself in these experiments, although these were marginal compared to those seen for FCE 24517. We were able to extrapolate our findings to a whole cell system using murine L-1210 leukaemia cells. Alkaline elution experiments showed that treatment of cultured cells with FCE 24517 followed by either mustine or uracil mustard caused a marked inhibition of DNA interstrand crosslink formation, compared to treatment with mustine or uracil mustard alone. The present study has demonstrated the marked effect that FCE 24517 has upon the reactivity of double-stranded DNA, an effect possibly separate from that of its alkylating function. This study has highlighted the complex nature of the DNA interactive compound FCE 24517 which possess potent and broad spectrum antitumour activity.","['Coley, H M', 'Mongelli, N', ""D'Incalci, M""]","['Coley HM', 'Mongelli N', ""D'Incalci M""]","['Istituto di Ricerche Farmacologiche Mario Negri, Milano, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Alkylating Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cross-Linking Reagents)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Distamycins)', '0 (Mustard Compounds)', '0 (Nitrogen Mustard Compounds)', '71193OXG6S (tallimustine)', '80O63P88IS (stallimycin)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Alkylating Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/pharmacology', 'Cross-Linking Reagents', 'DNA/chemistry/*drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Distamycins/*pharmacology', 'Drug Interactions', 'Mustard Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Nitrogen Mustard Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1993/02/09 00:00,1993/02/09 00:01,['1993/02/09 00:00'],"['1993/02/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/02/09 00:01 [medline]', '1993/02/09 00:00 [entrez]']","['0006-2952(93)90135-J [pii]', '10.1016/0006-2952(93)90135-j [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1993 Feb 9;45(3):619-26. doi: 10.1016/0006-2952(93)90135-j.,,,,,,,,,,

In this paper, the acceptor properties of the myeloid alpha 1-->3fucosyltransferase from human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells have been studied. Fucose transfer into glycolipid acceptors was activated by detergents G-3634-A or taurodeoxycholate resulting in efficient transfer to neutral acceptors but poor transfer to sialylated acceptors, characteristic of the myeloid-type enzyme. Fucose transfer to nLc6 yielded both mono- and difucosyl derivatives under both detergent conditions. The nLc6 monofucosyl products were isolated and analyzed by TLC immunostaining and fast atom bombardment-mass spectroscopy analysis. The G-3634-A monofucosyl product was found to be composed solely of V3FucnLc6, whereas that with taurodeoxycholate was determined to be a mixture of III3FucnLc6 and V3FucnLc6 in near equal amounts. Analysis of reaction products using enzyme activation by phospholipids indicated that phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylinositol behaved similarly to G-3634-A. In contrast, phosphatidylglycerol yielded results similar those of taurodeoxycholate. Fucose transfer to VI3NeuAcnLc6 yielded approximately 75% of the product as the III-GlcNAc monofucosyl derivative regardless of the detergent or phospholipid condition used. Analysis of fucose transfer to nLc6 catalyzed by the Lewis enzyme from Colo 205 cells using taurodeoxycholate yielded solely the III-GlcNAc monofucosyl derivative, whereas the predominant product with G-3634-A was V-GlcNAc fucosylated. In contrast, under both conditions only the V-GlcNAc monofucosylation product was found with the enzyme from NCI-H69 cells. The results indicate that subtle intrinsic differences exist between human alpha 1-->3fucosyltransferases. Modulation of enzyme specificity via the nature of the membrane environment could participate in regulation of expression of distinct cell surface antigens.","['Holmes, E H', 'Macher, B A']","['Holmes EH', 'Macher BA']","['Pacific Northwest Research Foundation, Seattle, Washington 98122.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Arch Biochem Biophys,Archives of biochemistry and biophysics,0372430,"['0 (Detergents)', '0 (Glycolipids)', '0 (Phosphatidylethanolamines)', '0 (Phosphatidylglycerols)', '0 (Phosphatidylinositols)', '0 (Phospholipids)', '28RYY2IV3F (Fucose)', '516-50-7 (Taurodeoxycholic Acid)', 'EC 2.4.1.- (Fucosyltransferases)', 'EC 2.4.1.152 (galactoside 3-fucosyltransferase)', 'V956696549 (Acetylglucosamine)']",IM,"['Acetylglucosamine/*metabolism', 'Carbohydrate Sequence', 'Colonic Neoplasms/enzymology', 'Detergents/pharmacology', 'Fucose/*metabolism', 'Fucosyltransferases/*metabolism', 'Glycolipids/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Granulocytes/*enzymology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/enzymology', 'Lung Neoplasms/enzymology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phosphatidylethanolamines/pharmacology', 'Phosphatidylglycerols/pharmacology', 'Phosphatidylinositols/pharmacology', 'Phospholipids/*pharmacology', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Fast Atom Bombardment', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Taurodeoxycholic Acid/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/02/15 00:00,1993/02/15 00:01,['1993/02/15 00:00'],"['1993/02/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/02/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/02/15 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0003-9861(83)71132-X [pii]', '10.1006/abbi.1993.1132 [doi]']",ppublish,Arch Biochem Biophys. 1993 Feb 15;301(1):190-9. doi: 10.1006/abbi.1993.1132.,,,,,,,,"['CA32826/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA41521/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K04CA01343/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,

Results of a randomized placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter trial.",495-503,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of fluconazole for prevention of fungal infections. DESIGN: A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter trial. PATIENTS: Adults (257) undergoing chemotherapy for acute leukemia. INTERVENTION: Patients were randomly assigned to receive either fluconazole (400 mg orally once daily or 200 mg intravenously every 12 hours) or placebo. The study drug was started at initiation of chemotherapy and continued until recovery of neutrophil count, development of proven or suspected invasive fungal infection, or the occurrence of a drug-related toxicity. MEASUREMENTS: Fungal colonization, proven superficial or invasive fungal infection, empiric antifungal therapy with amphotericin B, drug-related side effects, and mortality. MAIN RESULTS: Fluconazole decreased fungal colonization (83 of 122 [68%] placebo patients compared with 34 of 119 [29%] fluconazole patients colonized at end of prophylaxis, P < 0.001) and proven fungal infections (27 of 132 [21%] placebo patients compared with 11 of 123 [9%] fluconazole patients infected, P = 0.02). Superficial fungal infections occurred in 20 of 132 (15%) placebo patients but in only 7 of 123 (6%) fluconazole patients (P = 0.01), whereas invasive fungal infections developed in 10 of 132 (8%) placebo patients and in 5 of 123 (4%) fluconazole patients (P = 0.3). Fluconazole was especially effective in eliminating colonization and infection by Candida species other than Candida krusei (66 of 122 [64%] placebo patients colonized at end of prophylaxis compared with 11 of 119 [9%] fluconazole patients, P < 0.001; 22 of 132 [17%] placebo patients infected compared with 7 of 123 [6%] fluconazole patients, P = 0.005). Aspergillus infections were infrequent in both fluconazole (3 cases) and placebo groups (3 cases). The use of amphotericin B, the incidence of drug-related side effects, and overall mortality were similar in both study groups. CONCLUSION: Prophylactic fluconazole prevents colonization and superficial infections by Candida species other than Candida krusei in patients undergoing chemotherapy for acute leukemia and is well tolerated. Fluconazole could not be clearly shown to be effective for preventing invasive fungal infections, reducing the use of amphotericin B, or decreasing the number of deaths.","['Winston, D J', 'Chandrasekar, P H', 'Lazarus, H M', 'Goodman, J L', 'Silber, J L', 'Horowitz, H', 'Shadduck, R K', 'Rosenfeld, C S', 'Ho, W G', 'Islam, M Z', 'Buell, D N']","['Winston DJ', 'Chandrasekar PH', 'Lazarus HM', 'Goodman JL', 'Silber JL', 'Horowitz H', 'Shadduck RK', 'Rosenfeld CS', 'Ho WG', 'Islam MZ', 'Buell DN']","['Department of Medicine, UCLA Medical Center 90024.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Ann Intern Med,Annals of internal medicine,0372351,['8VZV102JFY (Fluconazole)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Female', 'Fluconazole/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Fungi/drug effects/growth & development', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*complications', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mycoses/*prevention & control', 'Neutropenia/*complications', 'Opportunistic Infections/*prevention & control', 'Prospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis']",1993/04/01 00:00,1993/04/01 00:01,['1993/04/01 00:00'],"['1993/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.7326/0003-4819-118-7-199304010-00003 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Intern Med. 1993 Apr 1;118(7):495-503. doi: 10.7326/0003-4819-118-7-199304010-00003.,,,,"['Ann Intern Med. 1993 Nov 1;119(9):951; author reply 952.

We examined the effect of mouse recombinant LIF on osteoclastic resorption in fetal bone explants representing different stages of osteoclast development. In cultures of 17-day-old fetal mouse metacarpals in which only osteoclast progenitors and precursors are present, resorption (measured as 45Ca release) was significantly inhibited to 29.2% and to 96.6% in the presence of LIF 100 and 1000 U/ml, respectively. Histologic examination of the explants treated with 1000 U/ml of LIF confirmed the biochemical findings and showed that osteoclast progenitors and precursors remained in the periosteum and did not invade the mineralized matrix. In metacarpals of older fetuses (18- and 19-day-old) in which the mineralized cartilage has been invaded by mature osteoclasts, the inhibition of resorption by LIF (1000 U/ml) was 87.9 and 74.7%, respectively, the latter being significantly less than the inhibition observed in 17-day-old metacarpal cultures. The inhibitory effect of LIF was absent during concurrent administration of PTH or 1,25-(OH)2D3 and could be reversed by PTH. In addition, LIF was found to inhibit growth, mineralization, and alkaline phosphatase activity in metacarpals independently of osteoclastic resorption. These results suggest that LIF affects the development rather than the activity of osteoclasts, probably through an effect on the osteogenic cells. LIF may be an important endogenous regulator of bone metabolism.","['Van Beek, E', 'Van der Wee-Pals, L', 'van de Ruit, M', 'Nijweide, P', 'Papapoulos, S', 'Lowik, C']","['Van Beek E', 'Van der Wee-Pals L', 'van de Ruit M', 'Nijweide P', 'Papapoulos S', 'Lowik C']","['Department of Endocrinology, University of Leiden, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Bone Miner Res,Journal of bone and mineral research : the official journal of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research,8610640,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Parathyroid Hormone)', 'EC 3.1.3.1 (Alkaline Phosphatase)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Acid Phosphatase)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Acid Phosphatase/metabolism', 'Alkaline Phosphatase/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Bone Development/*drug effects', 'Bone Resorption/metabolism', 'Bone and Bones/drug effects/*embryology/metabolism', 'Calcification, Physiologic/*drug effects', 'Calcitriol/pharmacology', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Culture Techniques', 'Female', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*pharmacology', 'Metacarpal Bones/embryology', 'Mice', 'Osteoclasts/*drug effects', 'Osteogenesis', 'Parathyroid Hormone/pharmacology', 'Pregnancy']",1993/02/01 00:00,1993/02/01 00:01,['1993/02/01 00:00'],"['1993/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jbmr.5650080210 [doi]'],ppublish,J Bone Miner Res. 1993 Feb;8(2):191-8. doi: 10.1002/jbmr.5650080210.,,,,,,,,,,

We have compared the properties of vEts and cEts1(p68). vEts interacts preferentially with an antibody that recognizes the active conformation of the DNA-binding domain. The DNA-binding activity of vEts is particularly sensitive to incubation conditions for band-shift assays, phosphorylation and modification by sulphydryl-specific reagents. Increased sensitivity is due to loss of a protective function of cEts1 C-terminal sequences. cEts2 has a related C-terminal sequence with a similar role. These results suggest that the vEts DNA-binding domain is more accessible to protein-protein interactions and to regulatory mechanisms. Indeed, vEts DNA binding is preferentially inactivated by oxidizing conditions in-vivo.

These new provirus insertions reproducibly contribute to enhanced growth, allowing the emergence of cell clones from the initially heterogeneous population of tumor cells. The Mo-MuLV-induced rat T cell lymphoma lines 2780d and 5675d, which are dependent on interleukin-2 (IL-2) for growth in culture (IL-2d), were placed in IL-2-free medium to select for IL-2-independent (IL-2i) mutants. Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA from these mutants, which was hybridized to a Mo-MuLV long terminal repeat probe, revealed that all mutants carried new provirus insertions (from one to four new proviruses per cell line). A locus of integration identified through cloning of the single new provirus detected in one of the IL-2i mutants, 2780i.5, was found to be the target of provirus insertion in 1 additional IL-2i cell line of 24 tested. A full-length cDNA of a gene (growth factor independence-1 [Gfi-1]) activated by promoter insertion in the 2780i.5 cells was cloned and shown to encode a novel zinc finger protein. Gfi-1 is expressed at low levels in IL-2d cell lines cultured in IL-2-containing medium and at high levels in most IL-2i cell lines, including the two harboring a provirus at this locus. Gfi-1 expression in adult animals is restricted to the thymus, spleen, and testis. In mitogen-stimulated splenocytes, Gfi-1 expression begins to rise at 12 h after stimulation and reaches very high levels after 50 h, suggesting that it may be functionally involved in events occurring after the interaction of IL-2 with its receptor, perhaps during the transition from the G1 to the S phase of the cell cycle. In agreement with this, Gfi-1 does not induce the expression of IL-2. Expression of Gfi-1 in 2780d cells following transfer of a Gfi-1/LXSN retrovirus construct contributes to the emergence of the IL-2i phenotype.","['Gilks, C B', 'Bear, S E', 'Grimes, H L', 'Tsichlis, P N']","['Gilks CB', 'Bear SE', 'Grimes HL', 'Tsichlis PN']","['Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19111.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Gfi1 protein, rat)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/drug effects/*genetics', 'Cell Transformation, Viral/drug effects/*genetics', 'DNA Probes', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Interleukin-2/*pharmacology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/etiology/*genetics/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Mutation', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Proviruses/genetics', 'Rats', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Selection, Genetic', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Tissue Distribution', '*Transcription Factors', 'Virus Integration', 'Zinc Fingers/genetics']",1993/03/01 00:00,1993/03/01 00:01,['1993/03/01 00:00'],"['1993/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/mcb.13.3.1759-1768.1993 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1993 Mar;13(3):1759-68. doi: 10.1128/mcb.13.3.1759-1768.1993.,,,['Gfi-1'],,PMC359488,,,"['CA-06927/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-38047/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-56110/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['GENBANK/L06986'],

BCR sequences have been shown to be required for activation of the tyrosine kinase and transforming functions of BCR/ABL. In this work, we show that two other structural requirements for full transforming activity of P210 BCR/ABL include a functional tyrosine kinase and the presence of tyrosine 1294, a site of autophosphorylation within the tyrosine kinase domain. Replacement of tyrosine 1294 with phenylalanine (1294F) greatly diminishes the transforming activity of BCR/ABL without affecting the specific activity of the protein tyrosine kinase. Expression of an exogenous myc gene in fibroblasts partially complements the transforming capacity of mutant P210 BCR/ABL (1294F). Surprisingly, tyrosine 1294 is not required for efficient induction of growth factor-independence in hematopoietic cell lines by P210 BCR/ABL. These results suggest that autophosphorylation at tyrosine 1294 may be important for recognition and phosphorylation of cellular substrates in the pathway of transformation, but it is not critical for mediating the events which lead to growth factor independence.","['Pendergast, A M', 'Gishizky, M L', 'Havlik, M H', 'Witte, O N']","['Pendergast AM', 'Gishizky ML', 'Havlik MH', 'Witte ON']","['Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, University of California, Los Angeles 90024.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Growth Substances)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Fibroblasts/physiology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/*metabolism', 'Genes, myc/genetics', 'Genetic Complementation Test', 'Growth Substances/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/etiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Mutation', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction']",1993/03/01 00:00,1993/03/01 00:01,['1993/03/01 00:00'],"['1993/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/mcb.13.3.1728-1736.1993 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1993 Mar;13(3):1728-36. doi: 10.1128/mcb.13.3.1728-1736.1993.,,,,,PMC359485,,,,,

One or more of its substrates may therefore be essential for signal transduction during lymphocyte activation. We have studied the phosphorylation of the closely related lck, fyn, and c-src tyrosine protein kinases in leukemic murine T-cell lines that have lost the expression of CD45. The phosphorylation of the lck kinase at an inhibitory site of tyrosine phosphorylation, Tyr-505, was increased by two-, six-, and eightfold in three different cell lines. Phosphorylation of the fyn kinase at the homologous site, Tyr-531, was unaltered in one of these cell lines, but increased by 2.5-fold in the two others. The phosphorylation of p60c-src at the homologous tyrosine was essentially unchanged in the one CD45-negative cell line in which it was examined. The expression of CD45 therefore regulates the phosphorylation and potentially the activity of the lck and fyn tyrosine protein kinases, but the effect on the lck kinase is much greater than on the fyn kinase. This finding and the observation that CD45 had no effect on the phosphorylation of p60c-src suggest that CD45 exhibits polypeptide substrate specificity in vivo. Additionally, these findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the unresponsiveness of CD45-negative lymphoid cells to antigenic stimulation is due largely to hyperphosphorylation of the lck kinase.","['Hurley, T R', 'Hyman, R', 'Sefton, B M']","['Hurley TR', 'Hyman R', 'Sefton BM']","['Molecular Biology and Virology Laboratory, Salk Institute, San Diego, California 92186.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (CSK Tyrosine-Protein Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fyn protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Lymphocyte Specific Protein Tyrosine Kinase p56(lck))', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fyn)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CSK Tyrosine-Protein Kinase', 'Cell Line', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'Leukemia, Experimental/metabolism', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens/genetics/*metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Specific Protein Tyrosine Kinase p56(lck)', 'Mice', 'Peptide Mapping', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/*metabolism', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fyn', 'Substrate Specificity', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/immunology/*metabolism', 'Tyrosine/metabolism', 'src-Family Kinases']",1993/03/01 00:00,1993/03/01 00:01,['1993/03/01 00:00'],"['1993/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/mcb.13.3.1651-1656.1993 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1993 Mar;13(3):1651-6. doi: 10.1128/mcb.13.3.1651-1656.1993.,,,,,PMC359477,,,"['CA 14195/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 42350/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,

The DP16-1 cell line was derived from the spleen cells of a mouse infected with the polycythemia strain of Friend virus, and like other erythroleukemia cell lines transformed by this virus, it grows independently of erythropoietin, likely because of expression of the viral gp55 protein which binds to and activates the erythropoietin receptor.

When stably transfected with a temperature-sensitive mutant of p53, these cells undergo rapid cell death upon induction of wild-type (wt) p53 activity at the permissive temperature. This process has features of apoptosis. In a number of other cell systems, wt p53 activation has been shown to induce a growth arrest. Yet, wt 53 fails to induce a measurable growth arrest in M1 cells, and cell cycle progression proceeds while viability is being lost. There exists, however, a relationship between the cell cycle and p53-mediated death, and cells in G1 appear to be preferentially susceptible to the death-inducing activity of wt p53. In addition, p53-mediated M1 cell death can be inhibited by interleukin-6. The effect of the cytokine is specific to p53-mediated death, since apoptosis elicited by serum deprivation is refractory to interleukin-6. Our data imply that p53-mediated cell death is not dependent on the induction of a growth arrest but rather may result from mutually incompatible growth-regulatory signals.","['Yonish-Rouach, E', 'Grunwald, D', 'Wilder, S', 'Kimchi, A', 'May, E', 'Lawrence, J J', 'May, P', 'Oren, M']","['Yonish-Rouach E', 'Grunwald D', 'Wilder S', 'Kimchi A', 'May E', 'Lawrence JJ', 'May P', 'Oren M']","['Department of Chemical Immunology, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Culture Media, Serum-Free)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Cell Cycle/*physiology', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Survival', 'Culture Media, Serum-Free/pharmacology', 'G1 Phase/physiology', 'Genes, myc', 'Interleukin-6/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/*physiopathology', 'Mice', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Transfection', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/drug effects/genetics/*metabolism']",1993/03/01 00:00,1993/03/01 00:01,['1993/03/01 00:00'],"['1993/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/mcb.13.3.1415-1423.1993 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1993 Mar;13(3):1415-23. doi: 10.1128/mcb.13.3.1415-1423.1993.,,,,,PMC359451,,,['R01 40099/PHS HHS/United States'],,

NF-kappa B is composed of distinct subunits; five independent genes, NFKB1(p105), NFKB2(p100), RelA(p65), c-rel and relB, that encode related proteins that bind to kappa B DNA elements have been isolated. We have previously found that NFKB2(p49/p52) acts in concert with RelA(p65) to stimulate the HIV enhancer in Jurkat T-leukemia cells. Here we examine the biochemical basis for the transcriptional regulation of HIV by NFKB2. Using Scatchard analysis, we have determined the dissociation constants of homodimeric p49 and heterodimeric p49/p65 for binding to the HIV kappa B site. p49 has a approximately 18-fold-lower affinity for the HIV kappa B site (KD = 69.1 pM) than does the approximately 50-kDa protein NFKB1(p50) derived from p105 (KD = 3.9 pM). In contrast, the affinity of heterodimeric NFKB2(p49)/RelA(p65) for this site is approximately 6-fold higher (KD = 11.8 pM) than that of p49 alone. Consistent with these findings, in vitro transcription was stimulated 18-fold by the addition of preformed, heterodimeric NFKB2(p49)/RelA(p65) protein. Transcriptional activation of the HIV enhancer was also subject to regulation by recently cloned I kappa B-alpha(MAD-3). Recombinant I kappa B-alpha(MAD-3) inhibited the DNA binding activity of p65, p49/p65, and p50/p65 but stimulated the binding of NFKB2(p49) or NFKB1(p50). Functional activation of an HIV reporter plasmid by p49/p65 in transiently transfected Jurkat T-leukemia cells was also inhibited by coexpression of MAD-3. These data suggest that binding of the NFKB2 subunit to the HIV enhancer is facilitated by RelA(p65) and that this NFKB2(p49)/p65 heterodimeric complex mediates transcriptional activation which is subject to regulation by MAD-3.","['Duckett, C S', 'Perkins, N D', 'Kowalik, T F', 'Schmid, R M', 'Huang, E S', 'Baldwin, A S Jr', 'Nabel, G J']","['Duckett CS', 'Perkins ND', 'Kowalik TF', 'Schmid RM', 'Huang ES', 'Baldwin AS Jr', 'Nabel GJ']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of Michigan Medical Center, Ann Arbor 48109-0650.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (I-kappa B Proteins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (NFKBIA protein, human)', '0 (Nfkbia protein, mouse)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factor RelA)', '139874-52-5 (NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha)', 'EC 2.3.1.28 (Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology', 'Base Sequence', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase/analysis', 'DNA Probes', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism/pharmacology', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'HIV/*genetics', 'HIV Enhancer/*genetics', 'Humans', '*I-kappa B Proteins', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Protein Conformation', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Transcription Factor RelA', '*Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Transfection']",1993/03/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1993/03/01 00:00'],"['1993/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1993/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/mcb.13.3.1315-1322.1993 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1993 Mar;13(3):1315-22. doi: 10.1128/mcb.13.3.1315-1322.1993.,,,,,PMC359440,,,"['AI26865/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI29179/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA21773/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,

The suitability of a nonlinear, two-compartment model for simulating M195 distribution in leukemia patients was evaluated by comparing model predictions with patient measurements. The results demonstrate that for directly accessible, hematologically distributed tumor cells, a two-compartment model fits observed patient biodistribution data and may provide information regarding both total tumor burden and tumor burden in the liver, spleen and red marrow. The model also provides biodistribution information for absorbed dose calculations to tissues that are not directly sampled.

The decrease in mtDNA was associated with a decrease in the rate of mitochondrial respiration and an increase in the concentration of lactate in the growth medium. Inhibition of cell proliferation by 4-quinolones was reversible upon drug washout. However, there was a 2- to 4-day lag before the growth rate returned to normal levels.

The level of HpPG gene expression in these cells was up-regulated approximately 10-fold upon 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-induced megakaryocytic differentiation, as measured by Northern blot analysis. The HpPG gene's expression remained relatively unchanged during hemin-induced erythroid differentiation, further demonstrating the specificity of this regulatory event for granule-producing cell lineages. The effect of TPA induction on HpPG gene expression was also assessed during the differentiation of the myeloid leukemia cell line, HL-60. The expression of the gene was down-regulated approximately 20-fold upon TPA-induced differentiation into macrophage-like cells. In contrast, only a minimal decrease in HpPG gene expression was detected in gamma-interferon-induced monocyte differentiation. No detectable changes in expression levels were seen in HL-60 cells differentiated into granulocytes with retinoic acid or dimethyl sulfoxide. Nuclear runoff analysis demonstrated that the regulation of the HpPG gene is under transcriptional control in both TPA-induced differentiation systems.","['Stellrecht, C M', 'Fraizer, G', 'Selvanayagam, C', 'Chao, L Y', 'Lee, A', 'Saunders, G F']","['Stellrecht CM', 'Fraizer G', 'Selvanayagam C', 'Chao LY', 'Lee A', 'Saunders GF']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Texas M.

In view of cellular adoptive immunotherapy, we have studied the role of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and gamma-interferon (IFN-gamma) in monocyte-mediated cytotoxicity on the level of both effector and leukemic target cells. Highly purified and IFN-gamma-activated monocytes were cytolytic to U937 cells up to 81.9 +/- 5.3% (mean +/- SEM) in a 24-hour MTT cytotoxicity assay at an effector-to-target-cell ratio of 10. Upon IFN-gamma activation these monocytes showed a 20-fold increase in TNF-alpha secretion of 663 +/- 122 pg/mL. Comparable concentrations of recombinant human TNF-alpha showed only cytostatic effects on U937 cells of approximately 20% after 24 hours, similar to the cytostatic effects of IFN-gamma-activated monocyte culture supernatants. These effects could be fully reversed by anti-TNF-alpha antibodies. U937 cells pretreated with TNF-alpha were almost completely resistant to monocyte-mediated cytotoxicity, supernatant-mediated cytostasis and to TNF-alpha up to 10(4) U/mL. IFN-gamma-activated monocytes were able to lyse TNF-alpha-modified U937 cells whereas IFN-gamma-activated monocyte supernatants showed only cytostatic activity after prolonged incubation. Additionally, target cell modulation by IFN-gamma potentiated the TNF-alpha-dependent cytolytic and cytostatic effects of monocytes, monocyte culture supernatants and TNF-alpha. We conclude that monocytes as a cellular component in monocyte-mediated cytotoxicity are far more potent in lysis of leukemic target cells than are secreted monokines. Furthermore, IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha are involved in the regulation of the susceptibility of leukemic cells for lysis by interactions with monocytes.","['van de Loosdrecht, A A', 'Beelen, R H', 'Ossenkoppele, G J', 'Broekhoven, M G', 'Langenhuijsen, M M']","['van de Loosdrecht AA', 'Beelen RH', 'Ossenkoppele GJ', 'Broekhoven MG', 'Langenhuijsen MM']","['Department of Hematology, University Hospital, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Antibodies/immunology', 'Cell Death/drug effects/*physiology', 'Colorimetry', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/physiology', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/pharmacology/*physiology/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/drug therapy/*pathology/*physiopathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/*physiology', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/pathology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/immunology/*physiology/therapeutic use']",1993/03/01 00:00,1993/03/01 00:01,['1993/03/01 00:00'],"['1993/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1993 Mar;21(3):461-8.,,,,,,,,,,

The 14 ML cases showed no histologically phenotypic differences and they were transplantable in syngeneic mice. We detected a specific chromosomal deletion in 1 copy of mouse chromosome 2 at regions D-E in all radiation-induced ML cells, regardless of radiation quality. Our results strongly implicate the involvement of genes within or close to regions D-E of chromosome 2 in radiation leukemogenesis.

Five patients received GM-CSF 10 micrograms/kg/d subcutaneously for 7 to 10 days immediately after IL-3 and 4 had a further increase in ANC (median 1.7-fold, range 1.6- to 5.8-fold), but no change in platelet transfusion requirements. Hematopoietic colony assays of bone marrow cells obtained before and after treatment showed that granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming cell (CFU-GM) and erythroid blast-forming cell (BFU-E) levels were severely reduced and multilineage progenitors (CFU-GEMM) absent in all patients, and remained low after IL-3 treatment for 21 days. Sequential IL-3 and GM-CSF produced a significant but transient increase in the neutrophil counts of some patients. IL-3 appears to be of limited benefit in patients who are severely aplastic after ABMT and have very low levels of bone marrow progenitors.","['Crump, M', 'Couture, F', 'Kovacs, M', 'Saragosa, R', 'McCrae, J', 'Brandwein, J', 'Huebsch, L', 'Beauregard-Zollinger, L', 'Keating, A']","['Crump M', 'Couture F', 'Kovacs M', 'Saragosa R', 'McCrae J', 'Brandwein J', 'Huebsch L', 'Beauregard-Zollinger L', 'Keating A']","['University of Toronto Autologous Bone Marrow Transplant Program, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Blood Cell Count/drug effects', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Division/drug effects/physiology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Female', 'Graft Rejection', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Granulocytes/cytology/drug effects/physiology', 'Hematopoiesis/drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/drug effects/physiology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/surgery', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/surgery', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/surgery', 'Neutrophils/cytology/drug effects/physiology', 'Recombinant Proteins/therapeutic use', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",1993/03/01 00:00,1993/03/01 00:01,['1993/03/01 00:00'],"['1993/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1993 Mar;21(3):405-410.,,,,,,,,,,

Since Ara-C is an antitumor agent known to induce differentiation in human acute myelogenous leukemia, also presumably a disorder of cellular maturation, we treated RD, a human embryonal RMS cell line, with Ara-C and evaluated its effect on growth and differentiation. Ara-C treatment of RD cells in vitro caused a dose-dependent growth inhibition in the absence of cytotoxicity. Interestingly, RD cells treated with 5 x 10(-7) M Ara-C for 4 days were able to recover logarithmic growth after the removal of the drug from the media. A reexposure of these cells to Ara-C led to morphological and biochemical changes related to differentiation, including the appearance of an increased number of multinucleated cells that expressed muscle-specific actin and skeletal muscle myosin heavy chain (MHC) (fast). In vivo studies demonstrated that RD cells pretreated with 5 x 10(-7) M Ara-C lost their ability to form tumors in nude mice. We conclude that treatment of this human embryonal RMS cell line with Ara-C results in marked growth inhibition in vitro, loss of tumorigenicity in vivo, and the expression of biochemical markers present in a more differentiated phenotype.

In conclusion, LIF accelerated bone turnover locally in a prostaglandin-independent manner in normal mice, demonstrating its potential to modify in vivo bone cell function dramatically.","['Cornish, J', 'Callon, K', 'King, A', 'Edgar, S', 'Reid, I R']","['Cornish J', 'Callon K', 'King A', 'Edgar S', 'Reid IR']","['Department of Medicine, University of Auckland, New Zealand.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Endocrinology,Endocrinology,0375040,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'XXE1CET956 (Indomethacin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Development/drug effects', 'Bone Resorption/*pathology', 'Bone and Bones/cytology/*drug effects', 'Fibrosis', 'Growth Inhibitors/genetics/*pharmacology', 'Indomethacin/pharmacology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/genetics/*pharmacology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Osteoblasts/cytology/*drug effects', 'Osteoclasts/cytology/*drug effects', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Time Factors']",1993/03/01 00:00,1993/03/01 00:01,['1993/03/01 00:00'],"['1993/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1210/endo.132.3.8440191 [doi]'],ppublish,Endocrinology. 1993 Mar;132(3):1359-66. doi: 10.1210/endo.132.3.8440191.,,,,,,,,,,

Guinea-pig L2C leukaemic lymphocytes, but not the human cell lines Daudi and Jurkat, revealed a degree of time- and temperature-dependent apoptotic death upon simple culture in vitro. NK cytotoxicity at low effector:target ratios (E:T) induced both release of 51Cr and apoptosis. However NK cytotoxicity at higher E:T, and ADCC at all E:T, increased the level of 51Cr release while reducing the level of apoptosis. The findings were consistent with the apoptotic process being cut short by intervention of necrotic death. The same characteristics accompanied ADCC whether the effectors were recruited by Fc gamma regions of antibody coating the targets, or by bispecific antibodies attaching one arm to the targets and the other to Fc gamma receptors type III on effectors. This finding, and the high level of cytotoxicity elicited by the bispecific method, confirm the belief that NK cells, in addition to exerting NK cytotoxicity, represent the principal effectors for ADCC among blood mononuclear cells. Our results suggest that NK cells have both apoptotic and necrotic mechanisms available for killing their targets, but use only the latter for ADCC.","['Curnow, S J', 'Glennie, M J', 'Stevenson, G T']","['Curnow SJ', 'Glennie MJ', 'Stevenson GT']","['Lymphoma Research Unit, Tenovus Laboratory, General Hospital, Southampton, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Chromium Radioisotopes)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies/immunology/pharmacology', 'Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity/*physiology', 'Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Cell Death/physiology', 'Chromium Radioisotopes', 'DNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Guinea Pigs', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/pathology/therapy', 'Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Lymphoma/pathology/therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred CBA', 'Rabbits', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF01741085 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 1993;36(3):149-55. doi: 10.1007/BF01741085.,,,,,,,,,,

However, the mechanism of action of Epo on megakaryocytic development remains to be determined. Recently, we reported the establishment of a human Epo-dependent megakaryoblastic leukemic cell line UT-7. Exposure of UT-7 to the tumor promoter, phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), resulted in the appearance of mature megakaryocytic properties, including the expression of platelet factor 4 and beta-thromboglobulin. With exposure to PMA, however, UT-7 cells lost their responsiveness to Epo and Scatchard analysis showed an 85% decrease in the number of Epo receptors after 24 h. While the number of binding sites declined, the affinity of Epo binding was unchanged. Associated with the decline in the number of Epo receptors was a profound decrease (> 95%) in the level of Epo receptor (Epo-R) mRNA. To determine the level of regulation of the Epo-R gene, its rate of transcription was measured by nuclear run-off assay in untreated cells and in cells exposed to PMA for 6, 12, and 24 h. The rate of transcription was nearly identical at all time points in control and PMA-treated cells. Stability of Epo-R mRNA also was measured in the presence of actinomycin D, an inhibitor of transcription. The half-life of Epo-R mRNA in untreated and PMA-treated cells was 90 and 30 min, respectively. These results indicate that the down-modulation of the expression of the Epo-R gene is mainly caused by increased instability of mature mRNA of Epo-R. Posttranscriptional regulation may be an important mechanism in the regulation of hematopoietic growth factor receptor genes and one of the mechanisms by which lineage restriction is achieved.","['Komatsu, N', 'Fujita, H']","['Komatsu N', 'Fujita H']","['Department of Medicine, Jichi Medical School, Tochigi, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Receptors, Erythropoietin)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'Down-Regulation', 'Erythropoietin/pharmacology', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/pathology', 'Megakaryocytes/*physiology', 'Receptors, Erythropoietin/*genetics', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/03/01 00:00,1993/03/01 00:01,['1993/03/01 00:00'],"['1993/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1993 Mar 1;53(5):1156-61.,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, DMSO was found to rapidly cause a 45% to 85% reduction in the specific binding of the growth factors granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor and insulin to their respective cell surface receptors on HL-60 human acute promyelocytic leukemia cells. Significant inhibition of binding was first observed after 30 min of DMSO treatment, occurred at both 4 degrees C and 37 degrees C, and was due to a DMSO-induced decrease in apparent receptor affinity, with little change in receptor number. A similar inhibition of insulin binding was seen with a second inducer of differentiation, hexamethylene bisacetamide. Kinetic studies demonstrated that DMSO enhanced the rate of insulin dissociation from its receptor. The inhibition of insulin binding by DMSO was also observed in a cell-free extract, suggesting that the effect was not a cell-mediated response to DMSO treatment. DMSO blocked the insulin-induced stimulation of protein tyrosine phosphorylation. These studies suggest that one action of DMSO may be the disruption of the structure and/or organization of cell surface receptors that regulate growth and differentiation.","['Schwartz, E L', 'Chamberlin, H', 'Ravichander, P', 'Whitbread, J A']","['Schwartz EL', 'Chamberlin H', 'Ravichander P', 'Whitbread JA']","['Department of Oncology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York 10467.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Insulin)', '0 (Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Insulin)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/*pharmacology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Insulin/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/metabolism', 'Receptor, Insulin/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/03/01 00:00,1993/03/01 00:01,['1993/03/01 00:00'],"['1993/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1993 Mar 1;53(5):1142-8.,,,,,,,,['P30 CA13330/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,

Transfected clones were isolated and tested for their capacity to secrete IFN-alpha 1 and their tumorigenicity when injected s.c. into immunocompetent syngeneic DBA/2 mice. Almost all FLC clones producing IFN in the range of 16-512 units/ml failed to grow when injected s.c. or i.p. into normal mice, whereas control FLC (transfected with a vector without the IFN gene) exhibited the highly malignant phenotype of the original FLC. High levels of IFN were detected in peritoneal fluid, tumor extracts, and sera of mice given injections of IFN-producing cells. Injection of mice with antibodies to IFN-alpha/beta resulted in the development of tumor ascites in mice transplanted i.p. with IFN-producing FLC. In contrast to the tumor rejection observed in immunocompetent mice, IFN-producing FLC were highly tumorigenic when transplanted into immunosuppressed nude mice. Mice given injections of IFN-producing FLC developed a long-lasting tumor-specific immune resistance to subsequent injection with highly metastatic FLC. Simultaneous s.c. injection of both metastatic FLC (approximately 10(3) 50% lethal doses) and IFN-producing cells resulted in potent inhibition of the tumor growth, with a survival rate of approximately 50% for injected mice. Contralateral injection (s.c.) of IFN-producing FLC into mice with established metastatic tumors produced a marked inhibition of tumor growth, with a survival rate of 10% for injected mice. These results indicate that: (a) the genetic modification of highly metastatic FLC by means of transfer of the IFN-alpha 1 gene results in potent tumor cell rejection, which is mediated by an IFN-induced host immune response; (b) injections of IFN-producing tumor cells are effective in inhibiting tumor growth in mice with established metastatic tumors. These data suggest that tumor cells transfected with the IFN-alpha gene might be used as an effective therapy for the treatment of certain human metastatic tumors, provided that suitable strategies are defined to prevent growth of the cytokine-producing cells.","['Ferrantini, M', 'Proietti, E', 'Santodonato, L', 'Gabriele, L', 'Peretti, M', 'Plavec, I', 'Meyer, F', 'Kaido, T', 'Gresser, I', 'Belardelli, F']","['Ferrantini M', 'Proietti E', 'Santodonato L', 'Gabriele L', 'Peretti M', 'Plavec I', 'Meyer F', 'Kaido T', 'Gresser I', 'Belardelli F']","['Laboratory of Virology, Istituto Superiore di Sanita, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,['0 (Interferon-alpha)'],IM,"['Animals', '*Friend murine leukemia virus', '*Genetic Therapy', 'Interferon-alpha/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', '*Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/03/01 00:00,1993/03/01 00:01,['1993/03/01 00:00'],"['1993/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1993 Mar 1;53(5):1107-12.,,,,,,,,,,

It is metabolized by cytochrome P450 2E1 to various phenolic metabolites which accumulate in the bone marrow. Bone marrow contains high levels of myeloperoxidase which can catalyze the further metabolism of the phenolic metabolites to reactive free radical species. Redox cycling of these free radical species produces active oxygen. This active oxygen may damage cellular DNA (known as oxidative DNA damage) and induce genotoxic effects. Here we report the induction of oxidative DNA damage by benzene and its phenolic metabolites in HL60 cells in vitro and in the bone marrow of C57BL/6 x C3H F1 mice in vivo utilizing 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine as a marker. HL60 cells (a human leukemia cell line) contain high levels of myeloperoxidase and were used as an in vitro model system. Exposure of these cells to phenol, hydroquinone, and 1,2,4-benzenetriol resulted in an increased level of oxidative DNA damage. An increase in oxidative DNA damage was also observed in the mouse bone marrow in vivo 1 h after benzene administration. A dose of 200 mg/kg benzene produced a 5-fold increase in the 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine level. Combinations of phenol, catechol, and hydroquinone also resulted in significant increases in steady state levels of oxidative DNA damage in the mouse bone marrow but were not effective when administered individually. Administration of 1,2,4-benzenetriol alone did, however, result in a significant increase in oxidative DNA damage. This represents the first direct demonstration of active oxygen production by benzene and its phenolic metabolites in vivo. The conversion of benzene to phenolic metabolites and the subsequent production of oxidative DNA damage may therefore play a role in the benzene-induced genotoxicity, myelotoxicity, and leukemia.","['Kolachana, P', 'Subrahmanyam, V V', 'Meyer, K B', 'Zhang, L', 'Smith, M T']","['Kolachana P', 'Subrahmanyam VV', 'Meyer KB', 'Zhang L', 'Smith MT']","['Department of Biomedical and Environmental Health Sciences, School of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley 94720.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Catechols)', '0 (Hydroquinones)', '0 (Phenols)', '339NCG44TV (Phenol)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)', 'LF3AJ089DQ (catechol)', 'XV74C1N1AE (hydroquinone)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Benzene/metabolism/*toxicity', 'Bone Marrow/*drug effects', 'Catechols/*toxicity', 'DNA/*drug effects', '*DNA Damage', 'Humans', 'Hydroquinones/*toxicity', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Phenol', 'Phenols/*toxicity', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/03/01 00:00,1993/03/01 00:01,['1993/03/01 00:00'],"['1993/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1993 Mar 1;53(5):1023-6.,,,,,,,,"['P42 ES004705/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'P30ES01896/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'P42ES04705/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']",,

DATA SOURCES: English-language articles concerning APL or its treatment with t-RA were identified with a MEDLINE search. STUDY SELECTION: All studies available at the time of article preparation, which addressed t-RA treatment in APL, were selected. DATA EXTRACTION: Data extraction and assessment were performed subjectively by the authors. An extensive discussion of specific study details is included in the article. DATA SYNTHESIS: APL is a unique subset of acute myelogenous leukemia and is typified by an accumulation of malignant promyelocytes in the bone marrow. Within the granulocyte cell cycle of a patient with APL, differentiation has been halted at the level of the promyelocyte, preventing formation of mature granulocytes. Upon treatment with traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy, complete remission rates of approximately 70 percent, with a five-year survival ranging from 25 to 40 percent have been achieved. In most patients with APL, a characteristic chromosomal t(15q+;17q-) translocation has been found, which may be responsible for the production of an aberrant retinoic acid receptor-alpha. Therefore, t-RA induction therapy has been investigated and has produced promising results. Administration of t-RA in dosages of 45-100 mg/m2/d has induced complete remissions. The apparent mechanism of t-RA is the induction of promyelocyte differentiation and maturation. The most common adverse effects noted have been dry skin, cheilitis, and headaches. CONCLUSIONS: Upon consideration of the initial trials, t-RA appears to be a promising and unique treatment for APL.","['Dulaney, A M', 'Murgatroyd, R J']","['Dulaney AM', 'Murgatroyd RJ']","['Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Ann Pharmacother,The Annals of pharmacotherapy,9203131,['5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Remission Induction', 'Tretinoin/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use']",1993/02/01 00:00,1993/02/01 00:01,['1993/02/01 00:00'],"['1993/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/106002809302700217 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Pharmacother. 1993 Feb;27(2):211-4. doi: 10.1177/106002809302700217.,8,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Ten patients were studied at diagnosis, on the morning PN was started, and three times during PN therapy coinciding with the sequential administration of three different amino acid solutions (Aminosyn, FreAmine HBC, and TrophAmine). The order of amino acid solution administration in each patient was by a randomized, block design. RESULTS: The patients were undergoing identical intensive induction therapy. There was no significant difference in the number of days they received PN or the amount of protein or calories received during the three PN study periods. At diagnosis, phenylalanine and glutamic acid concentrations were elevated compared with previously published normal values and remained elevated at all observation times. During PN, asparagine, aspartic acid, and tyrosine concentrations were significantly lower with all three amino acid solutions compared with their concentrations at diagnosis. Glycine and threonine concentrations were also significantly lower with FreAmine HBC and TrophAmine administration and cysteine concentrations were significantly lower with FreAmine HBC administration than at the time of diagnosis. Aminosyn was associated with plasma amino acid concentrations most similar to those measured at diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that most amino acid concentrations fall within the normal range at diagnosis in the ANLL patients studied. Plasma concentrations for certain amino acids can be influenced by the amino acid solution used in PN. Further understanding of the derangements in amino acid metabolism and the influence of parenterally administered amino acid solutions on plasma amino acid concentrations may lead to improvements in the nutritional support of cancer patients.","['Christensen, M L', 'Burgess, J', 'Helms, R A', 'Mirro, J Jr', 'Kalwinsky, D K', 'Storm, M C']","['Christensen ML', 'Burgess J', 'Helms RA', 'Mirro J Jr', 'Kalwinsky DK', 'Storm MC']","[""Pharmaceutical Division, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Ann Pharmacother,The Annals of pharmacotherapy,9203131,['0 (Amino Acids)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Amino Acids/administration & dosage/*blood', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*blood/diagnosis', 'Male', '*Parenteral Nutrition']",1993/02/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1993/02/01 00:00'],"['1993/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1993/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/106002809302700201 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Pharmacother. 1993 Feb;27(2):146-50. doi: 10.1177/106002809302700201.,,,,,,,,,,

However, in vitro and in vivo results using desferrioxamine a hexadentate iron chelating agent, for anti-cancer treatment are not always in agreement. Therefore, we have studied the response of three human tumour cell lines (HL-60 promyelocytic leukaemia, MCF-7 breast cancer and HepG2 hepatoma), grown in culture medium supplemented with either human pooled (HPS) or fetal bovine serum (FBS), to desferrioxamine. Desferrioxamine, at micromolar concentrations, induced severe cytotoxicity in all tumour cell lines grown in FBS medium. When grown in HPS medium, comparable desferrioxamine cytotoxicity was observed in the millimolar range. The addition of 50% saturated human transferrin to FBS medium resulted in protection against desferrioxamine cytotoxicity. HL-60 cells were further studied for iron metabolism characteristics. HL-60 cells, grown in medium with FBS, were found to have an 8.4 fold increase in surface transferrin receptor (TfR) expression (P < 0.001) as compared with HL-60 cells grown in medium with HPS. However, iron uptake of HPS cultured HL-60 cells, after incubation with saturated human transferrin, was higher, resulting in a higher concentration of iron in HPS cultured HL-60 cells as compared with FBS cultured cells (1.72 +/- 0.02 mumol/g protein v. 1.32 +/- 0.14 mumol/g protein; P < 0.001). Using desferrioxamine it was shown that TfR expression is dependent on the biological availability of iron in the cell. Consistent with the lower iron content in FBS cultured cells, we conclude that the cytotoxicity of desferrioxamine is dependent on the ability of cells to replenish cellular iron stores from the culture medium. Cells grown in FBS medium lack this ability and are therefore more susceptible to desferrioxamine.","['Voest, E E', 'Rooth, H', 'Neijt, J P', 'van Asbeck, B S', 'Marx, J J']","['Voest EE', 'Rooth H', 'Neijt JP', 'van Asbeck BS', 'Marx JJ']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital Utrecht, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cell Prolif,Cell proliferation,9105195,"['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', '0 (Transferrin)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)', 'J06Y7MXW4D (Deferoxamine)']",IM,"['Biological Availability', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Culture Media/*pharmacology', 'Deferoxamine/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Iron/metabolism', 'Receptors, Transferrin/*metabolism', 'Transferrin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*drug effects']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2184.1993.tb00008.x [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Prolif. 1993 Jan;26(1):77-88. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2184.1993.tb00008.x.,,,,,,,,,,

Monocytic maturation of hematopoietic cells (HL-60) induced by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D-3 (1,25(OH)2D3), results in a decrease in steady state c-myc mRNA levels. To elucidate the mechanism by which 1,25(OH)2D3 regulates c-myc mRNA expression, transcriptional and post-transcriptional modes of regulation were investigated. No transcriptional regulation was identified, however, 1,25(OH)2D3 appeared to decrease steady state c-myc mRNA levels by increasing its turnover rate. Using actinomycin D to block transcription, the half-life of c-myc mRNA was shown to decrease from 20 min in the absence of 1,25(OH)2D3 to < 5 min in the presence of 1,25(OH)2D3. Cycloheximide reversed the instability induced by 1,25(OH)2D3, prolonging the half-life of c-myc mRNA in both uninduced and 1,25(OH)2D3-induced HL-60 cells to > 60 min, indicating a translational requirement for the destabilization process. Additionally, the c-myc mRNA instability induced by 1,25(OH)2D3 in HL-60 appears to be a specific result of this agent, as indicated by the inability of other monocytic and granulocytic differentiation inducing agents to destabilize c-myc mRNA.","['Mangasarian, K', 'Mellon, W S']","['Mangasarian K', 'Mellon WS']","['School of Pharmacy, University of Wisconsin, Madison 53706.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 1.2.1.- (Glyceraldehyde-3-Phosphate Dehydrogenases)', 'EC 3.1.21.1 (Deoxyribonuclease I)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']",IM,"['Blotting, Northern', 'Calcitriol/analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Deoxyribonuclease I', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Genes, myc/*drug effects', 'Glyceraldehyde-3-Phosphate Dehydrogenases/genetics', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'RNA, Messenger/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/02/20 00:00,1993/02/20 00:01,['1993/02/20 00:00'],"['1993/02/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/02/20 00:01 [medline]', '1993/02/20 00:00 [entrez]']","['0167-4781(93)90269-J [pii]', '10.1016/0167-4781(93)90269-j [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1993 Feb 20;1172(1-2):55-63. doi: 10.1016/0167-4781(93)90269-j.,,,['c-myc'],,,,,,,

Prostatic cancer mortality showed a statistically significant association with external radiation exposure, largely confined to men who were also monitored for internal contamination by radionuclides other than plutonium. Prostatic cancer mortality was highest in radiation workers at Winfrith. In women monitored for radiation exposure, mortality from cancer of the uterus (including the cervix uteri) was increased relative to other employees, and, showed a statistically significant association with external radiation exposure. While there were some other statistically significant results, as would be expected by chance alone when multiple comparisons are made, there were no other cancer sites with consistently exceptional findings. Point estimates for risk associated with increasing exposure to radiation suggest a decrease of four deaths per 10(4) person-years per Sv for leukaemia and an increase of 20 deaths for all cancers except leukaemia, but confidence intervals indicate that a wide range of values are compatible with the data.

We have investigated the expression of mRNA for 13 cytokines and three transcription factors during in vitro culture of peripheral blood mononuclear cells, PBMC, with IL-2. A consistent pattern of induction was seen in nine individuals, with early (2-24 h) induction of IL-1 beta, IL-6, tumour necrosis factor, TNF, lymphotoxin, LT, and gro. TNF and LT mRNA was expressed continually throughout culture, but levels of mRNA for IL-1 beta, IL-6, and gro declined by 24-48 h.

IL-4, IFN-alpha, and IL-1 alpha mRNA was not detected. Only a minority of cells expressed mRNA for TNF, IL-1 beta, IL-6 and IFN-gamma, and monocytes were the main source.

Children and infants may present chronically with stones or acutely with renal failure from crystal nephropathy, as a result of inherited deficiencies of the purine salvage enzymes hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) and adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (APRT) or of the catabolic enzyme xanthine dehydrogenase (XDH). Genetic purine overproduction in phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthetase superactivity, or secondary to glycogen storage disease, can also present in infancy with renal complications. Children with APRT deficiency may be difficult to distinguish from those with HPRT deficiency because the insoluble product excreted, 2,8-dihydroxyadenine (2,8-DHA), is chemically very similar to uric acid. Moreover, because of the high uric acid clearance prior to puberty, hyperuricosuria rather than hyperuricaemia may provide the only clue to purine overproduction in childhood. Hyperuricaemic renal failure may be seen also in treated childhood leukaemia and lymphoma, and iatrogenic xanthine nephropathy is a potential complication of allopurinol therapy in these conditions. The latter is also an under-recognised complication of treatment in the Lesch-Nyhan syndrome or partial HPRT deficiency. The possibility of renal complications in these three situations is enhanced by infection, the use of uricosuric antibiotics and dehydration consequent upon fever, vomiting or diarrhoea. Disorders of urate transport in the renal tubule may also present in childhood. A kindred with X-linked hereditary nephrolithiasis, renal urate wasting and renal failure has been identified, but in general, the various rare types of net tubular wasting of urate into the urine are recessive and relatively benign, being found incidentally or presenting as colic from crystalluria. However, the opposite condition of a dominantly inherited increase in net urate reabsorption is far from benign, presenting as familial renal failure, with hyperuricaemia either preceding renal dysfunction or disproportionate to it. Paediatricians need to be aware of the lower plasma urate concentrations in children compared with adults when assessing plasma urate concentrations in childhood and infancy, so that early hyperuricosuria is not missed. This is of importance because most of the conditions mentioned above can be treated successfully using carefully controlled doses of allopurinol or means to render urate more soluble in the urine. Xanthine and 2,8-DHA are extremely insoluble at any pH. Whilst 2,8-DHA formation can also be controlled by allopurinol, alkali is contraindicated. A high fluid, low purine intake is the only possible therapy for XDH deficiency.","['Cameron, J S', 'Moro, F', 'Simmonds, H A']","['Cameron JS', 'Moro F', 'Simmonds HA']","[""Department of Renal Medicine, United Medical School, Guy's Hospital, London, UK.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Germany,Pediatr Nephrol,"Pediatric nephrology (Berlin, Germany)",8708728,"['0 (Purines)', '268B43MJ25 (Uric Acid)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Animals', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Gout/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Kidney Diseases/*metabolism', 'Purines/*metabolism', 'Uric Acid/*metabolism']",1993/02/01 00:00,1993/02/01 00:01,['1993/02/01 00:00'],"['1993/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00861588 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Nephrol. 1993 Feb;7(1):105-18. doi: 10.1007/BF00861588.,104,,,,,,,,,

J. 287, 717-724]. Further studies to investigate the mechanism by which these effects are brought about were carried out by comparing an L1210-derived cell line (R20) that is resistant to AbeAdo with the parent cells. The R20 cells were derived by two rounds of AbeAdo-induced cytostasis followed by rescue with exogenous polyamines. Cytostasis was induced in L1210 cells treated for 12 days with 10 microM AbeAdo; however, exposure to up to 40 microM AbeAdo did not induce cytostasis in R20 cells. Putrescine levels were elevated and spermine levels were depleted in both treated L1210 and treated R20 cells. Spermidine was depleted in treated L1210 cells but was only partly reduced in treated R20 cells. AdoMetDC activity was below the limit of detection in treated L1210 cells but, although greatly reduced, could be measured in the treated R20 cells. The resistance of the R20 cells to the effects of AbeAdo on cell growth and spermidine depletion correlated with reduced AbeAdo accumulation by R20 cells. In the absence of spermidine synthesis, unhypusinated eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A (eIF-5A) accumulated in AbeAdo-treated L1210 cells. There was no detectable accumulation of unhypusinated eIF-5A in R20 cells. Unhypusinated eIF-5A accumulated during AbeAdo treatment was depleted in L1210 cells rescued by exogenous spermidine. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that AbeAdo-induced cytostasis is due to the loss of hypusinated eIF-5A.

In the plasma of five patients (one with chronic myelogenous leukemia, two with prostatic cancer, and two with lymphoma), vWF abnormalities were observed during evolution of the thrombotic microangiopathy. These abnormalities were either the presence of unusually large (UL)vWF multimers of the type similar to those found within, and released or secreted by, endothelial cells (three patients) or a relative decrease in the largest plasma vWF multimers of the type that can be induced to attach to platelets (one patient) or both vWF abnormalities in different serial samples (one patient). In the one cardiac transplant patient who did not develop vWF multimeric abnormalities associated with thrombotic microangiopathy, vWF antigen levels were elevated more than threefold. This later individual received therapy with cyclosporin A alone. The other five thrombotic microangiopathy patients received cyclosporin A in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents (two patients); mitomycin-C, along with other chemotherapy (two patients); or multiple chemotherapeutic drugs, but not cyclosporin A or mitomycin C (one patient). The finding of vWF multimeric abnormalities during serial analysis of plasma samples from five of six patients with drug-associated thrombotic microangiopathy suggests the possibility that ULvWF forms derived from damaged or stimulated endothelial cells, along with the largest plasma vWF multimers, may be involved in the intravascular platelet clumping that is an essential part of the pathophysiology of this disorder.","['Charba, D', 'Moake, J L', 'Harris, M A', 'Hester, J P']","['Charba D', 'Moake JL', 'Harris MA', 'Hester JP']","['Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (Antigens)', '0 (Polymers)', '0 (Von Willebrand antigen)', '0 (von Willebrand Factor)', '368GB5141J (Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens/blood', 'Cyclosporine/adverse effects', 'Electrophoresis, Agar Gel', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Microcirculation', 'Polymers', 'Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate', 'Thrombosis/blood/*chemically induced', 'Vascular Diseases/blood/*chemically induced', 'von Willebrand Factor/*chemistry']",1993/03/01 00:00,1993/03/01 00:01,['1993/03/01 00:00'],"['1993/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.2830420306 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 1993 Mar;42(3):268-77. doi: 10.1002/ajh.2830420306.,,,,,,,,"['HL 35387/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'RR-00350/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,

Sixteen episodes were studied in six consecutive patients over a continuous 9 month period. One patient developed asymptomatic ventricular tachycardia during administration. Results from +20 and +90 min were compared with baseline by Wilcoxon matched pairs test. There was no significant change in potassium, albumin, or ionized calcium concentration at +20 or +90 min. The magnesium concentration at +20 min was significantly reduced (mean -0.04 mmol/liter; P < 0.05) but not so at +90 min.

Rex function involves its direct interaction with a complex stem-loop structure termed the Rex RNA response element (RexRE), which is located within the 3' retroviral long terminal repeat. Binding of Rex to the RexRE involves a positively charged arginine-rich domain located near the N-terminus which also functions as a nuclear localization signal. Strikingly, substitution of all seven of the arginine residues present within this domain with positively charged lysine residues exerted no adverse effect on the nuclear targeting of Rex. However, these lysine substitutions completely abrogated both Rex binding to the RexRE and Rex function. Reversion of multiple substituted lysines to arginines at specific locations within this domain was required to restore both RexRE binding and biological function to the Rex protein. Thus, while the presence of positive charge alone in this domain appears sufficient for nuclear localization of Rex, multiple arginine residues at specific sites are essential for the full expression of RNA binding and functional activity of this retroviral trans-regulatory protein.","['Hammes, S R', 'Greene, W C']","['Hammes SR', 'Greene WC']","['Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Department of Medicine, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina 27710.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['0 (Gene Products, rex)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '94ZLA3W45F (Arginine)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Arginine/genetics/*physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Gene Expression/genetics', 'Gene Products, rex/chemistry/*physiology', 'Haplorhini', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*chemistry', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation/genetics/physiology', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/chemistry/*physiology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins']",1993/03/01 00:00,1993/03/01 00:01,['1993/03/01 00:00'],"['1993/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0042-6822(83)71101-3 [pii]', '10.1006/viro.1993.1101 [doi]']",ppublish,Virology. 1993 Mar;193(1):41-9. doi: 10.1006/viro.1993.1101.,,,,,,,,['5T32GM07171/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,

Synchronized cells mixed with either 125I-antipyrine or 125I-BSA were frozen and stored at -196 degrees C for various periods to accumulate 125I decays. A clonogenic assay was used to measure the killing of these stored cells. Cells in G1-S and G2-M phases were more sensitive than those in late S phase for both 125I treatments. The ratio of survival in late S to that in G1-S (late S/G1-S) obtained by the decay of 125I-antipyrine, however, was much smaller than that obtained by the decay of 125I-BSA in the dose range examined.

The immunophenotypic profiles of a total of 17 HIV-1 carrier cell lines (nine newly and eight previously established cell lines) were compared with their respective parental noninfected cell lines. Except for total absence of CD4 expression, the expression of other antigens was variable among the 17 HIV-1 carrier cell lines. Persistent and consistent replication of infectious HIV-1 was detected in all of them in varying quantities. The great variability observed in both the altered marker expression, with respect to that of the noninfected parental cell lines, and in the quantities of persistently produced infectious HIV-1 was, nevertheless, specific to the individual cell lines. Furthermore, the present study demonstrates that there is no apparent correlation in the quantity of HIV-1 produced to either T cell, myelomonocytic cell, or megakaryocytic cell types. Instead, the results suggest that a particular interaction between HIV-1 and individual clonal cell lines may provide insight into the extremely complex immune dysregulation associated with the pathogenesis of acquired immune deficiency syndrome. Thus, the 17 HIV-1 carrier cell lines of diverse origin presented here provide valuable and unique models for further understanding acquired immune deficiency syndrome pathogenesis at the cellular and molecular levels.","['Matsuo, Y', 'Kamiya, T', 'Nakamura, S', 'Yamamoto, N', 'Uno, F', 'Yoshida, M', 'Nii, S', 'Kurimoto, M', 'Minowada, J']","['Matsuo Y', 'Kamiya T', 'Nakamura S', 'Yamamoto N', 'Uno F', 'Yoshida M', 'Nii S', 'Kurimoto M', 'Minowada J']","['Fujisaki Cell Center, Hayashibara Biochemical Laboratories, Inc., Okayama, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Soc Exp Biol Med,"Proceedings of the Society for Experimental Biology and Medicine.

This analysis was performed in conjunction with other studies suggesting a possible role for gag proteins in regulating nuclear events relating to processing and/or transport of viral genomic RNA. We detected Pr65gag and a p30-related protein in a nuclear fraction of infected cells. We also found evidence that a highly conserved amino acid sequence, which is shared by p30 and U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein 70-kDa protein, is a component of the nuclear targeting sequence for Pr65gag. Immunoelectron microscopy studies with a monoclonal anti-p12 antibody established that approximately 18% of gag-containing proteins of MoMuLV are located in the nucleus. Such gag-containing proteins from a mutant MoMuLV that lacks N-terminal myristic acid had greater affinity for the nucleus, suggesting that fatty acid acylation of Pr65gag plays a role in overcoming the proposed nuclear transport signal.

In this report, we present evidence that the provirus integrated in the Tpl-2 locus in 1 of 10 T-cell lymphomas harboring a Tpl-2 rearrangement (2779) is a recombinant between MoMuLV and virus-like 30 (VL30) sequences (Mo-VL30). Recombination between MoMuLV and VL30 may contribute to the transduction of ras, as suggested by the finding that VL30 flanks the ras oncogene in all of the ras transducing viruses isolated from rats to date. The Mo-VL30 recombinant described here represents evidence that recombination between MoMuLV and VL30 can be uncoupled from the transduction of ras, and it may precede the transduction. Sequence comparison between clones of Mo-VL30, Harvey sarcoma virus (Ha-MSV), and genomic c-Ha-ras revealed that all three share a 124-bp region of 87.3% homology. This region was detected at nucleotide positions -1845 to -1720 of c-Ha-ras and 20 bp 5' of the recombination breakpoint between VL30 and ras in Ha-MSV. On the basis of the sequence comparison between VL30, Ha-MSV, and c-Ha-ras, we are proposing a model which explains how VL30 may have facilitated the transduction of c-Ha-ras and perhaps the other ras proto-oncogenes. According to this model, the sequence homology between VL30 and c-Ha-ras targets this gene for transduction by promoting the integration of the provirus in this locus through homologous recombination.","['Makris, A', 'Patriotis, C', 'Bear, S E', 'Tsichlis, P N']","['Makris A', 'Patriotis C', 'Bear SE', 'Tsichlis PN']","['Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19111.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA, Recombinant)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras))']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Recombinant/genetics', 'Gene Library', 'Genes, ras/*genetics', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras)/*genetics', 'Proviruses/genetics', 'Rats', '*Recombination, Genetic', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', '*Transduction, Genetic', 'Virus Integration/genetics']",1993/03/01 00:00,1993/03/01 00:01,['1993/03/01 00:00'],"['1993/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.67.3.1286-1291.1993 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1993 Mar;67(3):1286-91. doi: 10.1128/JVI.67.3.1286-1291.1993.,,,['Tpl-2'],,PMC237495,,,"['CA-06927/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'RR-05539/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",['GENBANK/L06433'],

Cloning, sequencing, and phylogenetic comparisons of these amplified 140-bp pol fragments indicated that there are at least two distinct genetic substrains of HTLV-II in the Western Hemisphere. These data were confirmed for selected isolates by performing PCR, cloning, and sequencing with to 10 additional primer pair-probe sets specific for different regions throughout the PTLV genome. HTLV-II isolates from Seminole, Guaymi, and Tobas Indians belong in the new substrain of HTLV-II, while the prototype MoT isolate defines the original substrain. There was greater diversity among HTLV-II New World strains than among HTLV-I New World strains.

We previously reported that the primary neuropathogenic determinant of ts1 maps to a single amino acid substitution, Val-25-->Ile, in precursor envelope protein gPr80env. This Val-25-->Ile substitution apparently renders gPr80env inefficient for transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus. These findings suggest that the cytopathic effect of ts1 in neural cells might be due to the accumulation of gPr80env in the endoplasmic reticulum. Since endothelial and glial cells are targets of ts1 infection in the central nervous system, we established primary endothelial and astrocyte cultures to investigate the mechanism of cell killing caused by ts1. A continuous cell line, TB, was used as a control. Our results showed that both ts1 and MoMuLV-TB replicated and induced a cytopathic effect in astrocyte cultures, albeit to different degrees; ts1 appeared to be more lethal than MoMuLV-TB. On the other hand, ts1 and MoMuLV-TB infections of endothelial or TB cells were not cytopathic.

Chemical sequencing of eluted peptides identified a peptide derived from cytomegalovirus in both treated and untreated cells.

We showed previously that the extracellular matrix (ECM) protein thrombospondin (TSP) binds to PMN surface receptors and promotes adhesion and motility. Undifferentiated HL-60 cells did not adhere and were not motile in response to TSP, whereas cells differentiated toward PMN-like cells demonstrated both TSP-mediated adhesion and chemotaxis, with chemotaxis evident by day 2 of induction. With differentiation, a maximal response was obtained with 100 to 300 nM TSP, 10-fold lower than required for maximal PMN chemotaxis. Checkerboard analysis confirmed the directional nature of motility. mAb recognizing different domains of TSP inhibited chemotaxis, suggesting the involvement of multiple sites on TSP. Although both the NH2-terminal heparin-binding domain (HBD) and 140 kDa COOH-terminal fragment supported chemotaxis in PMN-like cells, neither fragment was as potent as intact TSP. Both pertussis and cholera toxin inhibited TSP-mediated chemotaxis, suggesting the involvement of GTP-binding proteins. The toxin effects did not indirectly result from elevated cAMP levels because high concentrations of either 8-bromo-cAMP or dibutyryl cAMP did not inhibit chemotaxis. TSP bound to nitrocellulose filters induced the directed migration (haptotaxis) of PMN-like cells rather than the random motility observed with PMN. Haptotaxis was stimulated by either the HBD or 140-kDa fragment and was inhibited by mAb against these two domains. Haptotaxis rather than random migration was confirmed by checkerboard analysis.

Many of these effects are proinflammatory and can contribute to the degree of tissue injury at a site of inflammation. Whereas recent investigations target IL-4 as a T cell product that can antagonize some of the responses induced by IFN, little is known regarding the mechanisms involved. We have taken advantage of two well defined systems: the transcriptional activation of the cellular genes ISG-54 by IFN-alpha and IP-10 by IFN-gamma. IL-4 treatment of both the monocytic leukemia cell line, THP-1, and normal peripheral blood monocytes resulted in inhibition of IFN-induced RNA levels for both genes. Nuclear run-on assays in THP-1 cells indicated that the effects of IL-4 were due to the inhibition of the transcriptional activation of these genes by both IFN-alpha and IFN-gamma. This inhibition was not due to alteration in the binding characteristics of IFN-alpha or IFN-gamma to the cell. In the IFN-alpha system, we were able to show that IL-4 treatment resulted in reduced formation of the transcriptional activator, IFN-stimulated gene factor 3. This reduction appears to be the result of a defect in the ability of IFN alpha to activate the IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 alpha component of IFN-stimulated gene factor 3.","['Larner, A C', 'Petricoin, E F', 'Nakagawa, Y', 'Finbloom, D S']","['Larner AC', 'Petricoin EF', 'Nakagawa Y', 'Finbloom DS']","['Food and Drug Administration, Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, Bethesda, MD 20892.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Interferon-alpha)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/*pharmacology', 'Interferon-gamma/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-4/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Monocytes/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/*drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/03/01 00:00,1993/03/01 00:01,['1993/03/01 00:00'],"['1993/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1993 Mar 1;150(5):1944-50.,,,"['IP-10', 'ISG-54']",,,,,,,

The common characteristics and regulation that make teleological sense in terms of co-ordinating local uterine immunity during pregnancy may also be important in transmission of congenital diseases such as AIDS.

The intracellular phosphorylation of ara-C to its 5'-triphosphate (ara-CTP) is a prerequisite for its cytotoxic effects. It has been shown in vitro that etoposide can impair the formation of ara-CTP in leukemia cells. The present study was undertaken in order to elucidate whether this interaction may be of clinical importance. Leukemia cells were isolated from 3 patients with acute myelocytic leukemia and incubated in medium (RPMI-1640) with or without 10% fetal calf serum or in human plasma. When the cells were incubated in RPMI-1640 with ara-C (10 mumol/l) and etoposide during 2 h, the formation of ara-CTP was decreased to 71 +/- 18 (mean +/- S.D.) and 30 +/- 15% of control at 1 and 10 micrograms/ml etoposide, respectively. When the cells were incubated in human plasma, the formation of ara-CTP was not influenced by the presence of etoposide (101 +/- 6 and 103 +/- 20% at 1 and 10 micrograms/ml etoposide). When incubated in RPMI supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, the corresponding figures were 81 +/- 8 and 70 +/- 20%. Six patients with AML were therefore treated with ara-C 0.5 or 1.0 g/m2 as a 2-h infusion every 12 h and, during 1 h before the second ara-C infusion, 100 or 200 mg/m2 etoposide was administered. The median change in the AUC of cellular ara-CTP between the first and second ara-C dose was 0% (-37 to +21%). The corresponding median change in rate of accumulation of ara-CTP in leukemia cells was 12% (-26 to +110%). The concentration of etoposide in plasma during the ara-C infusion was 18.7 +/- 5.1 micrograms/ml while the non-protein bound etoposide was 0.73 +/- 0.34 micrograms/ml. Thus, despite exposure to higher etoposide concentrations in vivo than in vitro, no impairment of ara-CTP formation was seen in the patients. This corresponds to the results obtained when leukemic cells were incubated in plasma. It is concluded that the inhibition of ara-CTP formation by etoposide seen in vitro is offset by the high protein binding of etoposide in plasma (96%) and that etoposide does not impair the formation of ara-CTP in leukemia cells in vivo during treatment with standard-dose etoposide.","['Liliemark, J', 'Knochenhauer, E', 'Gruber, A', 'Pettersson, B', 'Bjorkholm, M', 'Peterson, C']","['Liliemark J', 'Knochenhauer E', 'Gruber A', 'Pettersson B', 'Bjorkholm M', 'Peterson C']","['Department of Medicine, Karolinska Institute, Huddinge hospital, Sweden.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '13191-15-6 (Arabinofuranosylcytosine Triphosphate)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Arabinofuranosylcytosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Drug Interactions', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Phosphorylation']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0609.1993.tb00069.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 1993 Jan;50(1):22-5. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.1993.tb00069.x.,,,,,,,,,,

Proliferation of these pre-B cells is inhibited by interferon (IFN)-gamma, with half-maximal inhibition at concentrations between 0.1 and 1 unit/ml. Normal pre-B cells exposed to IFN-gamma die by apoptosis, as is evidenced by the disintegration of pre-B cell DNA into oligonucleosomal multimers of 180-200 bp. While the proliferation of pre-B cells from E mu-bcl-2 transgenic (tg) mice is inhibited by IFN-gamma, these cells do not die by apoptosis.

Of the remaining 7 rearranged V kappa genes, 4 differ from known germ-line genes by only one or two amino acid residues; and 3 differ from each other and from all known sequences by 5 or more residues, suggesting that somatic mutation has occurred in these 3 cases. We conclude that: (a) in at least three-quarters of cases the rearranged genes are unmutated; (b) there is preferential usage of individual V kappa genes but not of V kappa gene families; and (c) the V kappa genes used are widely dispersed in the V kappa locus.","['Wagner, S D', 'Luzzatto, L']","['Wagner SD', 'Luzzatto L']","['Department of Haematology, Royal Postgraduate Medical School, Hammersmith Hospital, London, GB.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,['0 (Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains)'],IM,"['Aged', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Female', '*Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Light Chain', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Humans', 'Hybrid Cells', 'Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Mutation']",1993/02/01 00:00,1993/02/01 00:01,['1993/02/01 00:00'],"['1993/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/eji.1830230214 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 1993 Feb;23(2):391-7. doi: 10.1002/eji.1830230214.,,,,,,,,,"['GENBANK/X66037', 'GENBANK/X66038', 'GENBANK/X66039', 'GENBANK/X66040', 'GENBANK/X66041', 'GENBANK/X66042', 'GENBANK/X66043', 'GENBANK/X66044', 'GENBANK/X66045', 'GENBANK/X66046', 'GENBANK/X67167', 'GENBANK/X67168', 'GENBANK/X67169', 'GENBANK/X67170', 'GENBANK/X67171', 'GENBANK/X67172', 'GENBANK/X67173', 'GENBANK/X67174', 'GENBANK/X67175', 'GENBANK/X67176', 'GENBANK/X67177', 'GENBANK/X67178', 'GENBANK/X67179', 'GENBANK/X67180', 'GENBANK/X67181', 'GENBANK/X67182', 'GENBANK/X67183', 'GENBANK/X67184', 'GENBANK/X67185', 'GENBANK/X67186', 'etc.']",

Mouse leukemia-cisplatin-resistant cell lines L1210/10 (adapted in vitro) and L1210/DDP (adapted in vivo) have been reported to exhibit an increase DNA-repair activity, as determined by host-cell reactivation after transformation with damaged plasmids. In this paper, excision-repair activity was monitored by an in-vitro assay allowing quantification of DNA-repair synthesis in cell extracts from resistant and sensitive parental cells (L1210/10 versus L1210/0 and L1210/DDP versus L1210/S). Experimental conditions for optimal repair-synthesis activity were found to be different from these reported with human cell-line extracts. L1210/S sensitive cell line, grown in vivo by a weekly intraperitoneal graft in mice, displayed a repair activity about fourfold lower than the same cell line maintained in vitro or than L1210/0 cell grown in vitro. The repair activity was found similar in a L1210/10 and L1210/0 cell lines, but it was enhanced in L1210/DDP resistant cell line when compared with its parental line.","['Calsou, P', 'Barret, J M', 'Cros, S', 'Salles, B']","['Calsou P', 'Barret JM', 'Cros S', 'Salles B']","['Laboratoire de Pharmacologie et Toxicologie Fondamentales, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Toulouse, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Biochem,European journal of biochemistry,0107600,"['9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cisplatin/*pharmacology', 'DNA/*biosynthesis', 'DNA Damage/drug effects', '*DNA Repair', '*Drug Resistance', 'Leukemia L1210/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/02/01 00:00,1993/02/01 00:01,['1993/02/01 00:00'],"['1993/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1432-1033.1993.tb17563.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Biochem. 1993 Feb 1;211(3):403-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1432-1033.1993.tb17563.x.,,,,,,,,,,

A possible feature of cytosine arabinoside neurotoxicity.,1303-8,"BACKGROUND: The use of high-dose cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C) may be complicated by a characteristic form of cerebellar neurotoxicity. Other reported manifestations of neurologic dysfunction include signs of possible cranial neuropathies, for which a neuropathologic substrate has not been previously reported. METHODS: A 43-year-old man was treated for refractory acute promyelocytic leukemia with a regimen of high-dose Ara-C. He died after dysarthria, ophthalmoplegia, and severe cerebellar neurotoxicity developed. RESULTS: The postmortem examination revealed a peculiar subacute neuronopathy that involved preponderantly brain stem tegmental and spinal motor neurons. The neuronopathy was characterized by hypereosinophilic perikarya and karyolytic nuclei. The perikaryal changes resulted from accumulations of argyrophilic masses of filaments that stained positively with neurofilament antibodies and ultrastructurally were shown to be composed of bundles of intermediate filaments. CONCLUSIONS: This report indicates that Ara-C neurotoxicity, possibly aggravated in our patient by oliguric renal failure, is not confined to the cerebellum but involves cranial nerve and spinal motor neurons, which in turn may explain the cranial neuropathies that sometimes complicate the use of high-dose Ara-C therapy.","['Vogel, H', 'Horoupian, D S']","['Vogel H', 'Horoupian DS']","['Department of Pathology (Neuropathology), Stanford University Medical Center, CA 94305.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Brain Stem/drug effects/ultrastructure', 'Cell Nucleus/drug effects/ultrastructure', 'Cytarabine/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Intermediate Filaments/*drug effects', 'Kidney Tubular Necrosis, Acute/chemically induced', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Motor Neurons/*drug effects/ultrastructure', '*Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurons/drug effects/ultrastructure', 'Spinal Cord/drug effects/ultrastructure']",1993/02/15 00:00,1993/02/15 00:01,['1993/02/15 00:00'],"['1993/02/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/02/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/02/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19930215)71:4<1303::aid-cncr2820710422>3.0.co;2-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1993 Feb 15;71(4):1303-8. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19930215)71:4<1303::aid-cncr2820710422>3.0.co;2-6.,22,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: In these patients, conventional endoscopic forceps biopsy did not provide a definite histologic diagnosis. Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) demonstrated that the disease was limited to the mucosa and the submucosa in all patients, without any paragastric lymph node involvement, so endoscopic mucosal resection was performed to obtain specimens large enough to include the submucosa. As a result, primary early gastric lymphoma was diagnosed in five patients, for whom subsequent gastrectomy confirmed the diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: The authors recommend that endoscopic mucosal resection be performed in patients thought to have primary early gastric lymphoma and for whom a definite diagnosis can not be made by conventional endoscopic forceps biopsy.","['Suekane, H', 'Iida, M', 'Kuwano, Y', 'Kohrogi, N', 'Yao, T', 'Iwashita, A', 'Fujishima, M']","['Suekane H', 'Iida M', 'Kuwano Y', 'Kohrogi N', 'Yao T', 'Iwashita A', 'Fujishima M']","['Second Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Kyusyu University, Fukuoka, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Biopsy/methods', 'Chronic Disease', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Gastric Mucosa/diagnostic imaging/*pathology', 'Gastritis/pathology', '*Gastroscopy', 'Humans', 'Hyperplasia', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnostic imaging/*pathology', 'Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Lymphoid Tissue/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Stomach Neoplasms/diagnostic imaging/*pathology', 'Stomach Ulcer/pathology', 'Ultrasonography']",1993/02/15 00:00,1993/02/15 00:01,['1993/02/15 00:00'],"['1993/02/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/02/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/02/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19930215)71:4<1207::aid-cncr2820710406>3.0.co;2-o [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1993 Feb 15;71(4):1207-13. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19930215)71:4<1207::aid-cncr2820710406>3.0.co;2-o.,,,,,,,,,,

The efficiency of the purge was evaluated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for BCR/ABL transcripts. In two LTCs initiated in the blastic stage, we demonstrated the selective effect of three culture media (serum dependent, serum-free (SF) supplemented or not with IL3 and GM-CSF) on the proliferative potential of normal hematopoietic (CFU-GM/BFU-E) and leukemic progenitors (CFU-ALL). BCR/ABL positive cells disappeared after 3 to 4 weeks of culture. The addition of IL3 and GM-CSF to the SF medium enhanced the growth of CFU-GM/BFU-E and shortened the purging period. We therefore carried out a LTC in the presence of IL3 and GM-CSF with marrow harvested in morphological remission.

DESIGN: Calculation of incidence of cancer using data from population based cancer registries and special surveys. SETTING: England and Wales; county of Cumbria; county districts Allerdale and Copeland within Cumbria; Seascale ward within Copeland. SUBJECTS: All residents under the age of 75 years in the above areas, but with particular reference to those aged 0-24 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Numbers of cases and incidence particularly of lymphoid leukaemia and non-Hodgkin lymphomas in those aged 0-24 years, but including other cancers and age groups. RESULTS: Previous reports of an increased incidence of cancer, especially of leukaemia, among those aged 0-24 years in Seascale during the period up to and including 1983 are confirmed. During 1984-90 there was an excess of total cancer among those aged 0-24 years. This was based on four cases including two cases of non-Hodgkin lymphoma but none of leukaemia. There was an increased, but nonsignificant, incidence of other cancers, based on two cases (one pinealoma and one Hodgkin's disease) occurring among those aged 15-24 years during 1984-90. This was not observed in the younger age group or in previous years. For the immediately surrounding area--that is, the county districts of Allerdale and Copeland excluding Seascale and in the remainder of Cumbria--there was no evidence of an increased incidence of cancer among those aged 0-24 years in either period. CONCLUSIONS: During 1963-83 and 1984-90 the incidence of malignant disease, particularly lymphoid leukaemia and non-Hodgkin lymphomas, in young people aged 0-24 in Seascale was higher than would be expected on the basis of either national rates or those for the surrounding areas. Although this increased risk is unlikely to be due to chance, the reasons for it are still unknown.","['Draper, G J', 'Stiller, C A', 'Cartwright, R A', 'Craft, A W', 'Vincent, T J']","['Draper GJ', 'Stiller CA', 'Cartwright RA', 'Craft AW', 'Vincent TJ']","['Childhood Cancer Research Group, University of Oxford.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,BMJ,BMJ (Clinical research ed.),8900488,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'England/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/etiology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/etiology', '*Nuclear Reactors', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/epidemiology', 'Wales/epidemiology']",1993/01/09 00:00,1993/01/09 00:01,['1993/01/09 00:00'],"['1993/01/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/09 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/09 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/bmj.306.6870.89 [doi]'],ppublish,BMJ. 1993 Jan 9;306(6870):89-94. doi: 10.1136/bmj.306.6870.89.,,['BMJ 1993 Mar 20;306(6880):761'],,,PMC1676669,,,,,

However, most of these approaches are only qualitative or semiquantitative at best. Moreover, the semiquantitative assays require rather large-scale procedures such as oligonucleotide hybridization or sampling of aliquots during the exponential phase of PCR amplification, which is time consuming and may be error prone. Using the deletion in the tal-1 gene as a clonal marker of malignant cells, which can be found in about 10-25% of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, we have developed a rapid and simple PCR assay for the quantification of residual leukaemic cells. The assay is based on heteroduplex formation between standard and template DNA sequences after coamplification of both DNA sequences in the same PCR reaction. The sensitivity of this PCR approach allows the detection of neoplastic cells at frequency of at least 10(-4). Application of such an assay needs not to be restricted to patients harbouring a tal-1 gene deletion. It may easily be adapted to other clonal DNA markers of blast cells and therefore facilitate monitoring of minimal residual disease in many different kinds of leukaemia.","['Borkhardt, A', 'Repp, R', 'Harbott, J', 'Kreuder, J', 'Lampert, F']","['Borkhardt A', 'Repp R', 'Harbott J', 'Kreuder J', 'Lampert F']","[""Children's Hospital, University of Giessen, Germany.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Nucleic Acid Heteroduplexes)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '135471-20-4 (TAL1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cell Count', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Gene Deletion', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nucleic Acid Heteroduplexes', '*Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', '*Transcription Factors']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1993.tb04628.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1993 Jan;83(1):39-44. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1993.tb04628.x.,,,,,,,,,,

DNA sequencing data of the protease gene fragment indicated that it contained an open reading frame capable of encoding the active HTLV-1 protease. To express a fusion protein of beta-galactosidase linked with the HTLV-1 protease in Escherichia coli, a plasmid DNA was constructed by inserting the HTLV-1 protease gene DNA into a procaryotic expression vector, pUEX2, consisting of a lacZ gene directed by a lambda phage Pr promoter and designated pUEX-pro. By Western blot analysis using anti-beta-galactosidase antibody, a bigger molecular size band than that of the control beta-galactosidase molecule was observed in E. coli cells transformed with pUEX-pro but not with control pUEX2, suggesting that the particular fusion protein was successfully expressed. This recombinant protease protein in the E. coli cell lysate was demonstrated to be able to cleave the decapeptide substrates composed of amino acid sequences containing proteolytic cleavage sites in the HTLV-1 gag precursor polyprotein. The gag precursor polyprotein expressed in the mammalian cells by the recombinant vaccinia virus system was also expectedly cleaved by this enzyme. Significant inhibition of this protease activity by pepstatin A, an aspartic proteinase-specific inhibitor, confirms that HTLV-1 protease is a member of the aspartic proteinase group as suggested previously. Since the crude lysate without purification is utilized sufficiently as a native HTLV-1 protease reagent, this protease preparation is easily applicable to the large scale screening of HTLV-1 protease inhibitors for the treatment of diseases caused by HTLV-1.","['Saiga, A', 'Tanaka, T', 'Orita, S', 'Sato, A', 'Sato, S', 'Hachisu, T', 'Abe, K', 'Kimura, Y', 'Kondo, Y', 'Fujiwara, T']","['Saiga A', 'Tanaka T', 'Orita S', 'Sato A', 'Sato S', 'Hachisu T', 'Abe K', 'Kimura Y', 'Kondo Y', 'Fujiwara T', 'et al.']","['Shionogi Institute for Medical Science, Osaka, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Austria,Arch Virol,Archives of virology,7506870,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Pepstatins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '11076-29-2 (Streptomyces pepsin inhibitor)', 'EC 3.2.1.23 (beta-Galactosidase)', 'EC 3.4.- (Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.23.- (Aspartic Acid Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.23.- (HTLV-1 protease)', 'V6Y2T27Q1U (pepstatin)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Aspartic Acid Endopeptidases/*biosynthesis/chemistry/metabolism', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Western', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Viral/analysis', 'Endopeptidases/*biosynthesis/chemistry/metabolism', 'Escherichia coli/*metabolism', 'Gene Products, gag/metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*enzymology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Pepstatins/pharmacology', 'Plasmids', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/biosynthesis/chemistry/metabolism', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Transformation, Genetic', 'beta-Galactosidase/metabolism']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF01309434 [doi]'],ppublish,Arch Virol. 1993;128(3-4):195-210. doi: 10.1007/BF01309434.,,,['gag'],,,,,,"['GENBANK/D11119', 'GENBANK/S51664', 'GENBANK/X62981', 'GENBANK/X62986', 'GENBANK/X62987', 'GENBANK/X62988', 'GENBANK/X62989', 'GENBANK/X62990', 'GENBANK/X74289', 'GENBANK/Z31011']",

A meta-analysis.,469-75,"BACKGROUND: Increasing evidence suggests that certain forms of adult leukemia may be related to cigarette smoking. METHODS: To evaluate the association between cigarette smoking and adult leukemia, we conducted a meta-analysis of available studies. Data were identified through an English-language MEDLINE search for the period 1970 through 1992 and through our knowledge of ongoing and unpublished studies. Among the studies identified, the meta-analysis included seven prospective studies and eight case-control studies. The US Surgeon General's criteria were used to assess the evidence for causality. RESULTS: A positive association between smoking and certain histologic types of leukemia was found in both prospective and case-control studies. The summary smoking-related risk derived from prospective studies (relative risk, 1.3; 95% confidence interval, 1.3 to 1.4) was greater than that based on case-control data (relative risk, 1.1; 95% confidence interval, 1.0 to 1.2). Prospective data suggested an elevated risk of myeloid leukemia associated with cigarette smoking (relative risk, 1.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.2 to 1.6). Pooled case-control data showed increased smoking-associated risk for acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (relative risk, 1.3; 95% confidence interval, 1.1 to 1.5). Risk of leukemia increased according to the number of cigarettes smoked per day. Population-attributable risk calculations suggested that approximately 14% of all US leukemia cases (including 17% of myeloid and 14% of acute nonlymphocytic leukemias) may be due to cigarette smoking. CONCLUSIONS: The consistency, temporality, and biologic plausibility of this relationship augment our findings, which support a causal relationship between cigarette smoking and certain forms of adult leukemia. Further studies are needed to examine risk among women, dose-response effects, and variation in risk by histologic type.","['Brownson, R C', 'Novotny, T E', 'Perry, M C']","['Brownson RC', 'Novotny TE', 'Perry MC']","['Missouri Department of Health, Columbia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis']",United States,Arch Intern Med,Archives of internal medicine,0372440,,IM,"['Adult', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Causality', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Prospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Smoking/*adverse effects/epidemiology', 'Sweden/epidemiology', 'United Kingdom/epidemiology', 'United States/epidemiology']",1993/02/22 00:00,1993/02/22 00:01,['1993/02/22 00:00'],"['1993/02/22 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/02/22 00:01 [medline]', '1993/02/22 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Arch Intern Med. 1993 Feb 22;153(4):469-75.,,,,['Arch Intern Med. 1993 Feb 22;153(4):425-7.

The diagnostic yield of skin biopsy and its effects on therapy.,175-81,"BACKGROUND AND DESIGN: Rashes in immunocompromised cancer patients can be important, and skin biopsies are often recommended for their evaluation. The objectives of this study were to determine how often skin biopsy in these patients is performed and how often it alters diagnosis and therapy. Records of all immunocompromised adults with cancer and acute rash seen by dermatology consultants on a hematology-oncology ward of a university hospital for 39 months were reviewed to determine patients' course and outcome (190 episodes of rash in 123 patients). RESULTS: Skin biopsies were performed on 108 rashes (57%); 82 rashes (43%) were evaluated without biopsy. Among the 108 patients who underwent a biopsy of their rashes, the biopsy findings supported the prebiopsy diagnosis in 51% (95% confidence interval [CI], 42% to 60%), altered it in 44% (95% CI, 35% to 53%), and did not contribute to the final diagnosis in 6% (95% CI, 2% to 12%). Fifteen of 108 biopsies (14%) (95% CI, 7% to 21%) changed systemic therapy. Most treatment changes were for cutaneous reactions to drugs; biopsy never resulted in the diagnosis of untreated systemic infection. Biopsy findings that altered diagnoses were not more likely to change therapy. Among the 82 rashes in which biopsies were not performed, review of the chart revealed no adverse sequelae (0%) (95% CI, 0% to 5%), which would have made a biopsy advisable. CONCLUSIONS: Skin biopsy findings often changed dermatologic diagnoses in immunocompromised cancer patients, but treatment changes based on biopsy results were much less common, and altered diagnoses in patients who underwent biopsy often did not change therapy. Untreated systemic infection was never diagnosed by means of a skin biopsy. Skin biopsies of these rashes may not be mandatory for either diagnostic or therapeutic reasons.","['Chren, M M', 'Lazarus, H M', 'Bickers, D R', 'Landefeld, C S']","['Chren MM', 'Lazarus HM', 'Bickers DR', 'Landefeld CS']","['Department of Dermatology (the Skin Diseases Research Center), University Hospitals of Cleveland and Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, OH.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Arch Dermatol,Archives of dermatology,0372433,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Biopsy/*methods', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Dermatitis/pathology', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Drug Eruptions/pathology', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/pathology', 'Humans', '*Immunocompromised Host', 'Leukemia/*complications', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Skin/pathology', 'Skin Diseases, Bacterial/pathology', 'Skin Neoplasms/pathology', 'Time Factors', 'Urticaria/*pathology/therapy']",1993/02/01 00:00,1993/02/01 00:01,['1993/02/01 00:00'],"['1993/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1001/archderm.129.2.175 [doi]'],ppublish,Arch Dermatol. 1993 Feb;129(2):175-81. doi: 10.1001/archderm.129.2.175.,,,,,,,,"['CA14548/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30AR39750/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'P30CA43703/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,

Twenty-three patients with Ph1 positive CML including 20 in the chronic phase and 3 in the accelerated phase, were treated with the combination therapy. Complete hematologic remission was obtained in all patients. Complete cytogenetic response (CCR) was obtained in 6 patients (26%), partial cytogenetic response (PCR) in 1 (4%), and minor cytogenetic response (MCR) in 6 (26%). In particular, of 13 patients in early chronic phase, 5 (39%) achieved CCR, 1 PCR, 3 MCR. Complete suppression of Ph1+clone was further confirmed by molecular analysis. Cytogenetic conversion to a normal diploid state persisted for 6-41+ months (median 22 months+). Three year survival rate was 86.6 +/- 9.0% (95% confidence limit). Furthermore, the long-term complete hematologic remission in the accelerated phase patients without progression of the disease may be indicative of a long-term survival. We conclude that Bestatin effectively controls CML and allows reappearance of diploid hemopoietic cells in some patients. The rationale for this combination therapy is that busulfan suppresses the proliferation of leukemic progenitors and decreases tumor burden to the level where Bestatin exhibits its antiproliferative effects. Bestatin is not merely antiproliferative but provides more complex biological properties capable of enhancing repopulation of normal residual stem cells.","['Uzuka, Y', 'Saito, Y']","['Uzuka Y', 'Saito Y']","['Sendai Hematologic Disorders Clinic, Japan.']",['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Gan To Kagaku Ryoho,Gan to kagaku ryoho.

Evidence that iron plays a role in dye-mediated photokilling is presented in this report. When sensitized with MC540 and irradiated with visible light, cultured murine leukemia L1210 cells underwent lipid peroxidation (accumulation of iodometrically detectable lipid hydroperoxides) and photokilling (loss of clonogenic capacity). Selenium-deficient [Se(-)] cells, which expressed minimal selenoperoxidase activity, were found to be more sensitive to photoperoxidation and photokilling than selenium-replete [Se(+)] controls. Since redox active iron in the presence of electron donors has been shown to exacerbate photoperoxidative damage in isolated membrane systems, it was of interest to examine the possible role of iron in MC540/light-induced cytotoxicity. Involvement of iron was established by showing (i) that desferrioxamine (a high-affinity chelator and redox inhibitor of Fe3+) acted protectively on Se(-) and Se(+) cells and (ii) that treating these cells with sublethal concentrations of the lipophilic chelate ferric 8-hydroxyquinoline [Fe(HQ)2] made them much more sensitive to photokiling and thiobarbituric acid-detectable lipid peroxidation. Lehal damage induced by t-butyl hydroperoxide was also amplified by Fe(HQ)2. Fe(HQ)2-enhanced photoperoxidation and photokilling were suppressed by alpha-tocopherol, suggesting that iron-catalyzed free radical reactions were involved. A mechanism based on iron-mediated one-electron reduction of nascent photoperoxides is proposed. We believe that under the conditions used, toxic one-electron chemistry overwhelms two-electron detoxification catalyzed by GSH-dependent selenoperoxidase(s).","['Lin, F', 'Girotti, A W']","['Lin F', 'Girotti AW']","['Department of Biochemistry, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee 53226.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Arch Biochem Biophys,Archives of biochemistry and biophysics,0372430,"['0 (Iron Chelating Agents)', '0 (Oxidants)', '0 (Peroxides)', '0 (Pyrimidinones)', '0 (Radiation-Sensitizing Agents)', '58823-12-4 (merocyanine dye)', '955VYL842B (tert-Butylhydroperoxide)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)', 'EC 1.11.1.9 (Glutathione Peroxidase)', 'H6241UJ22B (Selenium)', 'J06Y7MXW4D (Deferoxamine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Survival/*drug effects', 'Clone Cells', 'Deferoxamine/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Glutathione Peroxidase/pharmacology', 'Iron/*pharmacology', 'Iron Chelating Agents/pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L1210/enzymology', 'Light', 'Lipid Peroxidation/*drug effects', 'Mice', 'Oxidants/pharmacology', 'Peroxides/pharmacology', 'Pyrimidinones/*pharmacology', 'Radiation-Sensitizing Agents/*pharmacology', 'Selenium/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'tert-Butylhydroperoxide']",1993/02/01 00:00,1993/02/01 00:01,['1993/02/01 00:00'],"['1993/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0003-9861(83)71099-4 [pii]', '10.1006/abbi.1993.1099 [doi]']",ppublish,Arch Biochem Biophys. 1993 Feb 1;300(2):714-23. doi: 10.1006/abbi.1993.1099.,,,,,,,,['1-PO1-CA49089/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,

The 1.5-kb transcript is absent or detectable only at low levels in nonhematopoietic tissues. D4 encodes a 201-amino acid protein with homology to rhoGDI, an inhibitor of GDP dissociation for the ras-homologous protein rho. D4 might function also as a regulator of guanine nucleotide exchange for small GTP-binding proteins. A homologous transcript of similar size is also preferentially expressed in murine hematopoietic tissues. When totipotent murine embryonic stem cells develop in vitro into hematopoietic cells, the gene is activated with the onset of hematopoiesis. When hematopoietic cell lines are induced to differentiate, the expression of D4 is modulated. Thus, D4 appears to be a developmentally regulated gene. Its preferential expression in hematopoietic cells indicates that D4 likely plays some significant role in the growth and differentiation processes of hematopoietic cells. This significance is underscored by increasing evidence for the involvement of regulators of G proteins in clinical diseases.","['Lelias, J M', 'Adra, C N', 'Wulf, G M', 'Guillemot, J C', 'Khagad, M', 'Caput, D', 'Lim, B']","['Lelias JM', 'Adra CN', 'Wulf GM', 'Guillemot JC', 'Khagad M', 'Caput D', 'Lim B']","['Department of Medicine, Beth Israel Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02215.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '146-91-8 (Guanosine Diphosphate)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cattle', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA/*genetics', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Guanosine Diphosphate/metabolism', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/genetics', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'RNA, Messenger/*genetics', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/02/15 00:00,1993/02/15 00:01,['1993/02/15 00:00'],"['1993/02/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/02/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/02/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.90.4.1479 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1993 Feb 15;90(4):1479-83. doi: 10.1073/pnas.90.4.1479.,,,,,PMC45897,,,['DK 44099-02/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],['GENBANK/L07916'],

Treatment using the glycosylation processing inhibitors, castanospermine (CN), 1-deoxymannojirimycin (DMJ), and swainsonine (SW) resulted in a decrease of the relative molecular mass (M(r)) of both the alpha-chain of the high affinity receptor for IgE, Fc epsilon RI(alpha), and the low affinity receptor for IgE, Fc epsilon RL. Exposure to DMJ had the greatest effect on the M(r), while CN seemed to lead to a decreased cell surface expression of Fc epsilon RI. Both receptors are largely resistant to endoglycosidase H as their M(r) decreased only by approximately 2 kDa. These results suggest that both receptors are composed primarily of complex oligosaccharides with a single high mannose, N-glycosylated site. Both Fc epsilon receptors become endoglycosidase H sensitive if first exposed to DMJ which indicates that the carbohydrate composition is indeed altered by this processing inhibitor presumably by blocking the formation of complex structures. When the Fc epsilon receptors were reduced and hydrolyzed by N-glycanase, the M(r) values for Fc epsilon RI(alpha) and Fc epsilon RL decreased to approximately 28 and 34-38 kDa respectively. In the case of Fc epsilon RI(alpha), this implies the presence of only a small amount of O-linked oligosaccharides.","['LaCroix, E L', 'Froese, A']","['LaCroix EL', 'Froese A']","['Department of Immunology, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Canada.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Mol Immunol,Molecular immunology,7905289,"['0 (Oligosaccharides)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', 'EC 3.2.1.- (Glycoside Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.5.- (Amidohydrolases)', 'EC 3.5.1.52 (Peptide-N4-(N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminyl) Asparagine Amidase)']",IM,"['Amidohydrolases/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Glycoside Hydrolases/pharmacology', 'Glycosylation', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Molecular Weight', 'Oligosaccharides/*analysis', 'Peptide-N4-(N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminyl) Asparagine Amidase', 'Rats', 'Receptors, IgE/*analysis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/02/01 00:00,1993/02/01 00:01,['1993/02/01 00:00'],"['1993/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0161-5890(93)90060-o [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Immunol. 1993 Feb;30(3):321-30. doi: 10.1016/0161-5890(93)90060-o.,,,,,,,,,,

All the systems involved in DIC, such as coagulation, fibrinolysis, kallikrein-kinin, complement, and possibly other systems are regulated. Coagulation is the central event of DIC. The different coagulation factor derivatives may be generated that can be determined and used as markers for the degree of DIC and for effective control of therapy. Some of the procoagulant and anticoagulant factors are converted in the course of coagulation to their active forms and activation peptides. The active factor is subsequently neutralized by forming a complex with an inhibitor.

Immunohistochemical staining showed that proteasomes were strongly expressed in these tumor cells, especially in the nuclei. These data suggest that the elevated levels of serum proteasomes in these patients are derived from tumor cells, reflect the tumor burden, and so provide prognostic information. However, in patients with benign liver diseases, serum proteasome levels correlated with serum alanine aminotransferase activities, suggesting that in hematologic malignancies associated with liver injury some of the serum proteasomes may originate from hepatocytes.

METHODS: Twenty six restaging bone marrow biopsy specimens from 14 children with disseminated neuroblastoma were compared with 37 from 37 children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. They were assessed independently by two observers for the presence of abnormal fibrous stroma. All biopsies were performed 23 to 50 days after the initial diagnostic biopsy, and from the same iliac crest. A further nine restaging bone marrow biopsy specimens from previously unbiopsied iliac crests from four children with neuroblastoma were examined and the appearances of the diagnostic bone marrow specimens in those with neuroblastoma recorded. Between diagnostic and restaging biopsies, the children received combination chemotherapy regimens. RESULTS: In neuroblastoma abnormal stromal material was observed in 17 of 26 rebiopsied iliac crests as opposed to only 9 of 37 of those with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (p < 0.005). In addition, four of nine restaging biopsy specimens taken from previously unbiopsied crests in patients with neuroblastoma contained abnormal stroma. All 11 children with neuroblastoma whose restaging specimens contained abnormal stroma had similar abnormalities in one or more biopsy specimens at diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Abnormal fibrous stromal material in restaging marrow biopsy specimens of previously biopsied iliac crests occurs much more frequently in neuroblastoma than in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. We suggest that factors other than traumatic scarring are responsible. This is supported by finding similar abnormalities in previously unbiopsied iliac crests and in the diagnostic biopsy specimens of children with neuroblastoma.","['Turner, G E', 'Reid, M M']","['Turner GE', 'Reid MM']","['Department of Haematology, Royal Victoria Infirmary, Newcastle upon Tyne.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Clin Pathol,Journal of clinical pathology,0376601,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/pharmacology', 'Biopsy', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects/*pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Neuroblastoma/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/pathology', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/etiology/*pathology']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/jcp.46.1.61 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Pathol. 1993 Jan;46(1):61-3. doi: 10.1136/jcp.46.1.61.,,,,,PMC501116,,,,,

Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), both previously shown to regulate neurotransmitter development in cultured SCG neurons (Yamamori et al., 1989; Saadat et al., 1989), were examined for effects on receptor expression. Exposure of SCG neurons to LIF or CNTF (5 ng/ml) prevented the normal developmental increase in muscarinic receptors as measured by whole cell binding of N-methyl[3H]scopolamine. Reduction in receptor binding was detected within 2 to 4 days of treatment, with a 65-80% reduction after 16 days. Scatchard analysis demonstrated a reduction in total receptor number (Bmax) with no significant change in receptor affinity (Kd). Concentrations of 1 ng/ml of either factor reduced receptor expression with near-maximal effectiveness at doses of 10 ng/ml. The decrease in muscarinic receptors was not blocked by atropine, indicating that it was not agonist induced. Treatment with LIF or CNTF did not affect the survival of cultured neurons. Further, effects on receptor expression were reversible after discontinuance of treatment. Finally, treatment with either factor increased overall protein synthesis, indicating the integrity of cellular metabolism of cultures and hence the specificity of the decrease in muscarinic receptor number. LIF and CNTF thus regulate receptor as well as neurotransmitter development and could therefore play a role during synaptogenesis in the developing nervous system.","['Ludlam, W H', 'Kessler, J A']","['Ludlam WH', 'Kessler JA']","['Department of Neurology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York 10461.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Dev Biol,Developmental biology,0372762,"['0 (Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Nerve Growth Factors)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Muscarinic)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor', 'Culture Techniques', 'Ganglia, Sympathetic/cytology', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Growth Inhibitors/*physiology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*physiology', 'Nerve Growth Factors/*physiology', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/*physiology', 'Neurons/cytology/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Receptors, Muscarinic/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Sympathetic Nervous System/cytology/*metabolism']",1993/02/01 00:00,1993/02/01 00:01,['1993/02/01 00:00'],"['1993/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0012-1606(83)71047-X [pii]', '10.1006/dbio.1993.1047 [doi]']",ppublish,Dev Biol. 1993 Feb;155(2):497-506. doi: 10.1006/dbio.1993.1047.,,,,,,,,"['NS-20013/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'NS-20778/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM-7288/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,

A high correlation between the two assays was observed (r = 0.98), which enabled the cell-bound fluorescence output of 5-(SAENTA-x8)-fluorescein to be expressed in numbers of es nucleoside transporter sites per cell. The improved properties of 5-(SAENTA-x8)-fluorescein over those of its prototype molecule make it a suitable reagent for flow cytometric quantitation of nucleoside transporter expression on leukemic cells isolated from patient samples.","['Jamieson, G P', 'Brocklebank, A M', 'Snook, M B', 'Sawyer, W H', 'Buolamwini, J K', 'Paterson, A R', 'Wiley, J S']","['Jamieson GP', 'Brocklebank AM', 'Snook MB', 'Sawyer WH', 'Buolamwini JK', 'Paterson AR', 'Wiley JS']","['Department of Haematology, Austin Hospital Melbourne, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cytometry,Cytometry,8102328,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Fluoresceins)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Nucleoside Transport Proteins)', '0 (Purine Nucleosides)', '0 (Thionucleosides)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', ""130117-76-9 (5'-S-(2-aminoethyl)-N(6)-(4-nitrobenzyl)-5'-thioadenosine)"", '147395-08-2 (5-(SAENTA-x8)fluorescein)', '46S541971T (Thioinosine)', 'GV1L2DZM2Z (4-nitrobenzylthioinosine)', 'K72T3FS567 (Adenosine)']",IM,"['Adenosine/analogs & derivatives', 'Binding Sites', 'Carrier Proteins/*analysis', 'Cell Line', 'Cytarabine/metabolism', 'Fluoresceins/*chemical synthesis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism/pathology', 'Ligands', 'Membrane Proteins/*analysis', 'Nucleoside Transport Proteins', 'Purine Nucleosides/*chemical synthesis', 'Thioinosine/analogs & derivatives', 'Thionucleosides']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cyto.990140107 [doi]'],ppublish,Cytometry. 1993;14(1):32-8. doi: 10.1002/cyto.990140107.,,,,,,,,,,

Hairy cell conditioned medium (HCCM) obtained from HCL patients with PPH augmented IgG production by normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells in a dose-dependent fashion, while HCCM from patients without PPH had no effect on IgG production. HCCM from the patients with PPH failed to enhance IgG synthesis by T cell-depleted mononuclear cells. Separation of T and B cells by a 0.4-microns membrane as well as monoclonal antibodies to HLA-DR and CD3 molecules prevented HCCM-dependent IgG synthesis. No B cell growth factor activity, interleukin-1, or interleukin-6 was detected in the HCCM. On examination by fractionation of the HCCM, IgG-inducing activity was detected in the fractions of 5000 to 8000 Da. These results indicate that hairy cells from HCL patients with PPH secrete a factor inducing IgG synthesis, and that the induction of IgG synthesis by the factor requires T-B cell interactions involving T cell receptor/CD3 complex and MHC class II antigens. This factor may play an important role in the development of PPH.","['Nakamura, Y', 'Machii, T', 'Tokumine, Y', 'Inoue, R', 'Shibano, M', 'Nojima, J', 'Kimura, F', 'Toyama, K', 'Kitani, T']","['Nakamura Y', 'Machii T', 'Tokumine Y', 'Inoue R', 'Shibano M', 'Nojima J', 'Kimura F', 'Toyama K', 'Kitani T']","['Department of Clinical Research, Osaka University, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Clin Immunol Immunopathol,Clinical immunology and immunopathology,0356637,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/cytology', 'Cell Communication', 'Cytokines/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hypergammaglobulinemia/complications/immunology', 'Immunoglobulin G/*biosynthesis/blood', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/complications/*immunology/*pathology', 'Leukocytes/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology']",1993/03/01 00:00,1993/03/01 00:01,['1993/03/01 00:00'],"['1993/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0090122983710275 [pii]', '10.1006/clin.1993.1027 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Immunol Immunopathol. 1993 Mar;66(3):212-8. doi: 10.1006/clin.1993.1027.,,,,,,,,,,

DNA single-strand breaks (SSB), DNA-DNA interstrand cross-links (DIC), DNA-protein cross-links (DPC), and DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) were measured by alkaline and neutral elution. After i.p. injection of 50 mg/kg CP, DIC were detectable at 1 h and peaked at 8 h. DPC were detectable at 2 h and peaked at 6 h. Both DIC and DPC persisted at a relatively high level until 28 h. Dose-response curves for both DIC and DPC were determined at 4 h after CP injection over the dose range of 25-150 mg/kg. These doses ranged from the minimally effective dose to doses curative for rats bearing this leukemia (1- to 9-log kill of leukemia cells). No SSB or DSB was observed at 4 h after CP injection over the dose range of 15-250 mg/kg, but a low level of SSB was observed at 18-28 h after CP treatment. These data suggest that the cytotoxic effect of CP in vivo is mediated mostly by DIC and DPC. SSB appearing late after CP injection in vivo may be a reflection of repair of DIC and DPC and an indication of the optimal timing for administration of DNA-repair inhibitors. This observation is of interest since our earlier work demonstrated that hydroxyurea can potentiate the therapeutic benefit of CP in this model when it is given over the 4-day period immediately after CP treatment.","['Wang, J Y', 'Prorok, G', 'Vaughan, W P']","['Wang JY', 'Prorok G', 'Vaughan WP']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha 68198-5130.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cross-Linking Reagents)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA, Single-Stranded)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*toxicity', 'Cross-Linking Reagents/toxicity', 'Cyclophosphamide/*toxicity', '*DNA Damage', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'DNA, Single-Stranded/*drug effects', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy', 'Radioisotope Dilution Technique', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred BN', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Time Factors']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00686152 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 1993;31(5):381-6. doi: 10.1007/BF00686152.,,,,,,,,['R01 CA455329/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,

However, breast cancer remains a leading cause of death because of increasing incidence. Potential causes for the increase in both these diseases in women will be explored. An exciting development in recent years has been the clarification of the role of oncogenes in carcinogenesis. It appears that some cancers require multiple sequential mutations for malignant transformation to occur. This may be the model for the study of carcinogenesis. These developments in molecular genetics have important implications in screening, diagnosis, prevention, and in treatment strategies. We may be witnessing the beginning of the era of cell differentiation therapy. Retinoids have a potential for impacting on the treatment of neoplasms such as promyelocytic leukemia and oropharyngeal cancers.

METHODS: A recent case of LCH seen at the University of Minnesota in combination with acute lymphoblastic leukemia led the authors to review their own charts from 1960 onward, in addition to the literature for other reported associations of LCH and malignant neoplasms. RESULTS: In addition to the presented case and 3 cases from the files of the authors, the literature contained 87 reported cases. Of the 91 patients, 39 had LCH with malignant lymphoma (ML); 25 of these cases were Hodgkin disease. In 11 of these 39 patients, the LCH was diagnosed from 12 months to 33 years after the ML was diagnosed. In 62% of the patients with LCH-ML (24 patients), the diagnosis was made concurrently and the Langerhans cells were found in the same lymph nodes. In the remaining four patients, the diagnosis of LCH preceded that of ML by 6-24 months. In 22 patients, including 2 patients in the files of the authors, LCH was reported in association with leukemia; 16 (73%) of these cases were associated with acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia. In two cases the leukemia preceded the LCH. In 6 patients both diagnoses were made concurrently, and in 14 patients (64%) the diagnosis of LCH preceded the diagnosis of leukemia by 8 months to 17 years. In the remaining 30 patients, LCH was associated with a variety of solid tumors, including a lung carcinoma in 12 patients. In all of these 12 cases the LCH was confined to the lung, and in 75% (9 of 12) of patients the diagnoses were made concurrently. In the 16 patients in whom the LCH preceded the solid tumor, the malignant diseases in 69% (11 of 16) developed within the radiation field used for the treatment of the LCH. CONCLUSIONS: The intimate and simultaneous association of LCH with ML and lung carcinomas suggests strongly that the process that leads to the association is a reactive one. However, in the patients with leukemia and the other solid tumors, the latency of the malignant neoplasm after the diagnosis of LCH is suggestive of a therapy-related process.","['Egeler, R M', 'Neglia, J P', 'Puccetti, D M', 'Brennan, C A', 'Nesbit, M E']","['Egeler RM', 'Neglia JP', 'Puccetti DM', 'Brennan CA', 'Nesbit ME']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Minnesota School of Medicine, Minneapolis 55455.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Histiocytosis, Langerhans-Cell/*complications', 'Hodgkin Disease/complications', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*complications', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications']",1993/02/01 00:00,1993/02/01 00:01,['1993/02/01 00:00'],"['1993/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19930201)71:3<865::aid-cncr2820710334>3.0.co;2-0 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1993 Feb 1;71(3):865-73. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19930201)71:3<865::aid-cncr2820710334>3.0.co;2-0.,57,,,,,,,,,

A population-based cohort study.,745-50,"BACKGROUND: Elevated risk of cancers of the stomach, colon, and buccal cavity, as well as of lymphoma and leukemia, have been reported for patients with pernicious anemia in case reports and hospital-based and cross-sectional studies. METHODS: A cohort of 2021 men and 2496 women living in the Uppsala health care region in Sweden, discharged with a hospital diagnosis of pernicious anemia from 1965 to 1983, was followed for 20 years for subsequent risk of cancer. RESULTS: A total of 553 cancers were diagnosed among these patients, significantly more than expected based on cancer standardized incidence rates (SIRs) in the general population (SIR = 1.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2-1.5). Most prominent were excesses for cancer of the stomach (SIR = 2.9; 95% CI, 2.4-3.5), esophagus (SIR = 3.2; 95% CI, 1.8-5.2), and pancreas (SIR = 1.7; 95% CI, 1.2-2.4) among men and women; myeloid leukemia among men (SIR = 4.4; 95% CI, 1.8-5.2); and multiple myeloma among women (SIR = 2.5; 95% CI, 1.1-4.9). An excess of gastric carcinoid tumors also was evident in this cohort. The risk of stomach cancer was highest in the first year after diagnosis of pernicious anemia (SIR = 7.4; 95% CI, 5.3-10.1), but an increased risk persisted throughout the follow-up period. The risk of esophageal cancer also remained elevated throughout the study period, although the risk of pancreatic cancer dropped off after 5 years. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms the excess risk of gastric carcinoma and carcinoid tumors associated with pernicious anemia, and suggests that the susceptibility state may extend to esophageal and other cancers.","['Hsing, A W', 'Hansson, L E', 'McLaughlin, J K', 'Nyren, O', 'Blot, W J', 'Ekbom, A', 'Fraumeni, J F Jr']","['Hsing AW', 'Hansson LE', 'McLaughlin JK', 'Nyren O', 'Blot WJ', 'Ekbom A', 'Fraumeni JF Jr']","['Division of Cancer Etiology, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Aged', 'Anemia, Pernicious/complications/*epidemiology', 'Cohort Studies', 'Esophageal Neoplasms/epidemiology/etiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Prospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Stomach Neoplasms/epidemiology/etiology', 'Sweden/epidemiology']",1993/02/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1993/02/01 00:00'],"['1993/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1993/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19930201)71:3<745::aid-cncr2820710316>3.0.co;2-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1993 Feb 1;71(3):745-50. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19930201)71:3<745::aid-cncr2820710316>3.0.co;2-1.,,,,,,,,,,

The cellular characteristics of the neoplastic clone involved in the CLL phase and the subsequent NHL were investigated in a patient in whom Richter syndrome developed. METHODS: Cell analysis was performed with immunofluorescence, histologic analysis, DNA extraction, and Southern blot analysis. RESULTS: The separated CLL and NHL B-cells from blood and bone marrow, as well as the neoplastic cells in autopsy specimens of the organs affected by NHL, particularly the brain, were found to express the same light chain of surface immunoglobulin (SIg). The change MD-->M in the SIg heavy-chain expression and the appearance of cytoplasmic IgMk suggested isotype switching simulating that observed on the final phases of primary B-cell differentiation. This hypothesis was confirmed by Southern blot analysis of DNA from blood cells in the CLL phase and in Richter transformation, which showed that the two cell populations had identical Ig gene rearrangement. CONCLUSIONS: The NHL in the patient in this study represented a malignant progression of CLL, not a second lymphoid malignancy.","['Cofrancesco, E', 'Baldini, L', 'Ciani, A', 'Neri, A', 'Masini, T', 'Chinaglia, D', 'Cortellaro, M']","['Cofrancesco E', 'Baldini L', 'Ciani A', 'Neri A', 'Masini T', 'Chinaglia D', 'Cortellaro M']","['Istituto di Medicina Interna, University of Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Isotypes)']",IM,"['Antigens, Surface/physiology', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Bone Marrow/immunology/pathology', 'Bone Neoplasms/*etiology/immunology/pathology', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Female', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin/physiology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Isotypes/physiology', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*complications/immunology/pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/immunology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/*etiology/immunology/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*etiology/immunology/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Plasma Cells/pathology']",1993/02/01 00:00,1993/02/01 00:01,['1993/02/01 00:00'],"['1993/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19930201)71:3<741::aid-cncr2820710315>3.0.co;2-g [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1993 Feb 1;71(3):741-4. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19930201)71:3<741::aid-cncr2820710315>3.0.co;2-g.,,,['IG'],,,,,,,

RESULTS: All cases satisfied the criteria of primary GI tract lymphoma at presentation or operation. Four showed a close relationship to human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I). Those four had positive results for anti-HTLV-I antibody and positive surface markers for CD4, positive hybridization signals by ISH, and HTLV-I gene products by PCR, but they had no lymphoma cells in peripheral blood or bone marrow. The fifth case showed negative signals by ISH and PCR. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that some of the putative adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) types can be further classified as GI-tract-type lymphoma.

A second unrelated donor BMT was performed 9 months later using T cell-replete marrow from a similarly matched female donor. Grade 2 GVHD involving the skin and gut responded to treatment with steroids. Chimaerism was assessed using Y-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and microsatellites.

Following the second transplant, donor-type haematopoiesis was documented using a panel of microsatellite probes. The patient remains well 6 months after transplant. Splenectomy should be considered prior to transplant in patients with significant splenomegaly and hypersplenism. Partial chimaerism in the spleen, but not bone marrow, post-BMT, has not previously been documented.

The overall 3-year disease-free survival (DFS) probability is 38% (95% CI: 31-45%); 75 patients died of complications and 51 relapsed. Multivariate analysis identified three factors independently associated with outcome: age, remission/relapse status and patient-donor relationship. The 3-year DFS probability is 52% (41-63%) for the 106 patients aged 0-11 and 25% (16-33%) for the 104 aged 11+ years; the DFS probability was 54% (34-74%), 41% (32-49%) and 19% (5-33%) for those in first remission, later remissions and relapse respectively. Older patients suffered both more toxic deaths and more relapses than young ones. No other covariate was found to predict for outcome. The results using ara-C-TBI are similar to those achieved using cyclophosphamide plus TBI to prepare ALL patients for BMT, perhaps because a seemingly lower relapse rate is offset by more toxic deaths particularly in older patients. Therapeutic trials should focus on reducing toxicity while maximizing antileukemic efficacy, and should stratify for patient and disease-related factors.","['Weyman, C', 'Graham-Pole, J', 'Emerson, S', 'August, C', 'Champlin, R', 'Coccia, P', 'Fay, J', 'Harris, R', 'Koch, P', 'Johnson, L']","['Weyman C', 'Graham-Pole J', 'Emerson S', 'August C', 'Champlin R', 'Coccia P', 'Fay J', 'Harris R', 'Koch P', 'Johnson L', 'et al.']","['University of Florida, Gainesville.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*methods', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytarabine/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/mortality/*surgery', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1993 Jan;11(1):43-50.,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The case records of 102 patients receiving combination chemotherapy for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (intermediate to high-grade histology) were reviewed. Patients were considered to have ""laboratory tumor lysis"" if two of the following metabolic changes occurred within 4 days of treatment: a 25% increase in the serum phosphate, potassium, uric acid, or urea nitrogen concentrations, or a 25% decline in the serum calcium concentration. ""Clinical tumor lysis"" was defined as laboratory tumor lysis plus one of the following: a serum potassium level greater than 6 mmol/L, a creatinine level greater than 221 mumol/L, or a calcium level less than 1.5 mmol/L, the development of a life-threatening arrhythmia, or sudden death. RESULTS: Laboratory tumor lysis occurred in 42% of patients and clinical tumor lysis in 6%. There was no statistical difference in the frequency of either tumor lysis syndrome among lymphoma subgroups. Clinical tumor lysis occurred more frequently in patients with pretreatment renal insufficiency (serum creatinine level greater than 132 mumol/L) than in patients with normal renal function (36% versus 2%; p = 0.01). The development of azotemia correlated with high pretreatment serum lactate dehydrogenase concentrations (p < 0.01; r2 = 0.11). CONCLUSION: Clinically significant tumor lysis is a rare occurrence in patients with lymphoma when they are receiving allopurinol. However, tumor lysis can occur in patients with all types of moderate to high-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Patients with a high serum lactate dehydrogenase level or renal insufficiency are at increased risk for metabolic complications after chemotherapy and should be closely monitored.","['Hande, K R', 'Garrow, G C']","['Hande KR', 'Garrow GC']","['Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Am J Med,The American journal of medicine,0267200,"['0 (Phosphates)', '268B43MJ25 (Uric Acid)', '63CZ7GJN5I (Allopurinol)', 'AYI8EX34EU (Creatinine)', 'EC 1.1.1.27 (L-Lactate Dehydrogenase)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Allopurinol/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects', 'Blood Urea Nitrogen', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/blood/drug therapy', 'Creatinine/blood', 'Humans', 'Hyperkalemia/etiology', 'Hypocalcemia/etiology', 'L-Lactate Dehydrogenase/blood', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/drug therapy', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/blood/drug therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/blood/*drug therapy', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/blood/drug therapy', 'Phosphates/blood', 'Renal Insufficiency/etiology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Tumor Lysis Syndrome/blood/*etiology', 'Uric Acid/blood']",1993/02/01 00:00,1993/02/01 00:01,['1993/02/01 00:00'],"['1993/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0002-9343(93)90174-N [pii]', '10.1016/0002-9343(93)90174-n [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Med. 1993 Feb;94(2):133-9. doi: 10.1016/0002-9343(93)90174-n.,45,,,"['Am J Med. 1995 Apr;98(4):417; author reply 418.

We investigated the effects of oncostatin M on cultured rabbit aorta smooth muscle cells (SMCs) and found that the peptide stimulated an increase in the incorporation of [3H]thymidine into DNA. The magnitude of the stimulation was dependent on oncostatin M concentration and SMC confluency. In subconfluent cultures, 1-2 nM stimulated 4- to 5-fold increases in DNA synthesis after 20 hr. Other structurally related cytokines (granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, leukemia inhibitory factor, interleukin 6, ciliary neurotrophic factor) did not affect SMC DNA synthesis. After 5 or 8 days, oncostatin M caused a doubling in SMC number and also induced a transformed phenotype. The combination of oncostatin M and platelet-derived growth factor for 8 days resulted in a 4-fold increase in cell number, approximately the same increase in cell number as induced by the addition of 10% fetal calf serum. Further investigation suggested that the mitogenic effect of oncostatin M was in part due to tyrosine kinase activation. Within 1-2 min, the factor increased phosphotyrosine levels of several SMC proteins. In addition, detectable increases in diacylglycerol levels occurred within 2-5 min, reached 50% above control by 30 min, and remained elevated through 45 min of incubation with oncostatin M. SMC inositol phosphate levels were also elevated within 2 min and then returned to near control values by 20 min. Within 30 min, oncostatin M induced expression of the immediate-early gene EGR-1. These data indicate that oncostatin M may be an important, naturally occurring mitogen for vascular SMCs.","['Grove, R I', 'Eberhardt, C', 'Abid, S', 'Mazzucco, C', 'Liu, J', 'Kiener, P', 'Todaro, G', 'Shoyab, M']","['Grove RI', 'Eberhardt C', 'Abid S', 'Mazzucco C', 'Liu J', 'Kiener P', 'Todaro G', 'Shoyab M']","['Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceutical Research Institute, Seattle, WA 98121.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Mitogens)', '0 (Muscle Proteins)', '0 (Peptides)', '106956-32-5 (Oncostatin M)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Aorta/cytology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytokines/*pharmacology', 'Mitogens/*pharmacology', 'Muscle Development', 'Muscle Proteins/metabolism', 'Muscle, Smooth, Vascular/*drug effects/growth & development', 'Oncostatin M', 'Peptides/*pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', 'Rabbits']",1993/02/01 00:00,1993/02/01 00:01,['1993/02/01 00:00'],"['1993/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.90.3.823 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1993 Feb 1;90(3):823-7. doi: 10.1073/pnas.90.3.823.,,,,,PMC45762,,,,,

To determine the clinical importance of this property, we measured the uptake of tritiated thymidine by leukemic cells in serum-free and cytokine-free cultures as a means of determining the rate of spontaneous proliferation in 114 patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia. Proliferation was then classified according to three quantitative levels of activity and related to overall survival and to treatment outcome (the response to treatment, the actuarial probability of relapse, and disease-free survival) in 91 patients who were treated with chemotherapy to induce remission. RESULTS: Of the 114 patients, 37 had low, 39 had intermediate, and 38 had high levels of proliferation. The probability of survival at three years was 36 percent among patients with low levels of proliferative activity and 3 percent among those with high levels (P < 0.001). Among the patients treated with chemotherapy, those with low rates of proliferative activity had a 68 percent rate of complete remission and a 49 percent probability of remaining free of relapse, whereas those with high rates of proliferative activity had only a 39 percent rate of complete remission (P = 0.04) and an 11 percent probability of remaining in complete remission (P = 0.009). The probability of disease-free survival at three years among the patients in complete remission after chemotherapy was 49 percent among those with low rates of proliferative activity and 9 percent among those with high rates (P = 0.004). Accordingly, patients with low rates of proliferative activity also had a significantly higher rate of overall survival (44 percent vs. 4 percent; P = 0.002). Patients whose cells had intermediate levels of proliferation in vitro had intermediate rates of survival, relapse, and disease-free survival.

Unfortunately, only 25 to 30 percent of potential recipients have HLA-identical siblings who can act as donors. In 1986 the National Marrow Donor Program was created in the United States to facilitate the finding and procurement of suitable marrow from unrelated donors for patients lacking related donors. RESULTS: During the first four years of the program, 462 patients with acquired and congenital lymphohematopoietic disorders or metabolic diseases received marrow transplants from unrelated donors. The probability of engraftment by 100 days after transplantation was 94 percent, although 8 percent of patients later had secondary graft failure. The probability of grade II, III, or IV acute graft-versus-host disease was 64 percent, and the probability of chronic graft-versus-host disease at one year was 55 percent. The rate of disease-free survival at two years among patients with leukemia and good prognostic factors was 40 percent and among patients at higher risk, 19 percent. Twenty-nine percent of the patients with aplastic anemia were alive at two years, and the rate of two-year disease-free survival among patients with myelodysplasia was 18 percent. For patients with congenital immunologic or nonimmunologic disorders, the probability of survival was 52 percent. CONCLUSIONS: The National Marrow Donor Program has benefited a substantial number of patients in need of marrow transplants from closely HLA-matched unrelated donors and has facilitated the recruitment of unrelated donors into the donor pool and the access to suitable marrow.","['Kernan, N A', 'Bartsch, G', 'Ash, R C', 'Beatty, P G', 'Champlin, R', 'Filipovich, A', 'Gajewski, J', 'Hansen, J A', 'Henslee-Downey, J', 'McCullough, J']","['Kernan NA', 'Bartsch G', 'Ash RC', 'Beatty PG', 'Champlin R', 'Filipovich A', 'Gajewski J', 'Hansen JA', 'Henslee-Downey J', 'McCullough J', 'et al.']","['Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10021.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,N Engl J Med,The New England journal of medicine,0255562,['0 (HLA Antigens)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anemia, Aplastic/surgery', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects/*statistics & numerical data', 'Cause of Death', 'Child', 'Data Collection', 'Female', 'Graft Survival', 'Graft vs Host Disease', 'HLA Antigens/analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Survival Rate', 'Tissue Donors/*statistics & numerical data', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'United States']",1993/03/04 00:00,1993/03/04 00:01,['1993/03/04 00:00'],"['1993/03/04 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/03/04 00:01 [medline]', '1993/03/04 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1056/NEJM199303043280901 [doi]'],ppublish,N Engl J Med. 1993 Mar 4;328(9):593-602. doi: 10.1056/NEJM199303043280901.,,,,['N Engl J Med. 1993 Jul 29;329(5):362-3.

The present experiments tested whether deoxycytidine, by replenishing dCTP pools, could prevent thymidine cytotoxicity and thymidine's enhancement of carboplatin killing in two human T-cell acute leukemia cell lines. MOLT3 and JM cells were exposed to combinations of thymidine, deoxycytidine, and carboplatin and then assessed for survival, the magnitude of thymidine-carboplatin chemosensitization, and changes in deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate pools. For both cell lines, deoxycytidine (up to 144.5 micrograms/ml x 24 h) completely restored dCTP pools but only partially protected against thymidine cytotoxicity (100-1000 micrograms/ml x 24 h) and thymidine-carboplatin sensitization (up to 60 micrograms carboplatin/ml during the last hour of thymidine). This contrasts with complete protection in prior studies using other cell types. Thymidine alone markedly increased dTTP and dGTP pools and decreased dCTP; dATP pools underwent a sharp decline which has not been observed before in any cell line. In subsequent studies 0.0336-137.3 micrograms deoxyadenosine/ml partially prevented cytotoxicity and carboplatin sensitization by 300 micrograms thymidine/ml. Together, deoxycytidine and deoxyadenosine completely prevented thymidine-carboplatin sensitization even though dATP and dCTP pools were not entirely returned to normal. These findings are discussed in regard to the unusual sensitivity of T-cell malignancies to thymidine toxicity, mechanisms of cytotoxicity and chemosensitization by thymidine, and the possibility of thymidine selectively sensitizing T-cell malignancies to killing by alkylating agents.","['Cohen, J D', 'Robins, H I', 'Katz, T B', 'Miller, E M', 'Kuzminsky, S R', 'Javid, M J']","['Cohen JD', 'Robins HI', 'Katz TB', 'Miller EM', 'Kuzminsky SR', 'Javid MJ']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology, Denver Veterans Administration Medical Center, CO 80220.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Deoxyadenosines)', '0 (Deoxyribonucleotides)', '0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)', 'BG3F62OND5 (Carboplatin)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",IM,"['Carboplatin/administration & dosage', 'Deoxyadenosines/metabolism', 'Deoxycytidine/metabolism', 'Deoxyribonucleotides/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*metabolism/pathology', 'Thymidine/metabolism/*toxicity', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1993/02/01 00:00,1993/02/01 00:01,['1993/02/01 00:00'],"['1993/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0145-2126(93)90062-P [pii]', '10.1016/0145-2126(93)90062-p [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1993 Feb;17(2):167-74. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(93)90062-p.,,,,,,,,['P01 CA20432-13/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,

A total of 114 patients with these aggressive types of ATL were newly diagnosed at our institution from 1975 to 1989. By multivariate analysis, poor performance status and high serum creatine levels were associated with shortened survival. With combination chemotherapy, 20 patients achieved complete remission (CR), 53 achieved partial remission (PR) and 35 showed no response. Fifteen of the CR or PR patients survived for more than two years and all other patients survived for less than two years. As compared with short survivors (< 2 years) after remission, long survivors (> or = 2 years) after remission had a higher CR/PR ratio, a longer time until remission and a higher doxorubicin dose to achieve remission. Death due to causes other than the primary disease occurred in 18% of short survivors after remission and in 11.2% of nonresponders, but in none of the long survivors. Long survivors with acute ATL included 6 patients with CR and 5 patients with PR. All four lymphoma type ATL long survivors achieved CR. Monoclonal integration of HTLV-I provirus was detected in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of all 3 PR long survivors with acute ATL studied, but was not detected in all 4 CR cases studied at remission. The minimum CD4/CD8 ratio of peripheral mononuclear cells at remission was < 1.0 in all acute ATL long survivors with CR, and was > 1.0 in all acute ATL long survivors with PR. Three out of six acute ATL long survivors with CR developed suspected viral infection just before achieving CR.

Cells were incubated for 3 days in the presence of various concentrations of carboplatin and other drugs and cell growth inhibition was determined by MTT assay. The antitumor effects of the drug combinations at ID50 were analyzed using an improved isobologram. In MOLT-3 cells, supra-additive (synergistic) effects were observed for carboplatin in combination with cytosine arabinoside, mitoxantrone and CPT-11. Additive effects were observed for combinations of carboplatin with bleomycin, daunorubicin, doxorubicin, etoposide, 6-mercaptopurine, and vincristine.

Synergistic or antagonistic effects for combinations of carboplatin and CPT-11, cytosine arabinoside, mitoxantrone and methotrexate were also observed in HL-60 cells. These findings suggest that carboplatin has additive or synergistic cytotoxic effects with most of the agents tested. Determination of the usefulness of these drug combinations awaits appropriate in vivo experiments that should assess both tumorcidal effects and possible increased toxicity.

In the present study we have examined the cellular localization and secretion of TGF-beta in B-cells from normal donors and patients with CLL and have assessed the influence of TGF-beta 1 on DNA synthesis in these cells. Using anti-LC(1-30)--a polyclonal anti-TGF-beta 1 antibody--TGF-beta was localized to discrete sites within the cytoplasm of both normal and malignant lymphocytes. These areas co-localized with areas detected by an antigranule antibody (D545), suggesting that TGF-beta may be stored within cytoplasmic secretory vesicles. Both normal B- and CLL cells contained low or undetectable levels of TGF-beta mRNA and secreted low and equivalent amounts of TGF-beta. Compared to untreated cells, DNA synthesis was reduced by TGF-beta 1 to a mean +/- S. E. of 0.84 +/- 0.07 in CLL cells and this was significantly less (p < 0.001) than that observed in normal B-cells (mean +/- S. E. of control, 0.12 +/- 0.02). In 3 of the 18 patients, TGF-beta 1 stimulated DNA synthesis. The reduced inhibition of leukemic cell DNA synthesis by TGF-beta 1 in CLL may provide these cells with a growth or survival advantage over normal lymphocytes and contribute to their selective accumulation.","['Israels, L G', 'Israels, S J', 'Begleiter, A', 'Verburg, L', 'Schwartz, L', 'Mowat, M R', 'Johnston, J B']","['Israels LG', 'Israels SJ', 'Begleiter A', 'Verburg L', 'Schwartz L', 'Mowat MR', 'Johnston JB']","['Manitoba Institute of Cell Biology, Manitoba Cancer Treatment and Research Foundation, Winnipeg, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)']",IM,"['DNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphocytes/chemistry', 'Male', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/analysis/metabolism/*pharmacology']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0145-2126(93)90144-A [pii]', '10.1016/0145-2126(93)90144-a [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1993 Jan;17(1):81-7. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(93)90144-a.,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, their antitumor efficacy was markedly potentiated by recombinant human IFN-alpha. The combination of ITs and IFN-alpha effectively killed the tumor in the majority of the treated mice; 9 of the 12 treated mice survived tumor-free for as long as they were followed, i.e. for 140 days. Two different ITs, SN1-ricin A chain (RA) and SN2-RA, were used together to minimize the problem of tumor heterogeneity; monoclonal antibodies SN1 and SN2 are directed toward two different human T-leukemia associated cell surface antigens. In the biodistribution experiments, the paired label technique was used to include a reliable internal control. In an experiment, equal amounts of 125I-SN1-RA and 131I-labelled isotype-matching control IgG (IgG1-kappa)-RA were mixed and administered i.v. into tumor-bearing nude mice. In a separate experiment, a mixture of equal amounts of 125I-SN2-RA and 131I-control IgG-RA was administered i.v. This technique allowed us to distinguish the immunospecific uptake from the non-immunospecific uptake of ITs into individual organs. The present results clearly show that both SN1-RA and SN2-RA are specifically localized in tumors after systemic administration. For instance, 24 h after the administration of a radiolabelled mixture, the ratio of 125I/131I in the tumor was 7.0 and 23.5, respectively, for the SN1-RA/control IgG-RA mixture and the SN2-RA/control IgG-RA mixture. Such high ratios of 125I/131I were detected in the tumors throughout the experiments between 30 min and 24 h after the administration of the paired label mixture.","['Yokota, S', 'Okazaki, M', 'Yoshida, M', 'Seon, B K']","['Yokota S', 'Okazaki M', 'Yoshida M', 'Seon BK']","['Department of Molecular Immunology, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, NY 14263.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (Iodine Radioisotopes)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '9009-86-3 (Ricin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/therapeutic use', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunotoxins/metabolism/*therapeutic use', 'Interferon Type I/*therapeutic use', 'Iodine Radioisotopes', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/immunology/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Ricin/*therapeutic use', 'Tissue Distribution', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0145-2126(93)90143-9 [pii]', '10.1016/0145-2126(93)90143-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1993 Jan;17(1):69-79. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(93)90143-9.,,,,,,,,['CA16056/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,

PER-423 cells express the p75 (beta) subunit of the IL-2 receptor (IL-2R beta), while the p55 chain (IL-2R alpha) is not detectable by immunofluorescence. The analysis of the IL-2R revealed that it is of intermediate affinity and the median effective IL-2 concentration for PER-423 cells (EC50 value) was determined to be 1.44 +/- 0.29 nM. Chemical crosslinking studies showed that the receptor consists of one polypeptide of approximately 95 kDa as well as a doublet of 70 kDa and 60 kDa and does not include the IL-2R alpha-chain. The steady-state mRNA level for the p75 subunit was similar to that present in a cell line expressing an IL-2R alpha+ beta+, while only traces for the alpha-chain were detectable. PER-423 cells can be induced to express the alpha-chain of the IL-2R on the cell surface, concomitant with a much reduced EC50 level.

Following multiple DMBA injections, CFU-S number and PF were decreased whereas CR and td increased, thus indicating persisting stem cell injury and proliferative compensation in the hemopoietic amplification compartment. A single DMBA injection had no effect. It is concluded that a first DMBA injection induces cytotoxic (and genotoxic) damage in the bone marrow leading simultaneously to a strong proliferation stimulus and a hindered proliferation ability of HSC, some of which will be predisposed for further mutagenic treatment.

The dipeptide derivatives (42-47, 60, and 61) were first evaluated in vivo for their anticancer activities against the murine lymphocytic leukemia P388. Compounds 42, 44, 46, and 60 possessed activities ranging from 46 to 111 percent increase in life span (%ILS), whereas 43 was marginal (%ILS = 31) and 45, 47, and 61 were inactive. In general, the L,L-series exhibited low to good activity (%ILS = 46-111), whereas the corresponding D, D-series, except for 43 (%ILS = 31), was devoid of activity. The analogously structured monoamino acid derivatives of L-alanine (74), L-phenylalanine (75), and L-aspartic acid (76) exhibited higher activity against P388 than the dipeptide derivatives (i.e., 481, 297, and 481 %ILS, respectively). The more active representatives of dipeptides (i.e., 42, 44, and 60) and the amino acids derivatives 74-76 were then tested in vivo against the murine lymphoid leukemia L1210.

We compared the dynamics to those of asymptomatic HTLV-I carriers (AC). The estimation of the amount of HTLV-I proviral DNA was carried out by quantitative polymerase chain reaction of serially diluted DNA samples where it was feasible to titrate 0.04-80 copies per 100 PBMC. The proviral DNA quantified in six patients with HAM/TSP was 2-20 copies per 100 PBMC, while that in eight cases of AC was 0.04-8 copies per 100 PBMC. Thus, the amount of HTLV-I proviral DNA in HAM/TSP patients was 3-50 times as high as that of AC. When we followed up HAM/TSP patients for 1-3 years, the amount of HTLV-I proviral DNA fluctuated from 4 to 10-fold. These data suggest that the rate of HTLV-I replication increases in HAM/TSP and the amount of HTLV-I proviral DNA fluctuates in their clinical course.

We have used site-directed mutagenesis and DNA-protein binding assays to define the active motifs of this epsilon-globin silencer. DNase I foot-printing of the silencer region with K562 cell nuclear extracts defined a sequence, which we designate as the epsilon-globin silencer motif or epsilon GSM (epsilon -278 to -258 base pairs (bp)) containing a region (epsilon -270 to -258) with 90% homology to the yeast mating type silencer, ABF-1 (autonomous replicating sequence binding factor one) and which also overlaps at (epsilon -269 to -262) with the human YY1 consensus sequence, an element which mediates transcription repression and activation of viral, mouse, and human genes. The DNase I footprint extended 5' in the silencer region to include an inverted repeat of a six-nucleotide motif (epsilon -267 to -278 bp) which shares 5 of 6 bases with the GATA-1 consensus sequence. In gel mobility shift assays, two specific proteins (A and B) in nuclear extracts from erythroleukemia K562 cells bound to the DNase I-footprinted region. Protein B, associated with epsilon-globin silencer activity in vitro, required an intact epsilon GSM sequence for binding. Mutation of 5 bases within the epsilon GSM in an epsilon-globin promoter-containing fragment extending upstream to 1400 bp in transient transfection assays increased activity by 3.0-fold compared with the native sequence, suggesting that the silencer activity was mediated by the epsilon GSM sequence. We found that protein A could be displaced by a competitor containing the GATA-1 consensus sequence, suggesting that protein A is a GATA-like protein. The region from -267 to -271 within the epsilon GSM and GATA-1 homology region was important for binding of both proteins A and B. These data suggest that protein binding to the epsilon GSM and GATA motifs mediate the negative effect of the silencer on transcription, possibly via direct competition for binding to this DNA region. Recombinant yeast ABF-1 and human YY1 bound to the epsilon GSM. Mutating three bases (epsilon -259, -262, -264) in the epsilon GSM decreased the binding affinity of protein B and recombinant human YY1 but increased the binding affinity of recombinant yeast ABF-1.

In addition to their microbicidal effect, it has recently been suggested that reactive oxygen species play a role as intracellular messengers. The mechanism of action remains unknown, but peroxides have been reported to increase tyrosine phosphorylation, an effect potentiated by vanadate. In this report we studied the effects of a combination of H2O2 and vanadate on Ca2+ homeostasis in granulocytic HL60 cells. The peroxides induced a transient elevation of cytosolic [Ca2+] associated with release from internal stores. Ca2+ mobilization was accompanied by increased generation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, implicating phospholipase C (PLC). A sizable increase in phosphotyrosine accumulation by several polypeptides in the M(r) 20,000 to 250,000 range preceded the [Ca2+] changes. We therefore considered the possibility that tyrosine phosphorylation of a phospholipase mediates the observed effects. Differentiated (granulocytic) HL60 cells did not have detectable levels of PLC gamma 1 but had substantial PLC gamma 2. Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting experiments demonstrated that PLC gamma 2 becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated upon treatment of the cells with peroxides of vanadate. If associated with activation, such phosphorylation of PLC gamma 2 can account for the rise in [Ca2+]. Although capable of mobilizing internal Ca2+ stores, the peroxides failed to produce the sustained [Ca2+] increase predicted by the ""capacitative"" model. Mn2+ influx determinations indicated that this is due to impairment of divalent cation entry by the peroxides, uncoupling the plasma membrane from the internal stores. Changes in [Ca2+] homeostasis could mediate some of the messenger actions of reactive oxygen species.","['Bianchini, L', 'Todderud, G', 'Grinstein, S']","['Bianchini L', 'Todderud G', 'Grinstein S']","['Division of Cell Biology, Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Terpenes)', '0 (pervanadate)', '3WHH0066W5 (Vanadates)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', '42Z2K6ZL8P (Manganese)', '59880-97-6 (N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine)', '67526-95-8 (Thapsigargin)', '85166-31-0 (Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate)', 'EC 3.1.4.- (Type C Phospholipases)', 'EC 7.2.2.10 (Calcium-Transporting ATPases)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Calcium-Transporting ATPases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Cytosol/metabolism', 'Homeostasis', 'Humans', 'Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate/metabolism', 'Isoenzymes/*metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Manganese/pharmacology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine/pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Terpenes/pharmacology', 'Thapsigargin', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Type C Phospholipases/*metabolism', '*Tyrosine', 'Vanadates/pharmacology']",1993/02/15 00:00,1993/02/15 00:01,['1993/02/15 00:00'],"['1993/02/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/02/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/02/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(18)53702-9 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1993 Feb 15;268(5):3357-63.,,,,,,,,,,

Several viral transcriptional activator proteins have been shown to directly contact TBP, the TATA box-binding subunit of the general initiation factor, TFIID. In this report, we use protein affinity chromatography to show that the cellular transcription factor, p53, interacts directly and specifically with yeast TBP. The TBP binding domain of p53 was localized to its N-terminal 73 amino acids. This highly acidic portion of p53 functions as a transcriptional activation domain and is deleted in some tumors induced by the Friend leukemia virus. A human tumor-derived oncogenic point mutation of p53, which lies outside the activation domain of p53, but reduces its ability to activate transcription, greatly reduced the ability of p53 to bind yeast TBP in vitro. This mutation probably affects the overall conformation of the protein and indirectly interferes with the ability of p53 to contact TBP and activate transcription. In contrast, a mutated oncogenic form of p53 that is unaffected in its ability to activate transcription bound yeast TBP as well as wild type p53. The human TBP activity in a HeLa extract also bound to the activation domain of p53. Our data support a general model in which DNA-bound activator proteins activate transcription by interacting with TBP.","['Truant, R', 'Xiao, H', 'Ingles, C J', 'Greenblatt, J']","['Truant R', 'Xiao H', 'Ingles CJ', 'Greenblatt J']","['Banting and Best Institute of Medical Research, University of Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Fungal Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (TATA-Box Binding Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",IM,"['DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Fungal Proteins/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'TATA Box', 'TATA-Box Binding Protein', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*metabolism']",1993/02/05 00:00,1993/02/05 00:01,['1993/02/05 00:00'],"['1993/02/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/02/05 00:01 [medline]', '1993/02/05 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(18)53769-8 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1993 Feb 5;268(4):2284-7.,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study we found that, in normal cell-culture conditions in 10% FCS the plasminogen activation cascade works continuously on monocytoid leukemia cells, which expressed plasmin activity and active u-PA on their cell surface. This plasmin catalyzed the conversion of the produced pro-u-PA to active 2-chain urokinase (tcu-PA), and was derived from bovine serum plasminogen by the activity of cell-bound tcu-PA. Plasmin generation was abolished and pro-u-PA accumulated in cell cultures that were grown for several days, either in the presence of serum thoroughly depleted of plasminogen, or in the presence of 1 mM tranexamic acid. Plasmin generated on the cell surface was found to be present in 2 enzymatically active fragments, of M(r) 85,000 and M(r) 50,000, which were slowly released into the growth medium. These fragments could activate pro-u-PA in serum-free growth medium.

This compound had a Ki of 90 pM versus human thymidylate synthase and was noncompetitive with (6R,S)-5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate. It was a good substrate for the addition of the second glutamate by hog liver folylpolyglutamate synthetase, having a Vmax/Km value 7.8-fold higher than (6R,S)-tetrahydrofolate. The data indicate that 1843U89 was transported into cells via the reduced folate carrier. The Kt for 1843U89 in MOLT-4 cells was 0.33 microM, which was 3-fold lower than that for methotrexate and 16-fold lower than that for (6S-5-formyltetrahydrofolate. V/K values were 20.3 for 1843U89 versus 1.2 and 1.9 for methotrexate and (6S)-5-formyltetrahydrofolate, respectively. It was a potent inhibitor of the growth of human cells, having 50% inhibitory concentrations below 1 nM for all cell lines tested. Growth inhibition was reversed by thymidine alone, indicating that thymidylate synthase was the only site of action of this compound. Growth inhibition was not affected by (6R,S-5-formyltetrahydrofolate at concentrations below 5 microM. However, the 50% inhibitory concentration increased when the concentration in the medium was increased to 100 microM, presumably due to competition for transport. Relative to the human cell lines used, murine cell lines were 80-1300-fold less sensitive to 1843U89 and the other benzoquinazolines tested. This decreased sensitivity appeared to be due, at least in part, to decreased transport or accumulation in murine cells. Ki values for inhibition of methotrexate transport for the benzoquinazolines were 5-17-fold higher in L1210 cells than in MOLT-4 cells. 1843U89, the benzoquinazoline which was transported most efficiently and which was the most potent inhibitor of the growth of human cells, exhibited the largest difference between binding to the MOLT-4 human and L1210 murine transporter. The V/K for L1210 transport was 80-fold less than that for MOLT-4. Initial antitumor studies, using the human thymidine kinase-deficient line GC3TK- to circumvent problems associated with murine transport as well as the high circulating thymidine levels in mice, indicated that 1843U89 had marked in vivo antitumor activity.","['Duch, D S', 'Banks, S', 'Dev, I K', 'Dickerson, S H', 'Ferone, R', 'Heath, L S', 'Humphreys, J', 'Knick, V', 'Pendergast, W', 'Singer, S']","['Duch DS', 'Banks S', 'Dev IK', 'Dickerson SH', 'Ferone R', 'Heath LS', 'Humphreys J', 'Knick V', 'Pendergast W', 'Singer S', 'et al.']","['Wellcome Research Laboratories, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 27709.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Indoles)', '0 (Isoindoles)', '0 (Quinazolines)', '0 (Tetrahydrofolates)', '0SXY5ET48B (5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolic acid)', '139987-54-5 (1843U89)', 'EC 2.1.1.45 (Thymidylate Synthase)', 'Q573I9DVLP (Leucovorin)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Breast Neoplasms/*metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Colonic Neoplasms/*metabolism/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Indoles/chemistry/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Isoindoles', 'Leucovorin/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Leukemia L1210/*metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*metabolism/pathology', 'Methotrexate/metabolism', 'Quinazolines/chemistry/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Subrenal Capsule Assay', 'Tetrahydrofolates/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Thymidylate Synthase/*antagonists & inhibitors']",1993/02/15 00:00,1993/02/15 00:01,['1993/02/15 00:00'],"['1993/02/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/02/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/02/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1993 Feb 15;53(4):810-8.,,,,,,,,,,

The series included alkylformamides, alkylacetamides, alkylureas, and substituted hexyl analogues of acetamide. The biological activity studied for correlation with structure was the ability of each compound to induce differentiation of the human promyelocytic leukemia cell line, HL-60, to granulocyte-like cells. In the CoMFA study, both steric and electrostatic fields were used along with molecular weight to determine a correlation between biological activity of the compounds and their structural features. The CoMFA results indicated a linear structure-activity correlation with a high predictive value. There was almost an even contribution towards activity from steric interactions, electrostatic potential, and molecular weight. These findings confirm a previous report by Langdon and Hickman (S. P. Langdon and J. A. Hickman, Cancer Res., 47: 140-144, 1987) that the ability to induce cell differentiation is highly dependent on molecular weight. Additionally, CoMFA contour maps provided information about regions of the molecule that are favorable to increased steric bulk and electrostatic charge. CoMFA was used to predict the activities of six hexamethylene acetamide analogues: ethyl 6-acetamidohexanoate; 6-acetamidohexanol; 1,5-bis(acetamido)hexane; 6-acetamidohexanonitrile; 6-acetamidohexanoic acid; and caprolactam. Although the model incorrectly predicted high activity for 6-acetamidohexanoic acid, the predicted activities for the remaining compounds were 0.3 to 1.5 times that of the corresponding experimental activities, which is comparable to the results obtained from other published CoMFA studies.","['Harpalani, A D', 'Snyder, S W', 'Subramanyam, B', 'Egorin, M J', 'Callery, P S']","['Harpalani AD', 'Snyder SW', 'Subramanyam B', 'Egorin MJ', 'Callery PS']","['Department of Biomedicinal Chemistry, School of Pharmacy, University of Maryland, Baltimore 21201.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,['0 (Oligopeptides)'],IM,"['Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Computer Graphics', 'Humans', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*pathology', 'Oligopeptides/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/02/15 00:00,1993/02/15 00:01,['1993/02/15 00:00'],"['1993/02/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/02/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/02/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1993 Feb 15;53(4):766-71.,,,,,,,,,,

This region binds an inducible, T-cell-specific factor over its 5' end, a site that is necessary for the expression of IL-3 in the absence of other upstream elements. Over its 3' end, it binds a factor that is ubiquitously and constitutively expressed. This factor is Oct-1 or an immunologically related octamer-binding protein, and it plays a role in coordinating the activity of several regulatory elements. These characteristics make the ACT-1 site analogous to the activating ARRE-1 site in the IL-2 promoter.

Selected genomic DNA probes from chromosome 21 and from chromosome 8 near the breakpoint junction detect rearrangements in the DNA of about 80% of the patients with the rearrangement at diagnosis and in relapse. We analyzed the DNA of 20 patients with t(8;21) AML by standard Southern blot with probes originating from chromosomes 21 and 8 near the breakpoint junction, and we identified rearranged bands in 17 of the 20 patients at diagnosis and in relapse. We also used the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with appropriate primers from the AML1 and ETO genes to amplify the cDNAs from a cell line with the t(8;21) and from seven AML patients with the t(8;21). We detected a fused transcript in the cell line and in all of the patients analyzed, including three patients who did not show any rearrangement by Southern blot analysis and one patient in hematologic remission, who later relapsed. Combining the results from Southern blot and PCR analysis, we could detect the t(8;21) in all of the patients tested. These results indicate that, whereas several DNA probes used as genetic markers do detect the t(8;21) in most, but not all Southern blots of patients with AML, PCR amplification with primers from AML1 and ETO can be used as a more sensitive and accurate means for detecting this chromosomal abnormality, and for observing the patients' response to therapy.","['Nucifora, G', 'Birn, D J', 'Erickson, P', 'Gao, J', 'LeBeau, M M', 'Drabkin, H A', 'Rowley, J D']","['Nucifora G', 'Birn DJ', 'Erickson P', 'Gao J', 'LeBeau MM', 'Drabkin HA', 'Rowley JD']","['Department of Medicine, University of Chicago, IL.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 3.1.21.- (Deoxyribonuclease BamHI)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Child', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8', 'DNA Probes', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Deoxyribonuclease BamHI', 'Female', '*Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Messenger/*genetics', 'Restriction Mapping', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1993/02/15 00:00,1993/02/15 00:01,['1993/02/15 00:00'],"['1993/02/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/02/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/02/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)85104-0 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1993 Feb 15;81(4):883-8.,,,"['AML1', 'ETO']",,,,,"['5T32CA09273-14/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 42557/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01-HD017449/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States']",,

We conclude that abnormal bcl-2 gene expression influences the survival ability of B-cell progenitors.

Cellular responsiveness to retinoic acid (RA) is conferred through two distinct classes of nuclear receptors, the RA receptors (RARs) and the retinoid X receptors (RXRs). The RARs bind to both 9-cis- and all-trans-RAs, but 9-cis-RA alone directly binds and activates RXR. This suggested that 9-cis-RA could have expanded hematopoietic activities as compared with all-trans-RA. We compared the abilities of 9-cis- and all-trans-RAs to induce differentiation and inhibit proliferation of three acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) cell lines and fresh leukemic cells from 28 patients and found that: (1) 9-cis-RA in general was more potent than all-trans-RA in suppressing the clonal growth of two AML cell lines and 17 AML samples from patients, including four from individuals with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Eleven leukemic samples, including three from patients with chronic myelogenous or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, were relatively refractory to both retinoids. (2) The range of activities of both retinoids was similar except that the clonal growth of samples from three AML patients were inhibited by 9-cis-RA, but not by all-trans-RA. (3) Both retinoids inhibited the clonal proliferation of leukemia cells without necessarily inducing their differentiation; in fact, the only fresh AML cells that were able to undergo differentiation were from patients with APL and one individual with M2 AML. (4) Both retinoids enhanced myeloid and erythroid clonal growth from normal individuals, and 9-cis-RA showed slightly more stimulation of the myeloid clonal growth than did the all-trans-RA. Our study suggests that 9-cis-RA is worthy of further study for the treatment of selected individuals with AML.","['Sakashita, A', 'Kizaki, M', 'Pakkala, S', 'Schiller, G', 'Tsuruoka, N', 'Tomosaki, R', 'Cameron, J F', 'Dawson, M I', 'Koeffler, H P']","['Sakashita A', 'Kizaki M', 'Pakkala S', 'Schiller G', 'Tsuruoka N', 'Tomosaki R', 'Cameron JF', 'Dawson MI', 'Koeffler HP']","['Department of Medicine, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,['5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)'],IM,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/cytology/drug effects', 'Hematopoiesis/*drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/pathology', 'Stereoisomerism', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/02/15 00:00,1993/02/15 00:01,['1993/02/15 00:00'],"['1993/02/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/02/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/02/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)85122-2 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1993 Feb 15;81(4):1009-16.,,,,,,,,"['CA26038/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA33936/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA42710/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,

However, the additive toxicities from ablative preparative regimens may lead to suboptimal use of this combined immunoprophylaxis. We evaluated the efficacy and feasibility of administering MTX/CSP with busulfan (4 mg/kg/d for 4 days) and cyclophosphamide (50 mg/kg/d for 4 days) (BuCy4) in 101 consecutive patients with hematologic malignancies categorized into high- and low-risk groups receiving HLA-matched marrow grafts. Postgrafting immunosuppression consisted of MTX short course (15 mg/m2 on day 1 and 10 mg/m2 on days 3, 6, and 11) and intravenous CSP (1.5 mg/kg every 12 hours). Eighty-three patients (82.1%) received 100% of MTX calculated dose and 87 (86.1%) achieved a CSP therapeutic level (250 to 600 ng/mL) within a median of 16 days. Seventy-three patients (72.2%) received optimal immunosuppressive therapy comprising a full MTX course and achieving CSP therapeutic concentrations. The Kaplan-Meier estimated incidence of grade II to IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was 9.2% for all patients and 5.5% in patients receiving optimal GVHD prophylaxis. Eighty-nine patients (88.2%) survived > or = 100 days posttransplant and 43 (48.3%) developed chronic GVHD, the majority of which were de novo (31 of 43). The estimated incidence of relapse was 28.9% for all patients and 14.8% in the low-risk group, with a median follow-up of 24.5 months. High-risk features and the absence of chronic GVHD were significantly associated with relapse (P = .002 and .036, respectively) in multivariate analyses. Projected disease-free survival at 2 years was 52.3% for all patients and 65.2% in low-risk patients. Disease-free survival was significantly improved in optimally treated patients (P = .03) due to a lower incidence of early deaths from acute GVHD and infectious episodes. In conclusion, optimal delivery of MTX/CSP in association with BuCy4 resulted in a near complete abrogation of acute GVHD in HLA-matched transplants and a significantly improved disease-free survival.","['von Bueltzingsloewen, A', 'Belanger, R', 'Perreault, C', 'Bonny, Y', 'Roy, D C', 'Lalonde, Y', 'Boileau, J', 'Kassis, J', 'Lavallee, R', 'Lacombe, M']","['von Bueltzingsloewen A', 'Belanger R', 'Perreault C', 'Bonny Y', 'Roy DC', 'Lalonde Y', 'Boileau J', 'Kassis J', 'Lavallee R', 'Lacombe M', 'et al.']","['Unite de Transplantation de Moelle Osseuse, Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Busulfan/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Chronic Disease', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Cyclosporine/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Graft vs Host Disease/epidemiology/*prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/surgery/*therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/surgery/*therapy', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/*therapeutic use', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/drug therapy/surgery/*therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/surgery/*therapy', 'Time Factors']",1993/02/01 00:00,1993/02/01 00:01,['1993/02/01 00:00'],"['1993/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)82085-0 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1993 Feb 1;81(3):849-55.,,,,,,,,,,

By using limiting dilution (LD) and clonal specificity analyses, we investigated in 14 patients with and without acute GVHD after non-T-depleted HLA-identical sibling BMT whether posttransplant host-reactive mH-specific interleukin-2 (IL-2)-secreting Th are involved in the development of clinically significant acute GVHD and the establishment of tolerance. At different time intervals posttransplant (I, days 0 through 45; II, days 45 through 90; III, days 90 through 180), host-specific IL-2-secreting Th-precursors (Th-p) were quantitatively assessed in six patients during clinically apparent grade II-III acute GVHD. Frequencies of responding Th-p ranged from 1/13,000 to 1 4,000. The presence of host-specific Th-p was significantly correlated with the development of grade II-III acute GVHD (P = .0003 by Fisher's exact test). The detectability of host-specific Th-p preceded the clinical onset of grade II-III acute GVHD. Host-specific Th-p were no longer detectable after the clinical resolution of grade II-III acute GVHD. No subsequent chronic GVHD was observed in these patients. However, prolonged occurrence of host-specific Th-p was accompanied by clinically persisting acute GVHD and the onset of secondary chronic GVHD. In patients with no acute GVHD (grade 0) (n = 7) and grade I (n = 1) acute GVHD, host-specific Th-p were not detectable at all. We conclude that host-reactive Th are critically involved in the development and maintenance of acute GVHD and may contribute to the establishment of tolerance after genotypically HLA-identical sibling BMT.","['Nierle, T', 'Bunjes, D', 'Arnold, R', 'Heimpel, H', 'Theobald, M']","['Nierle T', 'Bunjes D', 'Arnold R', 'Heimpel H', 'Theobald M']","['Department of Internal Medicine III, University of Ulm, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Interleukin-2)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Anemia, Aplastic/immunology/surgery', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*immunology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/therapeutic use', 'Interleukin-2/*biosynthesis', 'Leukemia/immunology/surgery', 'Lymphocyte Culture Test, Mixed', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/immunology/surgery', 'Nuclear Family', 'Stem Cells/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Helper-Inducer/*immunology', 'Transplantation, Homologous/immunology']",1993/02/01 00:00,1993/02/01 00:01,['1993/02/01 00:00'],"['1993/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)82084-9 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1993 Feb 1;81(3):841-8.,,,,,,,,,,

BPD-MA and DHE photosensitizing activity was tested against two human large-cell lymphoma cell lines and colony-forming unit-leukemia (CFU-L) derived from patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). In mixing experiments, 4-log elimination of tumor cell lines was observed after 1 hour of incubation with 75 ng/mL of BPD-MA or 30 minutes of treatment with 12.5 micrograms/mL of DHE followed by white light exposure. By comparison, using the same concentration of BPD-MA, the mean recovery of normal BM progenitors was 4% +/- 0.8% (mean +/- SD) for granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming unit (CFU-GM) and 5% +/- 0.8% for burst-forming unit-erythroid (BFU-E). Similarly, DHE treatment resulted in the recovery of 5.2% +/- 2% and 9.8% +/- 3% of CFU-GM and BFU-E, respectively. Furthermore, equivalently cytotoxic concentrations of both DHE and BPD-MA and light were found not to kill normal pluripotent stem cells in BM, as demonstrated by their survival in two-step long-term marrow culture at levels equal to untreated controls. The T-lymphoblastic leukemia cell line CEM and its vinblastine (VBL)-resistant subline CEM/VBL, along with the acute promyelocyte leukemia cell line HL-60 and its vincristine (VCR)-resistant subline HL-60/VCR, were also tested. BPD-MA at 75 ng/mL was able to provide a greater than 4-log elimination of the drug-sensitive cell lines, but only a 34% and 55% decrease of the drug-resistant HL-60/VCR and CEM/VBL cell lines, respectively. On the contrary, 12.5 micrograms/mL of DHE reduced the clonogenic growth of all the cell lines by more than 4 logs. Further experiments demonstrated decreased uptake of both BPD-MA and DHE by the resistant cell lines. However, all the cell lines took up more DHE than BPD-MA under similar experimental conditions. Our results demonstrate the preferential cytotoxicity of BPD-MA and DHE toward neoplastic cell lines and CFU-L from AML patients. In addition, DHE was slightly more effective in purging tumor cells expressing the p-170 glycoprotein. These results suggest that photoradiation with DHE would be useful for in vitro purging of residual drug-resistant leukemia and lymphoma cells.","['Lemoli, R M', 'Igarashi, T', 'Knizewski, M', 'Acaba, L', 'Richter, A', 'Jain, A', 'Mitchell, D', 'Levy, J', 'Gulati, S C']","['Lemoli RM', 'Igarashi T', 'Knizewski M', 'Acaba L', 'Richter A', 'Jain A', 'Mitchell D', 'Levy J', 'Gulati SC']","['Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10021.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Porphyrins)', '0 (Radiation-Sensitizing Agents)', '113719-89-4 (benzoporphyrin D)', '97067-70-4 (Dihematoporphyrin Ether)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cell Survival/*drug effects', 'Dihematoporphyrin Ether/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', '*Drug Resistance', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse', 'Photolysis', 'Porphyrins/*pharmacology', 'Radiation-Sensitizing Agents/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/02/01 00:00,1993/02/01 00:01,['1993/02/01 00:00'],"['1993/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)82077-1 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1993 Feb 1;81(3):793-800.,,,,,,,,,,

We have found that blast cells in some cases of B-precursor cell ALL contain Ig heavy chain gene rearrangements with considerable diversity at the junctions of the variable (VH), diversity (D), and joining (JH) regions. This diversity consists of heterogeneous nucleotide sequences at the VH-D and, less frequently, the D-JH junctions. In two cases, different VH segments were attached to the same D-JH rearrangement. In all cases studied there was a much higher than expected frequency of nucleotide sequence changes in the VH segment. At least three mechanisms may produce these changes in different cases: (1) continuing rearrangement of the heavy chain gene, in some cases by VH addition to a preexisting D-JH; (2) VH replacement; and (3) an open-and-shut mechanism. These findings suggest that an active VDJ recombinase system is present at the time of transformation in a high percentage of ALLs.

In this report we examine the effects of IFN-alpha on the distribution of the cytoskeletal protein spectrin in peripheral blood B lymphocytes from normal donors and patients diagnosed with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and hairy cell leukemia (HCL). Exposure of normal and leukemic B cells to IFN-alpha in vitro was shown by immunofluorescence microscopy to cause a dose-dependent increase in the percentage of cells containing discrete focal accumulations of spectrin, ie, a single large aggregate or cap-like structure near the plasma membrane. Although the magnitude of this effect was variable among individual patient samples, in some experiments IFN-alpha induced a fourfold increase in the percentage of leukemic B cells exhibiting focal accumulations of spectrin. Spectrin reorganization induced by IFN-alpha was abrogated by the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide. In addition, IFN-alpha increased the total cellular content of spectrin in B-CLL cells by approximately twofold to fourfold. Finally, a role for protein kinase C in mediating the effects of IFN-alpha on spectrin's organization is implicated by studies in which calphostin C inhibited the IFN-induced focal accumulation of spectrin. Taken together, these studies suggest that the immunomodulatory activities of IFN-alpha in normal and malignant B cells involve a change in the organization of the spectrin-based cytoskeleton.","['Evans, S S', 'Wang, W C', 'Gregorio, C C', 'Han, T', 'Repasky, E A']","['Evans SS', 'Wang WC', 'Gregorio CC', 'Han T', 'Repasky EA']","['Department of Molecular Medicine and Immunology, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, NY 14263.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '12634-43-4 (Spectrin)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/analysis', 'B-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Interferon Type I/*pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*blood/pathology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*blood/pathology', 'Molecular Weight', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Reference Values', 'Spectrin/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Subcellular Fractions/drug effects/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/metabolism']",1993/02/01 00:00,1993/02/01 00:01,['1993/02/01 00:00'],"['1993/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)82073-4 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1993 Feb 1;81(3):759-66.,,,,,,,,"['AI30131/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA42683/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA46645/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,

Multimeric analysis of plasma vWF revealed loss of high molecular weight multimers. The subunit composition and proteolytic pattern of vWF immunopurified from patient plasmas and reduced were studied by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by transblotting and probing with monoclonal antibodies that distinguish cleavages caused by plasmin from those caused by other proteases. There was marked reduction of the relative concentration of the native vWF subunit of 225 Kd in all patient groups, indicating heightened cleavage of the protein. The concentrations of 189- and 140-Kd vWF fragments, normally present in plasma, were increased in cirrhosis and pancreatitis but not in leukemia. Novel fragments, ranging in size from less than 225 to approximately 120 Kd were present in leukemia and cirrhosis, including plasmin-generated fragments of 176 and 145 Kd. These data indicate that in clinical conditions in which there is heightened proteolysis vWF is degraded in vivo by plasmin and other proteases.

In an attempt to improve the survival of children with a late bone marrow (BM) relapse (ie, occurring greater than 6 months after cessation of primary therapy), the Pediatric Oncology Group designed a randomized study to compare the efficacy of doxorubicin/prednisone and cytarabine/teniposide in a multidrug retreatment chemotherapy program. Treatment consisted of remission reinduction with vincristine, prednisone, and doxorubicin, central nervous system prophylaxis with triple intrathecal chemotherapy, and continuation therapy (for 132 weeks) with alternating cycles of oral 6-mercaptopurine/methotrexate and intravenous vincristine/cyclophosphamide. Patients received intermittent courses of either prednisone/doxorubicin (regimen 1) or teniposide/cytarabine (regimen 2) during continuation therapy and a late intensification phase with either vincristine, prednisone, and doxorubicin (regimen 1) or teniposide and cytarabine (regimen 2). One hundred two of 105 evaluable patients (97%) achieved a second complete remission. Twenty-eight of 50 patients on regimen 1 have failed compared with 28 or 52 patients on regimen 2 (log-rank analysis, P = .68), indicating that this trial was inconclusive as to which treatment regimen was superior.

While the randomized trial was inconclusive, prolonged second complete remissions were secured in more than one-third of children with a late BM relapse of ALL.

These approaches include antileukemic therapy at the molecular level by attempts to block the translation of central oncogenes by antisense oligonucleotides or the interference with abnormal signal transduction by modulation of key enzyme systems, eg, tyrosine kinases or protein kinase C. Reversion of the neoplastic phenotype may be obtained by transfection of tumor cells with wild-type tumor-suppressor genes or restoration of cellular differentiation, ie, by retinoic acid in acute promyelocytic leukemia. Antisense oligonucleotides may also be applied to abrogate abnormal expression of hematopoietic growth factors. Growth factors are also being used clinically to sensitize leukemic cells prior to cytostatic treatment or for a more rapid recovery of normal hematopoiesis after intensive chemotherapy. Immunologic approaches against leukemic cells are based on the identification of disease-specific markers, providing the target for antibody therapy with monoclonal antibodies coupled to immunotoxins or allowing the augmentation of cell-mediated immunity by cytokine stimulation, ie, with interleukin-2 or retroviral transfer of genes, eg, the tumor necrosis factor-alpha gene into effector cells.

In the past years one of these factors has become relevant, the risk of living in an area near to high electric voltage lines, generators of electromagnetic fields of low frequency (EMF), which can cause development of leukemia in children. OBJECTIVE: To learn whether living in an area close to EMF generator sources, electric transformers, high electric voltage distribution or transmission lines and electric substations, is a risk factor in the development of leukemia in children living in Mexico City. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A projective study of case-control was accomplished. The cases were obtained from hospitals of the third level. The diagnosis of leukemia in its different varieties was confirmed through biopsy of bone marrow. The controls were selected in the same hospital from inpatients and outpatients with different problems, except neoplasia. A total sample of 81 cases and 77 controls was analyzed. The residence of the controls and cases were visited using a questionnaire coded with the different study variables. To diminish the memory bias in relation to EMF, the subjects were shown different pictures pointing out the different sources of exposures, which were asked. Having obtained the information, different odds ratios (OR) were calculated for the different associations, as well as the confidence intervals at 95% and an unconditioned logistic regression was accomplished to know the adjusted OR. RESULTS: There were no differences between the cases and controls according to the relative who gave the information, the current age of children, the parents's age, the social class and the parent's occupation. It was found that all the generating sources of EMF, which were involved in the study, had and OR above 1. Being the highest, the ones living near the distribution or transmission wires of high voltage with an OR of 2.63 (1.26-5.36) and 2.5 (0.97-6.67) respectively. When the distance of exposure was controlled, the highest OR was for distribution lines (OR 2.12; 0.79-5.85). When the analysis was applied to persons who have moved from the residence, it was found that the OR was above 1 in all the associations, the highest being the distribution wires and with the distance the highest was the electric substations. Furthermore, the multivariate analysis showed that the risk continued only for the distribution wires. CONCLUSIONS: The EMF exposure was found positive, however this is not very precise, that is why it is necessary to carry out other studies to confirm the existence of the association and correct possible biases which could appear during the research.","['Fajardo-Gutierrez, A', 'Garduno-Espinosa, J', 'Yamamoto-Kimura, L', 'Hernandez-Hernandez, D M', 'Gomez-Delgado, A', 'Mejia-Arangure, M', 'Cartagena-Sandoval, A', 'Martinez-Garcia, M C']","['Fajardo-Gutierrez A', 'Garduno-Espinosa J', 'Yamamoto-Kimura L', 'Hernandez-Hernandez DM', 'Gomez-Delgado A', 'Mejia-Arangure M', 'Cartagena-Sandoval A', 'Martinez-Garcia MC']","['Unidad de Epidemiologia Clinica, Hospital de Pediatria, Centro Medico Nacional Siglo XXI, Mexico, D.F.']",['spa'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Mexico,Bol Med Hosp Infant Mex,Boletin medico del Hospital Infantil de Mexico,0414106,,IM,"['Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Electromagnetic Fields/*adverse effects', 'Environmental Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Mexico/epidemiology', 'Odds Ratio', 'Power Plants', 'Prevalence', 'Regression Analysis', 'Residence Characteristics', 'Urban Population/statistics & numerical data']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Bol Med Hosp Infant Mex. 1993 Jan;50(1):32-8.,,,,,,Residencia cercana a fuentes electricas de alta tension y su asociacion con leucemia en ninos.,,,,

Previous studies have failed to identify tissue specific elements in the PIM-1 promoter raising the possibility that these elements might reside within the gene. Transient transfections of Luciferase reporter gene constructs into the chronic myelogenous leukemia cell line K562 (which expresses high levels of PIM-1 mRNA) demonstrate that the 1.7kbp PIM-1 promoter sequences alone were three times more efficient than constructs driven by the promoter+PIM-1 genomic sequences. Nuclear run on assays of nascent RNA from K562 cells revealed premature transcriptional termination within the PIM-1 gene. Thus, PIM-1 gene may be constitutively transcribed in all tissues and transcriptional attenuation could be one of the mechanisms regulating the observed differences in steady state levels of mRNA.","['Nagarajan, L', 'Narayana, L']","['Nagarajan L', 'Narayana L']","['Department of Hematology, University of Texas M.

Information on occupations during or before the relevant pregnancy was sought for 15,279 children dying from cancer in England, Wales, and Scotland in the period 1953-81, and for an equal number of matched controls. Estimates were made for paternal exposure to human-made external ionizing radiation in the six months before conception of the survey child--as judged from job histories and dates of birth. Assessments were also made for potential exposure to unsealed sources of radionuclides. Of the eight fathers placed in the highest dose group (> or = 10 mSv, external radiation), four were cases and four were controls. For the second dose group (5-9 mSv), the corresponding numbers were eight and four, and for the lowest exposed group (1-4 mSv), they were 55 and 42. There were 27 case fathers with potential exposure to radionuclides and only 10 control fathers. The independent effects of the two radiation variables were assessed by means of multiple logistic regression. Relative risks for estimated doses of external radiation were close to unity, but for radionuclide exposure the relative risk was 2.87 (95% CI = 1.15-7.13). These preliminary findings suggest that paternal exposure to radionuclides is a more likely risk factor for childhood cancer than exposure to external radiation.","['Sorahan, T', 'Roberts, P J']","['Sorahan T', 'Roberts PJ']","['Department of Public Health and Epidemiology, University of Birmingham, Edgbaston, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Ind Med,American journal of industrial medicine,8101110,,IM,"['Adult', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'England/epidemiology', '*Fathers', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/epidemiology/etiology', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Nuclear Reactors', 'Occupational Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Radiation, Ionizing', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk']",1993/02/01 00:00,1993/02/01 00:01,['1993/02/01 00:00'],"['1993/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajim.4700230211 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Ind Med. 1993 Feb;23(2):343-54. doi: 10.1002/ajim.4700230211.,,,,,,,,,,

Control for hire during the World War II era and employment duration of less than 1 year had little effect on the radiation risk estimates. Risks associated with length of time spent in 15 job categories were considered as proxies for the effects of other occupational carcinogens. Adjustment for employment duration in each job category one at a time produced only small changes in the radiation risk estimate. Adjustment for potential exposures to beryllium, lead, and mercury also had little effect on the radiation risk estimates. These analyses suggest that selection factors and potential for chemical exposure do not account for the previously noted association of external radiation dose with cancer mortality. However, power to detect effects of chemical exposures is limited by a lack of individual exposure measures.","['Wing, S', 'Shy, C M', 'Wood, J L', 'Wolf, S', 'Cragle, D L', 'Tankersley, W', 'Frome, E L']","['Wing S', 'Shy CM', 'Wood JL', 'Wolf S', 'Cragle DL', 'Tankersley W', 'Frome EL']","['Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill 27599-7400.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Ind Med,American journal of industrial medicine,8101110,,IM,"['Confounding Factors, Epidemiologic', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/mortality', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*mortality', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*mortality', 'Occupational Diseases/*mortality', 'Radiation, Ionizing', 'Risk', 'Tennessee/epidemiology', 'Time Factors']",1993/02/01 00:00,1993/02/01 00:01,['1993/02/01 00:00'],"['1993/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajim.4700230204 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Ind Med. 1993 Feb;23(2):265-79. doi: 10.1002/ajim.4700230204.,,['Am J Ind Med 1993;23(4):673'],,,,,,,,

The elevated expression of a transfected c-myc gene inhibits the commitment and differentiation of MEL cell transformants. In the present work, we have introduced human c-myc mutants into MEL cells under the inducible promoter to define the functional domains of c-Myc involved in erythroid differentiation. The c-Myc domains necessary for commitment and differentiation are not co-localized; almost entire regions are required for inhibition of commitment, whereas domains II and IV that are essential for co-transforming activity with ras are required for inhibition of differentiation. Interestingly, mutants that delete domains for c-Myc dimerization motifs enhanced differentiation.

All reported cases have occurred in patients with a history of neoplasia, including lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, poorly differentiated sarcoma, and benign thymoma. As in pemphigus vulgaris, intraepithelial clefts with acantholysis are noted histopathologically, and intercellular binding of immunoreactants is seen with direct immunofluorescence studies of mucous membrane and skin biopsies. However, immunoreactants may also be found along the basement membrane zone in paraneoplastic pemphigus. Indirect immunofluorescence using rat bladder epithelium as substrate shows an intercellular pattern that appears to be highly specific for paraneoplastic pemphigus. We report a patient with non-Hodgkins lymphoma of 8 years duration who developed severe erosive stomatitis and lichenoid dermatitis after receiving chemotherapy for a relapse of lymphoma. Her case illustrates the typical features of the disorder described as paraneoplastic pemphigus. Neoplasia-associated pemphigus may be a more precise term for this disorder because the course of the blistering eruption does not always parallel the course of the underlying cancer.

In both cases, in addition to the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph), a rearrangement within the major breakpoint cluster region on chromosome 22 was demonstrated, with the breakpoint in the 3' extreme. In patient 1 the disease initially responded to radioactive phosphorus and hydroxyurea, but during the evolutive course a progressive increase in the white blood cell counts was noted, reaching values typical of the chronic phase of CML, and the patient eventually died from blast crisis 45 months after diagnosis. In patient 2, although good control of the platelet counts was achieved with hydroxyurea, the disease also evolved into a blast crisis four months after diagnosis. In both cases monoclonal antibodies and electron microscopy studies demonstrated the megakaryocytic nature of the blast cells.

Analysis of the actions of differentiating agents on leukemic cell lines in vivo has been limited by an inability to unambiguously distinguish host hematopoietic elements from differentiated leukemic cells. In order to identify and quantify leukemic cells during in vivo studies, a derivative of the murine myelomonocytic leukemia cell line WEHI-3B D+, which stably expresses beta-galactosidase, was constructed utilizing retroviral vector gene transfer. This cell line, termed WEHI-3B D+/lacZ 2.8, demonstrated in vitro growth and differentiation properties similar to the parental cell line. WEHI-3B D+/lacZ 2.8 expressed high levels of beta-galactosidase following prolonged in vitro growth and following differentiation in suspension cultures and clonogenic assays. In vivo, WEHI-3B D+/lacZ 2.8 was leukemogenic and high level expression of beta-galactosidase was maintained. Quantification of tissue involvement with WEHI-3B D+/lacZ 2.8 leukemia was performed utilizing staining with the fluorogenic beta-galactosidase substrate fluorescein di-beta-galactoside and fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis. In vivo differentiation efficiency following granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) administration was determined using a simultaneous nuclear and cytoplasmic staining procedure.

We used a molecular genetic/immunohistochemical approach and analysed 21 cases with the primary site in the gastrointestinal tract. Only two bcl-2 gene rearrangements were detected in our series and were found in two out of seven lymphomas with a nodular growth pattern. A chromosomal translocation t(14;18) was demonstrated by comigration of rearranged bcl-2 and JH sequences in one of these two cases. Additionally, both lymphomas showed bcl-2 protein positive neoplastic follicles, CD10 expression, and lack of vimentin. Therefore, these two cases were defined as follicular lymphomas. In contrast to the two follicular lymphomas of MALT, three other, nodular growing, bcl-2 protein positive lymphomas were found to have no bcl-2 gene rearrangements, to be CD10 negative and to express vimentin. These three lymphomas might be composed of neoplastic extrafollicular cells which secondarily invaded reactive follicles. We conclude that the presence of bcl-2 protein positive follicles is consistent with both a follicular and extrafollicular origin of a B lymphoma of MALT. However, the detection of a bcl-2 gene rearrangement is the most valuable criterion in such a situation, and additional immunophenotypic criteria, such as CD10 expression and lack of vimentin within the neoplastic population, further substantiate the diagnosis of a follicular lymphoma in MALT.","['Straka, C', 'Mielke, B', 'Eichelmann, A', 'Trede, I', 'Ho, A D', 'Moller, P']","['Straka C', 'Mielke B', 'Eichelmann A', 'Trede I', 'Ho AD', 'Moller P']","['Medizinische Klinik and Poliklinik V, Heidelberg University, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', '*Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/analysis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'Stomach Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1993/02/01 00:00,1993/02/01 00:01,['1993/02/01 00:00'],"['1993/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1993 Feb;7(2):268-73.,,,['bcl-2'],,,,,,,

In contrast, the gene is normally methylated during the chronic phase of the chronic myeloid leukemia but turns hypermethylated as the disease escalates. As the methylation of the calcitonin gene correlates with the disease activity in chronic myeloid leukemia, it seemed worthwhile to study the gene methylation in other premalignant hematologic conditions with a potential to terminate in fulminant acute leukemia. We report here on the calcitonin gene methylation in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) using a methylation sensitive restriction enzyme HpaII and standard Southern blotting techniques. Bone marrow aspirates from a total of 26 MDS patients were studied. In 24 of these patients, the calcitonin gene was hypermethylated. There was no correlation between the methylation status and the morphological stage of the disease. All six patients with a blast count < 5% had a hypermethylated gene. Of the 19 patients with a blast count > 5%, 17 were hypermethylated only two having normal methylation status of the gene. It appears that the hypermethylation of the calcitonin gene area in the short arm of chromosome 11 may be an early event in the pathogenesis of the myelodysplastic syndromes. The methylation analysis may thus be of value as a diagnostic tool in MDS but an abnormal methylation pattern does not seem to have a direct relation with the degree of blast infiltration.","['Ihalainen, J', 'Pakkala, S', 'Savolainen, E R', 'Jansson, S E', 'Palotie, A']","['Ihalainen J', 'Pakkala S', 'Savolainen ER', 'Jansson SE', 'Palotie A']","['Department of Clinical Chemistry, University of Helsinki, Finland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,['9007-12-9 (Calcitonin)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Anemia, Refractory/genetics', 'Anemia, Refractory, with Excess of Blasts/*genetics', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Calcitonin/*genetics/metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Male', 'Methylation', 'Middle Aged']",1993/02/01 00:00,1993/02/01 00:01,['1993/02/01 00:00'],"['1993/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1993 Feb;7(2):263-7.,,,,,,,,,,

We describe an application of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) which amplifies the VNTR region at the Ha-ras locus and offers a number of advantages over conventional Southern analysis. Ha-ras VNTR genotypes were assigned to 57 normal subjects, 46 patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), 26 with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and 49 with chronic granulocytic leukaemia (CGL). By comparison with previous reports we found significantly higher frequencies of rare alleles (20.2%) in our normal subjects of whom more than 35% had at least one 'rare' allele. The frequencies of rare alleles in the patient groups was not significantly different from the normal group (chi 2 = 0.54, p = 0.91). In studies of constitutional and leukaemic DNA from patients with AML, we found that allelic loss at the Ha-ras locus was not a common phenomenon. The improved resolution achievable with PCR compared with Southern analysis was demonstrated by the inability of Southern analysis to resolve six out of 34 PCR heterozygotes. We therefore suggest that previous studies showing linkage between rare Ha-ras alleles and susceptibility to malignancy should be reevaluated using our sensitive PCR technique.","['Ardern, J C', 'Saunders, M J', 'Hyde, K', 'Lawson, R', 'Yin, J A', 'Lucas, G S']","['Ardern JC', 'Saunders MJ', 'Hyde K', 'Lawson R', 'Yin JA', 'Lucas GS']","['University Department of Clinical and Laboratory Haematology, Manchester Royal Infirmary, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Acute Disease', '*Alleles', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Southern', '*Gene Deletion', 'Gene Frequency/*genetics', '*Genes, ras', 'Genotype', 'Heterozygote', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction']",1993/02/01 00:00,1993/02/01 00:01,['1993/02/01 00:00'],"['1993/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1993 Feb;7(2):258-62.,,,['Ha-ras'],,,,,,,

Rearrangements at the chromosome 11q13 bcl-1 breakpoint loci are present in the majority of these lymphomas, as a result of reciprocal translocation with the 14q32 immunoglobulin heavy chain joining genes. Recently, a gene lying approximately 110 kb telomeric of the bcl-1 major translocation cluster breakpoint locus, designated PRAD1, was proposed as a candidate bcl-1 oncogene. Accumulated evidence now indicates that this gene is the postulated bcl-1 oncogene. It encodes a protein with homology to cyclin family proteins designated cyclin D1 (CCND1). In order to determine whether 11q13 translocation breakpoints were present near the PRAD1 coding region in addition to the previously defined bcl-1 sites, we analyzed 27 centrocytic lymphomas by Southern blot using genomic and cDNA probes flanking the first exon of PRAD1. Five samples showed rearrangement at PRAD1 sites. In four of these, the breakpoints could be mapped from approximately one to 25 kb upstream of the first PRAD1 exon; each showed comigration of rearranged PRAD1 and immunoglobulin heavy-chain joining gene bands consistent with the t(11;14)(q13;q32). The fifth case was rearranged with PRAD1 probes only on BamHI-digested DNA, indicating either a point mutation or a polymorphism at this site. This sample also had rearrangement on multiple enzyme digests with the bcl-1 p94PS probe. None of 80 non-centrocytic B-cell neoplasms showed PRAD1 rearrangement. Thus, rearrangement at both bcl-1 and PRAD1 loci is strongly associated with centrocytic lymphoma, and provides a useful molecular marker for classifying this subtype of lymphoma. Furthermore, translocation-induced aberrant expression of the PRAD1 cyclin may lead to deregulated cell cycle control and play an important role in the pathogenesis of centrocytic lymphoma.","['Williams, M E', 'Swerdlow, S H', 'Rosenberg, C L', 'Arnold, A']","['Williams ME', 'Swerdlow SH', 'Rosenberg CL', 'Arnold A']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville 22908.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)']",IM,"['*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14', 'Cyclin D1', 'Cyclins/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation', '*Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'Point Mutation', 'Translocation, Genetic/*genetics']",1993/02/01 00:00,1993/02/01 00:01,['1993/02/01 00:00'],"['1993/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1993 Feb;7(2):241-5.,,,"['PRAD1', 'bcl-1']",,,,,"['CA 46723/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 55909/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK 11794/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,

With the exception of one patient, very few bone marrow plasma cells expressed the IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) (mean = 2%). This was in contrast to cells from the U-266 plasma cell line, 90% of which had IL-6R. IL-6R expression was lower on bone marrow B cells (mean = 11%) than on peripheral blood B cells (mean = 69%). Studies using either monoclonal or polyclonal anti-human IL-6 to detect endogenous receptor-bound IL-6 found that the IL-6R on bone marrow B cells and plasma cells from patients with multiple myeloma were not saturated with endogenous IL-6 and the presence of receptor-bound IL-6 tended to be associated with stable disease. Thus dysregulated IL-6R expression was not evident on the B cells and plasma cells of patients with multiple myeloma and the increased IL-6R expression on the U-266 plasma cell line was not found on patients' cells.","['Brown, R D', 'Gorenc, B', 'Gibson, J', 'Joshua, D']","['Brown RD', 'Gorenc B', 'Gibson J', 'Joshua D']","['Haematology Department, Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Sydney, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-6)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/*chemistry', 'Bone Marrow/*chemistry', 'Humans', '*Multiple Myeloma/blood/pathology', 'Plasma Cells/*chemistry', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*analysis', 'Receptors, Interleukin-6']",1993/02/01 00:00,1993/02/01 00:01,['1993/02/01 00:00'],"['1993/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1993 Feb;7(2):221-5.,,,,,,,,,,

In normal bone marrow cultures grown in the presence of either granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) or interleukin-3 (IL-3), IL-4 suppresses granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming unit (CFU-GM) proliferation but it enhances the colony-stimulatory effect of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). We studied the effect of IL-4 on chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) bone marrow or peripheral blood cells from 30 patients using the CFU-granulocyte-erythrocyte-monocyte-megakaryocyte colony culture assay. In several repetitive experiments, IL-4 inhibited CFU-GM colony replication by 24 to 65% in a dose-dependent fashion at concentrations ranging from 0.01 to 10 micrograms/ml when patients' cells were cultured in the presence of erythropoietin alone or with phytohemagglutinin-conditioned medium, GM-CSF, or IL-3. The addition of 100 U/ml of IL-1 beta to the CML cultures partially reversed the inhibitory effect of IL-4. Incubation of CML low-density peripheral blood cells with IL-4 resulted in down-regulation of IL-1 beta and IL-6 production in three of four samples, suggesting that the suppressive effect of IL-4 is mediated by inhibition of IL-1 and by other mechanisms including inhibition of IL-6 production. In contrast to the stimulatory effect exerted by IL-4 on G-CSF-dependent CFU-GM progenitor proliferation in normal marrow, the addition of IL-4 to CML cultures grown in the presence of G-CSF resulted in a divergent effect: suppression of CML CFU-GM in two, stimulation in three, and no significant effect in two CML patients' samples. It is therefore possible that IL-4 may have an in vivo antiproliferative effect in a subpopulation of CML patients.","['Estrov, Z', 'Markowitz, A B', 'Kurzrock, R', 'Wetzler, M', 'Kantarjian, H M', 'Ferrajoli, A', 'Gutterman, J U', 'Talpaz, M']","['Estrov Z', 'Markowitz AB', 'Kurzrock R', 'Wetzler M', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Ferrajoli A', 'Gutterman JU', 'Talpaz M']","['Department of Clinical Immunology and Biological Therapy, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Phytohemagglutinins)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', '*Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Culture Media, Conditioned', 'Erythropoietin/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/biosynthesis/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1/biosynthesis/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-4/antagonists & inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phytohemagglutinins/pharmacology']",1993/02/01 00:00,1993/02/01 00:01,['1993/02/01 00:00'],"['1993/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1993 Feb;7(2):214-20.,,,,,,,,,,

Nine cases were diagnosed as typical HCL, and two cases had the features of HCL variant (prolymphocytic variant). The remaining 29 cases (72.5%) differed morphologically and hematologically from the other two groups in that they usually had a moderately high leukocyte count (average 27.9 x 10(3)/microliters), and abnormal cells showing a densely stained round nucleus and an inconspicuous nucleolus. Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase reaction was weak, and their cells exhibited generally smooth or slightly irregular, cellular outlines in smears. The cells showed weak expression of surface immunoglobulin G (IgG) with kappa-chain predominance. CD25 antigen was not detected. Some of these findings resemble those of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia, but the patients also had several important features of HCL. They had splenomegaly without significant lymphadenopathy. The abnormal cells were CD20+, CD11c+ and showed typical 'hairy morphology' under phase-contrast and scanning electron microscopy. Furthermore, spleen sections revealed diffuse infiltration by the abnormal cells in the red pulp.

Pro T-ALL was more often observed in adults, and showed a lower incidence of hyperleukocytosis than more mature T-ALL. Mediastinal masses and polar acid phosphatase positivity in blast cells were however observed with the same frequency in pro T-ALL and late T-ALL, and rearrangements of both T-cell receptor (TCR) beta and gamma genes were observed in half the pro T-ALL cases tested. The expression of CD34, DR, and myeloid (My) markers was significantly more frequent in pro T-ALL than in late T-ALL, and these three features were strongly linked. TCR gene rearrangements were two to three times more frequent in CD34- and My-pro T-ALL. However, both CD34+ and My+ pro T-ALL showed an incidence of mediastinal masses and polar acid phosphatase positivity similar to this observed in CD34- and My- cases. This supports the assumption that both types of ALL indeed are engaged in the T-lineage, and confirms intracytoplasmic cCD3 as the earliest marker for this lineage. Moreover, CD34 appears to persist up to an early stage of T-cell maturation, where the cells retain myeloid potentiality. Loss of CD34 correlates with TCR-beta gene rearrangement and definitive commitment to the T lineage. Event-free survival analysis suggested a poorer outcome for pro T-ALL in adult patients.","['Garand, R', 'Voisin, S', 'Papin, S', 'Praloran, V', 'Lenormand, B', 'Favre, M', 'Philip, P', 'Bernier, M', 'Vanhaecke, D', 'Falkenrodt, A']","['Garand R', 'Voisin S', 'Papin S', 'Praloran V', 'Lenormand B', 'Favre M', 'Philip P', 'Bernier M', 'Vanhaecke D', 'Falkenrodt A', 'et al.']","[""Laboratoire d'Hematologie, Hotel Dieu, Nantes, France.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD/*analysis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*immunology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Remission Induction']",1993/02/01 00:00,1993/02/01 00:01,['1993/02/01 00:00'],"['1993/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1993 Feb;7(2):161-7.,,,,,,,,,,

The impact of these observations on the controversy surrounding Ph ALL and Ph+ chronic granulocytic leukemia (CGL) is unclear. Twenty cases of Ph ALL (four newly investigated and 16 previously published) were classified into nine stem-cell (the Ph in myeloid and lymphoid cells) and 11 lymphoid-restricted cases. Lymphoid cases had a lower leucocyte count (56 x 10(9)/l) than stem-cell cases (151 x 10(9)/l) (p < 0.01). The M-bcr and m-bcr breakpoints (in 14 cases) were found in lymphoid (four cases of each) and stem-cell (five and one cases respectively) cases. Lymphoid cases had significantly shorter event-free survival (median 4 months) than stem-cell cases (median 35 months) (p < 0.01). M-bcr cases were older (mean 41 years) than m-bcr cases (mean 36 years)(p = NS); m-bcr cases had higher leukocyte counts (mean 85 x 10(9)/l) than M-bcr cases (36 x 10(9)/l)(p < 0.01) but breakpoint had no impact on prognosis.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: After initial CR was induced by the combination of daunorubicin, cytarabine, and thioguanine, patients not eligible for allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (alloBMT) were offered autoBMT. Within a median of 2 months after CR, and without intervening postremission therapy, bone marrow was obtained, purged by exposure to 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide (4-HC), and cryopreserved. High-dose therapy consisted of oral busulfan over 4 days (16 mg/kg total) followed by intravenous (IV) cyclophosphamide 50 mg/kg daily for 4 days. The cryopreserved marrow was then reinfused. RESULTS: Of the 39 patients scheduled for autoBMT, four relapsed before transplantation. Two of the 35 (6%) transplant patients died of transplant-related complications, and 11 (33%) relapsed a median of 8 months after marrow reinfusion. No relapse has occurred after 24 months posttransplant. With a median follow-up of 31 months, the median disease-free survival period for all 39 patients has not been reached; however, 54% +/- 16% of patients are projected to be alive and disease-free at 3 years. CONCLUSION: Long-term, disease-free survival after autoBMT in AML seems to be better than the outcome after conventional-dose postremission therapy and rivals the results of alloBMT.","['Cassileth, P A', 'Andersen, J', 'Lazarus, H M', 'Colvin, O M', 'Bennett, J M', 'Stadtmauer, E A', 'Kaizer, H', 'Weiner, R S', 'Edelstein, M', 'Oken, M M']","['Cassileth PA', 'Andersen J', 'Lazarus HM', 'Colvin OM', 'Bennett JM', 'Stadtmauer EA', 'Kaizer H', 'Weiner RS', 'Edelstein M', 'Oken MM']","['Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Purging', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation/methods', 'Cryopreservation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*surgery', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/drug therapy/*surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pilot Projects', 'Prospective Studies', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",1993/02/01 00:00,1993/02/01 00:01,['1993/02/01 00:00'],"['1993/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1993.11.2.314 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1993 Feb;11(2):314-9. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1993.11.2.314.,,,,,,,,"['CA 15488/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 21115/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 23318/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients received a second transplant for recurrent chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) (n = 28), acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) (n = 32), and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (n = 15) or lymphoma (n = 2) that used the same marrow donor as the initial transplant. High-dose chemotherapy of busulfan (BU) and cyclophosphamide (CY), or CY, carmustine (BCNU), and etoposide (VP-16), was used as a preparative regimen for the second transplant. Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis consisted of the following: no prophylaxis (n = 8), T-cell depletion (n = 36), methotrexate (MTX) only (n = 21), cyclosporine (CSP) only (n = 1), MTX and CSP (n = 9), or anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) and prednisone (n = 2). RESULTS: Engraftment occurred in the 74 assessable patients. Severe veno-occlusive disease (VOD) was the most frequent cause of grades 3 and 4 regimen-related toxicity (RRT); it occurred in 20 patients. The probability of death before day 100 from nonleukemic causes was 36%. The probability of relapse after second transplant was 70%, and the DFS rate was 14% (median DFS, 36 months; range, 22 to 87). The DFS rates for ALL, AML, and CML were 8%, 10%, and 25%, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that the risk of relapse was inversely associated with acute GVHD (relative risk [RR] of relapse = 0.2; P = .0009). No other factor was associated with relapse. DFS was associated with the presence of acute GVHD (RR of treatment failure = 0.5; P = .0085), and a reduction of DFS was associated with severe VOD (RR = 10.6; P = .0001) and those patients older than 10 years (RR = 2.5; P = .0337). CONCLUSION: These data show that some patients may benefit from a second marrow transplant for recurrent leukemia after an initial marrow transplant. Younger patients and patients with CML especially should be considered as potential candidates for a second transplant.","['Radich, J P', 'Sanders, J E', 'Buckner, C D', 'Martin, P J', 'Petersen, F B', 'Bensinger, W', 'McDonald, G B', 'Mori, M', 'Schoch, G', 'Hansen, J A']","['Radich JP', 'Sanders JE', 'Buckner CD', 'Martin PJ', 'Petersen FB', 'Bensinger W', 'McDonald GB', 'Mori M', 'Schoch G', 'Hansen JA']","['Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA 98104.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/epidemiology/prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*radiotherapy/*surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Recurrence', 'Reoperation', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', '*Whole-Body Irradiation']",1993/02/01 00:00,1993/02/01 00:01,['1993/02/01 00:00'],"['1993/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1993.11.2.304 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1993 Feb;11(2):304-13. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1993.11.2.304.,,,,,,,,"['CA-18029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P0-1 AI-29518/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,

A therapeutic dose-escalation study of M195 labeled with iodine 131 was conducted in patients with relapsed or refractory myeloid leukemias. METHODS: Twenty-four patients (16 relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemias, five blastic myelodysplastic syndromes [MDS], two chemotherapy-related secondary leukemias, and one blastic chronic myelogenous leukemia [CML]), including seven who had failed to respond to prior bone marrow transplantation (BMT), received from 50 mCi/m2 to 210 mCi/m2 of 131I-M195 in divided doses. RESULTS: In 22 patients, whole-body gamma-imaging demonstrated marked uptake of antibody into all areas of bone marrow. Twenty-three patients (96%) demonstrated decreases in peripheral-blood cell counts, with decreased percentage of bone marrow blasts seen in 83% of cases. Eighty-nine percent of bone marrow biopsies examined quantitatively demonstrated substantial decreases in the number of blasts, with greater than 99% of blasts killed in some patients. The two cases that failed to demonstrate leukemic cytoreduction occurred in the first two dose levels. For 131I doses of 135 mCi/m2 or greater, pancytopenia was profound and lasted for at least 12 days. Eight patients had sufficient marrow cytoreduction to proceed to BMT. Three of these achieved marrow remission, one of 6+, and one of 9 months' duration. Two patients in blastic phase temporarily reverted to their original myelodysplastic states. Thirty-seven percent of assessable patients developed human anti-mouse antibody (HAMA). In two patients with HAMA who were re-treated, plasma 131I-M195 levels could not be maintained and no therapeutic effect resulted. Significant nonhematologic toxicity (hepatic) was seen in one patient and the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) was not reached. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that safe leukemic cytoreduction can be achieved with 131I-M195 even in multiply relapsed or chemotherapy-refractory leukemias. This agent may be useful as part of a preparative regimen for BMT.","['Schwartz, M A', 'Lovett, D R', 'Redner, A', 'Finn, R D', 'Graham, M C', 'Divgi, C R', 'Dantis, L', 'Gee, T S', 'Andreeff, M', 'Old, L J']","['Schwartz MA', 'Lovett DR', 'Redner A', 'Finn RD', 'Graham MC', 'Divgi CR', 'Dantis L', 'Gee TS', 'Andreeff M', 'Old LJ', 'et al.']","['Leukemia Service, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10021.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Iodine Radioisotopes)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*administration & dosage', 'Bone Marrow/radiation effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Iodine Radioisotopes/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*radiotherapy', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Middle Aged', '*Radioimmunotherapy/adverse effects', 'Recurrence', 'Treatment Outcome']",1993/02/01 00:00,1993/02/01 00:01,['1993/02/01 00:00'],"['1993/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1993.11.2.294 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1993 Feb;11(2):294-303. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1993.11.2.294.,,,,,,,,"['CA09207/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01CA33049/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty patients with relapsed acute lymphocytic leukemia were given teniposide as part of their induction and maintenance therapy. Before beginning reinduction therapy, an intensive pharmacokinetic study was performed based on 12 measured teniposide plasma concentrations. Doses were determined to achieve a targeted systemic exposure defined by an area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) beginning at an AUC consistent with that predicted for a patient with average pharmacokinetic parameters receiving the currently accepted maximal-tolerated dose. The targeted systemic exposure was then escalated in increments of 25% in cohorts of at least three patients until unacceptable toxicity occurred. In 36 follow-up studies, when teniposide was administered during maintenance therapy, a Bayesian strategy based on only three or five measured drug concentrations was evaluated for precision and bias for achieving the targeted systemic exposure against the full pharmacokinetic study. RESULTS: Teniposide clearance varied over a fivefold range (3.7 to 21.6 mL/min/m2). With the use of the patient-specific dosage regimens, the intensity of systemic exposure was increased 50% (1,656 mumol.h v 1,060 mumol/L.h) over that previously possible with standard fixed doses, with no increase in acute, nonhematologic toxicity. Teniposide concentrations (n = 265) were well predicted (R2 = .82) with as few as three measured values from the initial study. CONCLUSION: Targeting systemic exposure is clinically feasible, precise, and allows increased dose intensity for teniposide without increased risk of acute, nonhematologic toxicity, when compared with fixed-dose regimens.","['Rodman, J H', 'Furman, W L', 'Sunderland, M', 'Rivera, G', 'Evans, W E']","['Rodman JH', 'Furman WL', 'Sunderland M', 'Rivera G', 'Evans WE']","[""Pharmaceutical Department, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,['957E6438QA (Teniposide)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bayes Theorem', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Regression Analysis', 'Teniposide/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics', 'Treatment Outcome']",1993/02/01 00:00,1993/02/01 00:01,['1993/02/01 00:00'],"['1993/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1993.11.2.287 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1993 Feb;11(2):287-93. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1993.11.2.287.,,,,,,,,"['CA20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,

Unexpected results of the Childhood Acute Myelogenous Leukemia Study BFM-87.,279-86,"PURPOSE: One of the goals of study AMA-BFM-87 was to test prospectively in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) patients if cranial irradiation could be replaced by late intensification therapy with high-dose cytarabine (Ara-C) and etoposide (VP-16). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with a low risk of CNS relapses (ie, no initial CNS disease, WBC count at diagnosis < or = 70.000/microL) were randomized for irradiation (group A, 31 patients). In 25 patients (group B), randomization was refused. As interim results showed no increase of CNS relapses in nonirradiated patients, prophylactic irradiation was discontinued after 2 1/2 years to prevent unnecessary CNS toxicity. Forty-four patients (group C) entered the study after randomization had been stopped. RESULTS: In all patients with a low risk of CNS recurrences (n = 100), a significantly higher probability of relapse-free interval (pRFI) of 5 years was found in irradiated patients (pRFI = .78) compared with nonirradiated patients (pRFI = .41) (P = .007). Moreover, a slightly higher incidence of CNS relapses was observed in nonirradiated patients. Due to the small number of patients, this was not observed when randomized patients only were analyzed. In accordance with these findings, the favorable outcome of low-risk patients in the preceding study, AML-BFM-83 (pRFI > .80), could only be reproduced in study AML-BFM-87 in patients who had received cranial irradiation. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that cranial irradiation should be an integral part of the treatment of all AML patients not undergoing bone marrow transplantation. Residual blasts in the CNS may escape systemic chemotherapy and lead to recurrence of the initial disease not only in the CNS, but also in the bone marrow.","['Creutzig, U', 'Ritter, J', 'Zimmermann, M', 'Schellong, G']","['Creutzig U', 'Ritter J', 'Zimmermann M', 'Schellong G']","[""University Children's Hospital, Munster, Germany.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Bone Marrow/*radiation effects', 'Brain Neoplasms/prevention & control', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Cranial Irradiation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*prevention & control/*radiotherapy', 'Life Tables', 'Male', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Recurrence', 'Regression Analysis', 'Risk']",1993/02/01 00:00,1993/02/01 00:01,['1993/02/01 00:00'],"['1993/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1993.11.2.279 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1993 Feb;11(2):279-86. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1993.11.2.279.,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred twenty children were treated on Pediatric Oncology Group (POG) protocol 8304. All children had received prophylactic CNS therapy during their initial treatment. The treatment protocol included a four-drug reinduction and six weekly doses of triple intrathecal therapy (TIT). Cranial radiation, 24 Gy, was followed by monthly TIT. Systemic consolidation and maintenance therapy included 6-week cycles of mercaptopurine/methotrexate (6MP/MTX) and vincristine/cyclophosphamide (VCR/CTX), with randomization to intervening pulses of prednisone/doxorubicin (PDN/DOX) or teniposide (VM26)/cytarabine (Ara-C) for a total of 88 weeks. RESULTS: All 120 patients achieved a second complete remission. There have been 61 protocol failures. Thirty-five patients had a bone marrow relapse, four with simultaneous CNS involvement and one with concurrent testicular leukemia. Thirteen patients had a second isolated CNS relapse, 10 a testicular relapse, and two relapsed in other sites. One patient died in remission. Overall event-free survival (EFS) at 4 years was 46% +/- 7%. The toxicity associated with this protocol was minimal except for leukoencephalopathy, which occurred in 20 (17%) patients. The treatment comparison between VM26/Ara-C or PDN/DOX pulses showed a trend toward superior EFS (P = .12) in favor of VM-26/Ara-C. CONCLUSION: To date, this represents the largest series of patients with ALL treated uniformly for an isolated CNS relapse.

Intergroup Rhabdomyosarcoma Study Committee.,262-70,"PURPOSE: This study was performed to determine the incidence and risk factors involved in the development of a second malignant neoplasm (SMN) after treatment of primary rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) in patients enrolled onto Intergroup Rhabdomyosarcoma Studies I and II (IRS I and II). PATIENTS AND METHODS: There were 1,770 patients with primary RMS entered onto IRS I and II between 1972 and 1984. They were treated with chemotherapy and, in most instances, radiotherapy according to randomized or assigned regimens based on clinical grouping. Median follow-up time for these patients was 8.4 years. Incidence density (ID) was calculated for each study and for treatment and age groups. The 10-year cumulative incidence was estimated for each study. RESULTS: Twenty-two SMNs have been reported through 1991. The most common tumor type was a bone sarcoma followed by acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia (ANLL). The median time to the development of an SMN was 7 years (range, 1 11/12 to 15 9/12 years). The 10-year cumulative incidence rate was 1.7% for both studies. ID and cumulative incidence estimates were highest for patients who received both an alkylating agent and radiotherapy. The majority of patients for whom family histories were available had either neurofibromatosis themselves or a family history that suggested the Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS). CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest that genetic abnormalities play a prominent role in the development of an SMN after therapy for a primary RMS. Chemotherapy with an alkylating agent and radiotherapy play significant roles in the development of an SMN compared with patients who received only one of these therapeutic modalities.","['Heyn, R', 'Haeberlen, V', 'Newton, W A', 'Ragab, A H', 'Raney, R B', 'Tefft, M', 'Wharam, M', 'Ensign, L G', 'Maurer, H M']","['Heyn R', 'Haeberlen V', 'Newton WA', 'Ragab AH', 'Raney RB', 'Tefft M', 'Wharam M', 'Ensign LG', 'Maurer HM']","['Pediatric Intergroup Statistical Center, Houston, TX.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/etiology', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*etiology/genetics', 'Radiotherapy/adverse effects', 'Rhabdomyosarcoma/*therapy']",1993/02/01 00:00,1993/02/01 00:01,['1993/02/01 00:00'],"['1993/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1993.11.2.262 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1993 Feb;11(2):262-70. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1993.11.2.262.,,,,['J Clin Oncol. 1993 May;11(5):1005.

We considered it important to evaluate these patients for development of second cancers (SCs). PATIENTS AND METHODS: The Norwegian Cancer Registry identified previously untreated patients with HD treated at NRH who had developed a SC more than 1 year after diagnosis of HD. The relative risk ratio (RR) (observed/expected cases) and the cumulative risk were calculated. RESULTS: Sixty-eight patients had developed a SC, including nine acute nonlymphocytic leukemias (ANLLs), eight non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHLs), and 51 solid tumors, including 11 lung cancers. The RR of SC and leukemia was 1.86 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.4 to 2.4) and 24.3 (95% CI, 11.1 to 46.2), respectively. The RR of SC was highest in younger patients (< 41 years, RR = 3.8). No significant association between splenectomy and development of ANLL was found. The influence of treatment and follow-up time on the development of SC agrees with data from other large cancer institutions. CONCLUSION: (1) The low RR of developing a SC in this study is probably due to the number of older patients included, who have a lower RR of developing a SC due to less aggressive treatment, shorter follow-up time, and higher incidence of cancer in the expected background population. (2) The low RR and cumulative risk of developing ANLL may be due to the limited use of extensive chemotherapy (CT) in our hospital in the earlier years.","['Abrahamsen, J F', 'Andersen, A', 'Hannisdal, E', 'Nome, O', 'Abrahamsen, A F', 'Kvaloy, S', 'Host, H']","['Abrahamsen JF', 'Andersen A', 'Hannisdal E', 'Nome O', 'Abrahamsen AF', 'Kvaloy S', 'Host H']","['Norwegian Radium Hospital, Oslo.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Hodgkin Disease/drug therapy/radiotherapy/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/etiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*etiology', 'Norway', 'Registries', 'Risk Factors', 'Time Factors']",1993/02/01 00:00,1993/02/01 00:01,['1993/02/01 00:00'],"['1993/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1993.11.2.255 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1993 Feb;11(2):255-61. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1993.11.2.255.,,,,['J Clin Oncol. 1993 May;11(5):1005.

This regimen includes three additional agents not found in CHOP, uses weekly doses of alternating myelosuppressive and nonmyelosuppressive drugs, and incorporates most single agents active against diffuse lymphomas. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Ninety-one previously untreated patients were enrolled and 60 patients were confirmed eligible after central pathology review. Fifty-eight percent of patients had diffuse large-cell lymphoma (DLCL), 83% had stage III or IV disease, and 45% had B symptoms. RESULTS: Patients were treated with six to eight cycles of AMOPLACE and analyzed for response and survival. With a median follow-up of 48 months, complete responses (CRs) were seen in 68% of all patients with failure-free survival (FFS) and overall survival (OS) estimates at 4 years of 45% and 54%. In the DLCL subset, the CR rate was 69% and FFS and OS estimates at 4 years were 49% and 60%, respectively. The major toxicity was myelosuppression, with 73% of patients having WBC nadirs less than 1,000/microL; two treatment-related deaths occurred. CONCLUSION: We conclude that AMOPLACE is associated with CR and OS rates comparable with those of other third-generation regimens.","['Parker, B A', 'Santarelli, M', 'Green, M R', 'Anderson, J R', 'Cooper, M R', 'Case, D Jr', 'Barcos, M', 'Peterson, B A', 'Gottlieb, A J']","['Parker BA', 'Santarelli M', 'Green MR', 'Anderson JR', 'Cooper MR', 'Case D Jr', 'Barcos M', 'Peterson BA', 'Gottlieb AJ']","['University of California, San Diego Cancer Center 92103-8421.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",1993/02/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1993/02/01 00:00'],"['1993/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1993/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1993.11.2.248 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1993 Feb;11(2):248-54. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1993.11.2.248.,,,,,,,,"['CA 11789/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 33601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'M01RR00827/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two hundred five consecutive children with early B-lineage ALL were treated according to the Dallas/Fort Worth (DFW) protocol between January 1986 and July 1, 1991. Therapy included a four-drug induction followed by consolidation and continuation phases of nightly oral mercaptopurine (6-MP) and repetitive courses of divided-dose oral methotrexate (dMTX) and asparaginase (L-asp). Three doses of VP-16 and cytarabine (Ara-C) were given during consolidation and later, during continuation, two doses were given 3 to 4 days apart, every 9 weeks. Intrathecal (IT) chemotherapy was given throughout the treatment period. RESULTS: Two hundred three of the 205 patients entered remission. Only eight of these 203 children have had a bone marrow relapse (ALL). However, 10 other children have developed secondary AML 23 to 68 months following the diagnosis of ALL. Overall event-free survival (EFS) at 4 years is 79.3% +/- 5.1%, with a risk of secondary AML at 4 years of 5.9% +/- 3.2%. CONCLUSION: This experience provides strong evidence for a link between epipodophyllotoxin therapy and secondary AML since none of these children received alkylating agent therapy or irradiation. This serious complication raises concern as to the appropriate use of epipodophyllotoxins in the treatment of childhood ALL.","['Winick, N J', 'McKenna, R W', 'Shuster, J J', 'Schneider, N R', 'Borowitz, M J', 'Bowman, W P', 'Jacaruso, D', 'Kamen, B A', 'Buchanan, G R']","['Winick NJ', 'McKenna RW', 'Shuster JJ', 'Schneider NR', 'Borowitz MJ', 'Bowman WP', 'Jacaruso D', 'Kamen BA', 'Buchanan GR']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas 75235-9063.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,['6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Etoposide/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*chemically induced/pathology', 'Male', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*chemically induced', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Recurrence', 'Risk', 'Treatment Outcome']",1993/02/01 00:00,1993/02/01 00:01,['1993/02/01 00:00'],"['1993/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1993.11.2.209 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1993 Feb;11(2):209-17. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1993.11.2.209.,,,,"['J Clin Oncol. 1993 May;11(5):1005.

We have isolated stable FCE-24517-resistant cell sublines from murine leukemia L1210 cells by in vitro exposure to the drug. FCE 24517 selects a mixed population of resistant cells: the L1210/24517(1) cell line in vitro was in fact resistant to the selecting agent (RI 48.3), as well as to L-PAM (RI 5.4) and DX (RI 8.6) and over-expressed the mdr-I gene. When L1210/24517(1) cells were implanted in vivo and evaluated for sensitivity to the same agents, resistance was observed only to FCE 24517 and partially to L-PAM, whereas DX had the same anti-tumor efficacy as on the sensitive line. The clone derived from the above subline (L1210/24517(2)) was resistant to FCE 24517, distamycin-A and other cytotoxic compounds bearing the distamycin-A skeleton, and fully sensitive to DX and other anti-tumor compounds involved in the multi-drug resistance mechanisms, with a complete disappearance of the mdr phenotype. L1210/24517(2) cell line is partially cross-resistant to L-PAM, this resistance being accounted for by higher GSH intracellular levels, which however do not influence the resistance to FCE 24517. In fact, BSO treatment was capable of significantly modifying only the cytotoxicity of L-PAM. Our data suggest that L1210/24517(2) cells present a mechanism of resistance specific for FCE 24517 and related molecules.","['Geroni, C', 'Pesenti, E', 'Tagliabue, G', 'Ballinari, D', 'Mongelli, N', 'Broggini, M', 'Erba, E', ""D'Incalci, M"", 'Spreafico, F', 'Grandi, M']","['Geroni C', 'Pesenti E', 'Tagliabue G', 'Ballinari D', 'Mongelli N', 'Broggini M', 'Erba E', ""D'Incalci M"", 'Spreafico F', 'Grandi M']","['Farmitalia Carlo Erba, Experimental Oncology Department, Nerviano, MI, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Distamycins)', '0 (Nitrogen Mustard Compounds)', '1982-67-8 (Methionine Sulfoximine)', '5072-26-4 (Buthionine Sulfoximine)', '71193OXG6S (tallimustine)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Buthionine Sulfoximine', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Separation', 'Distamycins/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance/genetics/physiology', 'Female', 'Glutathione/physiology', 'Leukemia L1210/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Methionine Sulfoximine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Nitrogen Mustard Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1993/01/21 00:00,1993/01/21 00:01,['1993/01/21 00:00'],"['1993/01/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/21 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/21 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.2910530223 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1993 Jan 21;53(2):308-14. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910530223.,,,,,,,,,,

The maximum expression was detected in the terminal stage of differentiation. The profile of tyrosine phosphorylation in cellular proteins was distinct among cells at various stages of the differentiation program. The 116 kd tyrosine-phosphorylated protein detected in exponentially proliferating HL60 cells diminished during the course of the growth arrest and a distinct profile of tyrosine phosphorylation (including 177 and 165 kd proteins) appeared in cells undergoing terminal granulocytic differentiation. These findings implicate the involvement of p55c-fgr in the process of terminal granulocytic differentiation.

This evidence of shared recombinase activity for myeloid, T cell, and B cell-lineage tumors and the absence of such activity in erythroid tumors suggest early divergence of the erythroid pathway.","['Fredrickson, T N', 'Hartley, J W', 'Morse, H C 3rd']","['Fredrickson TN', 'Hartley JW', 'Morse HC 3rd']","['Laboratory of Immunopathology, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Erythroblasts/*pathology', 'Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte/*genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains/genetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*blood/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*blood/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*blood/*genetics', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/blood/genetics', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/blood/genetics', 'Mice', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/genetics', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta/genetics']",1993/02/01 00:00,1993/02/01 00:01,['1993/02/01 00:00'],"['1993/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1993 Feb;21(2):354-7.,,,"['IgH', 'IgK', 'TcR-&bgr;', 'TcR-&ggr;']",,,,,['N01-AI-72622/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,

The protooncogene c-fms, coding for the macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) receptor, is characteristically expressed in cells of monocytic lineage, but is not present in HL-60 cells. Since M-CSF has an undefined role in osteoclast development, we wished to examine the effect of 1,25-(OH)2D3, a strong promoter of osteoclast development, on the induction of M-CSF receptor. Treatment of HL-60 cells with 10-50 ng/ml PMA for 3 days stimulated expression of c-fms, as measured by steady state mRNA levels. Treatment with 10 nM 1,25-(OH)2D3 for 4-72 h did not promote c-fms expression. In fact, 1,25-(OH)2D3 attenuated PMA-stimulated c-fms expression in a dose-dependent manner (ED50, 1 nM). Along with attenuation of c-fms expression, 1,25-(OH)2D3 induced expression of mRNA for the osteoclastic enzyme carbonic anhydrase-II (CA II) almost 2-fold over the level expressed in untreated HL-60 cells. The addition of PMA to the culture diminished the basal expression of CA II mRNA, but did not affect 1,25-(OH)2D3-stimulated CA II induction. PMA and 1,25-(OH)2D3, thus, promote divergent phenotype development in the HL-60 cell. Induction of c-fms mRNA by PMA should ensure further macrophage development. The effect of 1,25-(OH)2D3 to attenuate expression of c-fms mRNA and stimulate CA II mRNA suggests that 1,25-(OH)2D3 activates osteoclast, rather than macrophage, development. 1,25-(OH)2D3-induced phenotypic changes may, therefore, involve modulation of the M-CSF effect.","['Biskobing, D M', 'Rubin, J']","['Biskobing DM', 'Rubin J']","['Department of Medicine, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia 30322.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Endocrinology,Endocrinology,0375040,"['0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Oligonucleotide Probes)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 4.2.1.1 (Carbonic Anhydrases)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Calcitriol/*pharmacology', 'Carbonic Anhydrases/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'DNA Probes', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Genes, fms/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Monocytes/cytology/drug effects', 'Oligonucleotide Probes', 'Osteoclasts/cytology/drug effects', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Receptor, Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/drug effects/*genetics', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/02/01 00:00,1993/02/01 00:01,['1993/02/01 00:00'],"['1993/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1210/endo.132.2.8425498 [doi]'],ppublish,Endocrinology. 1993 Feb;132(2):862-6. doi: 10.1210/endo.132.2.8425498.,,,['c-fms'],,,,,,,

The action of IL-2 is known to be mediated through binding to a specific IL-2 receptor (IL-2R) which comprises at least two distinct proteins: IL-2R alpha (p55) and IL-2R beta (p70-75). However, the expression and function of IL-2R are largely unknown in acute myeloblastic leukemia cells. In a human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), IL-3, or stem cell factor-dependent myeloid leukemia cell line (M07E), IL-2 was found to stimulate proliferation in a dose-dependent manner and to augment GM-CSF- and stem cell factor-induced proliferation of M07E cells. The expression of IL-2R beta on M07E cells was detectable with 125I-IL-2 binding and affinity cross-linking analyses and with a monoclonal antibody against IL-2R beta, Mik-beta 1. Although the expression of IL-2R beta was not down-regulated but somewhat up-regulated by treatment with GM-CSF in both mRNA and protein levels, GM-CSF was found to compete (75%) with radiolabeled IL-2 for binding to IL-2R on M07E cells, whereas no competition of GM-CSF binding was observed with IL-2 even at a 400-fold molar excess. These results suggest that IL-2R may be functionally expressed in some cases of acute myeloblastic leukemia cells and raise the possibility that IL-2 may have some effects on human myelopoiesis.","['Kanakura, Y', 'Sugahara, H', 'Mitsui, H', 'Ikeda, H', 'Furitsu, T', 'Yagura, H', 'Kitayama, H', 'Kanayama, Y', 'Matsuzawa, Y']","['Kanakura Y', 'Sugahara H', 'Mitsui H', 'Ikeda H', 'Furitsu T', 'Yagura H', 'Kitayama H', 'Kanayama Y', 'Matsuzawa Y']","['Second Department of Internal Medicine, Osaka University Medical School, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Cross-Linking Reagents)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Iodine Radioisotopes)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Binding, Competitive', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cross-Linking Reagents/pharmacology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Iodine Radioisotopes', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Transcription, Genetic/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/02/01 00:00,1993/02/01 00:01,['1993/02/01 00:00'],"['1993/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1993 Feb 1;53(3):675-80.,,,"['IL-2&bgr;', 'IL-2r&agr;']",,,,,,,

Electron microscopy studies of mitoxantrone-treated myocytes showed disorganized myofibrillar structures, swollen mitochondria, and extensive vacuolization. Cardiotoxicity, reflected as the ratio of intracellular ATP/protein and the loss of spontaneous beating, was only partially reduced by continuous ICRF-187 concentrations up to 50 micrograms/ml. ICRF-187 induced myocyte protection which was dependent on the dose and duration of exposure. ICRF-187 also reduced the cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin to a lesser extent and reduced the toxicity of a postulated cyclic mitoxantrone metabolite. However, the cardiotoxicity of ametantrone, a nonmetal-binding analogue of mitoxantrone, was unaltered with ICRF-187. The antitumor activity of mitoxantrone was unaltered by ICRF-187 in human tumor cells and in P-388-bearing mice. In addition, ICRF-187 allowed for 50% greater cumulative dosing in normal mice that, nonetheless, showed extensive histological heart damage 7 wk after dosing. These studies show that ICRF-187 provides partial protection from mitoxantrone cardiotoxicity in vitro without impairing the drug's antitumor activity in vitro or in vivo. This facilitates greater cumulative drug dosing in normal mice. The postulated mechanism of cardioprotection is metal chelation, because ICRF-187 did not alter the toxicity of a nonchelating mitoxantrone analogue.","['Shipp, N G', 'Dorr, R T', 'Alberts, D S', 'Dawson, B V', 'Hendrix, M']","['Shipp NG', 'Dorr RT', 'Alberts DS', 'Dawson BV', 'Hendrix M']","['Department of Pharmacology, College of Medicine, University of Arizona, Tucson 85724.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['5AR83PR647 (Razoxane)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Heart Diseases/chemically induced/*prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Experimental/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Mitoxantrone/*antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacology/*toxicity', 'Multiple Myeloma/drug therapy', 'Myocardium/cytology/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Razoxane/*therapeutic use', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1993/02/01 00:00,1993/02/01 00:01,['1993/02/01 00:00'],"['1993/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1993 Feb 1;53(3):550-6.,,,,,,,,"['CA 17094/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 31078/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,

Notable gamma-rays failed to induce c-jun expression in cells pretreated with herbimycin, and the use of cycloheximide did not overcome the inhibitory effects of herbimycin.

The M1 leukemia expressed a high level of bcl-2 and showed a much lower susceptibility to induction of apoptosis by heat shock, Adriamycin, 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine, methotrexate, and cycloheximide, compared to five other leukemias which expressed a low level of bcl-2. There was no association between susceptibility to induction of apoptosis and competence for induction of differentiation. The difference in susceptibility to methotrexate, which is not regulated by the multidrug resistance (MDR) genes, and treatment with verapamil, which blocks MDR activity, have indicated that the higher resistance of the M1 leukemia to these agents was not due to MDR activity. The results indicate that the level of regulated bcl-2 expression in these myeloid leukemias was associated with cell susceptibility to induction of apoptosis by different apoptosis-inducing agents. Screening for expression of bcl-2 may thus be useful to characterize leukemias regarding susceptibility to induction of apoptosis by different agents. The level of regulated c-myc expressed in these leukemias was not associated with susceptibility to induction of apoptosis. Transfection with a deregulated mutant p53 into the M1 leukemia did not change susceptibility to apoptosis induction, but transfection with deregulated c-myc increased susceptibility to apoptosis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Lotem, J', 'Sachs, L']","['Lotem J', 'Sachs L']","['Department of Molecular Genetics and Virology, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cell Growth Differ,Cell growth & differentiation : the molecular biology journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9100024,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*genetics', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/physiology', 'Cycloheximide/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance/genetics', 'Genes, myc/*genetics', '*Hot Temperature', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', 'Mutation/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Transfection/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/*physiology']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cell Growth Differ. 1993 Jan;4(1):41-7.,,,"['bcl-2', 'c-myc']",,,,,,,

Cross-linking the CD3 antigen on streptolysin-O-permeabilized cells stimulated a dose-dependent increase in inositol phosphate production, as did addition of guanosine 5'-[gamma-thio]triphosphate (GTP[S]) or vanadate, a phosphotyrosine phosphatase inhibitor. It was possible, therefore, that the CD3-antigen-mediated production of inositol phosphates was either via a G-protein-dependent mechanism or by stimulation of protein tyrosine phosphorylation. The CD3-induced inositol phosphate production was potentiated by addition of vanadate, but not by addition of GTP[S]. Guanosine 5'-[beta-thio]diphosphate (GDP[S]) inhibited the rise in inositol phosphates induced by GTP[S], vanadate or cross-linking the CD3 antigen. The increase in protein tyrosine phosphorylation stimulated by vanadate or the OKT3 monoclonal antibody was not observed in the presence of GDP[S], showing that in permeabilized HPB-ALL cells, GDP[S] inhibits the actions of tyrosine kinases as well as G-protein function. Addition of either ADP[S] or phenylarsine oxide inhibited CD3- and vanadate-mediated increases in both tyrosine phosphorylation and inositol phosphate production, but did not inhibit GTP[S]-stimulated inositol phosphate production. On the other hand, pretreatment of cells with phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate inhibited subsequent GTP[S]-stimulated inositol phosphate production but did not inhibit significantly inositol phosphate production stimulated by either OKT3 F(ab')2 fragments or vanadate.

The TRF-ADR conjugates were separated by column chromatography and the molar ratio of ADR to TRF (i.e., conjugation number) for the studied conjugates was found to be 1.2. Analysis in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels demonstrated that TRF-ADR conjugates with this molar ratio had the same mobility as native TRF and contained few aggregates. The ADR remained conjugated to TRF under conditions of decreased pH known to occur in many intracellular compartments, and analysis by spectrofluorometry revealed that the conjugated ADR retained its ability to intercalate DNA. The TRF-ADR conjugates were shown by flow cytometry to preferentially bind tumor cells and cell-bound conjugates were found to be laterally mobile within plasma membranes. The binding of TRF-ADR conjugates was determined to be saturable, and competition experiments done with both radioiodinated and fluorescein-labeled TRF-ADR conjugates demonstrated dose-dependent inhibition of conjugate binding by unlabeled TRF, indicating that TRF-ADR conjugates were bound by TRF receptors. Cytotoxicity studies performed with tritiated thymidine incorporation and tetrazolium reduction assays revealed that TRF-ADR conjugates inhibited the proliferation of both K562 and HL60 cells in culture more effectively than free ADR. Such conjugates could provide a delivery system for ADR that would target the drug and possibly diminish its dose-associated complications.","['Berczi, A', 'Barabas, K', 'Sizensky, J A', 'Faulk, W P']","['Berczi A', 'Barabas K', 'Sizensky JA', 'Faulk WP']","['Center for Reproduction and Transplantation Immunology, Methodist Hospital of Indiana, Indianapolis 46202.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Arch Biochem Biophys,Archives of biochemistry and biophysics,0372430,"['0 (Iodine Radioisotopes)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', '0 (Transferrin)', '10028-17-8 (Tritium)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",IM,"['Cell Survival/drug effects', 'DNA Replication/drug effects', 'Doxorubicin/*metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Iodine Radioisotopes', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Protein Binding', 'Radioisotope Dilution Technique', 'Receptors, Transferrin/*metabolism', 'Thymidine/metabolism', 'Transferrin/*metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Tritium', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0003-9861(83)71048-9 [pii]', '10.1006/abbi.1993.1048 [doi]']",ppublish,Arch Biochem Biophys. 1993 Jan;300(1):356-63. doi: 10.1006/abbi.1993.1048.,,,,,,,,,,

The oxidative activation of the benzene metabolite, hydroquinone (HQ), in the bone marrow to the electrophilic benzoquinone (BQ) has been suggested to play an important role in benzene-induced hematotoxicity. Since the interaction of several xenobiotics with copper has been shown to result in their metabolism, in this study we have investigated the role of copper in the oxidation of HQ and HQ-induced toxicity to mice bone marrow stromal cells, target cells of HQ in the bone marrow. In phosphate-buffered saline, HQ underwent autoxidation slowly to BQ, while the presence of Cu(II) ions (1, 2.5, 5, 10, 50 microM) strongly accelerated the oxidation of HQ to BQ in a concentration-dependent manner. Reaction of HQ with Cu(II) was also accompanied by the reduction of Cu(II) to Cu(I), the utilization of O2, and the concomitant generation of H2O2. The oxidation of HQ by Cu(II) could be blocked by the Cu(I)-specific chelator bathocuproinedisulfonic acid (BCS), particularly when the ratio of BCS to Cu(II) was 4:1. By observing the kinetics of the reactions derived from mixing 100 microM HQ and 100 microM Cu(II), it was found that all of the Cu(II) was reduced to Cu(I) within 5 s, followed by consumption of O2 and the generation of BQ, which reached maximum levels at 4 min after mixing HQ and Cu(II). In addition, oxidation of HQ by Cu(II) also generated chemiluminescence. In the presence of myeloperoxidase, Cu(II)-mediated oxidation of HQ was increased. Addition of Cu(II) to primary bone marrow stromal cell cultures significantly enhanced HQ-induced cytotoxicity. The enhanced cytotoxicity of HQ by Cu(II) could be completely prevented by adding BCS, glutathione (GSH), or dithiothreitol but not by catalase. Supplementation of stromal cells with 20 microM BCS in the absence of exogenously added Cu(II) significantly abated HQ-induced cellular GSH depletion and cytotoxicity, suggesting a possible involvement of endogenous copper in the activation of HQ. The above results indicate that Cu(II) strongly induces the oxidation of HQ and as such may be a factor involved in the oxidative activation and toxicity of HQ in target cells.","['Li, Y', 'Trush, M A']","['Li Y', 'Trush MA']","['Department of Environmental Health Sciences, School of Hygiene and Public Health, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland 21205.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Arch Biochem Biophys,Archives of biochemistry and biophysics,0372430,"['0 (Benzoquinones)', '0 (Chelating Agents)', '0 (Hydroquinones)', '0 (Phenanthrolines)', '3T006GV98U (quinone)', '73348-75-1 (bathocuproine sulfonate)', '789U1901C5 (Copper)', 'EC 1.11.1.6 (Catalase)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'T8ID5YZU6Y (Dithiothreitol)', 'XV74C1N1AE (hydroquinone)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Benzoquinones', 'Bone Marrow/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Catalase/pharmacology', 'Cell Survival/*drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chelating Agents/pharmacology', 'Copper/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Dithiothreitol/pharmacology', 'Glutathione/pharmacology', 'Hydroquinones/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Oxygen Consumption/drug effects', 'Phenanthrolines/pharmacology', 'Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0003986183710477 [pii]', '10.1006/abbi.1993.1047 [doi]']",ppublish,Arch Biochem Biophys. 1993 Jan;300(1):346-55. doi: 10.1006/abbi.1993.1047.,,,,,,,,"['ES03760/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'ES03819/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'ES05131/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,

The significance of these unusual splicing patterns and of the higher frequency of proviral insertions adjacent to lck in rats relative to mice is discussed.","['Shin, S', 'Steffen, D L']","['Shin S', 'Steffen DL']","['Division of Molecular Virology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas 77030.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Lymphocyte Specific Protein Tyrosine Kinase p56(lck))']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Lymphocyte Specific Protein Tyrosine Kinase p56(lck)', 'Lymphoma/etiology/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', '*Proto-Oncogenes', '*RNA Splicing', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Rats', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Species Specificity', 'Virus Integration']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncogene. 1993 Jan;8(1):141-9.,,,['lck'],,,,,['CA30674/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['GENBANK/Z15029'],

After birth, hematopoietic cells of the myeloid lineage, and some other terminally differentiated cell types, express high levels of c-fos. Still, the role of fos/jun transcription factors in normal myelopoiesis or in leukemogenesis has not been established. Recently, c-jun, junB, and junD were identified as myeloid differentiation primary response genes stably expressed following induction of terminal differentiation of myeloblastic leukemia M1 cells. Intriguingly, c-fos, though induced during normal myelopoiesis, was not induced upon M1 differentiation. To gain further insights into the role of fos/jun in normal myelopoiesis and leukemogenicity, M1fos and M1junB cell lines, which constitutively express c-fos and junB, respectively, were established. It was shown that enforced expression of c-fos, and to a lesser extent junB, in M1 cells results in both an increased propensity to differentiate and a reduction in the aggressiveness of the M1 leukemic phenotype. M1fos cells constitutively expressed immediate-early and late genetic markers of differentiated M1 cells. The in vitro differentiation of normal myeloblasts into mature macrophages and granulocytes, as well as the increased propensity of M1fos leukemic myeloblasts to be induced for terminal differentiation, was dramatically impaired with use of c-fos antisense oligomers in the culture media. Taken together, these observations show that the proto-oncogenes which encode for fos/jun transcription factors play important roles in promoting myeloid differentiation. The ability of the M1 leukemic myeloblasts to be induced for terminal differentiation in the absence of apparent fos expression indicates that there is some redundancy among the fos/jun family of transcription factors in promoting myeloid differentiation; however, juns alone cannot completely compensate for the lack of fos. Thus, genetic lesions affecting fos/jun expression may play a role in the development of ""preleukemic"" myelodysplastic syndromes and their further progression to leukemias.","['Lord, K A', 'Abdollahi, A', 'Hoffman-Liebermann, B', 'Liebermann, D A']","['Lord KA', 'Abdollahi A', 'Hoffman-Liebermann B', 'Liebermann DA']","['Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia 19104.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Genetic Markers)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA', '*Genes, fos', '*Genes, jun', 'Genetic Markers', 'Hematopoiesis/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Rats', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/02/01 00:00,1993/02/01 00:01,['1993/02/01 00:00'],"['1993/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/mcb.13.2.841-851.1993 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1993 Feb;13(2):841-51. doi: 10.1128/mcb.13.2.841-851.1993.,,,"['c-fos', 'c-jun', 'junB', 'junD']",,PMC358967,,,['1RO1CA43618-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,

Both proteins contain the basic helix-loop-helix motif, a DNA-binding and protein dimerization motif common to several known transcriptional regulatory factors. We now report that serine residue 122 (S122) is a major phosphorylation site of pp42TAL1 in leukemic cell lines and transfected COS1 cells. In vivo phosphorylation of S122 is induced by epidermal growth factor with a rapid time course that parallels activation of the ERK/MAP2 protein kinases. Moreover, S122 is readily phosphorylated in vitro by the extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase ERK1. These data suggest that TAL1 residue S122 serves as an in vivo substrate for ERK/MAP2 kinases such as ERK1. Therefore, S122 phosphorylation may provide a mechanism whereby the properties of TAL1 polypeptides can be modulated by extracellular stimuli.","['Cheng, J T', 'Cobb, M H', 'Baer, R']","['Cheng JT', 'Cobb MH', 'Baer R']","['Department of Microbiology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas 75235.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '135471-20-4 (TAL1 protein, human)', '62229-50-9 (Epidermal Growth Factor)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Epidermal Growth Factor/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3', '*Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Peptide Mapping', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', '*Transcription Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/02/01 00:00,1993/02/01 00:01,['1993/02/01 00:00'],"['1993/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/mcb.13.2.801-808.1993 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1993 Feb;13(2):801-8. doi: 10.1128/mcb.13.2.801-808.1993.,,,,,PMC358963,,,"['CA46593/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK34128/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,

Subsequent findings showed that the same amino-terminal region of E2A is involved in two different translocation events contributing to the induction of a pre-B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and a pro-B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. These results led us to focus on the amino-terminal region of E2A to better understand its normal role in transcriptional regulation and its aberrant involvement in the two leukemias. We report here the identification of two conserved boxes in the E2A amino-terminal domain that show extensive homology within the transactivation domains of E12, E47, E2-2, HEB, and daughterless, all members of the same class of helix-loop-helix proteins. Together, both boxes are crucial for transcriptional activation and have the potential to form a new activation motif, that of a loop adjacent to an amphipathic alpha-helix, designated the loop-helix (LH) motif. A minimal region containing the LH motif is sufficient for transcriptional activation. Point mutations in the amphipathic helix of the minimal region reduce its transactivation capabilities dramatically. The same constructs expressed in yeast cells show identical patterns of activation, suggesting that the LH motif and its target proteins are functionally conserved in yeast cells. We propose that the LH motif represents a novel transactivation domain that is distinct from the previously characterized acidic blob, proline-rich, and glutamine-rich activation motifs. In addition, the LH motif is the first activation motif restricted to one class of DNA binding proteins.","['Quong, M W', 'Massari, M E', 'Zwart, R', 'Murre, C']","['Quong MW', 'Massari ME', 'Zwart R', 'Murre C']","['Department of Biology, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla 92093.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (TCF Transcription Factors)', '0 (TCF7L1 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factor 7-Like 1 Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Conserved Sequence', 'DNA', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Drosophila/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Protein Structure, Secondary', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'TCF Transcription Factors', 'Transcription Factor 7-Like 1 Protein', 'Transcription Factors/*chemistry/genetics/metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Yeasts/genetics']",1993/02/01 00:00,1993/02/01 00:01,['1993/02/01 00:00'],"['1993/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/mcb.13.2.792-800.1993 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1993 Feb;13(2):792-800. doi: 10.1128/mcb.13.2.792-800.1993.,,,,,PMC358962,,,,,

The intracellular concentration was significantly higher than that in the medium and the amount accumulated was dependent on the extracellular concentration. It appears that the uptake of S-(dC)28 involves mechanisms of both fluid-phase pinocytosis and adsorptive endocytosis. Neither oligonucleotides nor 5'-phosphorylated nucleotides inhibited S-(dC)28 uptake. Unlike horseradish peroxidase, which was primarily associated with endosomes once it was taken into the cell, S-(dC)28 was found to be present in both nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions. Efflux of S-(dC)28 from the cell was multiphasic; a trapping mechanism that could be due to a potent interaction of S-(dC)28 with cellular proteins was implicated.

It was hypothesized that IL-3 and GM-CSF might also participate in the local inflammatory cascades that occur at cutaneous blister sites after Ag challenge in vivo. The M-07e megakaryocytic leukemia cell line, which proliferates in response to IL-3 or GM-CSF, was used to determine whether these cytokines were present in fluids derived after Ag challenge in the cutaneous blister chamber model. Fluids from blister chambers after either Ag (timothy grass, orchard grass, or ragweed) or vehicle control challenge were collected hourly for 12 h from nine patients with allergic rhinitis. Cytokine (IL-3/GM-CSF) activity was modestly elevated at 4 h after Ag challenge compared to control with the median of maximal proliferation 4% (range, 2 to 22%) vs 2% (range, 1 to 14%), respectively (Ag vs control, p < 0.03). Activity peaked at 7 h (Ag = 10%, range 1 to 12%, vs control = 1%, range 1 to 9%, p < 0.02) and then steadily declined. No increase in cytokine activity over control was seen in Ag-challenged nonatopics (n = 5, p = NS), indicating that release did not result from a nonspecific effect of the Ag solution. Neutralization of cytokine bioactivity in pooled late phase reaction (LPR) fluids from h 4 to 12 (n = 5) with anti-IL-3, anti-GM-CSF, or both antisera revealed that the majority of the activity was GM-CSF. To better quantify cytokine levels, pooled LPR fluids prepared from an additional 11 subjects were concentration-dialyzed (10x) and tested for cytokine activity. Pooled fluids from Ag-challenged sites contained a median of 625 pg/ml (range, 30 to 1250 pg/ml) GM-CSF equivalents, whereas those from the vehicle control-challenged sites contained a median 30 pg/ml (range, 30 to 300 pg/ml) GM-CSF equivalents (p < 0.004 Ag vs control groups, n = 11). Concentrated fluid from Ag- and control-challenged sites in two nonatopic subjects contained < 10 pg/ml cytokine activity. To evaluate the IL-3 and GM-CSF activity with a separate technique, ELISA were performed on separately pooled blister fluids from six atopic subjects. Although no IL-3 activity was detected after Ag challenge in these six subjects, all of them demonstrated levels of GM-CSF at Ag-challenged sites comparable to that found in the bioassay.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Massey, W', 'Friedman, B', 'Kato, M', 'Cooper, P', 'Kagey-Sobotka, A', 'Lichtenstein, L M', 'Schleimer, R P']","['Massey W', 'Friedman B', 'Kato M', 'Cooper P', 'Kagey-Sobotka A', 'Lichtenstein LM', 'Schleimer RP']","['Johns Hopkins Asthma and Allergy Center, Baltimore, MD 21224-6801.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Allergens)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Allergens/*immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/analysis/*biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Hypersensitivity/*metabolism', 'Interleukin-3/analysis/biosynthesis', 'Skin/*immunology/*metabolism']",1993/02/01 00:00,1993/02/01 00:01,['1993/02/01 00:00'],"['1993/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1993 Feb 1;150(3):1084-92.,,,,,,,,"['AI 07290/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI 20136/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AR 31891/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,

We applied this method to two biopsies performed during aGVHD after semiallogeneic BMT and obtained cytotoxic T cells against four graft mismatches: CD8+ T cells against HLA-A2.2 and HLA-B27 and CD4+ T cells against HLA-DP101 and HLA-DP401. This demonstrates that T cells with documented specificity can be obtained from an aGVHD lesion without antigenic selection.

In these cells, increased expression of multidrug resistance (MDR) genes was demonstrated by Northern blot analysis. The growth-inhibitory effect of doxorubicin, daunorubicin, N,N-dimethyldoxorubicin, N,N-dimethyldaunorubicin, morpholinodoxorubicin, and pyrromycin was comparatively investigated in resistant and wild-type cells. The doxorubicin-resistant F4-6 cells showed approx. 200-fold resistance to doxorubicin and about 100-fold resistance to daunorubicin with respect to the drug-sensitive counterpart. A dramatic decrease in resistance was observed for the N,N-dimethylated derivatives of doxorubicin and daunorubicin as well as for the N,N-dimethylated natural anthracycline pyrromycin and for morpholinodoxorubicin. Uptake studies using [14C]-daunorubicin and [14C]-N,N-dimethyldaunorubicin in resistant F4-6 cells showed a decreased accumulation of daunorubicin but no significant reduction in N,N-dimethyldaunorubicin accumulation as compared with the wild-type cells. Treatment with verapamil led to increased intracellular levels of daunorubicin in resistant cells, whereas an excess of N,N-dimethyldaunorubicin did not have this effect. Thus, the decreased resistance of the doxorubicin-resistant F4-6 cells to the N-alkylated anthracyclines may at least in part be due to a reduced affinity of these compounds for the efflux pump. The results indicate that the dimethylation of the amino group of the anthracycline sugar moiety and its incorporation within a morpholinyl ring may overcome MDR by similar mechanisms.","['Schaefer, A', 'Westendorf, J', 'Lingelbach, K', 'Schmidt, C A', 'Mihalache, D L', 'Reymann, A', 'Marquardt, H']","['Schaefer A', 'Westendorf J', 'Lingelbach K', 'Schmidt CA', 'Mihalache DL', 'Reymann A', 'Marquardt H']","['Department of Toxicology, University of Hamburg Medical School, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Resistance', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/*drug effects', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*drug therapy', 'RNA, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*drug effects']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00685675 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 1993;31(4):301-7. doi: 10.1007/BF00685675.,,,,,,,,,,

Fractions surviving after drug treatment in vitro were determined by colony formation in soft agar. The results, based on the differential sensitivity of the cell populations to ethyldeshydroxysparsomycin (EdSm) and CDDP, indicated that after a short exposure, cultured L1210/CDDP cells were cross-resistant to EdSm.

Treatment of mice bearing L1210/wt leukaemia with combined EdSm and CDDP caused strongly synergistic antitumour activity. In animals bearing the two resistant subclones, however, combined drug treatment did not improve the antitumour activity. The corresponding median survival of mice receiving combined drug treatment was 60 days in each group containing 6 mice bearing L1210/wt, with 4-6 cures being noted; 19 days in animals harbouring L1210/Sm, with 2 cures being recorded among 6 mice; and 11 days in mice bearing L1210/CDDP, with no cure being obtained.

To investigate these features, the molecular organization of the immunoglobulin (Ig) gene region in a case during both the B-CLL and Richter transformation phase was studied. METHODS: B-CLL and non-Hodgkin lymphoma cells were processed for Southern blot analysis of Ig heavy- and light-chain gene configuration. RESULTS: Molecular studies of B-CLL cells revealed the presence of a single Ig heavy-chain rearrangement with both kappa and lambda light-chain rearranged genes, which was consistent with the occurrence of multiple mutational events during the development of the B-CLL clone. Molecular analysis of the lymphoma DNA showed new Ig heavy- and kappa light-chain rearrangements in addition to the original ones related to the CLL phase, indicating that the lymphoma tissue consisted of two genotypically distinct populations of cells. CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of the overall molecular configuration, this heterogeneous pattern of Ig gene rearrangement was interpreted as an inherent genetic instability of the CLL clone, in which multiple mutational events allowed a selective pressure toward more aggressive subclones, resulting in the emergence of the terminal lymphoma.","['Kerim, S', 'Geuna, M', 'Francia di Celle, P', 'Carbone, A', 'Ponti, R', 'Novero, D', 'Foa, R', 'Palestro, G']","['Kerim S', 'Geuna M', 'Francia di Celle P', 'Carbone A', 'Ponti R', 'Novero D', 'Foa R', 'Palestro G']","['Department of Biomedical Sciences and Human Oncology, University of Torino, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Antigens, CD)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/analysis', '*Gene Rearrangement', '*Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/immunology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*genetics/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Syndrome']",1993/01/15 00:00,1993/01/15 00:01,['1993/01/15 00:00'],"['1993/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19930115)71:2<359::aid-cncr2820710215>3.0.co;2-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1993 Jan 15;71(2):359-63. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19930115)71:2<359::aid-cncr2820710215>3.0.co;2-3.,,,,,,,,,,

However, the demonstration of minimal residual disease (MRD) in individual patients is of uncertain prognostic significance because the detection of residual disease has not consistently correlated with subsequent relapse. Moreover, the optimal therapeutic approach in patients with MRD after allogeneic BMT is unknown. The study of these issues has been hindered by the lack of clinically relevant animal models. In this report, we characterize a novel murine model for the study of MRD after allogeneic BMT. This model was designed to simulate high-risk BMT in humans in which patients receive transplants in relapse and disease recurrence in the major cause of treatment failure. The H-2-compatible, mixed lymphocyte culture nonreactive murine strains, AKR (H-2k) and CBA (H-2k), were chosen to parallel marrow transplants from HLA-matched siblings, which represent the majority of allo-transplants in humans. Male AKR leukemia cells were used in female donor/host chimeras permitting the Y chromosome to serve as a leukemia-specific marker for MRD. Detection of residual male leukemia cells in the peripheral blood of the primary host was facilitated by use of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequence-specific oligonucleotide probe hybridization (SSOPH). Use of PCR/SSOPH was highly predictive of clinical outcome (relapse or cure) in animals receiving transplants (P < .00002) and detected disease recurrence earlier than comparative flow cytometric analysis studies. This murine model will be useful in evaluating the efficacy of therapeutic strategies aimed at reducing disease relapse posttransplant and can be adapted to other transplant murine tumor systems for the study of MRD.","['Drobyski, W R', 'Baxter-Lowe, L A', 'Truitt, R L']","['Drobyski WR', 'Baxter-Lowe LA', 'Truitt RL']","['Department of Medicine, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee 53226.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Oligonucleotide Probes)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Female', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*diagnosis/genetics/*surgery', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred AKR', 'Mice, Inbred CBA', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligonucleotide Probes', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Recurrence', 'Spleen/pathology', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Y Chromosome']",1993/01/15 00:00,1993/01/15 00:01,['1993/01/15 00:00'],"['1993/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)74312-0 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1993 Jan 15;81(2):551-9.,,,,,,,,"['CA-39854/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K08-CA01534/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,

Baseline donor and recipient data as well as follow-up data were obtained systematically in all cases by the NMDP. The median interval from the initiation of a search for an unrelated donor to bone marrow transplantation was 8.4 months (range, 1.7 to 34.6 months). Median age of the recipients was 33.3 years (4.5 to 54.5 years). Seventy-five recipients were female and 121 were male. At time of transplant, 115 patients were in chronic phase, 51 in accelerated phase, 14 in blast crisis, and 16 in a second or subsequent chronic phase. In 133 cases, donors and recipients were identical at the HLA A, B, and DR loci using standard serologic typing, and in 63 cases, there was nonidentity at one HLA locus. Patients were prepared for transplantation with a combination of high-dose chemotherapy and total body irradiation (N = 169) or with high-dose chemotherapy only (N = 27). Thirty-five patients received marrow depleted ex vivo of T lymphocytes, whereas 161 patients received non-T-depleted marrow. One hundred seventy-four of 196 patients engrafted (absolute neutrophil count > or = 500/mm3 for 3 consecutive days). The median time to engraftment was 22 days (6 to 69 days). Twenty-two patients failed to engraft, and an additional 10 patients experienced late graft failure. The incidence of grades III or IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was 0.54 +/- 0.10, and that of extensive chronic GVHD was 0.52 +/- 0.12. A lower incidence of both grades III and IV acute GVHD (P = .0003) and of extensive chronic GVHD (P = .01) were independently associated with use of T-depleted marrow. The actuarial incidence of hematologic relapse at 2 years is 0.11 +/- 0.06. The 2-year actuarial incidence of disease-free survival for patients transplanted in first chronic phase within 1 year of diagnosis is 0.45 +/- 0.21, in chronic phase more than 1 year from diagnosis is 0.36 +/- 0.11, in accelerated phase is 0.27 +/- 0.12, in second or subsequent chronic phase is 0.22 +/- 0.21, and in blast crisis is 0.

Over time, however, serum anti-HLA concentrations decrease in approximately 50% of these patients, despite continued exposure to platelet and/or red blood cell transfusions. Using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to measure serum Igs, the present study demonstrates that the sera of 67% of 82 transfused patients exhibiting a decrease in anti-HLA contain antibodies (anti-idiotypes) that react with the variable (V) region of anti-HLA antibodies. Anti-HLA binding to platelet membranes could be inhibited by these serum antibodies in 36% of the patients, indicating they had paratope-related reactivity. Protein G sepharose absorption showed that the anti-HLA V region-reactive antibodies were IgG. Of the 43 patients who had a decrease in anti-HLA levels, that were 16 whose anti-HLA decreased to undetectable levels; 7 (44%) developed anti-idiotypic antibodies that could specifically inhibit their own previously anti-HLA-positive serum. In contrast, antibodies with reactivity to the V region of anti-HLA antibodies (anti-idiotypes) were not demonstrable in patients who developed anti-HLA that did not decrease or disappear. The findings suggest that the development of anti-HLA V region-reactive antibodies (anti-idiotypic antibodies) correlates with a decrease in anti-HLA antibody formation in patients multiply transfused with platelet concentrates. The observations indicate that anti-idiotypic antibodies may downregulate alloimmune responses in patients undergoing repeated allostimulation during platelet transfusion therapy.","['Atlas, E', 'Freedman, J', 'Blanchette, V', 'Kazatchkine, M D', 'Semple, J W']","['Atlas E', 'Freedman J', 'Blanchette V', 'Kazatchkine MD', 'Semple JW']","[""Division of Hematology, St. Michael's Hospital, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic)', '0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Fab Fragments)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Isoantibodies)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic/*blood', '*Blood Component Transfusion', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'HLA Antigens/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Fab Fragments/immunology', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/*blood', 'Isoantibodies/*blood', 'Leukemia/blood/*immunology/*therapy', 'Male']",1993/01/15 00:00,1993/01/15 00:01,['1993/01/15 00:00'],"['1993/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)74310-7 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1993 Jan 15;81(2):538-42.,,,,,,,,,,

We have previously shown that introduction of antisense oligonucleotides into K562 cells could transiently block the expression of P210 and specifically inhibit cellular growth in culture. In this report, we describe the use of a retroviral vector to introduce selected antisense and sense sequences, first into murine B10 cells, previously rendered interleukin-3 (IL-3) independent by transfection of BCR-ABL sequences, and second into K562 cells. The antisense transcripts generated under the control of MoMLV promoter specifically killed B10 cells in the absence of IL-3 and inhibited P210 expression almost completely. In K562 cells, the antisense sequences led to a dramatic reduction of P210 expression and increased their doubling time by more than twofold. This effect was not reversed by the addition of exogenous IL-3 to the culture medium. Control HeLa or HL60 cells infected with the same constructs did not show any change in proliferation rate, despite abrogation of the normal BCR gene products. Rather unexpectedly, P210 suppression was not lethal in K562 cells, showing that such a cell line does not rely entirely on the expression of P210 for surviving, but depends on it as far as growth properties are concerned. We conclude that this approach can successfully achieve stable suppression of the oncogenic protein P210 and may be used to study further the mechanisms by which P210 is transforming cells. The effect on fresh CML cells in bone marrow cultures remains to be assessed before we can tell whether this technique may be used for selective suppression of leukemic hematopoiesis in vitro.","['Martiat, P', 'Lewalle, P', 'Taj, A S', 'Philippe, M', 'Larondelle, Y', 'Vaerman, J L', 'Wildmann, C', 'Goldman, J M', 'Michaux, J L']","['Martiat P', 'Lewalle P', 'Taj AS', 'Philippe M', 'Larondelle Y', 'Vaerman JL', 'Wildmann C', 'Goldman JM', 'Michaux JL']","['Department of Hematology, Cliniques Universitaires Saint-Luc, Brussels, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Codon)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Cell Division/*drug effects', 'Codon/genetics', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/*pharmacology', 'Plasmids', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/01/15 00:00,1993/01/15 00:01,['1993/01/15 00:00'],"['1993/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)74305-3 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1993 Jan 15;81(2):502-9.,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, all-trans retinoic acid has been used to induce remissions in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia, probably through differentiation of the leukemia cells. Myeloblastin (mbn) is a protease that has been identified in the human leukemia cell line HL-60. Downregulation of this protease can inhibit proliferation and induce differentiation of HL-60-derived leukemia cells. Here we have investigated the regulation of mbn messenger RNA (mRNA) expression in two human leukemia cell lines, HL-60 and NB4, treated with all-trans retinoic acid. Under this treatment, downregulation of mbn mRNA was observed in both cell lines, but was considerably delayed in NB4 cells that carry the t(15;17) translocation characteristic of acute promyelocytic leukemia. We have found that multiple mechanisms were involved in the control of mbn mRNA expression. These mechanisms were different in HL-60 and NB4 cells. Our results show that in HL-60 cells, all-trans retinoic acid rapidly decreased transcription of mbn. In contrast, in the t(15;17)-positive NB4 cells treated with all-trans retinoic acid, upregulation of mbn mRNA expression was followed by a late downregulation, both achieved via posttranscriptional mechanisms.","['Labbaye, C', 'Zhang, J', 'Casanova, J L', 'Lanotte, M', 'Teng, J', 'Miller, W H Jr', 'Cayre, Y E']","['Labbaye C', 'Zhang J', 'Casanova JL', 'Lanotte M', 'Teng J', 'Miller WH Jr', 'Cayre YE']","['Department of Physiology, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY 10032.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Serine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.21.76 (Myeloblastin)']",IM,"['Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 15', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'Dactinomycin/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Myeloblastin', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics/metabolism', 'Serine Endopeptidases/*genetics', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/01/15 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1993/01/15 00:00'],"['1993/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1993/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)74301-6 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1993 Jan 15;81(2):475-81.,,,,,,,,,,

A fully infected population showed a relatively high frequency of low-level infection, with 40% of subcloned cells being negative by reverse transcriptase and p24 indirect immunofluorescence analysis and displaying only low levels of supernatant p24. The same treatment of a T-lymphoid cell line produced 100% productive infections. HIV-1 infection of HL-60 did not appear to alter the state of differentiation of the cells, as assessed by surface antigen expression, regardless of the level of viral expression. Furthermore, infected cells were able to respond normally to chemical inducers of differentiation. Induction of differentiation towards monocyte/macrophages by phorbol myristate acetate activated the HIV-1 long terminal repeat in a transient transfection system, and there was a corresponding increase in viral production from the infected subclones. Granulocytic differentiation, as stimulated by dimethyl sulfoxide or retinoic acid, had no effect on long terminal repeat activity and did not stimulate viral replication. These data suggest that low-level HIV-1 infections may be established at a relatively high frequency in myeloid precursor cells, and that different pathways of promyelocytic differentiation vary in their ability to stimulate HIV-1 replication.","['Cannon, P M', 'Tenen, D G', 'Feinberg, M B', 'Shin, H S', 'Kim, S']","['Cannon PM', 'Tenen DG', 'Feinberg MB', 'Shin HS', 'Kim S']","['New England Deaconess Hospital, Boston, MA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', 'EC 2.3.1.28 (Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/*physiology', 'Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase/genetics/metabolism', 'Clone Cells', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', '*HIV Long Terminal Repeat/drug effects', 'HIV-1/genetics/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'NF-kappa B/genetics', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', '*Virus Replication']",1993/01/15 00:00,1993/01/15 00:01,['1993/01/15 00:00'],"['1993/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)74296-5 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1993 Jan 15;81(2):437-45.,,,,,,,,"['AI 29847/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI 30897/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'HL 43510/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,

Unfortunately, the duration of remission is short and most of the patients will experience a relapse of their underlying disease. Autologous bone marrow (BM) transplantation is being explored as a treatment modality designed to improve relapse-free survival. We have conducted a phase II trial exploring the combination of busulfan (16 mg/kg) and etoposide (60 mg/kg) in an attempt to improve antitumor efficacy using this novel preparative regimen. To date, 50 patients (48 with ANLL and 2 patients with biphenotypic acute leukemia) have been treated. The first 20 patients received unmanipulated BM; 28 patients subsequently received 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide (4-HC) (60 micrograms/mL)-purged bone marrow, and 2 patients with biphenotypic acute leukemia received both 4-HC (60 micrograms/mL) and etoposide (5 micrograms/mL)-purged BM. Thirty-four patients were in first complete remission (CR1), 12 patients in second complete remission (CR2), and 4 patients in relapse. The median time from first complete remission to BM harvest was 3 months (range, 0.8 to 4) compared with median time of 2 months (range, 1.5 to 5.0) for patients in second complete remission. The median time from harvest to transplant was 1 month for both groups (range, 0.4 to 36). A median of 0.7 x 10(8) (range, 0.2 to 1.4) mononuclear cells were infused. Patients achieved an absolute neutrophil count of > or = 500/microL at a median of 26 days (range, 13 to 96), an untransfused platelet count > or = 20,000/microL at a median of 56 days (range, 15 to 278) and a sustained hematocrit > or = 30% at a median of 50 days (range, 19 to 116). Twenty-six patients are alive and in continued CR. Follow-up of the surviving patients ranged from 6 months to 66 months with a median follow-up of 31 months. Patients receiving purged BM have an actuarial disease-free survival of 57% with a relapse rate of 28% compared with patients receiving unpurged BM whose actuarial disease-free survival is 32% with a relapse rate of 62% (P = .06 for relapse rate).

Of the first remission patients, there has been 1 treatment related death and 5 relapses. With median follow-up of 22 months, the actuarial relapse rate is 22% +/- 9% and disease-free survival is 76% +/- 9% at 3 years. Patients with favorable French-American-British (FAB) subtypes (M3 or M4 EO) did especially well, with no relapses seen in 15 patients observed for a median of 30 months. Actuarial relapse rate at 3 years was 48% for first remission patients with less favorable FAB subtypes. Of patients in second or third remission, there were 5 treatment related deaths and 4 relapses. With median follow-up of 22 months, the actuarial relapse rate is 25% +/- 11% and disease-free survival is 56% +/- 11% at 3 years. Four of five primary refractory patients died during treatment and 1 remains in remission with short follow-up.

Measurements of intracellular thionucleotide intermediates of 6MP demonstrated a rapid rise of thio-IMP (tIMP) levels, and subsequently a rapid decrease. Thio-GMP (tGMP) and methyl-thio-IMP (Me-tIMP) appeared later in time, and persisted longer. Mycophenolic acid (MPA), a specific inhibitor of IMP dehydrogenase (IMPDH), was used to inhibit the conversion of tIMP into tGMP, thereby decreasing the incorporation of 6MP into DNA. A synergistic effect on cell viability and cell growth was observed when cells were treated with a combination of 2 microM 6MP and 0.5 microM MPA. Also, intracellular Me-tIMP increased 5 times with the combination.

Mutants with deletion of either the N- or C-terminal chain (or both) surrounding the central zinc-finger domain were synthesized by a solid-phase approach in order to evaluate the influence of these lateral chains on zinc binding and conformational properties of NCp10. For this purpose, the steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence properties of the single Trp-35 residue of the various NCp10 derivatives were analyzed. The binding properties of the various derivatives suggest that the central zinc-finger domain affinity for zinc is not modified by the N-terminal chain and is only slightly (about one order of magnitude) increased by the C-terminal chain leading to a Kapp of (1.2 +/- 0.2).10(14) M-1 for the whole NCp10. Concerning the conformation of the NCp10 derivatives, fluorescence data are in agreement with structureless polypeptide chains in the absence of zinc. In contrast, in the presence of zinc, the fluorescence intensity decays are in agreement with a unique conformation of the finger motif backbone and a distribution of the Trp-indole moiety into two classes with different local environments. Decay-associated spectra, fluorescence quenching by acrylamide and anisotropy decay data further suggest that the Trp-indole moiety of both classes was highly exposed to solvent and had a high degree of rotational freedom. Finally, in contrast to the C-terminal chain, the N-terminal chain modifies the local environment and the accessibility to external quenchers of both Trp-35 classes, suggesting that it was folded in the vicinity of the Trp-35 residue.","['Mely, Y', 'de Rocquigny, H', 'Piemont, E', 'Demene, H', 'Jullian, N', 'Fournie-Zaluski, M C', 'Roques, B', 'Gerard, D']","['Mely Y', 'de Rocquigny H', 'Piemont E', 'Demene H', 'Jullian N', 'Fournie-Zaluski MC', 'Roques B', 'Gerard D']","['Laboratoire de Biophysique de la Faculte de Pharmacie, CNRS UA 491, Universite Louis Pasteur, Strasbourg, Illkirch, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Viral Core Proteins)', '129924-33-0 (retroviral nucleocapsid protein NCp10, Moloney murine leukemia', 'virus)', 'EC 3.4.21.4 (Trypsin)', 'J41CSQ7QDS (Zinc)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Fluoroimmunoassay', 'Gene Products, gag/*chemistry', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*chemistry', '*Protein Conformation', 'Trypsin', 'Viral Core Proteins/*chemistry', 'Zinc/metabolism', '*Zinc Fingers']",1993/01/15 00:00,1993/01/15 00:01,['1993/01/15 00:00'],"['1993/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']","['0167-4838(93)90189-X [pii]', '10.1016/0167-4838(93)90189-x [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1993 Jan 15;1161(1):6-18. doi: 10.1016/0167-4838(93)90189-x.,,,,,,,,,,

Topotecan has undergone phase I clinical evaluations in USA, europe, and recently in Japan. DLF are leukopenia and neutropenia. Topotecan is more hydrophilic than its parent compound and shows lesser protein binding. Renal excretion appears to be the major route of elimination. Sobuzoxane (MST-16) is a unique derivative of dioxopiperazine, an inhibitor of topoisomerase II. In phase II studies, definite anticancer effects are observed in patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma. Responses are seen even in pretreated cases. Leukopenia is also dose-limiting. Non-hematologic toxicities are mild and include alopecia and G.I. toxicities.

To demonstrate this, we used DNA-affinity precipitation assay and detected the Tax protein in 21-bp DNA-protein complexes isolated from HTLV-1-infected cells. To identify cellular components in the complexes, we tested various 21-bp DNA-binding proteins by gel electrophoretic mobility-shift assay. Each binding protein gave a shifted band of each 21-bp DNA-protein complex, and exogenously added Tax protein further shifted these bands of cAMP-responsive element (CRE) binding protein (CREB) and CRE modulator but did not shift other bands. Anti-Tax antibodies blocked formation of the complex, indicating complex formations of [Tax-CREB(or CRE modulator)-21-bp DNA]. The formations of these complexes paralleled the functional activities of Tax mutants. Furthermore, the Tax-CREB complex was detected in a nuclear extract of HTLV-1-infected cells, and the Tax-CREB-21-bp-DNA complex was demonstrated as a major component of Tax complexes containing the 21-bp DNA probe. These observations indicate that Tax protein binds to CREB and CRE modulator and the complexes then bind to the 21-bp enhancer, suggesting that the complex binding to the enhancer mediates trans-activation of transcription.","['Suzuki, T', 'Fujisawa, J I', 'Toita, M', 'Yoshida, M']","['Suzuki T', 'Fujisawa JI', 'Toita M', 'Yoshida M']","['Department of Cellular and Molecular Biology, University of Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Nucleoproteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '135844-64-3 (Cyclic AMP Response Element Modulator)', '4QD397987E (Histidine)']",IM,"['Cell Nucleus/chemistry', 'Cyclic AMP Response Element Modulator', 'DNA, Viral/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic/genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Gene Products, tax/*metabolism', 'Histidine', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Nucleoproteins/metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins', 'Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid/*genetics', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', '*Repressor Proteins', 'Transcriptional Activation']",1993/01/15 00:00,1993/01/15 00:01,['1993/01/15 00:00'],"['1993/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.90.2.610 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1993 Jan 15;90(2):610-4. doi: 10.1073/pnas.90.2.610.,,,,,PMC45713,,,,,

It is reported here that IL-6 reduced by 5- to 20-fold the tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins in these cells.

In these stable clones, the levels of tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins were 30- to 100-fold higher than in the parental cells. IL-6 did not reduce the expression levels or the inherent tyrosine kinase activity of BCR-ABL p210. By measuring the protein-tyrosine-phosphatase (PTPase; protein-tyrosine-phosphate phosphohydrolase, EC 3.1.3.48) activity in crude cell lysates, we found that protein dephosphorylation resulted, at least partially, from induction of PTPase activity by IL-6.

This study also was undertaken to examine whether reinforcing the preparation information prior to each LP would be beneficial. The 30 children who participated in the study were divided into three groups: a control group whose members did not receive preparation and two other groups whose members were exposed to different numbers of preparation programs. The parents and the nurse in charge evaluated the children's reactions during treatment using two 6-point rating scales: an anxiety scale and a noncooperation behavior scale. Two unbiased, trained observers later viewed video recordings of the children's reactions and evaluated them using the same tools. In addition, each child rated his or her experience of pain on a 10 cm visual analogue scale. Based on these ratings, the groups were analyzed to determine if within-group differences existed from one treatment to the next and to determine if between-group differences existed at the various times of treatment. Few statistically significant differences were found, but the results indicate that the children in the most informed group exhibited sustained reductions in their perceptions of pain.

Here we transfected VLA-2 alpha 2 subunit cDNA into K562 cells and obtained VLA-2 (called Form-O) which bound to neither collagen nor laminin. We then used a Matrigel selection procedure to enrich for a minor subpopulation of K562 cells stably expressing a form of VLA-2 (Form-C) that bound to collagen but not laminin. In contrast, the same alpha 2 cDNA transfected into RD cells yielded VLA-2 (Form-CL) which bound to both collagen and laminin. These Form-O, -C, and -CL activities were stably expressed during extended cell culture, and could not be qualitatively altered by adding phorbol esters or by exchaning the resident divalent cations. However, addition of stimulatory anti-beta 1 antibodies (TS2/16, A-1A5) rapidly converted VLA-2 Form-O and Form-C into Form-CL. Anti-beta 1 antibody stimulation of VLA-2 activity was observed not only on whole cells, but also with solubilized receptors. These results suggest (a) that the ligand binding specificity of VLA-2 can be determined by its cellular environment, rather than by variations in the primary sequence of the alpha 2 subunit, (b) that stably inactive or partly active VLA-2 can be rapidly converted to a fully active form through conformational changes initiated at a nonligand binding site on the beta 1 subunit, and (c) that the mechanisms for VLA-2 stimulation by phorbol ester and by antibody are quite distinct, because the latter does not require an intact cell.","['Chan, B M', 'Hemler, M E']","['Chan BM', 'Hemler ME']","['Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Cell Biol,The Journal of cell biology,0375356,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Receptors, Very Late Antigen)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*pharmacology', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Line', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA/genetics', 'Extracellular Matrix/physiology', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Receptors, Very Late Antigen/*genetics/immunology/*metabolism', 'Rhabdomyosarcoma', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1083/jcb.120.2.537 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biol. 1993 Jan;120(2):537-43. doi: 10.1083/jcb.120.2.537.,,,,,PMC2119525,,,"['GM38903/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'GM46526/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,

In dividing transfectants, the chimeric molecules were concentrated in the cleavage furrow together with ERM, and both proteins were precisely colocalized throughout the cell cycle.

We further show that the mechanisms of activation of NF-kappa B by the Tax protein involve a cellular inducer. Nuclear extract from lymphoid cells expressing Tax can induce in vitro a NF-kappa B binding activity in nonlymphoid cytosolic extract. This inducer, if preexisting in an inactivate state in T-cells which are not expressing Tax, cannot be switched to an active state by addition of partially purified Tax protein.

In the current study, the levels of t,t-MA in smokers were about 3 times higher than those in nonsmokers (P = 0.0001), and a significant correlation between concentration of t,t-MA and levels of cotinine in smokers was observed (r = 0.55; P = 0.0001; 95% confidence interval, 0.30-0.93), suggesting that urinary t,t-MA can be utilized as a biochemical marker to quantitate benzene exposure due to cigarette smoking.","['Melikian, A A', 'Prahalad, A K', 'Hoffmann, D']","['Melikian AA', 'Prahalad AK', 'Hoffmann D']","['American Health Foundation, Naylor Dana Institute for Disease Prevention, Valhalla, New York 10595.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev,"Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology",9200608,"['0 (Tobacco Smoke Pollution)', '3KD92ZL2KH (muconic acid)', 'AYI8EX34EU (Creatinine)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)', 'K5161X06LL (Cotinine)', 'X045WJ989B (Sorbic Acid)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Benzene/*analysis', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Cotinine/urine', 'Creatinine/urine', 'Environmental Exposure/*analysis', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Pilot Projects', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred F344', 'Smoking/*urine', 'Sorbic Acid/*analogs & derivatives/analysis/chemistry', 'Tobacco Smoke Pollution/*analysis']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev. 1993 Jan-Feb;2(1):47-51.,,,,,,,,"['CA29580/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA44377/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data from 296 patients with CML blastic-phase disease who were referred to our institution between 1967 and 1991 were analyzed. Sixty-eight patients had CML lymphoid blastic-phase disease. Pretreatment characteristics, responses to different therapies, and survival rates were evaluated. RESULTS: Compared with patients having myeloid or undifferentiated blastic-phase disease, those with lymphoid morphology were significantly younger, presented with significantly lesser degrees of anemia, lower white blood cell and peripheral blast counts, higher percentages of marrow blasts, lower lactic dehydrogenase levels, and higher albumin levels. Accelerated-phase CML preceded the blastic phase in 40% of patients with lymphoid disease, compared with 54% of those with other morphologic findings (p = 0.03). The common acute lymphocytic leukemia antigen (CALLA) was expressed on lymphoid blasts in 97% of patients. The incidence of chromosomal abnormalities was similar in the three morphologic categories, although patients with lymphoid disease tended to have a lower incidence of trisomy 8 (17% versus 27%; p = 0.10) and of isochromosome 17 abnormalities (10% versus 17%; p not significant). The incidence of lymphoid blastic phase disease has not increased over the past decade, and it is not higher in patients with the chronic phase of the disease treated with alpha interferon. Patients with lymphoid disease had a significantly higher response rate to chemotherapy during the first salvage (49% versus below 20% for other morphologies; p < 0.001), particularly with vincristine, Adriamycin, and dexamethasone therapy (complete response rate of 61%). Survival during the blastic phase of the disease was also significantly longer in patients with lymphoid morphology than in those with other morphologies (median survival of 9 months versus 3 months; p = 0.01). The benefit associated with lymphoid blastic-phase morphology is brief, and plans for allogeneic bone marrow transplantation or experimental maintenance or consolidation programs should be implemented rapidly. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with CML lymphoid blastic-phase disease have different clinical and laboratory features than patients with other blastic-phase morphologies. In patients developing CML blastic-phase disease, distinguishing those with lymphoid transformation is extremely important because of the different therapeutic requirements (acute lymphocytic leukemia-type therapy) and prognostic implications.","['Derderian, P M', 'Kantarjian, H M', 'Talpaz, M', ""O'Brien, S"", 'Cork, A', 'Estey, E', 'Pierce, S', 'Keating, M']","['Derderian PM', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Talpaz M', ""O'Brien S"", 'Cork A', 'Estey E', 'Pierce S', 'Keating M']","['Department of Hematology, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Med,The American journal of medicine,0267200,,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Blast Crisis/*drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['0002-9343(93)90122-6 [pii]'],ppublish,Am J Med. 1993 Jan;94(1):69-74.,,,,,,,,,,

The donor's PBMC's proliferated vigorously against the recipient's stimulators in the pretransplant mixed lymphocyte cultures (MLC). After transplant reconstitution, MLCs demonstrated that the in vitro response of engrafted donor T cells against host MHC class II antigens was equivalent to control allogeneic responses, while there was no detectable response against the donor's antigens. Posttransplantation limiting dilution analysis showed no difference between the precursor frequencies of antihost responders among populations of fresh donor PBMCs and among the engrafted cells of donor origin that are found circulating in the patient. This result suggests that clonal deletion is, at best, incomplete and that peripheral tolerance is essential in protecting this patient from GVHD.

A 21-year-old man with an acute myelocytic leukemia received a bone marrow graft from a cousin mismatched for a single HLA-DR locus antigen. Hemorrhagic cystitis due to adenovirus type 11 infection occurred 26 days after transplantation, and 17 days later the patients developed acute renal failure. A study of renal tissue obtained by needle biopsy showed degenerative and necrotic lesions, especially in the distal part of the nephron. By electron microscopy adenovirus type 11 particles were found in the nuclei of tubular cells and in cellular debris in tubular lumina. By immunofluorescence technique, granular immune deposits containing adenovirus type 11 related antigen(s), immunoglobulins, C3, and membrane attack complex (MAC) C5b-9 of the complement system were detected along the tubular basement membranes but not in glomeruli. The patient's IgG did not bind to normal human kidneys.

To generate antileukemic immunologic activity, we performed a phase I study using recombinant human interleukin 2 given immediately posttransplantation. This early period was chosen because of low disease burden; therefore induced in vivo effector:target cell ratios might be most favorable. IL-2 was given by continuous infusion (96 hr/week x 3 weeks) beginning day +1. Fourteen patients with high-risk ALL were treated at 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 x 10(6) U/m2/day IL-2. The clinical toxicity, hemopoietic recovery, and immune activation in the IL-2-treated patients was compared with that in a group of autologous BMT patients receiving no IL-2. The patients receiving IL-2 had a trend toward earlier neutrophil, platelet, and RBC recovery plus earlier hospital discharge versus non-IL-2 controls. However, IL-2 plus the inherent toxicity of transplantation often produced hepatic, pulmonary, and renal toxicity. Assessment of immune activation induced by in vivo IL-2 (following 3 weeks of IL-2) showed proliferation of CD8+ T cells having in vitro cytotoxicity against the Nalm-6 ALL cell line in most patients. Little enhancement of natural killer activity by immunophenotype or cytotoxicity against K562 cells was observed. IL-2 given immediately post-BMT induces infrequent but significant toxicity at lower doses than in the non-BMT setting. This toxicity may result from pre-BMT conditioning in conjunction with T cell activation. The immunotherapeutic potential, dose, and schedule of IL-2 following BMT require further study along with measures to reduce its toxicity.","['Weisdorf, D J', 'Anderson, P M', 'Blazar, B R', 'Uckun, F M', 'Kersey, J H', 'Ramsay, N K']","['Weisdorf DJ', 'Anderson PM', 'Blazar BR', 'Uckun FM', 'Kersey JH', 'Ramsay NK']","['Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis 55455.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Transplantation,Transplantation,0132144,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*immunology/mortality', 'Cause of Death', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Interleukin-2/*administration & dosage/blood', 'Killer Cells, Lymphokine-Activated/immunology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*immunology/mortality/surgery', 'Recombinant Proteins/administration & dosage/adverse effects/blood', 'Recurrence', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00007890-199301000-00012 [doi]'],ppublish,Transplantation. 1993 Jan;55(1):61-6. doi: 10.1097/00007890-199301000-00012.,,,,,,,,"['CA21737/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA42633/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-AI-85002/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,

We report here our discovery that N-acetylglucosamine residues within the complex-type N-linked oligosaccharides of both gp120 and its precursor, gp160, are sulfated. When human Molt-3 cells persistently infected with human T-cell leukemia virus IIIB were metabolically radiolabeled with 35SO4, gp160, gp120, and to some extent gp41 were radiolabeled. The 35SO4-labeled oligosaccharides were quantitatively released by N-glycanase treatment and were bound by immobilized Ricinus communis agglutinin I, a lectin that binds to terminal beta-galactosyl residues. The kinetics of release of sulfate upon acid hydrolysis from 35SO4-labeled gp120 indicate that sulfation occurs in a primary sulfate ester linkage. Methylation analysis of total glycopeptides from Molt-3 cells metabolically radiolabeled with [3H]glucosamine demonstrates that sulfation occurs at the C-6 position of N-acetylglucosamine. Fragmentation of the gp120-derived 35SO4-labeled glycopeptides by treatment with hydrazine and nitrous acid and subsequent reduction generated galactosyl-anhydromannitol-6-35SO4, which is the expected reaction product from GlcNAc-6-sulfate within a sulfated lactosamine moiety. Charge analysis of the [3H]galactose- and [3H]glucosamine-labeled glycopeptides from gp120 and gp160 indicates that approximately 14% of the complex-type N-linked oligosaccharides are sulfated.","['Shilatifard, A', 'Merkle, R K', 'Helland, D E', 'Welles, J L', 'Haseltine, W A', 'Cummings, R D']","['Shilatifard A', 'Merkle RK', 'Helland DE', 'Welles JL', 'Haseltine WA', 'Cummings RD']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Oklahoma Health Science Center, Oklahoma City 73104.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (HIV Envelope Protein gp120)', '0 (HIV Envelope Protein gp160)', '0 (HIV Envelope Protein gp41)', '0 (Hydrazines)', '0 (Oligosaccharides)', '0 (Protein Precursors)', '0 (Sulfates)', '0 (Sulfuric Acids)', '27RFH0GB4R (hydrazine)', '9009-86-3 (Ricin)', 'EC 3.5.- (Amidohydrolases)', 'EC 3.5.1.52 (Peptide-N4-(N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminyl) Asparagine Amidase)', 'T2I5UM75DN (Nitrous Acid)', 'V956696549 (Acetylglucosamine)', 'X2RN3Q8DNE (Galactose)']",IM,"['Acetylglucosamine/*analysis', 'Amidohydrolases/metabolism', 'Carbohydrate Sequence', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Galactose/metabolism', 'Gene Products, env/metabolism', 'Glycoproteins/chemistry', 'HIV Envelope Protein gp120/*chemistry/drug effects/metabolism', 'HIV Envelope Protein gp160', 'HIV Envelope Protein gp41/chemistry', 'HIV-1/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydrazines/pharmacology', 'Hydrolysis', 'Methylation', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nitrous Acid/pharmacology', 'Oligosaccharides/biosynthesis/*chemistry', 'Peptide-N4-(N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminyl) Asparagine Amidase', 'Protein Precursors/metabolism', 'Ricin/metabolism', 'Sulfates/metabolism', 'Sulfuric Acids/*analysis']",1993/02/01 00:00,1993/02/01 00:01,['1993/02/01 00:00'],"['1993/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.67.2.943-952.1993 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1993 Feb;67(2):943-52. doi: 10.1128/JVI.67.2.943-952.1993.,,,,,PMC237448,,,"['AI 27135/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA06516/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 AI24845/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,

Here, we report the complete nucleotide sequence of an HTLV-I isolate (designated HTLV-IMEL5) from the Solomon Islands. The overall nucleotide divergence of HTLV-IMEL5 from the prototype HTLV-IATK was approximately 8.5%. The degree of variability in the amino acid sequences of structural genes ranged between 3 and 11% and was higher (8.5 to 25%) for the regulatory (tax and rex) genes and the other genes encoded by the pX region. Since HTLV-IMEL5 was as distantly related to HTLV-II as to the other known HTLV-I strains, it could not have arisen from a reocmbinational event involving HTLV-II but rather might be an example of independent viral evolution in this remote population.

Regulation by the phosphotyrosine phosphatase CD45.,605-16,"The binding and subsequent cross-linking of murine IgG2a or human IgG to the Fc gamma R on the monocytic cell line THP-1 induced a rapid, dose-dependent increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins (a doublet centered around 110 kDa, and bands at 80, 60, and 52 kDa) and smaller increases in other proteins. This phosphorylation was accompanied by an increase in intracellular free Ca2+. The signaling required the cross-linking of the IgG, either through a biotin-avidin complex or with a F(ab')2 second antibody. Cross-linking of an F(ab')2 fragment of mAb 32.2 to Fc gamma RI (CD64) or an Fab fragment of mAb IV.3 to Fc gamma RII (CDw32) gave similar results to those observed with intact murine IgG2a or human IgG. Cross-linking of a F(ab')2 fragment of mAb 3G8 to Fc gamma RIII (CD16) had very little effect. Increases in both tyrosine phosphorylation and intracellular free Ca2+ were significantly reduced in a dose-dependent manner upon treatment of THP-1 cells with the tyrosine kinase inhibitors herbimycin-A, genistein, or erbstatin. Additionally, there was a marked inhibition of both Ca2+ mobilization and tyrosine phosphorylation when a F(ab')2 fragment of a mAb (T191) to the protein tyrosine phosphatase CD45, was co-cross-linked with either Hu-IgG, Mu-IgG2a, F(ab')2 anti-Fc gamma RI, or Fab anti-Fc gamma RII. Taken together these results suggest that signaling through Fc gamma RI (CD64) and Fc gamma RII (CDw32) in the monocytic leukemia cell line THP-1 gives rise to rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins followed by an increase in intracellular calcium. In addition, CD45 is able to inhibit the intracellular signaling when it is brought into close proximity to the Fc gamma R. This suggests that this transmembrane tyrosine phosphatase may regulate the stimulation of the cells through the Fc gamma R.","['Rankin, B M', 'Yocum, S A', 'Mittler, R S', 'Kiener, P A']","['Rankin BM', 'Yocum SA', 'Mittler RS', 'Kiener PA']","['Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceutical Research Institute, Department of Cellular Immunology, Seattle, WA 98121.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Benzoquinones)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Fab Fragments)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Lactams, Macrocyclic)', '0 (Quinones)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)', '1W306TDA6S (Rifabutin)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', '70563-58-5 (herbimycin)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Benzoquinones', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Fab Fragments/physiology', 'Immunoglobulin G/physiology', 'Lactams, Macrocyclic', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Phosphorylation', 'Quinones/pharmacology', 'Receptors, IgG/*physiology', 'Rifabutin/analogs & derivatives', 'Tyrosine/*metabolism']",1993/01/15 00:00,1993/01/15 00:01,['1993/01/15 00:00'],"['1993/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1993 Jan 15;150(2):605-16.,,,,,,,,,,

A 426-bp open reading frame encoded a 142-amino acid polypeptide with a predicted molecular mass of 16.5 kDa and isoelectric point of 7.28. The deduced amino acid sequence of CLC protein showed 20 to 30% similarity over regions of approximately 100 amino acids with the carboxyl-terminal domains of four IgE-binding proteins, including the 31-kDa human and rat IgE-binding proteins, the 35-kDa mouse carbohydrate binding protein (CBP35), Mac-2, the murine macrophage cell surface protein that is identical to CBP35, and the human homologue of Mac-2. These proteins are members of a superfamily of beta-galactoside binding S-type animal lectins, which includes a group of highly conserved 14-kDa lectins isolated from human lung, heart, placenta, bovine heart, chicken skin, mouse fibroblasts, and the electric organ of the electric eel; CLC protein also showed sequence similarities to these 14-kDa animal lectins, including conservation of 7 of 16 invariant amino acid residues thought to comprise the carbohydrate-binding domain of these proteins, with conservative amino acid changes at others; thus, CLC protein could potentially possess carbohydrate or IgE-binding activities. Northern analyses revealed an approximately 900-bp mRNA species that was present in peripheral blood eosinophils from patients with eosinophilia, basophils from patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia, and in HL-60 cells induced towards eosinophilic differentiation with B cell growth factor-II (IL-5) or granulocytic differentiation with DMSO, but was absent in neutrophils, monocytes, T cells, B cells, or HL-60 cells induced towards monocytic differentiation with vitamin D3. Southern analyses revealed a gene of approximately 5 to 6 kb in length.

Apoptotic cell death is preceded by many changes in cellular properties, such as glucose metabolism, cell size, cell density, and others. In this study, 19F-NMR has been used to characterize changes in cell membrane potential and intracellular accessible volume during dexamethasone induced apoptosis. One dex-sensitive (CEM-C7) and three dex-resistant variants (CEM-C1, CEM-ICR27, and CEM-4R4) were examined. We have observed separate intracellular and extracellular resonances for trifluoroacetate and trifluoroacetamide added to suspended leukemic cells. From the equilibrium distribution of these fluoro-compounds between intra and extracellular spaces, the changes in membrane potential and intracellular accessible volume were calculated. The membrane potential for CEM-C7 cells was found to significantly decrease in the presence of dexamethasone (9-mV decrease within 18 h of dexamethasone treatment), while that of CEM-ICR27 was found in some samples to increase on dexamethasone incubation. The membrane potential for CEM-C1 decreased slightly, while that of CEM-4R4 was not appreciably affected by dexamethasone. The reduction of membrane potential seems to be an early step in the mechanism of dexamethasone induced apoptosis. Although the intracellular volume varied with cell type and dexamethasone incubation (for CEM-C7), the fractional intracellular volume (alpha = Vin/Vcell) was found to be the same (0.82 +/- 0.06) for all the cell lines in the presence and absence of dexamethasone.","['Adebodun, F', 'Post, J F']","['Adebodun F', 'Post JF']","['Department of Human Biological Chemistry and Genetics, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston 77555-0653.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,['7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)'],IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', '*Membrane Potentials', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.1041540123 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 1993 Jan;154(1):199-206. doi: 10.1002/jcp.1041540123.,,,,,,,,,,

M-MuLV IN was highly active for integration as measured by in vitro cleavage and strand transfer assays. Furthermore, the integration of a model viral substrate into lambda concatamers by IN correctly produced the flanking 4-base pair duplications characteristic of M-MuLV IN. The reverse reaction of integration, disintegration, was also catalyzed by the recombinant M-MuLV IN. Two products were generated, a 3'-recessed long terminal repeat and a ligated target DNA, from a model integration-intermediate substrate in the presence of M-MuLV IN. The requirements and optimal conditions for maximal integration and disintegration activity for M-MuLV IN were determined. The forward and reverse reactions required different concentrations of manganese ion and reductant. Salt was also titrated for the forward and reverse reactions.

In this system (6R)-DDATHF showed an influx Km of 1.49 microM and a decreased influx Vmax of 0.60 pmol/min/10(7) cells. A similar effect was shown for MTX (Km of 7.48 microM, Vmax of 1.02 pmol/min/10(7) cells). The number of binding sites in CCRF-CEM cells was similar for (6R)-DDATHF, (6S)-DDATHF, and MTX, 0.74, 0.71, and 0.76 pmol/10(7) cells, respectively. These values were slightly higher in the CEM/MTX cell line (1.07 and 1.09 pmol/10(7) cells for (6R)-DDATHF and MTX, respectively). Treatment of CCRF-CEM cells with either the N-hydroxysuccinimide ester of MTX or the corresponding N-hydroxysuccinimide ester of (6R)-DDATHF caused substantial inhibition (> 90%) of the influx of (6R)-[3H]DDATHF and [3H]MTX, respectively. These results suggest strongly that DDATHF and MTX share a common influx mechanism through the reduced folate transport system. The internalization of DDATHF by monkey kidney epithelial MA104 cells, which express a high affinity folate receptor, was also studied. Competitive binding studies using purified folate receptor and radiolabeled 5-methyltetrahydrofolate showed that (6S)- and (6R)-DDATHF both had I50 values lower than 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (12 nM). Further studies indicate that both DDATHF isomers are actively intracellularly concentrated through this route and are also rapidly converted to high chain length polyglutamates. Transport via this system was inhibited in folate-depleted cells by 10 nM folic acid.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Pizzorno, G', 'Cashmore, A R', 'Moroson, B A', 'Cross, A D', 'Smith, A K', 'Marling-Cason, M', 'Kamen, B A', 'Beardsley, G P']","['Pizzorno G', 'Cashmore AR', 'Moroson BA', 'Cross AD', 'Smith AK', 'Marling-Cason M', 'Kamen BA', 'Beardsley GP']","['Department of Pediatrics, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut 06510.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Folate Receptors, GPI-Anchored)', '0 (Folic Acid Antagonists)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Tetrahydrofolates)', '10028-17-8 (Tritium)', '6P3AVY8A7Q (lometrexol)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Biological Transport', 'Carrier Proteins/*metabolism', 'Drug Resistance', 'Folate Receptors, GPI-Anchored', 'Folic Acid Antagonists/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid', 'Methotrexate/metabolism', '*Receptors, Cell Surface', 'Stereoisomerism', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Tetrahydrofolates/*metabolism', 'Tritium', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/01/15 00:00,1993/01/15 00:01,['1993/01/15 00:00'],"['1993/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(18)54035-7 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1993 Jan 15;268(2):1017-23.,,,,,,,,"['CA42367/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA57320/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'RR01237/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,

In order to investigate whether similar processes are important in the proliferation of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) cells of precursor-B type, the expression of various adhesion molecules was examined. By flow cytometry analysis, CD-44 and the integrins VLA-4 and VLA-5 were the most prominent. CD-44 and VLA-4 were expressed on all 18 cases of precursor-B ALL analysed, while VLA-5 was found on 15 of 18 cases. The integrin CD-11a was detected on 8 of 11 cases, while its ligand, CD-54, was present in 6/12. Other adhesion proteins such as beta 3 integrin, CD-56, CD-15, and Leu8 were not expressed to any significant extent. In view of the known binding of VLA-4 and VLA-5 to extracellular fibronectin (FN), the adhesion of leukaemic cells to FN was evaluated in a colorimetric assay. The precursor-B ALL cell lines REH and KM-3, and 7/15 cases of precursor-B ALL, showed detectable binding to FN. Binding to the other extracellular matrix proteins collagen type 1 and vitronectin was not observed, although two ALL cases showed some binding to laminin. The functional activity of the VLA-4 and VLA-5 molecules was examined using an inhibitory peptide and monoclonal antibodies. These studies indicated that ALL cells adhere to soluble fibronectin predominantly through the VLA-5 molecule (blockable with the PHM-2 antibody and a peptide containing the RGD sequence) although binding mediated by VLA-4 was also apparent in some experiments (blockable by a 40 kDa fragment containing the heparin-binding domain of FN and inhibitory antibodies). These results indicate that precursor-B ALL cells may adhere to marrow stroma through interaction of VLA-4 and VLA-5 with FN, although other mechanisms of adhesion may be important.","['Makrynikola, V', 'Bradstock, K F']","['Makrynikola V', 'Bradstock KF']","['Haematology Department, Westmead Hospital, New South Wales, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Extracellular Matrix Proteins)', '0 (Fibronectins)', '0 (Integrins)', '0 (Laminin)', '0 (Peptides)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antigens, CD/*metabolism', 'B-Lymphocytes/*cytology', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', '*Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/*metabolism', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Extracellular Matrix Proteins/metabolism', 'Female', 'Fibronectins/metabolism', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Integrins/metabolism', 'Laminin/metabolism', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Peptides/chemistry/metabolism', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1993 Jan;7(1):86-92.,,,,,,,,,,

Four monoclonal antibodies (CD15, CD24, 31D8, and 13F6) were used, and a total number of 116 sequential studies were performed in 43 patients. At diagnosis, there is a significant decrease of NG expressing myeloid differentiation antigens, which recover to nearly normal levels after initial control of the disease. The onset reduction is probably due to the circulation of incompletely mature NG. In accelerated/blastic phase NG expressing myeloid differentiation antigens decrease again, probably due to a true antigen loss. This reduction could herald by a few months the development of accelerated/blastic phase. In such a case, its predictive strength is higher than that of the well recognized initial prognostic parameters in CML. These results indicate that the sequential study of NG myeloid differentiation antigens may contribute to both a better understanding of the natural history of CML and the evolutive prognosis of this disease.","['Rozman, M', 'Cervantes, F', 'Urbano-Ispizua, A', 'Feliu, E', 'Vives-Corrons, J L', 'Rozman, C']","['Rozman M', 'Cervantes F', 'Urbano-Ispizua A', 'Feliu E', 'Vives-Corrons JL', 'Rozman C']","['Postgraduate School of Haematology Farreras Valenti, Hospital Clinic, University of Barcelona, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/*analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*immunology/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Accelerated Phase/immunology/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Neutrophils/*immunology', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Analysis', 'Time Factors']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1993 Jan;7(1):80-5.,,,,,,,,,,

Blast cell colony formation from seven normal bone marrow (NBM) samples was studied in parallel. Blast cell colonies were formed in 7/8 cases of MDS, the numbers not significantly differing from those generated by NBM. In contrast the more mature hematopoietic progenitors (granulocyte-erythroid-macrophage-megakaryocyte colony-forming unit, CFU-GEMM; erythroid burst-forming units, BFU-E; granulocyte colony-forming units, CFU-G; eosinophilic colony-forming units, CFU-Eo) were severely depressed in numbers in MDS marrow. After replating of blast cell colonies in secondary cultures, colonies were obtained in 5/8 MDS cases. A marked difference was evident in the composition of the secondary colonies between MDS and normal marrow. Whereas secondary colonies derived from normal blast cell colonies consisted of about 45% of erythroid cells, MDS blast colonies generated mainly colonies of the granulocytic-monocytic lineage and no erythroid colonies. The normal quantitative level of CFU-blast progenitors in MDS in the context of their impaired ability to generate lineage specific progeny upon secondary plating suggests that the incompetence of maturation of MDS may reside in the CFU-blast progenitor cell being incapable of properly responding to growth factor stimulation.","['Backx, B', 'Broeders, L', 'Touw, I', 'Lowenberg, B']","['Backx B', 'Broeders L', 'Touw I', 'Lowenberg B']","['Dr Daniel den Hoed Cancer Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/pathology', 'Female', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/pathology/*physiopathology']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1993 Jan;7(1):75-9.,,,,,,,,,,

Using the polymerase chain reaction the gene for the alpha chain was shown to be expressed in 18/18 primary myeloid as well as 8/8 primary lymphoid leukemias analysed. To investigate the integrity of the mRNA, polymerase chain reactions (PCR) using a combination of oligonucleotides spanning the entire coding region of the alpha chain were performed. Normal sized fragments were generated with all combinations of oligonucleotides from all but one leukemia. One chronic lymphoid leukemia displayed an apparent alteration at the 3' end of the 3' untranslated region of the alpha chain mRNA. No polymorphisms were detected in the beta chain gene which was also not rearranged in any of the samples analysed. The beta chain mRNA was expressed in 17/18 primary myeloid and 7/8 primary lymphoid leukemias and in those leukemias there was no evidence for any lesions in the mRNA, as judged by PCR fragment size.

In this paper we demonstrate the presence of an altered cytoplasmic MT network in MOLT-4 and HuT-78 leukemic cells (human T-cell leukemic lines) compared to normal human peripheral blood lymphocytes stimulated with mitogens. In addition, using a selective extraction protocol we have compared microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) profiles of G1/S synchronized leukemic human T-cells and 20 h mitogen-stimulated human peripheral blood T-cells. We observed a dramatic decrease in the expression of a MAP of apparent molecular weight 52 kDa and pI 5.2 in the leukemic cells synchronized at the G1/S border of the cell cycle.

Primary fibrinogenolysis, mediated by the release of leukocyte proteases, may also contribute to this disorder. We analyzed coagulation parameters in 15 non-septic APL patients. Before treatment, there was evidence of thrombin activation with DIC: increased levels of circulating thrombin-antithrombin III complexes, prothrombin fragments 1 + 2 and D-Dimer complexes. This DIC syndrome was probably limited, since no prothrombin time decrease, no significant factor V consumption, and normal levels of coagulation inhibitors (antithrombin III and protein C) were observed in APL patients when compared to normal controls. In this context, marked hypofibrinogenemia suggested primary fibrinogenolysis as the predominant etiology. Despite normal or high tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1) antigen levels, the plasma PAI-1 activity and the formation of tPA/PAI-1 complexes were lower in APL patients than in normal controls, suggesting a proteolytic degradation of PAI-1, not able to complex tPA. Two other fibrinolytic inhibitor molecules (alpha-2 plasmin inhibitor antigen and histidine-rich glycoprotein antigen) were also significantly reduced, as well as the two subunits of fibrin stability factor XIII, although only subunit A is known to be susceptible to thrombin action. Evidence of degraded forms of von Willebrand factor in the plasma suggested an extended proteolytic activity. Four patients treated with all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) as a single differentiating agent were studied serially. A dissociation between these two syndromes--DIC and fibrinogenolysis/proteolysis--was observed. The rapid correction of the lysis markers contrasted with a more prolonged persistence of the procoagulant activity. We observed persistently high elastase/alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor complex levels during ATRA therapy, despite progressive correction of all lysis markers. Thus, the release of elastase from promyelocytic leukemic cells is probably not the only determinant of the fibrinogenolytic/proteolytic syndrome. In summary, the present findings provide new arguments for the association of DIC and proteolysis syndromes in APL-associated coagulation disorders. Further prospective studies are needed in order to confirm the persistence of thrombin activation in course of ATRA therapy.","['Dombret, H', 'Scrobohaci, M L', 'Ghorra, P', 'Zini, J M', 'Daniel, M T', 'Castaigne, S', 'Degos, L']","['Dombret H', 'Scrobohaci ML', 'Ghorra P', 'Zini JM', 'Daniel MT', 'Castaigne S', 'Degos L']","['Service Clinique des Maladies du Sang, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Fibrin Fibrinogen Degradation Products)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '9001-31-4 (Fibrin)', '9001-32-5 (Fibrinogen)', 'EC 3.4.21.5 (Thrombin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Child', 'Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation/drug therapy/*physiopathology', 'Female', 'Fibrin/metabolism', 'Fibrin Fibrinogen Degradation Products/metabolism', 'Fibrinogen/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*blood/complications/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prospective Studies', 'Thrombin/metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Tretinoin/*therapeutic use']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1993 Jan;7(1):2-9.,,,,,,,,,,

We describe the characterization and application of PCR for the amplification of Y-chromosome-specific DNA in blood cells recovered from stored slides. Four different primer pair combinations were used. PCR can be rapidly performed on stained or unstained slide material with varying sensitivity--depending on the primer combination. The lowest limit of detection is one male cell in 500-1000 female cells. The technique was applied to follow the early post-transplant course of 15 male patients who received grafts from female donors and found a high incidence of mixed chimerism during the first three months after BMT and a striking fluctuation between positive and negative results in the follow-up of individual patients.

In this way leukemic cells were genetically marked. Ten independent cell lines were characterized during in vitro growth as well as during two subsequent in vivo passages for expression of neo(r) for which the neomycin analogue G418 was used, and for lacZ expression for which the substrate 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-beta-D-galactopyranoside (X-gal) was used. Out of 10 lines, four revealed permanent high expression of lacZ in all cells. In four other lines greatly varying lacZ expression between the individual cells from these lines was observed. In the remaining two lines lacZ expression was gradually lost. In contrast, neo(r) expression was gradually lost in eight out of the 10 lines, particularly rapidly during in vivo passaging. In the remaining two lines neo(r) expression was retained. The genetic modification did not alter the in vitro leukemogenicity of the cells. Long term in vivo expression of neo(r) and lacZ was followed in two selected lines up to 12 subsequent passages, i.e. one from the group of homogeneous high lacZ expression and one from the group of heterogeneous lacZ expression. In both lines lacZ expression was retained whereas neo(r) expression was rapidly lost after the third passage. The feasibility of using genetically marked leukemic cells for studies of minimal residual disease (MRD) was explored by injecting rats with leukemic cells, treating them with chemotherapy at full blown leukemia development to reduce the tumor load, mimicking the induction of a state of MRD and studying lacZ expression at relapse. LacZ expression was evident in 100% of the cells whereas neo(r) expression was lost in a considerable fraction. These results indicate that the viral vector BAG can be used to mark leukemia cells genetically although a selection of clones with the desired stability of long-term expression is required.","['Yan, Y', 'Martens, A C', 'de Groot, C J', 'Hendrikx, P J', 'Valerio, D', 'van Bekkum, D W', 'Hagenbeek, A']","['Yan Y', 'Martens AC', 'de Groot CJ', 'Hendrikx PJ', 'Valerio D', 'van Bekkum DW', 'Hagenbeek A']","['Institute of Applied Radiobiology and Immunology (ITRI)/TNO Rijswijk, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA, Recombinant)', 'EC 2.3.1.- (Acetyltransferases)', 'EC 2.3.1.- (aminoglycoside acetyltransferase)', 'EC 3.2.1.23 (beta-Galactosidase)']",IM,"['Acetyltransferases/genetics', 'Animals', 'Biomarkers', 'Blotting, Southern', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'DNA, Recombinant/genetics', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Leukemia, Experimental/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred BN', 'Retroviridae', 'Time Factors', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'beta-Galactosidase/genetics']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1993 Jan;7(1):131-9.,,,,,,,,,,

We have recently reported that the accepted technique for sorting stem cells on the basis of high affinity for the lectin wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) did not select for cells initiating long-term production of new stem cells on a stromal layer in vitro. We have therefore reinvestigated the expression of cell surface sialic acid residues in the hemopoietic stem cell compartment by sorting murine bone marrow cells on the basis of affinity for WGA. Frequency analysis of long-term bone marrow culture initiating stem cells was done using the cobblestone-area-forming cell (CAFC) assay with limiting dilution set-up. In vivo stem cell quality was determined by spleen colony formation, marrow-repopulating ability (MRA) and long-term repopulating ability (LTRA) using sex-mismatched hemopoietic chimerism. The data indicate that MRA and LTRA in vivo and in vitro are among the most WGA-dim cells. In contrast, the enrichment factors for splenic colony-forming units (CFU-S) at day 12 and transient CAFC increase with increasing WGA affinity. These characteristics allowed us to concentrate LTRA cells 590- to 850-fold over their activity in normal bone marrow without significant enrichment of day-12 CFU-S. The data reveal that WGA affinity is an inverse function of the primitiveness of murine hemopoietic stem cells and that long-term production of blood cells in vivo and in vitro is provided for by primitive cells that are physically separable from the vast majority of day-12 CFU-S. In addition the data reveal, that the CAFC frequency at day 28-35 of a graft strongly correlates with the number of cells required to induce 40% donor-type chimerism at 15 months post-transplantation and thus predicts the in vivo LTRA of a graft.","['Ploemacher, R E', 'van der Loo, J C', 'van Beurden, C A', 'Baert, M R']","['Ploemacher RE', 'van der Loo JC', 'van Beurden CA', 'Baert MR']","['Institute of Hematology, Erasmus University, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,['0 (Wheat Germ Agglutinins)'],IM,"['Animals', '*Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Separation', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'Magnetics', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Wheat Germ Agglutinins/*metabolism']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1993 Jan;7(1):120-30.,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between October 1985 and March 1988, 278 patients were accrued to a multi-institutional, randomized clinical trial. Responding patients were treated for 2 years before termination of therapy. RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 23 months, the overall remission rate for the melphalan/prednisone treatment group was 44% compared with 33% for the group receiving melphalan/prednisone/interferon alfa-2b. The durations of response and survival were identical for the two treatment groups. Median survival was 3.17 years on melphalan/prednisone treatment and 3.0 years on melphalan/prednisone/interferon alfa-2b treatment. Both hematologic and nonhematologic toxicities were greater in the melphalan/prednisone/interferon alfa-2b treatment group, but were usually of a mild or moderate degree and did not interfere with the completion of therapy. The frequency of deaths in the two treatment groups attributable to the treatment itself was similar. CONCLUSION: This study shows no advantage to the concomitant delivery of interferon alfa-2b with standard melphalan and prednisone as initial treatment for patients with multiple myeloma.","['Cooper, M R', 'Dear, K', 'McIntyre, O R', 'Ozer, H', 'Ellerton, J', 'Canellos, G', 'Bernhardt, B', 'Duggan, D', 'Faragher, D', 'Schiffer, C']","['Cooper MR', 'Dear K', 'McIntyre OR', 'Ozer H', 'Ellerton J', 'Canellos G', 'Bernhardt B', 'Duggan D', 'Faragher D', 'Schiffer C']","['Bowman Gray School of Medicine/Wake Forest University, Winston-Salem, NC.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Interferon alpha-2)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'Q41OR9510P (Melphalan)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interferon alpha-2', 'Interferon-alpha/administration & dosage', 'Male', 'Melphalan/administration & dosage', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/*drug therapy', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Survival Analysis']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1993.11.1.155 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1993 Jan;11(1):155-60. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1993.11.1.155.,,,,,,,,"['U10 CA032291/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA033601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA035421/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 33601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 04326/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 03927/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients (n = 5) received 1 g/m2 of ara-C infused intravenously (IV) for 2 hours, followed at 20 hours by 30 mg/m2 of fludarabine for 30 minutes. At 24 hours, another identical dose of ara-C was infused. To determine the optimal duration of ara-C infusion following fludarabine, five additional patients were treated on an amended protocol in which the ara-C infusion was extended to 3 g/m2 infused over 6 hours. RESULTS: Comparison of ara-CTP pharmacokinetics in circulating AML cells demonstrated that the area under the curve (AUC) of ara-CTP increased significantly (median, 1.8-fold; range, 1.6 to 2.4; P = .004) after fludarabine infusion. Neither the median plasma ara-C concentrations, the levels of its deamination product arabinosyluracil, nor the rate of ara-CTP elimination from circulating blasts was affected by fludarabine infusion. However, the rate of ara-CTP accumulation by AML cells was increased by a median of 2.0-fold (range, 1.8 to 2.2; P = .001) after fludarabine; the peak occurred within 1 hour of the end of the infusion. In vitro incubation of these cells with arabinosyl-2-fluoroadenine (F-ara-A) before ara-C also produced a median 1.7-fold increase in the ara-CTP accumulation rate. Pharmacology studies in patients receiving 6-hour infusions of ara-C demonstrated that the rate of ara-CTP accumulation was potentiated beyond 2 hours, but not for 6 hours. CONCLUSION: Infusion of fludarabine before ara-C augments the rate of ara-CTP synthesis in circulating AML blasts during therapy. Evaluation of 6-hour ara-C infusions demonstrated that potentiation of ara-CTP synthesis is maximal up to 4 hours in most patients; this pharmacologically optimized regimen should be considered for combination with other antileukemia drugs.","['Gandhi, V', 'Estey, E', 'Keating, M J', 'Plunkett, W']","['Gandhi V', 'Estey E', 'Keating MJ', 'Plunkett W']","['Department of Medical Oncology, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/blood/*pharmacokinetics', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/*drug therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Recurrence', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1993.11.1.116 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1993 Jan;11(1):116-24. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1993.11.1.116.,,,,,,,,"['CA32839/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA53311/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA57629/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,

(1988) reported that replacing the casein in our standard semisynthetic diet with soy protein markedly decreases the progression of nephropathy with advancing age in ad libitum fed male F344 rats. In the present study, it is shown that replacing the casein with lactalbumin does not decrease the occurrence of severe nephropathy in ad libitum fed rats. It is also shown that dietary restriction (DR) studies can be effectively executed in the male F344 rat when soy protein is the source of dietary protein. It is further shown that when the energy intake of the rats fed soy protein-containing diets was reduced to 60% of the ad libitum intake, almost one-third of the rats died with an absence of severe morphologic lesions, that is, lesions which contribute to the death of the rat. It is concluded that the male F344 rat is an excellent model for aging research when soy protein is the source of dietary protein; no single disease process was found to be primarily responsible for death with such a diet.","['Shimokawa, I', 'Higami, Y', 'Hubbard, G B', 'McMahan, C A', 'Masoro, E J', 'Yu, B P']","['Shimokawa I', 'Higami Y', 'Hubbard GB', 'McMahan CA', 'Masoro EJ', 'Yu BP']","['Department of Physiology, University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Gerontol,Journal of gerontology,0374762,"['0 (Caseins)', '0 (Dietary Proteins)', '0 (Plant Proteins, Dietary)', '0 (Soybean Proteins)', '9013-90-5 (Lactalbumin)']",IM,"['*Aging', 'Animals', 'Body Weight', 'Caseins/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Cause of Death', 'Dietary Proteins/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Disease/etiology', '*Disease Models, Animal', 'Eating', 'Heart Diseases/etiology', 'Kidney Diseases/*etiology/prevention & control', 'Lactalbumin/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/etiology', 'Longevity', 'Lymphoma/etiology', 'Male', 'Plant Proteins, Dietary/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Rats', '*Rats, Inbred F344', 'Soybean Proteins', '*Soybeans']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/geronj/48.1.b27 [doi]'],ppublish,J Gerontol. 1993 Jan;48(1):B27-32. doi: 10.1093/geronj/48.1.b27.,,,,,,,,['AG-01188/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States'],,

CS-IIA showed CD4 dominance during the early culture. However, after addition of IL-2, CS-IIA predominantly co-expressed CD4 and CD8 (69.5%) and also expressed the surface markers CD1-, CD3+, CD19-, CD25+ and HLA-DR+. A significantly elevated level of IL-4 (1697 pg/ml) was observed in the culture supernatant from CS-IIA. In addition, the conversion of phenotype from some CD4+CD8+ cells to CD4+CD8- was demonstrated by the neutralization assay using anti-IL-4 antibody. CS-IIA had a normal human karyotype and was free from Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen and immunoreactive with sera of HTLV-I- or HTLV-II-infected patients and anti-HTLV-1, p19 or p24 mAb. The provirus genome of HTLV-II was detected in this cell line by the polymerase chain reaction combined with a digoxigenin-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. However, electron microscopy of CS-IIA cells revealed no C-type virus particles in the extracellular space. These results indicate that HTLV-II can be transmitted from an HTLV-II-infected simian leukocyte cell line to human cord T lymphocytes and suggest that co-expression of CD4 and CD8 on T cells may be induced by the high level of IL-4, which can mediate CD8 induction on CD4+ T cell clones.","['Hayashi, K', 'Ohara, N', 'Fujiwara, K', 'Aoki, H', 'Jeon, H J', 'Takahashi, K', 'Tomita, N', 'Miyamoto, K', 'Akagi, T']","['Hayashi K', 'Ohara N', 'Fujiwara K', 'Aoki H', 'Jeon HJ', 'Takahashi K', 'Tomita N', 'Miyamoto K', 'Akagi T']","['Second Department of Pathology, Okayama University Medical School, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol,Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology,7902060,['207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)'],IM,"['*CD4-CD8 Ratio', 'Genome, Viral', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 2/isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Interleukin-4/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/metabolism/microbiology/*pathology', 'Male', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF01229527 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol. 1993;119(3):137-41. doi: 10.1007/BF01229527.,,,,,,,,,,

The formation of mixed colonies composed of erythroblasts and myeloblasts in the absence of erythropoietin or colony-stimulating factor may indicate the deranged hematopoiesis in erythroleukemia.","['Nara, N', 'Tanikawa, S', 'Shiina, S']","['Nara N', 'Tanikawa S', 'Shiina S']","['Laboratory Medicine, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,,IM,"['Adult', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cell Count', 'Erythroblasts/*pathology', 'Granulocytes/*pathology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1993 Jan;21(1):98-102.,,,,,,,,,,

We therefore analyzed samples obtained from 57 patients with a variety of hematologic malignancies (21, acute myelogenous leukemia; 14, acute lymphoblastic leukemia; 12, Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia [blast phase] or acute leukemia; 5, chronic lymphocytic leukemia; and 5, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia) for expression of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) transcripts on Northern blots. TNF-alpha mRNA was discerned in almost half of the samples (47%), and was expressed in some patients with every type of leukemia, except T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Expression occurred with great frequency in samples (12 of 15 [80%]) from monocytic (acute or chronic) leukemias, and from advanced chronic lymphocytic leukemia (4 of 5 samples [80%]). IL-1 beta transcripts were detected in 20 of 57 samples (35%). Its presence, like that of TNF-alpha, was ubiquitous, and only chronic lymphocytic leukemia and T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells consistently failed to produce IL-1 beta message. Therefore it appears that TNF-alpha and/or IL-1 beta mRNA can be found in the leukemic cells from a substantial subset of patients with B cell-derived acute lymphoblastic leukemia as well as with chronic and acute myeloid, monocytic or lymphocytic leukemias. Because these cytokines have potent direct and indirect effects on normal and malignant hematopoiesis, their widespread constitutive expression by neoplastic blood cells may play a fundamental role in driving the leukemic process.","['Kurzrock, R', 'Kantarjian, H', 'Wetzler, M', 'Estrov, Z', 'Estey, E', 'Troutman-Worden, K', 'Gutterman, J U', 'Talpaz, M']","['Kurzrock R', 'Kantarjian H', 'Wetzler M', 'Estrov Z', 'Estey E', 'Troutman-Worden K', 'Gutterman JU', 'Talpaz M']","['Department of Clinical Immunology and Biological Therapy, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",IM,"['Blotting, Northern', '*Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*genetics']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1993 Jan;21(1):80-5.,,,,,,,,,,

Depletion of pre-existing TIMP-1 from fetal calf serum in culture medium using monoclonal antibody suppressed erythropoietin-induced differentiation as measured by the induction of hemoglobin, commitment assay and globin mRNAs. The removal of TIMP-1 also suppressed the proliferation of ELM-I-1-3 as measured by cell number and de novo DNA synthesis. These changes were reversed by the addition of purified TIMP-1 to the culture medium. Anti-TIMP-1 antibody also blocked both hexamethylene bisacetamide (HMBA)-induced erythroid differentiation and the proliferation of both ELM-I-1-3 and Friend erythroleukemia cells. Considering previous reports analyzing the chemical induction of Friend mouse erythroleukemia cell differentiation, our results suggest that erythropoietin- or HMBA-induced erythroid differentiation might also be coupled with cell proliferation. Our 3H thymidine-uptake experiment shows that TIMP-1 removal was also effective in the inhibition of cell growth of various other cell lines in addition to erythroleukemia cell lines. These results suggest that EPA action of TIMP-1 on erythroid leukemia cell lines is closely related to its activity to promote the cell growth of various cell lines and cells including erythroleukemia cell lines.","['Murate, T', 'Yamashita, K', 'Ohashi, H', 'Kagami, Y', 'Tsushita, K', 'Kinoshita, T', 'Hotta, T', 'Saito, H', 'Yoshida, S', 'Mori, K J']","['Murate T', 'Yamashita K', 'Ohashi H', 'Kagami Y', 'Tsushita K', 'Kinoshita T', 'Hotta T', 'Saito H', 'Yoshida S', 'Mori KJ', 'et al.']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Nagoya University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Acetamides)', '0 (Antibodies)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinases)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', 'LA133J59VU (hexamethylene bisacetamide)']",IM,"['Acetamides/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antibodies', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/*pathology', 'Erythropoietin/*pharmacology', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Gene Expression', 'Globins/genetics', 'Glycoproteins/immunology/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinases', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1993 Jan;21(1):169-76.,,,,,,,,,,

Methylprednisolone did not significantly alter the amount of sulfated glycosaminoglycans produced but the amount of the nonsulfated glycosaminoglycan, hyaluronic acid (HA), was dramatically decreased by the steroid. Culturing methylprednisolone-treated stroma with exogenous HA reduced the proportion of sulfated glycosaminoglycans incorporated into the cell layer and increased the proportion secreted into the medium. It also reduced the capacity of the stroma to bind and stimulate blast colony-forming cells. In fetal liver stroma, methylprednisolone did not decrease the amount of HA or alter the type of heparan sulfate produced. Thus, the ability of stroma cells to respond to steroid and the amount of HA in the extracellular matrix may vary in different marrow microenvironments.

Thirty-eight patients were studied by means of dot blot and Western blot techniques for cyclin A RNA and protein accumulation, and 21 were also studied for cell cycle distribution by using flow cytometric analysis. Semiquantitative studies were based on densitometric computerized evaluation of dot and Western blots. There was a very strong positive correlation between cyclin A RNA and protein expression (r = 0.99; P < 0.00005), indicating that cyclin A accumulation is regulated in these cells at a transcriptional level. There was also a highly significant positive correlation between cyclin A RNA expression and the cumulative percentage of cells in S plus G2-M phase (r = 0.98; P < 0.00005). Therefore, this in vivo study shows that the expression of cyclin A RNA and protein in human hematological malignancies correlates with the percentage of cells in S plus G2-M phase and identifies cyclin A as a new potential cell proliferation index in oncology.","['Paterlini, P', 'Suberville, A M', 'Zindy, F', 'Melle, J', 'Sonnier, M', 'Marie, J P', 'Dreyfus, F', 'Brechot, C']","['Paterlini P', 'Suberville AM', 'Zindy F', 'Melle J', 'Sonnier M', 'Marie JP', 'Dreyfus F', 'Brechot C']","['U370, CHU Necker, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Cyclins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Cell Cycle', '*Cell Division', 'Cyclins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/diagnosis/*pathology', 'Lymphoma/diagnosis/*pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics']",1993/01/15 00:00,1993/01/15 00:01,['1993/01/15 00:00'],"['1993/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1993 Jan 15;53(2):235-8.,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we generated three new IgG1-kappa monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs), termed SN8, SN8a and SN8b, by use of an unconventional approach, ie, by using an isolated B PLL antigen preparation to immunize mice. These MoAbs, particularly SN8, showed a highly selective reactivity to B PLL and B non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) among various human leukemia-lymphoma specimens tested; eg, SN8 was capable of effectively distinguishing B PLL from B CLL as well as from hairy cell leukemia (HCL) cell specimens. The cell surface antigen defined by the three MoAbs was determined to be a covalently linked heterodimeric glycoprotein complex (gp49/40) consisting of a 49,000 dalton (alpha-chain) and a 40,000-dalton component (beta-chain). Epitope comparison showed that the epitope defined by SN8 (SN8 epitope) is in close proximity to SN8a epitope but in a distant position from SN8b epitope. Western blot analysis showed that both SN8 and SN8a epitopes are on the beta-chain, but SN8b epitope was not detected on either the alpha- or the beta-chain of the reduced antigen in the same analysis. Binding of either SN8 or SN8b to the cell surface gp49/40 did not cause significant downregulation of the antigen expression whereas binding of SN8a to the antigen caused small (approximately 20%) decrease in the antigen expression. Among the various normal peripheral blood cells, only a subpopulation (6.0% to 24.2% among different specimens derived from different donors) of B cells reacted with the SN8 series MoAbs; these MoAbs showed no significant reactivity against T cells, granulocytes, monocytes, erythrocytes, and platelets. Minimal or no significant reactivity (0 to 2.6% among different specimens) was detected against normal bone marrow cells. Ricin A-chain conjugates of the three MoAbs are all strongly effective for specific killing of SN8 antigen-expressing leukemia cells in the absence of any potentiators; furthermore, the addition of 10 mmol/L NH4Cl, a potentiator, enhanced strongly the cytotoxic activities of the SN8, SN8a, and SN8b conjugates. Thus, each of the three MoAbs was effectively internalized after binding to the cell surface antigen.","['Okazaki, M', 'Luo, Y', 'Han, T', 'Yoshida, M', 'Seon, B K']","['Okazaki M', 'Luo Y', 'Han T', 'Yoshida M', 'Seon BK']","['Department of Molecular Immunology, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, NY 14263.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology/*metabolism', 'Antibody Affinity', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*analysis/immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Blotting, Western', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Humans', 'Hybridomas/immunology', 'Immunosorbent Techniques', 'Leukemia/immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/immunology', 'Leukemia, Prolymphocytic/diagnosis/*immunology', 'Lymphoma/immunology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/diagnosis/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)73299-4 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1993 Jan 1;81(1):84-94.,,,,,,,,['CA19304/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,

To study the possible relation of MC with relapse, we purified different populations of leukocytes and analyzed their donor/recipient origin by a method based on polymerase chain reaction amplification of minisatellite DNA regions. Our results show that before relapse, all hematopoietic recipient cells are T cells, whereas monocytes, B, and natural killer (NK) cells are of donor origin. This observation does not appear to be specific for CML as similar results were found in two control patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). At the time of (CML) relapse, recipient granulocytes, monocytes, and erythrocytes appeared and progressively replaced the respective lineages of donor origin. No other lineages seemed to be involved as B cells and NK cells remained of donor origin and no significant changes in the number of recipient T cells were detected. In this respect relapse of CML after BM transplantation (BMT) seems not to be very different from the primary disease in chronic phase before transplantation.

Because many chemotherapeutic drugs are capable of initiating pathways leading to apoptosis, we determined whether deregulated bcl-2 expression could render cells resistant to several drugs commonly used in the treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, including dexamethasone (DEX), methotrexate (MTX), 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosyl-cytosine (Ara-C), etoposide (VP-16), vincristine (VC), cisplatin (CP), and hydroperoxycyclophosphamide (4-HC). For these experiments, we achieved high levels of p26-Bcl-2 protein production in a human pre-B-cell leukemia line 697 by stable infection with a recombinant bcl-2-containing retrovirus and then compared these cells with control virus-infected 697 cells. Control 697 cells were induced to undergo apoptosis by all drugs tested as defined by DNA degradation into oligonucleosomal-length fragments, cell shrinkage, and subsequent cell death. In contrast, 697 cells with elevated Bcl-2 protein levels exhibited strikingly prolonged cell survival and markedly reduced DNA fragmentation when cultured in the presence of these antineoplastic agents. Although high levels of Bcl-2 protein protected 697 cells from the acute cytotoxic effects of DEX and the other drugs tested, Bcl-2 did not prevent these drugs from suppressing the proliferation of 697 cells. However, when 697 cells were treated with DEX or MTX for 3 days, then washed and cultured in semisolid media without drugs, bcl-2-virus-infected cells gave rise to colonies at much higher frequencies than 697 cells stably infected with control virus. These results indicate that by protecting 697 leukemic cells from the acute cytotoxicity of DEX and some other chemotherapeutic drugs, high levels of p26-Bcl-2 can create the opportunity for re-initiation of cell growth when drugs are withdrawn. The findings may be relevant to clinical correlative studies of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma patients that have found an association between worse prognosis and bcl-2 gene rearrangements or t[14;18] translocations.","['Miyashita, T', 'Reed, J C']","['Miyashita T', 'Reed JC']","['La Jolla Cancer Research Foundation, Cancer Research Institute, CA 92037.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Survival', 'DNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Methotrexate/pharmacology', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)73307-0 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1993 Jan 1;81(1):151-7.,,,,,,,,['CA-47956/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,

We have previously demonstrated that the expression of this growth-regulated gene could be trans activated by the 40-kDa Tax protein of HTLV-I (human T-cell leukemia virus type I) and that responsiveness to this viral protein was mediated by the presence of an NF-kappa B binding site located between -241 and -210 bp upstream of the mRNA cap site (A. Lilienbaum, M. Duc Dodon, C. Alexandre, L. Gazzolo, and D. Paulin, J. Virol. 64:256-263, 1990). These previous assays, performed with deletion mutants of the vimentin promoter linked to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene, also revealed the presence of an upstream negative region between -529 and -241 bp. Interestingly, the inhibitory activity exerted by this negative region was overcome after cotransfection of a Tax-expressing plasmid. In this study, we further characterize the vimentin negative element and define the effect of the Tax protein on the inhibitory activity of this element. We first demonstrate that a 187-bp domain (-424 to -237 bp) behaves as a negative region when placed upstream either of the NF-kappa B binding site of vimentin or of a heterologous enhancer such as that present in the desmin gene promoter. The negative effect can be further assigned to a 32-bp element which is indeed shown to repress the basal or induced activity of the NF-kappa B binding site.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Salvetti, A', 'Lilienbaum, A', 'Li, Z', 'Paulin, D', 'Gazzolo, L']","['Salvetti A', 'Lilienbaum A', 'Li Z', 'Paulin D', 'Gazzolo L']","['UMR30 Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique/Universite Claude Bernard Lyon I, Faculte de Medecine A.

While the transfected cells grew normally in the presence of mutant p53 (37.5 degrees C), wild-type p53 (32.5 degrees C) was associated with a rapid loss of cell viability. Genomic DNA extracted at 32.5 degrees C was seen to be fragmented into a characteristic ladder consistent with cell death due to apoptosis. Following synchronization by density arrest, transfected cells released into G1 at 32.5 degrees C were found to lose viability more rapidly than did randomly growing cultures. Following release into G1, cells became irreversibly committed to cell death after 4 h at 32.5 degrees C. Commitment to cell death correlated with the first appearance of fragmented DNA. Synchronized cells allowed to pass out of G1 prior to being placed at 32.5 degrees C continued to cycle until subsequently arrested in G1; loss of viability occurred following G1 arrest. In contrast to cells in G1, cells cultured at 32.5 degrees C for prolonged periods during S phase and G2/M, and then returned to 37.5 degrees C, did not become committed to cell death. G1 arrest at 37.5 degrees C, utilizing either mimosine or isoleucine deprivation, does not lead to rapid cell death. Upon transfer to 32.5 degrees C, these G1 synchronized cell populations quickly lost viability. Cells that were kept density arrested at 32.5 degrees C (G0) lost viability at a much slower rate than did cells released into G1. Taken together, these results indicate that wild-type p53 induces cell death in murine erythroleukemia cells and that this effect occurs predominantly in the G1 phase of actively cycling cells.","['Ryan, J J', 'Danish, R', 'Gottlieb, C A', 'Clarke, M F']","['Ryan JJ', 'Danish R', 'Gottlieb CA', 'Clarke MF']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan Medical Center, Ann Arbor 48109-0668.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,['0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)'],IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Cycle', '*Cell Death', 'Cell Differentiation', 'DNA Damage', '*Genes, p53', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Mice', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*physiology']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/mcb.13.1.711-719.1993 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1993 Jan;13(1):711-9. doi: 10.1128/mcb.13.1.711-719.1993.,,,,,PMC358949,,,['CA-46657/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,

The inclusion of an additional 459-bp 5' segment to this construct did not affect promoter activity. However, a deletion of 222 5' nucleotides from the same construct dramatically decreased promoter activity. In vivo genomic footprinting localized several protein-DNA interactions to the stretch of DNA shown to have transcriptional activity.

Transient transfection assays performed with -267 bp constructs containing mutations at each of the localized cis-acting elements revealed that the CRE, E box, and Ets elements work together in driving promoter activity and that the CRE and Ets elements are the most important for driving transcription.

Its gene is highly activated during postnatal development at stages containing many proliferating but also differentiating cells. In this report, a study on ProT alpha gene expression during differentiation of human myeloid leukemic (HL-60) cells was undertaken to analyze the possible association of ProT alpha to cell differentiation. When HL-60 cells were induced to differentiate to granulocytes (using retinoic acid) or monocyte/macrophages (using 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate), a marked down-regulation in the levels of ProT alpha transcript was found. When cell division of immature HL-60 cells was interrupted by either treatment with hydroxyurea or serum starvation, ProT alpha gene expression was not significantly altered. These findings suggest that loss of ProT alpha mRNA in induced HL-60 cells is a differentiation-related event. Examination of the stability of ProT alpha mRNA showed that the stabilization of the ProT alpha transcript is differentially regulated in the two HL-60 lineages. Nuclear run-on experiments revealed that during HL-60 differentiation, the transcriptional activity of the ProT alpha gene does not experience significant variations.","['Dosil, M', 'Alvarez-Fernandez, L', 'Gomez-Marquez, J']","['Dosil M', 'Alvarez-Fernandez L', 'Gomez-Marquez J']","['Departamento de Bioquimica e Biologia Molecular, Facultad de Biologia, Universidad de Santiago, Santiago de Compostela, Galicia, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (Protein Precursors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (prothymosin alpha)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '61512-21-8 (Thymosin)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects/*genetics', 'Down-Regulation', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Protein Precursors/*genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Thymosin/*analogs & derivatives/genetics/metabolism', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Up-Regulation']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0014-4827(83)71013-X [pii]', '10.1006/excr.1993.1013 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 1993 Jan;204(1):94-101. doi: 10.1006/excr.1993.1013.,,,,,,,,,,

The ALL generally follows the recovery of normal blood counts and most commonly occurs within 6 months of the onset of aplasia. The case of a patient with severe aplastic anemia is reported in whom ALL developed 15 months after the initial diagnosis of aplastic anemia. A literature search found 23 cases of ALL after a period of aplasia or hypoplasia. This patient's disease, however, was different from all previously reported ones. The severe aplasia lasted 15 months before being followed by ALL. There was no recovery of blood counts before the onset of ALL. METHODS: A review of the literature found 23 case reports in which aplasia or hypoplasia preceded ALL; these patients also had pancytopenia of the peripheral blood. Excluded from this review were patients whose bone marrow was hypoplastic, but who did not have pancytopenia because these did not have ""aplastic anemia"" as their initial disease. RESULTS: Analysis of the reported patients showed that most were girls 10 years of age or younger. There was an overwhelming prevalence of fever, which in several instances, might have had an infectious cause. ALL most commonly occurred within 6 months of the aplasia and usually followed the recovery of normal blood counts. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with ALL after a prolonged period of aplasia have several common characteristics including female sex, young age, and the prevalence of fever, often associated with an infectious illness. ALL usually follows the recovery of blood counts and occurs within 6 months of the onset of aplasia. The pathophysiology of this patient's disease(s) is still unclear. He could have had two unrelated disorders or a two-step leukemic process that followed a stem cell ""insult."" This patient had an antecedent hepatitis A infection 3 months before aplasia occurred. However, the authors were unable to identify with certainty any other event that might have caused additional bone marrow injury.","['Matloub, Y H', 'Brunning, R D', 'Arthur, D C', 'Ramsay, N K']","['Matloub YH', 'Brunning RD', 'Arthur DC', 'Ramsay NK']","['Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Anemia, Aplastic/drug therapy/genetics/*pathology', 'Biopsy', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Child, Preschool', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Male', 'Precancerous Conditions/drug therapy/genetics/*pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/genetics/*pathology']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19930101)71:1<264::aid-cncr2820710140>3.0.co;2-8 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1993 Jan 1;71(1):264-8. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19930101)71:1<264::aid-cncr2820710140>3.0.co;2-8.,36,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A 48-year-old woman with human T-lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I) antibody titer had multiple focal brain symptoms and skin eruptions without lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, or increased abnormal lymphocytes in the peripheral blood. No spastic paraparesis of the lower limbs was found. The encephalopathy was progressive, and she died 5 months later despite repeated intrathecal administration of methotrexate, cytosine arabinoside, and prednisolone and monthly systemic chemotherapy with doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisolone. RESULTS: Postmortem examinations identified unusual ATLL lesions composed of marked infiltrations of atypical mononuclear cells and bizarre MNGC with histiocytic granulomatous reactions in the leptomeninges, brain tissues along the Virchow-Robin spaces, skin, and kidney. Immunohistochemical stains confirmed the T-cell nature of such mononuclear cells and partially T-cell and partially macrophage nature of the MNGC, although no evidence of HTLV-I expression was found. CONCLUSIONS: ATLL presenting with CNS symptoms is rare. It was assumed that the direct cytopathic effects of HTLV-I were responsible for the formation of the MNGC after considering the similarity with MNGC in encephalopathy caused by the human immunodeficiency virus.","['Taguchi, H', 'Sonobe, H', 'Yamato, K', 'Takeuchi, T', 'Ookawa, K', 'Kodama, H', 'Ohtsuki, Y', 'Miyoshi, I']","['Taguchi H', 'Sonobe H', 'Yamato K', 'Takeuchi T', 'Ookawa K', 'Kodama H', 'Ohtsuki Y', 'Miyoshi I']","['Department of Medicine, Kochi Medical School, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Brain/*pathology', 'Brain Diseases/etiology/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Kidney/*pathology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*pathology', 'Leukemic Infiltration', 'Middle Aged', 'Skin/*pathology']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19930101)71:1<133::aid-cncr2820710121>3.0.co;2-g [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1993 Jan 1;71(1):133-7. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19930101)71:1<133::aid-cncr2820710121>3.0.co;2-g.,,,,,,,,,,

A morphologic and immunohistochemical study of 11 cases.,124-32,"BACKGROUND: Monocytic differentiation is present in the myelomonocytic (M4) and monocytic (M5) type of acute myeloblastic leukemia. Infiltration of the skin in acute myelomonocytic leukemia occurs in 10-20% of patients, the skin lesions occasionally being the first symptom, even preceding monocytosis. METHODS: Eleven patients with myelomonocytic (n = 2) and monocytic leukemia (n = 9) were studied who had skin manifestations. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Clinically, all patients showed disseminated papules or nodules that corresponded histologically to nodular or diffuse infiltrates of monocytoid cells, occasionally displaying a whorled pattern. The currently available antibodies for paraffin-embedded sections (lysozyme, elastase, leukocyte common antigen (CD45), MT1 (CD43), Leu-M1 (CD15), LN2 (CD74), MB2, MB1 (CD45RA), LN1 (w75), Mac387, L26 (CD20), UCHL1 (CDR0), MT2 (CD45RA), and KP-1 (CD68)) and chloracetate-esterase are not more helpful in diagnosis than are the histologic findings.

METHODS: Case reports are presented for three patients with acute myeloid leukemia in whom leukemic infiltration of the esophageal mucosa was diagnosed histologically and cytologically by endoscopic examination. Autopsies of patients with leukemia from 1976-1988 were reviewed. RESULTS: The autopsy review of 207 patients with leukemia showed evidence of leukemic infiltration in the esophagus in 7.2% of cases. The only clinical factor identified to be significantly associated with esophageal involvement by leukemic cells was a high initial leukocyte count. Esophageal involvement was associated with leukemic infiltration of other soft tissues and organs. CONCLUSIONS: Although the etiology of dysphagia in patients with acute leukemia is usually related to infection, reflux, chemotherapy toxicity, or benign strictures, the frequency of esophageal leukemic infiltration in this autopsy series suggests that this diagnosis must be considered.

Transfection of the murine cell line NIH 3T3 with expression vectors containing the wild-type or mutated env region did not result in syncytium formation. Immunoprecipitation analysis of the envelope glycoproteins expressed in NIH 3T3 and XC cells showed that the mature surface glycoprotein expressed in XC cells was of a much lower apparent molecular weight than that expressed in NIH 3T3 cells. Further characterization showed that most if not all of this difference was the result of differences in glycosylation.

However, none of the established erythroleukemia cell lines has allowed B19 virus replication in vitro. The remarkable erythroid tissue tropism of B19 virus was evaluated with a human megakaryocytic leukemia cell line, MB-02, which is dependent on the growth factor granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor but can be induced to undergo erythroid differentiation following treatment with erythropoietin (Epo). Whereas these cells did not support B19 virus DNA replication in the presence of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor alone, active viral DNA replication was observed if the cells were exposed to Epo for 5 to 10 days prior to B19 virus infection, as detected by the presence of the characteristic B19 virus DNA replicative intermediates on Southern blots. No replication occurred if the cells were treated with Epo for 3 days or less. In addition, complete expression of the B19 virus genome also occurred in Epo-treated MB-02 cells, as detected by Northern blot analysis. B19 progeny virions were released into culture supernatants that were biologically active in secondary infection of normal human bone marrow cells. The availability of the only homogeneous permanent cell line in which induction of erythroid differentiation leads to a permissive state for B19 virus replication in vitro promises to yield new and useful information on the molecular basis of the erythroid tissue tropism as well as parvovirus B19-induced pathogenesis.","['Munshi, N C', 'Zhou, S', 'Woody, M J', 'Morgan, D A', 'Srivastava, A']","['Munshi NC', 'Zhou S', 'Woody MJ', 'Morgan DA', 'Srivastava A']","['Department of Medicine, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis 46202-5120.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Replication', 'DNA, Viral', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/*microbiology/pathology', 'Genome, Viral', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/*microbiology', 'Parvovirus B19, Human/*growth & development', 'Virion']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.67.1.562-566.1993 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1993 Jan;67(1):562-6. doi: 10.1128/JVI.67.1.562-566.1993.,,,,,PMC237395,,,"['AI-26323/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-48342/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,

This cell-free translation resulted in two major translation products representing the Gag and Gag-Pro polyproteins. By contrast, the Gag-Pro-Pol polyprotein could be readily observed only when translation was performed with mutant mRNA in which the protease (pro) reading frame was aligned to gag to eliminate the frameshifting event in the gag-pro overlap. The results indicated that two independent ribosomal frameshifting events are required for expression of the HTLV-I pol gene product. Studies with mutant DNAs facilitated the characterization of the primary structure of the HTLV-I mRNA responsible for the ribosomal frameshift in the pro-pol overlap and demonstrated that the frameshift occurs at the signal sequence UUUAAAC.

From November 1987 to April 1989, a total of 32 patients with NHL were recruited; 6 were infants with Burkitt's lymphoma and 26 were adults with NHL. Each patient was matched with 2 asymptomatic controls for age, sex and ethnic group. HTLV-I serology was done by ELISA and Western blot. Comparison of the groups was done by chi-square analysis. None of the 6 infants with Burkitt's lymphoma and none of their controls had antibodies to HTLV-I. Of the 26 patients with NHL, 7 (26.9%) had HTLV-I antibodies. Among the 52 controls, the HTLV-I rate was 13.4% (n = 7). There was no difference between cases and controls (Fisher's exact test, p = 0.16). Among the 26 NHL, 4 cases fitted the criteria of ATLL and were HTLV-I-positive; 3 others who were positive for HTLV-I were a woman with lymphoblastic gastric NHL and 2 old men with an unclassified lymphoma. From the results of this limited series it is not possible to state that there is an association between NHL and HTLV-I infection. Nevertheless, cases of ATLL related to HTLV-I are reported from this area. Based on the HTLV-I seroprevalence rates reported in Gabon, the estimated incidence rate of ATL among seropositive people in Gabon appears much lower than in Japan. Different explanations can be proposed, but under-diagnosis of ATLL is probably one of the main factors.","['Delaporte, E', 'Klotz, F', 'Peeters, M', 'Martin-Prevel, Y', 'Bedjabaga, L', 'Larouze, B', 'Nguembi-Mbina, C', 'Walter, P', 'Piot, P']","['Delaporte E', 'Klotz F', 'Peeters M', 'Martin-Prevel Y', 'Bedjabaga L', 'Larouze B', 'Nguembi-Mbina C', 'Walter P', 'Piot P']","['INSERM U13/IMEA, Hopital Claude Bernard, Paris, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,['0 (HTLV-I Antibodies)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/epidemiology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Female', 'Gabon/epidemiology', 'HTLV-I Antibodies/*analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*epidemiology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prevalence']",1993/01/02 00:00,1993/01/02 00:01,['1993/01/02 00:00'],"['1993/01/02 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/02 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/02 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.2910530110 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1993 Jan 2;53(1):48-50. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910530110.,,,,,,,,,,

Apoptotic death is induced selectively by ET-18-OMe in HL60 cells, which are sensitive to the drug's cytotoxic action, but not in the resistant K562 cell line. Enrichment of HL60 cells with cholesterol (HL60-CHOL cells) significantly protects the cells from the cytotoxic effect and from the induction of apoptosis by ET-18-OMe; the percentage of fragmented DNA is only 17% for HL60-CHOL, compared with 50% in native HL60 cells after exposure to 20 microns ET-18-OMe for 24 hr.

The PML-RAR alpha chimera cooperates with c-Jun and, strikingly, with c-Fos to stimulate the transcription of both synthetic and natural reporter genes containing an AP-1 site. Stimulation is dependent on the concentration of RA and its dose-response curve is comparable to that for activation by RAR alpha of transcription on RA-responsive genes. Further, in the absence of RA, a circumstance in which RAR alpha has no effect on AP-1 activity, PML-RAR alpha is an inhibitor. Deletion of the dimerization, transactivation, or DNA-binding domains of c-Jun and removal of the PML dimerization domain in the PML-RAR alpha hybrid abrogates their transcriptional cooperatively. In view of the association between AP-1 activity and hemopoietic differentiation, we suggest that these properties of PML-RAR alpha could contribute to the leukemic phenotype and its response to RA.","['Doucas, V', 'Brockes, J P', 'Yaniv, M', 'de The, H', 'Dejean, A']","['Doucas V', 'Brockes JP', 'Yaniv M', 'de The H', 'Dejean A']","['Departement des Biotechnologies, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (Collagenases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Collagenases/genetics', 'Genes', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', '*Neoplasm Proteins', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun/*physiology', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/*chemistry/genetics', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/physiology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Transcription Factors/*chemistry/genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Tretinoin/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",1993/10/15 00:00,1993/10/15 00:01,['1993/10/15 00:00'],"['1993/10/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/10/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/10/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.90.20.9345 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1993 Oct 15;90(20):9345-9. doi: 10.1073/pnas.90.20.9345.,,,,,PMC47564,,,,,

All breakpoints cloned in this area have been mapped to 14q32.1, an area distant approximately 10,000 kb from the immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene locus on chromosome 14q band 32.3. Except for two cases of inversion, no physical linkage of the cloned breakpoints has been reported, nor has a gene been identified in this region. Taking advantage of chromosome-walking techniques and of the P1 phage, we cloned and characterized 450 kb of the germ-line TCL1 locus, starting from the breakpoints of two independent T-cell leukemias. We show that all molecular rearrangements characterized so far map to these clones, indicating not only that this region is the target of chromosomal rearrangements occurring in this area but also that both inversion and translocations occur within a 300-kb region in the T-cell leukemias. In the attempt to identify a candidate oncogene responsible for the malignant transformation, a CpG island centromeric to the inversions and to the translocations has been identified. Two probes near the CpG island have detected sequences conserved among species, as well as two transcripts in the K562 human erythroleukemia cell line. On the basis of these data, a model of activation of the putative TCL1 oncogene is suggested.","['Virgilio, L', 'Isobe, M', 'Narducci, M G', 'Carotenuto, P', 'Camerini, B', 'Kurosawa, N', 'Abbas-ar-Rushdi', 'Croce, C M', 'Russo, G']","['Virgilio L', 'Isobe M', 'Narducci MG', 'Carotenuto P', 'Camerini B', 'Kurosawa N', 'Abbas-ar-Rushdi', 'Croce CM', 'Russo G']","['Raggio-Italgene, Pomezia, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Chromosome Aberrations/*genetics', 'Chromosome Disorders', 'Chromosome Mapping', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA Primers/chemistry', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'Genes', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/genetics', 'Restriction Mapping', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1993/10/15 00:00,1993/10/15 00:01,['1993/10/15 00:00'],"['1993/10/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/10/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/10/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.90.20.9275 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1993 Oct 15;90(20):9275-9. doi: 10.1073/pnas.90.20.9275.,,,"['TCL1', 'TCRA']",,PMC47550,,,,,

Analysis of response to immunomodulators confirmed the existence, in patients with idiopathic chronic pure red cell aplasia, of a relationship between in vitro behaviour and obtention of a remission: patients with normal differentiation of erythroblasts consistently responded to treatments, whereas treatments were usually ineffective when the erythroblasts did not differentiate in vitro. When in vitro differentiation was below normal, responses to treatments were varied. In patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, the erythroblastic precursors were normal in 15/18 cases, and response to immunomodulators was observed in 13/18 cases.

The use of yeast artificial chromosomes (YACs) containing long stretches of human DNA allows dispersed DNA markers to be used to identify the position of breakpoints but does not readily allow subcloning of the precise breakpoint within the YAC DNA nor the cDNAs containing the affected genes. We describe a procedure allowing rapid isolation of cDNAs corresponding to genes within a YAC clone. Random cDNA is hybridised to PCR-generated biotinylated fragments of total DNA from a yeast strain harbouring a YAC clone.

To directly examine the role of this putative oncogene, an SCL retrovirus was constructed and used to infect a v-ABL transformed T-lymphocyte cell line. Thirteen independent SCL-infected and four control cell lines were established and injected subcutaneously into syngeneic mice. Mice injected with SCL-infected clonal cell lines died significantly more rapidly than control animals. By day 200 46% (40/87) of animals injected with SCL-infected cell lines had died due to disseminated transplantable lymphoid tumours. In contrast only 22% of control mice were dead by day 200 (P < 0.0015). Of possible relevance to the enhanced tumourigenesis, some SCL-infected cell lines displayed increased clonogenicity in agar. Increased cell growth was even more striking when ex-vivo tumour-derived cell lines were studied. Thus, SCL can co-operate with v-ABL to hasten T-cell tumourigenesis. This is the first direct evidence demonstrating that SCL can behave as an oncogene.","['Elwood, N J', 'Cook, W D', 'Metcalf, D', 'Begley, C G']","['Elwood NJ', 'Cook WD', 'Metcalf D', 'Begley CG']","['Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Royal Melbourne Hospital, Parkville, Victoria, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Tal1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '135471-20-4 (TAL1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors', 'Cell Line, Transformed', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Genes, abl', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*etiology', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'T-Lymphocytes/microbiology', '*Transcription Factors']",1993/11/01 00:00,1993/11/01 00:01,['1993/11/01 00:00'],"['1993/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncogene. 1993 Nov;8(11):3093-101.,,,['SCL'],,,,,,,

In the present study, we isolated chimeric cDNAs between the MLL and a gene designated MLLT3 at 9p22 from a cDNA library of an IMS-M1 cell line with a t(9;11)(p22;q23) translocation, a representative karyotypic abnormality seen in acute monocytic leukemia. We also isolated a normal MLLT3 cDNA and found an open reading frame encoding at least 318 amino acids with high serine/proline content (24.8%). The chimeric mRNAs were demonstrated to be fused to MLL in frame, as found in t(11;19) and t(4;11) leukemias. The predicted MLLT3 protein demonstrated a significant homology to that of the MLLT1 gene at 19p13 involved in t(11;19) leukemia. The highest homology, up to 74.1%, was found in 86 amino acids of the C-terminus, suggesting that this region is of particular importance for leukemogenesis in t(9;11) leukemia. Northern blot analysis with the MLLT3 cDNA probe against normal tissues revealed multiple transcripts in lymphoid organs. A survey of hematopoietic cell lines demonstrated relatively stronger signals in cells belonging to megakaryocytic and erythroid lineages. As previously found in t(11;19) leukemia, heterogeneous MLL-MLLT3 chimeric mRNAs could be detected by the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in t(9;11) leukemia samples.","['Iida, S', 'Seto, M', 'Yamamoto, K', 'Komatsu, H', 'Tojo, A', 'Asano, S', 'Kamada, N', 'Ariyoshi, Y', 'Takahashi, T', 'Ueda, R']","['Iida S', 'Seto M', 'Yamamoto K', 'Komatsu H', 'Tojo A', 'Asano S', 'Kamada N', 'Ariyoshi Y', 'Takahashi T', 'Ueda R']","['Laboratory of Chemotherapy, Aichi Cancer Center Research Institute, Nagoya, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (MLLT1 protein, human)', '0 (MLLT3 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '452VLY9402 (Serine)', '9DLQ4CIU6V (Proline)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 19', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9', 'DNA, Complementary/chemistry/isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/chemistry/*genetics', '*Nuclear Proteins', '*Oncogenes', 'Proline/analysis', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Serine/analysis', '*Transcription Factors', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1993/11/01 00:00,1993/11/01 00:01,['1993/11/01 00:00'],"['1993/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncogene. 1993 Nov;8(11):3085-92.,,,"['MLLT1', 'MLLT3']",,,,,,['GENBANK/D16688'],

The four previously identified domains which make up the extracellular ligand binding region of the receptor are coded for by two copies of a 300 amino acid repeat. We have demonstrated that the 3' end of each repeat coincides with the 3' end of the last exon making up the repeat. This alignment suggests that an exon-duplication may have occurred in the ligand-binding region of the gene. The transmembrane domain is encoded within a single exon and the exon boundaries of the catalytic domain closely match those defined by structural homology with other kinases. Along with the 54 chicken splice sites, the region 5' to the first exon was also sequenced. The proposed promoter region is greater than 70% GC, contains five repeats of the consensus Sp1 binding sequence and does not have a CCATT or TATA box. In addition to the presence of these characteristic housekeeping features, expression analysis confirms the promoter activity of this region and four sets of TCC repeats similar to those found in the human EGF-R promoter have been identified. To our knowledge this represents the first complete description of the exon-intron structure of the EGF-receptor family. The elucidation of the EGF-R exon structure provides insight into the domain evolution of the receptor-kinases and the mechanisms for the oncogenic conversion of EGF-R in erythroleukemias and glioblastomas.","['Callaghan, T', 'Antczak, M', 'Flickinger, T', 'Raines, M', 'Myers, M', 'Kung, H J']","['Callaghan T', 'Antczak M', 'Flickinger T', 'Raines M', 'Myers M', 'Kung HJ']","['Department of Molecular Biology and Microbiology, Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, Cleveland, Ohio 44106.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chick Embryo', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'ErbB Receptors/chemistry/*genetics', '*Exons', 'Glioblastoma/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Multigene Family', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/chemistry/*genetics']",1993/11/01 00:00,1993/11/01 00:01,['1993/11/01 00:00'],"['1993/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncogene. 1993 Nov;8(11):2939-48.,,,,,,,,"['NCI CA 39207/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P-30 CA43703/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,

FDC-P1 cells were infected with retroviral constructs containing the neo gene and either a wild-type or a temperature-sensitive v-src oncogene. v-srcwt abrogated the factor-dependency of these cells since each G418r colony gave rise to factor-independent cells and no autocrine growth factor activity was detected. Moreover, the vast majority (< 99%) of cells infected with the v-srcts mutant gave rise to conditional factor-independent cells. Therefore a functional v-src gene product was required for growth factor-independence which occurred by a non-autocrine mechanism. A minority of factor-independent cells which arose after v-srcts infection, grew at the non-permissive temperature and one-half secreted granulocyte/macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) which supports the growth of the parental cells. Since the v-srcts viral stock contained a helper virus, Murine Leukemia Virus (MuLV), the ability of this virus to relieve factor-dependency was examined. A low frequency of factor-independent transformants was recovered after MuLV infection and one-half secreted GM-CSF. Therefore, retroviruses such as MuLV which lack an oncogene, can transform cells by stimulating autocrine growth factor secretion. Subsequent experiments performed with helper-free v-src preparations indicated that they could abrogate factor-dependency directly by a non-autocrine mechanism. These results demonstrate that a hematopoietic cell line can be transformed by two different mechanisms after retroviral infection and may be relevant for understanding hematopoietic cell transformation after persistent viral infection.","['McCubrey, J A', 'Smith, S R', 'Algate, P A', 'DeVente, J E', 'White, M K', 'Steelman, L S']","['McCubrey JA', 'Smith SR', 'Algate PA', 'DeVente JE', 'White MK', 'Steelman LS']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, East Carolina University School of Medicine, Greenville, North Carolina 27858.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Growth Substances)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Oncogene Protein pp60(v-src))']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Transformed', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'DNA/biosynthesis', '*Genes, src', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/genetics/pharmacology', 'Growth Substances/*pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/microbiology', 'Mice', 'Oncogene Protein pp60(v-src)/physiology', 'Proviruses/genetics/isolation & purification/physiology', 'Retroviridae/*genetics/physiology', 'Temperature']",1993/11/01 00:00,1993/11/01 00:01,['1993/11/01 00:00'],"['1993/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncogene. 1993 Nov;8(11):2905-15.,,,['v-src'],,,,,['NCI RO1CA51025/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,

Preliminary studies revealed that before undergoing bone marrow transplantation such patients differed in their burden of leukemic progenitor cells. These observations suggested that the burden of these cells might influence the risk of relapse after transplantation. METHODS: The number of residual leukemic progenitor cells before bone marrow transplantation was determined for 83 patients with high-risk ALL. We combined multiparameter flow cytometry and cell sorting with assays for leukemic progenitor cells in a quantitative method for the detection of minimal residual disease. RESULTS: The count of leukemic progenitor cells in bone marrow specimens from patients in remission varied markedly between patients, ranging from 0 to 12,546 cells per million mononuclear cells, or from 0 to 1.255 percent (median, 51 leukemic progenitor cells per million mononuclear cells, or 0.005 percent). Patients whose count of leukemic progenitor cells exceeded the median value had a higher likelihood of relapse than did patients with values below the median (relapse rate at one year, 100 percent vs. 41 percent; P < 0.001). There was a statistically significant inverse relation between the leukemic progenitor-cell content of bone marrow before transplantation and the duration of remission after transplantation (P < 0.001). The estimated risk of relapse for patients with > or = 51 leukemic progenitor cells per million mononuclear cells was more than 3.5 times the risk for patients with lower counts, after adjustment for the effects of other covariates (P = 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: The count of residual leukemic progenitor cells is a powerful predictor of relapse after autologous bone marrow transplantation, particularly among male patients. Its measurement may be useful for analyzing and improving the treatment of patients with high-risk ALL in remission.","['Uckun, F M', 'Kersey, J H', 'Haake, R', 'Weisdorf, D', 'Nesbit, M E', 'Ramsay, N K']","['Uckun FM', 'Kersey JH', 'Haake R', 'Weisdorf D', 'Nesbit ME', 'Ramsay NK']","['Bone Marrow Transplantation Program, University of Minnesota Health Sciences Center, Minneapolis.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,N Engl J Med,The New England journal of medicine,0255562,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cell Count', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*pathology/*therapy', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Regression Analysis', 'Remission Induction', 'Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",1993/10/28 00:00,1993/10/28 00:01,['1993/10/28 00:00'],"['1993/10/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/10/28 00:01 [medline]', '1993/10/28 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1056/NEJM199310283291802 [doi]'],ppublish,N Engl J Med. 1993 Oct 28;329(18):1296-301. doi: 10.1056/NEJM199310283291802.,,,,,,,,"['CA 21737/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 42111/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 42633/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,

METHODS: To assess long-term outcome in the series of clinical trials conducted at St. Jude Hospital, we compared the results of treatment typical of four eras: exploratory combination chemotherapy (era 1, 1962 to 1966; 91 patients), regimens for the control of meningeal leukemia (era 2, 1967 to 1979; 825 patients), limited intensification of therapy (era 3, 1979 to 1983; 428 patients), and extended intensification of therapy (era 4, 1984 to 1988; 358 patients). (""Intensification"" refers to strategies of systemic chemotherapy that are more aggressive than conventional ones.) The major end points were survival and event-free survival; we also calculated the relative risk of treatment failure and the rate of relapse or death after treatment ended (post-treatment failure rate). RESULTS: The probability of event-free survival improved significantly in each successive era (P < 0.001 by the log-rank test), reaching 71 percent in era 4. There was a decrease of approximately 50 percent in the risk of treatment failure from one era to the next in each subgroup of patients defined according to different combinations of the leukocyte count, race, age, and sex. Leukemia appeared to be eradicated in patients who remained in complete remission for three years or more after treatment in era 4. The incidence of death due to nonleukemic causes remained 4 to 6 percent despite the trend toward more intensive treatment. An estimated 765 patients (45 percent) are long-term survivors; most of them (80 percent) have no health problems related to leukemia or its treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The development and successful application of preventive therapy for meningeal leukemia, followed by the intensification of systemic chemotherapy, has progressively improved the rate of cure of childhood lymphoblastic leukemia, with relatively few adverse sequelae.","['Rivera, G K', 'Pinkel, D', 'Simone, J V', 'Hancock, M L', 'Crist, W M']","['Rivera GK', 'Pinkel D', 'Simone JV', 'Hancock ML', 'Crist WM']","[""Department of Hematology-Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,N Engl J Med,The New England journal of medicine,0255562,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Treatment Failure', 'Treatment Outcome']",1993/10/28 00:00,1993/10/28 00:01,['1993/10/28 00:00'],"['1993/10/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/10/28 00:01 [medline]', '1993/10/28 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1056/NEJM199310283291801 [doi]'],ppublish,N Engl J Med. 1993 Oct 28;329(18):1289-95. doi: 10.1056/NEJM199310283291801.,,,,['N Engl J Med. 1993 Oct 28;329(18):1343-4.

In a clinical trial, we tested the combination of cyclosporine and prednisone with and without methotrexate for the prevention of GVHD. METHODS: One hundred fifty patients with either acute leukemia in first complete remission, chronic myelogenous leukemia in first chronic phase, or lymphoblastic lymphoma in first complete remission were enrolled in the study. All the patients were given fractionated total-body irradiation (1320 cGy) and etoposide (60 mg per kilogram of body weight) in preparation for transplantation, and received bone marrow from genotypically histocompatible donors. To prevent GVHD, they were randomly assigned to prophylactic treatment with either cyclosporine, methotrexate, and prednisone or cyclosporine and prednisone without methotrexate. All the patients received standardized supportive care after transplantation, including intravenous gamma globulin. RESULTS: Patients receiving cyclosporine, methotrexate, and prednisone had a significantly lower incidence of acute GVHD of grades II to IV (9 percent) than those receiving cyclosporine and prednisone (23 percent, P = 0.02). Multivariate regression analysis demonstrated that an increased risk of acute GVHD was associated with an elevated serum creatinine concentration (P = 0.006) and treatment with cyclosporine and prednisone alone (P = 0.02). The lower incidence of acute GVHD was not associated with a higher rate of relapse of leukemia or lymphoma. There was no significant difference in disease-free survival at three years between the two treatment groups (64 percent with the three-drug regimen vs. 59 percent with the two-drug regimen, P = 0.57). CONCLUSIONS: The combination of cyclosporine, methotrexate, and prednisone was more effective in preventing acute GVHD of grades II to IV than was the combination of cyclosporine and prednisone without methotrexate.","['Chao, N J', 'Schmidt, G M', 'Niland, J C', 'Amylon, M D', 'Dagis, A C', 'Long, G D', 'Nademanee, A P', 'Negrin, R S', ""O'Donnell, M R"", 'Parker, P M']","['Chao NJ', 'Schmidt GM', 'Niland JC', 'Amylon MD', 'Dagis AC', 'Long GD', 'Nademanee AP', 'Negrin RS', ""O'Donnell MR"", 'Parker PM', 'et al.']","['Bone Marrow Transplantation Program, Stanford University, Calif.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,N Engl J Med,The New England journal of medicine,0255562,"['83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Chi-Square Distribution', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cyclosporine/therapeutic use', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/therapeutic use', 'Middle Aged', 'Prednisone/therapeutic use', 'Recurrence', 'Regression Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",1993/10/21 00:00,1993/10/21 00:01,['1993/10/21 00:00'],"['1993/10/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/10/21 00:01 [medline]', '1993/10/21 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1056/NEJM199310213291703 [doi]'],ppublish,N Engl J Med. 1993 Oct 21;329(17):1225-30. doi: 10.1056/NEJM199310213291703.,,,,,,,,"['CA-30206/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-49605/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,

Surprisingly, we observed ER down-regulation in a newly constructed E2-responsive cell line (Rat1 + ER), in which expression of the coding region of the ER cDNA was driven by the Moloney murine leukemia virus long terminal repeat. We present evidence that the coding region of the ER cDNA, but not the Moloney murine leukemia virus long terminal repeat, possesses a sequence(s) necessary for ER down-regulation. The observed down-regulation occurs at ligand-binding and protein, as well as mRNA, levels. Marked decreases in both protein and mRNA levels were observed as early as 3 h after E2 treatment. Furthermore, maximal down-regulation occurred by 18-24 h with ligand-binding, and mRNA levels reached approximately 20% that of controls. ER down-regulation in Rat1 + ER cells is only partially inhibited by the presence of cycloheximide and therefore suggests a direct participation of the ER in this process. E2 does not appear to influence the stability of the ER transcript, which implies that negative regulation is occurring at the transcriptional level. Finally, since we can demonstrate ER binding to a portion of the cDNA sequence, we propose a mechanism whereby ER binding to its putative negative element leads to transcriptional repression of the upstream promoter.","['Kaneko, K J', 'Furlow, J D', 'Gorski, J']","['Kaneko KJ', 'Furlow JD', 'Gorski J']","['Department of Biochemistry, University of Wisconsin, Madison 53706.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Endocrinol,"Molecular endocrinology (Baltimore, Md.)",8801431,"['0 (Estrogens)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Estrogen)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor))', 'EC 2.7.1.119 (hygromycin-B kinase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'DNA/analysis/*genetics', 'Dactinomycin/pharmacology', 'Down-Regulation/*genetics', 'Estrogens/pharmacology', 'Fibroblasts/chemistry/cytology/metabolism', 'Gene Expression/genetics', 'Ligands', 'Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor)/genetics', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Protein Binding', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis/genetics', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Estrogen/analysis/*genetics/physiology', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription, Genetic/genetics']",1993/07/01 00:00,1993/07/01 00:01,['1993/07/01 00:00'],"['1993/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1210/mend.7.7.8413312 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Endocrinol. 1993 Jul;7(7):879-88. doi: 10.1210/mend.7.7.8413312.,,,"['ER', 'HPT']",,,,,"['HD-07259/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'HD-08192/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States']",,

GATA-1 binding to the CAAT element was very unstable (half-life < 1 min), whereas bindings of a, b, and CP1 were comparatively stable, with half-lives of 18, 19, and 3.5 min, respectively. Stable transfections of MEL cells showed that in the presence of the beta-globin locus control region (LCR), the wild-type CAAT box, a mutant which bound to GATA-1 with increased stability over the normal sequences, and a mutant which bound a, b, and CP1 specifically could all stimulate transcription greater than ninefold over that induced by a null CAAT mutation in both uninduced and terminally differentiated MEL cells. A mutant which bound the a and b factors specifically gave only a twofold stimulation of promoter activity, and this lower activity correlated with a decrease in the stability of binding of the b protein. On the other hand, CP1 binding alone did not stimulate transcription. Taken together, these results suggest that in the context of the wild-type beta-globin CAAT element the b factor stimulates transcription directed by the LCR in MEL cells, although the LCR can also function through more stable GATA-1-binding sequences. However, in K562 cells, the wild-type beta-globin CAAT box alone was unable to stimulate gene expression directed by the LCR and high levels of transcription were obtained only upon inclusion of more upstream beta-globin promoter sequences. In contrast, a construct containing only the A gamma-globin CAAT box region did give high expression levels in K562 cells. Thus, there is a fundamental difference in the way the LCR functions in these two model systems in terms of its requirements at the promoter level.","['Delvoye, N L', 'Destroismaisons, N M', 'Wall, L A']","['Delvoye NL', 'Destroismaisons NM', 'Wall LA']","['Institut du Cancer de Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors)', '0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA1 protein, human)', '0 (Gata1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor', 'Gene Expression', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Globins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive', 'Methylation', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Zinc Fingers/physiology']",1993/11/01 00:00,1993/11/01 00:01,['1993/11/01 00:00'],"['1993/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/mcb.13.11.6969-6983.1993 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1993 Nov;13(11):6969-83. doi: 10.1128/mcb.13.11.6969-6983.1993.,,,,,PMC364758,,,,,

To understand the mechanisms underlying the cell-type-specific expression of this gene, we have characterized the regulatory functions and the DNA-protein interactions of the 5'-flanking region of the mouse perforin gene (Pfp). A region extending from residues +62 through -141, which possesses the essential promoter activity, and regions further upstream, which are able to either enhance or suppress gene expression, were identified. The region between residues -411 and -566 was chosen for further characterization, since it contains an enhancer-like activity. We have identified a 32-mer sequence (residues -491 to -522) which appeared to be capable of enhancing gene expression in a killer cell-specific manner. Within this segment, a 9-mer motif (5'-ACAGGAAGT-3', residues -505 to -497; designated NF-P motif), which is highly homologous to the Ets proto-oncoprotein-binding site, was found to interact with two proteins, NF-P1 and NF-P2. NF-P2 appears to be induced by reagents known to up-regulate the perforin message level and is present exclusively in killer cells. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay and UV cross-linking experiments revealed that NF-P1 and NF-P2 may possess common DNA-binding subunits. However, the larger native molecular mass of NF-P1 suggests that NF-P1 contains an additional non-DNA-binding subunit(s). In view of the homology between the NF-P motif and other Ets proto-oncoprotein-binding sites, it is postulated that NF-P1 and NF-P2 belong to the Ets protein family. Results obtained from the binding competition assay, nevertheless, suggest that NF-P1 and NF-P2 are related to but distinct from Ets proteins, e.g., Ets-1, Ets-2, and NF-AT/Elf-1, known to be expressed in T cells.","['Koizumi, H', 'Horta, M F', 'Youn, B S', 'Fu, K C', 'Kwon, B S', 'Young, J D', 'Liu, C C']","['Koizumi H', 'Horta MF', 'Youn BS', 'Fu KC', 'Kwon BS', 'Young JD', 'Liu CC']","['Laboratory of Molecular Immunology and Cell Biology, Rockefeller University, New York, New York 10021.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (ETS1 protein, human)', '0 (Ets1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Pore Forming Cytotoxic Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Protein c-ets-1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '126465-35-8 (Perforin)', 'EC 2.3.1.28 (Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line', 'Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Lymphokine-Activated/drug effects/physiology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/drug effects/immunology/*physiology', 'Leukemia, T-Cell', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mast-Cell Sarcoma', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Molecular Weight', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides', 'Perforin', 'Pore Forming Cytotoxic Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Protein c-ets-1', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', '*Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/drug effects/immunology/*physiology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Thymoma', 'Thymus Neoplasms', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/11/01 00:00,1993/11/01 00:01,['1993/11/01 00:00'],"['1993/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/mcb.13.11.6690-6701.1993 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1993 Nov;13(11):6690-701. doi: 10.1128/mcb.13.11.6690-6701.1993.,,,,,PMC364732,,,"['CA-47307/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R03-DE10525/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States']",,

This IUE element confers a CpG methylation-sensitive IUEB binding and enhancer activity. Using gel retardation, methylation interference, CpG methylation sensitivity binding, and cotransfection assays, we have now identified the 65-kDa IUEB as YY1 (also called NF-E1, delta, or UCRBP), a zinc finger protein related to the Kruppel family. YY1 binds to a number of similar but distinct DNA motifs, and cotransfection assays indicate that these motifs have different enhancer potentials in PYS-2 cells. The relative strengths of these elements are as follows: IUE > kappa E3' from the human immunoglobulin kappa light-chain 3' enhancer > upstream conserved region from the Moloney murine leukemia virus promoter. Results of DNA binding assays suggest that the differences in enhancer potentials are due to the different binding affinities of YY1 to the various motifs and the binding of two other transcription factors to the IUE sequence.","['Satyamoorthy, K', 'Park, K', 'Atchison, M L', 'Howe, C C']","['Satyamoorthy K', 'Park K', 'Atchison ML', 'Howe CC']","['Wistar Institute of Anatomy and Biology, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors)', '0 (Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (YY1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (YY1 protein, human)', '0 (Yy1 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Carcinoma, Embryonal', 'Conserved Sequence', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin', '*Genes, Intracisternal A-Particle', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains/genetics', 'Methylation', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nuclear Proteins/isolation & purification/metabolism', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Binding', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Transcription Factors/isolation & purification/*metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'YY1 Transcription Factor']",1993/11/01 00:00,1993/11/01 00:01,['1993/11/01 00:00'],"['1993/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/mcb.13.11.6621-6628.1993 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1993 Nov;13(11):6621-8. doi: 10.1128/mcb.13.11.6621-6628.1993.,,,,,PMC364725,,,"['GM37762/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'GM47421/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'HD25078/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States']",,

We have identified a Tax-responsive element (TxRE) from -164 to -145 bp in the IL-2 enhancer which is sufficient to confer Tax responsiveness. A 45-kDa nuclear protein (TxRE-binding factor [TxREF]), present in Tax-expressing Jurkat cell lines but not in Jurkat cells without Tax, specifically interacts with the 5' TxRE sequence from -164 to -154. Deletion or mutation of this 5' TxRE sequence removes the binding of TxREF in vitro and dramatically reduces Tax activity in vivo. In addition, this site is responsible for the cyclosporin A-resistant expression of the IL-2 enhancer in the presence of Tax. Although the TxREF binding site contains an NF-kappa B like motif, UV cross-linking studies as well as gel retardation analysis reveal that TxREF is distinct from NF-kappa B. These results demonstrate that TxREF is a novel Tax-inducible DNA-binding protein and that TxRE plays a crucial role in mediating Tax-induced IL-2 gene expression.","['Li, M', 'Siekevitz, M']","['Li M', 'Siekevitz M']","['Department of Microbiology, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, New York 10029.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'DNA', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', '*Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Gene Products, tax/*metabolism', 'HeLa Cells', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism/microbiology', 'Transcriptional Activation']",1993/10/01 00:00,1993/10/01 00:01,['1993/10/01 00:00'],"['1993/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/mcb.13.10.6490-6500.1993 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1993 Oct;13(10):6490-500. doi: 10.1128/mcb.13.10.6490-6500.1993.,,,,,PMC364708,,,['AI 27053/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,

Electrophoretic mobility shift analysis of cell extracts identified two AML-1-containing protein-DNA complexes whose electrophoretic mobilities were slower than those of complexes formed with AML-1 produced in vitro. Mixing of in vitro-produced AML-1 with cell extracts prior to gel mobility shift analysis resulted in the formation of higher-order complexes. Deletion mutagenesis of AML-1 revealed that the runt homology domain mediates both sequence-specific DNA binding and protein-protein interactions.

The predominant underlying diagnosis was acute leukemia (lymphoblastic, n = 6; non-lymphoblastic, n = 2); two patients had chronic myeloid leukemia, two Hodgkin's disease, and three other solid tumors. Patients ranged from 7 to 27 years of age at diagnosis of this complication, with a median interval of 25 months (range, 0-11 years) from primary diagnosis. Both steroids and radiation therapy appear implicated in the pathogenesis of avascular necrosis: nine patients had received high cumulative doses of prednisone (3.4-14 g/m2), four had received 35-64.8 Gy local irradiation involving the femoral head, and one underwent total body irradiation (12 Gy). Of the 11 surviving patients, six are asymptomatic and fully active. Two patients have joint pain that is responsive to conservative measures. Severe pain and joint deterioration necessitated arthroplasty in two cases, and a third child is undergoing orthopedic evaluation because of worsening symptoms. Thus, like adult cancer patients, children who receive high doses of steroids or local irradiation involving femoral heads are at risk for avascular necrosis. In patients with chronic myeloid leukemia, the complication may be disease related. Although outcomes in our series are better than those reported in adults, the long period of risk for these children and young adults precludes definitive conclusions.","['Hanif, I', 'Mahmoud, H', 'Pui, C H']","['Hanif I', 'Mahmoud H', 'Pui CH']","[""Department of Hematology-Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38101.""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Med Pediatr Oncol,Medical and pediatric oncology,7506654,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Femur Head Necrosis/*etiology', 'Hodgkin Disease/therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/therapy', 'Lymphoma/therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/therapy', 'Neoplasms/*therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/therapy', 'Risk Factors', 'Sarcoma/therapy', 'Sarcoma, Ewing/therapy', 'Sarcoma, Synovial/therapy', 'Time Factors']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/mpo.2950210909 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Pediatr Oncol. 1993;21(9):655-60. doi: 10.1002/mpo.2950210909.,,,,,,,,"['CA 20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,

DESIGN: Records of patients treated by the Department of Haematology and Oncology at the Prince of Wales Children's Hospital were reviewed to determine the survival of children with cancer according to decade of diagnosis and diagnostic group. PATIENTS: Patients were eligible for the study if referred for treatment at or soon after diagnosis of malignancy. One thousand patients were treated during the study period. There were 363 with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), 126 with tumours of the central nervous system (CNS), 86 with acute non-lymphoblastic leukaemia (ANLL), 81 with lymphoma, 79 with neural crest tumours, 69 with renal tumours, 66 with bone sarcomas, 53 with soft tissue sarcomas, and 77 with various other diagnoses. Age range was one day to 20.75 years. INTERVENTIONS: Treatment included surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy in a variety of protocols. RESULTS: Ten-year survival for the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s was 15%, 51% and 64% respectively (P < 0.001), excluding tumours of the CNS. From 1985 onwards, actual survival at five years has been 79%. Survival from Wilms' tumour and Hodgkin's disease remained high throughout the study period, and significant improvement in survival occurred with ALL, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and osteogenic sarcoma. Survival remained poor with neuroblastoma and ANLL. CONCLUSIONS: Significant improvement in outcomes for childhood malignancy has been achieved over the last three decades, with five-year survival currently at 79% (excluding tumours of the CNS). Some diagnostic groups have had only small improvements in outcome and require new strategies.","['McCowage, G B', 'Vowels, M R', 'Brown, R', ""O'Gorman-Hughes, D"", 'White, L', 'Marshall, G']","['McCowage GB', 'Vowels MR', 'Brown R', ""O'Gorman-Hughes D"", 'White L', 'Marshall G']","[""Department of Haematology and Oncology, Prince of Wales Children's Hospital, Randwick, NSW.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Australia,Med J Aust,The Medical journal of Australia,0400714,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Hodgkin Disease/mortality/therapy', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Kidney Neoplasms/mortality/therapy', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/mortality/therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/mortality/therapy', 'Neoplasms/*mortality/therapy', 'Neuroblastoma/mortality/therapy', 'New South Wales', 'Oncology Service, Hospital/*statistics & numerical data', '*Pediatrics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/mortality/therapy', 'Sarcoma/mortality/therapy', 'Survival Analysis', 'Wilms Tumor/mortality/therapy']",1993/10/04 00:00,1993/10/04 00:01,['1993/10/04 00:00'],"['1993/10/04 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/10/04 00:01 [medline]', '1993/10/04 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,"Med J Aust. 1993 Oct 4;159(7):453-5, 458.",,,,,,,,,,

Doxorubicin accelerated the TAID in both cell lines with a detection limit of 50 micrograms/ml for MCF-7 cells and 500 micrograms/ml doxorubicin for HL-60 cells. Preincubation of cells with the iron chelating agent, deferoxamine (5 mM), partially prevented the effects of doxorubicin on the TAID.

The nucleotide sequence analysis of the amplified product showed the presence of an out-of-frame V beta/J gamma/C gamma transcript and an in-frame V gamma/J gamma/C beta transcript which result from an interlocus recombination between the TCR-beta and gamma loci and the transcription of the reciprocal hybrid TCR gene. The sequence analysis of the reciprocal DNA segment directly involved in the breakpoint of the inversion showed a recombination between a J gamma-sequence heptamer signal and a coding J beta gene segment. The exonuclease nibbling of each DNA extremity and the non-templated nucleotide insertion observed at both coding and reciprocal joints demonstrate that the inversion is mediated by the lymphocyte recombinase complex. During T-cell differentiation, TCR-beta genes are rearranged prior to TCR-alpha genes. In the present case of T-ALL, we have shown that TCR-delta genes are rearranged at both loci, excluding productive rearrangements of TCR-alpha genes. The molecular analysis of the normal TCR genes derived from the leukemic cells revealed the presence of productively rearranged TCR-beta, gamma, and delta genes. Cell surface staining of these cells showed the presence of CD3 molecules and of a TCR-beta chain corresponding to the normal beta allele expressed in a disulfide-linked complex with a protein which is not TCR-alpha, gamma, or delta.

Acute myelocytic leukemia was induced in six Brown-Norway rats, and complement levels were assayed during the course of the disease. Whole complement activity (CH50) and hemolytic activity of C1q, C3, and C4 decreased from day 16 after induction of the leukemia, when the rats developed pulmonary leukostasis. In addition, local complement activation was established in the lung vessels by immunofluorescence microscopy in advanced stages of pulmonary leukostasis. Finally, following systemic activation of the complement system by injection of cobra venom factor (CVF), leukemic rats (n = 6) died of pulmonary leukostasis 4.5 days earlier than did leukemic controls (n = 6). These findings suggest that, in acute myelocytic leukemia in Brown-Norway rats, pulmonary leukostasis is induced by activation of the complement system.

The initial t1/2 in serum after i.v. injection was about 10 minutes and the terminal t1/2 close to 2 hours. Subcutaneous administration resulted in plateau levels after 2 to 4 hours, while the apparent terminal t1/2 was similar to that after i.v. infusion. The bioavailability of IL-3 following subcutaneous administration was only about 40% of that following i.v. administration. Hemopoietic effects of continuous i.v. infusion of IL-3 was then compared to s.c. administration in either one, two, or three daily injections. Doses chosen ranged from 1 to 30 micrograms/kg per day. In agreement with the more limited bioavailability of IL-3 following s.c. administration, continuous i.v. infusion was much more effective in stimulating hemopoiesis than s.c. administration. Two or three daily s.c. injections did not improve the hemopoietic response compared to a single s.c. injection, which is in agreement with the apparent terminal t1/2 of 101 min.

The 4.4 kb tie mRNA was expressed at high levels in five of five human megakaryoblastic leukemia cell lines studied and in two IL-3-dependent mouse myeloid leukemia cell lines, but not in 42 other leukemia cell lines representing various hematopoietic lineages.

Among several cell lines from solid tumors, two fibrosarcomas, one rhabdomyosarcoma and one melanoma cell line were positive for tie mRNA.

Our results indicate that the development of stromal adherent layers in AML long-term marrow culture (LTMC) depends to a large extent on the presence of fibroblastic progenitors (fibroblast colony-forming units, CFU-F) in the bone marrow inoculum. Positive correlations were observed between the numbers of CFU-F in fresh AML marrow samples (nine cases studied) and the numbers of adherent nucleated cells (r = 0.91), adherent CFU-F (r = 0.87), adherent hemopoietic progenitors (r = 0.71), and colony-stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1) levels (r = 0.74) in LTMC. All the above parameters were drastically reduced in LTMC derived from AML marrows that contained low numbers of CFU-F (i.e. below the normal range of 76-130 CFU-F per 10(6) bone marrow cells) when compared with LTMC established from normal marrows. In contrast, no difference was observed in such parameters when normal LTMC and LTMC from AML patients with normal levels of marrow CFU-F were compared. Fibroblast adherent layers derived from AML patients with normal marrow CFU-F numbers produced normal levels of CSF-1 and showed a similar hemopoietic supportive capacity to that of fibroblast layers from normal bone marrow. Thus, our results suggest that (i) the presence of CFU-F in adequate levels in the bone marrow inoculum is critical for the adequate development of the hemopoietic microenvironment in LTMC, and (ii) AML marrow-derived fibroblasts seem to be functionally normal, at least in some AML patients.","['Mayani, H', 'Guilbert, L J', 'Janowska-Wieczorek, A']","['Mayani H', 'Guilbert LJ', 'Janowska-Wieczorek A']","['Department of Medicine, University of Alberta, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)'],IM,"['Bone Marrow/pathology', '*Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Adhesion/physiology', 'Cell Division/physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/biosynthesis/physiology', 'Fibroblasts/*cytology/pathology/*physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology/physiopathology', 'Time Factors']",1993/10/01 00:00,1993/10/01 00:01,['1993/10/01 00:00'],"['1993/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1993 Oct;7(10):1564-9.,,,,,,,,,,

We also performed Southern blot hybridization analysis to examine p53 gene rearrangements in 13 cases of Ph1AL. We found a rearrangement in one case of Ph1ALL and a loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at the p53 locus without any rearrangement in another Ph1ALL. Both cases showed no abnormality within the entire coding region by SSCP analysis. Thus, p53 gene alterations were commonly involved in Ph1AL with loss of a 17p (two point mutations in three cases), while rarely in cases with normal chromosome 17s (one point mutation in 20 cases and one rearrangement in 13 cases). Rare p53 gene alterations in Ph1AL may therefore be related to low incidence of loss of a chromosome 17p.","['Nakai, H', 'Misawa, S', 'Tanaka, S', 'Nishigaki, H', 'Taniwaki, M', 'Yokota, S', 'Horiike, S', 'Takashima, T', 'Seriu, T', 'Nakagawa, H']","['Nakai H', 'Misawa S', 'Tanaka S', 'Nishigaki H', 'Taniwaki M', 'Yokota S', 'Horiike S', 'Takashima T', 'Seriu T', 'Nakagawa H', 'et al.']","['Department of Medicine, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA, Single-Stranded)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosome Aberrations', '*Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 18/*physiology', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis/genetics', 'DNA, Single-Stranded/analysis/genetics', 'Exons/genetics', 'Female', 'Genes, p53/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nucleic Acid Conformation', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Point Mutation/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Polymorphism, Genetic/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics']",1993/10/01 00:00,1993/10/01 00:01,['1993/10/01 00:00'],"['1993/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1993 Oct;7(10):1547-51.,,,"['RAS', 'p53']",,,,,,,

For this purpose we have developed reagents allowing quantitative Western-blot analysis, and quantification of Op18 on the single cell level by flow cytometric analysis. The data demonstrates that a significant fraction of all lymphoma and leukemia cases express Op18 at levels that are several-fold higher than the Op18 levels ever found in benign proliferating tissue, such as bone marrows in remission and reactive lymph nodes. Thus, the results establish on the single cell level that Op18 is frequently expressed at abnormal levels in lymphoid and myeloid malignancies. Flow cytometric analysis revealed a striking qualitative and quantitative heterogeneity in Op18 expression between patients with lymphoma or leukemia. Moreover, our analysis demonstrates that the abnormal cellular levels of Op18 expression frequently found in high grade lymphoma and acute leukemia samples do not correlate with an increased fraction of cells in S phase.

Australian and New Zealand Children's Cancer Study Group.,1514-20,"Techniques based on the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect rearrangement of the immunoglobulin or T-cell receptor genes can detect residual disease in leukemia and hence have the potential to improve prognosis and treatment. Such techniques may involve either detection of monoclonality, which is simple and quick but has limited sensitivity, or specific detection of the leukaemic clone, which is complex and time-consuming but has high sensitivity. The PCR was used to detect monoclonal rearrangements of the immunoglobulin heavy chain and/or T-cell receptor gamma chain genes in archival marrow specimens from 185 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia who achieved remission during two consecutive Australasian trials of treatment. A monoclonal rearrangement was detected at diagnosis in 152 (84%) patients and in these patients detection of the same rearrangement in the remission marrow at the end of induction therapy was highly significantly correlated with outcome. There were nine patients in whom polymerase chain reaction showed only the monoclonal rearrangement and eight (89%) relapsed; there were 26 patients in whom PCR showed the leukemic monoclonal rearrangement as well as polyclonal rearrangements from normal lymphocytes and 12 (46%) relapsed; and there were 117 patients in whom only polyclonal rearrangements could be detected and only 29 (25%) relapsed. In patients who relapsed, remissions were shorter in those patients in whom the leukemic rearrangements had been detected in the remission marrow. Treatment in the later trial was more intensive than in the earlier trial, the results were better and the PCR detected the leukemic rearrangement in the remission marrow in significantly fewer patients. We conclude that detection by PCR of the monoclonal gene rearrangement of the leukemic clone in remission marrow indicates that numerous leukemic cells have survived induction therapy and is a good predictor of relapse. However, due to limited sensitivity of the test, failure to detect the leukemic clone by PCR is not a sufficiently good predictor of ultimate cure.","['Brisco, M J', 'Condon, J', 'Hughes, E', 'Neoh, S H', 'Nicholson, I', 'Sykes, P J', 'Tauro, G', 'Ekert, H', 'Waters, K', 'Toogood, I']","['Brisco MJ', 'Condon J', 'Hughes E', 'Neoh SH', 'Nicholson I', 'Sykes PJ', 'Tauro G', 'Ekert H', 'Waters K', 'Toogood I', 'et al.']","['Department of Hematology, Flinders Medical Centre, Bedford Park, South Australia.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow/chemistry/*physiology', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Clone Cells/physiology', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis/genetics', 'Gene Amplification', 'Gene Rearrangement/genetics', 'Gene Rearrangement, gamma-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor/genetics', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Lymphocytes/physiology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*genetics/pathology', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta/genetics', 'Remission Induction']",1993/10/01 00:00,1993/10/01 00:01,['1993/10/01 00:00'],"['1993/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1993 Oct;7(10):1514-20.,,,"['IgH', 'TCR&ggr;']",,,,,,,

These alterations consist of either a tald submicroscopic deletion (12-26% of T-ALL) or a t(1;14)(p32;q11) chromosomal translocation (3% of childhood T-ALL). Both types of alterations preferentially affect the 5' part of the TAL1 locus. Their main consequence appears to be transcriptional activation of the TAL1 gene. We have characterized two cases of t(1;14)(p32;q11) in ALL. Both affect the TCR delta gene segments at 14q11 and the 5' part of the TAL1 locus at 1p32. The first case represented a 'classical' t(1;14), associated with T-ALL. Its analysis indicates the use of a recombination signal-like sequence localized in the third exon of TAL1 in the translocation process. In the other case, the rearrangement to the D delta region occurred 5' to the TAL1 transcription start sites. This case exhibited a B-lymphoid immunophenotype thus suggesting that the putative oncogenicity of TAL1 activation is not restricted to T-cell malignancies.","['Bernard, O', 'Barin, C', 'Charrin, C', 'Mathieu-Mahul, D', 'Berger, R']","['Bernard O', 'Barin C', 'Charrin C', 'Mathieu-Mahul D', 'Berger R']","['U. 301 I.N.S.E.R.M.-I.

Most inhibitors of protein serine/threonine kinases inhibited the growth of Mm-A and Mm-S2 cells similarly, but some protein tyrosine kinase inhibitors exhibited differential inhibitory effects on Mm-A and Mm-S2 cells. Genistein inhibited growth of Mm-A cells more effectively than that of Mm-S2 cells, but another inhibitor of tyrosine kinase, herbimycin A, preferentially inhibited growth of non-leukemogenic Mm-S2 cells. Genistein induced or enhanced several differentiation markers of Mm-S2 cells, such as cell spreading, immunophagocytosis, nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) reduction and lysozyme activity in a dose-dependent manner, but herbimycin A did not. Genistein was cytotoxic to Mm-A cells rather than inducing cell differentiation. Genistein has effects on several other cellular events as well as inhibition of tyrosine kinases. However, it effectively inhibited protein tyrosine phosphorylation in Mm-A cells and its decrease of tyrosine phosphorylation was closely associated with its inhibition of cell growth.

The cytotoxicity of Kc against K562 increased as the effector:target (E:T) ratio rose and reached its maximum level of about 18% at an E:T ratio of 20:1. [3H]TdR incorporation into target cells (P815 and AH130) was also inhibited by Kc.

In the experiment of the inoculation of AH130 via the portal vein, OK432 decreased the number of hepatic foci, whereas macrophage inhibitors carrageenan and gadolinium increased the number of tumor nodules. In addition, gadolinium injection reduced the number of Kupffer cells reactive with monoclonal antibodies directed against macrophages ED2 and Ki-M2R. Tumor growth in the liver was maximum in rats with both gadolinium treatment and splenectomy. In conclusion, Kc have antitumor activity, and augmentation of Kc may be a possible strategy to prevent hematogenous hepatic metastasis.","['Zhang, W', 'Arii, S', 'Sasaoki, T', 'Adachi, Y', 'Funaki, N', 'Higashitsuji, H', 'Fujita, S', 'Furutani, M', 'Mise, M', 'Ishiguro, S']","['Zhang W', 'Arii S', 'Sasaoki T', 'Adachi Y', 'Funaki N', 'Higashitsuji H', 'Fujita S', 'Furutani M', 'Mise M', 'Ishiguro S', 'et al.']","['First Department of Surgery, Faculty of Medicine, Kyoto University, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Surg Res,The Journal of surgical research,0376340,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Chromium Radioisotopes)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Autoradiography', 'Cell Division', 'Chromium Radioisotopes', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Humans', 'Kupffer Cells/*immunology', 'Leukemia', 'Liver Neoplasms, Experimental/immunology/*pathology', 'Macrophages/immunology', 'Male', 'Mast-Cell Sarcoma', 'Mice', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Splenectomy', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/08/01 00:00,1993/08/01 00:01,['1993/08/01 00:00'],"['1993/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0022480483711212 [pii]', '10.1006/jsre.1993.1121 [doi]']",ppublish,J Surg Res. 1993 Aug;55(2):140-6. doi: 10.1006/jsre.1993.1121.,,,,,,,,,,

An evaluation of current recommendations.,1826-31,"OBJECTIVE: To determine pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine efficacy in selected populations at risk for serious pneumococcal infection for whom vaccination is currently recommended and to assess duration of protection after vaccination. DESIGN: Vaccine efficacy was estimated using indirect cohort analysis to compare the proportion of pneumococcal infections caused by serotypes included in the vaccines of vaccinated and unvaccinated persons who were identified during 14 years of national surveillance. SETTING: Hospital laboratories in the United States that submitted pneumococcal isolates to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention between May 1978 and April 1992. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 2837 persons older than 5 years who had pneumococcus isolated from blood or cerebrospinal fluid. RESULTS: Overall efficacy for preventing infection caused by serotypes included in the vaccine was 57% (95% confidence interval [CI], 45% to 66%). Efficacy among persons with diabetes mellitus was 84% (95% CI, 50% to 95%); with coronary vascular disease, 73% (95% CI, 23% to 90%); with congestive heart failure, 69% (95% CI, 17% to 88%); with chronic pulmonary diseases, 65% (95% CI, 26% to 83%); and with anatomic asplenia, 77% (95% CI, 14% to 95%). Efficacy was not documented for patients with alcoholism or cirrhosis, sickle cell disease, chronic renal failure, lymphoma, leukemia, or multiple myeloma, although sample sizes were small for these groups. Efficacy for immunocompetent persons older than 65 years was 75% (95% CI, 57% to 85%). Efficacy did not decline with increasing interval after vaccination: 5 to 8 years after vaccination it was 71% (95% CI, 24% to 89%), and 9 years or more after vaccination it was 80% (95% CI, 16% to 95%).

These sarcoma viruses contain ras oncogenes flanked on both sides by retrotransposon VL30 element sequences, in turn flanked by mouse leukemia virus sequences. Three very basic questions have existed about the VL30 element sequences found in sarcoma viruses: (i) how did they become recombined, (ii) what are their exact boundaries, and (iii) why are they there? To help decipher the nature of VL30 elements in sarcoma viruses, we examined VL30 clones isolated from an anoxic fibroblast cDNA library and independently by polymerase chain reaction cloning from rat cell DNA. Sequence comparisons with HaSV revealed that HaSV was formed by the substitution of 0.7 kb of VL30 sequences by 0.9 kb of c-Ha-ras sequences, with this event possibly facilitated by the presence of an identical Alu-like repeat found upstream of the 5' recombination point in both the VL30 element and c-Ha-ras. Recombination occurred 42 bases beyond the Alu-like sequences in VL30 and 1596 bases beyond them in c-Ha-ras, at position 926 of HaSV. The 3' ras-VL30 recombination event in HaSV occurred within a seven-base region of shared sequence identity, between HaSV bases 1825 and 1825 and 1831. Recombination between Moloney leukemia virus (MoLV) and VL30 appears to have occurred at a point corresponding to base 218 or 219 of MoLV and was near a TAR-like VL30 sequence; such recombination at the 3' end was between positions 7445 and 7456 of MoLV (HaSV positions 4694 to 4703). Kirsten murine sarcoma virus was found to be closely analogous to HaSV, and limited similar features were also seen with Rasheed sarcoma virus.","['Firulli, B A', 'Anderson, G R', 'Stoler, D L', 'Estes, S D']","['Firulli BA', 'Anderson GR', 'Stoler DL', 'Estes SD']","['Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, New York 14263-0001.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,['0 (DNA Transposable Elements)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cloning, Molecular', '*DNA Transposable Elements', 'Genes, ras', 'Hydrogen Bonding', 'Hypoxia', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nucleic Acid Conformation', 'Rats', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid']",1993/11/01 00:00,1993/11/01 00:01,['1993/11/01 00:00'],"['1993/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.67.11.6857-6862.1993 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1993 Nov;67(11):6857-62. doi: 10.1128/JVI.67.11.6857-6862.1993.,,,,,PMC238132,,,['CA48828/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['GENBANK/M91234', 'GENBANK/M91235']",

Sequencing of a portion of GLVR1 from the rat (which is infectible) confirmed the importance of this cluster in that it contained the only notable differences between the rat and mouse proteins.

In order to better understand the pathological process leading to these neurodegenerative lesions, we have investigated the nature of the cell type(s) infected by the virus during the course of the disease in CFW/D and SWR/J mice. For this purpose, we used in situ hybridization with virus-specific probes in combination with cell-type-specific histochemical (lectin) and immunological markers as well as morphological assessment. In the early stage of infection, endothelial cells represented the main cell type expressing viral RNA in the central nervous system (CNS). With disease progression and the appearance of lesions, microglial cells became the major cell type infected, accounting for up to 65% of the total infected cell population in diseased areas. Morphologically, these cells appeared activated and were frequently found in clusters. Infection and activation of microglial cells were almost exclusively restricted to diseased regions of the CNS. Neurons in diseased regions were not discernibly infected with virus at either early or late times of disease progression. Similarly, the proportion of infected astrocytes was typically < 1%. Although some endothelial cells and oligodendrocytes were infected by the virus, their infection was not limited to diseased CNS regions. These results are consistent with a model of indirect motor neuron degeneration, subsequent to the infection of nonneuronal CNS cells and especially of microglial cells. Infected microglial cells may play a role in the disease process by releasing not only virions or viral env-gene-encoded gp70 proteins but also other factors which may be directly or indirectly toxic to neurons. Parallels between microglial cell infection by MuLV and by lentiviruses, and specifically by human immunodeficiency virus, are discussed.","['Gravel, C', 'Kay, D G', 'Jolicoeur, P']","['Gravel C', 'Kay DG', 'Jolicoeur P']","['Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Institut de Recherches Cliniques de Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,,IM,"['Animals', 'Astrocytes/microbiology', 'Central Nervous System/microbiology/pathology', 'Endothelium/microbiology', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*pathogenicity', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Microglia/microbiology', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurons/microbiology', 'Oligodendroglia/microbiology', 'Paralysis/microbiology/pathology', 'Prion Diseases/microbiology/*pathology']",1993/11/01 00:00,1993/11/01 00:01,['1993/11/01 00:00'],"['1993/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.67.11.6648-6658.1993 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1993 Nov;67(11):6648-58. doi: 10.1128/JVI.67.11.6648-6658.1993.,,,,,PMC238103,,,,,

Only cisplatin showed statistically significant association of complete and partial clinical response with dose intensity. PURPOSE: This analysis updates the previous results and further characterizes response to cisplatin alone or in multiagent regimens. METHODS: We analyzed data from 18 regimens containing platinum (cisplatin or carboplatin) that were used in nine new randomized trials, in addition to data from the 60 groups of patients in our previous study in which responses were reported. Relative dose intensity was calculated as a fraction of the dosage of a drug in the standard regimen of cyclophosphamide, altretamine, doxorubicin, and platinum (CHAP). We performed single and multiple regression analyses to determine the relationship between disease outcome and relative dose intensity for cyclophosphamide, platinum, and doxorubicin alone or in combination. RESULTS: The association between outcome and dose intensity for platinum alone or in multiagent regimens was statistically significant. This association was of borderline significance for cyclophosphamide alone but was not significant for this drug in multiagent regimens. There were insufficient data to test the relationship for doxorubicin as a single agent, but in multiagent regimens, the relationship was borderline (P = .05). Multiagent regimens containing platinum produced greater response rates than platinum alone for any fixed, planned relative dose intensity for platinum. CONCLUSIONS: Our results support other published findings that use of cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin increases the efficacy of single-agent platinum. Relative dose intensity values for cyclophosphamide used alone were larger than those used in multiagent regimens, which might explain why the relationship between relative dose intensity and outcome for cyclophosphamide was not significant for use in multiagent regimens. Similarly, none of the multiagent regimens incorporated doxorubicin at a relative dose intensity for which the drug is found to be effective as a single agent. IMPLICATIONS: Prospective clinical trials are required to test the effect of higher relative dose intensity for doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide added to platinum in advanced ovarian cancer. An important element in the design of prospective trials will be to test for the relative importance of dose intensity versus total dose. This testing is best achieved in a three-arm study design such as that reported in adjuvant treatment of stage II breast cancer conducted by the Cancer and Leukemia Group B.","['Levin, L', 'Simon, R', 'Hryniuk, W']","['Levin L', 'Simon R', 'Hryniuk W']","['Department of Oncology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Western Ontario, London, Canada.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,"['80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'BG3F62OND5 (Carboplatin)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)', 'Q8BIH59O7H (Altretamine)', 'CISCA protocol', 'CPDD protocol']",IM,"['Altretamine/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Carboplatin/*administration & dosage', 'Cisplatin/*administration & dosage', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Regression Analysis']",1993/11/03 00:00,1993/11/03 00:01,['1993/11/03 00:00'],"['1993/11/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/11/03 00:01 [medline]', '1993/11/03 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/jnci/85.21.1732 [doi]'],ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1993 Nov 3;85(21):1732-42. doi: 10.1093/jnci/85.21.1732.,,,,['J Natl Cancer Inst. 1994 Jul 20;86(14):1098-9.

These proteins enable the cell to survive and recover from stressful conditions by as yet uncompletely understood mechanisms. Hsp27 is an important small Hsp (molecular weight, 27,000) found in human cells--both cancer cells and normal cells. This protein, besides its putative role in thermotolerance, is of special clinical interest because of recent data suggesting it may also play a role in drug resistance. In adults, Hsp27 is found particularly in several cell types such as breast, uterus, cervix, placenta, skin, and platelets. Although low-molecular-weight (small) Hsps have been found to be involved in embryogenesis of Xenopus and Drosophila, they have not been detected in human fetal organs. Regulation of expression of the Hsp gene (also known as HSPB1) has been considered a paradigm of gene regulation and is actively being studied in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. In prokaryotes, the major Hsp genes are transcriptionally regulated by positively and negatively acting transcription factors. In eukaryotes, the genes encoding Hsps contain a regulatory DNA motif (inverted repeats of the pentameric sequence nGAAn) known as the heat shock element. Hsp27 may function as a molecular chaperone and in signal transduction pathways of different cell regulators, and Hsp27 and other Hsps may be active in development of resistance to stressful conditions and agents including cytotoxic drugs. Study findings indicate that some but not all estrogen-positive breast cancers express Hsp27, and overexpression of Hsp27 has been associated with both good and poor prognosis. In endometrial carcinomas, the presence of Hsp27 is correlated with the degree of tumor differentiation as well as with the presence of estrogen and progesterone receptors. Studies suggest, however, that detection of Hsp27 should not be considered to be a method for identifying hormone-responsive tumors or detecting estrogen receptors. Hsp27 seems to be a biochemical marker of estrogenic endometrial response. In patients with cervical cancer, Hsp27 is predominantly expressed in well-differentiated and moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinomas. In addition, expression of Hsp27 seems to be a negative prognostic factor for gastric cancer. Different isoforms of Hsp27 have been found in lymphoid tissue of patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and the protein has also been associated with viral infections. These aspects are summarized and discussed in the present review.","['Ciocca, D R', 'Oesterreich, S', 'Chamness, G C', 'McGuire, W L', 'Fuqua, S A']","['Ciocca DR', 'Oesterreich S', 'Chamness GC', 'McGuire WL', 'Fuqua SA']","['Department of Medicine, University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio 78284-7884.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,['0 (Heat-Shock Proteins)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Gene Expression', 'Heat-Shock Proteins/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/metabolism']",1993/10/06 00:00,1993/10/06 00:01,['1993/10/06 00:00'],"['1993/10/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/10/06 00:01 [medline]', '1993/10/06 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/jnci/85.19.1558 [doi]'],ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1993 Oct 6;85(19):1558-70. doi: 10.1093/jnci/85.19.1558.,187,,,,,,,"['CA11378/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30CA54174/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,

Topoisomerase I (T-I) inhibition data (IC50) have been obtained by standard procedures. In general, substitution at the 9 or 10 positions with amino, halogeno, or hydroxyl groups in compounds with 20S configuration results in compounds with enhanced T-I inhibition. Compounds in the 20RS configuration were less active in vitro and in vivo and those in the 20R configuration were inactive. Compounds with 10,11-methylenedioxy substitution on ring A displayed a marked increase in potency in the T-I inhibition assay. The activities of some of the analogs as determined in a variety of in vivo assays including the L-1210 mouse leukemia assay were, in general, in accord with T-I inhibition. A number of water-soluble analogs such as 20-glycinate esters, 9-glycinamides, or hydrolyzed lactone salts were prepared and tested in in vitro and in vivo assays. In general, these compounds were less active than CPT both in terms of T-I inhibition and life prolongation in the L-1210 assay.

Fifty-one patients received 2400 cGy cranial irradiation (XRT), and 58 patients received no XRT. All patients had no central nervous system involvement at diagnosis, achieved and maintained a complete response, entered puberty spontaneously, and had achieved final height. Height data were converted to standardized deviation scores. Mean age at diagnosis was 7.8 +/- 4.2 years. Distribution of heights at diagnosis was similar to that of the U.S. population. Relative to gender-specific heights for the population, female subjects in this study had lower attained heights than male subjects (p = 0.03). There was a monotonic trend of patients treated at an earlier age to have a reduction in final height (p = 0.057). Cranial irradiation was strongly associated with final height (mean standardized deviation score with XRT = -1.04 and without XRT = -0.14; p < 0.001). Final height was not associated with age at diagnosis, prognostic risk group, or Pediatric Oncology Group protocol. By multivariate analysis, only XRT and XRT x age were significantly associated with final height (p < 0.001 and p = 0.002, respectively). There was no significant gender effect. We conclude that XRT is significantly associated with reduced final adult height after treatment for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia. For survivors, therapy devoid of XRT does not appear to affect final height.","['Katz, J A', 'Pollock, B H', 'Jacaruso, D', 'Morad, A']","['Katz JA', 'Pollock BH', 'Jacaruso D', 'Morad A']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Pediatr,The Journal of pediatrics,0375410,,IM,"['Adolescent', '*Body Height', 'Child', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Combined Modality Therapy', '*Cranial Irradiation', 'Female', 'Growth Disorders/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/epidemiology/*therapy', 'Reference Values', 'Sex Characteristics']",1993/10/01 00:00,1993/10/01 00:01,['1993/10/01 00:00'],"['1993/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0022-3476(05)80948-5 [pii]', '10.1016/s0022-3476(05)80948-5 [doi]']",ppublish,J Pediatr. 1993 Oct;123(4):546-52. doi: 10.1016/s0022-3476(05)80948-5.,,,,,,,,"['CA-29139/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-30969/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-33625/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,

METHODS: Individual doses of 30 to 50 mCi of 131I on 25 mg OKB7 were administered 2 to 3 days apart to achieve four total 131I-OKB7 dose levels of 90, 120, 160, and 200 mCi. Pharmacology, dosimetry, therapeutic effects, toxicity, human anti-mouse antibody (HAMA) response, and maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) were determined. Patients were evaluated by imaging studies (including whole-body gamma camera or single-photon emission computed tomography [SPECT] scans), flow cytometric analysis, bone marrow biopsy, and serial blood sampling. RESULTS: Median plasma and whole-body half-lives (T1/2) were 16 hours and 14 hours, respectively. Plasma and whole-body radiation doses were 0.0081 Gy/mCi and 0.0022 Gy/mCi, respectively. Specific tumor visualization was noted in eight of 18 patients. HAMA was detected in 12 of 16 patients. Nonhematologic toxicity was limited to asymptomatic elevations of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) in five of 15 patients. Hematologic toxicity was observed in six of 18 patients, but was severe in only two patients. MTD in patients with diffuse lymphomatous bone marrow involvement was determined to be 200 mCi in four divided doses of 50 mCi 131I/25 mg OKB7. Antitumor activity was observed in 13 of 18 patients (one partial response [PR] and 12 mixed responses) and was dependent on the 131I-OKB7 dose administered. In general, palpable peripheral lymphadenopathy, enlarged spleens, skin lesions, and circulating OKB7-positive peripheral lymphocytes responded most readily to treatment. 131I-OKB7 was safely administered to a patient in leukemic phase of NHL with prompt subsequent loss of approximately 1 kg of tumor cells from the peripheral blood without associated tumor lysis syndrome. CONCLUSION: Because antitumor activity with tolerable toxicity was observed in the majority of this group of heavily pretreated patients, phase II investigation of mAb OKB7 radioconjugates in the therapy of NHL is warranted.","['Czuczman, M S', 'Straus, D J', 'Divgi, C R', 'Graham, M', 'Garin-Chesa, P', 'Finn, R', 'Myers, J', 'Old, L J', 'Larson, S M', 'Scheinberg, D A']","['Czuczman MS', 'Straus DJ', 'Divgi CR', 'Graham M', 'Garin-Chesa P', 'Finn R', 'Myers J', 'Old LJ', 'Larson SM', 'Scheinberg DA']","['Leukemia, Lymphoma, Clinical Immunology Service, Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10021.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Iodine Radioisotopes)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/immunology/metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Iodine Radioisotopes/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*radiotherapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Radioimmunotherapy/*methods']",1993/10/01 00:00,1993/10/01 00:01,['1993/10/01 00:00'],"['1993/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1993.11.10.2021 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1993 Oct;11(10):2021-9. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1993.11.10.2021.,,,,,,,,['P01CA33049/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a phase I study, 68 patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and accelerated- and blastic-phase CML received induction therapy consisting of cytarabine 3 g/m2 by infusion over 3 hours daily for 5 days, with escalating doses of mitoxantrone 40 to 80 mg/m2 over 1 to 2 days by intravenous infusion over 15 minutes. Mitoxantrone pharmacokinetics were evaluated by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) in 15 patients given a single dose of mitoxantrone ranging from 40 to 80 mg/m2 in combination with cytarabine. RESULTS: Severe, but reversible hyperbilirubinemia (> three times normal) was considered the dose-limiting toxicity, and was observed in 25% of all patients and in 35% of those who received 70 to 80 mg/m2 of mitoxantrone. Other extramedullary toxicity, including cardiac dysfunction, was mild. Myelosuppression was universal and the median time to complete remission (CR) was 28 days (range, 19 to 77). The CR rate for previously untreated and relapsed patients with AML was 85% (17 of 20) and 38% (seven of 18), respectively. Eighty-three percent (15 of 18) of patients with ALL achieved a CR, including all patients with previously untreated disease. Eight of 12 patients with advanced-phase CML achieved a CR. No significant changes in mean mitoxantrone plasma elimination rates (ie, terminal plasma half-life and total-body clearance rate) occurred as the mitoxantrone dose doubled, indicating linear pharmacokinetics. CONCLUSIONS: The recommended phase II dose of mitoxantrone is 80 mg/m2 administered over 15 minutes as a single intravenous infusion in combination with cytarabine 3 g/m2/d for 5 days. At this dose, high concentrations of mitoxantrone are achievable in vivo to levels that have been shown to be extremely cytotoxic in vitro.","['Feldman, E J', 'Alberts, D S', 'Arlin, Z', 'Ahmed, T', 'Mittelman, A', 'Baskind, P', 'Peng, Y M', 'Baier, M', 'Plezia, P']","['Feldman EJ', 'Alberts DS', 'Arlin Z', 'Ahmed T', 'Mittelman A', 'Baskind P', 'Peng YM', 'Baier M', 'Plezia P']","['Division of Neoplastic Diseases, New York Medical College, Valhalla 10595.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Blast Crisis/*drug therapy', 'Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Accelerated Phase/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitoxantrone/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy']",1993/10/01 00:00,1993/10/01 00:01,['1993/10/01 00:00'],"['1993/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1993.11.10.2002 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1993 Oct;11(10):2002-9. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1993.11.10.2002.,,,,,,,,"['CA-17094/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-23074/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,

The French Group on Therapy for Adult Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia.,1990-2001,"PURPOSE: In a prospective multicenter study, we analyzed the benefits of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) in a nonselected group of adult patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and, by a randomized trial, evaluated the effectiveness of autologous BMT over chemotherapy as postremission therapy in patients younger than 50 years who were not candidates for allogeneic BMT. PATIENTS AND METHODS: After induction therapy that randomized patients to receive one of two anthracycline-containing regimens, either daunorubicin (DNR) or zorubicin (ZRB), patients were assigned to postremission treatment according to age and results of HLA typing. Patients younger than 40 years with an HLA-identical sibling (group 1) were scheduled to receive cyclophosphamide 60 mg/kg on days 1 and 2, total-body irradiation (TBI), and allogeneic BMT. Patients older than 50 years (group 2) received the chemotherapy arm composed of three monthly consolidation courses (DNR or ZRB, cytarabine, and asparaginase) followed by maintenance chemotherapy (modified L10 regimen). The remaining population (group 3) was randomly assigned to receive, after the three 1-month consolidation courses, either the chemotherapy arm or autologous BMT following a conditioning regimen similar to that of group 1. RESULTS: Of the 572 assessable patients, 436 achieved complete remission (78% +/- 2% for DNR v 74% +/- 3% for ZRB; P = .3). The estimated 3-year disease-free survival (DFS) rate for the 116 patients included in group 1 was 43% +/- 5%.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-nine of 1,374 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) developed RS. RESULTS: Features associated with RS included systemic symptoms (59%), progressive lymphadenopathy (64%), extranodal involvement (41%), elevation of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH; 82%), and a monoclonal gammopathy (44%). Analysis of the CLL karyotype showed no specific chromosomal abnormality that conferred increased risk; however, multiple abnormalities were common. Patients at all Rai stages and in complete response (CR) were at risk, including three CR patients with no residual disease at the level of detection by dual-parameter flow cytometry or restriction analysis for immunoglobulin (Ig) gene rearrangements. The incidence was not higher in patients who had received prior fludarabine or chlorodeoxyadenosine. The median survival duration was only 5 months, despite multiagent therapy. Patients who responded had prolonged survival durations (P < .001). Three of eight patients who survived more than 1 year had a de novo presentation of both CLL and large-cell lymphoma (LCL). Comparison of surface light-chain analysis from both low- and high-grade components demonstrated isotypic light-chain expression in 12 of 15 patients. Ig heavy- and light-chain gene rearrangement analysis showed identical rearrangement patterns in five of five patients. CONCLUSION: The clinical, laboratory, and survival characteristics of our RS patients were similar to those reported in earlier studies. Ig gene rearrangement and light-chain isotype analysis support a common origin for CLL and LCL. Despite progress in the treatment of CLL, the development of LCL remains a serious complication and continued surveillance in all CLL patients is warranted.","['Robertson, L E', 'Pugh, W', ""O'Brien, S"", 'Kantarjian, H', 'Hirsch-Ginsberg, C', 'Cork, A', 'McLaughlin, P', 'Cabanillas, F', 'Keating, M J']","['Robertson LE', 'Pugh W', ""O'Brien S"", 'Kantarjian H', 'Hirsch-Ginsberg C', 'Cork A', 'McLaughlin P', 'Cabanillas F', 'Keating MJ']","['Department of Hematology, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', '*Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/drug therapy/genetics', '*Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/diagnosis/drug therapy/genetics', 'Male', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Syndrome', 'Treatment Outcome']",1993/10/01 00:00,1993/10/01 00:01,['1993/10/01 00:00'],"['1993/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1993.11.10.1985 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1993 Oct;11(10):1985-9. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1993.11.10.1985.,,,,,,,,,,

The dimerization varies from several hours to a few days depending upon the length of the carbon chain in the alkylamines and the process can be conveniently monitored by 195Pt NMR spectroscopy. All these dimers exhibit two closely separated resonances around -4000 ppm (vs K2PtCl4 at -1620 ppm) in dimethylformamide. Reactions of [Pt(NH3)I2]2 with alkylamines do not yield the desired mixed ammine/amine complexes, which are obtained subsequently by treatment of the alkylamine dimer [Pt(RNH2)I2]2 with ammonium hydroxide in water. By using this latter procedure, a novel class of ammine/amine platinum complexes of the type PtII(NH3)(RNH2)Cl2, PtIV(NH3)(RNH2)X2A2, and PtIV(NH3)(RNH2)(CBDCA)A2.H2O, where X2 = chloro or 1,1-cyclobutanedicarboxylato (CBDCA), A = OH, Cl, or OCOCH3, have been synthesized and characterized by elemental analysis, infrared, and 195Pt NMR spectroscopic techniques.

A partially purified fraction of muscle extract was shown to be heat and trypsin sensitive and rescued motoneurons from naturally occurring cell death in a dose-dependent fashion. Muscle extract had no effect on mitotic activity in the spinal cord and did not alter cell number when administered either before or after the normal cell death period. The survival promoting activity in the muscle extract appears to be developmentally regulated. Treatment with muscle extract during the cell death period did not permanently rescue motoneurons. The motoneuron survival-promoting activity found in skeletal muscle was not present in extracts from a variety of other tissues, including liver, kidney, lung, heart, and smooth muscle. Survival activity was also found in extracts from fetal mouse, rat, and human skeletal muscle. Conditioned medium derived from avian myotube cultures also prevented motoneuron death when administered in vivo to chick embryos. Treatment of embryos in ovo with muscle extract had no effect on several properties of developing muscles. With the exception of cranial motoneurons, treatment with muscle extract did not promote the survival of several other populations of neurons in the central and peripheral nervous system that also exhibit naturally occurring cell death. Initial biochemical characterization suggests that the activity in skeletal muscle is an acidic protein between 10 and 30 kD. Examination of a number of previously characterized growth and trophic agents in our in vivo assay have identified several molecules that promote motoneuron survival to one degree or another. These include S100 beta, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), neurotrophin 4/5 (NT-4/5), ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), transforming growth factor beta (TGF beta), platelet-derived growth factor-AB (PDGF-AB), leukemia inhibitory factor (CDF/LIF), and insulin-like growth factors I and II (IGF). By contrast, the following agents were ineffective: nerve growth factor (NGF), neurotrophin-3 (NT3), epidermal growth factor (EGF), acidic and basic fibroblast growth factors (aFGF, bFGF), and the heparin-binding growth-associated molecule (HB-GAM).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Oppenheim, R W', 'Prevette, D', 'Haverkamp, L J', 'Houenou, L', 'Yin, Q W', 'McManaman, J']","['Oppenheim RW', 'Prevette D', 'Haverkamp LJ', 'Houenou L', 'Yin QW', 'McManaman J']","['Department of Neurobiology and Anatomy, Bowman Gray School of Medicine, Wake Forest University, Winston-Salem, North Carolina 27157.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Neurobiol,Journal of neurobiology,0213640,"['0 (Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Nerve Growth Factors)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Tissue Extracts)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/physiology', 'Chick Embryo/cytology/*metabolism/physiology', 'Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Motor Neurons/*physiology', 'Muscles/*embryology', 'Nerve Growth Factors/pharmacology', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/metabolism/*physiology', 'Neurons/drug effects', 'Rats', 'Tissue Extracts/chemistry/pharmacology']",1993/08/01 00:00,1993/08/01 00:01,['1993/08/01 00:00'],"['1993/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/neu.480240806 [doi]'],ppublish,J Neurobiol. 1993 Aug;24(8):1065-79. doi: 10.1002/neu.480240806.,,,,,,,,['NS20402/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States'],,

The methodology has been developed to identify individual T cell clonotypes with regard to their unique receptor beta chain variable/diversity/joining (VDJ) region gene rearrangement. The technique avoids preselection for a given antigen specificity and is therefore independent of artificial bias introduced by in vitro cell population expansion. This technique was used to detect and identify genetically of malignant clones from heterogeneous mononuclear cell populations from an array of hemato-oncological disorders, including mycosis fungoides/Sezary Syndrome, adult T cell leukemia, and large granular lymphoproliferative disease. An initial primary PCR, directed by a TCR-J beta generic primer and a complement of family-specific TCR-V beta primers, defines predominant T cell receptor variable gene usage. Use of a TCR-J beta generic primer supplants the use of a constant region primer anchor and thus eliminates the need to target mRNA. The process of variable gene screening also expedites gene sequencing. By sequencing through the VDJ juxtaposed region, i.e., the third complementarity determinant region, clonotype-specific primers are developed and used in a secondary clonotype primer-directed PCR (CPD-PCR) to detect, with extreme sensitivity and specificity, unique T cell clonal repertoires. Analysis of the products of the CPD-PCR permits the detection of a single malignant cell among one million polyclonal cells and supercedes the constraints of prior studies that provide a limited evaluation of family variable gene repertoire usage. This strategy may be applied in the detection of minimal residual disease, in surveillance after induction of disease-free states, and in analyzing the effectiveness of purging autologous bone marrow of malignant clones.","['Beers, T', 'Du, T L', 'Rickert, M', 'Overturf, P', 'Choi, Y', 'Greenberg, S J']","['Beers T', 'Du TL', 'Rickert M', 'Overturf P', 'Choi Y', 'Greenberg SJ']","['Department of Neurology, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, NY 14263.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Bone Marrow Purging', 'Clone Cells', 'DNA Primers', '*Gene Rearrangement, beta-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics/immunology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasms/genetics/immunology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*analysis', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/*genetics', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/*immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/10/01 00:00,1993/10/01 00:01,['1993/10/01 00:00'],"['1993/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jlb.54.4.343 [doi]'],ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 1993 Oct;54(4):343-50. doi: 10.1002/jlb.54.4.343.,,,,,,,,,,

One signal primes or sensitizes the cells, while the second activates them for killing. The present studies were designed to analyze the capacity of rat macrophages to be activated for nitric oxide production and for cytotoxicity by different inflammatory stimuli. We found that both resident alveolar macrophages (AMs) and resident peritoneal macrophages (PMs) from Sprague-Dawley rats produced nitric oxide in response to relatively low doses of a single exogenous activating stimulus [interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS)]. Resident PMs treated with either of these agents alone also exhibited nitric oxide-mediated cytotoxicity toward xenogeneic and allogeneic tumor targets. In contrast to results reported previously with both resident and elicited PMs from mice, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) exerted only a small enhancing effect on IFN-gamma-induced nitric oxide production by resident rat PMs. In addition, although some level of cooperativity between IFN-gamma and LPS was observed at low concentrations of LPS (< 10 ng/ml), IFN-gamma did not augment the effects of higher concentrations of LPS (> or = 10 ng/ml) on nitric oxide production by PMs. In contrast to PMs, AMs had a strong synergistic response to combinations of IFN-gamma and LPS or TNF-alpha but also only at relatively low concentrations of IFN-gamma and LPS. Furthermore, maximum nitric oxide production induced by IFN-gamma in these cells could be enhanced by TNF-alpha or low doses of LPS. However, as observed with PMs, combinations of IFN-gamma and higher doses of LPS did not significantly augment maximum nitric oxide production induced in AMs by LPS alone. Thus, our data suggest that resident rat PMs and AMs resemble elicited mouse PMs in their ability to respond to a single activating stimulus. However, PMs and in some respects AMs differ from the latter by their reduced responsiveness to combinations of activators. Taken together, our results suggest that two exogenous stimuli are not required for full activation of resident macrophages from Sprague-Dawley rats.","['Lavnikova, N', 'Drapier, J C', 'Laskin, D L']","['Lavnikova N', 'Drapier JC', 'Laskin DL']","['Rutgers University, Piscataway, New Jersey 08855-0789.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,"['0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '27JT06E6GR (omega-N-Methylarginine)', '31C4KY9ESH (Nitric Oxide)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', '94ZLA3W45F (Arginine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Arginine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute', 'Lipopolysaccharides/pharmacology', 'Macrophage Activation/*drug effects', 'Macrophages, Alveolar/drug effects/metabolism/*physiology', 'Mast-Cell Sarcoma', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Nitric Oxide/*biosynthesis', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology', 'omega-N-Methylarginine']",1993/10/01 00:00,1993/10/01 00:01,['1993/10/01 00:00'],"['1993/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jlb.54.4.322 [doi]'],ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 1993 Oct;54(4):322-8. doi: 10.1002/jlb.54.4.322.,,,,,,,,['ES04738/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States'],,

The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to amplify a large diversity of rearranged Ig H chain genes in normal or infected mice, 2 and 8 wk after virus inoculation. Libraries were constructed from the polymerase chain reaction products. By sequencing V-D-J clones in these libraries and analyzing the respective complementary determining region 3 (CDR3), we have shown at 8 wk the emergence of a population of B cells with significantly less N diversity, some sequences lacking any N addition, a typical feature of fetal repertoires known for degeneracy, and autoreactivities. This decreased N diversity was not present 2 wk after inoculation and could not be related to a defect in terminal deoxytransferase expression because the steady-state levels of terminal deoxytransferase mRNA were found normal in MAIDS bone marrow 8 wk after inoculation. FACS analyses revealed a decreased number of bone marrow B cells (B220+, sIgM+) in MAIDS already present at 2 wk, suggesting an alteration in the pathway of B cell differentiation and resulting in a decrease of peripheral B cells renewal.

Subsequently mice were transplanted with F1 (syngeneic), BALB (allogeneic to the host but syngeneic to the tumor), C57BL/6 (B6) (allogeneic to both host and tumor) spleen cells, or spleen cells mixed with syngeneic (F1) bone marrow cells, respectively. Fresh BALB (H-2d) and B6 (H-2b) spleen cells, which induce equally strong GVHD in the F1 recipient against H-2b and H-2d alloantigens, respectively, were assayed for their ability to induce GVL effects on BCL1 (H-2d) cells with and without in vivo administration of human rIL-2. In order to increase the GVL effects, spleen cells were incubated for 4 days with rIL-2 to generate IL-2-activated killer cells. The results of adoptive transfer experiments showed that only immunocompetent B6 cells led to consistent eradication of leukemia. Neither BALB nor syngeneic F1 cells induced curative GVL effects regardless of whether spleen cells were further stimulated with rIL-2 in vitro, in vivo, or both. Our data support the theory that GVL effects are caused by T cell-dependent immune responses of allogeneic T cells and not by MHC-nonrestricted NK or rIL-2-activated NK cells, independently of the GVHD process itself. Hence, recognition and killing of tumor cells is most probably a MHC-restricted T cell-dependent process.","['Cohen, P', 'Vourka-Karussis, U', 'Weiss, L', 'Slavin, S']","['Cohen P', 'Vourka-Karussis U', 'Weiss L', 'Slavin S']","['Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation, Hadassah University Hospital, Jerusalem, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (H-2 Antigens)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Graft vs Host Disease/immunology', 'H-2 Antigens/*immunology', '*Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Interleukin-2/*pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Lymphokine-Activated/immunology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology/therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",1993/11/01 00:00,1993/11/01 00:01,['1993/11/01 00:00'],"['1993/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1993 Nov 1;151(9):4803-10.,,,,,,,,,,

This enzyme exists in most of the human tissues and the activity is high in lymphatic tissues, especially in T lymphocytes. Elevated adenosine deaminase activity in T cell leukemia has been reported, and its inhibitor, deoxycoformycin, has been developed as an antitumor agent. In some types of leukemia, serum adenosine deaminase activity increases in accordance with the severity of the disease. Although mycosis fungoides rarely involves peripheral blood, tumor cells do invade the skin. In order to evaluate the clinical significance of adenosine deaminase in mycosis fungoides, adenosine deaminase activity was measured in sera of 15 patients with mycosis fungoides at various stages. The mean enzyme activity was 23.2 IU/l, which was high with statistical significance compared with healthy controls (P < 0.001). Nine of twelve patients in the plaque stage (T2N0M0, IB) showed higher adenosine deaminase activity than did the normal population. The mean adenosine deaminase activity in sera in the patients in the plaque stage (T2N0M0, IB) was as high as 19.0 IU/l (range 13.7-21.4) with statistical significance compared with healthy control (P < 0.001). Three tumor stage patients without visceral involvement (T3N0M0, IIB) showed higher levels of adenosine deaminase activity (19.7, 21.5, 24.4 IU/l). An erythrodermic patient (T4N0M0, III) also had a high adenosine deaminase activity 28.4 IU/l. Two tumor stage patients with organ involvement (T3N0M1, IVB) exhibited extremely high adenosine deaminase activity (60.9, 32.2 IU/l). The adenosine deaminase activity in sera showed a tendency to become higher with the extension of the stages.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Koizumi, H', 'Tomizawa, K', 'Tanaka, H', 'Kumakiri, M', 'Ohkawara, A']","['Koizumi H', 'Tomizawa K', 'Tanaka H', 'Kumakiri M', 'Ohkawara A']","['Department of Dermatology, Hokkaido University School of Medicine, Sapporo, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Dermatol,The Journal of dermatology,7600545,['EC 3.5.4.4 (Adenosine Deaminase)'],IM,"['Adenosine Deaminase/*blood', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Dermatitis, Exfoliative/blood/enzymology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mycosis Fungoides/blood/*enzymology/pathology', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Skin Neoplasms/blood/*enzymology/pathology']",1993/07/01 00:00,1993/07/01 00:01,['1993/07/01 00:00'],"['1993/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1346-8138.1993.tb01306.x [doi]'],ppublish,J Dermatol. 1993 Jul;20(7):394-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1346-8138.1993.tb01306.x.,,,,,,,,,,

Parent ratings showed inadequate external validity when compared with behavioral observations. Children with greater anxiety and higher subjective ratings subsequently exhibited more frequent episodes of emesis by observation, suggesting that their perceptions of symptoms based on previous chemotherapy experiences may predict emesis during different chemotherapy.

Earlier studies of the subcellular localization of transfected murine type IV c-Abl protein in fibroblasts have shown that this molecule resides largely in the nucleus, whereas transforming deletion variants are localized exclusively in the cytoplasm. Here, we demonstrate that the murine type IV c-Abl protein is also found in the nucleus when overexpressed in a mouse hematopoietic cell line. However, in both normal and leukemic human hematopoietic cells, c-Abl is discerned predominantly in the cytoplasm, with nuclear staining present, albeit at a lower level. In contrast, normal endogenous Bcr protein, as well as the aberrant p210BCR-ABL and p190BCR-ABL proteins consistently localize to the cytoplasm in both cell lines and fresh cells. The results with p210BCR-ABL were confirmed in a unique Ph1-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) cell line, KBM5, which lacks the normal chromosome 9 and hence the normal c-Abl product. Because the p210BCR-ABL protein appears cytoplasmic in both chronic phase and blast crisis CML cells, as does the p190BCR-ABL in Ph1-positive acute leukemia, a change in subcellular location of Bcr-Abl proteins between cytoplasm and nucleus cannot explain the different spectrum of leukemias associated with p210 and p190, nor the transition from the chronic to the acute leukemia phenotype seen in CML. Further analysis of fresh CML and normal hematopoietic bone marrow cells reveals that p210BCR-ABL, as well as the normal Bcr and Abl proteins, are expressed primarily in the early stages of myeloid maturation, and that levels of expression are reduced significantly as the cells mature to polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Similarly, a decrease in Bcr and Abl levels occurs in HL-60 cells induced by DMSO to undergo granulocytic differentiation. The action of p210BCR-ABL and its normal counterparts may, therefore, take place during the earlier stages of myeloid development.","['Wetzler, M', 'Talpaz, M', 'Van Etten, R A', 'Hirsh-Ginsberg, C', 'Beran, M', 'Kurzrock, R']","['Wetzler M', 'Talpaz M', 'Van Etten RA', 'Hirsh-Ginsberg C', 'Beran M', 'Kurzrock R']","['Department of Clinical Investigation, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (BCR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Bcr protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Blast Crisis', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Cell Differentiation', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA, Complementary', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/analysis/*biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry/methods', 'Leukemia/*metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/analysis/*biosynthesis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl/analysis/*biosynthesis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/10/01 00:00,1993/10/01 00:01,['1993/10/01 00:00'],"['1993/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1172/JCI116786 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1993 Oct;92(4):1925-39. doi: 10.1172/JCI116786.,,,,,PMC288359,,,,,

We now demonstrate that the addition of both Cer-1-phosphate (Cer-1-P) and a short-acyl chain analog of Cer-1-P,N-hexanoylsphingosine-1-phosphate (C6-Cer-1-P) to cultured cells and a variety of subcellular fractions results in rapid degradation to Cer and C6-Cer, respectively. The Cer-1-P phosphatase activity is enriched in a rat liver plasma membrane fraction and appears to be distinct from the phosphatase that hydrolyzes phosphatidic acid (PA), PA phosphohydrolase, as shown by the difference in sensitivity of Cer-1-P and PA hydrolysis to propranolol, detergent, and heat treatment. Moreover, the Km of Cer-1-P hydrolysis is 10-fold lower than the Km of PA hydrolysis in plasma membrane. PA is a noncompetitive inhibitor of Cer-1-P hydrolysis, with an inhibition constant 1-1.5-fold higher than the Km of Cer-1-P hydrolysis. In contrast, Cer-1-P does not inhibit PA hydrolysis. Finally, we describe the synthesis of a novel analog of Cer-1-P which is not hydrolyzed in vitro and in vivo and is internalized in cultured cells by endocytosis. These results are discussed in relation to the possible roles of Cer-1-P in regulating intracellular levels of Cer.","['Boudker, O', 'Futerman, A H']","['Boudker O', 'Futerman AH']","['Department of Membrane Research and Biophysics, Weizmann Institute of Science Rehovot, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Ceramides)', '0 (Lipids)', '0 (Phosphatidic Acids)', '0 (ceramide 1-phosphate)', 'EC 3.1.3.- (ceramide-1-phosphate phosphatase)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CHO Cells', 'Cell Membrane/enzymology', 'Ceramides/*metabolism', 'Cricetinae', 'Humans', 'Hydrolysis', 'Lipids/pharmacology', 'Liver/*enzymology', 'Phosphatidic Acids/metabolism', 'Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/10/15 00:00,1993/10/15 00:01,['1993/10/15 00:00'],"['1993/10/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/10/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/10/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(20)80660-7 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1993 Oct 15;268(29):22150-5.,,,,,,,,,,

We have purified several proteins binding to SEF1 sites from bovine thymus using a five-step purification procedure. The proteins migrated as 19 distinct bands representing molecular masses from 23 kDa to about 200 kDa in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Ten DNA binding proteins, with molecular masses between 23 and 67 kDa, could be isolated after separation by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The DNA binding specificities of these proteins were similar and corresponded to that of the SEF1 binding activity in nuclear extracts. Each of these isolated SEF1 proteins also bound to the essential delta-E3 element of the human T cell receptor delta enhancer. Antibodies against one SEF1 protein only reacted with the protein used for immunization, which indicates a limited homology between at least some SEF1 proteins. We also present data suggesting that SEF1 proteins exist in multiple forms with differences in their DNA binding specificity, and that high affinity DNA binding of the SEF1 proteins requires protein phosphorylation.","['Thornell, A', 'Holm, M', 'Grundstrom, T']","['Thornell A', 'Holm M', 'Grundstrom T']","['Department of Applied Cell and Molecular Biology, University of Umea, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'CD3 Complex/metabolism', 'Cattle', 'DNA/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*isolation & purification/metabolism', '*Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Neoplasm Proteins', 'Phosphorylation', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Thymus Gland/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*isolation & purification/metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic']",1993/10/15 00:00,1993/10/15 00:01,['1993/10/15 00:00'],"['1993/10/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/10/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/10/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(20)80632-2 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1993 Oct 15;268(29):21946-54.,,,,,,,,,,

The inhibition by antisense oligonucleotide ASGII was blocked when its sense complement, SGII, was included in the incubation mixture. Stably transfected P388D1 cells expressing an antisense construct for group II PLA2 also produced reduced quantities of PGE2 in response to LPS and PAF.

Tax does not bind these elements directly, but mediates transactivation through the cellular transcription factors that recognize a cAMP response element (CRE)-like sequence centered within each of the 21-bp repeats. In this report, we identify activating transcription factor-2 (ATF-2) and CRE-binding protein (CREB) as the principal T-cell proteins that bind the three 21-bp repeats in vitro. Purified Tax protein augments the level of RNA synthesis induced by ATF-2 and CREB in a cell-free transcription assay, providing evidence that Tax cooperates with these cellular proteins to activate HTLV-I transcription. Furthermore, Tax dramatically increases the binding of both the T-cell-derived and recombinant forms of ATF-2 and CREB to each of the 21-bp repeats. The target sequences for this enhancement reside within the DNA binding/dimerization domains of these proteins. These data suggest that Tax transactivates HTLV-I gene expression by increasing the number of bound ATF-2 and CREB molecules at the viral promoter.","['Franklin, A A', 'Kubik, M F', 'Uittenbogaard, M N', 'Brauweiler, A', 'Utaisincharoen, P', 'Matthews, M A', 'Dynan, W S', 'Hoeffler, J P', 'Nyborg, J K']","['Franklin AA', 'Kubik MF', 'Uittenbogaard MN', 'Brauweiler A', 'Utaisincharoen P', 'Matthews MA', 'Dynan WS', 'Hoeffler JP', 'Nyborg JK']","['Department of Biochemistry, Colorado State University, Fort Collins 80523.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (ATF2 protein, human)', '0 (Activating Transcription Factor 2)', '0 (Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Activating Transcription Factor 2', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatography, Affinity', 'Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein/*metabolism', 'Gene Products, tax/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism', '*Transcription Factors', '*Transcriptional Activation']",1993/10/05 00:00,1993/10/05 00:01,['1993/10/05 00:00'],"['1993/10/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/10/05 00:01 [medline]', '1993/10/05 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(19)36914-5 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1993 Oct 5;268(28):21225-31.,,,,,,,,['1 R55 CA55035/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,

The deduced amino acid sequence of this transporter is the same as MCAT-2 (mouse cationic amino acid transporter-2), the low affinity transporter expressed in hepatocytes, except for a stretch of 41 amino acids that connects the eighth and ninth membrane-spanning domains. These transporters apparently result from differential splicing of transcripts from a single gene and therefore have been named MCAT-2A (hepatocyte) and MCAT-2B (macrophage). Despite their similarity, MCAT-2B is saturated at one-fifth the arginine concentration, has a lower apparent Vmax, and is more sensitive to trans-stimulation than MCAT-2. Introduction of the unique regions of MCAT-2A and MCAT-2B into the equivalent portion of the related protein, MCAT-1, created chimeric transporters with properties most like the donor of this region. Our findings suggest these 41 amino acids contain a domain that binds the amino acid substrate during its translocation across the membrane.","['Closs, E I', 'Lyons, C R', 'Kelly, C', 'Cunningham, J M']","['Closs EI', 'Lyons CR', 'Kelly C', 'Cunningham JM']","[""Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts 02115.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cations)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (ecotropic murine leukemia virus receptor)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Biological Transport', 'Carrier Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Cations', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA, Complementary', 'Liver/metabolism', 'Macrophages/metabolism', '*Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Membrane Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Receptors, Virus', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Xenopus laevis']",1993/10/05 00:00,1993/10/05 00:01,['1993/10/05 00:00'],"['1993/10/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/10/05 00:01 [medline]', '1993/10/05 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(19)36854-1 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1993 Oct 5;268(28):20796-800.,,,"['MCAT-1', 'MCAT-2A', 'MCAT-2B']",,,,,['CA47075/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,

Luminol had a greater CL response than DALM with HL-60 promyelocytic stem cells and differentiated macrophage-like or neutrophil-like whole cell and cell lysate preparations. However, DALM showed markedly greater CL than luminol for membrane fractions derived from each cell type. The greatest luminol-dependent CL was observed for cell types high in myeloperoxidase (MPO). The greatest DALM-mediated CL was seen with cell types that are high in MPO or strong producers of superoxide (O2-) anions. In some cases, significant differences in CL could also be distinguished on the basis of inducing agent used [i.e. dimethylsulfoxide, all-trans retinoic acid or 12-o-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate]. Both luminol- and DALM-dependent CL were strongly inhibited by preincubation of cellular preparations with 3-amino-L-tyrosine (a component of DALM). Taken together, these data suggest that the reaction mechanism of luminol favors interaction with cytoplasmic MPO whereas that of DALM favors membrane interactions.

While c-myc is thought to be involved in DNA replication, its overexpression showed no effect on the expression of proliferating cell specific nuclear antigen or DNA polymerase a. The overexpression of c-myc repressed the expression of glycophorin, ALAS-E and beta-globin genes, of the five erythroid-specific genes, but had no effect on expression of GATA-1 or EpoR gene. These results suggest that c-Myc differentially regulates the expression of the latent period and erythroid-specific genes.","['Shoji, W', 'Ohmori, Y', 'Obinata, M']","['Shoji W', 'Ohmori Y', 'Obinata M']","['Department of Cell Biology, Tohoku University, Sendai.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Jpn J Cancer Res,Japanese journal of cancer research : Gann,8509412,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*physiology', 'Genes, myc/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Transcriptional Activation']",1993/08/01 00:00,1993/08/01 00:01,['1993/08/01 00:00'],"['1993/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1349-7006.1993.tb02062.x [doi]'],ppublish,Jpn J Cancer Res. 1993 Aug;84(8):885-92. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.1993.tb02062.x.,,,"['Id', 'MER5', 'Spi-1', 'hsc70']",,PMC5919267,,,,,

The uptake of 3H-vincristine was measured in all cell lines and in cholesterol-depleted and -reloaded L5178Y and VCR/P200 cells. The initial rate of drug entry in resistant cells was lower than that measured in the parental cell line and it decreased as the relative resistance increased. An increment of cholesterol content, characterized in resistant cells, was directly proportional to the relative resistance to vincristine. Cholesterol depletion in both sensitive and resistant cells resulted in an increase in the rate of vincristine uptake, which reverted to the respective basal levels when each cell line was cholesterol-reloaded. The rate of drug uptake was inversely correlated with the molar ratio of cholesterol to phospholipids. Although both VCR/P cell sublines, but not the sensitive parental cells, expressed the P-glycoprotein in their plasma membrane, there were no differences in drug efflux and retention between resistant and parental cells. These results indicate that cholesterol modulates the permeation of vincristine through the plasma membrane and strongly suggest that increased levels of cholesterol/phospholipid account for the lower drug accumulation and greater resistance in these multidrug-resistant cells.","['Pallares-Trujillo, J', 'Domenech, C', 'Grau-Oliete, M R', 'Rivera-Fillat, M P']","['Pallares-Trujillo J', 'Domenech C', 'Grau-Oliete MR', 'Rivera-Fillat MP']","['Depto.

Tumorigenesis was accelerated moderately, but nearly all the tumors were T lymphomas. The altered tumor type may reflect both the T-cell tropism of Moloney virus and the higher level of E mu-v-abl 40 expression found in T lymphocytes than in B lymphocytes. Insertion near the c-myc, N-myc or pim-I gene was observed in 42% of the induced tumors, indicating that each of these genes may collaborate with v-abl in lymphomagenesis.

In this study, we investigated the molecular basis for the adhesive interactions between lymphocytes and human gingival fibroblasts (HGF). Peripheral blood T lymphocytes (PBT) exhibited binding ability, but only when the calls were activated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). Among several human cell lines tested, PMA-stimulated Molt-4, a human T-cell leukaemia line, also displayed significant binding ability to HGF. In order to clarify the molecule(s) involved in this cell-cell interaction, a panel of monoclonal antibodies (mAb) was prepared to PMA-activated Molt-4 and one clone, 4-145, was selected on the basis of its ability to block the binding of PMA-activated Molt-4 to HGF. Moreover, 4-145 inhibited the binding of not only activated Molt-4 but also activated PBT and other cell types to HGF. Biochemical and flow cytometric analyses revealed that 4-145 probably recognizes the beta 1 chain of very late antigen (VLA) integrins. Blocking experiments using mAb specific for the alpha-chain of VLA integrins demonstrated the involvement of alpha 4 (VLA-4) and, to a lesser extent, alpha 5 (VLA-5) chains in the adhesive interactions between T cells and HGF. Despite the significant involvement of VLA integrins in the adhesive interaction between PBT and HGF, the binding of PBT to human dermal fibroblasts (HDF) was not abrogated by 4-145, suggesting that HGF and HDF differ in their requirement of VLA integrins for adhesion to activated PBT. Furthermore, the fact that vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), one of the ligands of VLA-4, was not detected on HGF by flow cytometry and anti-fibronectin (FN) Ab did not block the adhesive interaction to HGF suggests that not-yet-identified ligand(s) for VLA-4 might be present on HGF.","['Murakami, S', 'Saho, T', 'Shimabukuro, Y', 'Isoda, R', 'Miki, Y', 'Okada, H']","['Murakami S', 'Saho T', 'Shimabukuro Y', 'Isoda R', 'Miki Y', 'Okada H']","['Department of Periodontology and Endodontology, Osaka University Faculty of Dentistry, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Immunology,Immunology,0374672,"['0 (Ligands)', '0 (Receptors, Very Late Antigen)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Cell Adhesion/physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Fibroblasts/metabolism', 'Gingiva/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Ligands', 'Lymphocyte Activation/physiology', 'Receptors, Very Late Antigen/*physiology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/*metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/07/01 00:00,1993/07/01 00:01,['1993/07/01 00:00'],"['1993/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Immunology. 1993 Jul;79(3):425-33.,,,,,PMC1421971,,,,,

The present study was performed to evaluate the inhibitory effect of hairy cells (HCs) and a possible lack of hematopoietic growth factors on the number of autologous CPCs in vitro. In initial experiments the number of circulating BFU-E, CFU-GM and CFU-mix in HCL patients was found decreased. Monocytopenia but not the number of circulating HCs correlated to the degree of colony reduction in our patients. This pointed to a lack of colony stimulating factors (CSFs) in HCL. Actually, the growth of BFU-E, CFU-GM, and CFU-mix improved upon the addition of IL-3 and GM-CSF in HCL patients but not in healthy donors. To test the suppressive role of HCs in our assay system, cultures were performed after removal of autologous HCs. The results showed that in HC-depleted cultures the numbers of BFU-E, CFU-GM, and CFU-mix were significantly higher. This inhibitory effect of HCs could partially be neutralized by the addition of monoclonal antibodies against TNF-alpha. When the assays were performed with the removal of HCs and the addition of CSFs normal progenitor cell counts were detected in most patients. We conclude that HCs mediate the inhibition of colony growth in part by TNF-alpha. Monocytopenia is related with a deficiency of CSFs in this disease. The reduced colony growth in HCL, therefore, is due to both the inhibitory effects of HCs and the deficiency of CSFs. We suppose that the CPC-compartment is actually preserved in this disease.","['Gasche, C', 'Reinisch, W', 'Schwarzmeier, J D']","['Gasche C', 'Reinisch W', 'Schwarzmeier JD']","['Department of Internal Medicine I and IV, University of Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Hematol Oncol,Hematological oncology,8307268,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Bone Marrow/physiology', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/*deficiency', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/blood/complications/*physiopathology', 'Leukopenia/etiology/pathology', 'Monocytes/cytology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/physiology']",1993/03/01 00:00,1993/03/01 00:01,['1993/03/01 00:00'],"['1993/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/hon.2900110207 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematol Oncol. 1993 Mar-Apr;11(2):97-104. doi: 10.1002/hon.2900110207.,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of the study was to determine the oral bioavailability of high dose methylprednisolone and to establish whether this is a feasible and more convenient route of administration. The plasma pharmacokinetics were described by a one-compartment open model with peak plasma levels of 6.9 +/- 2.5 micrograms/ml. Total area under the plasma concentration versus time curve was similar by either route. Mean relative oral bioavailability was generally high (91 +/- 27 per cent). Retrospective analysis of 34 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), non-Hodgkin's and Hodgkin's lymphoma treated with high dose methylprednisolone showed 11 responses including two complete remissions among nine patients with CLL. There was significant improvement in platelet counts in thrombocytopenic patients and treatment was well tolerated and toxicity was relatively low. High dose methylprednisolone may therefore be a useful palliative treatment for hematological malignancies, particularly where marrow suppression is a problem.","['Patel, P M', 'Selby, P J', 'Graham, M A', 'Viner, C', 'Newell, D R', 'McElwain, T J']","['Patel PM', 'Selby PJ', 'Graham MA', 'Viner C', 'Newell DR', 'McElwain TJ']","['Section of Medicine, Royal Marsden Hospital, Sutton, Surrey, U.K.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",England,Hematol Oncol,Hematological oncology,8307268,"['35S93Y190K (Procarbazine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'X4W7ZR7023 (Methylprednisolone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)', 'VAMP protocol']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Biological Availability', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Hodgkin Disease/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Injections, Intravenous', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Methylprednisolone/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Middle Aged', 'Procarbazine/administration & dosage', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",1993/03/01 00:00,1993/03/01 00:01,['1993/03/01 00:00'],"['1993/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/hon.2900110206 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematol Oncol. 1993 Mar-Apr;11(2):89-96. doi: 10.1002/hon.2900110206.,,,,,,,,,,

To determine whether there might be an association between the actions of M-CSF and special phases of the cell cycle, we separated D3-treated cells into cycle-specific fractions by centrifugal elutriation. G1-enriched cells were mostly stimulated for growth progression with M-CSF. On the other hand, G2/M-enriched cells were significantly induced into monocytic differentiation. The cell percentage in the G2/M phase has clearly correlated with that of terminally differentiated cells by M-CSF.

We examined 191 patients (85 acute myeloid leukemia [AML], 48 acute lymphocytic leukemia [ALL], 32 chronic myeloid leukemia [CML], 17 SAA, and nine myelodysplastic syndrome [MDS]) who were in hematologic remission 6 months to 13 years after either curative chemotherapy (n = 69) or allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) (n = 122) by culturing their precursor cells from bone marrow (BM) (n = 548) and peripheral blood (PB) (n = 529) in methylcellulose. Thirty-six BM donors and 25 PB donors served as controls. BM colony-forming cell numbers were abnormally low in all patients (p < 0.002) irrespective of underlying disorder and type of treatment (chemotherapy or irradiation). These numbers did not normalize with time--colony-forming cells were still strongly reduced up to 10 years after therapy, whether or not the patient had received an allogeneic bone marrow graft (p < 0.002). We also compared patients who remained in stable hematologic remission with those who later relapsed (6 months to 2 years after treatment). BM colony-forming cell numbers were significantly lower in patients who subsequently relapsed (p = 0.004). In contrast to BM cultures, we found normal colony-forming capacity by PB precursors in all patients. We conclude that (1) after chemotherapy or BMT, colony-forming cell numbers of BM in culture are permanently reduced; (2) this defect is probably due to a dysfunction of the BM environment rather than to a numerical reduction of the precursor cell pool; and (3) very low colony-forming capacity may be related to relapse.","['Betticher, D C', 'Huxol, H', 'Muller, R', 'Speck, B', 'Nissen, C']","['Betticher DC', 'Huxol H', 'Muller R', 'Speck B', 'Nissen C']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Basel, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Anemia, Aplastic/drug therapy/*pathology/therapy', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Blood Cells/*pathology', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cell Count', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/pathology/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*pathology/therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/*pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/drug therapy/pathology/therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*pathology/therapy']",1993/11/01 00:00,1993/11/01 00:01,['1993/11/01 00:00'],"['1993/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1993 Nov;21(12):1517-21.,,,,,,,,,,

Expression of p210 BCR/ABL in murine interleukin-3 (IL-3)--dependent cell lines typically converts these cell lines to factor-independence by a non-autocrine mechanism. The IL-3 receptor is believed to function in part by activating a receptor-associated tyrosine kinase, leading to the hypothesis that p210 BCR/ABL may induce factor-independence of myeloid cells by constitutively phosphorylating some common signal-transducing proteins that normally would be phosphorylated on tyrosine residues in response to IL-3. p210 BCR/ABL subclones were constructed from an IL-3-dependent murine myeloid cell line, 32Dcl3, by transfection of a plasmid containing a full-length p210 BCR/ABL cDNA. Following transfection, the cells became completely factor-independent within 3 weeks. We examined the effects of p210 BCR/ABL and IL-3 on the pattern of tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins in 32Dcl3 cells using one- and two-dimensional antiphosphotyrosine immunoblotting. WEHI-3B conditioned media (WEHI-CM) was used as a source of IL-3. The introduction of p210 BCR/ABL results in constitutively increased levels of tyrosine phosphorylation of more than 20 new proteins, while WEHI-CM induced transient tyrosine phosphorylation of 6 to 10 new proteins. Using two-dimensional immunoblots to examine phosphoproteins, four categories could be identified: (1) proteins that are inducibly tyrosine phosphorylated in response to WEHI-CM in 32Dcl3 cells only, (2) proteins inducibly tyrosine phosphorylated by WEHI-CM only in p210 BCR/ABL+ cells, (3) proteins that are inducibly tyrosine phosphorylated in response to WEHI-CM in both 32Dcl3 cells and p210 BCR/ABL+ cells, and (4) proteins inducibly tyrosine phosphorylated in response to WEHI-CM and constitutively phosphorylated in the presence of p210 BCR/ABL. We have identified one of the proteins in category 4 as p42 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase (ERK2). Overall, however, we found that the signal transduction pathways of IL-3 and BCR/ABL are strikingly different, suggesting that most of the immediate substrates of the IL-3 receptor-activated tyrosine kinase and p210 BCR/ABL kinase are different. Convergence of signaling pathways at p42 MAP kinase is of interest since activation of this kinase has been linked to mitogenesis in many systems. Identification of the overlapping proteins of both IL-3 signal transduction in 32Dcl3 cells and p210 BCR/ABL+ cells may help explain the growth-promoting effects of this oncogene.","['Matulonis, U', 'Salgia, R', 'Okuda, K', 'Druker, B', 'Griffin, J D']","['Matulonis U', 'Salgia R', 'Okuda K', 'Druker B', 'Griffin JD']","['Division of Tumor Immunology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02115.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Interleukin-3)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism/*physiology', '*Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Line', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*physiology', 'Interleukin-3/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/physiology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism/physiology', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'Transfection']",1993/10/01 00:00,1993/10/01 00:01,['1993/10/01 00:00'],"['1993/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1993 Oct;21(11):1460-6.,,,,['Exp Hematol. 1993 Oct;21(11):1403-4.

Human bone marrow cells were preincubated for 3 days with MPA (100 ng/mL) and then exposed to sublethal doses of adriamycin; LD50 was significantly increased in MPA-preincubated cells (896 +/- 172 ng/mL) vs. control cells (162 +/- 37 ng/mL); this protective effect of MPA was shown to be more efficient against S-phase-specific drugs such as 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) than against non-phase-specific drugs such as cisplatin.

Using antibodies against the cytoplasmic tail of the immunoglobulin co-receptor beta (Ig beta) chain we find mu, but not mu delta 1 chains associated with Ig beta. Since a heterodimer of surface-labeled proteins was co-precipitated with mu we conclude that only wild-type mu is associated with the Ig alpha/Ig beta co-receptor on the surface of pre-B cell lines. Mutant mu delta 1 chains achieve their surface expression by utilizing a glycophospholipid anchor. In vivo analysis of transgenic mice expressing either mu or mu delta 1 transgenes revealed the expected ""normal"" B cell development in the case of wild-type mu transgenic lymphocytes, but a block in differentiation of mu delta 1 transgenic lymphocytes. The maturation block occurs at the developmental transition of pre-B lymphocytes from the CD43/S7+, CD45R/B220low stage to the CD43/S7-, B220low/high stage in which the majority of L chain gene rearrangements occur. These results, together with the observed inability of the mu delta 1 chains to signal activation of L chain gene joining and to associate Ig alpha/Ig beta in pre-B cell lines suggests that signals mediated by the protein complex composed to mu/Ig alpha/Ig beta are crucial during differentiation of pre-B lymphocytes.","['Iglesias, A', 'Nichogiannopoulou, A', 'Williams, G S', 'Flaswinkel, H', 'Kohler, G']","['Iglesias A', 'Nichogiannopoulou A', 'Williams GS', 'Flaswinkel H', 'Kohler G']","['Max Planck-Institut fur Immunobiologie, Freiburg, FRG.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD79 Antigens)', '0 (Cd79a protein, mouse)', '0 (Glycosylphosphatidylinositols)', '0 (Immunoglobulin mu-Chains)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)']",IM,"['Abelson murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology/*immunology', 'CD79 Antigens', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Glycosylphosphatidylinositols/metabolism', 'Hybridomas/immunology', 'Immunoglobulin mu-Chains/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Mutation', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/immunology']",1993/10/01 00:00,2000/03/15 09:00,['1993/10/01 00:00'],"['1993/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/15 09:00 [medline]', '1993/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/eji.1830231036 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 1993 Oct;23(10):2622-30. doi: 10.1002/eji.1830231036.,,,,,,,,,,

In both human K562 myelogenous leukemia and rat PC12 pheochromocytoma cells, activin treatment caused transient transcription-dependent and protein synthesis-independent increases of junB messenger RNA (mRNA) within 1 h, whereas neither c-jun nor c-fos mRNA were inducible. In K562 cells, this selective junB mRNA induction was synergistically augmented by treatment with 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate but not affected by forskolin. Furthermore, in PC12 cells, the up-regulation of junB mRNA by activin was observable even after high-dose treatment with 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate for 48 h, indicating that junB mRNA expression by activin is independent of both A- and C-kinases.

Treatment of HL-60, K562, THP-1, and U937 cells with PMA resulted in an induction of urokinase-type PA (u-PA), the u-PA receptor (u-PAR), and PAI types 1 and 2 (PAI-1 and PAI-2). The addition of RA alone failed to alter gene expression or antigen production of PAI-1, PAI-2, or u-PAR. However, RA potentiated PMA-mediated induction of PAI-2 mRNA in HL-60 and U937 cells and PAI-2 antigen in all four cell lines. The effect of PMA on u-PA mRNA was also potentiated by RA in HL-60 and U937 cells. A similar, but transient, effect was seen on u-PA antigen levels. Run-on transcription analysis confirmed that these effects were due at least in part to changes in gene template activity. Furthermore, RA did not potentiate the effects of PMA on either u-PAR or PAI-1. In fact, in U937 cells, RA inhibited PMA-induced PAI-1 antigen secretion by approximately 60%. It would seem that interactive regulation of these genes allows for greater diversity of control, which may, in turn, be required for localized control of plasminogen-dependent extracellular proteolysis generated by monocytes/macrophage during cell migration and tissue remodeling.","['Schuster, W A', 'Medcalf, R L', 'Kruithof, E K']","['Schuster WA', 'Medcalf RL', 'Kruithof EK']","['Hematology Division, University Hospital, Lausanne, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Endocrinology,Endocrinology,0375040,"['0 (PLAUR protein, human)', '0 (Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor 2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Urokinase Plasminogen Activator)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Plasminogen Activators)', 'EC 3.4.21.73 (Urokinase-Type Plasminogen Activator)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Induction', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism/pathology', 'Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor 2/genetics/*metabolism', 'Plasminogen Activators/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/drug effects/metabolism', 'Receptors, Urokinase Plasminogen Activator', 'Templates, Genetic', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Urokinase-Type Plasminogen Activator/genetics/*metabolism']",1993/10/01 00:00,1993/10/01 00:01,['1993/10/01 00:00'],"['1993/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1210/endo.133.4.8404615 [doi]'],ppublish,Endocrinology. 1993 Oct;133(4):1724-30. doi: 10.1210/endo.133.4.8404615.,,,,,,,,,,

Cell Biol. 108, 1935-1943, 1989). We have called this oligospecific receptor the leukocyte response integrin (LRI). Engagement of LRI leads to both increased ingestion via PMN IgG Fc receptors and to adhesion and chemotaxis to certain extracellular matrix proteins. Now, we have purified an RGD-binding receptor from DMSO-differentiated HL-60 cells (dHL-60) by peptide affinity chromatography which has the biochemical, immunologic, and functional characteristics of LRI. The purified protein contains two bands of 135 and 90 kDa under nonreducing conditions SDS-PAGE. Immunologic characterization of the dHL-60 RGD receptor showed that, by Western blot and ELISA, the lower M(r) band was recognized by mAb 7G2, raised against placental beta 3, which is known to inhibit LRI function. However, despite this functional and immunologic cross-reactivity with beta 3, the receptor was not recognized efficiently by a polyclonal antibody to placental RGD-binding proteins, predominantly alpha v beta 3. Moreover, polyclonal antibody raised to the dHL-60 receptor (Ab1) did not react with placental RGD-binding proteins. By immunoprecipitation or ELISA, we demonstrated that the purified RGD-binding receptor was not alpha IIb beta 3 or alpha v beta 3 and did not contain the integrin chains alpha 4, beta 2, or beta 7. Functionally, Ab1 totally inhibited Fn-stimulated ingestion by PMN. Moreover, Ab1 inhibited phagocytosis stimulated by the peptide KGAGDV, which is the most specific ligand for LRI currently known, and Ab1 inhibited the binding of KGAGDV-coated microspheres to PMN and monocytes. FACS analysis with Ab1 showed staining of monocytes, PMN, and lymphocytes but not platelets or erythrocytes. We conclude that LRI is a novel RGD-binding receptor which exists on leukocytes and which shares an antigenic epitope(s) with beta 3. This receptor recognizes multiple RGD-containing ligands and can mediate signal transduction for adhesion, chemotaxis, and activation of increased phagocytic potential by PMN and monocytes.","['Carreno, M P', 'Gresham, H D', 'Brown, E J']","['Carreno MP', 'Gresham HD', 'Brown EJ']","['INSERM U28, Hopital Broussais, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Clin Immunol Immunopathol,Clinical immunology and immunopathology,0356637,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Extracellular Matrix Proteins)', '0 (Integrins)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Peptide)', '0 (arginyl-glycyl-aspartic acid directed cell adhesion receptor)', '0 (integrin, leukocyte response)', '78VO7F77PN (arginyl-glycyl-aspartic acid)', '9012-36-6 (Sepharose)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antibodies', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Blood Cells/immunology', 'Extracellular Matrix Proteins/physiology', 'Humans', 'Integrins/*isolation & purification/metabolism/physiology', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/blood/immunology/pathology', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neutrophils/chemistry', 'Oligopeptides/metabolism', 'Phagocytes/*physiology', 'Phagocytosis/*physiology', 'Protein Binding/drug effects', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*isolation & purification/metabolism/physiology', 'Receptors, Peptide/*isolation & purification/metabolism/physiology', 'Sepharose']",1993/10/01 00:00,1993/10/01 00:01,['1993/10/01 00:00'],"['1993/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0090122983711487 [pii]', '10.1006/clin.1993.1148 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Immunol Immunopathol. 1993 Oct;69(1):43-51. doi: 10.1006/clin.1993.1148.,,,,,,,,"['AI23790/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI24674/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'GM38330/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,

DC were co-cultured with an HTLV-1-producing cell line (MT-2) at 1:1 or 10:1 ratios. These DC stimulated high levels of proliferation in autologous T cells. This was similar to that seen in an autologous mixed leucocyte reaction (AMLR) using cells from TSP patients. The requirement for both DC and virus was confirmed, since neither DC co-cultured with uninfected MT-2 cells nor addition of infected MT-2 cells directly to T cells caused significant stimulation. DC exposed to the highest dose of HTLV-1 (1:1) for 24 h before addition of T cells caused strong stimulation that increased after 8 h but almost disappeared by 72 h. In situ hybridization showed that approximately 25% of DC became infected in cultured cells after preincubation for 24 h, and over 50% were infected with a 72-h preincubation. We suggest that infection of DC by HTLV-1 may be an initial step in altering the immune system in seronegative patients, and that persistent T cell stimulation in those with genetic susceptibility may underlie the production of neurological disease.","['Ali, A', 'Patterson, S', 'Cruickshank, K', 'Rudge, P', 'Dalgleish, A G', 'Knight, S C']","['Ali A', 'Patterson S', 'Cruickshank K', 'Rudge P', 'Dalgleish AG', 'Knight SC']","['Clinical Research Centre, Northwick Park Hospital, Harrow, Middlesex, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Clin Exp Immunol,Clinical and experimental immunology,0057202,,IM,"['Aged', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dendritic Cells/*immunology/microbiology', 'Female', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*immunology', 'Humans', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphocyte Culture Test, Mixed', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Paraparesis, Tropical Spastic/*immunology']",1993/10/01 00:00,1993/10/01 00:01,['1993/10/01 00:00'],"['1993/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2249.1993.tb05973.x [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Exp Immunol. 1993 Oct;94(1):32-7. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2249.1993.tb05973.x.,,,,,PMC1534377,,,,,

QM also inhibited the binding of OTF-1 to the AT-rich octamer present in the H2B promoter whereas HN2 was inactive. Inhibition of the binding of transcription factors was due to the drug interaction with DNA, since it also occurred when transcription factors were added to DNA after removal of free drug. In Jurkat cells transfected with pI3CAT, where the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene is under the control of the HIV LTR, both HN2 and QM inhibited CAT gene expression. However, in Jurkat cells transfected with plasmid -147, where the CAT gene is under the control of the H2B promoter, QM inhibited CAT expression but HN2 did not. These results were obtained at concentrations of HN2 or QM that inhibited total DNA and RNA synthesis to a similar extent. The present results suggest that the more selective pharmacological activity of HN2 (HN2 is an active antineoplastic agent whereas QM is inactive and very toxic) might be related to its preferential functional inhibition of GC-rich consensus sequence, possibly important in the regulation of genes involved in the malignant proliferation and behavior of some tumors.","['Fabbri, S', 'Prontera, C', 'Broggini, M', ""D'Incalci, M""]","['Fabbri S', 'Prontera C', 'Broggini M', ""D'Incalci M""]","['Laboratory of Cancer Chemotherapy, Istituto di Ricerche Farmacologiche Mario Negri, Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Carcinogenesis,Carcinogenesis,8008055,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (HCFC1 protein, human)', '0 (Host Cell Factor C1)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Octamer Transcription Factor-1)', '0 (Oligonucleotide Probes)', '0 (POU2F1 protein, human)', '0 (Phytohemagglutinins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '4213-45-0 (Quinacrine Mustard)', '50D9XSG0VR (Mechlorethamine)', 'EC 2.3.1.28 (Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['*Base Composition', 'Base Sequence', 'Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase/genetics/*metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', '*HIV Long Terminal Repeat', 'Host Cell Factor C1', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics', 'Mechlorethamine/*pharmacology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Octamer Transcription Factor-1', 'Oligonucleotide Probes/chemistry', 'Phytohemagglutinins/pharmacology', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Quinacrine Mustard/*pharmacology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/09/01 00:00,1993/09/01 00:01,['1993/09/01 00:00'],"['1993/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/carcin/14.9.1963 [doi]'],ppublish,Carcinogenesis. 1993 Sep;14(9):1963-7. doi: 10.1093/carcin/14.9.1963.,,,,,,,,,,

Linear production of [13C6]1,4-BQ adducts was observed with both Hb and bone-marrow proteins over the entire range of dosages of 0-400 mg/kg. The slopes of the regressions were 3.4 x 10(-4) (r2 = 0.997) and 1.6 x 10(-3) (r3 = 0.926) nmol/g protein/mg/kg respectively, for Hb and bone-marrow proteins. Production of [13C6]1,2-BQ adducts of Hb and bone-marrow proteins also increased with benzene dosage. Although the shapes of the relationships between 1,2-BQ adducts and dosage were nonlinear, the levels were approximately 10 times greater than those associated with 1,4-BQ, suggesting a significantly greater benzene-specific dose of 1,2-BQ. Adducts of 4,4'-diphenoquinone were not detected. High background levels of [12C6]adducts of 1,2-BQ and 1,4-BQ were found in Hb and bone-marrow proteins as might be expected from the many dietary sources of the phenolic precursors of the benzoquinones, i.e. phenol, catechol and hydroquinone. Background levels of the 1,2-BQ and 1,4-BQ adducts were 27.3 and 11.5 nmol/g in Hb and 44.6 and 25.6 nmol/g in the bone-marrow proteins respectively.

If the genotoxicity of benzene is, indeed, related to the in vivo production of BQ isomers, our results suggest that very large exposures to benzene would be needed to produce detectable increases in adduct levels and the associated risks of leukemia.","['McDonald, T A', 'Waidyanatha, S', 'Rappaport, S M']","['McDonald TA', 'Waidyanatha S', 'Rappaport SM']","['Department of Environmental Sciences and Engineering, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill 27599.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Carcinogenesis,Carcinogenesis,8008055,"['0 (Benzoquinones)', '0 (Proteins)', '3T006GV98U (quinone)', '9034-51-9 (Hemoglobin A)', 'SVD1LJ47R7 (2-benzoquinone)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Benzoquinones/*metabolism', 'Bone Marrow/*metabolism', 'Hemoglobin A/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Proteins/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred F344']",1993/09/01 00:00,1993/09/01 00:01,['1993/09/01 00:00'],"['1993/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/carcin/14.9.1921 [doi]'],ppublish,Carcinogenesis. 1993 Sep;14(9):1921-5. doi: 10.1093/carcin/14.9.1921.,,,,,,,,"['P42ES04705/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'P42ES05948/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']",,

It has been proposed that the cleavable complex is an unusual form of DNA damage that elicits cellular responses analogous to those caused by DNA damaging agents. The relationship between topoisomerase-targeting drug-induced damage and radiation-induced damage has been investigated by analyzing the properties of DNA topoisomerases in mouse L5178Y lymphoma strains that are cross-sensitive to topoisomerase I-II inhibitors and to UV light or X-ray irradiation. The strains are LY-R, isolated from L5178Y cells on the basis of increased resistance to ionizing radiation, and strain LY-S, isolated from LY-R cells following a spontaneous increase in the sensitivity to ionizing radiation. LY-S cells, deficient in the rejoining of DNA double-strand breaks, show enhanced sensitivity to topoisomerase II-targeting inhibitors, whereas LY-R cells have an increased sensitivity to UV radiation and to the topoisomerase I inhibitor, camptothecin. The cellular availability of DNA topoisomerase I and II and the sensitivity of the enzymes to their specific inhibitors have been measured in the two related strains. In the LY-R strain, we found a 30% decrease in topoisomerase I content but no difference in camptothecin sensitivity, while no quantitative or qualitative differences were observed for the topoisomerase II. The results indicate that variations in sensitivity of the L5178Y strains to topoisomerase inhibitors are unlikely to be related to primary defects of the target enzymes, and thus it is possible that common pathways exist for processing of topoisomerase- and radiation-induced damage.","['Lanza, A', 'Tornaletti, S', 'Stefanini, M', 'Evans, H H', 'Ricanati, M', 'Astaldi Ricotti, G C', 'Pedrini, A M']","['Lanza A', 'Tornaletti S', 'Stefanini M', 'Evans HH', 'Ricanati M', 'Astaldi Ricotti GC', 'Pedrini AM']","['Istituto di Genetica Biochimica ed Evoluzionistica del CNR, Pavia, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Carcinogenesis,Carcinogenesis,8008055,"['0 (DNA, Superhelical)', '0 (Topoisomerase I Inhibitors)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '00DPD30SOY (Amsacrine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EC 5.99.1.2 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type I)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)', 'XT3Z54Z28A (Camptothecin)']",IM,"['Amsacrine/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Camptothecin/*pharmacology', '*DNA Damage', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type I/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'DNA, Superhelical/*drug effects', 'Etoposide/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia L5178/drug therapy/*enzymology', 'Mice', 'Topoisomerase I Inhibitors', 'Topoisomerase II Inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/09/01 00:00,1993/09/01 00:01,['1993/09/01 00:00'],"['1993/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/carcin/14.9.1759 [doi]'],ppublish,Carcinogenesis. 1993 Sep;14(9):1759-63. doi: 10.1093/carcin/14.9.1759.,,,,,,,,['CA 15901/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,

Sequences within the first exon of BCR are required to activate the transforming potential of BCR-ABL. The SH2/SH3 domain-containing GRB-2 protein links tyrosine kinases to Ras signaling. We demonstrate that BCR-ABL exists in a complex with GRB-2 in vivo. Binding of GRB-2 to BCR-ABL is mediated by the direct interaction of the GRB-2 SH2 domain with a phosphorylated tyrosine, Y177, within the BCR first exon. The BCR-ABL-GRB-2 interaction is required for activation of the Ras signaling pathway. Mutation of Y177 to phenylalanine (Y177F) abolishes GRB-2 binding and abrogates BCR-ABL-induced Ras activation. The BCR-ABL (Y177F) mutant is unable to transform primary bone marrow cultures and is impaired in its ability to transform Rat1 fibroblasts. These findings implicate activation of Ras function as an important component in BCR-ABL-mediated transformation and demonstrate that GRB-2 not only functions in normal development and mitogenesis but also plays a role in oncogenesis.","['Pendergast, A M', 'Quilliam, L A', 'Cripe, L D', 'Bassing, C H', 'Dai, Z', 'Li, N', 'Batzer, A', 'Rabun, K M', 'Der, C J', 'Schlessinger, J']","['Pendergast AM', 'Quilliam LA', 'Cripe LD', 'Bassing CH', 'Dai Z', 'Li N', 'Batzer A', 'Rabun KM', 'Der CJ', 'Schlessinger J', 'et al.']","['Department of Pharmacology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina 27710.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cell,Cell,0413066,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (GRB2 Adaptor Protein)', '0 (GRB2 protein, human)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '47E5O17Y3R (Phenylalanine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (BCR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr)']",IM,"['*Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Exons', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*metabolism', 'GRB2 Adaptor Protein', 'Genes, abl', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive', 'Moths', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', '*Phenylalanine', '*Point Mutation', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/10/08 00:00,1993/10/08 00:01,['1993/10/08 00:00'],"['1993/10/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/10/08 00:01 [medline]', '1993/10/08 00:00 [entrez]']",['0092-8674(93)90689-N [pii]'],ppublish,Cell. 1993 Oct 8;75(1):175-85.,,,,,,,,"['CA42978/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK01965/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'GM07184/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,

Little is known about the regulation of its expression. The human promyelocytic leukemia cell line, HL-60, was used to determine whether expression of hL-31 (Mac-2) correlated with macrophage/monocyte differentiation. Nondifferentiated HL-60 cells and HL-60 cells grown in the presence of 1.24 microM retinoic acid expressed only trace amounts of hL-31. In contrast, both hL-31 transcripts and protein were detected at 8 h after addition of 17 nM 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate and reached maximal levels at 24 h. Addition of actinomycin D along with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate blocked accumulation of hL-31 mRNA. In contrast, addition of actinomycin D to 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-treated HL-60 cells that had already accumulated high levels of hL-31 mRNA did not cause significant reduction in RNA levels until 6-8 h had elapsed. Since increased hL-31 expression was not associated with an increase in transcriptional activity of the hL-31 gene, these results suggest that hL-31 expression is regulated at the posttranscriptional level, at least in part, by stabilization of its mRNA. The results also indicate that the processes leading to increased hL-31 expression in HL-60 cells may be specific to differentiation along the monocyte/macrophage pathway.","['Nangia-Makker, P', 'Ochieng, J', 'Christman, J K', 'Raz, A']","['Nangia-Makker P', 'Ochieng J', 'Christman JK', 'Raz A']","['Metastasis Research Program, Michigan Cancer Foundation, Detroit 48201.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Galactosides)', '0 (Galectins)', '0 (Hemagglutinins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Actins/biosynthesis', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Dactinomycin/pharmacology', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Galactosides/metabolism', 'Galectins', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Hemagglutinins/analysis/*biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Monocytes/cytology/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/drug effects/metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/10/15 00:00,1993/10/15 00:01,['1993/10/15 00:00'],"['1993/10/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/10/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/10/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1993 Oct 15;53(20):5033-7.,,,,,,,,"['CA51714-042S1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA46120/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA50909/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,

Twenty-seven studies were performed in children aged < 10 years. Repeat studies were performed in 11 patients. Median pharmacokinetic parameters were as follows: plasma clearance, 26 ml/min/m2; volume of distribution, 4.9 liters/m2; area under the etoposide plasma concentration-time curve (AUC), 3.9 mg/ml x min per 100 mg/m2. Interindividual variability in pharmacokinetic parameters was large (coefficient of variation (CV) = 30, 28, and 27%, respectively) in comparison with intraindividual variability (CV = 12, 14, and 12%, respectively). Variability in AUC was much greater in those patients treated with 150-200 mg/m2 etoposide than with 100 mg/m2 (CV, 35 versus 13%) and was related to variability in renal function and prior exposure to cisplatin. Data from the first 20 studies were used to develop pharmacokinetic monitoring equations which were validated in a further 13 patients. The most accurate equation relies upon the elimination constant of 51Cr-EDTA and a single blood specimen taken at the end of the etoposide infusion. [formula: see text] where K = 51Cr-EDTA elimination rate constant. This equation showed no significant bias, and the predictive error was small with respect to AUC calculated according to a two-compartment model. Predictive error did not increase with increasing AUC, whereas a marked increase in predictive error was seen for dosing according to body surface area. Dosing according to body surface area alone led to marked over- or underexposure to etoposide in 8 patients. Pharmacokinetic monitoring using the equation described would have identified these patients and permitted dose modification. This approach provides an accurate means of monitoring etoposide AUC for administration times of 1-4 h without the need for detailed pharmacokinetic sampling. It will allow a significant reduction in the variability of exposure seen with surface area-based dosing.","['Lowis, S P', 'Pearson, A D', 'Newell, D R', 'Cole, M']","['Lowis SP', 'Pearson AD', 'Newell DR', 'Cole M']","['Department of Child Health, University of Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,['6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Brain Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Etoposide/blood/*pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Metabolic Clearance Rate', 'Neoplasms/blood/*drug therapy', 'Neuroblastoma/drug therapy', 'Pineal Gland', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Sarcoma/drug therapy', 'Soft Tissue Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Teratoma/drug therapy']",1993/10/15 00:00,1993/10/15 00:01,['1993/10/15 00:00'],"['1993/10/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/10/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/10/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1993 Oct 15;53(20):4881-9.,,,,,,,,,,

In 8 cell lines, 2 or more of the 9p loci examined were found to be homozygously lost; 2 others displayed homozygous losses only at the D9S171 locus. Results from our deletion mapping analysis suggest that D9S171 is located between IFNA/IFNW and D9S126. The data presented here indicate that allelic loss from 9p21-p22 is a common occurrence in MM and further delineate the location of a putative 9p tumor suppressor gene(s) to a region between IFNA/IFNW and D9S171.

Although IL-2 and/or IL-4 enhanced the cell proliferation of freshly isolated ATL cells from seven of nine patients, IL-2 did not affect the IL-6 release in most cases. In contrast, another T-cell tropic factor, IL-4 markedly inhibited the release of IL-6 in the conditioned medium in all cases. This IL-4-mediated inhibition of IL-6 release was completely abrogated by the addition of anti-IL-4 monoclonal antibody. Time course experiments demonstrated that IL-4 reduced the secretion of IL-6 for a prolonged period of time (more than 72 h). By Northern analysis, IL-4 reduced the transcription level of IL-6 mRNA. Furthermore, by flow cytofluorometry with the use of anti-human IL-4 receptor monoclonal antibody, ATL cells showed the significant level of IL-4 receptor on their cell surfaces without any stimulation.

In contrast, however, the cytotoxic and cytostatic activity of aromatic, DNA-intercalating, DNA topoisomerase II inhibitors such as Adriamycin, ellipticine, or mitoxantrone are diminished in the presence of CAF. To resolve whether the protective effect of CAF is associated with a particular mechanism of drug interaction (e.g., intercalation into DNA, inhibition of DNA topoisomerase II), or the aromatic nature of the drug structure, per se, we have presently studied the effects of CAF on the cytostatic and cytotoxic action of camptothecin (CAM) and its less toxic but more water soluble derivative topotecan (TPT) on HL-60 human myelogenous leukemia cells: both drugs have aromatic structures but are nonintercalating inhibitors of DNA topoisomerase I. By using spectroscopy and titration microcalorimetry, we have also studied the direct interaction between CAF and TPT in solution. Low (20 nM) concentrations of CAM or TPT perturbed progression of HL-60 cells through S-phase, whereas higher concentrations (0.15 microM) of these drugs induced apoptosis; both effects were easily demonstrable after 4 h of treatment. When added simultaneously with CAM or TPT, CAF prevented both effects. The protective effect of CAF was concentration dependent and evident within the concentration range of 1-5 mM; nearly total protection was seen at a CAF concentration of 5 mM. The bathochromic and hypochromic shift in the absorption spectrum of the water soluble compound TPT upon addition of CAF indicated that CAF and TPT interact (stack) in a fashion similar to that previously observed for CAF and DNA intercalators. Microcalorimetric measurements of TPT titration with CAF indicate an exothermic reaction between these compounds (the enthalpy change was delta H degree = -4.2 kcal/mol), which is consistent with a stacking model of CAF-TPT interaction. Thus, the ability of CAF to protect HL-60 cells against the cell kinetic effects of CAM or TPT, as in the case of DNA intercalating topoisomerase II inhibitors, is most likely due to formation of complexes between CAF and these aromatic molecules, which result in reducing the effective concentration of the free form of these drugs available to the cells.","['Traganos, F', 'Kapuscinski, J', 'Gong, J', 'Ardelt, B', 'Darzynkiewicz, R J', 'Darzynkiewicz, Z']","['Traganos F', 'Kapuscinski J', 'Gong J', 'Ardelt B', 'Darzynkiewicz RJ', 'Darzynkiewicz Z']","['Cancer Research Institute, New York Medical College, Valhalla 10595.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '3G6A5W338E (Caffeine)', '7M7YKX2N15 (Topotecan)', 'XT3Z54Z28A (Camptothecin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*toxicity', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caffeine/*pharmacology', 'Camptothecin/*analogs & derivatives/antagonists & inhibitors/*toxicity', 'Cell Cycle/*drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Topotecan', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/10/01 00:00,1993/10/01 00:01,['1993/10/01 00:00'],"['1993/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1993 Oct 1;53(19):4613-8.,,,,,,,,['CA 28704/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,

It is eliminated from organs and blood with a half-time of approximately 2.7 h. It is well absorbed after p.o. administration. In mice implanted i.p. with the MDR P388/Dox tumor, a single i.v. or p.o. dose of GF120918 restores sensitivity of the tumor to a single i.p. dose (5 mg/kg) of doxorubicin administered 1 h later. A statistically significant effect is observed at 1 mg/kg GF120918 i.v. and maximal effect is reached at 5 mg/kg. Similarly, whereas neither drug alone is effective, GF120918 (10 mg/kg i.p.) associated with doxorubicin (5 mg/kg i.p.) inhibits the growth of the moderately MDR C26 tumor implanted s.c. as assessed by tumor size at day 19. GF120918 does not modify significantly the distribution or the elimination of doxorubicin in mice ruling out the possibility that the antitumor effects seen might be explained by pharmacokinetic interactions.","['Hyafil, F', 'Vergely, C', 'Du Vignaud, P', 'Grand-Perret, T']","['Hyafil F', 'Vergely C', 'Du Vignaud P', 'Grand-Perret T']","['Laboratoires GLAXO, Centre de Recherches, Les Ulis, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Acridines)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Isoquinolines)', '0 (Tetrahydroisoquinolines)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'N488540F94 (Elacridar)']",IM,"['Acridines/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*toxicity', 'Breast Neoplasms', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Colonic Neoplasms', 'Cricetinae', 'Cricetulus', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Doxorubicin/*toxicity', '*Drug Resistance', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Isoquinolines/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia P388', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Ovary', '*Tetrahydroisoquinolines', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/10/01 00:00,1993/10/01 00:01,['1993/10/01 00:00'],"['1993/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1993 Oct 1;53(19):4595-602.,,,,,,,,,,

L1210 cells, sensitive to cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II) (CDDP) and tetraplatin (L1210/0), 160-fold resistant to CDDP [L1210/diamminedichloroplatinum (DDP)], or 70-fold resistant to tetraplatin (L1210/DACH), were used in conjunction with compounds having the general structure DACH-Pt(IV)-X2Y2, where X and Y are axial and equatorial ligands and X2Y2 are specifically Cl2Cl2,Ac2Cl2, (TFA)2Cl2, (OH)2Cl2, and Cl2CBDCA (Cl, chloro; Ac, acetato; TFA, trifluoroacetato; OH, hydroxo; CBDCA, 1,1-cyclobutanedicarboxylato). Comparison of cytotoxicities between isomers of Cl2Cl2,Ac2Cl2, or Cl2CBDCA indicated that R,R-isomers were the most effective against all three cell lines. The relatively lower activity of the S,S- and cis-isomers was cell line dependent: against L1210/DACH, both isomers of Cl2Cl2 were only 2- to 3-fold less effective, and this contrasted with 7- and 26-fold lower cytotoxicities, respectively, against L1210/DDP. Cross-resistance factors in the L1210/DDP and L1210/DACH lines depended on both isomeric form and the nature of axial or equatorial ligand. The L1210/DDP cells were 6- to 9-fold cross-resistant to the R,R-isomer, 8- to 15-fold to S,S-isomer, and 13- to 38-fold to cis-isomer. The L1210/DACH line was only 4- to 7-fold cross-resistant to the three isomers of Ac2Cl2 but cross-resistance to the isomers was 47- to 79-fold for Cl2Cl2 and 22- to 56-fold for Cl2CBDCA complexes. Compared with CDDP, accumulation (2 h at 100 microM drug concentration) of Ac2Cl2 in the three L1210 cell lines was 26-50%, while uptake of Cl2Cl2 and (TFA)2Cl2 was 100-170% and 320-570%, respectively. The greatest DNA binding was seen with Cl2Cl2 in all cell lines, followed by (TFA)2Cl2, CDDP, and Ac2Cl2. DNA binding correlated directly with potency (1/concentration producing 50% inhibition) in the L1210/0 model (r = 0.973, P < 0.016) but not in the L1210/DDP and L1210/DACH models. Accumulation and DNA-binding studies indicated that binding efficiency to DNA was: Cl2Cl2 > Ac2Cl2 > CDDP > (TFA)2Cl2. In a nonreducing environment, the Pt(IV) complexes (20 microM) did not react with salmon sperm DNA. Reduced glutathione (100 microM), as a reducing agent, rendered full binding capacity to Cl2Cl2; binding was 25-30% of the expected maximum for (TFA)2Cl2, while Ac2Cl2 remained inert.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Kido, Y', 'Khokhar, A R', 'al-Baker, S', 'Siddik, Z H']","['Kido Y', 'Khokhar AR', 'al-Baker S', 'Siddik ZH']","['Department of Clinical Investigations, University of Texas M.

The breakpoints on the two chromosomes occurred within introns of the involved genes: AF-9 on chromosome 9, and ALL-1 on chromosome 11. Sequence analysis identified heptamers flanking the breakpoints on both chromosomes 9 and 11, suggesting that the V-D-J recombinase was involved in the translocation. The presence of an N-region between the two chromosomes supports the hypothesis that a mistake in V-D-J joining was involved in the genesis of the translocation and indicates that terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase was expressed in the cells from which this acute myeloid leukemia originated. In addition, potential topoisomerase II DNA-binding sites were found near the breakpoints of both chromosomes, suggesting the involvement of altered topoisomerase II activity in this translocation. Altered topoisomerase II activity in the presence of an active V-D-J recombinase may be a pathogenetic mechanism of acute myeloid leukemia with rearrangements at 11q23.","['Negrini, M', 'Felix, C A', 'Martin, C', 'Lange, B J', 'Nakamura, T', 'Canaani, E', 'Croce, C M']","['Negrini M', 'Felix CA', 'Martin C', 'Lange BJ', 'Nakamura T', 'Canaani E', 'Croce CM']","['Jefferson Cancer Institute, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19107.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (DNA Nucleotidyltransferases)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (VDJ Recombinases)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9', 'DNA Nucleotidyltransferases/metabolism', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/*metabolism', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Introns', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'VDJ Recombinases']",1993/10/01 00:00,1993/10/01 00:01,['1993/10/01 00:00'],"['1993/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1993 Oct 1;53(19):4489-92.,,,"['AF-9', 'ALL-1']",,,,,['CA39860/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,

METHODS: To assess the risk for childhood malignancy in NF1, 26,084 patients with cancer younger than 15 years of age registered from 1969 to 1989 in the Japan Children's Cancer Registry were reviewed. The incidence of NF1 in each type of cancer was compared with that in the Japanese population. RESULTS: Fifty-six children with cancer had NF1 in the national registry. The incidence of NF1 (0.21%) was 6.45 times that of the expected estimated rate of 1 per 3000 in the Japanese population. These tumors tended to be type and site specific. The NF1 incidence was extremely high in optical nerve glioma (12.5%), other central nervous system gliomas (0.9%), and malignant schwannoma (31.4%). For nonneural tumors, NF1 incidence was increased in rhabdomyosarcoma (1.36%), particularly those in urogenital organs, and in myelogenous leukemia (0.27%). Epithelial carcinomas were not observed in the group of patients with NF1. CONCLUSION: The risk for glioma and malignant schwannoma increases in children and adults with NF1. Moreover, the risk for two childhood malignancies, myelogenous leukemia and rhabdomyosarcoma, increases in children with NF1. The NF1 gene seems to increase the risk not only for neural tumors but also for some non-neural tumors in an age-specific, organ-dependent pattern of carcinogenesis.","['Matsui, I', 'Tanimura, M', 'Kobayashi, N', 'Sawada, T', 'Nagahara, N', 'Akatsuka, J']","['Matsui I', 'Tanimura M', 'Kobayashi N', 'Sawada T', 'Nagahara N', 'Akatsuka J']","[""Department of Child Ecology, National Children's Medical Research Center, Tokyo, Japan.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Japan/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Neurofibromatosis 1/complications/*epidemiology', '*Registries']",1993/11/01 00:00,1993/11/01 00:01,['1993/11/01 00:00'],"['1993/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19931101)72:9<2746::aid-cncr2820720936>3.0.co;2-w [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1993 Nov 1;72(9):2746-54. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19931101)72:9<2746::aid-cncr2820720936>3.0.co;2-w.,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The infection risk associated with parenteral nutrition was assessed in 310 pediatric patients with cancer. These patients had central venous access devices (CVAD), Hickman/Broviac (H/B) catheters, or implantable subcutaneous ports in place for the delivery of chemotherapy and supportive care. RESULTS: The median duration of CVAD placement was 363 days; a total of 450 patient years (i.e., the sum of the total years of catheters experienced from all patients studied) were examined. Overall, the infection rate was 0.06 infections/100 days. During the period of parenteral nutrition administration, the rate increased to 0.5 infections/100 days. Among patients who received parenteral nutrition, there were no significant differences in any clinical parameter between the patients who developed an infection and those who did not. When evaluating the entire study population, infection was more likely to occur in patients who had acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (P < 0.01) or H/B catheters (P < 0.01), or who received parenteral nutrition (P < 0.02); there was no relationship between infection and catheter duration, days hospitalized, or days neutropenic (absolute neutrophil count < 0.5 x 10(9)/l). Only CVAD type and parenteral nutrition retained significance in a multivariate Cox proportional hazards model. After adjustment for diagnosis and CVAD type, the risk of infection was 2.4-fold greater in patients given parenteral nutrition (95% confidence interval 1.5 to 3.9; P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: These data confirm that administration of parenteral nutrition is associated with an increased risk of infection in children who have CVAD in place for cancer therapy.","['Christensen, M L', 'Hancock, M L', 'Gattuso, J', 'Hurwitz, C A', 'Smith, C', 'McCormick, J', 'Mirro, J Jr']","['Christensen ML', 'Hancock ML', 'Gattuso J', 'Hurwitz CA', 'Smith C', 'McCormick J', 'Mirro J Jr']","[""Pharmaceutical Division, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Catheterization, Central Venous/adverse effects/*statistics & numerical data', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infections/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications/therapy', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/complications/*therapy', 'Parenteral Nutrition/adverse effects/methods/*statistics & numerical data', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/therapy', 'Risk']",1993/11/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1993/11/01 00:00'],"['1993/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1993/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19931101)72:9<2732::aid-cncr2820720934>3.0.co;2-e [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1993 Nov 1;72(9):2732-8. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19931101)72:9<2732::aid-cncr2820720934>3.0.co;2-e.,,,,,,,,"['CA-20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,

METHODS: Forty patients who had been treated for a malignant tumor and who developed a second primary tumor detected by FNA and subsequently confirmed by histologic examination were studied. The primary tumors were malignant lymphoma (15 cases); breast carcinoma (10 cases); cutaneous melanoma (3 cases); carcinoma of the larynx and of the uterine cervix (2 cases each); and dysgerminoma of the ovary, chronic myeloid leukemia, and carcinoma of the nose, floor of the mouth, tonsil, anus, kidney, and skin (one case each). The interval between the diagnosis of the first and second malignant tumors ranged from 1 month to 22 years. RESULTS: Carcinoma of the lung, mainly represented by adenocarcinoma, was the most frequent second malignant tumor that occurred in this series (15 cases). It was followed by carcinoma of the breast (5 cases); soft tissue sarcoma (3 cases); and carcinoma of the liver, kidneys, ovaries, thyroid gland (2 cases each), parotid gland, and skin. Five cases of non-Hodgkin lymphoma and one of Hodgkin disease developed in patients with a previous carcinoma at various sites.

Adult T-cell lymphoma/leukemia (ATL), a disease caused by HTLV-I, has an incidence of 1-2/100,000 in the Jamaican population. Familial ATL has not previously been reported from Jamaica. METHODS: Hospital records and histologic specimens of the two cases were reviewed. HTLV-I infection was confirmed by antibody testing and by polymerase chain reaction on paraffin-embedded tissue, where serum was unavailable. Family members were identified by the patients' parents. After giving informed consent, family members were asked to complete an interviewer-administered questionnaire and to agree to phlebotomy. RESULTS: ATL developed 10 years apart in two siblings from a Jamaican family at age 16 and 24 years. A study of 19 members of their extended family, including both parents, 2 grandparents, and 3 siblings, revealed an overall HTLV-I seroprevalence of 17%. This compared with 75% among parents and siblings living in the same household as the patients. HTLV-I antibody-positive (HTLV-I-positive) and negative family members had similar mean age. Three of 3 HTLV-I-positive subjects were breast-fed, compared with 10 of 15 HTLV-I-negative subjects. Intravenous drug abuse, sex with prostitutes, homosexuality, and blood transfusion were not reported. The mean number of sexual partners were similar. Both parents, who were antibody-positive, had polylobated atypical lymphocytes in their peripheral blood. CONCLUSION: The HTLV-I antibody seroprevalence is greater in the family than in the general population, consistent with the modes of transmission. The antibody seronegativity of both grandmothers suggests sexual transmission between parents. The development of ATL at age 16 and 24 years is consistent with maternal-infant transmission and a long latent period, as reported by other authors.","['Wilks, R J', 'LaGrenade, L', 'Hanchard, B', 'Campbell, M', 'Murphy, J', 'Cranston, B', 'Blattner, W A', 'Manns, A']","['Wilks RJ', 'LaGrenade L', 'Hanchard B', 'Campbell M', 'Murphy J', 'Cranston B', 'Blattner WA', 'Manns A']","['Department of Medicine, University of the West Indies, Kingston, Jamaica.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Female', 'HTLV-I Infections/*transmission', 'Humans', 'Jamaica', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*genetics', 'Male', 'Pedigree']",1993/11/01 00:00,1993/11/01 00:01,['1993/11/01 00:00'],"['1993/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19931101)72:9<2700::aid-cncr2820720929>3.0.co;2-9 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1993 Nov 1;72(9):2700-4. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19931101)72:9<2700::aid-cncr2820720929>3.0.co;2-9.,,,,,,,,['N01-CP-31006/CP/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,

Results of the Associazione Italiana Ematologia Oncologia Pediatrica '82 studies.,2517-24,"BACKGROUND: In 1982, the Associazione Italiana Ematologia Oncologia Pediatrica (AIEOP) started its third-generation study, aiming to improve previous results obtained by AIEOP '79 study and to deliver a standardized treatment to most Italian children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). METHODS: We treated 902 children (older than 1 year and younger than 15 years of age) with newly diagnosed ALL in multicenter studies of risk-directed therapy (111 low risk [LR] from Study 8201; 570 average risk [AR] from Study 8202; and 117 and 104 high risk [HR] from Studies 8303 and 8503, respectively). Induction therapy was composed of vincristine, prednisone, and asparaginase for LR or AR patients and these agents plus daunorubicin, (Study 8503) or vincristine, prednisone, cytarabine, and intermediate-dose methotrexate (Study 8303) for HR patients. Central nervous system (CNS) preventive therapy consisted of intrathecal methotrexate only (LR), intrathecal methotrexate plus 18 Gy cranial irradiation (AR and HR Study 8503), or high-dose (HD) cytarabine (HR Study 8303). Reinduction therapy was vincristine/prednisone/daunorubicin for AR patients with cyclophosphamide added for HR patients in Study 8303 and HD asparaginase in Study 8503. LR patients did not receive intensification therapy. Continuation therapy comprised 6-mercaptopurine plus methotrexate and monthly pulses with vincristine plus prednisone for all patients, except for HR patients in Study 8303 who also received teniposide plus cytarabine. Weekly HD asparaginase was also given in Study 8503. Duration of treatment was 24 months for Studies 8201 and 8202, 15 months for Study 8303, and 22 months for Study 8503. The overall complete remission (CR) rate was 94.7% (97.3% for LR, 94.9% for AR, and 93.2% for HR). RESULTS: Overall 7-year event-free survival (EFS) was 53.6% (standard error [SE], 1.8). EFS was 60.8% in LR (SE, 4.7), 60.6% in AR at 7 years (SE, 4.7), and 18.5% in Study 8303 (HR) at 5 years (SE, 3.8). Because of the poor result in HR patients, a successor study (8503) was developed that yielded a 5-year EFS of 46.1% (SE, 5.1). Site-specific relapse rates were 18.5% (LR), 13.4% (AR), 35.1% (HR on 8303), and 18.3% (HR in Study 8503) for bone marrow and 9.2%, 7.9%, 17.5%, and 19.3%, respectively, for the CNS (isolated). Isolated testicular relapse was observed in 3.9% of male patients. CONCLUSIONS: This risk-directed therapy cured at least 50% of patients with ALL with relatively nonintensive therapy. The 80% overall survival rate for LR and AR patients at 7 years suggested that the total cure rate may be higher than 50% because of the significant salvage rate for patients who received antimetabolite-based therapy initially.","['Vecchi, V', 'Arico, M', 'Basso, G', 'Ceci, A', 'Madon, E', 'Mandelli, F', 'Masera, G', 'Massimo, L', 'Pession, A', 'Zanesco, L']","['Vecchi V', 'Arico M', 'Basso G', 'Ceci A', 'Madon E', 'Mandelli F', 'Masera G', 'Massimo L', 'Pession A', 'Zanesco L', 'et al.']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Bologna, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cranial Irradiation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Italy', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/mortality/radiotherapy/*therapy', 'Remission Induction', 'Risk', 'Survival Rate']",1993/10/15 00:00,1993/10/15 00:01,['1993/10/15 00:00'],"['1993/10/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/10/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/10/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19931015)72:8<2517::aid-cncr2820720834>3.0.co;2-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1993 Oct 15;72(8):2517-24. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19931015)72:8<2517::aid-cncr2820720834>3.0.co;2-1.,,,,,,,,,,

Overall, a child diagnosed with ANLL has a 35-50% of remaining alive long term, without disease. Induction chemotherapy with cytarabine and daunorubicin will achieve remission in about 80% of children with ANLL. So far, intensifying induction chemotherapy by adding more agents has not changed this result significantly. Major changes in induction chemotherapy may come from either new chemotherapeutic agents or biological agents that hasten bone marrow recovery after treatment. Such an approach might allow more dose-intensive drug administration without increased toxicity. Another question that is slowly being answered with the ongoing trials is the one concerning maintenance. So far, all the pediatric trials that have tried to shorten the maintenance therapy of this disease were able to do so without jeopardizing the final outcome. The final optimal minimal duration of therapy has yet to be established. The best therapy for a patient who has achieved a remission is still the most difficult question regarding the treatment of this disease. So far, allogeneic BMT has yielded the best results, with a disease-free interval varying between 55 and 65%. However, one-third of these patients have chronic GvHD and, therefore, a somewhat diminished quality of life. As preparative regimens and marrow purging protocols evolve, the results of autologous bone marrow transplantation seem to be improving, with disease-free intervals of 35-50% reported.","['Boulad, F', 'Kernan, N A']","['Boulad F', 'Kernan NA']","['Department of Pediatrics, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10021.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Cancer Invest,Cancer investigation,8307154,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/pathology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Salvage Therapy']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/07357909309011672 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Invest. 1993;11(5):534-53. doi: 10.3109/07357909309011672.,94,,,,,,,,,

The intracellular dTTP pool decreased to half the control level 1-6 hr after the administration of 5-FU. The dTTP pools rapidly recovered after 6 hr. In contrast, UFT kept the intracellular dTTP level to 1/3 to 1/2 of the control level for 24 hr. Either drug elevated the intracellular dATP pools, but decreased dCTP pools. UFT influenced the intracellular dATP and dCTP levels longer than 5-FU. Orally administered UFT seemed to exert a longer and more potent inhibitory effect on thymidylate synthetase than equimolar 5-FU. In view of these results, we suggest that UFT could be a more potent chemotherapeutic drug than 5-FU in oral administration.","['Kakito, H', 'Ohkubo, T', 'Kagawa, Y', 'Inagaki, S', 'Sumida, K', 'Ooi, K', 'Higashigawa, M', 'Sakurai, M']","['Kakito H', 'Ohkubo T', 'Kagawa Y', 'Inagaki S', 'Sumida K', 'Ooi K', 'Higashigawa M', 'Sakurai M']","['Department of Pharmacy, Mie University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cancer Invest,Cancer investigation,8307154,"['0 (Deoxyribonucleotides)', '1548R74NSZ (Tegafur)', '56HH86ZVCT (Uracil)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Deoxyribonucleotides/*metabolism', 'Fluorouracil/*pharmacology', 'Injections, Intraperitoneal', 'Leukemia L1210/*metabolism/mortality', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Tegafur/*pharmacology', 'Uracil/*pharmacology']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/07357909309011671 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Invest. 1993;11(5):530-3. doi: 10.3109/07357909309011671.,,,,,,,,,,

Most patients with diabetes mellitus respond to conventional periodontal treatment, but in some cases the response may be related to the degree of metabolic control. Periodontal treatment may have a beneficial effect on the metabolic status of poorly controlled diabetes. Tetracycline therapy may be an effective adjunctive treatment in the management of periodontal disease in diabetic patients by blocking collagenase-dependent periodontal tissue destruction. Pyostomatitis vegetans is frequently associated with chronic inflammatory bowel disease and is a marker for the disease.

Enzymatic immunoassay (EIA) was used for both IL-6 and LIF, while GM-CSF was evaluated in a highly sensitive biological assay provided by GM-CSF-dependent M-07e cells. A significant decrease of IL-6 was detected in 9 out of 11 FA patients compared with five normal donors, while similar amounts of LIF were produced from 21 FA patients and 21 healthy subjects. A drastic increase of active GM-CSF was documented in PHA-stimulated PBMC-conditioned medium in all 18 FA patients tested.

Previous studies have shown that retinoic acid (RA) and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25(OH)2 D3] have potent effects on the proliferation and differentiation of HIMeg cells. Recently, the effect of dexamethasone (Dex), a synthetic glucocorticoid, on HIMeg cell growth and differentiation was examined in comparison with RA and sex steroid hormones. It was observed that in a methylcellulose culture system, Dex suppressed the clonal proliferation of HIMeg cells in a dose-dependent manner. The inhibitory effects of Dex could be reversed by RU486, a potent glucocorticoid antagonist. In contrast, sex steroid hormones had little effect on the clonal proliferation of HIMeg cells. In a liquid culture system, only 2% of HIMeg cells expressed glycoprotein IIb/IIIa (GPIIb/IIIa) antigen without hormone treatment, whereas 45% and 30% of the cells expressed GPIIb/IIIa following the addition of RA and Dex, respectively. To examine the molecular basis of the hormone-induced cell differentiation, glucocorticoid receptor (GR) expression was studied by Scatchard analysis. It was shown that there existed a saturable, high-affinity GR in HIMeg cells and the GR number was altered after Dex or RA treatment of the cells, suggesting that the cellular effects of glucocorticoids on HIMeg cells were mediated by GR.","['Song, L N', 'Cheng, T']","['Song LN', 'Cheng T']","['Department of Pathophysiology, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Stem Cells,"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",9304532,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Glucocorticoid)', '0 (dexamethasone receptor)', '320T6RNW1F (Mifepristone)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Dexamethasone/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/*pathology', 'Megakaryocytes/*drug effects', 'Mifepristone/pharmacology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins/biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Glucocorticoid/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",1993/07/01 00:00,1993/07/01 00:01,['1993/07/01 00:00'],"['1993/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/stem.5530110409 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells. 1993 Jul;11(4):312-8. doi: 10.1002/stem.5530110409.,,,,,,,,,,

We determined whether SOD protects leukemic cells from the effects of ionizing irradiation both in vitro and in vivo.

This article reviews the evidence demonstrating graft-versus-leukemia effect in clinical bone marrow transplantation, some approaches to dissociate graft-versus-leukemia from graft-versus-host disease, and attempts to induce graft-versus-leukemia reactions in the setting of autologous bone marrow transplantation by immunotherapy.","['Mehta, J']",['Mehta J'],"['Leukaemia Unit, Royal Marsden Hospital, Surrey, England, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,IM,"['*Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects/immunology', 'Graft vs Host Disease', 'Graft vs Host Reaction/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/therapy', 'Recurrence', '*Transplantation Immunology']",1993/08/01 00:00,1993/08/01 00:01,['1993/08/01 00:00'],"['1993/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199309148199 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1993 Aug;10(6):427-32. doi: 10.3109/10428199309148199.,40,,,,,,,,,

Relapse rates however, are higher if BMT is carried out in transformation or blast crisis. Leukemic relapse in donor cells following transplantation for CGL is a rare event. The occurrence of donor leukemia however, may be under reported as accurate and sensitive investigation of the origin of relapsed leukemia following BMT requires DNA based technologies. A possible mechanism of donor leukemia in CGL is transfection of donor cells with the chimeric gene which is unique to this disease. It is possible that the malignant cells found in transformed or blast crisis of CGL may have a greater potential to transfect donor haematopoietic material. Careful evaluation of the incidence of donor leukemia using molecular biology methods may elucidate the frequency of this event following BMT for CGL.","['McCann, S R', 'Lawler, M', 'Bacigalupo, A']","['McCann SR', 'Lawler M', 'Bacigalupo A']","['Department of Hematology, St. James Hospital, Dublin, Ireland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,IM,"['Animals', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*etiology/genetics/*therapy', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Recurrence', 'Transfection']",1993/08/01 00:00,1993/08/01 00:01,['1993/08/01 00:00'],"['1993/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199309148198 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1993 Aug;10(6):419-25. doi: 10.3109/10428199309148198.,57,,,,,,,,,

Data from various laboratories, including our own, indicate that both normal and leukemia precursors proliferate in response to growth factors. Furthermore, it has been shown that AML blasts, low-density cells from CML patients with advanced disease, and cultured bone marrow-adherent layers from CML blast crisis patients produce interleukin 1 (IL-1); this molecule may play a pivotal role in driving leukemia cell proliferation through autocrine or paracrine pathways. We have therefore hypothesized that interruption of the IL-1-mediated growth-stimulatory mechanism may suppress leukemia precursor multiplication. In searching for IL-1-inhibitory molecules that may be used clinically, we have investigated the in vitro effects of various IL-1 inhibitors including IL-1 receptor antagonist, soluble IL-1 receptors, and interleukin 4. Our studies suggest that IL-1 inhibitors can suppress clonogenic growth of cultured AML and CML progenitors and may hence be exploitable in clinical trials.","['Estrov, Z', 'Kurzrock, R', 'Talpaz, M']","['Estrov Z', 'Kurzrock R', 'Talpaz M']","['Department of Medical Oncology, University of Texas M.

In contrast, K562-IF does not affect the oxidative burst induced by soluble compounds such as fMetLeuPhe and phorbol esters. Analysis of the mechanism of action of K562-IF on neutrophils showed that it involves an adherence protein, mainly CR3 (the receptor of complement fraction iC3b). Neither, CR3 expression nor its up-regulation were altered, whereas the function of CR3 was depressed, i.e., it failed to cap upon neutrophil stimulation and did not bind iC3b.

We examined expression of IL-8 and its receptor in purified leukemic cells from patients with untreated acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) and lymphoid leukemias. In the majority of cases (18 of 26 AML, 8 of 15 lymphoid leukemias), the cells constitutively expressed IL-8 mRNA transcripts. In all but 3 of these cases, IL-8 mRNA-expressing cells secreted biologically active IL-8 protein. Immunocytochemical analysis showed intracellular IL-8 (5% to 90% of total cells), demonstrating that the leukemic cells themselves rather than contaminants (monocytes or lymphocytes) were the source of IL-8. Ten of 25 AML samples expressed IL-8 receptor mRNA and, with 1 exception, the IL-8 receptor expressing cells also produced its ligand. In contrast, all lymphoid leukemias were negative. Furthermore, frequent coexpression of IL-8 and IL-1 beta transcripts was seen in both AML and lymphoid leukemia samples, whereas fewer cases coexpressed IL-8 and either macrophage colony-stimulating factor or granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. In leukemic cells expressing the IL-8 receptor, IL-8 induced cytosolic free calcium changes, indicating activation of the classical signaling pathway.
