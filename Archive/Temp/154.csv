However, the use of cord blood as a source of cells for transplantation is limited by its cell number, usually below 1 billion, which allows for routine transplantation only in children weighting less than 30 kg, while most potential recipients possess a higher body mass. This led to the idea of the simultaneous use of several units of cord blood which, combined, would fulfill the requirements for the necessary cell number for an adult recipient. MATERIAL/METHODS: We attempted to simultaneously transplant an adult patient with refractory acute myeloblastic leukemia utilizing two different cord blood units, one fully matched and one mismatched at one locus. RESULTS: The patient became reconstituted with only one unit, the mismatched, as determined using microsatellite markers, and had no signs of relapse of leukemia. Unfortunately, he died of persistent fungal (brain aspergilloma) infection on day +103. CONCLUSIONS: The successful engraftment may suggest that a method based on the principle of using more than one cord blood unit for transplantation is feasible in large adult patients and may reach routine application.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of our study was to assess the function of T lymphocytes in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) during remission induction based on selected cytokine and co-stimulatory/activatory molecule expression. MATERIAL/METHODS: The study group consisted of 50 children with ALL (B cell precursor). Peripheral blood samples were taken before treatment (day 0), after the prednisone prophase (day 8), and during (day 15) and after (day 33) remission induction. The percentages of T cells with interferon (IFN)-gamma (Th(1)), interleukin (IL)-4 (Th(2)) and IL-2 receptor (IL-2R), CD28, CTLA-4, CD38, ICAM-1, and HLA-DR expression were assessed by tricolor flow cytometry. RESULTS: At the time of diagnosis we noted higher percentages of T cells with adhesion molecule ICAM-1, activation molecule CD38 expression, and an increased population of Th(2 )cells (IL-4) compared with the control group. During and after remission induction we observed a decreased population of CD38(+) T cells, elevated percentages of helper T lymphocytes with IL-2R expression, and a rise in helper T lymphocytes producing IFN-gamma (Th(1)). During fever/infection, higher levels of activated T lymphocytes (CD4(+)HLA-DR(+), CD8(+)HLA-DR(+)), a rise in Th1, and no change in Th(2 )populations were observed. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest T cell activation and Th(2 )predominance at the time of diagnosis and during remission induction in ALL in children. These results confirm the involvement of cellular immunity in the leukemic process and can be used in immune therapy in leukemia.","['0 (CD28 Antigens)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '126547-89-5 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Cytotoxicity was evaluated by MTS assays and apoptosis by flow cytometry analyses of DNA fragmentation and phosphatidylserine exposure. The mRNAs of A(3)AR and inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) were determined by RT-PCR. RESULTS: A(3)AR expression was similar in HL-60 and HL-60R cells. At > or =100 microM, IB-MECA exhibited strong cytotoxic and apoptotic effects in HL-60, but not in HL-60R cells. This activity was not modified by the A(3)AR antagonist VUF5574, the P-glycoprotein inhibitor verapamil, the adenosine uptake inhibitor NBTI or the anti-Fas antibody ZB4. HL-60R cells showed higher levels of different IAPs than HL-60 cells. IB-MECA 100 microM downregulated HIAP1, NAIP and survivin mRNAs in HL-60, but not in HL-60R cells. CONCLUSIONS: The antitumor effects of IB-MECA are not mediated by A(3)AR in HL-60 cells, where the proapoptotic mechanism of the compound may involve downregulation of IAPs.

Epub 2005 Aug 8.,"PURPOSE: To determine the association between depression and survival among cancer patients at 1, 3, and 5 years after stem-cell transplantation (SCT). PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a prospective cohort study of 199 hematologic cancer patients who survived longer than 90 days after SCT and who were recruited in a University-based hospital between July 1994 and August 1997. Patients received a psychiatric assessment at four consecutive time points during hospitalization for SCT, yielding a total of 781 interviews. Depression diagnoses were determined on the basis of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition. RESULTS: Eighteen (9.0%) and 17 patients (8.5%) met criteria for major and minor depression, respectively. Multivariate Cox regression models found major depression to be predictive of higher 1-year (hazard ratio [HR], 2.59; 95% CI, 1.21 to 5.53; P = .014) and 3-year mortality (HR, 2.04; 95% CI, 1.03 to 4.02; P = .041) but not 5-year mortality (HR, 1.48; 95% CI, 0.76 to 2.87; P = .249). Minor depression had no effect on any mortality outcome. Other multivariate significant predictors of higher mortality were higher regimen toxicity in the 1-, 3-, and 5-year models; older age and acute lymphoblastic leukemia in the 3- and 5-year models; chronic myelogenous leukemia in the 3-year model; and lower functional status and intermediate/higher risk status in the 5-year model. Use of peripheral-blood stem cells predicted lower mortality in the 5-year model. CONCLUSION: After adjusting for multiple factors, major depression predicted higher 1- and 3-year mortality among cancer patients after SCT, underscoring the importance of adequate diagnosis and treatment of major depression.",,,20050808,,['J Clin Oncol. 2005 Sep 1;23(25):5878-80.

METHODS: The California Cancer Registry was used to identify diagnosed cases of 19 common malignancies during a 6-year period. Cases were linked to a hospital discharge database to identify incident VTE events in the year before the cancer diagnosis date. The standardized incidence ratio (SIR) of unprovoked VTE was determined by using the age-, race-, and sex-specific incidence rates in California. RESULTS: Among 528,693 cancer cases, 596 (0.11%) were associated with a diagnosis of unprovoked VTE within 1 year of the cancer diagnosis, compared with 443.0 expected cases (SIR, 1.3; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-1.5; P<.001). Among cases with metastatic-stage cancer, the SIR was 2.3 (95% confidence interval, 2.0-2.6; P<.001), whereas for all other stages, the SIR was 1.07 (95% confidence interval, 0.97-1.18; P = .09). The incidence of preceding VTE was increased over that expected only during the 4-month period immediately preceding the cancer diagnosis date (P<.001). Only 7 cancer types were associated with a significantly elevated SIR: acute myelogenous leukemia; non-Hodgkin lymphoma; and renal cell, ovarian, pancreatic, stomach, and lung cancer (SIR range, 1.8-4.2). CONCLUSIONS: In the year preceding the diagnosis of cancer, the number of cases with unprovoked VTE was modestly higher than expected, and almost all of the unexpected VTE cases were associated with a diagnosis of metastatic-stage cancer within 4 months. Given the timing and advanced stage of the unexpected cases, it is unlikely that earlier diagnosis of these cancers would have significantly improved long-term survival.",,,,,,['5RO3CA099527-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have investigated the activity of resveratrol on proliferation and differentiation of the acute promyelocytic leukemia cell line NB4. The growth inhibitory properties of resveratrol appear to be due to its induction of apoptotic cell death, as determined by morphological changes, DNA fragmentation, increased proportion of the subdiploid cell population and decreased mitochondrial transmembrane potential (Deltapsi(m)). Colorimetric assay for activity of caspase-3 showed an obvious increase in caspase-3 activity in cells after treatment with resveratrol. However, the expression levels of protein Bcl-2 and Bax show no significant change in response to resveratrol treatment. These results suggest that apoptosis of NB4 cells induced by resveratrol requires caspase-3 activation and is related to the mitochondrial transmembrane potential. The combination of resveratrol and all-tran-retinoic acid (ATRA) induced 100% of the NB4 cells to become NBT-positive, whereas only a small part of cells became positive for NBT after a similar exposure to either resveratrol or ATRA alone. Thus, resveratrol may be useful in treating acute promyelocytic leukemia.","['0 (Anticarcinogenic Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Stilbenes)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'Q369O8926L (Resveratrol)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They were identified by spectroscopic methods. The inhibitory effects of 1-6 on the proliferation of mammalian cancer cells have been evaluated by the SRB (sulforhodamine B) method and their effects on cell cycle and apoptosis investigated by flow cytometry with the morphological observation under light microscope and by agarose-gel electrophoresis to detect internucleosomal DNA fragmentation.

BMSCs with normal functions have direct antitumur effects on leukemic cells. They can regulate the immunity remarkably. Genetically engineered BMSCs can deliver target therapeutic proteins over sufficient time after in vivo transplantation. Thus, BMSCs are considered to be an ideal therapeutic cell vehicle and target cells in the gene therapy for leukemia.

Some researches on solid tumors show that cisplatin (DDP) have synergetic effect with VP-16. This study was to evaluate synergetic cytotoxicity of VP-16 and DDP to leukemia cell line K562, and explore the mechanism. METHODS: K562 cells were treated with VP-16 (0 or 5 microg/ml) and DDP (0, 0.3, 3, 15, or 30 microg/ml) in different combination patterns. Inhibitory effect of VP-16 and DDP on survival of K562 cells was measured by MTT assay. Cell apoptosis was evaluated by AO/EB double fluorescent labeling. The expression of topoisomerase (TOPO) II alpha and II beta, and transcription factor Sp1 and Sp3 were measured by semi-quantitive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blot. RESULTS: MTT assay showed significant synergetic cytotoxicity of VP-16 and DDP. VP-16 in combination with DDP obviously enhanced cell apoptosis. RT-PCR showed that DDP significantly up-regulated the expression of TOPO II and Sp1 in concentration-dependent manners (TOPO II alpha, II beta, and Sp1 were up-regulated by 36%, 25%, and 75% of control, respectively, when treated with 30 microg/ml of DDP), and down-regulated Sp3 by 49% of control; VP-16 (5 microg/ml) down-regulated TOPO II alpha by 71.9%, and up-regulated Sp3 by 14%; VP-16 (5 microg/ml) in combination with DDP (30 microg/ml) up-regulated TOPO II alpha by 83%, II beta by 11%, and Sp1 by 58% when compared with using VP-16 alone (but the levels were lower than using DDP alone), and down-regulated Sp3 by 61.3% when compared with using DDP alone. Western blot showed similar results to RT-PCR.

PROCEDURE: Data on young adults (15-24 years) diagnosed with cancer in the North of England from 1968 to 1997 were obtained from the Northern Region Young Person's Malignant Disease Registry. Temporal changes in incidence and survival rates were investigated. RESULTS: There were 2,329 first cancers diagnosed over the study period (M:F 1.22:1). Overall age standardized incidence was 174 cases per million 15-24 years old, per year, 190 for males and 157 for females. The most common cancers in young adults were Hodgkin disease (19%), carcinomas (15%), central nervous system tumors (14%), germ cell tumors (13%), and leukemia (11%). Comparing incidence for 1968-1977 with 1988-1997 there were significant increases in the incidence of bone tumors (rate ratio 1.72, 95% CI 1.10-2.68), testicular tumors (rate ratio 1.64, 95% CI 1.16-2.32), thyroid cancer (rate ratio 2.63, 95% CI 1.37-5.02), and malignant melanoma (rate ratio 2.04, 95% CI 1.36-3.08). Survival rates improved significantly (P < 0.001) over the study period; 5-year survival rates over the three time periods 1968-1977, 1978-1987, 1988-1997 for all cancers were 45% (95% CI 41%-49%), 62% (95% CI 58%-65%), and 74% (95% CI 71%-77%) respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Survival rates improved and there were significant increases in incidence for specific cancers in young adults in the North of England. Further research is required to identify the reasons for changing incidence and to investigate the late effects of treatment among survivors.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PROCEDURE: Methodological study using 6-MP metabolite levels from 48 adolescent ALL patients enrolled in a multicenter adherence study. Cluster analysis was the primary analytical technique. We used two validation methods (a split-sampling and a simulation technique) for validating the results. RESULTS: Four clusters were retained in our initial analysis using our first group of patients (n = 27). Three clusters (labeled 1, 2, and 4) exhibited the expected negative correlation between the two metabolites, that is, ""high"" values of one were associated with ""low"" values of the other. One cluster (labeled 3) had ""low"" levels for both TGN and MMP. Five of the 27 adolescents had their 6-MP ""held"" during the study. Post-hoc examination of the results revealed that all five grouped in Cluster 3 during the time that their medications were stopped, but grouped in other clusters at other times. The median ANC was highest in Cluster 3, consistent with low therapeutic drug levels. Parameters were reproducible with both validation methods. Values below the respective 75th centile for both TGN and MMP in Cluster 3 for the complete sample (n = 48) are suggested as representing a potentially higher risk for relapse. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides an objective method for identifying patients at risk for treatment failure due to suboptimal 6-MP therapy; the clinical significance of this approach should be examined in future studies.","['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)']",,,,['Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2006 Feb;46(2):120-1.

Epub 2005 Sep 22.,"PURPOSE: The aim of this study is to test the predictive power of in vivo multiorgan RNA expression profiling in identifying the biologic activity of molecules. METHODS: Animals were treated with compound A or B. At the end of the treatment period, in vivo multiorgan microarray-based gene expression data were collected. Investigators masked to the identity of the compounds analyzed the transcriptome signatures to define the molecular pathways affected by treatment and to hypothesize the biologic activity and potential therapeutic indications of the blinded compounds. RESULTS: For compound A, G-protein-coupled receptors and factors associated with cell growth were affected-growth hormone/insulin-like growth factor-1, glucagon/insulin axes, and general somatomedin-like activity. Deblinding showed the compound to be a somatostatin analog, SOM230, confirming the accuracy of the predicted biologic activity. For compound B, components of the inflammatory cascade potentially mediated by lipopolysaccharide, tumor necrosis factor, or proinflammatory cytokines were affected. The gene expression signatures were most consistent with an interleukin-6 family activity. Deblinding revealed that compound B was leukemia inhibitory factor. CONCLUSIONS: VeloceGenomics is a strategy of coupling in vivo compound testing with genomic technologies. The process enables prediction of the mechanism of action and, coupled with other relevant data, prediction of the suitability of compounds for advancement in the drug development process.","['0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '51110-01-1 (Somatostatin)', '98H1T17066 (pasireotide)']",,20050922,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CONCLUSION: Compared with VM, Fludarabine regimen was a very effective alternative treatment for CR induction in adult patients with refractory and relapsed ALL and low toxicity.","['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '957E6438QA (Teniposide)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, after only 10 months, in December 2003, the trial was stopped due to a low enrollment of seven patients at three of the 15 sites that were open for accrual. Six of the seven patients completed the drug infusion. Two patients experienced serious bleeding events. The first patient developed a nonfatal diffuse alveolar hemorrhage 2 days after study-drug completion. The second patient had severe coagulopathy and developed a fatal intracranial hemorrhage on the third day of drug infusion. Three of the seven patients were alive 100 days after the HSCT. The slow enrollment rate was attributed to changes in transplant preparatory regimens, enhancements in antimicrobial prophylactic protocols and the use of antimicrobial-coated catheters.

In this study, we investigated the downstream signalling events of AF-induced apoptosis to determine the molecular mechanisms of AF activity. Treatment of HL-60 cells with AF induced apoptosis in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Western blot analysis showed that AF-induced apoptosis was accompanied by the activation of caspase-8, caspase-9, and caspase-3, and the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria. The phosphorylation and kinase activities of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) increased gradually until 12 h after AF (2 microM) treatment, and p38 MAPK was also activated concentration-dependently. Pretreatment with SB203580, a specific inhibitor of p38 MAPK, significantly blocked DNA fragmentation and the cleavage of procaspase-8, procaspase-3, and poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP), whereas SB203580 alone had no effect. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) were also detected within 1 h after AF treatment, and the antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) effectively protected the cells from apoptosis by inhibiting the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and the activation of caspases. These results suggest that ROS generation and the subsequent activation of p38 MAPK are essential for the proapoptotic effects of AF in human promyelocytic leukaemia HL-60 cells.","['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Antirheumatic Agents)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '3H04W2810V (Auranofin)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'OU13V1EYWQ (SB 203580)', 'WYQ7N0BPYC (Acetylcysteine)']",,,,,,PMC1751188,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, phosphorylated H3 was seen in DOX-resistant but not in DOX-sensitive cells.

Based on its clinical activity, GO has been approved for application in chemotherapy-refractory AML in various countries and is effective as a mono-substance as well as in combination with conventional chemotherapy. However, despite high efficacy and a certain specificity for leukemic (as opposed to normal) stem cells, the drug does not work in all patients, and can produce significant side-effects, including veno-occlusive disease (VOD), especially in patients who undergo stem cell transplantation.

Reliable methods for uniformly recognising these two subgroups at presentation do not exist and therefore a further attempt has been made to relate in vitro toxicity, using a clonogenic assay, to clinical outcome. In 10 normal controls and 12 chemotherapy naive cases, mononuclear cells harvested by density gradient separation were re-suspended at a concentration of 2 x 10(5)/ml and quadruplicates of 250 microl per well cultured in methycellulose containing foetal calf serum and phytohaemagglutinin stimulated leucocyte conditioned medium. Cell kill was determined for cytosine arabinoside, daunorubicin and etoposide either singly or in combination using both a pulsed and continuous exposure. Aggregates were scored after seven days and three distinct patterns recognised. The patients all received the same drugs in a standard protocol and achievement of complete remission correlated with growth pattern. The survival of normal marrow colony-forming cells or GM-CFUc and the leukemic equivalent designated L-CFUc were assessed and a sensitivity index (SI) determined as a ratio of these two values in which more reproducible results were found when the drug was continuously present. It is concluded that the microculture technique is feasible and clearly demonstrates chemotherapy effect but no correlation was demonstrated with clinical outcome.

In the present study, we have addressed the possibility that the neuropeptide vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) may regulate the production of and/or sensitivity to the IL-6 family of cytokines in mouse calvarial osteoblasts. VIP stimulated IL-6 mRNA expression and protein release in a time- and concentration-dependent manner, whereas mRNA expression of the IL-6 receptor, as well as mRNA expressions of IL-11, LIF, OSM and their cognate receptors, were unaffected by VIP. In cells transfected with the IL-6 promoter coupled to luciferase, VIP increased transcriptional activity. The effects of VIP were shared by the related neuropeptide PACAP-38, belonging to the same superfamily of neuropeptides, whereas secretin did not have any effect, indicating that the effects were mediated by VPAC2 receptors. The effects of VIP were potentiated by the cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase inhibitor rolipram and mimicked by forskolin, indicating the involvement of the cyclic AMP/protein kinase A pathway. This was further demonstrated by the facts that the stimulatory effect of VIP on luciferase activity could be reversed by the PKA inhibitors H-89 and KT5720 and was mimicked by cyclic AMP analogues selective for PKA, but not by those selective for Epac. In addition, VIP enhanced the phosphorylation of CREB, as assessed by both immunocytochemical analysis and Western blot. The DNA binding activity of nuclear extracts to C/EBP was increased by VIP, whereas binding to AP-1 was decreased. In contrast, DNA binding to NF-kappaB, as well as nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB and C/EBP, were unaffected by VIP. The mRNA expressions of C/EBPbeta, C/EBPdelta, C/EBPgamma, c-Jun, JunB, c-Fos, Fra-1 and IkappaBalpha and protein level of IkappaBalpha were all unaffected by VIP. These observations, together, demonstrate that VIP stimulates IL-6 production in osteoblasts by a mechanism likely to be mediated by VPAC2 receptors and dependent on cyclic AMP/protein kinase A/CREB activation and also involving the transcription factors C/EBP and AP-1.","['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-1)', '37221-79-7 (Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These disorders display remarkable heterogeneity in their hematologic and pathologic features, with a wide-ranging natural history. Complex interactions between the affected clone and the bone marrow microenvironment drive the pathogenesis and progression of MDS, resulting in ineffective hematopoiesis, blast accumulation, and a variable predisposition for progression to acute leukemia. For early stage, lower-risk patients with MDS, the mainstay of therapy is supportive care, especially red blood cell transfusions, to alleviate the symptoms of anemia. However, these interventions do not target the underlying pathobiology of disease and have questionable impact on the natural disease course. Dysregulated inflammatory, apoptotic, and angiogenic cytokines play major roles in the pathobiology of MDS and represent attractive therapeutic targets. Lenalidomide is an orally bioavailable analogue of thalidomide with more potent immunomodulatory, antiangiogenic, and antitumor activities than the parent compound and with a better safety profile. In nonclinical studies, the effects of lenalidomide include potentiation of clonogenic response to erythropoietin, activation of integrin-mediated adhesion, cell cycle arrest, sensitization to apoptotic signals, and abrogation of cellular response to receptor-initiated trophic signals. These effects have the potential to impact survival and apoptosis of erythropoietic progenitor cells and their progeny. Data from clinical trials of lenalidomide in MDS have shown erythropoietic- and cytogenetic-remitting activities that frequently result in transfusion independence, particularly in patients with 5q- deletion and lower-risk MDS. Decreases in microvessel density in bone marrow specimens from responding patients provide supportive evidence of an antiangiogenic effect in MDS. Adverse effects, most commonly myelosuppression, are generally manageable with dose reduction and growth factor support. Multicenter phase II and III studies are under way to further assess the erythroid and cytogenetic response rates in distinct subtypes of MDS, including 5q- deletion, and to optimize its clinical application.","['0 (Immunologic Factors)', '4Z8R6ORS6L (Thalidomide)', 'F0P408N6V4 (Lenalidomide)']",30,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hallmarks of MDS are peripheral blood cytopenias (especially anemia), frequently with hypercellular bone marrow, and dysplastic changes in one or more hematopoietic lineages. The wide variation in clinical presentation has confounded treatment strategies and hindered the development of new therapies. However, improved classification and prognostic systems are providing a more refined stratification of patients, helping to guide treatment and management decisions as well as to appropriately select patients for clinical trials. Patients with International Prognostic Scoring System classifications of low- and intermediate-1 (Low/Int-1) risk are considered to have ""low-risk"" MDS. These patients are primarily treated with low-intensity supportive care, especially red blood cell transfusions, to treat their symptoms and maintain their quality of life. In small subsets of Low/Int-1-risk patients with MDS, hematopoietic cytokines or antithymocyte globulin may reduce transfusion requirements. The drawbacks to these treatments are high failure rates, even with improved predictive models, and the high cost of cytokines. Regardless of risk category, a patient's age and existing comorbidities must be factored into treatment decisions. It is anticipated that trials with new and investigational agents may soon provide definitive treatments for patients with Low/Int-1-risk MDS when used alone or in conjunction with supportive measures.","['0 (Antilymphocyte Serum)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",38,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The French-American-British (FAB) classification scheme for MDS was described in 1982 and has become the reference standard for subsequent MDS classification schemes. The FAB classification system divides MDS into five subgroups, based mainly on morphologic criteria and the percentage of myeloblasts in bone marrow (BM). More recently, the increasing availability of BM cytogenetics, immunologic markers, and molecular genetics has provided important information for staging, prognosis, and treatment of MDS. A World Health Organization panel incorporated this new diagnostic information into a revised classification system that modified the FAB criteria while retaining most of its basic features. The major changes included the creation of additional categories (eg, 5q- syndrome), distinction of unilineage from multilineage dysplasias in the refractory anemias, and subdivision of the heterogeneous refractory anemias with excess blasts into two categories based on BM blast percentage. Additionally, some MDS subtypes were removed or merged with other myeloid disorders into newly created categories. In independent validations, the World Health Organization revisions were shown to provide more-homogeneous subgroups of patients and greater prognostic power compared with the FAB system, although controversies remain. The International Prognostic Scoring System combines blast percentage, karyotype, and number of cytopenias to generate a scoring system that reliably estimates survival and risk of transformation to acute myeloid leukemia for patients with MDS. This universally accepted scoring system is often combined with FAB or World Health Organization morphologic criteria to provide a more complete clinical picture and the most accurate prognostic assessment possible. As more is learned about the pathogenesis of MDS at the molecular level, it is anticipated that these classification and scoring systems will continue to evolve to incorporate the new information.",,17,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Herein, we report on time- and dose-dependent effects of this compound on growth, differentiation, IMPDH inhibition, cell cycle and apoptosis of a panel of human leukemia cell lines (HL-60, K562 and Molt4). The drug decreased the growth of leukemia cells in less than 24 h of treatment. However, longer exposure times and/or higher concentrations were required to promote cell apoptosis. Cell cycle analysis revealed the accumulation of cells in their G1 phase as early as 12 h after drug exposure but sub-G1 population was recorded after 24 h. Occurrence of apoptosis was constantly accompanied by morphological (staining with DNA-binding dyes) and biochemical (DNA fragments) variations among drug-treated cells. Despite these observations, non-activated normal human PBL were insensitive to the drug action. In addition, treatment of PHA-activated PBL, K562, Molt4 and HL-60 cells with a single dose of the drug for 24 h led to the inhibition of IMPDH activity by almost 37, 38, 44 and 50%, respectively. In contrast, no difference in IMPDH activities were seen between normal PBL and the drug treated PBL cells. Restoration of the depleted GTP concentration by exogenous addition of guanosine (25-50 microM) reversed the drug effects on cell growth, DNA fragmentation and apoptosis. Furthermore, the drug effects were potentiated by exogenous addition of hypoxanthine to the drug-treated cells. Reduction of the drug potency on the non-proliferative (retinoic acid treated) HL-60 cells by almost 40%, compared to the proliferative cells, clearly shows type II IMPDH as one of the main targets of the drug. These results suggest that 3-HK may be a powerful candidate for treatment of leukemia.","['0 (3-hydrogenkwadaphnin)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Diterpenes)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '12133JR80S (Guanosine)', 'EC 1.1.1.205 (IMP Dehydrogenase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Radiation is used for curative therapy of locally advanced disease and is combined with additional anti-tumor agents to improve control. We determined the potential role of genistein as a radiosensitizer for cervical cancer cells. METHODS: Human cervical cell lines (CaSki and ME180) were used. Sensitivity of cells to genistein, radiation and the combination was determined by colony assays. Western blotting was used to study the expression of cell-response-related gene products. RESULTS: Genistein results in the dose-dependent inhibition of all cell lines (2.5-40.0 microM). Effect of genistein on the radiosensitivity of the two cervical tumor cells was variable. Me180 cells were more sensitive at 20 and 40 microM of genistein. At 40 microM, less than 5% of Me180 cells survived the radiation (200-800 cGy). Potentiation of the radiation effect in CaSki cells was seen (500-800 cGy). The most significant enhancement of radiosensitivity was seen at 20 and 40 microM genistein at 500 and 800 cGy. G(2)M arrest was demonstrated only in ME180 cells with genistein. There was significant inhibition of Mcl-1 by genistein that correlated with increase in radiosensitivity in Me180 cells. Activated pAKT (Thr 308) was inhibited with genistein and radiation in CaSki cells. CONCLUSIONS.: Genistein inhibits growth of cervical cancer cells. Genistein results in variable and significant enhancement of the radiation effect that may be partially mediated by G(2)M arrest, Mcl-1 and activation of the AKT gene.","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Isoflavones)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Radiation-Sensitizing Agents)', '6287WC5J2L (daidzein)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'DH2M523P0H (Genistein)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (AKT1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: All the ALL patients who were diagnosed at the hospital from October 1998 to June 2003 were analyzed. The data were extracted from the department's tumor registry database. Failure in protocol compliance and treatment was analyzed within different risk groups, patients' resident area, and time period. The patients who had not received any therapy after ALL diagnosis were accounted as early protocol compliance failure, those who received therapy for less than 15 days were regarded as interim failure in protocol compliance, and those who gave up therapy or were lost in follow-up after 15 days with stable disease or complete remission (CR) were accounted as late compliance failure. RESULTS: Totally 224 patients were diagnosed to have ALL, of them 38 patients went home without receiving any therapy, i.e., the rate of early protocol compliance failure was 17.1%. Of the remaining 186 patients, 22 (10.5%) belonged to interim protocol compliance failure, and 6 cases discontinued the therapy after 15 days treatment, who were classified into late compliance failure. Six cases (10.5%) were regarded as protocol compliance failure among 57 Shanghainese, and so were 22 cases (17.1%) out of 129 non-Shanghainese. There was no significant difference between the two groups (chi(2) = 1.332, P > 0.05). Up to a median 40 months follow-up showed that in 52 patients (31.7%) the treatment failed, of which 37 cases (22.6%) died of incomplete response and relapse, and 15 cases (9.5%) died of therapy complication. Among different risk groups, 24 cases (47.1%) came from high risk group, 18 (34.0%) from medium risk group, and 5 (9.4%) from low risk group. Very significant difference was found among the different risk group (chi(2) = 21.463, P < 0.01). Treatment failure was 28.6% (32/112) in non-Shanghainese and 38.5% (20/52) in Shanghainese. Total failure in protocol compliance and treatment was 42.9% (32 + 22/129) in non-Shanghainese and 45.6% (20 + 6/57) in Shanghainese. The difference of treatment failure was not significant different between the two groups (chi(2) = 1.354, P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Protocol compliance failure is the reason as important as the treatment failure for childhood ALL management failure. Either failure should not be neglected. Death from complications was relatively high which needs more attention, especially during induction period. Unusually high death rate occurred in high and medium risk group patients. The grouping criteria may need modification.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The objective of this study was to analyze the outcomes of 119 standard-risk childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (SR-ALL) patients, and explore how to improve the survival rate in ALL. METHODS: A total of 119 patients aged 14 months to 15 years were diagnosed as SR-ALL according to the Suggestion of Diagnosis And Treatment for Childhood Acute Leukemia-1993. Among them, seventy-nine were boys and 40 were girls. All of the patients were treated with the CCLG-97 protocol and were followed up for a period of 20 approximately 78 months. RESULTS: The complete remission rate reached 97.4% in four-week induction. Twenty-one patients were out of follow-up, comprising 63%, 14%, 10%, 8% and 5% of all subjects in 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001 and 2002, respectively. The overall survival rates were 93.3%, 90.2%, 88.0%, 85.0%, 85.0% and 85.0% in 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, 4 years and 5 years, respectively. Relapses occurred in 13 patients (13.8%). Among 9 isolated hematologic relapses, 5 patients (56%) were given irregular therapy, 2 did not reach CR within 4 weeks and relapsed 2 years later, 2 accepted regular therapy, 1 was of hypodiploidy and 1 T-ALL. Isolated central nervous system (CNS) relapse occurred in 4 patients (4.3%). Fifteen patients (12.6%) died, 5 of whom (4.2%) died of complications. CONCLUSION: Reinforcing administration and regular therapy are important to improve the long-term survival rate in childhood ALL. The clinical classification should be adjusted with the improvement of diagnostic methods. CCLG-97 protocol decreased the rate of the relapses in SR-ALL and didn't increase the rate of therapy-related death. High-dose methotrexate should be used in therapy and its dosage, usage and individualized therapeutic regimen should be further studied.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present study was designed to establish a flow cytometric method for detecting MRD in children with B-ALL and evaluate its clinical prognostic value. The investigators also aimed to study the value of the detection of MRD by flow cytometry in childhood B-ALL without effective antibody combinations. METHODS: Thirty-six cases of childhood B-ALL with effective antibody combinations were performed MRD analysis after induction therapy. The authors detected MRD in 6 cases without effective antibody combinations by the four-color antibody combinations consisting of CD(45)/CD(19)/CD(10)/CD(34) and CD(45)/CD(19)/CD(20)/CD(22) and detected the aberrance of the minor subsets of CD(19)(+) cells. RESULTS: (1) Forty-two cases of childhood B-ALL were screened for antibody combinations of interest and were identified in 86% (36/42) of the cases. The sensitivity of this method was 0.01%. (2) Patients with MRD levels > or = 0.01% at 9 and 12 months of therapy had significantly low disease-free survival compared with patients with MRD levels < 0.01%. (3) Six out of seven patients with recurrence in the BM had MRD levels > or = 0.1% prior to recurrence. Patients with MRD levels > or = 0.1% during chemotherapy had significantly low disease-free survival as compared with patients with MRD values < 0.1%. (4) Two out of seven patients with recurrence had positive results of the qualitative PCR prior to recurrence. (5) Five patients with recurrence had no shift of antigen expression at relapse except that a patient missed CD(13). (6) Detectable MRD was not found in six patients without effective antibody combinations. CONCLUSION: (1) Flow cytometry is a sensitive and specific method for detecting MRD of childhood ALL, and could predict the coming relapse. (2) Patients with MRD levels > 10(-3) had poor prognosis. (3) The levels of MRD at month 9 and 12 had prognostic value. (4) The value of antibody combinations consisting of CD(45)/CD(19)/CD(10)/CD(34) and CD(45)/CD(19)/CD(20)/CD(22) should be further investigated in patients without effective antibody combinations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Such compounds could serve as inhibitors of IgE binding to mast cell receptors. An alanine scan of MCD peptide reported previously showed that the analog [Ala12]MCD was 120-fold less potent in histamine-releasing activity and fivefold more potent in binding affinity to mast cell receptors than the parent MCD peptide. Because this analog showed marginal intrinsic activity and good binding affinity it was subsequently tested in the present study as an IgE inhibitor. In contrast to MCD peptide, [Ala12]MCD showed a 50% inhibition of IgE binding to the Fc epsilon RI alpha mast cell receptor by using rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) mast cells and fluorescence polarization. Furthermore, in a beta-hexosaminidase secretory assay, the peptide also showed a 50% inhibition of the secretion of this enzyme caused by IgE.

By modulating the acetylation status of histones, histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACIs) alter the transcription of genes involved in cell growth, maturation, survival and apoptosis, among other processes. Early clinical results suggest a potentially useful role for HDACIs in the treatment of certain forms of lymphoma (e.g., cutaneous T cell lymphoma) and acute leukaemia. An unresolved question is how HDACIs induce cell death in tumour cells. Recent studies suggest that acetylation of nonhistone proteins may play an important role in the biological effects of this class of compounds, and may explain lack of correlation between histone acetylation and induction of cell death by HDACIs in some circumstances. Recently, attention has focussed on the effects of HDACIs on disruption of co-repressor complexes, induction of oxidative injury, upregulation of the expression of death receptors, generation of lipid second messengers such as ceramide, interference with the function of chaperone proteins and modulation of the activity of NF-kappaB as critical determinants of lethality. Aside from providing critical insights into the mechanism of action of HDACIs in neoplastic disease, these findings may provide a foundation for the rational development of combination studies, involving HDACIs in combination with either conventional cytotoxic drugs as well as more novel targeted agents.","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)']",194,,,,"['CA61774/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA63753/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA93738/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, there is a substantial need for new antileukaemic drugs. Recent advances in the understanding of the molecular alterations in ALL have lead to the identification of new targets and the arrival of molecular-targeted therapies in the clinical setting. The prototype for this approach is the treatment of Philadelphia chromosome-positive ALL with imatinib mesylate. Here, the targeting of a molecular abnormality--inhibition of BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase--has turned a very poor-prognosis disease into one in which promising results are achieved. Promising new therapies are under development that target various goals, including the NOTCH signalling pathway, purine nucleoside phosphorylase activity, mammalian target of rapamycin and tyrosine kinase. This review outlines recent advances in the development of emerging drugs for the treatment of adult ALL. The recent advances in the understanding of the biology and pathogenesis of ALL have helped to determine prognosis and to plan the therapy of adult patients with ALL. Still, despite improved complete remission rates of 65-90% with current therapy, only 20-40% of patients can be considered cured. New therapeutic alternatives are needed to improve these results. With a better understanding of the disease, more target-specific therapies could be designed. The aim of this review is to highlight new pharmacotherapies and those emerging drug treatments for patients with adult ALL.","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Drugs, Investigational)']",162,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mucous membrane and skin are most common portals of entry for microorganisms in these patients. The aim of the present study was to find the prevalence of mucocutaneous findings infebrile neutropenic leukemic children. The authors prospectively examined children with fever with neutropenia in acute leukemia, aged 1-15 years, who were admitted to the Department of Pediatrics, King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, between September 2000 and August 2001. During the study period, 46 children had 116 admissions, 51 of which were due to febrile neutropenia. Their cancer diagnoses were ALL (76%) and ANLL (24%). The prevalence of mucocutaneous findings was 86% (61% were from infections, 22% from mucositis and 4% from chemical phlebitis). Other detected sites of infection were lower respiratory tract (36%), urinary tract (32%), upper respiratory tract (11%), septicemia (11%) and unidentified (35%). Thirty-four percent of the patients had more than one site of infection. Gram-negative septicemia was the most common infection (15cases/71%) followed by gram positive (4cases/19%) and candida (2cases/10%). The prevalence of infection was found in severe neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count, ANC less than 500 cell/cu mm), moderate neutropenia (ANC, 500-1000 cell/cu mm) and mild neutropenia (ANC, 1001-1500 cell/cu mm) was 72%, 9% and 5%, respectively. Infection in patients in the severe neutropenia group was significantly more common than in moderate mild neutropenia groups (p < 0.01). Seven patients (15%) died, all of them had severe and prolonged neutropenia, for more than 7 days. Daily physical examination of skin and mucous membrane are suggested for proper and prompt diagnosis and treatment of febrile neutropenic children with acute leukemia to reduce mortality and morbidity in these patients. A Guideline for the use of antimicrobial agents in neutropenic patients with acute leukemia is proposed In conclusion, infection was commonly found in severe neutropenia. Mucocutaneous infection was the most common site of infection infebrile neutropenia in children with leukemia.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Immunization of GT0 mice with BSA conjugated to alphaGal (alphaGal-BSA) led to significant production of anti-BSA IgG antibodies without the need for adjuvant. This response was dependent on the presence of alphaGal-reactive antibodies. Immunization of wild-type mice with alphaGal-BSA failed to induce an anti-BSA response. The presence of alphaGal-reactive antibodies also led to an increase in the T cell response to BSA following immunization with alphaGal-BSA when compared with mice that received BSA alone, resulting in an increased frequency of IFN-gamma- and IL-4-producing BSA-specific T cells. In addition, the ability to produce alphaGal-reactive antibodies enhanced the cytotoxic T lymphocyte anti-viral antigen response following vaccination with murine leukemia virus transformed cell lines that express alphaGal on their cell surface.

Consistent results were obtained from multiple human donors.

Furthermore, sustained transgene expression was demonstrated in long-term cryopreserved transfected cells. This simple and rapid gene delivery technology has been validated under the current Good Manufacturing Practice conditions, and multiple doses of CD154-expressing cells were prepared for CLL patients from one DNA transfection.

Normally KIT is activated (phosphorylated) by binding of its ligand, the stem cell factor. This leads to a phosphorylation cascade ultimately activating various transcription factors in different cell types. Such activation regulates apoptosis, cell differentiation, proliferation, chemotaxis, and cell adhesion. KIT-dependent cell types include mast cells, some hematopoietic stem cells, germ cells, melanocytes, and Cajal cells of the gastrointestinal tract, and neoplasms of these cells are examples of KIT-positive tumors. Other KIT-positive normal cells include epithelial cells in skin adnexa, breast, and subsets of cerebellar neurons. KIT positivity has been variably reported in sarcomas such as angiosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma, synovial sarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, and MFH; results of the last three are controversial. The variations in published data may result from incomplete specificity of some polyclonal antibodies, possibly contributed by too high dilutions. Also, KIT is expressed in pulmonary and other small cell carcinomas, adenoid cystic carcinoma, renal chromophobe carcinoma, thymic, and some ovarian and few breast carcinomas. A good KIT antibody reacts with known KIT positive cells, and smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts are negative. KIT deficiency due to hereditary nonsense/missense mutations leads to disruption of KIT-dependent functions such as erythropoiesis, skin pigmentation, fertility, and gastrointestinal motility. Conversely, pathologic activation of KIT through gain-of-function mutations leads to neoplasia of KIT-dependent and KIT-positive cell types at least in three different systems: mast cells/myeloid cells--mastocytosis/acute myeloid leukemia, germ cells--seminoma, and Cajal cells--gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs). KIT tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as imatinib mesylate are the generally accepted treatment of metastatic GISTs, and their availability has prompted an active search for other treatment targets among KIT-positive tumors such as myeloid leukemias and small cell carcinoma of the lung, with variable and often nonconvincing results.",['EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)'],239,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ig genes are rearranged in B cells using the same enzyme machinery. TCRD (TCR delta) genes are frequently incompletely rearranged in B precursor leukemias and recently were found in a significant portion of physiological B lymphocytes. Incomplete TCRD rearrangements (V-D) thus serve as natural indicators of previous V(D)J recombinase activity. Functional V(D)J recombinase has recently been found in murine NK precursors. We tested whether physiological NK cells and other leukocyte subpopulations contained TCR rearrangements in humans. This would provide evidence that V(D)J recombinase was active in the ancestry cells and suggest common pathways among the positive cell types. TCRD were rearranged in 3.2-36% of NK cells but not in nonlymphoid leukocytes. The previously known phenomenon of TCRD transcription in NK cells is a possible mechanism that maintains the chromatin open at the TCRD locus. In comparison, TCRG rearrangements were frequent in T cells, low to negative in B and NK cells, and negative in nonlymphoid cells, suggesting a tighter control of TCRG. Levels of TCRD rearrangements were similar among the B lymphocyte subsets (B1-B2, naive-memory). In conclusion, human NK cells pass through a differentiation step with active V(D)J recombinase similar to T and B lymphocytes and unlike nonlymphoid leukocytes. This contradicts recent challenges to the concept of separate lymphoid and myeloid differentiation.","['0 (Genetic Markers)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (VDJ Recombinases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mutation of the evolutionary conserved amino acid D419 within the extracellular domain was sufficient to constitutively activate the KIT receptor, although high expression levels were required. Dose-dependent growth inhibition and apoptosis were observed using either the protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate (STI571, Gleevec) or by blocking the phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT pathway.

Their poor ability to present antigens to the T cells, largely due to an inadequate costimulatory capacity, is manifested as a failure to stimulate proliferation of both allogeneic and autologous T cells. We have investigated the ability of in vitro manipulated CLL cells, via hyperexpression of a triad of costimulatory molecules (B7-1, intercellular adhesion molecule 1 [ICAM-1], and leukocyte-function-associated antigen 3 [LFA-3], designated TRICOM), to stimulate effective antitumor T-cell responses. A recombinant modified vaccinia virus strain Ankara (MVA), which is a highly attenuated, replication-impaired virus variant, was successfully used to infect and deliver the simultaneous expression of the 3 human costimulatory molecules in TRICOM on the surface of the CLL cells. Proliferation of allogeneic and autologous T cells was observed when MVA-TRICOM-infected CLL cells were used as stimulators in proliferation assays. Cytotoxic T lymphocytes, generated in vitro by stimulation of autologous T cells with MVA-TRICOM-infected CLL cells, showed cytotoxicity against unmodified/uninfected CLL cells. Therefore, our findings suggest that the use of CLL cells infected ex vivo with MVA-TRICOM or direct injection of MVA-TRICOM in patients with CLL has potential for the immunotherapy of CLL.","['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Cancer Vaccines)']",,20050804,,,"['Z01 BC010425-06/BC/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'Z01 BC010427-06/BC/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC1895050,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To analyze the role of MN1-TEL in leukemogenesis, we created a site-directed transgenic (knock-in) mouse model carrying a conditional MN1-TEL transgene under the control of the Aml1 regulatory sequences. After induction, MN1-TEL expression was detected in both myeloid and lymphoid cells. Activation of MN1-TEL expression enhanced the repopulation ability of myeloid progenitors in vitro as well as partially inhibited their differentiation in vivo. MN1-TEL also promoted the proliferation of thymocytes while it blocked their differentiation from CD4-/CD8- to CD4+/CD8+ in vivo. After long latency, 30% of the MN1-TEL-positive mice developed T-lymphoid tumors. This process was accelerated by N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea-induced mutations. MN1-TEL-positive T-lymphoid tumors showed elevated expression of the Notch-1, Hes-1, c-Myc, and Lmo-2 genes while their Ink4a/pRB and Arf/p53 pathways were impaired, suggesting that these alterations cooperatively transform T progenitors. We conclude that MN1-TEL exerts its nonlineage-specific leukemogenic effects by promoting the growth of primitive progenitors and blocking their differentiation, but cooperative mutations are necessary to fully induce leukemic transformation.","['0 (MN1-TEL fusion protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",,20050804,,,"['CA217G/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA72999-07/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC1895241,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Data from our laboratory and others suggest that alterations in antioxidant defense enzyme levels and redox environment can be oncogenic and affect the response to glucocorticoid treatment, one of the components of combination chemotherapy regimens for lymphoma. The goal of the current study was to reanalyze the LLMPP microarray data to determine whether the levels of antioxidant defense enzymes and redox proteins were correlated with prognosis in DLBCL. We found that patients with DLBCL with the worst prognosis, according to the outcome predictor score, had decreased expression of catalase, glutathione peroxidase, manganese superoxide dismutase, and VDUP1, a protein that inhibits thioredoxin activity.

Conventional ESC culture methods are impractical for large-scale cell production and lack robust microenvironmental control. We developed two stirred-suspension culture systems for the propagation of undifferentiated ESCs--microcarrier and aggregate cultures--and compared them with tissue-culture flask and Petri dish controls. ESCs cultured on glass microcarriers had population doubling times (approximately 14-17 hours) comparable to tissue-culture flask controls. ESC growth could be elicited in shear-controlled stirred-suspension culture, with population doubling times ranging between 24 and 39 hours at 100 rpm impeller speed. Upon removal of leukemia inhibitory factor, the size-controlled ESC aggregates developed into embryoid bodies (EBs) capable of multilineage differentiation. A comprehensive analysis of ESC developmental potential, including flow cytometry for Oct-4, SSEA-1, and E-cadherinprotein expression, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction for Flk-1, HNF3-beta, MHC, and Sox-1 gene expression, and EB differentiation analysis, demonstrated that the suspension-cultured ESCs retained the developmental potential of the starting cell population.

This study was undertaken to gain a better understanding of the attitudes of dentists enrolled in postgraduate training toward AIDS and homosexuals. Each respondent received a 500-word patient case vignette and two scales for recording impressions of the person described in the vignette. There were four vignettes, identical except that the portrayed individual's illness was identified as either AIDS or leukemia and sexual preference as either homosexual or heterosexual. Two-way analyses of variance and t tests (p<.05) revealed a bias toward individuals with AIDS and toward homosexuals. Respondents reacted more negatively to both groups on the Social Interaction Scale as seen in total scale scores as well as to individual scale items. In addition, although overall Prejudicial Evaluation Scale scores displayed no evidence of bias, several individual scale items did. It is important to ensure that dentists' attitudes toward patients with AIDS and homosexuals are not a barrier to these patients receiving the best possible care. Therefore, dental education programs at all levels should give consideration to interventions to address provider attitudes and potential biases.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Of the study participants, 1,092 were employed at four Department of Energy sites where plutonium-bearing materials were processed or stored. Exposures were assessed by first categorising exposure potentials based on available bioassay data, then estimating doses for workers in the highest categories using recent recommendations of the International Commission on Radiological Protection. Given the aetiology of leukaemia, equivalent dose to active bone marrow was chosen as the exposure variable. There were 556 workers each with at least one plutonium bioassay result, assigned to one of three evaluation categories. Dose estimates were made for 115 workers resulting in a collective equivalent dose of 2.1 person-Sv for 2,822 exposure-years, compared with 29.8 person-Sv estimated from photon exposures.

Until now, autoimmunity in cancer has been mainly revealed in solid tumors. The aim of this study was to apply the proteomic approach to the identification of proteins that commonly elicit a humoral response in acute leukemia (AL). Sera from 21 newly diagnosed patients with AL, 20 patients with solid tumors, and 22 noncancer controls were analyzed for antibody-based reactivity against AL proteins resolved by two-dimensional electrophoresis. As a result, autoantibody against a protein identified by mass spectrometry as Rho GDP dissociation inhibitor 2 was detected in sera from 15 of 21 patients with AL (71%). By contrast, such antibody was detected in sera from one of 20 patients with solid tumors (5%) and one of 22 noncancer controls (4.5%). Five other protein autoantibodies were also found in AL patients with a high frequency and constituted the major target antigens of the AL autoimmune response. The findings of autoantibodies against Rho GDP dissociation inhibitor 2 and other proteins in sera of patients with AL suggest that the proteomic approach we have implemented may have utility for the development of a serum-based assay for AL screening and diagnosis.","['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Autoantibodies)', '0 (Guanine Nucleotide Dissociation Inhibitors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (rho-Specific Guanine Nucleotide Dissociation Inhibitors)']",,20050804,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To better understand how these secondary chromosomal aberrations occur and to investigate whether the p185/p190 BCR-ABL fusion protein may directly induce an increased chromosomal instability and subsequently the appearance of clonal chromosome aberrations, three BRC-ABL (p185/ p190)-transduced mouse pre-B cell lines were analyzed by spectral karyotyping and fluorescence in situ hybridization. The human wild-type BCR-ABL gene was expressed at a level comparable with that in human Ph-positive leukemias at diagnosis. All BCR-ABL-transduced cell lines acquired similar clonal chromosomal aberrations. Trisomy 5 was always present, followed by loss of the Y chromosome, trisomy of chromosomes 12 and 18, and an unbalanced translocation between chromosomes X and 12. Thus, ectopic p185/p190 BCR-ABL expression, such as p210 BCR-ABL, PML-RARA, or C-MYC transduction, may induce an increased chromosomal instability leading to clonal karyotypic evolution, which may mimic secondary chromosome aberrations in human Ph-positive ALL.","['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, there was no statistical difference between the two groups in the CR rate post first course of chemotherapy, CR rate and the effective rate of treatment. (2) Use of G-CSF did not affect CR durations of ALL patients, but shortened that of AML patients. (3) The application of G-CSF had little effect on the lifespan of ALL patients. By contrast, it showed clearly negative effects on that of AML patients. (4) No relationship between the dosage of G-CSF and CR duration or lifespan in AML patients.

Pathway specific analyses of gene-gene correlations across these datasets remain relatively unexplored, though they could be informative. METHODS: Folate gene expression data is explored here in two ways: (1) directly, using gene-gene scatter plots and gene expression time course plots; and (2) indirectly, using de novo purine synthesis (DNPS) and de novo thymidylate synthesis (DNTS) flux predictions of a folate model perturbed by relative gene expression modulations of its Vmax parameters. RESULTS: Positive correlations within and between the DNPS and DNTS folate cycles are observed in the folate gene expression data. For steady state measurements across childhood leukemia patients, positive correlations between DNPS and DNTS are consistent with higher proliferative fractions requiring higher levels of both fluxes. For cells exposed to ionizing radiation, transient increases in both pathways are consistent with DNA damage driven dNTP demand, and a steadily decreasing backdrop is consistent with radiation induced cell cycle arrest. By and large, folate model based flux predictions paralleled these findings, the main differences being a gain of correlation information for the TEL-AML1 leukemia data, and the loss of one interesting inference, namely, that RNA repair driven DNPS precedes DNA repair driven DNTS after a 10 gray dose of ionizing radiation. CONCLUSION: Pathway focused correlation analyses of DNA microarray data can be informative, with or without a mathematical model. Conceptual models are essential. Mathematical model based analyses should supplement, but should not replace, direct data analyses.","['0 (Purines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)', 'EC 2.1.1.45 (Thymidylate Synthase)']",,20050804,,,"['K25 CA104791/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U56 CA112963/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA043703/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1K25 CA104791-01A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P20 CA112963-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA43703/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC1198223,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DRB3 is the most polymorphic bovine MHC class II gene which encodes the peptide-binding groove. DRB3 gene has been extensively evaluated as a candidate marker for association with various bovine diseases and immunological traits. This study describes genetic variability in the BoLA-DRB3 in Iranian Holstein cattle. This is the first study of the DNA polymorphism of the BoLA-DRB3 gene in Iranian Holstein cattle. Hemi-nested PCR-RFLP method is used for identification the frequency of BoLA-DRB3 alleles. The BoLA-DRB3 locus is highly polymorphic in the studied herd (26 alleles). Almost 67% of the alleles were accounted for four alleles (BoLA-DRB3.2*8, *24, *11 and *16) in Iranian Holstein cattle. The DRB3.2*8 allele frequency (26.6%) was higher than the others. The frequencies of the DRB3.2*54, *37, *36, *28, *25, *14, *13, *10, *1 alleles were lower than 1%. Significant distinctions have been found between Iranian Holstein cattle and other cattle breeds studied. In Iranian Holstein cattle the alleles (BoLA-DRB3.2*22, *2 and *16) associated with a lower risk of cystic ovarian disease in Holstein cattle are found. The alleles associated with the resistance to mastitis and to bovine leukemia virus infection BoLA-DRB3.2*11 and *23 are detected with the frequencies 10.4% and 4.4%, respectively.

The right tibia was irradiated at a total dose of 60 Gy, and the left tibia was irradiated at a total dose of 40 Gy. The left tibia developed MFH and the right tibia developed OS. RESULTS: Telomere reduction (MFH 70.2, OS 70.0%) and high telomerase activities (MFH 12.1, OS 17.7 TPG) were observed. These results reflect an aggressive feature of postradiation sarcomas.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In order to study apoptotic signal transduction of gastric cancer cells, MKN45 gastric cancer cells expressing the wild-type p53 gene and U937 myeloid leukemia cells expressing a mutated p53 gene were prepared. Cisplatin (CDDP) was used to induce apoptosis. We compared apoptotic signal transduction downstream to mitochondria between those two lines. RESULTS: In contrast to U937 cells, MKN45 gastric cancer cells revealed delayed response in release of mitochondrial cytochrome c into the cytosol following caspase 3 activation. In signal pathways downstream of caspase 3 cleavage, of the three substrates detected, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and PKC (protein kinase c) delta were not activated in MKN45 cells compared with U937 cells, resulting in delayed appearance of DNA ladder formation during CDDP-induced apoptosis. MKN45 constitutively expressed cLAP1, regardless of CDDP treatment, compared with no expression in U937 Drug sensitivity testing showed that MKN45 was more resistant to CDDP than U937 cells. CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that there is a delayed mitochondrial response and incomplete activation of caspase 3 in MKN45 gastric cancer cells compared with U937 leukemia cells. In addition, there was endogenous cLAP1 expression in MKN45 cells, which may be a factor in the presumed anti-apoptotic system in these human gastric cancer cells.","['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (caspase-activated DNase inhibitor)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (PRKCD protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C-delta)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: The resistant cell lines clustered together based on their type of origin. Several genes encoding ABC transporters were highly up-regulated, most notably ABCB1 (MDR1) and ABCB4 in several cell lines and ABCG2 (MXR) specifically in MX-resistant cell lines. A pronounced down-regulation of several histones was noted in the MCF-7-derived resistant sublines. Altered expression was also seen in, e.g., GSTs, topoisomerases, caveolins, annexins and CD44.

In this study, seven cases of MS [stomach (1), testis (1), skin (2), and lymph node (3)] and 3 synchronous and 1 follow-up bone marrow (BM) samples were studied for genomic abnormalities using array comparative genomic hybridization (array-CGH). Array-CGH construction used approximately 5,400 bacterial artificial chromosome clones from the RPCI-11 library, spanning the human genome. Data were analyzed using the DNAcopy software and custom heuristics. All MS cases had genomic abnormalities detected by array-CGH. Unbalanced genomic abnormalities in five MS cases were confirmed by conventional cytogenetics (CC) and/or fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH); these abnormalities included loss of 4q32.1-q35.2, 6q16.1-q21, and 12p12.2-p13.2 and gain of 8q21.2-q24.3, 8, 11q21-q25, 13q21.32-q34, 19, and 21.

The remaining two MS cases had genomic aberrations detected by array-CGH, but were not studied further by CC/FISH. Chromosome 8 was most commonly abnormal (3/7 cases).

In this study, we have examined the possible alterations of these genes in 58 mantle cell lymphomas (MCLs) and 4 MCL-related cell lines. Aurora-A was also examined in 46 diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCLs). Aurora-A and hMPS1 mRNA expression levels were related to tumor proliferative activity. Interestingly, a MCL case with the highest number or chromosomal imbalances also showed an extremely high value of Aurora-A mRNA expression. No Aurora-A gene amplifications were detected in any tumor or cell line, whereas hemizygous hMPS1 gene deletions were observed in 23% of MCLs and 3 of the 4 cell lines. However, no expression alterations or gene mutations were detected in these cases. The Aurora-A proposed cancer susceptibility polymorphic variant (P31I) was observed with a similar frequency in MCL, DLBCL, chronic lymphocytic leukemia and in the 431 healthy controls. However, the 3 MCLs and 4 DLBCLs with the homozygous variant of this polymorphism had particular clinical characteristics with an unusual early-age presentation and second epithelial malignancies in MCL and extranodal origin in DLBCL. These findings indicate that Aurora-A and hMPS1 aberrations are uncommon in aggressive lymphomas but Aurora-A overexpression may contribute to numerical chromosomal alterations in occasional MCL. Although the Aurora-A P31I polymorphic variant is not directly involved in a genetic predisposition to these lymphomas, it may modulate the clinical presentation of these tumors.","['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Aurora Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.12.1 (TTK protein, human)']",,,"['Copyright 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2005 Aug 2.,"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and other B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders (LPDs) show clear evidence of familial aggregation, but the inherited basis is largely unknown. To identify a susceptibility gene for CLL, we conducted a genomewide linkage analysis of 115 pedigrees, using a high-density single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array containing 11,560 markers. Multipoint linkage analyses were undertaken using both nonparametric (model-free) and parametric (model-based) methods. Our results confirm that the presence of high linkage disequilibrium (LD) between SNP markers can lead to inflated nonparametric linkage (NPL) and LOD scores. After the removal of high-LD SNPs, we obtained a maximum NPL of 3.14 (P=.0008) on chromosome 11p11. The same genomic position also yielded the highest multipoint heterogeneity LOD (HLOD) score under both dominant (HLOD 1.95) and recessive (HLOD 2.78) models. In addition, four other chromosomal positions (5q22-23, 6p22, 10q25, and 14q32) displayed HLOD scores >1.15 (which corresponds to a nominal P value <.01). None of the regions coincided with areas of common chromosomal abnormalities frequently observed for CLL. These findings strengthen the argument for an inherited predisposition to CLL and related B-cell LPDs.",,,20050802,,,,PMC1226207,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2005 Jul 22.,"BACKGROUND: There is little information on the timing, magnitude, specificity, and clinical relevance of the antibody response to acute hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. We investigated the specificity, titer, and neutralizing potential of antibody responses to acute infection by examining 12 injection drug users before, during, and after infection. METHODS: Seroconversion was defined as incident detection of HCV-specific antibodies by using a commercially available enzyme-linked immuosorbent assay (ELISA). HCV protein-specific antibody responses were measured using recombinant antigens in an ELISA. For neutralization assays, plasma was incubated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-HCV H77 or control HIV-murine leukemia virus (MLV) pseudotype virus and then allowed to infect Hep3B hepatoma cells. RESULTS: The mean time to HCV seroconversion was 6 weeks after the onset of viremia. Antibody responses to nonstructural proteins were detected before responses to the structural proteins, and antibodies to both were primarily restricted to the immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) subclass. The maximum median end point titers for antibody responses to structural and nonstructural proteins were 1 : 600 and 1 : 6400, respectively. Antibodies that neutralized a retroviral pseudotype bearing HCV 1a envelope glycoproteins were detected at seroconversion in only 1 subject and at 6-8 months after seroconversion in 3 subjects. The delayed appearance of neutralizing antibodies was consistent with the late development of antibodies specific for the viral envelope glycoproteins, which are believed to mediate virus neutralization. CONCLUSION: The humoral immune response to acute HCV infection is of relatively low titer, is restricted primarily to the IgG1 subclass, and is delayed. A better understanding of why production of neutralizing antibody is delayed may improve efforts to prevent HCV infection.","['0 (Hepatitis C Antibodies)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Viral Proteins)']",,20050722,,,"['R21 DK068555/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'U19 AI040035/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'U19 AI40035/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'G0400802/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'K08 DA016535-01/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We studied 35 patients, who received thalidomide at a dose of 200 mg/daily. We measured, pre-, 3 and 6 months post-treatment soluble receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappaB ligand (sRANKL), osteoprotegerin (OPG), osteopontin (OPN), markers of bone resorption and formation. Before treatment, patients had increased levels of sRANKL/OPG ratio, bone resorption markers and OPN, while they had suppressed bone formation. The pretreatment sRANKL/OPG ratio correlated with the extent of bone disease. Thal/Dex administration resulted in a significant reduction of sRANKL/OPG ratio, and bone resorption. Bone formation, OPG and OPN did not show any alteration. Changes of sRANKL/OPG ratio correlated with changes of bone resorption markers. Thal/Dex was given for a median time of 10 months and the median follow-up period was 22 months. The response rate was 65.7%. The median survival was 19.5 months. beta2-microglobulin, type of response and International Staging System predicted for survival. These results suggest that the combination of intermediate dose of Thal/Dex is effective in patients with refractory/relapsed myeloma and improves abnormal bone remodeling through the reduction of sRANKL/OPG ratio.","['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Osteoprotegerin)', '0 (Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (SPP1 protein, human)', '0 (Sialoglycoproteins)', '0 (TNFRSF11B protein, human)', '106441-73-0 (Osteopontin)', '4Z8R6ORS6L (Thalidomide)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

NPMc+ AML accounts for about 35% of adult AML and it is associated with normal karyotype, wide morphological spectrum, CD34-negativity, high frequency of FLT3-ITD mutations and good response to induction therapy. In an attempt to identify a human cell line to serve as a model for the in vitro study of NPMc+ AML, we screened 79 myeloid cell lines for mutations at exon-12 of NPM. One of these cell lines, OCI/AML3, showed a TCTG duplication at exon-12 of NPM. This mutation corresponds to the type A, the NPM mutation most frequently observed in primary NPMc+ AML. OCI/AML3 cells also displayed typical phenotypic features of NPMc+ AML, that is, expression of macrophage markers and lack of CD34, and the immunocytochemical hallmark of this leukemia subtype, that is, the aberrant cytoplasmic expression of NPM. The OCI/AML3 cell line easily engrafts in NOD/SCID mice and maintains in the animals the typical features of NPMc+ AML, such as the NPM cytoplasmic expression. For all these reasons, the OCI/AML3 cell line represents a remarkable tool for biomolecular studies of NPMc+ AML.","['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The anti-allergic activities were assessed by measurement of histamine release from rat basophilic leukemia cells, RBL-2H3. Curcumin and tetrahydrocurcumin (THC) caused a marked decrease in histamine release. Glycosides of curcumin, bis-demethoxycurcumin and THC also inhibited the release of histamine, though less potently than curcumin did. The anti-oxidative activities were assessed by measurement of cell-free or cellular radical scavenging. All compounds but diglycosides or bis-demethoxycurcumin analogs distinctly exerted anti-oxidative effects. The relationship between both of these activities revealed that all compounds with potent radical scavenging activities caused a definite decrease in histamine release, but some compounds with non-potent radical scavenging activities also inhibited the histamine release. These results suggest that the hydroxy groups of curcumin play a significant role in exerting both the anti-oxidative and anti-allergic activities, and that most of the compounds develop the anti-allergic activities through mechanisms related to anti-oxidative activities, but some through mechanisms unrelated to anti-oxidation activity.","['0 (Anti-Allergic Agents)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '11028-71-0 (Concanavalin A)', '37H9VM9WZL (Calcimycin)', 'IT942ZTH98 (Curcumin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Xanthoangelol concentration-dependently reduced the survival rates of both cell lines as revealed by the trypan blue exclusion test. Early apoptosis induced by 4 h incubation with xanthoangelol was detected using flow cytometry after double-staining with annexin V and propidium iodide (PI). Western blot analysis showed that xanthoangelol markedly reduced the level of precursor caspase-3 and increased the level of cleaved caspase-3, but Bax and Bcl-2 proteins were not affected. These results suggest that xanthoangelol induces apoptotic cell death by activatation of caspase-3 in neuroblastoma and leukemia cells through a mechanism that does not involve Bax/Bcl-2 signal transduction.

When reviewing the current list of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, it becomes clear that these can be grouped into four classes of mutations, which are involved in: (i) cell cycle deregulation; (ii) impaired differentiation; (iii) proliferation and survival advantage and (iv) unlimited self-renewal capacity. Based on recent studies of T-ALL, we can speculate that at least these four different mutations are required for the development of T-ALL. In this review we summarize our current insights into the molecular pathogenesis of T-ALL, and we discuss how these molecular findings provide new directions for future research and novel therapeutic strategies in T-ALL.",['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)'],129,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Little is known about the best treatment schedule, and there are no data concerning hematologic parameters and cellular compositions of products during the treatment. DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a single-center study of 27 patients treated with ECP for corticoresistant GVHD. Treatment was given in a short-term series of six courses over 3 weeks, and in case of response, consolidation treatment was given until complete response or stabilization of lesions. RESULTS: Nine out of 12 patients with acute GVHD responded to treatment. In patients with chronic GVHD, 13 out of 15 patients responded (11 complete and 2 partial responses). Responses were obtained essentially in skin or gut lesions; ECP was of particular effect in three cases of bronchiolitis obliterans associated with transplantation, with all three patients responding. Hematologic consequences were studied in patients with chronic GVHD: hemoglobin levels increased significantly after treatment and a reduction in red blood cell transfusion requirements was also observed. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: ECP is effective in both chronic and acute GVHD, particularly in lung forms. ECP can reduce the duration of immunosuppressive therapy and improve erythroid recovery.

The aim of this study was to analyze whether the methylation status of the ZAP-70 gene is associated with expression of the ZAP-70 protein. DESIGN AND METHODS: Patients with CLL (n=87), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n=13), mantle cell leukemia (n=13) and splenic marginal zone lymphoma (n=14) of known immunoglobulin gene mutation (IgVH) status were studied. The methylation status of the 5' region of ZAP-70 was analyzed by combined bisulphite restriction analysis (COBRA), southern blotting and bisulphite sequencing in 10 CLL patients and in normal T/NK and B cells. Further COBRA of a single CpG site located 334bp downstream of the ZAP-70 transcription start site (C-334) was then performed on all patients. RESULTS: ZAP-70 expression status in CLL and normal peripheral blood lymphocytes is associated with the methylation status of the intron1-exon2 boundary region of ZAP-70 and methylation status of C-334 determined by COBRA is representative of methylation in this region. Of 87 CLL patients, 51/53 ZAP-70 negative patients had methylation at C-334 and 30/32 ZAP-70 positive patients did not have methylation (p<0.0001); a similar association was seen in all other diseases. Median survivals of methylated and unmethylated CLL patients were 211 and 85 months, respectively (p<0.0001). INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Measuring ZAP-70 methylation status at C-334 is a simple and reproducible method for predicting prognosis in CLL, which is closely associated with ZAP-70 expression and IgVH gene mutational status. Methylation of a highly conserved intronic region of ZAP-70 may be responsible for regulation of expression in normal and neoplastic cells.","[""0 (5' Untranslated Regions)"", '0 (Dinucleoside Phosphates)', ""2382-65-2 (cytidylyl-3'-5'-guanosine)"", 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)']",,,,['Haematologica. 2005 Aug;90(8):1012.

Hence, we evaluated the feasibility of generating in vitro antileukemic immune responses, which would bypass the need for epitope identification and rely on antigen presentation by autologous dendritic cells. DESIGN AND METHODS: Naturally processed peptides were extracted by acid elution from circulating AML cells of six patients at diagnosis. Mature dendritic cells (mDC) were derived from autologous monocytes obtained when the patients were in complete remission, and were loaded with the pool of eluted peptides to stimulate autologous T lymphocytes in vitro. RESULTS: We were able to induce in vitro antileukemic Th1 responses characterized by CD4(+) T-cell proliferation, significant interferon-gamma secretion by both CD4+ and CD8(+) T lymphocytes by recognition of autologous AML cells and generation of cytotoxic CD8(+) T lymphocytes. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that naturally processed peptides eluted from AML cells and presented by differentiated autologous mDC could be immunogenic in vitro. Although more in vitro data will be needed to check the safety of such an approach, notably to rule out possible autoimmune adverse effects, these results lay the basis for a potentially effective antileukemic immunotherapy for high-risk AML patients with minimal residual disease.","['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)']",,,,['Haematologica. 2005 Aug;90(8):1010C.

DESIGN AND METHODS: Immunocompetent and SCID mice were examined for their ability to survive a challenge of APL cells. We also vaccinated immunocompetent mice with DNA vaccines encoding various portions of a bcr-1 PML-RARa fusion protein. RESULTS: In genetically compatible, immunocompetent animals, APL cells routinely engrafted and caused lethal leukemia; however, immunodeficient SCID mice required approximately 100-fold fewer APL cells to cause lethal disease. Massive doses of APL cells were efficiently eliminated in allogeneic recipients. Vaccination with a plasmid expressing a human PML-RARa cDNA conferred protection against leukemic cells in vivo; mice vaccinated with the human PML portion of the fusion gene demonstrated similar protection. Analysis of 10-mer peptides spanning the t(15;17) translocation-associated PML-RARa fusion breakpoint suggested that they were not involved in the generation of immune responses. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: These data show that tumor-specific immune clearance of APL cells does occur in mice. In this model system, the relevant immunogenic antigens may arise from the xenogenic PML portion of human PML-RARa, and not unique sequences derived from the breakpoint region. However, the study proves that APL cells are capable of being recognized and killed in vivo by adaptive immune responses, suggesting that therapeutic vaccines should be possible for this disease when relevant tumor-specific antigens are identified.","['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Vaccines, DNA)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)']",,,,['Haematologica. 2005 Aug;90(8):1010B.

Although several studies have addressed this issue, the clinical influence of blood group differences on transfusion requirements and survival is still discussed controversially, especially in the case of PBPCT. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: This single-center study is based on 143 patients receiving PBPCT after standard or reduced-intensity conditioning. The influence of blood group differences in the ABO, Rh, and Kell systems on red blood cell, platelet, and plasma transfusion requirements; length of hospitalization in transplantation unit; survival; and occurrence of graft-versus-host disease was investigated. Additionally, the influence of the conditioning regimen and irregular antibodies on the measures mentioned above was analyzed. RESULTS: Multivariate analysis demonstrated that minor and bidirectional ABO mismatch (p = 0.028) and Rh difference (p = 0.020) independently led to poorer survival. The Kell difference did not show significant influences on the measures mentioned above. A clinically relevant influence of blood group differences on transfusion requirements could not be demonstrated. Irregular antibodies also did not show significant influences. CONCLUSION: These findings indicate an influence of blood group differences in PBPCT on survival and must be studied in further detail.","['0 (ABO Blood-Group System)', '0 (Blood Group Antigens)', '0 (Isoantibodies)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, the anticancer activities of these compounds correlated with their ability to target topo II mediated genomic DNA damage in vivo. Compounds 1 and 3 with 2,6-dideoxy sugars produced more covalent topo-DNA complex than compounds with 2-deoxy sugar (6) and 6-deoxy sugar (7). Compounds with an alpha-configuration of terminal 2,6-dideoxy sugar (compounds 1 and 3) showed higher topo II poisoning than their counterparts with the beta-configuration (compounds 2 and 4). These results indicate that sugar moieties in daunorubicin play a significant role in its anticancer activity and topo II inhibition. The second sugar of disaccharide daunorubicin should possess 2,6-dideoxy with alpha-linkage to the first sugar to exhibit better anticancer activity.","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Disaccharides)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Additionally, MDP-C increases the expression levels of several surface molecules, including CD11c, MHC class I, and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 in BMDCs. Moreover, MDP-C remarkably enhances the immune system's responsiveness to hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) in hepatitis B virus transgenic mice for both antibody production and specific HBsAg T-cell responses ex vivo.

RESULTS: In two Philadelphia (Ph)-positive ALL cell lines, AMN107 was found to be 30-40 times more potent than imatinib in inhibiting cellular proliferation. AMN107 was also more effective than imatinib in inhibiting phosphorylation of p190 Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase in cell lines and primary ALL cells. The inhibition of cellular proliferation was associated with the induction of apoptosis in only one of the cell lines. No activity was observed in cell lines lacking the BCR-ABL genotype.

In the current report, a large cohort of childhood cancer survivors was used to: (1) describe twin concordance patterns for a range of cancers, (2) calculate the standardized incidence rates of cancers in twins, and (3) describe clinical features and outcomes of concordant twins. PROCEDURE: Cancer family history was obtained on the 211 twins participating in the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS) (14,352 participants surviving > or =5 years after a malignancy diagnosed at <21 years during January 1, 1970-December 31, 1986) to calculate probandwise twin concordance rates and standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) using Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End-Results data. RESULTS: Seven monozygotic twin pairs were concordant for cancer (six for leukemia, one for non-Hodgkin lymphoma), yielding probandwise concordance rates of 9.5%, 20.7%, and 20.0% for all cancer, leukemia, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), respectively. No concordance was observed among dizygotic twins or for dissimilar cancers. The SIR in monozygotic twins was 23.3 (95% CI = 11.1-48.9) for all cancer, 112.4 (95% CI = 50.5-250.1) for leukemia, and 40.5 (5.7-287.5) for NHL. Concordant twins were similar in age at diagnosis and vital status. CONCLUSIONS: Twin concordance for cancer is largely restricted to monozygotic twins and hematological malignancies, consistent with in utero malignancy transmission demonstrated by others. Our data support clinical monitoring of the twins of cases with hematological malignancies, and does not contribute evidence for genetic factors in other cancers.",,,,,['Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2006 Apr;46(4):412-3.

Four acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines were cultured in ligand-coated wells and control wells, with cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C), doxorubicin, or mitoxantrone, and nine lymphoid leukemia or lymphoma cell lines were cultured with dexamethasone. The growth was evaluated with a colorimetric assay. The drug-induced growth suppression was slightly reduced by the ligand stimulation in 4 out of 17 combinations of cells versus drugs, such as NB4 cells versus Ara-C. In the remainder, the ligands did not significantly affect the drug-sensitivity. To investigate the possible molecular mechanism of the protective effect, the influence of Jagged1 on Ara-C-induced activation of caspase-3 and PARP, and dephosphorylation of NF-kappaB was examined in NB4 cells. However, Jagged1 did not obviously affect the activation and dephosphorylation. It is known that stromal cells reduce drug-induced cytotoxicity of leukemia cells. According to our results, the role of Notch ligands in the stroma-mediated resistance seems to be minor and occurs only in a limited context. However, the ligand-coated culture-plates are more similar to the microenvironment in human bone marrow than ordinary plates.

This leads to changes in apoptotic morphology, such as membrane externalization and cytoplasm and nuclear condensation. It has been reported that pro-caspase-3 is activated in the cytosol. However, it remains obscure how caspase-3 activation correlates to serial changes in cell morphology during apoptosis. The current study was therefore undertaken to assess the relationship between caspase-3 activation and its subcellular localization and alterations in apoptotic morphology in MOLT-4 human leukemia cells exposed to X-ray irradiation. Fluorescence labeled inhibitor of caspases (FLICA) was used to detect caspase-3 activity in apoptotic cells in this project; cell morphology and caspase-3 sub-localization were determined by confocal microscopy. Our data showed that MOLT-4 cells presented typical morphological changes in apoptosis, such as membrane reversion, DNA fragmentation, and formation of apoptotic cell bodies following 10 Gray (Gy) of X-ray irradiation. Caspase-3 was activated 2 h after X-ray irradiation, and its activity increased markedly after 4-6-h exposure. Membrane reversion in MOLT-4 leukemia cells was detected by Annexin V assay at 4 h following X-ray irradiation, 2 h after the elevated caspase-3 activity was measured. Cytologically, activation of caspase-3 was first observed close to the inside surface of the cellular membrane, then transferred to the cytoplasm, and finally translocated to the nuclear region. We conclude that caspase-3 is activated in MOLT-4 cells following exposure to X-rays, and that the enhanced caspase-3 activity and its sub-localization shifting is correlated to changes in apoptotic morphology. The spatial shift of activated caspase-3 in X-ray-induced apoptotic MOLT-4 leukemia cells is a process of crucial importance for apoptosis.","['0 (Enzyme Precursors)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We also used some of these models to investigate whether the molecular effects on the extent of growth in a subcutaneously grafted experimental model correlate with the effects of the same drug on the survival of the animals so grafted. Our data show that all the molecules demonstrated significant anti-tumor activities in two mouse leukemia models (with some discrepancies between the two). Two lymphoma models displayed weaker chemosensitivity profiles than the two leukemia models from which they were developed. Two other models, namely the MXT-HS mammary carcinoma and the B16 melanoma, appeared to be rather chemoresistant. However, a direct relationship was evident between the drug-induced decrease in the tumor growth rate and the increase observed in the survival periods of the MXT tumor-bearing mice. This relationship was also observed in the L1210_LYM lymphoma, though to a lesser extent, and was completely absent from the B16 melanoma model. Finally, our data indicated that we had developed a pair of metastasizing, as opposed to non-metastasizing, lymphoma and mammary carcinoma models.

The obtained data shed light on genomic alterations beyond the basic rearrangements known as 'causative aberrations' in many of these diseases. Some of these alterations seem to play an important role in disease progression and specificity of the disease. They can also be associated with clinical parameters like response to therapy and survival. The patterns of genomic alterations found by CGH can characterize certain disease entities and differentiate them from others. If the chromosomal segments affected in > 10% of the cases of each basic disease entity [acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and multiple myeloma (MM)] are compared, most of the frequently involved chromosomal regions differ from entity to entity in the leukemias. The only exception are losses on 13q which are common to CLL and multiple myeloma. However, these patterns can also deduce chromosomal locations basically involved in the processes of hematopoietic oncogenesis, which is particularly evident in lymphomas. For instance, gain of 18q is shared by all lymphoma entities presented, and gain of 3q, 7q and 12q is commonly found in three of the differentiated classes. It is also of practical interest to control the differences and consistencies of imbalances found in nodular and in organ-confined lymphomas. Besides aneuploidies, which can also be readily detected by chromosome banding, CGH defines imbalances of chromosomal segments, which can become the basis for searching for neoplasia-related genes. With respect to their clinical significance, the presence of genomic imbalances is associated with disease progression and, therefore, poorer prognosis.",,148,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2005 Aug 2.,"CONTEXT: Autoimmune thyroid diseases have been reported to be associated with human T cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I) infection. HTLV-I proviral load is related to the development of HTLV-I-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis and has also been shown to be elevated in the peripheral blood of HTLV-I-infected patients with uveitis, arthritis, and connective tissue disease. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to evaluate the proviral load in HTLV-I-infected patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) or Graves' disease (GD) and ascertain the ability of HTLV-I to infect thyroid cells. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A quantitative real-time PCR assay was developed to measure the proviral load of HTLV-I in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 26 HTLV-I-infected patients with HT, eight HTLV-I-infected patients with GD, or 38 asymptomatic HTLV-I carriers. Rat FRTL-5 thyroid cells were cocultured with HTLV-I-infected T cell line MT-2 or uninfected T cell line CCRF-CEM. After coculture with T cell lines, changes in Tax and cytokine mRNA expression were studied by RT-PCR. RESULTS: HTLV-I proviral load was significantly higher in the peripheral blood of patients with HT and GD than asymptomatic HTLV-I carriers. In the peripheral blood from HTLV-I-infected patients with HT, HTLV-I proviral load did not correlate with the thyroid peroxidase antibody or thyroglobulin antibody titer. After coculture with MT-2 cells, FRTL-5 cells expressed HTLV-I-specific Tax mRNA. These cocultured FRTL-5 cells with MT-2 cells expressed IL-6 mRNA and proliferated more actively than those cocultured with CCRF-CEM cells. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest the role of the retrovirus in the development of autoimmune thyroid diseases in HTLV-I-infected patients.","['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)']",,20050802,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2005 Aug 2.,"Adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) is a highly chemoresistant and usually fatal T-cell malignancy due to the human T-cell lymphotropic virus-1 (HTLV-1). After chemotherapy failure, antiretrovirals and interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) produce brief responses followed by progression and death. More effective agents and new approaches to detect and treat minimal residual disease are needed. ATL cells express CD52, the target of the antibody alemtuzumab, which is active in a preclinical model of ATL and is cytotoxic for p53-deficient cells. A patient with refractory chronic ATL in transformation achieved longer than a 1-year complete hematologic response following 12 weeks of outpatient subcutaneous alemtuzumab. Persistent suppression of HTLV-1 viral load, even at recovery of T cells, after alemtuzumab and efficient in vitro complement-mediated cytotoxicity of primary ATL cells with mutated TP53 were observed. The unprecedented response and the profound suppression of HTLV-1 viral load observed in this patient suggest that further clinical investigation of alemtuzumab in ATL is warranted.","['0 (Anti-HIV Agents)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CD52 Antigen)', '0 (CD52 protein, human)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '3A189DH42V (Alemtuzumab)', '4B9XT59T7S (Zidovudine)']",,20050802,,,"['K23 CA10215-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA95426/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA009338/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC1895052,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2005 Aug 2.,"Small G proteins serve as critical control points in signal transduction, integrating a wide range of stimuli to dictate discrete cellular outcomes. The outcomes of small G-protein signaling can both potentiate and antagonize one another. Studies in hematopoietic cells have uncovered multiple functions for the small G protein, Rap1 (Ras-proximate-1). Because Rap1 can regulate cell proliferation, differentiation, and adhesion through distinct mechanisms, it serves as a paradigm for the need for tight cellular control of small G-protein function. Rap1 has received recent attention for its role in enhancing integrin-dependent signals. This action of Rap1 augments a variety of processes that characterize hematopoietic-cell function, including aggregation, migration, extravasation, and homing to target tissues. Rap1 may also regulate cellular differentiation and proliferation via pathways that are distinct from those mediating adhesion, and involve regulation of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase or ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) cascade. These actions of Rap1 occur in selected cell types to enhance or diminish ERK signaling, depending on the expression pattern of the MAP kinase kinase kinases of the Raf family: Raf-1 and B-Raf. This review will examine the functions of Rap1 in hematopoietic cells, and focus on 3 cellular scenarios where the multiple actions of Rap1 function have been proposed. Recent studies implicating Rap1 in the maturation of megakaryocytes, the pathogenesis of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), and activation of peripheral T cells will receive particular attention.",['EC 3.6.5.2 (rap1 GTP-Binding Proteins)'],127,20050802,,,['AI047 337/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],PMC1895320,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We evaluated outcome according to FLT3/ITD status in 1135 adult patients treated according to United Kingdom Medical Research Council (UK MRC) AML protocols: 141 received an autograft, and 170 received a matched sibling allograft in first complete remission (CR). An FLT3/ITD was detected in 25% of patients and was an independent predictor for relapse (P < .001). It remained prognostic for increased relapse in patients who received a transplant (odds ratio [OR] = 1.91; 95% confidence intervals [CIs] = 1.13-3.21; P = .02), with no evidence of a difference in effect between patients who received an autograft (OR = 2.39; CIs = 1.24-4.62) and patients who received an allograft (OR = 1.31; CIs = 0.56-3.06) (test for interaction, P = .3) or between patients who did or did not receive a transplant (P = .4). These results were confirmed in an analysis of 186 patients randomized to receive or not receive an autograft in first CR and in a donor-versus-no donor analysis of 683 patients to assess the role of allograft (for latter, FLT3/ITD(-) OR = 0.70, CIs = 0.53-0.92; FLT3/ITD(+) OR = 0.59, CIs = 0.40-0.87; test for interaction, P = .5).

We screened 401 AML patients with normal karyotype treated within the German AML Cooperative Group Protocol 99 (AMLCG99) study for NPM1 mutations. Results were related with partial tandem duplications within the MLL gene (MLL-PTD), Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3-length mutations (FLT3-LM), the tyrosine kinase domain of FLT3 (FLT3-TKD), NRAS, KIT, and CEBPA mutations and with clinical characteristics and outcome. NPM1 mutations were detected in 212 (52.9%) of 401 patients. Fourteen mutations, including 8 new variants, were identified. NPM1-mutated cases associated frequently with FLT3 mutations but rarely with other mutations. The NPM1-mutated group had a higher complete remission (CR) rate (70.5% vs 54.7%, P = .003), a trend to a longer overall survival (OS; median 1012 vs 549 days, P = .076), and significantly longer event-free survival (EFS; median 428 vs 336 days; P = .012). The favorable impact of NPM1 mutations on OS and EFS clearly emerged in the large group (264 [66.8%] of 395 cases) of normal-karyotype AML without FLT3-LM. This positive effect was lost in the presence of a concomitant FLT3-LM, since survival of the NPM1+/FLT3-LM+ double positive was similar to NPM1-/FLT3-LM+ cases. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that NPM1+/FLT3-LM- mutations are an independent predictor for a favorable outcome in AML with normal karyotype.","['0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)']",,20050802,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Supervised learning algorithms are naturally suited to analyse a large amount of data generated using these technologies in biomarker discovery efforts. The study demonstrates with two examples a data-driven analysis approach to analysis of large complicated datasets collected in high-throughput technologies in the context of biomarker discovery. The approach consists of two analytic steps: an initial unsupervised analysis to obtain accurate knowledge about sample clustering, followed by a second supervised analysis to identify a small set of putative biomarkers for further experimental characterization. By comparing the most widely applied clustering algorithms using a leukaemia DNA microarray dataset, it was established that principal component analysis-assisted projections of samples from a high-dimensional molecular feature space into a few low dimensional subspaces provides a more effective and accurate way to explore visually and identify data structures that confirm intended experimental effects based on expected group membership. A supervised analysis method, shrunken centroid algorithm, was chosen to take knowledge of sample clustering gained or confirmed by the first step of the analysis to identify a small set of molecules as candidate biomarkers for further experimentation. The approach was applied to two molecular-profiling studies. In the first study, PCA-assisted analysis of DNA microarray data revealed that discrete data structures exist in rat liver gene expression and correlated with blood clinical chemistry and liver pathological damage in response to a chemical toxicant diethylhexylphthalate, a peroxisome-proliferator-activator receptor agonist. Sixteen genes were then identified by shrunken centroid algorithm as the best candidate biomarkers for liver damage. Functional annotations of these genes revealed roles in acute phase response, lipid and fatty acid metabolism and they are functionally relevant to the observed toxicities. In the second study, 26 urine ions identified from a GC/MS spectrum, two of which were glucose fragment ions included as positive controls, showed robust changes with the development of diabetes in Zucker diabetic fatty rats. Further experiments are needed to define their chemical identities and establish functional relevancy to disease development.","['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', 'C42K0PH13C (Diethylhexyl Phthalate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The etoposide-resistant mouse breast cancer cell line FvP, which is derived from FM3A, and etoposide-resistant human breast cancer cell line, MDA-VP, which derived from MDA-P cells showed increased sensitivity to etoposide as well as increased expression of human Topoisomerase IIa mRNA, but this was not seen in FM3A and MDA-P cells. On the other hand, the etoposide-resistant human leukemia cell line K562/MX2 and the parental cell line K562/P did not show enhanced sensitivity against etoposide or an increase in human Topoisomerase IIa mRNA. Using a recombinant adenovirus containing beta-galactosidase gene (Ad-beta-gal), K562 cells were not transducted by the recombinant adenovirus, while both etoposide-sensitive FM3A cells and etoposide resistant FvP cells were transducted by recombinant adenovirus. Ad-hTOP2alpha and etopside treatment showed reduced inoculated tumor weight in the mice. We concluded that a recombinant adenovirus containing the human Topoisomerase IIalpha gene might be a powerful tool for overcoming drug resistance in breast cancer cells, but not in leukemia cells.","['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2005 Aug 1.,"Nitric oxide (NO) has been shown to be cytotoxic for normal and transformed cell lines. One of the intracellular targets for NO action is glutathione (GSH). GSH determinates cellular redox potential and modulates several biological events. During oxidative and nitrosative stress, glutathione system imbalance is associated with the upregulation of gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase (gamma-GCS) expression, which is mediated by nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB). Our previous studies demonstrated a cytotoxic effect of NO and taxol on human lymphoblastic leukemia cells triggered by inhibition of NF-kappaB activity. In this study, we have demonstrated the involvement of GSH in taxol- and NO-induced cytotoxic effects on human CEM leukemia cells. NO- and taxol-induced a depletion of GSH levels in CEM cells, which was potentialized by l-buthionine-S,R-sulfoximine (BSO), an inhibitor of gamma-GCS. BSO induced an increase in nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB. However, when cells were treated with NO or taxol in association with BSO, these compounds inhibited the constitutive activity of NF-kappaB. These results suggest that oxidative and nitrosative damage in lymphoblastic leukemia cells shall be mediated by NO- and taxol-induced GSH depletion as a consequence of preventing GSH synthesis.","['0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Thiocarbamates)', '135467-92-4 (prolinedithiocarbamate)', '31C4KY9ESH (Nitric Oxide)', '5072-26-4 (Buthionine Sulfoximine)', '79032-48-7 (S-Nitroso-N-Acetylpenicillamine)', '9DLQ4CIU6V (Proline)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)', 'U68WG3173Y (Carmustine)']",,20050801,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To discover fundamental Runx functions in the cell biology of animal development, we have employed morpholino antisense-mediated knockdown of the sea urchin Runx protein SpRunt-1. Previously we showed that embryos depleted of SpRunt-1 arrest development at early gastrula stage and underexpress the conventional protein kinase C SpPKC1. RESULTS: We report here that SpRunt-1 deficiency leads to ectopic cell proliferation and extensive apoptosis. Suppression of the apoptosis by pharmacological inhibition of caspase-3 prevents the ectopic proliferation and rescues gastrulation, indicating that many of the overt defects obtained by knockdown of SpRunt-1 are secondary to the apoptosis. Inhibition or knockdown of SpPKC1 also causes apoptosis, while cell survival is rescued in SpRunt-1 morphant embryos coinjected with SpPKC1 mRNA, suggesting that the apoptosis associated with SpRunt-1 deficiency is caused by the deficit in SpPKC1 expression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation indicates that SpRunt-1 interacts physically with SpPKC1 in vivo, and cis-regulatory analysis shows that this interaction activates SpPKC1 transcription. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that Runx-dependent activation of SpPKC1 is essential for maintaining protein kinase C activity at levels conducive to cell survival during embryogenesis.","['0 (Core Binding Factor alpha Subunits)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)']",,20050802,,,"['R01 GM070840/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'GM070840/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",PMC1187879,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of this paper is to review the published epidemiological studies on the association between atopy and the risk of cancers. METHODS: Through an electronic search (January 1986-April 2004) with an additional review of cited references, we identified studies with quantitative data on the relation of atopy (irrespective of its definition or subtype) to cancer (different cancer sites). RESULTS: The protective effect of atopy in colorectal cancer has been observed consistently in the case-control studies, but not in cohort studies. A consistent inverse association between self-reported atopy and glioma risk has been shown, but there is absence of such an association for meningioma. In most studies, the risk of leukaemia, in particular childhood leukaemia, tends to be lower among people with a history of atopy. Studies, which looked at, the association between atopic diseases and risk of cancers of pancreatic, breast, lymphoma showed varying outcomes. Most studies on the atopy-pancreatic cancer relation suggested an inverse association. For lymphoma, most studies have shown no substantial association. Overall evidence indicates an increased risk of lung cancer among persons with a history of asthma. CONCLUSION: Despite the mixed results, the emerging picture from most of the currently available epidemiological data indicate that atopic disease is associated with a reduced risk for cancer. Further research should focus on a more carefully defined 'atopy' status and manifestation of different atopic diseases, to advance our understanding of the role that allergies might play in the risk of developing cancer.",,75,,,['Allergy. 2005 Sep;60(9):1095-7.

Biased V(H) gene usage has also been reported in CLL which may reflect antigen selection. In a V(H) gene analysis of 265 CLL cases we confirmed the prognostic impact of the V(H) mutation status and found preferential V(H) gene usage in both the mutated and unmutated subset. Interestingly, CLL cases rearranging one particular V(H) gene, V(H)3-21, displayed poor outcome despite that two-thirds showed mutated V(H) genes. Many of the V(H)3-21 utilizing cases expressed lambda light chains, rearranged a Vlambda2-14 gene, and had homologous complementarity determining region 3s (CDR3s), implying recognition of a common antigen epitope. We thus believe that the cases rearranging the V(H)3-21 gene comprises an additional CLL entity. We further analyzed the V(H) gene rearrangements and, specifically, the heavy chain CDR3 sequences in 346 CLL cases to investigate the role of antigens in CLL. We identified six new subgroups with similar HCDR3 features and restricted VL gene usage as in the V(H)3-21-using group. Our data indicate a limited number of antigen recognition sites in these subgroups and give further evidence for antigen selection in the development of CLL. Different mutational cutoffs have been used to distinguish mutated CLL in addition to the 2% cutoff. Using three levels of somatic mutations we divided 323 CLLs into subsets with divergent survival (<2%, 2-5% and >5% mutations). This division revealed a low-mutated subgroup (2-5%) with inferior outcome that would have been masked using the traditional 2% cutoff. A 1513A/C polymorphism in the P2X(7) receptor gene was reported to be more frequent in CLL, but no difference in genotype frequencies was revealed in our 170 CLL cases and 200 controls. However, CLL cases with the 1513AC genotype showed superior survival than 1513AA cases and this was in particular confined to CLL with mutated VH genes. In summary, we could define new prognostic subgroups in CLL using Ig gene rearrangement analysis. This also allowed us to gain insights in the biology and potential role of antigen involvement in the pathogenesis of CLL.","['0 (P2RX7 protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Purinergic P2)', '0 (Receptors, Purinergic P2X7)']",102,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Agonist interaction with phospholipase C-linked receptors at the plasma membrane can elicit both Ca2+ and Na+ influxes in lymphocytes. While Ca2+ influx is mediated by Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+ (CRAC) channels, the pathway responsible for Na+ influx is largely unknown. 2. We show that thapsigargin, ionomycin, ADP-ribose and IP3 activated a nonselective cation channel in lymphocytes that had a slightly outwardly rectifying I-V relationship, and a single channel conductance of 23.1 pS. We termed this channel a Ca2+ release-activated nonselective cation (CRANC) channel. 3. On activation in cell-attached configuration, switching to an inside-out configuration abolished CRANC channel activity. 4. Transfection of Jurkat T cells with antisense oligonucleotides for LTRPC2 reduced capacitative Ca2+ entry. 5. These results suggest that CRANC channels are responsible for the Na+ influx as well as a portion of the Ca2+ influx in lymphocytes induced by store depletion, that sustained activation of CRANC channels requires some property of the environment of a cell depleted of its Ca2+ stores; and that LTRPC2 protein is a likely component of the CRANC channel.","['0 (Cations)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Ion Channels)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (TRPM Cation Channels)', '0 (TRPM2 protein, human)', '67526-95-8 (Thapsigargin)', '9NEZ333N27 (Sodium)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,,,,"['AI37670/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'DK55647/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'HL68806/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2005 Jul 27.,"The childhood leukemia cluster in the proximity of the German nuclear establishments of Geesthacht is unique in its spatial and temporal concentration. After a steep increase in cases in 1990, the cluster continues to show a significant increase up to the present. Early investigations of blood samples from a casual sample of local residents showed an increase in dicentric chromosomes in lymphocytes, indicating exposure exceeding dose limits. Analyses of the immission data revealed several unexpected deliveries of fission and activation products in the environment but provided no explanation of the source. Because of the observed overdispersion of dicentric chromosomes in cells, the idea of a contribution by densely ionizing emitters was compelling. The routine programs, however, do not include alpha emitters. These were measured in specific studies that proved contamination by transuranic nuclides. As shown in the present investigation, routine environmental surveillance programs support the occurrence of an accidental event near Geesthacht in September 1986. Until now, neither the cause nor the complete scenario of the activity release could be established. The ongoing discussion highlights limitations in the immission-control concept, which is predominantly based on gamma-radiation monitoring.","['0 (Air Pollutants, Radioactive)', '0 (Environmental Pollutants)', '0 (Soil Pollutants, Radioactive)', '0 (Water Pollutants, Radioactive)', '9679TC07X4 (Iodine)']",,20050727,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CASE: A 6-month-old male infant developed occlusive microvascular retinopathy after BMT to treat acute lymphocytic leukemia. OBSERVATIONS: Four months after the transplantation, retinal edema, hemorrhage, soft exudates, and neovascularization were found in the posterior pole fundus of the right eye and in the peripheral fundus of the left eye. After oral prednisolone was administered, the retinal lesions regressed and cicatrices with chorioretinal atrophy and fibrous tissue formed. CONCLUSIONS: Neovascularization following occlusive microvascular retinopathy after BMT in infant eyes responds well to oral prednisolone.

Epub 2005 Aug 2.,"Dihydroartemisinin (DHA), a more water-soluble active metabolite of artemisinin derivatives, is safe and the most effective antimalarial analog of artemisinin. In the present investigation, we assessed the effect of DHA on vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression and apoptosis in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) K562 cells. The results demonstrated that in addition to its antiproliferation effect on CML cells, DHA was also found to induce K562 cells apoptosis. The percentage of apoptotic cells was increased to 6.9 and 15.8% after being treated with 5 and 10 micromol/l DHA for 48 h, respectively (P<0.001). In order to analyze the effect of DHA on VEGF expression in K562 cells, we assessed the level of VEGF expression by western blot; detected the form of VEGF mRNA by RT-PCR and examined the level of VEGF secreted in conditioned media (CM) by ELISA assay. All these experiments suggested that DHA could inhibit the VEGF expression and secretion effectively in K562 cells, even at a lower concentration (2 micromol/l, P<0.05). Moreover, we further assessed the stimulating angiogenic activity of CM from K562 cells on CAM model. The angiogenic activity was decreased in response to the CM from K562 cells pretreated with DHA in a dose-dependent manner. Taken together, these results from our study together with its known low toxicity make it possible that DHA might present potential antileukemia effect as a treatment for CML therapy, or as an adjunct to standard chemotherapeutic regimens.","['0 (Antimalarials)', '0 (Artemisinins)', '0 (Sesquiterpenes)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '6A9O50735X (artenimol)']",,20050802,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These findings have been interpreted as evidence for contamination despite the repeated isolation of some type C viruses from separate clinical specimens or from separate frozen primary cell stocks of the same donor. Our laboratory has described a type C virus which is released from the HEL-12 strain of normal human embryonic lung fibroblasts. The HEL-12 virus is related immunologically to simian sarcoma (woolly monkey fibrosarcoma) virus (SiSV) and the endogenous type C viruses of baboons and domestic cats. To demonstrate that the HEL-12 virus is not an adventitious contaminant, fresh human tissues were examined for antigenic cross-reactivity with HEL-12 virus antigens. Some patients with myelogenous leukemia contain circulating immunoglobulins which specifically inhibit the reverse transcriptases of HEL-12 virus and primate type C viruses. In addition, the glomerular immune complexes in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus contain antigens related to HEL-12 virus proteins.

Total thymectomy in young mice of this strain results in a marked decrease in the incidence of leukaemia. The finding of athymic mutant mice on the AKR/J background (referred to as streaker mice) is of importance in the study of genetic factors which influence virus expression and leukaemogenesis. Here we report that mice of both normal and mutant genotypes vary in the expression of a particular class of murine leukaemia virus. This lower virus expression in conjunction with the absence of a thymus leads to a lower tumour incidence in streaker mice.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In all, 12 patients received more than one course of anti-HCV treatment if they had HCV RNA still detectable after the first course of treatment and no treatment contraindications. Combined therapy (pegylated interferon (IFN): n=9, or standard IFN: n=9, in combination with ribavirin) led to sustained virological response in 4/18 (20%) patients as compared to 2/20 (10%) in patients who received IFN alone. Hematological toxicity was more frequent with combined therapy. While anemia responded to erythropoietin and/or dose modification, thrombocytopenia usually led to treatment interruption (n=3). This study thus highlights the efficacy of combined therapy and emphasizes the fact that the undue safety concerns are not a problem when treating this particular population.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

First, already-stained and covered slides should be immersed in xylene for removal of cover slips. After passage through a descending ethanol series, slides are ready for DNA extraction. If the neoplastic cells on slides are mixed with nonneoplastic lymphocytes, cells of interest are isolated by microdissection. Two easy methods to dissect the samples using hydrophobic and hydrophilic mounting media are detailed. Second, microdissected cells are collected in microtubes and digested with proteinase K. The cells that did not undergo the microdissection are digested and dissolve in the proteinase K solution on the slides. Last, the template DNA is extracted from the solution and provided to PCR. We use two sets of primers for detection of HTLV-1 genes, and the products of amplification by PCR that correspond to the pX and tax regions are expected to be 127 and 159 base pairs long, respectively. Although this method does not provide proof of the monoclonal integration of HTLV-1 genes, it can be applied when adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma is suspected cytologically but fresh samples for Southern blotting are unavailable.","['0 (DNA, Viral)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and virus isolation techniques revealed that a high percentage of HTLV seroreactivity among intravenous drug users and blood donors in the United States is caused by HTLV-2.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty-six pretreated patients with CD22+ non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL; n = 4), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL; n = 11), and hairy cell leukemia (HCL; n = 31) received 265 cycles at 3 to 50 microg/Kg every other day x 3 doses. RESULTS: BL22 was active in HCL, with 19 complete remissions (CRs; 61%) and six partial responses (PRs; 19%) in 31 patients. Of 19 CRs, 11 were achieved after one cycle and eight after two to 14 cycles. All 25 responders benefited clinically with one cycle. The CR rate was 86% in patients enrolled at > or = 40 microg/Kg every other day x 3, and 41% at lower doses (P = .011). The median duration for CR was 36 months (range, 5 to 66 months), and eight patients remain in CR at 45 months (range, 29 to 66 months). Lower but significant activity occurred in CLL. Neutralizing antibodies occurred in 11 (24%) of 46 patients (all HCL). A reversible hemolytic uremic syndrome requiring plasmapheresis was observed in one patient with NHL during cycle 1 and in four patients with HCL during cycle 2 or 3. The maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) evaluated at cycle 1 was 40 microg/Kg IV. QOD x 3. The most common toxicities at 30 to 50 microg/Kg every other day x 3 included hypoalbuminemia, transaminase elevations, fatigue, and edema. CONCLUSION: BL22 was well tolerated and highly effective in HCL, even after one cycle. Phase II testing is underway to define the efficacy with one cycle and to study safety when additional cycles are needed for optimal response.","['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Enterotoxins)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '0 (RFB4(dsFv)-PE38 recombinant immunotoxin)']",,20050801,,,['Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Loss of telomere function as a consequence of proliferation-associated sequence attrition results in genome instability, which may facilitate carcinogenesis by generating growth-promoting mutations. However, unlimited cellular proliferation requires the maintenance of telomeric DNA; thus, the majority of tumor cells maintain their telomeres either through the activity of telomerase or via a mechanism known as alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT). Recent data suggest that constitutive telomere maintenance may not be required in all tumor types. Here we assess the role and requirement of telomere maintenance in liposarcoma. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Tumor samples were analyzed with respect to telomerase activity, telomere length, and the presence of ALT-specific subcellular structures, ALT-associated promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies. This multi-assay assessment improved the accuracy of categorization. RESULTS: Our data reveal a significant incidence (24%) of ALT-positive liposarcomas, whereas telomerase is used at a similar frequency (27%). A large number of tumors (49%) do not show characteristics of telomerase or ALT. In addition, telomere length was always shorter in recurrent disease, regardless of the telomere maintenance mechanism. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that approximately one half of liposarcomas either employ a novel constitutively active telomere maintenance mechanism or lack such a mechanism. Analysis of recurrent tumors suggests that liposarcomas can develop despite limiting or undetectable activity of a constitutively active telomere maintenance mechanism.","['0 (Nucleoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)']",,,,,"['CA006927/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA098087-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA109442-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA09035-29/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

More than 100 nucleosides were tested for antisilencing activity with a selected clone in which the silenced expression of luciferase could be recovered by 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine. A group of halogenated thymidine analogues was found to reactivate transcription of not only the reporter retrovirus vector but also endogenous glutathione-S-transferase 1 gene, without influence to DNA hypermethylation.

Incorporation of CNDAC triphosphate into DNA and extension during replication leads to single-strand breaks directly caused by beta-elimination. These breaks, or the lesions that arise from further processing, cause cells to arrest in G2. The purpose of this investigation was to define the molecular basis for G2 checkpoint activation and to delineate the sequelae of its abrogation. Cell lines derived from diverse human tissues underwent G2 arrest after CNDAC treatment, suggesting a common mechanism of response to the damage created. CNDAC-induced G2 arrest was instituted by activation of the Chk1-Cdc25C-Cdk1/cyclin B checkpoint pathway. Neither Chk2, p38, nor p53 was required for checkpoint activation. Inhibition of Chk1 kinase with 7-hydroxystaurosporine (UCN-01) abrogated the checkpoint pathway as indicated by dephosphorylation of checkpoint proteins and progression of cells through mitosis and into G1. Cell death was first evident in hematologic cell lines after G1 entry. As indicated by histone H2AX phosphorylation, DNA damage initiated by CNDAC incorporation was transformed into double-strand breaks when ML-1 cells arrested in G2. Some breaks were manifested as chromosomal aberrations when the G2 checkpoint of CNDAC-arrested cells was abrogated by UCN-01 but also in a minor population of cells that escaped to mitosis during treatment with CNDAC alone. These findings provide a mechanistic rationale for the design of new strategies, combining CNDAC with inhibitors of cell cycle checkpoint regulation in the therapy of hematologic malignancies.","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', ""134665-72-8 (2'-cyano-2'-deoxyarabinofuranosylcytosine)"", '7BU5H4V94A (7-hydroxystaurosporine)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (CHEK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Checkpoint Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDC2 Protein Kinase)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)']",,,,,"['CA28596/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA55164/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA16672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

BIAcore analysis, immunoblot, and confocal microscopy of wild-type and mutant EphA3 with compromised ephrin-A5 or IIIA4-binding capacities indicate that IIIA4 binding triggers an EphA3 conformation which is permissive for the assembly of EphA3/ephrin-A5-type signaling clusters. Furthermore, unclustered IIIA4 and ephrin-A5 Fc applied in combination initiate greatly enhanced EphA3 signaling. Radiometal conjugates of ephrin-A5 and IIIA4 retain their affinity, and in mouse xenografts localize to, and are internalized rapidly into EphA3-positive, human tumors.

The chimeric gene fused exon 4 of the TEL gene with exon 7 of the PTPRR gene, and produced 10 isoforms through alternative splicing. Two isoforms that were expressed at the highest level in the leukemic cells could have been translated into COOH-terminally truncated TEL protein possessing the helix-loop-helix domain (tTEL) and TEL/PTPRR chimeric protein linking the helix-loop-helix domain of TEL to the catalytic domain of PTPRR. These two mutant proteins exerted a dominant-negative effect over transcriptional repression mediated by wild-type TEL, although they themselves did not show any transcriptional activity. Heterodimerization with wild-type TEL might be an underlying mechanism in this effect. TEL/PTPRR did not exhibit any tyrosine phosphatase activity. Importantly, overexpression of TEL/PTPRR in granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor-dependent UT7/GM cells resulted in their factor-independent proliferation, whereas overexpression of tTEL did not. After cytokine depletion, phosphorylated signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3) significantly declined in mock cells, but remained in both tTEL- and TEL/PTPRR-overexpressing cells.

AF4p12, highly conserved in evolution, encodes a large protein of 3,105 amino acids. The expression of AF4p12 has been preferentially detected in colon, placenta, and brain tissues and in tumor cells of lymphoid origin. We show that the t(4;11)(p12;q23) translocation results in the creation of a chimeric RNA encoding a putative fusion protein containing 1,362 amino acids from the NH2-terminal part of MLL and 712 amino acids from the COOH-terminal part of AF4p12. FLT3 and HOXA9 genes are overexpressed in this leukemia. We found that the COOH-terminal part of AF4p12 fused to MLL contains a leucine zipper motif and exhibits transcriptional activation properties when fused to Gal4 DNA-binding domains in transient transfection assays. The AF4p12 fragment fused to MLL may contribute to the oncogenic activation of MLL, possibly through specific recruitment of the transcriptional machinery.","['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With rapid advances in electromagnetic field (EMF) technologies and communications, children are increasingly exposed to EMFs at earlier and earlier ages. Consistent epidemiologic evidence of an association between childhood leukemia and exposure to extremely low frequency (ELF) magnetic fields has led to their classification by the International Agency for Research on Cancer as a ""possible human carcinogen."" Concerns about the potential vulnerability of children to radio frequency (RF) fields have been raised because of the potentially greater susceptibility of their developing nervous systems; in addition, their brain tissue is more conductive, RF penetration is greater relative to head size, and they will have a longer lifetime of exposure than adults. To evaluate information relevant to children's sensitivity to both ELF and RF EMFs and to identify research needs, the World Health Organization held an expert workshop in Istanbul, Turkey, in June 2004. This article is based on discussions from the workshop and provides background information on the development of the embryo, fetus, and child, with particular attention to the developing brain; an outline of childhood susceptibility to environmental toxicants and childhood diseases implicated in EMF studies; and a review of childhood exposure to EMFs. It also includes an assessment of the potential susceptibility of children to EMFs and concludes with a recommendation for additional research and the development of precautionary policies in the face of scientific uncertainty.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2005 Aug 2.,"The development of refractory disease is often associated with the overexpression of multidrug resistance (MDR) proteins, especially in several hematological malignancies, such as acute myeloid leukemias (AML), multiple myeloma (MM) and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL). Since the recognition of these proteins, several attempts have been made to modulate their expression and activity (protein kinase C inhibitors, anti-MDR-1 oligonucleotides, pharmacological competitors and transcriptional inhibitors). Six new compounds (MM 36, CTS 4, CTS 9, CTS 12, CTS 27 and CTS 41), derived from verapamil (VRP), were designed and synthesized to improve their MDR-reverting activity and reduce cardiovascular effects. Cytotoxicity (WST-1 methods) and functional (calcein-acetoxymethyl (Calcein-AM)) assays were performed on a resistant cell line K-562/doxR and on the mononuclear cells (MNCs) of patients with AML. Furthermore, the six molecules were tested for their vasodilator, inotropic and chronotropic activity on guinea pig aortic strip and isolated atrium preparations, respectively. Comparison between survival plots and relative ID50, obtained from the K-562/doxR cells treated with Idarubicin (IDA), in the presence or absence of inhibitors, showed that these compounds function well. All the resistance modifying agents potentiated IDA activity inducing a significant reduction (P<0.01) in ID(50) values in comparison to VRP at each of the concentrations tested, but MM 36, CTS 27 and CTS 41 demonstrated the strongest activity. Results obtained from the MNCs were superimposible to K-562/doxR. Further studies on pump functional analysis confirmed the cytotoxic test results: MM 36, CTS 27 and CTS 41 showed a striking inhibition of P-glycoprotein (Pgp) efflux in K-562/doxR and MNCs. Cardiovascular activity of MM 36, CTS 27 and CTS 41, that are the most interesting compounds as MDR inhibitors, followed this course: MM 36>CTS 27>CTS 41, the last one presenting no cardiovascular activity. Chemosensivity to IDA in K-562/doxR cells and AML blasts could be enhanced in vitro by the adjuvant use of the six new VRP analogues. Compared to VRP, all the new compounds presented good MDR-reverting- and reduced cardiovascular activities along with no vasorelaxant effects. The particularly favourable results in some cases (MM 36, CTS 27 and CTS 41) suggests that anti-MDR activity should be further evaluated in clinical trials in patients with myeloid malignancies.","['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Anti-Arrhythmia Agents)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)']",,20050802,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The committee brought together staff from the inpatient pediatric unit, cancer center, home care, and hospice care services within the St. John Health System. Utilizing established staff and services, this group began to provide care for children with potentially life limiting illnesses in a coordinated, multidisciplinary team approach. The positive outcomes of this approach include an overall increase in patient and family satisfaction with care, a decrease in the number of emergency room visits and inpatient hospital stays, and an increase in patient and family informed decision making and goal setting.

For childhood leukemia, a doubling of risk has been associated with exposures above 0.3/0.4 microT. Here, we propose that the melatonin hypothesis, in which power frequency magnetic fields suppress the nocturnal production of melatonin in the pineal gland, accounts for the observed increased risk of childhood leukemia. Such melatonin disruption has been shown in animals, especially with exposure to electric and/or rapid on/off magnetic fields. Equivocal evidence has been obtained from controlled laboratory magnetic field exposures of volunteers, although the exposure conditions are generally atypical of neighborhood exposures. In contrast, support for the hypothesis is found in the body of studies showing magnetic field disruption of melatonin in human populations chronically exposed to both electric and magnetic fields associated with electricity distribution. Further support comes from the observation that melatonin is highly protective of oxidative damage to the human haemopoietic system. Aspects of the hypothesis are amenable to further investigation.",['JL5DK93RCL (Melatonin)'],96,,"['Copyright 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The major morphological subtypes of leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML), are characterized by chromosomal translocations involving over 200 genes including mixed lineage leukemia (MLL), TEL, and AML1. Chromosomal translocations involving the MLL gene at 11q23 are a common feature of infant acute leukemia, found in up to 80% of all cases, and there is strong evidence that rearrangements involving the MLL gene or the TEL-AML1 gene fusion can originate in utero. As with most other cancers, the mechanism by which leukemia arises is likely to involve gene-environment interactions. Accordingly, it is important to identify exposures that cause DNA damage and induce chromosome breaks which are inadequately repaired, ultimately leading to the initiation and disease progression. Exposures acting before birth and early in life has long been thought to be important determinants of leukemia, and the list of suspected chemical, physical, and biological agents continues to increase. Unfortunately, the evidence regarding the majority of suggested exposures is limited and often contradictory, and there are areas, which clearly warrant further investigation in order to further our understanding of the aetiology of childhood leukemia.",,54,,"['Copyright 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of this study was to define P53 gene mutations, to detect MDM2 gene amplification and to estimate mRNA expression of P53, MDM2, BCL2 and BAX genes in patients with ALL and AML. Twenty-five patients with ALL and 65 patients with AML, both recently diagnosed, were included into this study. Exons 5-8 of the P53 gene with flanking intronic sequence were amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method and subjected to mutation screening by single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis (SSCP). Mutation of the P53 gene was found in one patient of the 25 with ALL and in five patients of the 65 with AML. Sequence analysis was subsequently performed. One mutation in intronic sequence in ALL and four missense mutations and one silent nucleotide substitution in AML were identified. Amplification of MDM2 gene was detected by multiplex-PCR analysis in only one sample from patient with ALL, but was not observed in any case of AML. To gain further insight into the role of P53 network in the evolution of acute leukemias, the P53, MDM2, BCL2 and BAX mRNAexpressions in portion samples from patients with ALL and AML were analyzed using multiplex RT-PCR. Although a low frequency of molecular disturbances of the P53 and the MDM2 genes was detected in this study, there was a high percentage of cases with increased mRNA level of P53 and MDM2. A high frequency of BCL2 mRNA overexpression and a relatively low frequency of BAX mRNA overexpression detected in both analyzed leukemias in this study, indicate that altered transcription of these genes may be involved in leukemogenesis.","['0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (MDM2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Of all flavonoids used only QU treatments led in both cell lines to DNA fragmentation, cleavage of poly (ADP- ribose) polymerase (PARP), up-regulation of proapoptotic Bax and posttranslational modification (phosphorylation) of antiapoptotic Bcl-2. Cytochrome c and p21WAF1/CIP1 levels remained unchanged in these cells. Furthermore, treatments of both cell lines by QU and in its combined application with DOX increased phosphorylation of ERK, while Akt-1 and phosphorylated Akt-1 levels were not changed. All these events resulted in effective induction of apoptosis associated with down-regulation of P-glycoprotein in resistant cells. Presented results suggest that in human leukemia cells QU is a potent regulator of the cell apoptotic program associated with the modulation of several signaling molecules.","['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '7V515PI7F6 (Apigenin)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '9IKM0I5T1E (Quercetin)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (AKT1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'KUX1ZNC9J2 (Luteolin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fluorescence in situ hybridization has also been demonstrated to be effective in detecting other chromosomal rearrangements in paraffin-embedded tissue. This retrospective study of cutaneous lesions from four patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia evaluates the utility of performing fluorescence in situ hybridization to confirm the presence of cutaneous manifestations of acute promyelocytic leukemia in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded skin biopsies. All patients had previous bone marrow findings of acute promyelocytic leukemia with characteristic morphology, immunophenotype, and cytogenetic studies, which detailed the presence of the t(15;17)(q22;q12) rearrangement. Two skin biopsies showed an infiltrate of blastic cells involving the dermis in a diffuse pattern and one biopsy had a perivascular/periadnexal pattern. The fourth case, involving the scrotum, showed a predominant neutrophilic infiltrate diffusely involving the dermis and epidermis with a subset of blastic cells. Nuclei were extracted from core biopsies of the formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue and fluorescence in situ hybridization was performed using a dual color, dual fusion PML / RARA probe.

Epub 2005 Jul 29.,"Nuclear aggregates formed by proteins containing expanded poly-glutamine (poly-Q) tracts have been linked to the pathogenesis of poly-Q neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we show that a protein (GFP170*) lacking poly-Q tracts forms nuclear aggregates that share characteristics of poly-Q aggregates. GFP170* aggregates recruit cellular chaperones and proteasomes, and alter the organization of nuclear domains containing the promyelocytic leukemia (PML) protein. These results suggest that the formation of nuclear aggregates and their effects on nuclear architecture are not specific to poly-Q proteins. Using GFP170* as a model substrate, we explored the mechanistic details of nuclear aggregate formation. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching and fluorescence loss in photobleaching analyses show that GFP170* molecules exchange rapidly between aggregates and a soluble pool of GFP170*, indicating that the aggregates are dynamic accumulations of GFP170*. The formation of cytoplasmic and nuclear GFP170* aggregates is microtubule-dependent. We show that within the nucleus, GFP170* initially deposits in small aggregates at or adjacent to PML bodies. Time-lapse imaging of live cells shows that small aggregates move toward each other and fuse to form larger aggregates. The coalescence of the aggregates is accompanied by spatial rearrangements of the PML bodies. Significantly, we find that the larger nuclear aggregates have complex internal substructures that reposition extensively during fusion of the aggregates. These studies suggest that nuclear aggregates may be viewed as dynamic multidomain inclusions that continuously remodel their components.","['0 (Aggrecans)', '0 (Extracellular Matrix Proteins)', '0 (Lectins, C-Type)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Proteoglycans)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', '26700-71-0 (polyglutamine)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",,20050729,,,"['R01 GM062696/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 HL007553/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM-062696/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 HL07553/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC1237092,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A prospective clinical study was conducted at the University Hospital of Larissa, Greece. The study included 50 patients admitted with failed pregnancy and suspected ectopic pregnancy that were treated with curettage or laparoscopy and classified as histologically confirmed EPs (n = 27) or histologically confirmed aIUPs (n = 21) (mean gestational age of 7.15 and 7.3 weeks, respectively). Two suspected EPs proved to be normal IUPs and were excluded. VEGF, GLY, P, beta-HCG, PAPP-A, HPL and LIF were measured by enxyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) methods in a single pre-operative blood sample. RESULTS: The median VEGF concentration was 227.2 pg/ml in the EP group versus 107.2 pg/ml in the aIUP group (P < 0.001), with a suggested threshold value of 174 pg/ml for their differential diagnosis. LIF, P, PAPP-A, HPL and GLY serum measurements did not differ significantly between EP and aIUP. CONCLUSION: VEGF serum levels might be a useful marker in differentiating between EPs and aIUPs.","['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Glycodelin)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (PAEP protein, human)', '0 (Pregnancy Proteins)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '4G7DS2Q64Y (Progesterone)', '9035-54-5 (Placental Lactogen)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (Pregnancy-Associated Plasma Protein-A)']",,20050729,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These molecules were synthesized by epoxidation of the relevant chalcones, followed by reaction with hydrazine. The structures of epoxides 3 and 7, and pyrazole 17, were confirmed by X-ray diffraction studies. The relatively coplanar conformation of a 3',3'',4',4'',5',5''-hexamethoxypyrazole 17 was in good agreement with the shape for 3',3'',4',4'',5'-pentamethoxypyrazole 16, which was determined from molecular mechanics optimization. In vitro cytotoxicity of each class of compounds was obtained using a 72 h continuous exposure MTT assay against two murine cancer cell lines; B16 melanoma and L1210 leukemia. The effect of substitution in the A-ring is addressed: three methoxy groups versus two, generally increased cytotoxicity across both cell lines. In the majority of cases, the pyrazoles are generally more active than the epoxides, with the most active, 5-(3''-amino-4''-methoxyphenyl)-3-(3',4',5'-trimethoxyphenyl)pyrazole 21, possessing an IC(50) value of 5 and 2.4 microM (B16 and L1210, respectively). Due to their planar conformations, the pyrazoles are typically less active than the corresponding chalcones, which adopt angular conformations similar to CA-4. B-ring modifications confirmed that in general the amino compounds are more active than the corresponding nitro compounds. Varying the number and orientation of methoxy groups on the A-ring did not produce any significant differences in toxicity in the cell lines studied.","['0 (Bibenzyls)', '0 (Epoxy Compounds)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Stilbenes)', '3QD5KJZ7ZJ (pyrazole)', '7O62J06F18 (combretastatin)']",,,,,['RR 16461-10/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Yet, each cell chooses a single odorant receptor gene to express, which may then serve as the molecular identification of that cell. This process of differentiation or receptor gene regulation of olfactory sensory neurons has largely been enigmatic. Here, we showed that the important proto-oncogene in B lymphocyte terminal differentiation, B-Cell Leukemia/Lymphoma 6 (BCL-6), which codes for a sequence-specific transcription repressor, is expressed in olfactory sensory neurons in the mouse. We detected BCL-6 mRNA in most, if not all, mature olfactory sensory neurons by in situ hybridization histochemistry. Western blot analysis also revealed the presence of BCL-6 protein in the olfactory epithelium, but immunohistochemical analysis using anti-BCL-6 antibodies showed that only a subset of olfactory sensory neurons highly expressed BCL-6 protein. BCL-6 mRNA was detected as early as embryonic day 14 (E14) in most olfactory sensory neurons as in adults, and at E15, BCL-6 protein was detected in most cells that were likely to be differentiating into mature olfactory sensory neurons. Artificial induction of apoptosis of olfactory sensory neurons resulted in the decrease of BCL-6 mRNA, but during the subsequent phase of regeneration and differentiation, it markedly increased. Taken together, our results suggest the possibility that BCL-6 plays an important role in terminal differentiation not only in B lymphocytes but also in olfactory sensory neurons.","['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-6)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has more than 180 compounds including flavonoids, phenolic acids and its esters which have anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, antiviral, immunomodulatory, antioxidant and antiproliferative effects. Propolis is shown to inhibit cell division and protein synthesis. However the exact mechanism underlying antitumor effect is not clearly described. On the other hand progressive telomere shortening to a critical level results with senescence of normal cells by inducing apoptosis and telomerase prevents erosion of telomeres. In this study we aimed to evaluate hTERT ratios in propolis-treated T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (CCFR-CEM) cell line. Cell counts and cell viability of propolis-treated and propolis-free T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (CCFR-CEM) cell line were assessed by trypan blue dye exclusion test and MTT assay. The LightCycler instrument was used (online real-time PCR) for the quantification of hTERT in CCFR-CEM cell line. The hTERT ratio significantly decreased 60 and 93% after 24 and 72 h respectively compared to the initial value of the cells incubated with propolis. It had almost no cytotoxic effect and caused 30, 30, 22 and 12% decrease in cell counts after 24, 48, 72 and 96 h respectively which is statistically significant. In conclusion propolis may show antitumor and apoptotic effect via inhibiting telomerase expression besides the mechanisms which have been described previously.","['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '9009-62-5 (Propolis)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On the other hand, marijuana smoke contains several of the same carcinogens and co-carcinogens as the tar from tobacco, raising concerns that smoking of marijuana may be a risk factor for tobacco-related cancers. We reviewed two cohort studies and 14 case-control studies with assessment of the association of marijuana use and cancer risk. In the cohort studies, increased risks of lung or colorectal cancer due to marijuana smoking were not observed, but increased risks of prostate and cervical cancers among non-tobacco smokers, as well as adult-onset glioma among tobacco and non-tobacco smokers, were observed. The 14 case-control studies included four studies on head and neck cancers, two studies on lung cancer, two studies on non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, one study on anal cancer, one study on penile cancer, and four studies on childhood cancers with assessment of parental exposures. Zhang and colleagues reported that marijuana use may increase risk of head and neck cancers in a hospital-based case-control study in the United States, with dose-response relations for both frequency and duration of use. However, Rosenblatt and co-workers reported no association between oral cancer and marijuana use in a population-based case-control study. An eightfold increase in risk among marijuana users was observed in a lung cancer study in Tunisia. However, there was no assessment of the dose response, and marijuana may have been mixed with tobacco. Parental marijuana use during gestation was associated with increased risks of childhood leukemia, astrocytoma, and rhabdomyosarcoma, but dose-response relations were not assessed. In summary, sufficient studies are not available to adequately evaluate marijuana impact on cancer risk. Several limitations of previous studies include possible underreporting where marijuana use is illegal, small sample sizes, and too few heavy marijuana users in the study sample. Recommendations for future studies are to (1) focus on tobacco-related cancer sites; (2) obtain detailed marijuana exposure assessment, including frequency, duration, and amount of personal use as well as mode of use (smoked in a cigarette, pipe, or bong; taken orally); (3) adjust for tobacco smoking and conduct analyses on nonusers of tobacco; and (4) conduct larger studies, meta-analyses, or pooled analyses to maximize statistical precision and investigate sources of differences in results.

Epub 2005 Jul 28.,"Rituximab, a human/mouse chimeric anti-CD20 antibody, has become part of standard therapy for patients with CD20-expressing B-cell lymphoma, and is currently under investigation for other indications including autoimmune diseases, in particular rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Its characteristic tolerability profile was established soon after clinical testing began and compares favourably with chemotherapy. The majority of patients experience mild to moderate infusion-related reactions (IRRs) during the first administration of rituximab, but the incidence decreases markedly with subsequent infusions. Current data suggest that the type of adverse events in patients with RA are similar to those in lymphoma, but that adverse events related to the rituximab infusions are less severe and less frequent. Rituximab induces a rapid depletion of normal CD20-expressing B-cells in the peripheral blood, and levels remain low or undetectable for 2-6 months before returning to pretreatment levels, generally within 12 months. Serum immunoglobulin levels remain largely stable, although a reduction in IgM has been described. T-cells are unaffected by rituximab and consequently opportunistic infections rarely occur in association with rituximab therapy. When used in combination with a variety of chemotherapeutic regimens, rituximab does not add to the toxicity of chemotherapy, with the exception of a higher rate of neutropenia. However, this does not translate into a higher infection rate. Over 540,000 patients worldwide have now received rituximab and serious adverse reactions have occurred in a small minority of patients, but for the great majority of patients, rituximab is safe and well tolerated.","['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)']",143,20050728,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, we systematically evaluated four genetic modulators, (i) the woodchuck posttranscriptional regulatory element (WPRE), (ii) the mouse RNA transport element (RTE), (iii) the constitutive transport element (CTE) of the simian retrovirus type 1 (SRV-1), and (iv) the 5' untranslated region of the human heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70 5'UTR), all of them involved in the posttranscriptional control of mRNA nucleo/cytoplasmatic transport, RNA stability, and translation efficiency, in an MLV-based retrovirus vector context. Insertion of the WPRE into the retrovirus vector resulted in enhancement of transgene expression (EGFP) both in transfected virus producing cells as well as in infected recipient cells irrespective of the location in the vector. The best effect was observed with two copies of the WPRE, 3' of the transgene and in the 3' untranslated region of the vector backbone. However, oligomerization of this element does not further increase transgene expression. Presence of the WPRE resulted also in an increase in virus production. Introduction of the CTE and/or RTE in the retroviral vector did not alter transgene expression and infectious particle production. Positive effects were observed only in vectors harboring the CTE and/or RTE in combination with the WPRE. The activity of the Hsp70 5'UTR as a translational enhancer was found to be negligible in the context of the retroviral vector. However, interference of the Hsp70 5'UTR strong secondary structure with the packaging sequence of the viral RNA was experimentally excluded as being the cause of this. These data suggest that only the WPRE is a suitable element for the improvement of transgene expression and oncoretroviral vector production.","[""0 (5' Untranslated Regions)"", '0 (HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (enhanced green fluorescent protein)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The potential development of these aptameric oligomers needs that they retain serum and intracellular stabilities. Polycations are safe non-viral carriers of the nucleic acids. We demonstrated that a weakly basic polycation, the ethoxylated polyethylenimine (EPEI), can efficiently deliver cytotoxic GT oligomers when they were complexed as partial pre-paired duplex. In this way, nuclease-resistance of the oligomer was markedly improved and the administration of the duplex complexed with EPEI to lymphoblastic cancer cells caused a specific cytotoxic effect at concentrations lower than that of naked GT. However, the cytotoxic activity of the oligomer-EPEI complex resulted strictly related to the GC content and Tm of the duplex region. The single-stranded GT and the duplex with high GC content and Tm, although complexed with EPEI failed to exert cytotoxicity. Overall results indicated that aptameric oligomers complexed with polycations can be efficiently delivered into the cells and display the desired biological effect designing a balanced partial duplex whose stability can allow oligomer release from the polycation under the physiological cellular conditions.","['0 (Cell Extracts)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oligonucleotides)', '0 (Polyamines)', '0 (Polyelectrolytes)', '0 (polycations)', '5Z93L87A1R (Guanine)', '9002-98-6 (Polyethyleneimine)', 'QR26YLT7LT (Thymine)']",,20050408,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After virus exposure, different courses and outcomes of FeLV infection may prevail; they have been associated with cellular and humoral immune responses and the FeLV proviral load in peripheral blood. We hypothesized that the plasma viral RNA load might be an additional relevant indicator for the infection outcome. To quantify these loads, a real-time reverse transcriptase (RT) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay was developed. The assay amplifies FeLV-A, -B, and -C as some naturally infected cats could not be identified with a FeLV-A-based assay previously. The assay was applied to determine plasma FeLV RNA loads in cats infected both naturally and experimentally with FeLV. In addition, an improved real-time PCR assay for quantitation of FeLV proviral loads is described. The assays developed were more sensitive than ELISA and virus isolation in the early phase of infection. In addition, PCR allows the identification of provirus carriers that have overcome antigenaemia.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Chest radiographs of 881 Caucasian pediatric controls and 906 childhood cancer patients were reviewed, and independently scored by four blinded observers, using strict definitions. Prevalences of 6 major rib anomaly categories in controls were compared to their prevalence in the total group of childhood cancer patients, and the 12 individual larger tumor groups using Chi-square tests. RESULTS: Values in the control population were generated for the occurrence of six major rib anomaly categories; cervical rib anomalies were present in 6.1% of controls, aplasia of 12th ribs in 6.6%, lumbar ribs in 0.9%, bifurcations in 0.7%, synostosis-bridging in 0.3%, and segmentations were not found. The overall prevalence of total rib anomalies in cases and controls was equal (14.9% and 14.2%, respectively). Cervical rib anomalies were found significantly more often in cases (8.6%) compared to controls (p-value=0.047), three groups accounting for this higher prevalence: 12.1% of acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients (p=0.011), 18.2% of astrocytoma patients (p=0.023), and 14.7% of germ cell tumor patients (p=0.046) had a cervical rib anomaly. CONCLUSION: Prevalence figures for the presence and type of rib anomalies in a large group of normal Caucasian children were generated.

SHP-2 is a cytoplasmic Src-homology 2 domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase that plays an important role in intracellular signaling and is required during development and hematopoiesis. Germ-line missense mutations in PTPN11, the gene coding SHP-2, have been discovered as a major molecular event underlying Noonan syndrome, an autosomal dominant trait characterized by short stature, dysmorphic facies, and congenital heart defects, as well as in other closely related developmental disorders. More recently, a distinct class of missense mutations in the same gene has been identified to occur as a somatic event contributing to myeloid and lymphoid malignancies.

While HOX11 expression is normally silenced through an unknown mechanism in all tissues by adulthood, the deregulation of HOX11 expression is associated with leukemia, such as T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The elucidation of regulatory elements contributing to the molecular mechanism underlying the regulation of HOX11 gene expression is of great importance. Previous reports of HOX11 regulatory elements mainly focused on the 5\'-flanking region of HOX11 on the chromosome related to transcriptional control. To expand the search of putative cis-elements involved in HOX11 regulation at the post-transcriptional level, we analyzed HOX11 mRNA 3\'-untranslated region (3\'UTR) and found an AU-rich region. To characterize this AU-rich region, in vitro analysis of HOX11 mRNA 3\'UTR was performed with human RNAbinding protein HuR, which interacts with AU-rich element (ARE) existing in the 3\'UTR of many growth factors' and cytokines' mRNAs. Our results showed that the HOX11 mRNA 3\'UTR can specifically bind with human HuR protein in vitro. This specific binding could be competed effectively by typical ARE containing RNA. After the deletion of the AU-rich region present in the HOX11 mRNA 3\'UTR, the interaction of HOX11 mRNA 3\'UTR with HuR protein was abolished. These findings suggest that HOX11 mRNA 3\'UTR contains cis-acting element which shares similarity in the action pattern with ARE-HuR interactions and may involve in the posttranscriptional regulation of the HOX11 gene.","[""0 (3' Untranslated Regions)"", '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (ELAV Proteins)', '0 (ELAV-Like Protein 1)', '0 (ELAVL1 protein, human)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '143275-75-6 (TLX1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The onset of Richter's syndrome is characterized by worsening systemic symptoms, rapid tumor growth, and/or extranodal involvement. Median survival with conventional chemotherapy is less than 6 months. Therapy with more recent therapeutic regimens, such as hyperCVXD (fractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, liposomal daunorubicin, and dexamethasone), augmented hyperCVXD, and yttrium-90 ibritumomab tiuxetan, has not produced major improvements in response rates or overall survival. Improvement in the outcome of patients with Richter's syndrome may be aided by a more comprehensive understanding of the pathogenesis of Richter's syndrome; therapy could then be targeted against specific abnormalities. Current data indicate that the transformation of chronic lymphocytic leukemia to a large-cell or immunoblastic lymphoma is associated with abnormalities in cell cycle regulation (e.g., loss of the cell cycle inhibitors p16(INK4a) and p27(KIP1) ) and DNA repair (e.g., mutations and/or deletions of the p53, ATM, and p14(ARF) genes and epigenetic silencing of the MLH1 gene).

We found that neither axotomy, nor MND alone brought about a response by Nestin-positive NPCs. However, the combination of the two resulted in mobilization of NPCs in the spinal cord. We also found that there was an increase in the number of NPCs following SCI which was further enhanced by systemic administration of the neuregulatory cytokine, leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF). NPCs were demonstrated to differentiate into astrocytes in axotomized MND mice.

We also examined deletion of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 4 (INK4) genes and mutation of p53 gene in combination with changes in the HTLV-I genome in acute type ATL to test whether host genetic changes promoted the malignant transformation of ATL cells that carry putative CTL escape mutations. The premature stop codon in tax gene existed in many non-ATL HTLV-I carriers as a minor population but not in the commonest HTLV-I sequence of the individual. This minor population with a premature stop codon did not expand subsequently in 3 asymptomatic carriers tested. There were cases who had a mutation or deletion in HTLV-I who also have either deletion of INK4 genes or mutation in p53 gene. Our findings suggest that CTL escape mutation can occur at an early stage of ATL development, and that certain host genetic changes favor the development of the aggressive form of ATL.","['0 (Codon, Nonsense)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor Proteins)']",,,"['Copyright 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In our present study, we further characterized the effects of oh8dG in KG-1 cells and found that, in addition to apoptosis, oh8dG induced the arrest of KG-1 at the G1 phase. Simultaneously, oh8dG-treated KG-1 showed an increase in the oh8Gua content of DNA, upregulation of p21 (an inhibitor of cdk), and Ras inactivation. Moreover, the upregulation of p21 was followed by the inactivations of cdk4 and cdk2, the hypophosphorylation of Rb, and a marked decline in the expression of c-myc (a gene regulated by E2F that is a transcription factor whose activity is suppressed when it is bound to hypophosphorylated Rb). Ras inactivation was also followed by the inactivation of ERK kinase (MEK) and the inactivation of AP-1, a downstream target of the Ras signaling pathway. The specific MEK inhibitors, PD98059 and U0126, also induced G1 arrest. These findings suggest that p21 upregulation and Ras inactivation contribute to G1 arrest. An increase of oh8Gua content in DNA does not seem to be a principal contributor to G1 arrest, however, because the kinetics of increases of oh8Gua content in DNA and of G1 cell number did not coincide. We report that oh8dG induces the arrest of KG-1 growth at the G1 phase mainly by upregulating p21 and inactivating Ras.","['0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '5614-64-2 (8-hydroxyguanine)', '5Z93L87A1R (Guanine)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras))']",,,"['Copyright 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients with early stage NSCLC have a reasonable chance of cure with surgery, but unfortunately, fewer than half of all newly diagnosed NSCLC patients are surgical candidates. In addition, less than half of all patients treated with surgical resection alone are ultimately cured of their disease. As a result, several studies have emerged over the past decade examining the role of adjuvant chemotherapy as a means of improving outcomes in early-stage NSCLC. This article highlights the background and rationale, as well as the major findings, of each of these studies, namely, the British Medical Journal meta-analysis, the Adjuvant Lung Project Italy study, the Japanese Lung Cancer Research Group study, the International Adjuvant Lung Cancer Trial, the Cancer and Leukemia Group B 9633 study, and the JBR.10 study.

As part of a systematic dissection of SCL transcriptional regulation, we have previously identified a 5,245-bp SCL +18/19 enhancer that targeted embryonic endothelium together with embryonic and adult hematopoietic progenitors and stem cells (HSCs). This enhancer is proving to be a powerful tool for manipulating hematopoietic progenitors and stem cells, but the design and interpretation of such transgenic studies require a detailed understanding of enhancer activity in vivo. In this study, we demonstrate that the +18/19 enhancer is active in mast cells, megakaryocytes, and adult endothelium. A 644-bp +19 core enhancer exhibited similar temporal and spatial activity to the 5,245-bp +18/19 fragment both during development and in adult mice. Unlike the +18/19 enhancer, the +19 core enhancer was only active in adult mice when linked to the eukaryotic reporter gene human placental alkaline phosphatase. Activity of a single core enhancer in HSCs, endothelium, mast cells, and megakaryocytes suggests possible overlaps in their respective transcriptional programs. Moreover, activity in a proportion of thymocytes and other SCL-negative cell types suggests the existence of a silencer elsewhere in the SCL locus.","['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Tal1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.2.1.23 (beta-Galactosidase)']",,20050728,,,['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 1989 and 1993, 710 pre- and perimenopausal women with axillary node-positive breast cancer were randomly assigned to either cyclophosphamide 75 mg/m(2) orally days 1 through 14, epirubicin 60 mg/m(2) intravenously days 1 and 8, and fluorouracil 500 mg/m(2) intravenously days 1 and 8 (CEF) or CMF (cyclophosphamide 100 mg/m(2) orally days 1 through 14, methotrexate 40 mg/m(2) intravenously days 1 and 8, and fluorouracil 600 mg/m(2) intravenously days 1 and 8).

However, here we present data implicating a caveola-mediated endocytic entry route for A-MLV via its receptor Pit2. Caveolae belong to the cholesterol-rich microdomains characterized by resistance to nonionic detergents such as Triton X-100. Extraction of murine fibroblastic NIH 3T3 cells in cold Triton X-100 showed the presence of the A-MLV receptor Pit2 in detergent-insoluble microdomains. Using coimmunoprecipitation of cell extracts, we were able to demonstrate direct association of Pit2 with caveolin-1, the structural protein of caveolae. Other investigations revealed that A-MLV infection in contrast to vesicular stomatitis virus infection is a slow process (t(1/2) approximately 5 h), which is dependent on plasma membrane cholesterol but independent of NH4Cl treatment of cells; NH4Cl impairs entry via clathrin-coated pits. Furthermore, expression of dominant-negative caveolin-1 decreased the susceptibility to infection via Pit2 by approximately 70%. These results show that A-MLV can enter cells via a caveola-dependent entry route. Moreover, increase in A-MLV infection by treatment with okadaic acid as well as entry of fusion-defective fluorescent A-MLV virions in NIH 3T3 cells further confirmed our findings and show that A-MLV can enter mouse fibroblasts via an endocytic entry route involving caveolae. Finally, we also found colocalization of fusion-defective fluorescent A-MLV virions with caveolin-1 in NIH 3T3 cells. This is the first time substantial evidence has been presented implicating the existence of a caveola-dependent endocytic entry pathway for a retrovirus.","['0 (Cav1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Caveolin 1)', '0 (Caveolins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (leukemia virus receptor, gibbon ape)', '1W21G5Q4N2 (Okadaic Acid)', '97C5T2UQ7J (Cholesterol)']",,,,,,PMC1182675,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The current study examines this CD8+ T-cell dysfunction by analyzing the production and release of cytolytic molecules by CD8+ T cells. CD8+ T cells with an activated phenotype (CD43+) from acutely infected mice produced all three key components of lytic granules: perforin, granzyme A, and granzyme B. Furthermore, they displayed evidence of recent degranulation and in vivo cytotoxicity. In contrast, activated CD8+ T cells from chronically infected mice were deficient in cytolytic molecules and showed little evidence of recent degranulation and poor in vivo cytotoxicity. Evidence from tetramer-positive CD8+ T cells with known virus specificity confirmed the findings from the activated subset of CD8+ T cells. Interestingly, perforin and granzyme A mRNA levels were not significantly reduced during chronic infection, indicating control at a posttranscriptional level. Granzyme B deficiency was associated with a significant decrease in mRNA levels, but posttranscriptional control also appeared to contribute to deficiency. These results demonstrate a broad impairment of cytotoxic CD8+ T-cell effector function during chronic retroviral infection and explain the inability of virus-specific CD8+ T cells to eliminate persistent virus.","['0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Pore Forming Cytotoxic Proteins)', '126465-35-8 (Perforin)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Granzymes)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Gzmb protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Serine Endopeptidases)']",,,,,['Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],PMC1182617,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Genetic evidence indicates that these restriction factors target the virus capsid (CA) protein. Restriction can be overcome by adding virus at a high multiplicity of infection, indicating that the restriction factors can be saturated. Cells preexposed to restricted virus will allow infection by a second virus which would normally be restricted. This phenomenon is known as abrogation; it provides us with a tool with which to study the interaction of virus with restriction factors. We tested the abilities of several Gag processing mutants to abrogate restriction. Our results show that CA must be cleaved from both p12 and nucleocapsid in order for the incoming virion to interact with the restriction factor. Endogenous expression of properly processed CA, however, failed to abrogate restriction. These results suggest that as well as being processed, CA must also be properly assembled in the form of a condensed viral core in order to interact with Fv1 and Ref1.

Both viruses were adapted to replicate efficiently in the avian cell line DF-1, but RCASBP M2C (4070A) caused extensive cytopathic effects (CPE) in DF-1 cells whereas RCASBP M2C (797-8) induced low levels of CPE. The two viruses differed only at amino acid 242 of the polyproline-rich region in the surface (SU) subunit of the Env protein. In RCASBP M2C (4070A), an isoleucine replaced the wild-type proline residue, whereas a threonine residue was found in RCASBP M2C (797-8). In the present study, we show that other amino acid substitutions at position 242 strongly influence the CPE and replication rate of the chimeric viruses. There was a correlation between the amount of unintegrated linear retroviral DNA present in infected DF-1 cells and the level of CPE. This suggests that there may be a role for superinfection in the CPE. The treatment of RCASBP M2C (4070A)-infected cells with dantrolene, which inhibits the release of calcium from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), reduced the amount of CPE seen during infection with the highly cytotoxic virus. Dantrolene treatment did not appear to affect virus production, suggesting that Ca2+ release from the ER had a role in the CPE caused by these viruses.","['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (Peptides)', '25191-13-3 (polyproline)', 'F64QU97QCR (Dantrolene)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,,,,,PMC1182669,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ectopic expression models confirmed that pBR can directly mediate chemosensitizing by PK11195, presumably via mitochondrial activities, but showed that pBR expression is unnecessary to PK11195-mediated efflux inhibition. PK11195 binds plasma-membrane sites in Pgp-expressing cells, stimulates Pgp-associated adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) activity, and causes conformational changes in Pgp, suggesting that PK11195 modulates Pgp-mediated efflux by direct transporter interaction(s). PK11195 and CSA bind noncompetitively in Pgp-expressing cells, indicating that PK11195 interacts with Pgp at sites that are distinct from CSA-binding sites. Importantly, PK11195 concentrations that were effective in these in vitro assays can be safely achieved in patients.

AML samples were significantly more sensitive to tipifarnib compared to B-cell precursor ALL (BCP ALL) or N BM samples. Within AML, French-American-British (FAB) M5 samples were most sensitive to tipifarnib. T-cell ALL samples were significantly more sensitive than BCP ALL and N BM samples. In AML there was a marked correlation between tipifarnib resistance and daunorubicin or etoposide resistance, but not to cytarabine or 6-thioguanine. RAS mutations were present in 32% of AML and 18% of ALL samples, but there was no correlation between RAS mutational status and sensitivity to tipifarnib.

Treatment included intensive double-induction therapy and consolidation therapy with high cumulative doses of high-dose cytarabine. NPM1 mutations were identified in 48% of the patients including 12 novel sequence variants, all leading to a frameshift in the C-terminus of the nucleophosmin 1 (NPM1) protein.

Epub 2005 Jul 28.,"Inactivating mutations in the tumor suppressor gene phosphatase and tensin homologue on chromosome 10 (PTEN) result in elevated levels of phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate, activation of protein kinase B (PKB), and protection against apoptotic insults such as withdrawal of survival factors. Protection may arise through the inhibition of the pro-apoptotic protein Bim, which is normally repressed by a PKB-dependent mechanism. Here we show that PTEN-/- immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) exhibit elevated PKB phosphorylation and are resistant to serum withdrawal-induced death, but exhibit normal Bim expression following withdrawal of serum. In contrast, expression of Mcl-1, a prosurvival member of the Bcl-2 family, was elevated in PTEN-/- MEFs. Transient or stable overexpression of Mcl-1 in PTEN+/- MEFs conferred resistance to serum withdrawal, whereas ablating expression of Mcl-1 in PTEN-/- MEFs, using RNA interference, abolished their resistance to serum withdrawal-induced apoptosis. To determine if Mcl-1 is selected for overexpression in human tumors we examined human glioblastoma cell lines but found that loss of PTEN had no effect on Mcl-1 expression. In contrast, two of three PTEN-/- glioblastoma cell lines exhibited low expression of Bim, which was refractory to serum withdrawal. These results indicate that the resistance of PTEN-/- MEFs to serum withdrawal is largely due to the up-regulation of Mcl-1 but that loss of PTEN in tumor cell lines is more complex and may favor de-regulation of different apoptotic regulators such as Bim.","['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BCL2L11 protein, human)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Bcl2l11 protein, mouse)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)']",,20050728,,,"['BBS/E/B/0000C199/Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council/United', 'Kingdom', 'BBS/E/B/0000H151/Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council/United', 'Kingdom', 'BBS/E/B/0000H457/Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council/United', 'Kingdom']",,['J Biol Chem. 2005 Dec 9;280(49):41124'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present work, we show for the first time that As2O3 facilitates the DIDS-sensitive anion transport activity of band 3 protein in red blood cells (RBCs) isolated from normal adults and APL patients. To elucidate the effect of As2O3 on band 3 protein, constructs encoding the full length of the band 3 transmembrane domain (mdb3) and its C-terminal deletion forms were transfected into yeast cells by a yeast display system. The results demonstrate that deletion of the C-terminal 16 residues of mdb3 (mdb3-d16) does not affect anion transport activity of mdb3 or its sensitivity to DIDS, but decreases its sensitivity to As2O3 in the yeast cell. More intriguingly, the forced expression of intact mdb3 by transfection significantly induces cell apoptosis in HeLa cells, to a higher degree than in cells transfected with mdb3-d16 or empty vector. Expression of activated caspase 3 in HeLa cells also indicates that the C-terminal 16 residues are important for mdb3-mediated apoptosis in cells treated with As2O3.

On this line, we recently found that a novel adenosine analog, 2-chloro-N6-(3-iodobenzyl)-4'-thioadenosine-5'-N-methyluronamide (thio-Cl-IB-MECA) was a potent human A3AR agonist, and is superior to a known agonist Cl-IB-MECA [Jeong LS, Jin DZ, Kim HO, Shin DH, Moon HR, Gunaga P, et al. J Med Chem 2003;46:3775]. Here, we report that a novel A3AR agonist, thio-Cl-IB-MECA inhibited the growth of human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells by arresting cell cycle and induction of apoptosis. Thio-Cl-IB-MECA induced the cell cycle arrest of G0/G1 in the early time and at lower concentration (up to 25 microM). At higher concentration (50 microM), the apoptotic cell deaths were manifested by observation of the increase of sub-G0 phase of cell cycle distribution, DNA fragmentation and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage. In addition, the down-regulation of checkpoint protein cyclin D1 and c-myc by thio-Cl-IB-MECA was well correlated with the arrest of cell cycle transition of G1 to S phase. Further study revealed that the growth inhibitory activity of thio-Cl-IB-MECA is also related with the modulation of Wnt signaling pathway. The levels of beta-catenin, phosphorylated forms of GSK-beta and Akt were down-regulated by the treatment of thio-Cl-IB-MECA (10 nM) in a time-dependent manner, providing one of plausible mechanistic evidence for the involvement of the Wnt signaling pathway in the HL-60 cell growth inhibitory effects by thio-Cl-IB-MECA. These results suggest that a novel A3AR agonist, thio-Cl-IB-MECA can down-regulate Wnt signaling, inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis in HL-60 leukemia cells, and thus provide the possibility of this compound in the potential therapeutic value of the treatment of leukemia.","['0 (Adenosine A3 Receptor Agonists)', '0 (thio-Cl-IB-MECA)', 'K72T3FS567 (Adenosine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is similar to both the anthracycline doxorubicin and the anthracenedione mitoxantrone, but lacks the 5,8-dihydroxy substitution pattern of mitoxantrone, and has a tricyclic system unlike the tetracyclic structure seen with anthracyclines. Anthracyclines are the most active drugs in lymphoma therapy, but their use is limited by their cumulative and irreversible cardiotoxicity. Pixantrone was developed to improve the toxicity profile of the current anthracyclines and anthracenediones while maintaining their activity. Interestingly, pixantrone showed no measurable cardiotoxicity compared with its parent compound mitoxantrone or other anthracyclines at equi-effective doses in several animal models. Together with its superior cytotoxic activity in leukaemia and lymphoma models, these features render the drug a promising candidate for clinical development in indolent and aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

In this review, evidence is presented to demonstrate that hERG channels are frequently over- and/or mis-expressed in many tumour cell lines as well as in primary human cancers. Moreover, many tumour cells, especially leukaemia cells, express a truncated isoform (hERG1B) along with the full length hERG1 protein, to form heterotetrameric channels. Three main functions relevant to tumour cell biology can be ascribed to hERG channel activity: (i) the control of cell proliferation, especially in leukaemias; (ii) the regulation of tumour cell invasiveness, possible through a physical and functional interaction with adhesion receptors of the integrin family; and (iii) the control of tumour cell neoangiogensis, through the modulation of angiogenic factor secretion. hERG channels are thus considered novel diagnostic and prognostic factors in human cancers, as well as targets for anti-neoplastic therapies.","['0 (Cation Transport Proteins)', '0 (ERG1 Potassium Channel)', '0 (Ether-A-Go-Go Potassium Channels)', '0 (KCNH2 protein, human)', '0 (KCNH6 protein, human)', '0 (Potassium Channels, Voltage-Gated)']",29,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Self renewal is the property that distinguishes stem cells and progenitors, and in the blood-forming system explains why haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), not progenitors, are the only cells capable of providing rapid and sustained regeneration of the blood-forming system after ablation by cancer chemo- and radiotherapies. Cancer-free prospectively purified HSCs regenerate the haematopoietic system of patients as rapidly as a marrow or mobilized blood transplant, but without the risk of re-seeding the body with cancer cells. Further, purified allogeneic HSCs can establish donor-specific tolerance to subsequent tissue grafts. However, in contrast to widely-publicized reports of HSC plasticity, we have not been able to show transdifferentiation of HSC to muscle, heart, brain or gut, and conclude that rare cell fusions and incomplete purifications are likely explanations for the other published results. The ability to self-renew is also potentially dangerous, as poorly regulated self renewal is, we believe, a central lesion in all cancers. We have recently shown that myeloid leukaemias in mouse and human are often driven by rare leukaemia (cancer) stem cells which are at the progenitor stage of differentiation, but have activated the self-renewing cell division pathway normally used only by HSCs. Similar cancer stem cells have been isolated in other tumours.",,136,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We performed an array CGH analysis for 27 NK-cell lymphoma/leukemia cases that were classified into two disease groups based on the World Health Organization Classification (10 aggressive NK-cell leukemia cases and 17 extranodal NK/T-cell [NK/T] lymphomas, nasal type). We identified the differences in the genomic alteration patterns of the two groups. The recurrent regions characteristic of the aggressive NK-cell leukemia group compared with those of the extranodal NK/T lymphoma, nasal-type group, were gain of 1q and loss of 7p15.1-p22.3 and 17p13.1. In particular, gain of 1q23.1-24.2 (P = 0.041) and 1q31.3-q44 (P = 0.003-0.047), and loss of 7p15.1-p22.3 (P = 0.012-0.041) and 17p13.1 (P = 0.012) occurred significantly more frequently in the former than in the latter group.

We then found that MSC inhibit T-cell proliferation triggered either by allogeneic, mitogenic or antigen-specific stimuli. Interestingly, MSC inhibit T-cell proliferation by inducing apoptosis of activated T cells, but have no effect on resting T cells. Furthermore, we show that this apoptosis could be related to the conversion of tryptophan into kynurenine by indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase expressed by MSC in the presence of IFNgamma. Moreover, we show that the inhibitory effect of MSC is neither abrogated nor modified during expansion in culture or after irradiation.

Epub 2005 Jul 25.,"BACKGROUND: Treatment of hemopoietic system neoplasias involves severe complications associated with immunosuppression. We present two cases of treating severe sepsis utilizing recombinant human activated protein C (rhAPC) in the course of bilateral pneumonia in patients with hairy cell leukemia (HCL) and T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). RhAPC, limited the coagulation cascade by inactivating FVa and FVIIIa, directly and indirectly limiting systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), and improved the fibrinolysis process. These actions break the pathomechanism of sepsis and improve survival. CASE REPORT: Besides intensive, multidirectional treatment of severe sepsis, Xigris (activated drotrecogin alfa) was administered on the second day in both cases. The infusion continued, as recommended, for 96 hours without complications. During treatment the patients' general condition and respiratory efficiency improved, allowing respirator weaning on days 5 and 8 of therapy. These cases of severe sepsis and immunosuppression indicate a high therapeutic efficacy of drotrecogin alfa (activated). Treatment outcome was uncertain because of the patients' hematological condition, so rapid restoration of respiratory efficiency and no disease progression after discontinuing treatment was a great success, possibly due to implementing Xigris at a relatively early stage of sepsis and the intensive therapy conducted according to Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines. CONCLUSIONS: Patient survival in severe sepsis directly depends on early diagnosis and institution of treatment. 1. These cases confirm the effectiveness of drotrecogin alfa in severe sepsis as part of multidirectional therapy. 2. Microorganisms causing atypical pneumonia should be considered in diagnosing infections in patients treated with cytostatic agents.","['0 (Protein C)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",,20050725,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The patient relapsed 5 months after transplantation and received additional chemotherapy. He acquired an angioinvasive fungal infection that required transfusion of granulocytes. Approximately 5 weeks after relapsing (181 days after transplant), a bone marrow specimen was taken for molecular engraftment analysis and flow cytometry to assess graft loss as well as residual disease. The engraftment results generated by the multiple short tandem repeat loci tested were inconsistent, and alleles were present at several loci that were of neither patient nor donor origin. An error in specimen identification was initially considered. Further investigation into the circumstances surrounding procurement of the patient's bone marrow aspirate revealed that the patient had received a granulocyte transfusion approximately 10 hours before the bone marrow specimen was taken. In addition, morphological and flow cytometric analyses of the same bone marrow aspirate demonstrated a significant degree of peripheral blood contamination. We determined that the unknown alleles in the bone marrow engraftment specimen were derived from the donor of the transfused granulocytes. This case illustrates that white cell transfusion can lead to erroneous bone marrow engraftment results, particularly if only one microsatellite locus is used to monitor engraftment.",['9007-49-2 (DNA)'],,,,,,PMC1867546,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In an attempt to determine how such assays would perform in a clinical laboratory, we evaluated the analytical variability of Affymetrix microarray probesets using two generations of human Affymetrix chips (U95Av2 and U133A). The study was designed to mimic potential clinical applications by using multiple operators, machines, and reagent lots, and by performing analyses throughout a period of several months. A mixed model analysis was used to evaluate the relative contributions of multiple factors to overall variability, including operator, instrument, run, cRNA/cDNA synthesis, and changes in reagent lots. Under these conditions, the average probeset coefficient of variation (CV) was relatively low for present probesets on both generations of chips (mean coefficient of variation, 21.9% and 27.2% for U95Av2 and U133A chips, respectively). The largest contribution to overall variation was chip-to-chip (residual) variability, which was responsible for between 40 to 60% of the total variability observed. Changes in individual reagent lots and instrumentation contributed very little to the overall variability. We conclude that the approach demonstrated here could be applied to clinical validation of Affymetrix-based assays and that the analytical precision of this technique is sufficient to answer many biological questions.","['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Oligonucleotides)', '0 (RNA, Complementary)']",,,,,,PMC1867543,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although this translocation involving the paired homeobox-5 (PAX5) gene at chromosome band 9p13 and the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) gene at 14q32 has been described in approximately 50% of LPL cases, the actual number of cases studied is quite small. Many of the initial cases associated with t(9;14)(p13;q32) were actually low-grade B-cell lymphomas with plasmacytic differentiation other than LPL. Thus, we analyzed a series of low-grade B-cell lymphomas for PAX5 gene rearrangements. We searched records from the Department of Pathology, Stanford University Medical Center for low-grade B-cell lymphomas, with an emphasis on plasmacytic differentiation, that had available paraffin blocks or frozen tissue. We identified 37 cases, including 13 LPL, 18 marginal zone lymphomas (nodal, extranodal, splenic, and alpha-heavy chain disease), and 6 small lymphocytic lymphomas. A novel dual-color break-apart bacterial artificial chromosome probe was designed to flank the PAX5 gene, spanning previously described PAX5 breakpoints, and samples were analyzed by interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization. All cases failed to demonstrate a PAX5 translocation, indicating that t(9;14)(p13;q32) and other PAX5 translocations are uncommon events in low-grade B-cell lymphomas with plasmacytic differentiation. This study also confirms recent reports that found an absence of PAX5 rearrangements in LPL, suggesting the reassessment of PAX5 rearrangements in LPL.","['0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (PAX5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (PAX5 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",,,,,"['P01 CA034233/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA34233/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC1867539,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Different statistical methods for identifying differentially expressed genes can yield different results. To our knowledge, no experimental test has been performed to decide which method best identifies genes that are truly differentially expressed. We applied three statistical methods (dChip, t-test on log-transformed data, and Wilcoxon test) to identify differentially expressed genes in previously untreated patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). We used a training set of Affymetrix Hu133A microarray data from 11 patients with unmutated immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy chain variable region (VH) genes and 8 patients with mutated Ig VH genes. Differential expression was validated using semiquantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction assays and by validating models to predict the somatic mutation status of an independent test set of nine CLL samples. The methods identified 144 genes that were differentially expressed between cases of CLL with unmutated compared with mutated Ig VH genes. Eighty genes were identified by Wilcoxon test, 60 by t-test, and 65 by dChip, but only 11 were identified by all three methods. Greater agreement was found between the t-test and the Wilcoxon test. Differential expression was validated by semiquantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction assays for 83% of individual genes, regardless of the statistical method. However, the Wilcoxon test gave the most accurate predictions on new samples, and dChip, the least accurate. We found that all three methods were equally good for finding differentially expressed genes, but they found different genes. The genes selected by the nonparametric Wilcoxon test are the most robust for predicting the status of new cases. A comprehensive list of all differentially expressed genes can only be obtained by combining the results of multiple statistical tests.","['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)']",,,,,,PMC1867538,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Five cases of small lymphocytic lymphoma/chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) associated with granulomatous reactions in lymph nodes and bone marrow were identified, all clinically associated with signs of progressive disease. METHODS: Cases were acquired by reviewing an electronic database comprising approximately 715,000 patients diagnosed between 1993 and 2003. Histochemical, immunohistochemical, and molecular techniques were used to verify diagnosis and associated infectious diseases. Clinical data were obtained from reviewing the charts. RESULTS: Of 2044 bone marrow and 411 lymph node non-Hodgkin lymphoma biopsy samples, CLL was most frequently associated with bone marrow (two cases) and lymph node granulomas (three cases). These granulomas were mostly composed of epithelioid cells, with or without giant cells, and in all but one case did not show necrosis. All patients with CLL had clinical symptoms primarily caused by the granulomatous disease: two suffered from acid fast bacilli infections (Mycobacterium tuberculosis and mycobacteria other than tuberculosis) and three presented with clinical manifestations of sarcoidosis (the reason a diagnostic biopsy was performed). CONCLUSIONS: Granulomatous reactions in patients with CLL might obscure diagnosis and imitate disease progression and Richter's transformation. Careful histological examination, exclusion of infectious agents, and a detailed clinical history are essential for correct diagnosis.",,31,,,,,PMC1770862,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our laboratory has developed a novel host-guest approach to study drug-DNA interactions in which the host, the N-terminal fragment of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (MMLV RT) is co-crystallized with a DNA oligonucleotide guest in the presence and absence of drug. We have co-crystallized netropsin with the RT fragment bound to the symmetric 16mer d(CTTAATTCGAATTAAG)2 and determined the structure of the complex at 1.85 A. In contrast to previously reported netropsin-DNA structures, our oligonucleotide contains two AATT sites that bind netropsin with flanking 5' and 3' sequences that are not symmetric. The asymmetric unit of the RT fragment-DNA-netropsin crystals contains one protein molecule and one-half of the 16mer with one netropsin molecule bound. The guanidinium moiety of netropsin binds in a narrow part of the minor groove, while the amidinium is bound in the widest region within the site. We compare this structure to other Class I netropsin-DNA structures and find that the asymmetry of minor groove widths in the AATT site contributes to the orientation of netropsin within the groove while hydrogen bonding patterns vary in the different structures.","['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Deoxyribonucleotides)', '64B3O0RD7N (Netropsin)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",,20050727,,,"['R01 GM055026/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM062831/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'GM55026/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'GM62831/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",PMC1181240,,,,,,,,,,['GENBANK/H33258'],,,,

Using Southern blot hybridization (SBH) and sequenced tagged site polymerase chain reaction assays, we examined the proviral status in 558 clinical specimens from 350 patients who are suspected to have ATL. A total of 321 specimens (57.5%) from 241 patients showed positive results for the monoclonal integration according to SBH, using EcoR1 and Pst1. The 241 patients consisted of 136 patients (56.4%) with the complete provirus (C-type), 62 patients (25.7%) with a defective provirus (D-type), and 43 patients (17.8%) with multibands (M-type). The incidence of the D- and M-types were in the order of smoldering, chronic, and acute subtypes of ATL, suggesting that such an aberrant proviral status is generated on the way to multistep carcinogenesis and is subsequently clinically important for the malignant behavior of the disease. Moreover, our data showed that the partial deletion of the proviral genome is initiated first at the site of the gag region and spreads into the sites of the pol and env regions, whereas the long terminal repeats and pX regions are almost always conserved. These results suggest that analysis of the proviral status provides useful diagnostic and virologic-oncological information about ATL and HTLV-1 pathology, especially the important role of pX gene in tumorigenesis.","['0 (DNA, Viral)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of the present study was to clarify the role of STAT3 signalling in the protection of polyamine-depleted intestinal epithelial cells against TNF-alpha (tumour necrosis factor-alpha)-induced apoptosis. Polyamine depletion by DFMO (alpha-difluoromethylornithine) caused phosphorylation of STAT3 at Tyr-705 and Ser-727. Phospho-Tyr-705 STAT3 was immunolocalized at the cell periphery and nucleus, whereas phospho-Ser-727 STAT3 was predominantly detected in the nucleus of polyamine-depleted cells. Sustained phosphorylation of STAT3 at tyrosine residues was observed in polyamine-depleted cells after exposure to TNF-alpha. Inhibition of STAT3 activation by AG490 or cell-membrane-permeant inhibitory peptide (PpYLKTK; where pY represents phospho-Tyr) increased the sensitivity of polyamine-depleted cells to apoptosis. Expression of DN-STAT3 (dominant negative-STAT3) completely eliminated the protective effect of DFMO against TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis. Polyamine depletion increased mRNA and protein levels for Bcl-2, Mcl-1 (myeloid cell leukaemia-1) and c-IAP2 (inhibitor of apoptosis protein-2). Significantly higher levels of Bcl-2 and c-IAP2 proteins were observed in polyamine-depleted cells before and after 9 h of TNF-alpha treatment. Inhibition of STAT3 by AG490 and DN-STAT3 decreased Bcl-2 promoter activity. DN-STAT3 decreased mRNA and protein levels for Bcl-2, Mcl-1 and c-IAP2 in polyamine-depleted cells. siRNA (small interfering RNA)-mediated inhibition of Bcl-2, Mcl-1 and c-IAP2 protein levels increased TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis. DN-STAT3 induced the activation of caspase-3 and PARP [poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase] cleavage in polyamine-depleted cells. These results suggest that activation of STAT3 in response to polyamine depletion increases the transcription and subsequent expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and IAP family proteins and thereby promotes survival of cells against TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis.","['0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Polyamines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'ZQN1G5V6SR (Eflornithine)']",,,,,"['R01 DK016505/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 DK016505/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK-16505/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",PMC1316269,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: The children and youth who had ALL had poorer balance than the comparison subjects (BOTMP = 10.55 and 16.30, respectively) and lower CSAPPA scores (57.72 and 63.72, respectively) and HUI scores (0.86 and 0.97, respectively). Regression analyses identified exposure to cranial irradiation, being overweight, lower CSAPPA scores for adequacy, and lower HUI single-attribute scores for cognition as predictors of lower balance scores in subjects who had ALL. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Balance abilities in subjects treated for ALL were compromised, and several factors were associated with this deficit.",,,,,,['CA68484/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Any extramedullary site can be involved by myeloid sarcoma, but involvement of the cecal appendix is uncommon, and symptoms mimicking acute appendicitis as a result of appendiceal involvement are rare. OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinicopathologic features of 2 patients with myeloid sarcoma involving the appendix who presented with right lower quadrant pain suggestive of acute appendicitis and prompting appendectomy. DESIGN: Clinical information for both patients was obtained from the medical record. Routine hematoxylin-eosin-stained slides, naphthol-ASD-chloroacetate stain, and immunohistochemical stains for myeloid, B-cell, and T-cell antigens were prepared. RESULTS: Peripheral blood and bone marrow were infiltrated by coexistent acute myeloid leukemia in case 1 but were negative for leukemia in case 2. In case 2, the patient had a history of acute myeloid leukemia that had been treated by an allogenic bone marrow transplant 7 months earlier. Histologic examination of the appendix revealed poorly differentiated myeloid sarcoma in both cases. Each neoplasm was positive for chloroacetate esterase, myeloperoxidase, lysozyme, and CD43 and was negative for CD3 and CD20. CONCLUSIONS: Myeloid sarcoma involving the appendix can rarely cause pain or other symptoms mimicking acute appendicitis. A high index of suspicion combined with the use of cytochemical and immunohistochemical studies are helpful in establishing the diagnosis.","['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One approach to overcome this problem is to deplete alloreactive cells selectively by deleting T cells activated by recipient stimulators, using an immunotoxin directed against the activation marker CD25. However, the degree of depletion of alloreactive cells is variable following stimulation with recipient PBMC, and this can result in GvHD. We have shown that using recipient EBV-transformed LCL as stimulators to activate donor alloreactive T cells results in more consistent depletion of in vitro alloreactivity while preserving T-cell responses to viral and potential myeloid tumor Ag. Based on these data, we have embarked on a phase I clinical dose escalation study of add-back of allo-LCL-depleted donor T cells in the haplo-identical setting, to determine if the allodepletion we achieve to allow infusion of sufficient T cells to restore useful antiviral/anti-leukemic responses without causing GvHD. Fifteen patients have so far been treated. The incidence of significant acute or chronic GvHD has been low (2/15), as has mortality from infection (1/15). Preliminary data show accelerated immune reconstitution in dose level 2 patients. Infused allodepleted donor T cells appear able to expand significantly in the face of viral reactivations, and doses as low as 3 x 10(5)/kg may be sufficient to confer useful antiviral immunity in this setting. At a median follow-up of 19.5 months, nine of 15 patients are alive and disease-free. Five patients have relapsed, all of whom have died.",,12,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PROCEDURE: Nine children with histologically verified intracranial germinomas treated in Slovenia between 1983 and 1995 were reviewed. The four boys and five girls were 8.8-16.9 years old (median, 11.3 years). Five tumors were suprasellar, three were in the pineal region, and one patient had bifocal disease. Two patients had disseminated tumor. All patients received radiotherapy: six to the tumor bed, one to the whole brain, and two to the whole central nervous axis (CNA). The doses to the tumor bed ranged from 30 to 46 Gy (median, 44 Gy) and to the CNA were 24 and 34.5 Gy. Five patients received neoadjuvant cyclophosphamide and three patients, all with beta-human chorionic gonadotropin secreting tumors, received neoadjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy. RESULTS: Six patients are alive 12.8-21.8 years (median, 19 years) from diagnosis. The causes of death in three patients were disseminated disease, toxicity of salvage chemotherapy, and secondary etoposide-induced leukemia. All patients with suprasellar tumors presented with overt endocrinopathy. Results of psychological evaluation were subnormal in one out of five patients tested. Estimate of mental deterioration due to therapy ranged from 0% to 30% (median, 15%). Emotional disorder was registered in four patients and psycho-organic syndrome in three. CONCLUSIONS: Our results on long-term survival and functional outcome confirm the efficacy and relative safety of limited-field and reduced-dose radiotherapy for childhood intracranial germinoma when supplemented with chemotherapy.",,,,"['Copyright 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",['Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2006 Jul;47(1):2-3.

METHODS: The current study included 23 patients who developed acute leukemia in a cohort of 414 consecutive PV patients with long-term observation (3208 person years of follow-up). Kaplan-Meier Product-Limit method was used to estimate the cumulative probability of survival; Gehan-Wilcoxon test was applied to compare survival in different groups of patients. RESULTS: Median age was 68 years, and 18 patients (78%) were > 60 years of age. At diagnosis of AL, most patients had a white blood count > 10 x 10(9)/L (n = 17; 74%), Hgb < 10 g/dL (n = 13; 57%), and platelet count > 50 x 10(9)/L (n = 17; 74%). Of 14 patients in whom cytogenetic analysis was available at leukemic transformation, 12 showed high-risk abnormalities including complex karyotype (n = 10), del (7)(q22) sole (n = 1) and del (X)(q26) sole (n = 1), whereas 2 had a normal karyotype. In patients whose karyotype was available at diagnosis of PV, cytogenetic evolution was documented at progression to AL. Treatment consisted of supportive care and/or low-dose chemotherapy (n = 15), or induction chemotherapy (n = 8). This included idarubicin plus cytarabine (n = 3), high-dose cytarabine (n = 4), and fludarabine-based regimen (n = 1). Allogenic stem cell transplantation was offered to a single patient, who is alive at Day + 70. The outcome of patients was poor, with a median survival of 2.9 months (range, 0.6-20.1 mos), with no significant differences between palliation and intensive treatments. CONCLUSIONS: AL following PV has distinct clinical and biologic features. Outcome of patients is poor irrespective of the treatment employed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2005 Nov 12.,"Relapsed or refractory adult acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALL) have poor prognosis. The strategy for treating these patients is through reinduction chemotherapy followed by allogeneic stem cell transplantation, provided that the toxicity of the salvage regimen is acceptable. Twenty three patients with relapsed/refractory adult ALL were treated with fludarabine, cytarabine, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, and idarubicin (FLAG-IDA). Five patients had primary refractory disease, and 18 were in first relapse. Nine (39.1%) patients achieved complete remission (CR) following salvage therapy, whereas 13 (56.5%) patients were refractory, and one patient died in aplasia due to infection. In patients achieving remission, the median time to reach absolute neutrophil count (ANC) more than 0.5x10(9)/l and 1x10(9)/l was 20 (range 16-25) and 24 (range 20-28) days from the start of chemotherapy, respectively. Platelet levels of more than 20x10(9)/l and 100x10(9)/l were achieved in a median time of 23 (range 19-25) and 33 (range 28-39) days, respectively. Fever more than 38.5 degrees C was observed in 18 of 23 patients (78.2%), 13 had fever of unknown origin, and 5 had documented infections. Nonhematological side effects, consisting mainly of mucositis (18/23 or 78.2%) and transient liver toxicity increase (10/23 or 43.4%), were generally tolerated. All nine patients who achieved CR received a second course with FLAG-IDA, and seven patients underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation (four from a matched donor, one from a mismatched donor, and two from an unrelated donor), while two did not reach that stage due to early relapse from CR. The median overall survival (OS) for all 23 patients was 4.5 (range 1-38) months; for the nine responders, the disease-free survival (DFS) and the OS were 6 (range 3-38) and 9 (7-38) months, respectively; the seven patients who received allogeneic stem cell transplantation had a DFS of 10 (range 7-38) months. In our experience, FLAG-IDA is a well-tolerated regimen in relapsed/refractory ALL patients; the toxicity is acceptable, enabling patients who have achieved CR to receive allogeneic transplantation.","['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)']",,20051112,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Purified platelets, obtained from AML-patients and normal control subjects, were examined for surface membrane GP1b-expression by flow cytometry and GP1b-mediated aggregation responses by aggregometry. The level of elastase in plasma from patients and controls was measured by enzymed-linked immunosorbent assay. The whole of this work was carried out at the University of Liverpool, Liverpool, United Kingdom during the period of 1994-2001. RESULTS: Platelets from the majority of AML-patients showed reduced GP1b-expression and reduced GP1b-mediated aggregation responses. Reduction in platelet GP1b-expression was associated with increased plasma elastase levels. CONCLUSION: The present study suggests that elastase, released from leukemic blasts, degrades platelet GP1b, resulting in dysfunctional circulating platelets in AML-patients. These results could explain the bleeding disorders observed in these patients.","['0 (Platelet Glycoprotein GPIb-IX Complex)', 'EC 3.4.21.36 (Pancreatic Elastase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A comparative study was made of the specificity and the effects of formalin fixation on immunohistochemistry quality of GI191E/A8 and two other anti-BCL-6 MAbs. To evaluate its possible application to differential diagnosis of lymphomas, two tissue microarrays (89 diffuse large B-cell lymphomas and 24 B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia cases) were stained with GI191E/A8 and another anti-BCL-6 MAb produced by conventional means. Using GI191E/A8, the detection of BCL-6 protein was significantly increased, and its specificity was independent of formalin-fixation time. Using automatic quantified analysis, the correlation between the two anti-BCL-6 MAbs tested was identical in cases with overexpression or absence of BCL-6. In cases with intermediate BCL-6 protein expression, detection with GI191E/A8 was more sensitive.

The time pattern of exposure accrual may influence subsequent temporal patterns of cancer risk. The authors present several simple models that may be used to evaluate the influence of time since exposure or age at exposure on cancer incidence or mortality in an occupational cohort. METHODS: A cohort of 40,415 nuclear industry workers was identified via the Canadian National Dose Registry. Vital status and cause of death were ascertained through 1994. Associations between ionising radiation and mortality due to lung cancer, leukaemia, and cancers other than lung and leukaemia were quantified using conditional logistic regression models with risk sets constructed by incidence density sampling. A step function, a bilinear function, and a sigmoid function were used to evaluate temporal variation in exposure effects. RESULTS: Step and sigmoid functions were used to explore latency and morbidity periods. For analyses of lung cancer, leukaemia, and other cancers the best fitting models were obtained when exposure assignment was lagged by 13, 0, and 5 years, respectively. A bilinear function was used to evaluate whether exposure effects diminished with time since exposure. In analyses of lung cancer and leukaemia, there was evidence that radiation effects attenuated with protracted time since exposure. In analyses of age at exposure, there was evidence of variation in radiation mortality associations for analyses of lung cancer and leukaemia; discounting radiation doses accrued at younger ages (for example, 15-35 years) led to significant improvements in model fit.

Cellular AML1c protein is found in the nucleus and can be separated into two fractions, one soluble in buffers containing salt and nonionic detergent and the other insoluble and tightly bound to the nuclear matrix. We find that the AML1c protein is modified by both phosphorylation and ubiquitination. Our studies show that the majority of the ubiquitinated AML1c is associated with the insoluble nuclear matrix. Treatment of cells with the proteasome inhibitor PS341 (Velcade, Bortezomib) increases the levels of ubiquitinated AML1c. Mutation of the four phosphorylation sites necessary for transcriptional regulation (serine 276, serine 293, serine 303, and threonine 300) mimics the effects of the proteasome inhibitor, increasing the levels of ubiquitinated, matrix-bound AML1c. We find that the soluble and insoluble forms of AML1c are degraded at a similar rate. However, mutation of these four serine/threonine residues statistically increases the half-life of the matrix-associated AML1c. Thus, phosphorylation of AML1c on specific serine/threonine residues controls both transcriptional activity and rate of degradation.","['0 (Boronic Acids)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Protease Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '0 (Runx1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Ubiquitin)', '2ZD004190S (Threonine)', '452VLY9402 (Serine)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)']",,,,,"['CA 42533/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 72009/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The leukemogenic role of the corresponding fusion gene MLL-AF4 is not well understood. We show that transient inhibition of MLL-AF4 expression with small interfering RNAs impairs the proliferation and clonogenicity of the t(4; 11)-positive human leukemic cell lines SEM and RS4;11. Reduction of mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL)-ALL-1 fused gene from chromosome 4 (AF4) levels induces apoptosis associated with caspase-3 activation and diminished BCL-X(L) expression. Suppression of MLL-AF4 is paralleled by a decreased expression of the homeotic genes HOXA7, HOXA9, and MEIS1. MLL-AF4 depletion inhibits expression of the stem-cell marker CD133, indicating hematopoietic differentiation. Transfection of leukemic cells with MLL-AF4 siRNAs reduces leukemia-associated morbidity and mortality in SCID mice that received a xenotransplant, suggesting that MLL-AF4 depletion negatively affects leukemia-initiating cells. Our findings demonstrate that MLL-AF4 is important for leukemic clonogenicity and engraftment of this highly aggressive leukemia. Targeted inhibition of MLL-AF4 fusion gene expression may lead to an effective and highly specific treatment of this therapy-resistant leukemia.","['0 (MLL-AF4 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)']",,20050726,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using comparative genomic hybridization (CGH), we investigated the genetic alterations of 224 cases of untreated DLBCL (87 GCB-DLBCL, 77 ABC-DLBCL, 19 PMBCL, and 41 unclassified DLBCL) previously characterized by gene-expression profiling. The DLBCL subgroups differed significantly in the frequency of particular chromosomal aberrations. ABC-DLBCL had frequent trisomy 3, gains of 3q and 18q21-q22, and losses of 6q21-q22, whereas GCB-DLBCL had frequent gains of 12q12, and PMBCL had gains of 9p21-pter and 2p14-p16. Parallel analysis of CGH alterations, locus-specific gene-expression profiles, and global gene-expression signatures revealed that DNA amplifications and gains had a substantial impact on the expression of genes in the involved chromosomal regions, and some genes were overexpressed in a DLBCL subgroup-specific fashion. Unexpectedly, specific chromosomal alterations were associated with significant changes in gene-expression signatures that reflect various aspects of lymphoma cell biology as well as the host response to the lymphoma. In addition, gains involving the chromosomal region 3p11-p12 provided prognostic information that was statistically independent of the previously defined gene-expression-based survival model, thereby improving its predictive power.",,,20050726,,,['UO1-CA84 967/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC1895326,,,,,,,,,['Lymphoma/Leukemia Molecular Profiling Project'],,,,,

The impact of ex vivo T-cell depletion (TCD) on cGVHD was analyzed in a randomized multicenter trial involving unrelated donor marrow transplants. A total of 404 patients diagnosed with hematologic malignancies received a total body irradiation-based myeloablative conditioning regimen. GVHD prophylaxis included TCD plus cyclosporine (CSA) or unmodified grafts with CSA plus methotrexate (M/C). Median recipient age was 31.2 years (range, 0.5-55.6 years); median follow-up time since randomization was 4.2 years. The mean number of T cells infused was 1 log lower on the TCD arm. The incidence of cGVHD at 2 years was similar between the TCD and M/C arms, 29% versus 34% (P = .27), respectively. Survival at 3 years from diagnosis of cGVHD was also similar, (TCD 51% versus M/C 58%; P = .29). The proportion of patients with cGVHD who discontinued immunosuppression at 5 years was not different (TCD 72% versus M/C 63%; P = .27), and incidence of serious infections and leukemia relapse were similar on both treatment arms.

This study explored the prevalence and the prognostic impact of NPM mutations in a cohort of 106 patients with normal-karyotype AML. NPM exon 12 mutations were detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and fragment analysis for the insertion/deletion globally resulting in a 4-bp insertion. NPM mutations were detected in 47% of patients and were associated with a high white blood cell count, involvement of the monocytic lineage (M4/M5), and a decreased prevalence of CEBPA mutations.

Epub 2005 Jul 26.,"Most lymphoblastic lymphomas (LBLs) are regarded as neoplasms of immature T cells because they express cytoplasmic CD3 and frequently carry T-cell receptor (TCR) gene rearrangements. Immature natural killer (NK) and T cells, however, have a common bipotent T/NK-cell precursor in the thymus, and NK cells also express cytoplasmic CD3. Thus, some LBLs could arise from immature NK cells. Mature NK cells express 2 CD94 transcripts: 1A, induced by interleukin 15 (IL-15), and 1B constitutively. Because immature NK cells require IL-15 for development, CD94 1A transcripts could be a marker of NK-LBL. To test this hypothesis, we used laser capture microdissection to isolate IL-15 receptor alpha(+) lymphoid cells from the thymus and showed that these cells contained CD94 1A transcripts. We then assessed for CD94 transcripts in 21 cases of LBL that were cytoplasmic CD3(+), nuclear terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase positive (TdT(+)), and CD56(-), consistent with either the T-cell or NK-cell lineage. We found that 7 LBLs expressed CD94 1A transcripts without TCR gene rearrangements, suggesting NK-cell lineage.

Epub 2005 Jul 26.,"Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) is a clonal myeloproliferative/myelodysplastic disorder of early childhood with a poor prognosis. JMML cells are characterized by hypersensitivity to granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) caused by a continuously activated GM-CSF receptor-retrovirus-associated sequence (RAS) signal transduction pathway through various molecular mechanisms, resulting in spontaneous GM colony formation in vitro. Bisphosphonate zoledronic acid (ZOL), a RAS-blocking compound, suppressed colony formation from bone marrow (BM) cells of 8 patients with JMML and 5 healthy control subjects without and with GM-CSF (10 ng/mL), respectively, in a dose-dependent manner in clonal culture. At 10 microM ZOL, however, spontaneous GM colony formation from JMML BM cells decreased to 3%, but the formation of G colonies containing granulocytes, but no macrophages, was enhanced, whereas 40% of GM colonies were retained and G colony formation was not affected in culture of normal BM cells with GM-CSF. In suspension culture, cytochemical and flow cytometric analyses showed that 10 microM ZOL also inhibited spontaneous proliferation and differentiation along monocyte/macrophage lineage of JMML BM cells but not the development of normal BM cells by GM-CSF. The inhibitory effect of ZOL on JMML cells was confirmed at a single-clone level and observed even at 3 microM. The current result offers a novel approach to therapy in JMML.","['0 (Diphosphonates)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Phosphates)', '6XC1PAD3KF (Zoledronic Acid)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)']",,20050726,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The HTLV-1 envelope gene exhibits limited variability when examined from infected individuals, but has not been tested using infectious clones of the virus in animal models. In vitro assays indicate that HTLV-1 envelope (Env) Ser75Ile, Asn95Asp, and Asn195Asp surface unit (SU) mutants are able to replicate in and immortalize lymphocytes. Herein, we examined the effects of these Env mutants in rabbits inoculated with HTLV-1 immortalized ACH.75, ACH.95, or ACH.195 cell lines (expressing full-length molecular clones with the SU mutations) or the ACH.1 cell line (expressing wild-type SU). All rabbits became infected, and the fidelity of the mutations was maintained throughout the 8-week study. However, SU point mutations resulted in decreased antibody responses to viral group-associated antigen (Gag) and Env antigens. ACH.195 rabbits had a selective decreased antibody response to SU, and one ACH.195 rabbit had an antibody response to both HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 SUs. Some mutant inoculation groups had altered proviral loads. However, peripheral-blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) proviral loads did not correlate with antibody responses. Our data are the first to demonstrate that mutations in critical determinants of HTLV-1 Env SU altered antibody responses and proviral loads, but do not prevent viral replication in vivo.","['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)']",,20050726,,,"['P01 CA100730-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-63417/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA09338/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA70529/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC1895059,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2005 Jul 25.,"The evidence for the promising potential for derivatives of Vitamin D (deltanoids) in the treatment of myeloid leukemias is increasing, but currently is not matched by the understanding of the precise mechanisms by which these anti-neoplastic effects are achieved. Unlike solid tumors in which growth retardation by deltanoids appears to result from inhibition of cell proliferation and the promotion of cell death by apoptosis, control of myeloid leukemia proliferation by deltanoids results from the induction of differentiation of the immature myelo-monocytic cells towards functional monocytic cells. We present here the accumulating evidence that a pathway that is initiated by deltanoid activation of Vitamin D receptor (VDR) and leads to monocytic differentiation of human myeloblastic HL60 cells, includes the MEK-ERK and JNK mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), their positive and negative regulators and a downstream effector C/EBPbeta. As in other cells, the abundance of VDR protein increases shortly after an exposure of HL60 cells to 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) (1alpha,25(OH)(2) D(3)). Other early events include a parallel upregulation of kinase suppressor of Ras (KSR-1) and the activation of the ERK MAPK pathway and data suggest that KSR-1 acts to amplify the signal provided by low concentrations of 1alpha,25(OH)(2) D(3). Maintenance of monocytic differentiation may be enhanced by JNK, but diminished by p38, MAPK signaling. Downstream, one of the targets of these pathways is C/EBPbeta, which can directly interact with the promoter for CD14, a gene characteristically expressed in monocytes. Importantly, in freshly obtained acute myeloid leukemia (AML)-M2 cells exposed to PRI-2191, a novel deltanoid with a modified side chain, upregulation of C/EBPbeta paralleled the induction of monocytic differentiation. These data provide a basis for the hypothesis that deltanoid-induced upregulation of C/EBPbeta bypasses the block to granulocytic differentiation in myeloid leukemia cells by redirecting the cells to monocytic differentiation.","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-beta)', '0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)', '1406-16-2 (Vitamin D)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (KSR-1 protein kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",,20050725,,,"['R01 CA044722/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA044722-15/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA44722/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2814418,,,['NIHMS169830'],,,,,,,,,,,

Introgression of a ca 30 cM region of rat chromosome 8 from PD/Cub onto the genetic background of SHR was previously shown to influence several of the metabolic syndrome-related traits along with causing the PLS in the SHR-Lx congenic strain. In the process of identification of the causative alleles, we have produced several congenic sublines. The differential segment of SHR-Lx PD5 congenic substrain [SHR.PD(D8Rat42-D8Arb23)/Cub] spans approximately 1.4 Mb encompassing only 14 genes. When comparing the metabolic, morphometric and gene expression profiles of the SHR-Lx PD5 vs. SHR, the polydactyly and several distinct metabolic features observed in the original SHR-Lx congenic were still manifested, suggesting that the responsible genes were ""trapped"" within the relatively short differential segment of PD/Cub origin in SHR-Lx PD5. Particularly, the SHR-Lx PD5 displayed substantial reduction of insulin sensitivity confined to skeletal muscle. Among the candidate genes, the promyelocytic leukaemia zinc-finger Plzf (Zbtb16) transcription repressor is most likely responsible for the Lx mutation resulting in PLS and could also be involved in the alteration of metabolic pathways. The sequence analysis of the Plzf gene revealed a SNP leading to a threonine to serine substitution in SHR at aminoacid position 208 (T208S). In summary, we have isolated a 1.4 Mb genomic region syntenic to human chromosome 11q23, which, apart from causing polydactyly-luxate syndrome (PLS), affects total body weight, adiposity, lipid profile, insulin sensitivity of skeletal muscle and related gene expression as shown in the SHR-Lx PD5 congenic substrain.","['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Insulin)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Data up to June 2004 (early report) is being presented. METHODS: Twelve Patients with refractory/relapsed (Ref/Rel) acute leukaemia (AL) were treated with fludarabine 30 mg/m2 and cytosine arabinoside (AraC) Arac 2 g/m2 for 5 days, idarubicin 10 mg/m2 for 3 days, and granulocyte colony stimulating factor G-CSF 5 micro g/kg from day 0 till neutrophil recovery (ANC > 1.0 x 10(9)/1). Response was evaluated by bone marrow examination on day 20-post chemotherapy. RESULTS: Patients included were refractory acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) (n=2), relapsed ALL (n = 3), refractory acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) (n = 3), secondary AML (n=2) relapsed AML (n = 1) and acute undifferentiated leukaemia (AUL) (n = 1). Complete remission (CR) was achieved in 8 (66.6%) patients. Three (25%) patients died of post chemotherapy complications and one patient failed to achieve remission. Out of 8 patients who achieved CR, 4 underwent allogeneic bone marrow transfusion (BMT), 1 is being evaluated for the same, 1 received idorubicin, AraC and etopuside (ICE) and high dose AraC, 1 did not receive further chemotherapy and 1 relapsed two months after remission. Seven patients are still in CR after a median follow up of 8 months (range 3-18). Major complications encountered were diarrhoea, mucositis, toxic ileus, transient hepatic toxicity, fungal and bacterial infections. CONCLUSION: In our experience, FLAG-IDA is well tolerated and effective regimen in relapsed/refractory acute leukaemias.

METHODS: The GST activity of bone marrow mononuclear cells and LRP expression in 57 acute leukemia patients were detected by the spectrophotometry assay and immuno-cytochemistry (SABC), respectively. RESULTS: The GST activity of bone marrow mononuclear cells in the acute leukemia group was significantly higher than that of the control group (P < 0.01). The GST activity of mononuclear cells in acute leukemia was positively correlated with the percentage of blast in the bone marrow (r = 0.30, P < 0.05). The GST activity of mononuclear cells in the untreated acute leukemia group was obviously higher than that of the complete remission group (P <0.01). The GST activity in the refractory or relapsed acute leukemia group was significantly higher than that of the complete remission group and untreated leukemia group (P <0.05). In post-chemotherapy 13 of 17 the LRP-positive patients were the non-remission, 12 of the 20 LRP-negative patients were the complete remission. The curative rate of the LRP-positive group was the significantly lower than the LRP-negative group (P < 0.05). The GST activities of non-remission patients in the LRP-positive and LRP-negative group obviously increased. CONCLUSION: The increase of GST activity in the bone marrow mononuclear cells is related to the clinical curative effects and the proliferation of blast in acute leukemia. Detection of LRP and GST activities in acute leukemia may have a reference value in judging the leukemia with drug resistance and estimating the prognosis.","['0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Vault Ribonucleoprotein Particles)', '0 (major vault protein)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It encodes an antigen recognized by autologous cytolytic T lymphocytes. PRAME is a good candidate for tumor immunotherapy and is a useful marker gene for detection of minimal residual disease (MRD). In this study, PRAME mRNA using real-time RT-PCR was studied in 74 adult cases with acute leukemia-68 had de-novo acute leukemia, 3 had chronic myeloid leukemia-blastic crisis (CML-BC), and 3 had myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative syndrome-blastic transformation (MDS/MPD-BT)-and the results were compared with 30 age-matched healthy volunteers. Nineteen of 74 cases with leukemia expressed PRAME, while only 2 controls showed weak expression. The prevalence of PRAME expression in AML and ALL cases was 30% and 17%, respectively. We did not find any important correlation between PRAME expression and clinical characteristics, such as age, sex, organomegaly/lymphadenopathy, Hb, WBC count, platelet count, LDH level, alkaline phosphatase, albumin, cell-surface antigens, response to therapy, or progression-free and overall survival. PRAME was monitored in 15 cases during remission and/or relapse. There was a good correlation between PRAME mRNA and hematological remission and/or relapse. Interestingly, PRAME was very high in one case with AML but was not found 3 months after allogeneic transplantation. PRAME mRNA is observed in about one-third of AML cases; it may be a useful marker to detect MRD, and it may also be a good predictor for the timing of donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI) in the post-transplant period in cases of molecular relapse.","['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (PRAME protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",,,"['Copyright (c) 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Autoantibody appearance was precipitated by the onset of graft-versus-host disease, was identical to that of the donor, and ultimately lead to cerebrovascular thrombosis, which was successfully treated with antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy.",['0 (Autoantibodies)'],,,"['Copyright (c) 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fifty-four bone marrow specimens from 21 patients diagnosed with de-novo AML were included. The level of hTERT mRNA was measured with the Telo TAGGG hTERT Quantification Kit (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany), using a LightCycler Instrument (Roche Diagnostics). The level of hTERT mRNA was determined as the relative ratio (RR), which was calculated by dividing the level of hTERT mRNA by the level of the porphobilinogen deaminase (PBGD) housekeeping gene in the same samples [1,000x(hTERT/PBGD)]. The expression rates of hTERT mRNA were significantly higher at diagnosis (73%) and during relapse (80%) than during remission (27%) (P<0.05). The median RR for diagnosis or relapse was significantly higher than that for patients in remission (P<0.05). hTERT mRNA expression was not correlated with CD34 expression, blast counts, white blood cell counts, or chromosomal abnormality (P>0.05). Two patients who showed hTERT mRNA expression during remission (RR 3.14 and 7.15, respectively) relapsed after 1 month. Among seven patients with high hTERT mRNA levels (RR>9.51), 4 failed to achieve complete remission (CR), whereas 4 of 5 patients without hTERT mRNA expression at diagnosis or during relapse achieved CR (P>0.05). Patients showing a trend of increasing hTERT mRNA levels failed to reach a second CR after relapse, while those with a trend toward decreasing hTERT mRNA did achieve CR. Among eight samples showing hTERT mRNA expression in remission (RR>0), 5 were obtained from patients who had received GCSF within 14 days. The expression rate and level of hTERT mRNA during remission were significantly higher in patients who had previously received GSCF (56%, RR=0.15) than in other patients (15%, RR=0) (P<0.05). Serial and quantitative analysis of hTERT mRNA may be a useful marker for prediction of prognosis and monitoring in AML patients.","['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)']",,,"['Copyright (c) 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2005 Nov 12.,"We describe a case of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) bearing the translocation t(11;17)(q23;q21). The morphological phenotype represented a monoblastic leukemia, AML French-American-British (FAB) M5a. Further analysis of the translocation revealed an involvement of the mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) gene and a region closely proximal to the retinoic acid (RA) receptor alpha (RARA) gene. AMLs involving both a rearranged MLL and the 17q21 region, in which the RARA gene is located, have only been described in some individual cases. The functional role of this translocation is still unknown. Rearrangements of the MLL (11q23) gene in AML are usually related to the morphological phenotype FAB M5. In general, they are associated with an adverse prognosis. In acute promyelocytic leukemia, the translocation (15;17)(q22;q11-21) involving the RARA leads to a maturation arrest that can be overcome by RA, often inducing remission. In other forms of AML, however, the effects of RA are limited and diverse. To study whether RA might have a therapeutical potential in our case, we performed an in vitro analysis of RA effects on AML cells. We found that RA leads to enhanced cell death and up-regulation of CD38 and CD117. However, no hints of RA-induced in vitro differentiation were visible. Our data indicate that in AML cells bearing the t(11;17)(q23;q21), a differentiation arrest that is overcome by RA is not present. On the contrary, RA induces alterations in cellular regulation that are similar to the RA-induced changes observed in early hematogenic progenitors; thus, a possible therapeutical benefit of RA in such cases remains open.","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",,20051112,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since an activation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB occurs during ATRA-induced maturation of APL cells, a mechanistic link between these two processes was investigated. Using an in vitro model for APL, we report that ectopic overexpression of a repressor of NF-kappaB activation did not affect granulocytic differentiation. Importantly, NF-kappaB inhibition markedly resulted in a decreased viability of the differentiated cells, which correlated with increased apoptosis. Apoptosis was accompanied by a sustained activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). Inhibition of JNK by the specific inhibitor SP600125 or by transfection of a dominant-negative mutant of JNK1 reduced the percentage of apoptotic cells, thus showing that JNK activation constitutes a death signal. Furthermore, impairment of NF-kappaB activation resulted in increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) upon ATRA treatment. ROS accumulation was suppressed by the antioxidant butylated hydroxyanisol, which also abolished ATRA-induced JNK activation and apoptosis. Altogether, our results demonstrate an anti-apoptotic effect of NF-kappaB activation during ATRA-induced differentiation of NB4 cells and identify repression of ROS-mediated JNK activation as a mechanism for this effect. Our observations also suggest that NF-kappaB signalling may contribute to an accumulation of mature APL cells and participate in the development of ATRA syndrome.","['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (CD11c Antigen)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '25013-16-5 (Butylated Hydroxyanisole)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",,,"['Oncogene (2005) 24, 7145-7155. doi:10.1038/sj.onc.1208889; published online 25', 'July 2005.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its product, Bcr-Abl protein, has been shown to activate signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3) and to promote self-renewal in embryonic stem (ES) cells, even in the absence of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). MEK kinase 1 (MEKK1) is a 196-kDa mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase kinase involved in Bcr-Abl signal transduction. To investigate the role of MEKK1 in Bcr-Abl-induced transformation of stem cells, p210 Bcr-Abl was stably transfected into wild-type (WT(p210)) and MEKK1-/- (MEKK1-/-(p210)) ES cells. Bcr-Abl enhanced MEKK1 expression in ES transfectants, as it does in other Bcr-Abl-transformed cells. In the absence of LIF, WT(p210) cells showed constitutive STAT3 activation and formed rounded, compact colonies having strong alkaline phosphatase activity, a characteristic phenotype of undifferentiated ES cells. MEKK1-/-(p210) cells, by contrast, showed less STAT3 activity than WT(p210) cells and formed large, flattened colonies having weak alkaline phosphatase activity, a phenotype of differentiated ES cells. These results indicate that MEKK1 plays a key role in Bcr-Abl-induced STAT3 activation and in ES cells' capacity for LIF-independent self-renewal, and may thus be involved in Bcr-Abl-mediated leukemogenesis in stem cells.","['0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (MAP Kinase Kinase Kinase 1)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using a bone marrow transplantation model, we demonstrate that TEL/AML1 expression impinges on normal hematopoietic differentiation, leading to the in vivo accumulation and persistence of an early progenitor compartment with a Sca1(+)/Kit(hi)/CD11b(+) phenotype and an increased self-renewal capacity, as documented by replating assays in vitro. Differentiation of these cells is not blocked, but the frequency of mature blood cells arising from TEL/AML1-transduced progenitors is low. Impaired differentiation is prominently observed in the pro-B-cell compartment, resulting in an proportional increase in early progenitors in vivo, consistent with the t(12;21) ALL phenotype. Despite the accumulation of both multipotent and B-cell progenitors in vivo, no leukemia induction was observed during an observation period of over 1 year. These results are consistent with findings in twins with concordant ALL, showing that TEL/AML1 generates a preleukemic clone in utero that persists for several years in a clinically covert fashion. Furthermore, our studies showed that the pointed domain of TEL/AML1, which recruits transcriptional repressors and directs oligomerization with either TEL/AML1 or wild-type TEL, was essential for the observed differentiation impairment and could not be replaced with another oligomerization domain.","['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (TEL-AML1 fusion protein)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Naturally occurring plasma IgM and IgG antibodies against these antigens are ubiquitous. Nonetheless, the ABO blood group system is widely ignored by many transfusion services, except for purposes of red cell transfusion. We implemented a policy of transfusing only ABO identical platelets and red cells in patients undergoing stem cell transplantation or treatment for hematologic malignancies. Major bleeding episodes have occurred in about 5% of patients undergoing induction therapy for acute leukemia as compared with 15-20% in the literature. Overall survival times appear to be superior to that in historical cohorts. In 2002-2004, treatment-related mortality at 100 days in our Blood and Marrow Transplant Unit was 0.7% for autologous transplants (n=148), 13% for sibling allogeneic transplants (n=110), and 24% (n=62) for matched unrelated allogeneic transplants, suggesting that our approach is safe. We speculate that more rigorous efforts on the part of transfusion services to provide ABO identical blood components, and to remove incompatible supernatant plasma, when necessary, might yield reduced morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing stem cell transplantation.",['0 (ABO Blood-Group System)'],67,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although pretransplant nonmyeloablative (NMA) or reduced-intensity conditioning regimens appear very promising, prospective studies comparing this approach with the conventional myeloablative (MA) approach in specific hematologic diseases are necessary, especially in patients in whom the conventional approach is not contraindicated. Cost may be an important factor in the decision-making process. We compared the costs of MA and NMA transplants in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We estimated 1-year resource utilization in 12 consecutive MA patients (median age: 39 years) and in 11 consecutive NMA patients (median age: 58 years) who underwent HLA-identical sibling SCT for AML. Resources care expenses were valued using the average daily rate for personnel costs, supplies, and room costs. Other data were directly collected from the patients' charts. Despite a trend for lower costs in NMA patients during the first 6 months, costs during the 6-12-month period were significantly higher after NMA due to late complications and readmissions (P=0.03). Finally, mean 1-year costs were not different in MA and NMA patients (P=0.75).

Epub 2005 Jul 25.,"PURPOSE: To determine the role of myeloablative conditioning and unrelated donor (URD) bone marrow transplantation in the treatment of patients with advanced B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 38 CLL patients received a matched URD transplant using bone marrow procured by the National Marrow Donor Program. The median age was 45 years (range, 26 to 57 years), the median time from diagnosis was 51 months, and the median number of prior chemotherapy regimens was three. Fifty-five percent of patients were chemotherapy refractory and 89% had received fludarabine. Conditioning included total-body irradiation in 92% of patients. Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis consisted of methotrexate with cyclosporine or tacrolimus for 82% of patients. RESULTS: Twenty-one patients (58%) achieved complete response and six (17%) achieved partial response. Incidences of grades 2 to 4 acute GVHD were 45% at 100 days and incidences of chronic GVHD were 85% at 5 years. Eleven patients are alive and disease free at a median of 6 years (range, 3.0 to 9.0 years). Five-year overall survival, failure-free survival, disease progression rates, and treatment-related mortality (TRM) were 33%, 30%, 32%, and 38% respectively. CONCLUSION: These data demonstrate that lasting remissions can be achieved after URD transplantation in patients with advanced CLL. High TRM suggest that myeloablative conditioning and HLA-mismatched donors should be avoided in future protocols, and it is mandatory to investigate transplant strategies with a lower morbidity and mortality, including the use of nonmyeloablative regimens.",,,20050725,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2005 Jul 25.,"Decitabine is a potent demethylating agent that exhibits clinical activity against myeloid malignancies. Numerous genes silenced by hypermethylation are reactivated by decitabine through a mechanism involving promoter demethylation with subsequent release of histone deacetylases (HDACs) and accumulation of acetylated histones. Recent studies indicating that decitabine also induces regional chromatin remodeling of some unmethylated genes suggest additional mechanisms of action. Decitabine reactivates unmethylated p21WAF1 in some AML cell lines but the possible occurrence of p21WAF1 methylation in AML in vivo has not been studied in detail and decitabine effects on p21WAF1 chromatin remodeling have not been reported. We found that p21WAF1 mRNA was undetectable in 6 of 24 AML patient samples and 4 of 5 AML cell lines but there was no evidence of p21WAF1 promoter methylation. However, decitabine induced p21WAF1 in AML cell lines KG-1 and KG-1a in association with release of HDAC1 and increased acetylated histone H3 at the unmethylated p21WAF1 promoter. Decitabine effects on p21WAF1 histone acetylation and induction were enhanced by the HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A and were independent of wild type p53. Our findings indicate that decitabine can relieve p21WAF1 repression in AML by a mechanism that involves release of HDAC1 without requiring promoter demethylation. Furthermore, our study provides evidence that combined decitabine and HDAC inhibitor treatment can enhance chromatin remodeling and reactivation of an unmethylated tumor suppressor gene.

The UVA irradiation of 2.5 microM tBuOPT inhibits strongly cell growth and cell viability, causes pronounced membrane damage, and induces micronuclei. Without irradiation, tBuOPT does not cause any cell damage at 2.5 microM concentration. The phototoxicity of tBuOPT is effectively inhibited by the radical scavenger glutathione, while the photogenotoxicity (micronuclei induction) is not affected by this strong hydrogen-atom donor. Thus, for the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity different reactive species seems to be responsible. The cytotoxicity is presumably caused by oxyl radicals, which are derived from tert-butoxyl radicals generated by photocleavage of tBuOPT, while in the genotoxicity the less reactive pyridyl-2-thiyl radicals appear to play a role. These results demonstrate that N-alkoxypyridinethiones are useful photochemical sources of oxyl and thiyl radicals to elucidate biological effects caused by these free radicals.","['0 (Free Radicals)', '0 (N-tert-butoxypyridine-2-thione)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (Thiones)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HTLV-1 encodes the transforming gene tax1, whose expression in an interleukin (IL)-2-dependent T-cell line (CTLL-2) induces IL-2-independent growth. RESULTS: In this study, we demonstrated that IL-2-independent growth induction by Tax1 was abrogated by mutations of the PDZ domain-binding motif (PBM) at the Tax1 C-terminus. HTLV-2 Tax2, which shares 75% amino acid identity with Tax1 but does not have a PBM, was not able to induce IL-2-independent growth of CTLL-2. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that Tax1, through interaction with PDZ domain protein(s) induces IL-2-independent growth, which may be a factor in multi-step leukemogenesis caused by HTLV-1.","['0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (NF-kappa B)']",,20050723,,,,PMC1199618,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The internal tandem duplication (ITD) of the juxtamembrane region of this receptor is the most prevalent mutation in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). The silencing mediator of retinoic and thyroid hormone receptors (SMRT) co-repressor recruits histone deacetylases (HDAC) and mediates transcriptional repression by interacting with various transcription factors. We recently reported that Flt3-ITD interferes with the transcriptional and biological action of promyelocytic leukaemia zinc finger transcriptional repressor by dissociating it from SMRT. In this study, we aimed to clarify whether the repressional activity of other well-known oncoproteins, such as AML1/Runx1 (AML1), is also affected by Flt3-ITD. We verified that the repression activity of AML1B, the isoform of AML1, is dependent on HDAC activity by using HDAC inbitor trichostatin A in GAL4 reporter assays. Mammalian two-hybrid assays demonstrated that this protein interacts with SMRT. Furthermore, this AML1B-SMRT interaction was disrupted by the overexpression of Flt3-ITD, leading to the reduction of AML1B repression activity. Additionally, we showed AML1B repression target, p21 (WAF1/CIP1), was aberrantly expressed in Flt3-ITD stably expressed BaF3 cells. Taken together, Flt3-ITD disrupts transcriptional repressor functions resulting in aberrant gene regulation in leukaemic cells.","['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (NCOR2 protein, human)', '0 (Ncor2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Nuclear Receptor Co-Repressor 2)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Runx1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Flt3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although responses to interferon-alpha (IFN) are slower and less dramatic than those to imatinib, they can be durable even after discontinuation of the drug. Unlike imatinib, the specific mechanisms responsible for IFN's clinical activity in CML are unknown. We found that IFN induced a G1 cell cycle arrest, as well as terminal differentiation, of the CML cell line KT-1 and CML CD34+ cells from clinical specimens. Myeloid growth factors augmented the antileukaemic activity of IFN, and neutralising antibodies directed against myeloid growth factors inhibited IFN's antileukaemic activity. We next directly compared the effects of imatinib and IFN against differentiated and primitive CML progenitors from newly-diagnosed patients. Although less active against CML granulocyte-macrophage colony forming units than imatinib, IFN was significantly more toxic to primitive CML progenitors responsible for the maintenance of long-term cultures. Imatinib and IFN appear to have divergent effects on CML progenitors at different stages of maturation, with imatinib more active against differentiated CML progenitors and IFN more active against primitive CML progenitors. The different target cells for these agents may explain the disparities in the kinetics and durability of their clinical responses.

The majority of individuals with MBL will have cells that are indistinguishable from chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). However, this blood cell clonal expansion of CD5+ or CD5- B-lymphocytes is age-dependent and immunophenotypic heterogeneity is common. Longitudinal studies are required to determine whether MBL is a precursor state to CLL or other B-lymphoproliferative disease in a situation analogous to a monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance and myeloma.

NO-ASA seems to overcome the low potency and toxicity of traditional ASA. The -ONO2 moiety is responsible for releasing NO, and it appears to be required for biological activity. In studies in vitro, NO-ASA inhibits the growth of colon, pancreatic, prostate, lung, skin, leukaemia and breast cancer cells, and is up to 6000-fold more potent than traditional ASA. This effect is owing to cell kinetics [inhibition of proliferation, induction of apoptosis (multiple criteria) and blocking the G1 to S cell-cycle transition] and cell signalling [inhibition of Wnt signalling (IC50=0.2 microM), inhibition of NF-kappaB (nuclear factor kappaB) activation (IC50=7.5 microM), inhibition of nitric oxide synthase-2 expression (IC50=48 microM), inhibition of MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) signalling (IC50=10 microM) and induction of cyclo-oxygenase-2 at approx. 10 microM]. In studies in vivo, NO-ASA inhibits intestinal carcinogenesis in Min mice (tumour multiplicity was reduced by 59% after 3 weeks, with no effect in control animals and no side effects) and in the N-nitrosobis(2-oxopropyl)amine model of pancreatic cancer, where there was an 89% reduction in NO-ASA (3000 p.p.m. in the diet)-treated animals (P<0.001). There was no statistically significant effect by traditional ASA at equimolar doses. Our data indicate that NO-ASA is a highly promising agent for the prevention and/or treatment of cancer.","['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal)', '0 (Anticarcinogenic Agents)', '0 (Nitric Oxide Donors)', 'R16CO5Y76E (Aspirin)']",15,,,,"['CA34527/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA92423/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In human cells they can be repaired mainly by non-homologous DNA end joining (NHEJ). The efficacy of NHEJ pathway was examined in normal human lymphocytes and K562 myeloid leukemic cells expressing the BCR/ABL oncogenic tyrosine kinase activity and lacking p53 tumor suppressor protein. In our studies we employed a simple and rapid in vitro DSB end joining assay based on fluorescent detection of repair products. Normal and cancer cells were able to repair DNA damage caused by restriction endonucleases, but the efficiency of the end joining was dependent on the type of cells and the structure of DNA ends. K562 cells displayed decreased NHEJ activity in comparison to normal cells for 5' complementary DNA overhang. For blunt-ended DNA there was no significant difference in end joining activity. Both kinds of cells were found about 10-fold more efficient for joining DNA substrates with compatible 5' overhangs than those with blunt ends. Our recent findings have shown that stimulation of DNA repair could be involved in the drug resistance of BCR/ABL-positive cells in anticancer therapy. For the first time the role of STI571 was investigated, a specific inhibitor of BCR/ABL oncogenic protein approved for leukemia treatment in the NHEJ pathway. Surprisingly, STI571 did not change the response of BCR/ABL-positive K562 cells in terms of NHEJ for both complementary and blunt ends. Our results suggest that the various responses of the cells to DNA damage via NHEJ can be correlated with the differences in the genetic constitution of human normal and cancer cells. However, the role of NHEJ in anticancer drug resistance in BCR/ABL-positive cells is questionable.","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHOD: We used the Medical Outcomes Study 36-item Short-Form (SF-36) to measure the HRQOL of 97 mothers of children (average age 6.2, range 0-14) with leukemia diagnosed between 1999 and 2000, and compared their scores to those of 240 mothers of children without leukemia matched to the children with leukemia. MAIN RESULTS: Of the eight unadjusted domain scores of the SF-36, five were significantly low among mothers of children with leukemia compared to mothers of children without leukemia: 'role-physical functioning' (RP), 'general health perception' (GH), 'vitality' (VT), 'social functioning' (SF) and 'mental health' (MH). Their SF-36 domain scores, when adjusted for demographic and clinical factors were also significantly low in RP, GH, VT, SF, RE and MH. The MH and SF scores in mothers of children with leukemia requiring hospital care were, respectively, approximately 20 points (1 standard deviation (SD), p < 0.0001) and 30 points (1.5 SD, p < 0.0001) lower than that of mothers of children without leukemia. CONCLUSION: Mothers of children with leukemia requiring hospital care have poor HRQOL, particularly with regard to mental health and social functioning, and are at a greater risk for depression. These results suggest that the current system for treating leukemic diseases of children in Japan should also include close monitoring of mothers' mental health, and provision of appropriate treatment and psycho-social support.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PROCEDURE: Nurses as proxy respondents used the Health Utilities Index 3 (HUI3) to assess the health-related quality of life (HRQL) in twenty-five patients (age 6 years or older) enrolled on a frontline protocol for leukemia. HRQL observations (n = 70) were made at three different time points to coincide with high-dose methotrexate therapy. Additionally, the proxy respondents evaluated the ease of use of the instrument and the data quality. RESULTS: As patients' health status declined, the number of unassessable HRQL items increased. These missing data made scoring cumbersome and precluded calculation of the overall HRQL scores for nearly 50% of the patients. CONCLUSIONS: Use of the provider proxy-assessed HUI3 in pediatric cancer trials may result in a high proportion of missing data. Trials may benefit more from the use of HRQL measures that consider the acuity of the child's illness, domains specific and sensitive to both disease and treatment, and items that can be proxy-assessed independent of input from parent or patient. Evaluations that combine child self-reports with both parent and provider reports may ultimately provide the most reliable and comprehensive perspective on children's quality of life.",,,,,['Qual Life Res. 2006 Sep;15(7):1291-3; discussion 1295-6.

Proteomics offers great promise for the study of proteins in plasma/serum, indeed a number of proteomics databases for plasma/serum have been established. This is a very complex body fluid containing lipids, carbohydrates, amino acids, vitamins, nucleic acids, hormones, and proteins. About 1500 different proteins have recently been identified, and a number of potential new markers of diseases have been characterized. Here, examples of the enormous promise of plasma/serum proteomic analysis for diagnostic/prognostic markers and information on disease mechanism are given.

Epub 2005 Jul 22.,"GOALS OF WORK: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of the intensive dental care protocol in preventing oral complications in acute leukemia patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-four patients hospitalized for induction remission therapy for acute leukemia were randomly assigned to one of two groups, whether to receive intensive dental care protocol or not. The intensive dental care group of patients received dental treatment and plaque and calculus removal prior to chemotherapy and supervised oral hygiene measures during chemotherapy. The limited dental care group of patients did not receive prechemotherapy dental care. Groups were comparable in age, sex, and antineoplastic treatment received. Patients were examined after admission to the hospital; at the initiation of the chemotherapy; and 7, 14, 21, and 28 days after initiation of therapy. Positive data about subjective difficulties were taken by anamnesis. Oral hygiene index (OHI) and gingival index (GI) were used to assess the periodontal status of the patients. The severity of mucositis was evaluated according to WHO classification. MAIN RESULTS: The results of this study pointed out lower mean values of GI and lower mean values of mucositis score in the intensive dental care group of patients during the whole period of examination. Although the differences in mean values were not statistically significant on most of the examination days, intensive dental care group of patients developed less severe and less painful oral complications compared to the limited dental care group of patients. CONCLUSION: We conclude that proper dental care and preventive measures both before and during chemotherapy can be beneficial to these patients.",['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],,20050722,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Owing to nonrandom gains of chromosomes, trisomies are present in many cases of leukemia and other malignances. We used polymorphisms in the genes encoding thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT), gamma-glutamyl hydrolase (GGH) and the reduced folate carrier (SLC19A1) to assess the nature of chromosomal acquisition and its influence on genotype-phenotype concordance in cancer cells. TPMT and GGH activities in somatic cells were concordant with germline genotypes, whereas activities in leukemia cells were determined by chromosomal number and whether the acquired chromosomes contained a wild-type or variant allele. Leukemia cells that had acquired an additional chromosome containing a wild-type TPMT or GGH allele had significantly lower accumulation of thioguanine nucleotides or methotrexate polyglutamates, respectively. Among these genes, there was a comparable number of acquired chromosomes with wild-type and variant alleles. Therefore, chromosomal gain can alter the concordance of germline genotype and cancer cell phenotypes, indicating that allele-specific quantitative genotyping may be required to define cancer pharmacogenomics unequivocally.","['0 (Membrane Transport Proteins)', '0 (Reduced Folate Carrier Protein)', '0 (SLC19A1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.67 (thiopurine methyltransferase)', 'EC 3.4.19.9 (gamma-Glutamyl Hydrolase)']",,20050724,,['Nat Genet. 2005 Aug;37(8):794-5.

Caspase-8, -9, and -3 cleavage and functional activities began 4 h after toxin exposure and peaked after 8 h of treatment. Caspase-6 may also contribute to Stx1-induced apoptosis by directly acting on caspase-8.

Recently developed culture conditions and treatment strategies may bring us closer to the selective elimination of such alloreactive T cells, often considered the holy grail of transplantation. Among the various therapeutic modalities, photodynamic therapy (PDT) offers a biological and global approach to the eradication of unwanted allo-activated T cells by combining mitochondrial targeting, P-glycoprotein inhibition and reactive oxygen species production. Indeed, the high potency of PDT against malignant cells has been harnessed to exert selective and extensive elimination of alloreactive T-cell subsets mediating GvHD, while preserving resting T cells with the ability to reconstitute the immune system for GvL activity and prevent or suppress viruses and fungi. The present paper reviews the basis of the PDT strategy, and the methodology employed. In vitro and in vivo studies that formed the proof of principle as a basis for human studies to investigate the clinical potential of PDT in the context of GvHD will be presented together with insights into future clinical applications of this versatile treatment platform.",['0 (Photosensitizing Agents)'],39,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These findings demonstrate the vital role of donor T cells in providing graft-versus-tumor (GvT) and anti-pathogen effects as well as facilitating immune reconstitution.

However, the 3T3-CD40L cell line, regularly used for engagement of CD40 on the B-cell surface, is a potential source of xenoantigens. This may affect the specificity of T cells stimulated with CD40-activated B cells, especially when generation of T-cell lines specific for endogenously processed Ag is desired. METHODS: To develop a system that allows efficient expansion of B cells in the absence of sources of xenoantigens, we created a human 293-CD40L-sCD40L cell line that produces soluble CD40L and expresses CD40L on the cell surface. B cells from patients with hematologic malignancies were expanded on the 293-CD40L-sCD40L cells and used for stimulation of either naive or in vivo primed donor T cells in three HLA-identical patient-donor combinations. RESULTS: The 293-CD40L-sCD40L cell line was able to stimulate B-cell growth with an efficiency superior to that of the commonly used 3T3-CD40L cell line. In all cases T-cell lines and, subsequently, T-cell clones were generated that showed reactivity against patient and not donor B cells, suggesting their specificity for minor histocompatibility antigens (mHAg). DISCUSSION: B cells activated with GMP grade 293-CD40L-sCD40L can be used in a variety of applications. In particular, they may be suitable for ex vivo stimulation of T cells prior to donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI), which may enhance its graft versus leukemia (GvL) effect.","['0 (Antigens, Heterophile)', '0 (CD40 Antigens)', '0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (Minor Histocompatibility Antigens)', '147205-72-9 (CD40 Ligand)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2005 Jan 11.,"Epidemiological studies of occupational exposure to formaldehyde gas (HCHO) have suggested possible links between concentration and duration of exposure, and elevated risks of leukaemia and other cancers at sites distant from the site of contact. Formaldehyde is a highly water soluble gas which, when inhaled, reacts rapidly at the site of contact and is quickly metabolised by enzymes in the respiratory tissue. Inhaled formaldehyde is almost entirely absorbed in the respiratory tract and, for formaldehyde induced toxicity to occur at distant sites, HCHO must enter the blood and be transported to systemic tissues via the circulatory system. A mathematical model describing the absorption and removal of inhaled formaldehyde in the nasal tissue is therefore formulated to predict the proportion of formaldehyde entering into the blood. Accounting for the spatial distribution of the formaldehyde concentration and the metabolic activity within the mucosa, the concentration of formaldehyde in the mucus, the epithelium and the blood has been determined and was found to attain a steady-state profile within a few seconds of exposure. The increase of the formaldehyde concentration in the blood was predicted to be insignificant compared with the existing pre-exposure levels in the body, indicating that formaldehyde is rapidly removed in the nasal tissue. The results of the model thus suggest that it is highly unlikely that following inhalation by the nose, formaldehyde itself will cause toxicity at sites other than the initial site of contact in the respiratory tract.","['0 (Environmental Pollutants)', '1HG84L3525 (Formaldehyde)']",,20050111,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of the present study was the detailed evaluation of T lymphocyte subsets in peripheral blood in children after treatment of ALL. All children were treated according to the BFM 90 protocol. The patients were divided into 5 groups of 30 children in each, depending on the time from cessation of the ALL treatment. A control group consisted of 30 healthy children subjected to elective ""1-day"" surgery. The children's age ranged from 6 to 18 years. The examinations were performed in FACScan flow cytometer with the use of wide set of monoclonal antibodies: CD3, CD4, CD8, TCRalphabeta, TCRgammadelta, CD19, CD25, CD45RA, CD45RO, CD69, HLA-DR, CD16 and CD56, which particularly allowed detailed analysis of T lymphocytes. The results showed that most parameters in children 1 year after ALL treatment completion were similar to healthy children. However, we observed persistently low CD4+ T cell numbers, both CD45RA+ as well as CD45RO+ subsets as compared to the control group.

The hazards associated with exposure to ionising radiation have been recognised for nearly a century, but interest was aroused when a cluster of leukaemia cases was identified in young children living in Seascale, close to the nuclear processing plant at Sellafield in West Cumbria. There was a civil court case on behalf of two of the alleged victims of paternal irradiation at Seascale against British Nuclear Fuels. The case foundered on ""the balance of probabilities"". Nevertheless, there was support for paternal exposure from Japanese experimental X-ray studies in mice. The tumours were clearly heritable as shown by F2 transmission. Also, effects of a relatively non-toxic dose of radiation (1Gy) on cell proliferation transmitted to the embryo were manifested in the germ line of adult male mice even after two generations. In addition in humans, smoking fathers appear to give rise to tumours in the F(1) generation. Using rodent models, developmental abnormalities/congenital malformations and tumours can be studied after exposure of males in an extended dominant lethal assay and congenital malformations can be determined which have similar manifestations in humans. The foetuses can also be investigated for skeletal malformations and litters can be allowed to develop to adulthood when tumours, if present, can be observed. Karyotype analysis can be performed on foetuses and adult offspring to determine if induced genetic damage can be transmitted. Using this study design, cyclophosphamide, 1,3-butadiene and urethane have been examined and each compound produced positive responses: cyclophosphamide in all endpoints examined, 1,3-butadiene in some and urethane only produced liver tumours in F(1) male offspring. This suggests the endpoints are determined by independent genetic events. The results from heritable studies with 1,3-butadiene have been used in the parallelogram approach to determine a risk assessment for the germ cells in man.",['0 (Teratogens)'],80,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients included were those with small lymphocytic lymphoma/chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (n=23), marginal zone lymphoma, nodal type (n=18), mantle cell lymphoma (n=17), and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (n=13). Bulky disease (5 cm) was present in 73% of all patients. A median of two prior chemotherapy regimens (range 0-10) preceded LD-IF-RT. Median time since diagnosis was 31 months (range 1-216 months). Time to (local) progression was calculated according to the Kaplan-Meier method. Differences in response rates were compared using the chi2-test. The results showed that overall response rate was 87%; complete remission (CR) was reached in 34 patients (48%) and a partial remission (PR) in 28 patients (39%). Stable disease (SD) was maintained in nine patients (13%). The median time to progression (TP) was 12 months and the median time to local progression (TLP) was 22 months. The 34 CR patients showed a median TP of 16 months and a median TLP of 23 months. None of the factors studied (age, sex, lymphoma subtype, radiotherapy regimen, number of prior regimens or time since diagnosis, number of positive sites or largest lymphoma diameter) were found to relate to response. At time of death 70% of patients were without in-field progression after LD-IF-RT.

With the purpose of identifying genes that could be related to disease progression, we have performed gene expression profiling on B-CLL patients with an indolent disease and patients with a progressive disease with need for therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: we applied the Affymetrix GeneChip technique to 11 B-CLL patients with stable and 10 patients with clinically progressive disease. Supervised and unsupervised clustering methods with different algorithms were used to identify genes that tend to give a distinction between stable and progressive disease. RESULTS: The supervised learning procedures identified groups of genes with a combined power to discriminate samples from progressive and stable disease with 70-90% accuracy. The gene for protein phosphatase 2 regulatory subunit B' (B56) gamma isoform (PPP2R5C) and the gene for retinoblastoma-like 2 (p130) (RBL2) were included among the best discriminators; both genes were downregulated in progressive as compared to stable B-CLL. In a hierarchical clustering analysis based on gene expression pattern three clinical subcategories could be identified: one with a more severe clinical outcome, a second one with good prognosis, and a third one that was intermediate between the other two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our application of microarray analysis on a clinically well defined material has identified a number of genes with combined expression patterns related to stable or progressive disease in general. Unsupervised clustering suggested the existence of subclasses of samples in the progressive group that may be identifiable through gene expression patterns.","['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (RBL2 protein, human)', '0 (Retinoblastoma-Like Protein p130)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (PPP2R5C protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Phosphoprotein Phosphatases)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Protein Phosphatase 2)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We demonstrated, using detection of IGH/TCR rearrangements and TEL/AML1 breakpoints sequencing that the cells were clonally related. Moreover, interphasic FISH using TEL and AML1 probes showed the loss of a second TEL at the time of relapse. This observation confirms that TEL/AML1 alone is not sufficient to trigger ALL and that TEL deletion is a secondary event in leukemogenesis.

A fraction of the activated whole cell currents was inhibited by 500 microM 4,4-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2-disulfonic acid (DIDS) and subsequent addition of 500 microM diphenylamine-2-carboxylate (DPC plus DIDS) further inhibited the remaining currents. The levels of forskolin-activated currents and subsequent blockade were similar in both cell lines. The effect of forskolin was prevented in cells previously exposed to 500 microM DPC. The effects of DIDS and DPC on the forskolin-activated whole cell currents support the idea that both CFTR and ORCC are generating a significant fraction of these currents with DIDS inhibiting ORCC currents and DPC inhibiting CFTR currents when the blockers are added one after another to the extracellular side. Finally, we show that exposure of K562 cells to vincristine which results in the over expression of MDR1 is not accompanied by a significant down regulation of CFTR as in other cells.","['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (CFTR protein, human)', '0 (Ion Channels)', '126880-72-6 (Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",,20050419,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2005 Apr 12.,"We have determined that CLL B cells consistently express type 3 membrane receptors for the Th2-derived cytokine IL-4 (IL-4R). Furthermore, when added to CLL B cells, IL-4 induces increased apoptosis resistance, increased protein synthesis in CLL B cells and rapid onset activation of STAT1, STAT5 and STAT6. Since the IL-4-IL-4R pathway is intact in CLL B cells and is related to apoptosis resistance, we considered whether we could target this pathway. A recombinant IL-4 Pseudomonas exotoxin fusion protein (IL-4 PE), known to bind to IL-4R, was incubated with CLL B cells. IL-4 PE (10 ng/ml) cultured with CLL B cells resulted in an increase of apoptosis/death from mean levels of 46.6+/-7.0 of non-exposed cells to 69+/-8.6 (n=6). By measuring in vitro protein synthesis, two predominant patterns of sensitivity were observed. In one, CLL B cell clones (n=4) were found to be extremely sensitive to IL-4 PE (IC50's range=6-25 ng/ml). In the second, low concentrations of IL-4 PE induced agonist activity while increasing concentrations induced cytotoxicity in 6 of 21 patient-derived cells. These studies suggest that the IL-4R, on B-CLL cells, can serve as a unique molecular target for directing cytotoxic agents in the therapy of B-CLL.","['0 (Bacterial Toxins)', '0 (Exotoxins)', '0 (Protein Synthesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-4)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (interleukin-4-Pseudomonas exotoxin)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)']",,20050412,,,['CA91542/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We review the current status of the role of Hsp expression in cancer with special emphasis on the clinical setting. Although Hsp levels are not informative at the diagnostic level, they are useful biomarkers for carcinogenesis in some tissues and signal the degree of differentiation and the aggressiveness of some cancers. In addition, the circulating levels of Hsp and anti-Hsp antibodies in cancer patients may be useful in tumor diagnosis. Furthermore, several Hsp are implicated with the prognosis of specific cancers, most notably Hsp27, whose expression is associated with poor prognosis in gastric, liver, and prostate carcinoma, and osteosarcomas, and Hsp70, which is correlated with poor prognosis in breast, endometrial, uterine cervical, and bladder carcinomas. Increased Hsp expression may also predict the response to some anticancer treatments. For example, Hsp27 and Hsp70 are implicated in resistance to chemotherapy in breast cancer, Hsp27 predicts a poor response to chemotherapy in leukemia patients, whereas Hsp70 expression predicts a better response to chemotherapy in osteosarcomas. Implication of Hsp in tumor progression and response to therapy has led to its successful targeting in therapy by 2 main strategies, including: (1) pharmacological modification of Hsp expression or molecular chaperone activity and (2) use of Hsps in anticancer vaccines, exploiting their ability to act as immunological adjuvants. In conclusion, the present times are of importance for the field of Hsps in cancer, with great contributions to both basic and clinical cancer research.","['0 (Adjuvants, Immunologic)', '0 (Heat-Shock Proteins)']",231,,,['Cell Stress Chaperones. 2005 Winter;10(4):263-4.

The use of multi-grounded neutrals in electrical distribution and residential electrical wiring systems in the United States results in a voltage on a residence's water line relative to earth that in turn creates a voltage between the water fixtures of a bathtub, sink, or shower and the drain, if the latter is made of conductive material. A bathing child may thus be exposed to contact current upon manual contact with the faucet, spout, or water stream. Dosimetry modeling indicates that modest and realistically anticipated currents (10s of microA) can produce electric fields in bone marrow (100s of mV/m) sufficient to overcome questions of biophysical plausibility. Both measurements in two regions of the United States and computer modeling of typical single-residence US neighborhoods indicate that residences with average magnetic fields in the high tail of the magnetic field distribution are more likely than residences with lower fields to also have higher contact voltage. The association of residential magnetic fields with contact voltage, the dosimetry results, and the indication from a behavioral survey that children tend to engage in behavior that results in exposure all support the hypothesis. Further research is needed to characterize electrical systems in other nations to determine whether contact current exposure occurs and whether it is associated with residential magnetic fields.",,24,,"['Copyright 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Between August 1994 and February 2003, 23 consecutive children with leukemia or myelodysplasia underwent matched-unrelated-donor bone marrow transplantation (BMT). The preparative regimen consisted of fractionated total body irradiation and cyclophosphamide in 6 patients; busulfan in combination with etoposide and cyclophosphamide in 4 patients who received cranial irradiation before transplantation; and busulfan and cyclophosphamide in 13 patients. RESULTS: Engraftment was achieved in 91.3% of cases. Acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) occurred in 18 of 21 patients who engrafted (85.7%). Event-free survival for all patients was 24.46 +/- 9.24%. The 12 children with standard-risk disease had better event-free survival than the 11 children with high-risk disease (46.88 +/- 15.03% vs 0%, p < or = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The major obstacles to successful matched-unrelated-donor BMT are acute GVHD, relapse and infection. Early transplantation and patient selection, prophylactic and therapeutic maneuvers for GVHD, as well as appropriate donor selection and virus prophylaxis may improve the results.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Granulocytic sarcomas are well known in patients with systemic leukemia and can sometimes precede a systemic leukemic outcome. A solitary granulocytic sarcoma not followed by a hematological proliferation of the myelocytic stem cells is very rare. No prognostic factors that are able to predict a systemic outcome are known. Therefore, in this case with no signs of systemic disease, we adopted a wait-and-see policy after radical orchidectomy.

The mutation was frequent in polycythemia vera (PV) (86%) and myelofibrosis (95%) but less prevalent in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with an antecedent PV or myelofibrosis (5 [36%] of 14 patients). JAK2 mutation was also detected in 3 (19%) of 16 patients with Philadelphia-chromosome (Ph)-negative chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), 2 (18%) of 11 patients with megakaryocytic AML, 7 (13%) of 52 patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, and 1 (1%) of 68 patients with myelodysplastic syndromes. No mutation was found in Ph(+)CML (99 patients), AML M0-M6 (28 patients), or acute lymphoblastic leukemia (20 patients).

Microsporidia can be highly pathogenic, causing a broad range of symptoms in humans, especially individuals who are immunocompromised. The vast majority of human cases of microsporidiosis have been reported during the past 20 years, in patients with HIV/AIDS, while only relatively rare cases have been described in immunocompetent individuals. However, microsporidia infections are being increasingly reported in patients following solid-organ transplanation, where the main symptom has been diarrhea. The authors report the first case of pulmonary microsporidial infection in an allogeneic bone marrow transplant recipient in the United States and only the second case in the world. The patient, with a history of Hodgkin disease followed by acute myelogenous leukemia received a T-cell-depleted graft, but succumbed to respiratory failure 63 days post transplantation. An open lung biopsy, taken just before death, was originally thought to show toxoplasmosis. The correct diagnosis of microsporidiosis was made postmortem by light and electron microscopy. DNA polymerase chain reaction analysis confirmed the diagnosis and furthermore revealed it to be the dog strain of the microsporidia species Encephalitozoon cuniculi. Although to date rarely diagnosed, microsporidial infection should also be considered in the differential diagnosis of, e.g., unexplained pulmonary infection in bone marrow transplant patients.","['0 (DNA, Protozoan)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Female Harlan SD rats served as the test animals for a special series of 2-year studies. Male rats were not used in these studies. Complete histopathology was performed on all animals, and the pathology results underwent comprehensive NTP pathology peer review. The most commonly observed neoplasms in these female control Harlan SD rats were mammary gland fibroadenoma (71%), tumors of the pars distalis of the pituitary (41%) and thyroid gland C-cell tumors (30%). Female Fischer rats had incidences of 44% for mammary gland fibroadenomas, 34% for tumors of the pars distalis, and 16% for thyroid gland C-cell tumors. Fischer rats had a 15% incidence of clitoral gland tumors, while the Harlan SD rats had an incidence of < 1%. In contrast to Fischer F344 rats, the Harlan SD rats had a high incidence of squamous metaplasia of the uterus (44.2%).

Here the authors present an HTLV-I--positive family of whom four members developed a chronic demyelinating polyneuropathy without HAM. Four female patients in a family from Hokkaido in Japan developed distal dominant paresthesia and muscle weakness in the second and third decades of their life. Neurological findings at ages ranging from 50 to 65 years included mild painful sensorimotor disturbances with atrophy of the distal parts of the extremities but without pyramidal signs or hyperactive tendon reflexes. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings of brain and spinal cord were unremarkable. Serum HTLV-I antibody levels were elevated at 1:8192 to 1:32,768, whereas those in cerebrospinal fluid were low at 1:4 to 1:8. Electrophysiological studies revealed polyphasic compound muscle action potentials with denervation potentials on nerve conduction studies and neurogenic patterns by electromyography, which were consistent with signs of chronic motor dominant demyelinating polyneuropathy. Sural nerve biopsy showed decreased myelinated fibers, occurrence of globule formation, myelin ovoid and remyelinated fibers, and an infiltration of CD68-positive macrophages with occasional CD4-positive T cells in the nerve fascicles. The polyneuropathy was responsive to steroid therapy. Analyses of serological human leukocyte antigen (HLA) types indicated that none of the patients possessed a high-risk HLA type known to be associated with adult T-cell leukemia (ATL), whereas they did have high responsive alleles to HTLV-I env similar to that observed in HAM. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the HTLV-I tax region demonstrated the B subgroup in all patients. This study suggests that HTLV-I infection can result in the development of a familial form of polyneuropathy that is associated with distinct HLA class I alleles, which might possibly involve a distinct virus subtype.","['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study the authors show increased expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in the brainstem tissues of ts1-infected mice. Up-regulated central nervous system (CNS) levels of this enzyme are associated with HIV-associated dementia and other inflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease. In brainstem sections, the authors find that astrocytes surrounding spongiform lesions contain increased amounts of immunoreactive COX-2. COX-2 is also up-regulated in cultured ts1-infected cells from the C1 astrocytic cell line, and activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase, or JNK, pathway. Markers of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, specifically the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (CHOP), the glucose-related protein 78 (GRP78), and phosphorylated eukaryotic initiation factor 2 alpha (eIF2 alpha), were also up-regulated in ts1-infected C1 astrocytes. Up-regulation of COX-2 and the above ER signaling factors was reversed by treatment of the infected cells with curcumin which specifically inhibits the JNK/c-Jun pathway. These findings indicate that the JNK/c-Jun pathway is most likely responsible for COX-2 expression induced by ts1 in astrocytes, and that ts1 infection in astrocytes may lead to up-regulation of both inflammatory and ER stress pathways in the central nervous system. Because COX-2 inhibitors are now widely used to treat inflammatory conditions in animals and humans, this finding suggests that these drugs may be useful for therapeutic intervention in neurodegenerative syndromes as well.","['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Ddit3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Endoplasmic Reticulum Chaperone BiP)', '0 (HSPA5 protein, human)', '0 (Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Hspa5 protein, mouse)', '0 (Molecular Chaperones)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '147336-12-7 (Transcription Factor CHOP)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (Cyclooxygenase 2)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (eIF-2 Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",,,,,"['CA16672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'ES07784/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'MH71583/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'NS43984/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tax is a potent oncogene that deregulates cellular gene expression by persistently activating signaling pathways such as NF-kappaB. Tax activation of NF-kappaB is critical for the immortalization and survival of HTLV-I-infected T cells. In this review, we describe recent insights into the mechanisms employed by Tax to activate the canonical and noncanonical NF-kappaB signaling pathways.

The rationale is that the reduction of quinone by ascorbate should be dependent of the quinone half-redox potential thus determining if reactive oxygen species (ROS) are formed or not, leading ultimately to cell death or cell survival. Among different ROS that may be formed during redox cycling between ascorbate and the quinone, the use of different antioxidant compounds (mannitol, desferal, N-acetylcysteine, catalase and superoxide dismutase) led to support H2O2 as the main oxidizing agent. We observed that standard redox potentials, oxygen uptake, free ascorbyl radical formation and cell survival were linked. The oxidative stress induced by the mixture of ascorbate and the different quinones decreases cellular contents of ATP and GSH while caspase-3-like activity remains unchanged. Again, we observed that quinones having higher values of half-redox potential provoke a severe depletion of ATP and GSH when they were associated with ascorbate. Such a drop in ATP content may explain the lack of activation of caspase-3. In conclusion, our results indicate that the cytotoxicity of the association quinone/ascorbate on K562 cancer cells may be predicted on the basis of half-redox potentials of quinones.","['0 (Free Radicals)', '0 (Quinones)', '723JX6CXY5 (Vitamin K 3)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'PQ6CK8PD0R (Ascorbic Acid)', 'S88TT14065 (Oxygen)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We previously demonstrated that LIF stimulation caused phosphorylation of gp130 at Ser782, adjacent to a dileucine internalization motif, and that transient expression of a mutant receptor lacking Ser782 resulted in increased cell surface expression and increased LIF-stimulated gene expression compared to wild-type receptor. Phosphorylation of Ser782 on gp130 fusion protein by LIF-stimulated 3T3-L1 cell extracts was inhibited 61% by autocamtide-2-related inhibitory peptide (AIP), a highly specific and highly effective inhibitor of calmodulin-dependent protein kinase type II (CaMKII). Purified rat forebrain CaMKII was also able to phosphorylate gp130 fusion protein at Ser782 in vitro. Furthermore, antibodies targeting CaMKII and CaMKIV were able to immunoprecipitate gp130 phosphorylating activity from LIF-stimulated 3T3-L1 lysates. While pretreatment of cells with the MAPKK inhibitors PD98059 and U0126 blocked phosphorylation of Ser782 prior to LIF stimulation, these inhibitors did not block Ser782 phosphorylation by LIF-stimulated 3T3-L1 cell extracts in vitro.

It is commonly assumed that to prevent relapse the level of minimal residual disease (MRD) should be as low as possible. To evaluate MRD, highly sensitive quantitative assays are needed. AIM: The aim of the study was to develop a robust and sensitive method for detection of the clonal immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable (IgV(H)) rearrangement in CLL and to introduce a highly sensitive and specific methodology for MRD monitoring in patients with CLL who undergo intensive treatment. METHODS: As a prerequisite for MRD detection, touch-down reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR using degenerate primers were used for the diagnostic identification of (H) gene rearrangement(s). For quantitative MRD detection in 18 patients, we employed a real-time RT-PCR assay (RQ-PCR) making use of patient-specific primers and the cost-saving Sybr-Green reporter dye (SG). For precise calibration of RQ-PCR, patient-specific IgV(H) sequences were cloned. RESULTS: Touch-down RT-PCR with degenerate primers allowed the successful detection of IgV(H) clonal rearrangement(s) in 252 of 257 (98.1%) diagnostic samples. Biallelic rearrangements were found in 27 of 252 (10.7%) cases. Degenerate primers used for the identification of clonal expansion at diagnosis were not sensitive enough for MRD detection. In contrast, our RQ-PCR assay using patient-specific primers and SG reached the sensitivity of 10(-)(6). We demonstrated MRD in each patient tested, including four of four patients in complete remission following autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and three of three following allogeneic 'mini'-HSCT. Increments in MRD might herald relapse; aggressive chemotherapy could induce molecular remission. CONCLUSIONS: Our touch-down RT-PCR has higher efficiency to detect clonal IgV(H) rearrangements including the biallelic ones. MRD quantitation of IgV(H) expression using SG-based RQ-PCR represents a highly specific, sensitive, and economic alternative to the current quantitative methods.","['0 (Benzothiazoles)', '0 (Diamines)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Organic Chemicals)', '0 (Quinolines)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '163795-75-3 (SYBR Green I)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Approximately fifty percent of all patients are familial cases and the remaining half consists of sporadic cases with no affected parent. The hallmark clinical features present in over 90% of all patients are cafe-au-lait spots and neurofibromas. However, the disorder should not be underestimated as a ""mere cosmetic problem"", since NF1 patients are at increased risk to also develop malignant tumours, such as malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumours (MPNST), juvenile myelomonocytic leukaemia (JMML), optic glioma and pheochomocytoma. Renovascular disease represents an additional risk factor for NF1 patients. The NF1 gene is a classic example for a tumour suppressor gene. It functions as a negative regulator of the protooncogene Ras. This function explains well its involvement in tumour formation. During the last 15 years, since the cloning of the gene, enormous progress has been made towards a better understanding of the natural history of the disorder. However, it cannot be said if and when a cure of the disorder will be possible. Great advantages have been achieved in the monitoring and management of several NF1 complications, for instance in the treatment of tibia pseudarthrosis and optic gliomas. Owing to the technical improvements of the approaches applied to identify NF1-mutations molecular-genetic testing with high mutation detection rates may help nowadays in patients in which the clinical diagnosis may not readily be established, such as in young children or atypical cases. A greater awareness of the complications and the different expression forms of NF1 and NF2 on the part of all types of physicians will further help to offer all patients adequate and timely counselling and treatment. The establishment of multi-disciplinary counselling and treatment centres for neurofibromatosis could be an important step towards a better management of NF1 and NF2 patients.","['0 (Neurofibromin 1)', '0 (Neurofibromin 2)']",,,,,,,,Neurofibromatose: die haufigste Tumor-disponierende genetische Erkrankung.,,,,,,,,,,,,

PROCEDURE: Milk samples from 27 cows known to have enzootic bovine leucosis (EBL) were serially diluted with milk from a herd known to be free from the disease. The dilution at which antibodies could no longer be detected by each test was determined. A total of 1959 bulk-milk samples submitted to a laboratory for the Victorian (EBL) eradication program were tested with both the Svanovir and the Lactelisa assays. A Bayesian approach was used to calculate maximum-likelihood estimates of test sensitivity and specificity. An additional 660 bulk-milk samples were tested with both the Svanovir and the Lactelisa assays. Herds that had positive results on either or both of the assays were subjected to blood or milk testing of individual cattle. RESULTS: The dilution of milk at which the Svanovir assay failed to detect enzootic bovine leucosis antibody in half of the samples was 1 in 40, whereas the comparable value for the Lactelisa was 1 in 200. Computer modeling of the operating characteristics of the Svanovir assay indicated that the sensitivity of that assay would be considerably lower than that for the Lactelisa, and the specificity was estimated to be higher. Evaluation of the assays using 660 bulk-milk samples showed that the Lactelisa assay detected four infected herds that were not detected by the Svanovir test. No false positive results were recorded for either assay. CONCLUSION: Use of the Lactelisa assay in the Victorian EBL eradication program will enhance disease detection and eradication, but may also result in an increased frequency of false positive bulk-milk test results.","['0 (Antibodies, Viral)']",,,,['Aust Vet J. 2005 Dec;83(12):767; author reply 767.

Its influences on outcomes of childhood cancer are unknown. A recent Children's Oncology Group symposium considered epidemiology of obesity, pharmacology of chemotherapy and outcomes in obese adults with cancer, excess mortality in obese pediatric patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and complications in obese survivors. The salient points are summarized herein. Body mass index (BMI) is the accepted index of weight for height and age. In the US, obesity prevalence (BMI > 95th centile) is increasing in all pediatric age groups and accelerating fastest among black and Hispanic adolescents. Pharmacologic investigations are few and limited: half-life, volume of distribution, and clearance in obese patients vary between drugs. Obese adults with solid tumors generally experience less toxicity, suggesting underdosing. For patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation, obese adults generally experience greater toxicity. In pediatric acute myeloblastic leukemia, obese patients have greater treatment-related mortality (TRM), similar toxicity and relapse rates, and inferior survival compared with patients who are not obese. An excess of female survivors of childhood leukemia who received cranial irradiation are obese. Ongoing treatment effects of childhood cancer may predispose to a sedentary lifestyle. These findings call for measures to prevent obesity, retrospective and prospective studies of chemotherapy pharmacology of analyzed according to BMI and outcomes, additional studies of the obesity impact on outcomes in pediatric cancer, and promotion of a healthy lifestyle among survivors.",,81,,"['2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,['R01 CA 100474-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has been suggested that cranial irradiation may play a role in the development of this complication. In order to explore that possibility, we examined survivors of brain tumors treated with and without radiation in childhood to investigate associations between radiation, osteopenia, physical activity, health status and overall health-related quality of life (HRQL). PROCEDURE: Subjects were survivors of posterior fossa tumors (astrocytoma or medulloblastoma) or optic glioma, < 18 years of age at diagnosis and > 1 year off treatment. Measurements of growth velocity, body composition, bone densitometry, physical activity and HRQL were undertaken. RESULTS: Twenty-five (62.5%) of the 40 eligible patients participated in the study. Of the 25 patients, 12 (48%) received radiation therapy (R group) while 13 received no radiation (NR group). Growth hormone (GH) deficiency had been detected in three subjects, one had completed GH therapy while two were still on hormone replacement. The prevalence of osteopenia was 44% in the entire group, and 67% versus 27% in the R and NR groups. Florid osteoporosis was present in 20% of the entire group, more than 40% of the R group but none of the NR group. A significant correlation (P < 0.01) was observed between overall HRQL and Z scores of bone mineral density (BMD) of the lumbar spine. Pain and ambulation/mobility utility scores correlated significantly (P < 0.05) with BMD, while levels of physical activity correlated (P < 0.05) with overall HRQL utility scores. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study demonstrates that in survivors of brain tumors treated in childhood, radiation therapy is associated with significant loss of bone mineral. Among these survivors, HRQL is less, pain is more severe and ambulation is more restricted in those with low BMD scores. The reduction in HRQL is reflected in diminished physical activity. A larger multi-center study is needed to confirm these results.",['9002-72-6 (Growth Hormone)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Current treatment consists of supportive care plus antibiotics. Clinical trials have attempted to evaluate the use of colony-stimulating factors (CSF) as additional therapy to prevent febrile neutropenia in children with ALL. The individual trials do not show whether there is significant benefit or not. Systematic review provides the most reliable assessment and the best recommendations for practice. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the addition of G-CSF or GM-CSF to myelosuppressive chemotherapy in children with ALL, in an effort to prevent the development of febrile neutropenia. Evaluation of number of febrile neutropenia episodes, length to neutrophil count recovery, incidence and length of hospitalisation, number of infectious disease episodes, incidence and length of treatment delays, side effects (flu-like syndrome, bone pain and allergic reaction), relapse and overall mortality (death). SEARCH STRATEGY: The search covered the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CANCERLIT, LILACS, and SciElo. We manually searched records of conference proceedings of ASCO and ASH from 1985 to 2003 as well as databases of ongoing trials. We consulted experts and scanned references from the relevant articles. SELECTION CRITERIA: We looked for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing CSF with placebo or no treatment as primary or secondary prophylaxis to prevent febrile neutropenia in children with ALL. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently selected, critically appraised studies and extracted relevant data. The end points of interest were:* Primary end points: number of febrile neutropenia episodes and overall mortality (death) * Secondary end points: time to neutrophil count recovery, incidence and length of hospitalisation, number of infectious diseases episodes, incidence and length of treatment delays, side effects (flu-like syndrome, bone pain and allergic reaction) and relapse. We conducted a meta-analysis of these end points and expressed the results as Peto odds ratios. For continuous outcomes we calculated a weighted mean difference and a standardised mean difference. For count data, meta-analysis of the logarithms of the rate ratios using generic inverse variance was employed. MAIN RESULTS: We scanned more than 5500 citations and included six studies with a total of 332 participants in the analysis. There were insufficient data to assess the effect on survival. The use of CSF significantly reduced the number of episodes of febrile neutropenia episodes (Rate Ratio = 0.63; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.46 to 0.85; p =0.003, with substantial heterogeneity), the length of hospitalisation (weighted mean difference (WMD) = -1.58; 95% CI -3.00 to -0.15; p = 0.03), and number of infectious diseases episodes (Rate Ratio=0.44; 95%CI 0.24 to 0.80; p=0.002). In spite of these results, CSF did not influence the length of episodes of neutropenia (WMD = -1.11; 95% CI -3.55 to 1.32; p = 0.4) or delays in chemotherapy courses (Rate Ratio=0.77; 95%CI 0.49 to 1,23; p=0.28) . AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Children with ALL treated with CSF benefit from shorter hospitalisation and fewer infections. However, there was no evidence for a shortened duration of neutropenia nor fewer treatment delays, and no useful information about survival. The role of CSF regarding febrile neutropenia episodes is still uncertain. Although current data shows statistical benefit for CSF use, substantial heterogeneity between included trials does not allow this conclusion.","['81627-83-0 (Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",76,20050720,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2005 Jul 21.,"Although molecular remission is now detected, it is still unknown whether we have the tools to cure B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (referred to as CLL). Nonetheless, several new therapeutic approaches have been introduced in cancer therapy during the last decade, including antiangiogenic therapy, apoptosis-inducing treatment and inhibition of heat shock proteins, farnesyl transferase, tyrosine kinases and proteasomes. These modalities may also be considered in CLL, but additional experimental characterization is required. Further characterization and development of CLL animal models should be a part of this preclinical work (especially xenografting in NOD/SCID animals, but also murine leukemia) to allow a more extensive evaluation prior to clinical trials. Animal models are particularly important for preclinical comparison of pharmacological effects between different disease compartments and for in vivo evaluation of antileukemic immune reactivity. However, T cell targeting therapy seems to have several advantages in comparison to other approaches: (1) based on the current clinical experience one would expect low toxicity for several of these strategies, especially vaccine treatment; (2) several studies have demonstrated that autologous T cells can recognize CLL cells; (3) experimental and clinical evidence suggests that immunotherapy can be combined with chemotherapy. Thus, T cell therapy has a relatively strong scientific basis that justifies further clinical studies of immunotherapy in CLL. Although several of the new pharmacological agents seem to have immunosuppressive effects, at least some of them (e.g. heat shock protein 90 inhibitors, proteasome inhibitors, inhibition of angiogenesis) appear to affect T cells only at relatively high concentrations and may thus be used in combination with immunotherapy.",,88,20050721,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

GTP14564 is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor actively against FLT3. The current study evaluated the single and combined effects of 17-AAG and GTP14564, and the role of FLT3 in their inhibitory effects. The importance of FLT3 mutations was demonstrated using small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeted to FLT3. Similar to FLT3 siRNA, GTP14564 inhibited FLT3 internal tandem duplication (ITD) cells (MV4;11) and FLT3 amplified wild-type cells (SEMK2-M1), but not wild-type FLT3 cells (RS4;11). However, when RS4;11 cells were stimulated with FLT3-ligand, phosphorylation of STAT5 and GTP14564 inhibition were observed. Responses to GTP14564 in all cell types were directly related to the level of STAT5 phosphorylation in the cells. We observed synergistic effects of combined 17-AAG and GTP14564 in cell lines with FLT3-ITD and amplified wild-type FLT3. Combined treatment with 17-AAG and GTP14564 reduced the levels of p-FLT3 and p-STAT5, enhanced G0/G1 arrest and apoptosis in FLT3-ITD and amplified wild-type FLT3. The combination of 17-AAG with FLT3 kinase inhibitors can enhance targeted therapy in leukemias with FLT3 mutations, such as MLL fusion gene leukemias.","['0 (Benzofurans)', '0 (Benzoquinones)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (GTP 14564)', '0 (HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Lactams, Macrocyclic)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Milk Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '1W306TDA6S (Rifabutin)', '4GY0AVT3L4 (tanespimycin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",,,,,['CA087053/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this context, herpes simplex virus type-1 (HSV-1)-derived vectors have proven to be a promising tool for genetic modification of lymphoblastic leukemia cells. Yet, vector-associated viral protein expression might inadvertently modulate vaccine efficacy facilitating both immune evasion and immune stimulation. To explore the issue of immune-stimulation versus immune-suppression in immature lymphoblastic leukemia cells, two types of HSV-1 amplicon vectors, helper virus-dependent and helper virus-free that express the immunomodulatory molecules CD70 and IL-2, were compared with regard to their vector-associated immunomodulatory potential. We first established that lymphoblastic cell lines and primary acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells express HSV receptor genes. Lymphoblastic cell lines were transduced with high efficiency, and in primary ALL cells high gene transfer rates of 47+/-15 and 42+/-14% were obtained with helper virus-dependent and -free HSV-1 amplicon vectors, respectively. The efficacy of the two amplicon vectors to induce antineoplastic responses was assessed in a vaccine setting in mice with pre-existing highly malignant lymphoblastic disease. Treatment of mice with vaccine cells transgenically expressing CD70+IL2 significantly suppressed lymphoblastic cell proliferation and improved survival. Of note, when helper virus-dependent HSV-1 amplicon vectors were used for vaccine preparation, the high immunogenic potential of the vector itself, in the absence of transgenic CD70+IL2 expression, seemed to be sufficient to mediate protection comparable to the antineoplastic response achieved by expression of immunomodulatory molecules. Thus for vaccine generation in B lymphoblastic leukemia, the immunogenic potential of HSV-1 helper virus-dependent amplicon vectors does provide additional benefit to the high transduction efficiency of HSV-1-derived vectors.","['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD27 Ligand)', '0 (CD70 protein, human)', '0 (Cancer Vaccines)', '0 (Cd70 protein, mouse)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factors)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Differentially expressed primary factors inducing the fate of these cell types are still poorly described. The transcription factor Runx3/AML-2 Runx, runt [corrected] dominant factor; AML, acute myeloid leukemia is expressed specifically during the development of CD8 single-positive (SP) thymocytes, where it silences CD4 expression. Deletion of murine Runx3 results in a reduction of CD8 SP T cells and concomitant accumulation of CD4+CD8+ T cells, which cannot down-regulate CD4 expression in the thymus and periphery. In this study we have investigated the role of Runx3 during thymocyte development and CD4 silencing and have identified integrin alpha(E)/CD103 on CD8 SP T cells as a new potential target gene of Runx3. We demonstrate that Runx3 is necessary not only to repress CD4, but also to induce CD103 expression during development of CD8 SP T cells. In addition, transgenic overexpression of Runx3 reduced CD4 expression during development of DP thymocytes, leading to a reduced number of CD4 SP thymocytes and an increased number of CD8 SP thymocytes. This reversal is not caused by redirection of specific MHC class II-restricted cells to the CD8 lineage. Overexpression of Runx3 also up-regulated CD103 expression on a subpopulation of CD4 SP T cells with characteristics of regulatory T cells. Thus, Runx3 is a main regulator of CD4 silencing and CD103 induction and thus contributes to the phenotype of CD8 SP T cells during thymocyte development.","['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (CD8 Antigens)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 3 Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)', '0 (Integrin alpha Chains)', '0 (Runx3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (alpha E integrins)']",,,,,,,['J Immunol. 2005 Nov 1;175(9):6238'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have previously provided experimental evidence regarding the functional cross-talk between MITF, protein inhibitor of activated STAT3, and STAT3 in response to cytokine activation of mast cells. Recent studies have demonstrated that binding of different IgE molecules to their FcepsilonRI induces a spectrum of intracellular events in the absence of specific Ag. In this work, we show for the first time that, in mouse bone marrow-derived mast cells and in rat basophilic leukemia cells, monomeric IgE alone can induce the MITF-protein inhibitor of activated STAT3-STAT3 network of interactions and leads to phosphorylation of MITF at S73 and of STAT3 at both tyrosine 705 and S727. This phosphorylation increases the transcriptional activity of MITF and STAT3 as indicated by mRNA accumulation of their target genes such as Bcl-2, granzyme B, and c-Myc.

We conducted this study to assess the effects of excess weight with a large cohort of Koreans. METHODS: We assessed the relationship between body mass index (BMI) and various cancers in a 10-year follow-up cohort of 781,283 Korean men who were free of prior cancer at baseline. Weight and height were measured, and questionnaires related to health behaviors and medical history were completed. Data on newly developed cancers were obtained from two organizations in Korea. A proportional hazards model was used to examine the relationship between BMI and cancer. RESULTS: Adenocarcinoma in the colon and rectosigmoid, hepatocellular carcinoma, cholangiocarcinoma, adenocarcinoma in the prostate, renal cell carcinoma, papillary carcinoma in the thyroid, small-cell carcinoma in the lung, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and melanoma had positive dose-dependent relationships with BMI (all P < .05). Although no linear trend was found (P = .267), obese men who never smoked with a BMI of >or= 30 kg/m(2) had an increased risk of developing gastric adenocarcinoma (relative risk = 1.73). Other cancers, such as leukemia, multiple myeloma, and gallbladder and pancreatic cancer, did not show significant associations. CONCLUSION: These findings show that, even in Koreans, obesity clearly increases the risk of many types of cancers and the strength of the associations varies with the organ and histologic type. Because these obesity-related cancers are reported to be rapidly increasing in Korea and many other Asian countries, controlling obesity epidemics could be an effective tool for preventing these cancers in these areas.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2005 Jul 20.,"BACKGROUND: Grade IV malignancies of the brain, such as glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), are associated with a dismal prognosis. Autocrine and paracrine loops of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) signaling, as well as other signal transduction pathways, have been postulated to play a role in glioblastoma transformation, and molecules involved in these pathways can potentially serve as targets for therapeutic inhibitory agents. Imatinib, an inhibitor of PDGF receptors alpha and beta, as well as other selected tyrosine kinases, is indicated for treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST). Unfortunately, imatinib, as with many conventional chemotherapeutic agents, has limited efficacy as monotherapy in GBM. In preclinical studies, the chemotherapeutic agent hydroxyurea is demonstrated to have cytotoxic effects additive with imatinib. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We tested the combination of hydroxyurea and imatinib in 30 grade IV progressive GBM patients refractory to chemo- and radiotherapy. All 30 patients were evaluable after a median 19 weeks observation time. RESULTS: Combination therapy with imatinib and hydroxyurea resulted in a 20% response rate, including complete and partial responses. Patients experiencing response or stable disease yielded a combined clinical benefit rate of 57%. Median time to progression was 10 weeks and median overall survival was 19 weeks. Three patients continue to survive on combination therapy, with the shortest duration being 106 weeks. Six-month and 2-year progression-free survival rates were 32% and 16%, respectively. CONCLUSION: The efficacy results, combined with findings that imatinib and hydroxyurea were well tolerated, suggest that this combination shows promise as therapy for GBM.","['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",,20050720,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Given the relevance of FLT3 mutations in AML, we investigated the activity of CHIR-258, an orally active, multitargeted small molecule, with potent activity against FLT3 kinase and class III, IV, and V RTKs involved in endothelial and tumor cell proliferation in AML models. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: CHIR-258 was tested on two human leukemic cell lines in vitro and in vivo with differing FLT3 mutational status [MV4;11 cells express FLT3 internal tandem duplications (ITD) versus RS4;11 cells with wild-type (WT) FLT3]. RESULTS: Antiproliferative activity of CHIR-258 against MV4;11 was approximately 24-fold greater compared with RS4;11, indicating more potent inhibition against cells with constitutively activated FLT3 ITD. Dose-dependent down modulation of receptor phosphorylation and downstream signaling [signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)/mitogen-activated protein kinase] in MV4;11 cells with CHIR-258 confirmed the molecular mechanism of action. Target modulation of phospho-FLT3, phospho-STAT5, and phospho-ERK in MV4;11 tumors was achieved at biologically active doses of CHIR-258. Tumor regressions and eradication of AML cells from the bone marrow were shown in s.c. and bone marrow engraftment leukemic xenograft models. Tumor responses were characterized by decreased cellular proliferation and positive immunohistochemical staining for active caspase-3 and cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, suggesting cell death was mediated in part via apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that CHIR-258 may be an effective therapy in FLT3-associated AML and warrants clinical trials.","['0', '(4-amino-5-fluoro-3-(5-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl)quinolin-2(1', 'H)-one)', '0 (Benzimidazoles)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Quinolones)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Flt3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2005 Jul 20.,"Mutations in the granulocyte-colony stimulating factor receptor (G-CSF-R) gene resulting in carboxy terminal truncation have been associated with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The truncated G-CSF-R from AML patients mediate enhanced and prolonged activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (Stat5). It has been shown that Src homology-2 (SH2)-containing tyrosine phosphatase-1 attenuates the intensity of G-CSF-induced Stat5 activation through interacting with the carboxy terminus of the G-CSF-R. Using a series of tyrosine-to-phenylalanine substitution mutants, we show here that tyrosine (Tyr) 729, located in the carboxy terminus of the G-CSF-R, controls the duration of G-CSF-stimulated activation of Stat5, Akt, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2. It is interesting that activation of these signaling molecules by G-CSF was prolonged by pretreating cells with actinomycin D or cyclohexamide, suggesting that de novo protein synthesis is required for appropriate termination of G-CSF-R signaling. The transcripts for suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) and SOCS1 were up-regulated rapidly upon G-CSF stimulation. Expression of SOCS3 or SOCS1, but not SOCS2 and cytokine-inducible SH2 domain-containing protein, completely suppressed G-CSF-induced Stat5 activation but had only a weak effect on Stat5 activation mediated by the receptor mutant lacking Tyr 729. SOCS1 and SOCS3 also inhibited G-CSF-dependent cell proliferation, but the inhibitory effect of the two SOCS proteins on cell proliferation was diminished when Tyr 729 of the G-CSF-R was mutated. These data indicate that Tyr 729 of the G-CSF-R is required for SOCS1- and SOCS3-mediated negative regulation of G-CSF-R signaling and that the duration and intensity of G-CSF-induced Stat5 activation are regulated by two distinct mechanisms.","['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Socs1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Socs3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 1 Protein)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 3 Protein)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)']",,20050720,,,"['R01 CA092172/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA92172/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01GM60533/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present work 4'-hydroxybiphenyl-4-ylacrylic acids were studied as a novel series of AR. The synthesized compounds were evaluated for their antiproliferative activity in a human promyelocytic leukemia cell line (NB4) and in an ovarian carcinoma cell system including IGROV-1, carrying a functional wild-type p53, and a cisplatin-resistant subline, IGROV-1/Pt-1. The presence of a bulky lipophilic group at position 3' (adamantan-1-yl being the best) and the E configuration of the acrylic moiety appear essential for activity below 1 muM. No substitution on the rings or on the double bond improved the activity. A qualitative correlation between the log P and molecular volume of the 3'-substituent and the antiproliferative activity was found. From the study of a few selected compounds, it appears that the presence of the carboxylic group is an essential requirement for apoptogenic properties but not for antiproliferative activity, this being maintained in amide derivatives. On the other hand, compounds able to induce apoptosis produced a detectable level of genotoxic damage. This observation supports the hypothesis that the genotoxic stress is a critical event mediating apoptosis induction by compounds of this class. Among the compounds investigated, E-3-(3'-adamantan-1-yl-4'-hydroxybiphenyl-4-yl)acrylic acid (2) was chosen for further investigation.","['0 (Acrylates)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biphenyl Compounds)', '0 (Retinoids)', 'PJY633525U (Adamantane)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In total, 1138 newly diagnosed Binet stage A patients managed over the last 10 years outside the setting of clinical trials according to a ""wait and see"" policy form the basis of the present study aimed at investigating prognostic variables affecting disease progression, a surrogate endpoint for overall survival. A 3-stage risk system, simply obtained by summing the variables that proved significant in the multivariate analysis (i.e. short lymphocyte doubling time, advanced Rai substage, high peripheral blood lymphocytosis), is proposed. Clear-cut differences in the 10 year progression-free survival (PFS) were observed among patients scoring 0 (low risk), 1 (intermediate risk), 2-3 (high risk): 67.8, 41.0 and 24.8%, respectively (P<0.0001). The results of the Medical Research Council (MRC) suggesting a better clinical outcome for females prompted us to verify such a gender-related difference within our prognostic categories. Because changes in PFS only reflected gender for patients scoring 0 (P=0.04), the following prognostic subgroups are proposed: (1) females scoring 0; (2) males scoring 0; (3) patients scoring 1-3 whatever gender (10 year PFS: 76.2, 61.4 and 37.8%; P<0.00001). Our long-term database provides an adequate patient sample to generate a generalized risk stratification model based on clinical data. The indolent clinical outcome of women with early CLL is also supported by the higher frequency of the immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable (IgVH) mutational status and lower proportion of 17p and 11q deletions found in such a patient subset in the MRC CLL4 trial.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['GIMEMA CLL Study Group'],,,,,

Perpetual evolution of viruses is reflected in changing disease patterns, so that familiar viruses are sometimes discovered to cause new or unexpected diseases. For example, canine parvovirus (CPV) has regained the ability to infect felids and cause a panleucopenia-like illness. Feline panleucopenia virus (FPV) has been shown to cause fading in young kittens and has recently been implicated as a possible cause of feline idiopathic cardiomyopathy. Molecular scrutiny of viral diseases sometimes permits deeper understanding of pathogenesis and epizootiology. Feline gastrointestinal lymphomas have not, in the past, been strongly associated with retroviral infections, yet some of these tumours harbour retroviral proviruses. Feline leukaemia virus (FeLV) may play a role in lymphomagenesis, even in cats diagnosed as uninfected using conventional criteria. There is strong evidence that feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) can also be oncogenic. The variant feline coronaviruses that cause invariably-fatal feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) arise by sporadic mutation of an ubiquitous and only mildly pathogenic feline enteric coronavirus (FECV); a finding that has substantial management implications for cat breeders and veterinarians. Conversely, canine enteric coronavirus (CECV) shows considerable genetic and antigenic diversity but causes only mild, self-limiting diarrhoea in puppies. Routine vaccination against this virus is not recommended. Although parvoviruses, coronaviruses and retroviruses are the most important known viral causes of canine and feline gastrointestinal disease, other viruses play a role. Feline and canine rotaviruses have combined with human rotaviruses to produce new, reassortant, zoonotic viruses. Some companion animal rotaviruses can infect humans directly. Undoubtedly, further viral causes of canine and feline gastrointestinal disease await discovery.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Eighty-two well-defined sera (including 18 from an OIE reference laboratory) and 399 field sera from New Zealand cattle were tested in five ELISAs and the results compared with the agar gel immunodiffusion (AGID) test and electrophoretic immunoblotting (EIB) results. A polymerase chain reaction-based technique, which could detect BLV-RNA and proviral-DNA, was also evaluated on a subsample of the field cases. RESULTS: Two commercial ELISAs classified 99% of the defined sera correctly, with the other three ranging in their correct classification between 88% and 95%. The ELISAs agreed in their general classification on the majority of the 399 blood samples (91.7%), and with the AGID for more than 95 % of the sera. In a dilution series of the international reference serum E4, the highest dilution with a positive (or suspicious) result ranged from 1:80 to 1:5120. A dilution series of 202 field positive samples tested in the preferred ELISA detected 98% of positive sera at a 15 and 1: 10 dilution, reducing to 78% at a 1:80 dilution of the sera. Agreement between serological tests and PCR was poor, mainly due to failure of the PCR to detect a number of serologically positive animals. CONCLUSION: ELISA tests detected about 10% more reactors than the AGID and the EIB combined. Some ELISA-positive animals were not detected by PCR, raising doubts about the usefulness of PCR-based technology in EBL eradication programmes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SUMMARY: Azacitidine is the first drug in a new class of compounds, known as DNA hypomethylating agents, to receive FDA-approved labeling for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes. It exerts its antineoplastic activity by causing a direct cytotoxic effect on abnormally proliferating hematopoietic cell lines by interfering with nucleic acid metabolism. Azacitidine is rapidly absorbed following subcutaneous injection, with peak plasma concentrations achieved within 30 minutes of administration. Based on promising results in Phase I-II testing, azacitidine entered Phase III testing in all subtypes of myelodysplastic syndromes. Azacitidine was compared with best supportive care, the previous standard therapy for myelodysplastic syndromes, demonstrating improvements in hematologic response, delaying time to progression to acute myelogenous leukemia, and increasing overall survival. Azacitidine is available as sterile lyophilized powder in single-use vials for reconstitution. The recommended dosage of azacitidine for the first treatment cycle is 75 mg/m(2) daily for seven days. The treatment cycle should be repeated every four weeks for a minimum of four cycles. Overall, azacitidine appears to be well tolerated, with the most common adverse effects being myelosuppression, nausea, and vomiting. CONCLUSION: Azacitidine is the first DNA hypomethylating agent approved by FDA for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes and has demonstrated superior efficacy and improvements in patients' quality of life and bone marrow function over supportive care.","['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",32,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated the following SNPs: -1082, -819, -592 in the promoter region of IL10 in a normal (control) population and selected diseases: breast cancer (BrCa), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) by denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) and found distinct genotype and haplotype patterns. DHPLC was performed using the Transgenomic WAVE instrument, a mutational discovery tool that allows for high throughout analysis of SNPs. The principle of DHPLC is based on separation of homo- and heteroduplex formation of individual polymerase chain reaction products at specific melting temperatures and set gradients. The melting temperature selected for each SNP was based on size and sequence of the polymerase chain reaction product (for -1082, 57 degrees C; for -819, 58 degrees C; and for -592, 59.2 degrees C). Before fragment mutational analysis, all samples were denatured at 95 degrees C and slowly reannealed to allow for reassociation of different strands. Heteroduplex samples were easily distinguished from homoduplex samples. In order to identify wild type from homozygous mutant, two homoduplex polymerase chain reaction samples had to be mixed together, denatured at 95 degrees C and reannealed. The homozygous mutant, when combined with wild type, displayed a double peak on chromatogram. Once distinct chromatograms were established for each of the SNPs and the nucleotide changes confirmed by sequencing, genotype and haplotype frequencies were tabulated for the groups studied.",['130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)'],,,,,,PMC2291722,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We compared gold-standard clinical trial data for 175 elderly cancer patients treated in two Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) breast and lung cancer trials (i.e., 45 from trial 9344 and 130 from trial 9730) with contemporaneous ambulatory and in-patient Medicare health insurance claims data from Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). The breast trial participants studied were those elderly enrolled between 1995 and 1997 and treated with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide or this combination with paclitaxel. The lung trial participants studied were those elderly enrolled between 1998 and 2000 and treated with paclitaxel and carboplatin or paclitaxel alone. Comparing CALGB data with Medicare claims, we found the crude sensitivity for chemotherapy administration was 93% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 88% to 96%). Individual chemotherapy agents had similarly high sensitivities, ranging from 81% (95% CI = 70% to 89%) for carboplatin to 91% (95% CI = 79% to 98%) for cyclophosphamide.

We report here that although no such mutations were detected in 44 adult leukemia patients screened, Shp2 expression levels were significantly elevated in primary leukemia cells and leukemia cell lines, as compared with normal hematopoietic progenitor cells. The Shp2 protein amounts correlated well with the hyperproliferative capacity but were inversely associated with the differentiation degree of leukemia cells. Suppression of Shp2 expression induced apoptosis and inhibition of leukemic cell clonogenic growth. Notably, the majority of Shp2 was preferentially localized to the plasma membrane and was constitutively phosphorylated on tyrosine in leukemia cells, and also in normal hematopoietic cells following mitogenic stimulation. Based on these results, we propose that aberrantly increased expression of Shp2 may contribute, collaboratively with other factors, to leukemogenesis.","['0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPN11 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)']",,20050719,,,['CA78 606/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC1895328,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We tested its effectiveness against fusion tyrosine kinases TEL-platelet-derived growth factor receptorbeta (TEL-PDGFRbeta) and FIP1-like-1 (FIP1L1)-PDGFRalpha, which cause chronic myelomonocytic leukemia and hypereosinophilic syndrome, respectively. In vitro, AMN107 inhibited proliferation of Ba/F3 cells transformed by both TEL-PDGFRbeta and FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha with IC50 (inhibitory concentration 50%) values less than 25 nM and inhibited phosphorylation of the fusion kinases and their downstream signaling targets. The imatinib mesylate-resistant mutant TEL-PDGFRbeta T681I was sensitive to AMN107, whereas the analogous mutation in FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha, T674I, was resistant. In an in vivo bone marrow transplantation assay, AMN107 effectively treated myeloproliferative disease induced by TEL-PDGFRbeta and FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha, significantly increasing survival and disease latency and reducing disease severity as assessed by histopathology and flow cytometry. In summary, AMN107 can inhibit myeloid proliferation driven by TEL-PDGFRbeta and FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha and may be a useful drug for treatment of patients with myeloproliferative disease who harbor these kinase fusions.","['0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (TEL-PDGFRbeta fusion protein, human)', '0 (mRNA Cleavage and Polyadenylation Factors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor alpha)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)']",,20050719,,['Blood. 2006 Jun 15;107(12):4970-1; author reply 4972.

This may reflect that non-Hodgkin's lymphoma comprises several distinct disease entities with different etiologies, as some studies have indicated an association between smoking and follicular lymphoma. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between cigarette smoking and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma risk, overall and by subtype. METHODS: As part of a nationwide Danish-Swedish population-based case-control study, we interviewed 3,055 incident non-Hodgkin's lymphoma patients and 3,187 population controls. All lymphomas were uniformly classified according to the WHO classification. We used unconditional logistic regression to estimate adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for the association between cigarette smoking and risk of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. RESULTS: Cigarette smoking was not associated with the risk of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma overall (OR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.87-1.08) nor with the major subgroups such as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (OR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.79-1.10), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (OR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.72-1.02), or follicular lymphoma (OR, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.85-1.24). Female smokers were at a marginally increased risk of follicular lymphoma (OR, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.04-1.92). Men who had ever smoked had a significantly increased risk of T-cell lymphoma (OR, 1.67; 95% CI, 1.11-2.51). No dose-response association with cigarette smoking could be established for any lymphoma subgroup. CONCLUSION: We found little evidence of an association between cigarette smoking and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma risk overall. Although increased risks of follicular lymphoma in female smokers and of T-cell lymphoma in male smokers were suggested, no dose-response relationship was observed, leaving limited support for causality.",,,,,,['5 R02 CA69269-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There are distinctive features of the thrombotic and bleeding complications associated with specific hematologic malignancies. A number of procoagulants can initiate intravascular clotting including tissue factor, cancer procoagulant and interleukin-1. The hematologic malignancy most often associated with intravascular clotting and bleeding is acute promyelocytic leukemia. The pathogenesis of the life-threatening bleeding disorder associated with this uncommon subtype of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is complex and involves disseminated intravascular coagulation, fibrinolysis and proteolysis. Both all-trans retinoic acid and arsenic trioxide result in relatively rapid resolution of the coagulopathy. Intravascular clotting may also be induced by hyperleukocytosis in AML and by the hyperviscosity syndrome observed in multiple myeloma and Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia. In the setting of hematologic malignancies, when thromboembolic complications occur, the presence of comorbid thrombophilic conditions should be excluded. Abnormal platelet production and function contribute to the development of thrombosis in patients with myeloproliferative disorders. The Budd-Chiari syndrome may be observed in patients with myeloproliferative disorders.

The suppression of PMN apoptosis is believed to be beneficial in eradicating pathogens and is implicated in the pathogenesis of human inflammatory diseases. In the present study, canine PMNs were stimulated with recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rhG-CSF) to investigate the in vitro effect on the apoptosis of canine PMNs. Apoptotic cell rates were assessed by flow cytometry in relation to the ability of PMNs to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS). Canine PMN apoptosis was markedly suppressed by rhG-CSF treatment, in association with the retention of the PMN ability to produce ROS. The addition of cycloheximide abolished this suppression by rhG-CSF. Moreover, canine PMNs, which were stimulated by rhG-CSF, expressed high levels of anti-apoptotic mcl-1 gene mRNA, as quantified by real-time polymerase chain reaction method. The results suggest that PMNs, stimulated by G-CSF, could work effectively over a longer period to eliminate pathogens, and that the prolongation of the PMN life-span might occasionally aggravate tissue injuries in dogs. In addition, the suppression of PMN apoptosis seems to be mediated by the induction of anti-apoptotic mcl-1 gene expression.","['0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)']",,20050718,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thirty newly diagnosed CML patients, 21 males and 9 females, aged 14 - 69, were treated with hydroxyurea to keep the white blood cell count less than 20 x 10(9)/L, and then randomized into 2 groups: high-dose IFN group receiving IFN alpha-2b 5MIU 6 times per week for 3 - 6 months and low-dose IFN group receiving IFN alpha-2b 3MIU every other day for 3 - 6 months. Bone marrow was collected every month to Real-time PCR was used to detect the expression of bcr-abl mRNA. Mononuclear cells were isolated and RNA was extracted to detect the expression of fusion gene bcr-abl and a control gene GAPDH. The results were reported as the number of bcr-abl copies/GAPDH copy. RESULTS: The established real-time quantitative PCR method could detect the bcr-abl molecules as low as 50 copies. The intra-assay coefficient of variation (CV) was less than 5% and the inter-assay CV was 5.13%. The median bcr-abl fusion gene expression level of 30 CML patients before IFN therapy was 0.098 (range: 0.010 - 5.799). The bcr-abl expression level decreased by 19.37% and 24.86% in the low-dose and high-dose IFN groups respectively after 3 months' therapy. No significant difference was observed between the two groups (P = 0.398). Relatively more side effects were observed in the high-dose IFN group than in low-dose group. CONCLUSION: RQ-PCR is a reliable method to monitor CML therapy by analyzing fusion gene bcr-abl expression. There is a difference in bcr-abl fusion gene expression levels among the newly diagnosed patients, and low-dose IFN is as effective as high-dose IFN in reducing bcr-abl expression but with less side effects.","['0 (Interferon alpha-2)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Ten CML patients, 5 males and 5 females, aged 21-41, 3 in chronic phase (CP), 4 in accelerated phase (AP) and 3 in blast crisis phase (BP), were treated with imatinib (400-1500 mg/d) before (n = 10) and/or after (n = 6) NST transplantation. The donors were HLA-identical (n = 4), 5/6 antigen-matched (n = 2), 4/6 antigen-matched (n = 2), 3/6 antigen-matched (n = 1) siblings or haplo-identical mothers (n = 2). The preparative regimen included cytoxin (CTX), Ara-C, and fludarabine combined with antithymocyte globulin (ATG) or anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody. Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis consisted of cyclosporine (CSA) and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), or with low-dose methotrexate (MTX) or zenapax. RESULTS: All the 10 patients showed donor cell chimerism at different degree: three had full chimerism (> 95%) and seven mixed chimerism (44%-95%). Mixed chimerism in 6 cases had been transformed into full chimerism during 1.5-10 months after NST transplantation through immunosuppressive agent withdrawal, donor peripheral blood stem cell/donor lymphocyte infusion or treatment of imatinib. The time needed for increase of the number of neutrophils to more than 0.5 x 10(9)/L was 16 d days (10-21 days). The time needed for increase of the number of platelets more than 20 x 10(9)/L was 10 days (4-15 days). 6 cases had I-II degrees acute and chronic GVHD of skin. 2 case had III-IV degrees chronic GVHD. 2 cases died of transplantation-related complication 27 and 45 days after transplantation respectively. One patient died of III-IV degrees cGVHD. Seven patients remained alive after a median follow-up of 14.5 months (7-23 months). The time needed for bcr/abl becoming negative was 33-130 days. None case relapsed during the following-up. CONCLUSION: An effective and safer method for CML, especially advanced CML treatment of NST transplantation combined with imatinib before and after transplantation reduces the leukemic cell load before transplantation, inhibits the proliferation of residual leukemic cells, promotes full chimerism change and enhanced the effect of graft versus leukemia.","['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The therapeutic effects was compared with that of As2O3 alone treatment on 40 newly diagnosed patients and 25 relapsed patients and that of ATRA alone treatment on 36 newly diagnosed patients and 15 relapsed patients. The treatment protocol for the combination group was as following: As2O3 was administered intravenously at a dose of 10 mg/day and ATRA was given orally three times per day at a dose of 10 mg. The complete remission (CR) rate, period to CR, incidence of early death and side effects were observed in the three groups. RESULTS: In the newly-diagnosed patients, there was no significant difference in CR rate among the three groups (92.5% for the As2O3/LD-ATRA group, 83.8% for the ATRA group, and 90% for the As2O3 group respectively). In comparison with As2O3 alone, administration of LD-ATRA to the patients in the As2O3/LD-ATRA group significantly shortened the period to CR (the medium time to CR was 28 days for the As2O3/LD-ATRA group and 39 days for the As2O3 group respectively). As compared to ATRA alone, treatment with As2O3 with low-dose ATRA showed a significantly lower incidence of early death (2.5% for the As2O3/LD-ATRA group and 13.9% for the ATRA group respectively). In the relapsed patients, the CR rate was significantly higher in the group treated with As2O3/LD-ATRA (71.4% for the As2O3/LD-ATRA group, 32.0% for the ATRA group, and 43.0% for the As2O3 group respectively). The combined use of LD-ATRA with As2O3 did not further enhance toxic side effects as compared to As2O3 alone or ATRA alone.

Mononuclear cells were isolated. Total RNA was extracted and mRNA was purified. DNA microarray technique with 12 848 genes was used to analyze the gene expression profiles. RESULTS: The predicted 45 genes were enormously expressed in 21 patients with acute leukemia, which were consistent with the ALL and AML classification standards reported by Golub and others. 7 genes which were overexpressed in multiple-resistant cell line K562-n/VCR were also overexpressed in 6 cases of refractory acute leukemia. Further analysis showed that 31 genes were upregulated in AML (M(4)-M(6)) and ALL but downregulated in AML (M(1)-M(3)). CONCLUSION: This results support the standard Golub has put forward. The reason that adult patients with ALL and subtypes of AML (M(4)-M(6)) have poorer prognosis in comparison with AMLM(1)-M(3) is attributed to alterations in gene expression. Primary drug resistance may be the major characteristics of refractory leukemia.

The bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMNC) were isolated. The cell cycle was examined by flow cytometric analysis. The CHFR mRNA level in the BMNC was measured by RT-PCR. The expression of CHFR protein was detected by Western blotting in 32 of the 65 patients and 8 normal persons as control. RESULTS: (1) The levels of CHFR protein and mRNA were correlated with the cumulative percentages of cells in S phases. (2) The expression level of CHFR protein in 40.6% (13/32) of the AL patients and that of the CHFR mRNA in 60.0% (27/45) of the AL patients were both significantly lower than those of the normal controls. (3) The mean expression level of CHFR protein in the recurrent acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) was 0.71, significantly higher than that of the de novo group (0.38, t = 2.54, P = 0.017). (4) The complete remission (CR) rates in the AL patients with high expression levels of CHFR protein and mRNA were 30.2% and 42.4% respectively, significantly lower than those in the AL patients with low expression levels (88.6% and 85.4% respectively, both P < 0.05). Multivariate analysis showed that CHFR was one of the influencing factors of CR rate of AL patients.

Bone marrow (BM) mononuclear cells were sorted into total, CD34(+) and CD34(-) fractions, and mRNAs globally amplified from each fraction using polyA PCR. The expression profile of the 17 top-ranked genes distinguishing AML and ALL were measured by RT-PCR in five ALL, 26 AML, 12 AML remission, four chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) and nine morphologically normal BM samples.

In contrast to acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), comparably little is known about aberrant methylation in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), a heterogeneous clonal stem cell disorder with a risk of transformation into secondary AML of up to 30%. Recent evidence demonstrates that suppressor of cytokine signalling SOCS-1, a negative regulator of cytokine pathways, may act as a tumour suppressor gene, and inactivation because of hypermethylation was shown in various malignancies. Employing a newly developed quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction-based methylation assay we analysed, for the first time, SOCS-1 methylation in MDS and found disease-specific hypermethylation in 27 of 86 MDS patients (31%). Demethylation experiments provided direct evidence that aberrant methylation of SOCS-1 induces transcriptional silencing in myeloid cells. In addition, by analysing the expression of signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT)-induced genes we provide for the first time evidence that the activity of the Janus kinase/STAT pathway is increased in primary patient samples showing SOCS-1 hypermethylation.","['0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (SOCS1 protein, human)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 1 Protein)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our data shows that approximately 16% of the patients examined had an ITD mutation and over 13% had a mutation in the AL including triplet deletions involving codons 835/836 and point mutations in codon D839.

Mapping of the total protein expression of CEM lymphoblastic leukemia cells following bohemine treatment was performed by 2-D liquid phase separation. Proteins were fractionated by isoelectric points in pH gradient in the first dimension and each of these pI protein fractions was further separated by hydrophobicity using non-porous silica reverse phase chromatography in the second dimension. 2-D protein expression maps of control untreated and bohemine treated cells were generated and inter-sample comparison was performed. Most of the differentially expressed proteins were present at a decreased level after bohemine treatment while there were four proteins, which were up regulated. These proteins representing candidate biomarkers of cancer cell response to the treatment were selected for identification by mass spectrometry. Our results demonstrating down regulation of three histone variants, different in their pI and hydrophobicity, in response to bohemine indicated that anti-mitotic and anti-cancer activities of this compound may be associated with epigenetic regulation at the level of chromatin structure. Furthermore, crk-like adaptor scaffolding protein represents a new important protein family affected by bohemine. This strategy is valuable for comprehensive proteomic analysis of cellular protein targets and pathways that are relevant to anticancer activity of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibition.","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Proteome)', '0 (Purines)', '0 (bohemine)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Antibody-toxin therapy is likewise on the verge of clinical fruition. Accumulating evidence suggests that radioimmunotherapy may have the best impact in minimal-disease and adjuvant settings, especially with radioresistant solid tumors. For the latter, ongoing efforts in 'pretargeting' to increase deliverable tumor radiation dose, combination therapies, and locoregional applications are also of importance. Antibody-drug conjugates have the potential to increase the therapeutic index of chemotherapy by minimizing systemic toxicity and improving tumor targeting. The design of optimal drug conjugates in this regard is predicated upon the proper choice of the target antigen, the cleavable-linker, and the drug. In respect of antibody-toxin conjugates, considerable progress has been made in chemical and recombinant immunotoxin designs, and in the advancement of many products to clinical trials. Continued development of antibody-directed therapies should expand the options available for the management of cancer.","['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Pharmaceutical Preparations)', '0 (Radioisotopes)', 'EC 3.1.- (Ribonucleases)', 'EC 3.4.22.1 (Cathepsin B)']",113,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The compounds, derived from 1,8-dihydroxyanthracene-9,10-dione, were studied for DNA binding and cytotoxicity. Melting temperature, fluorescence quenching, and surface plasmon resonance methods all indicated that the lysine derivative 4d binds to DNA much more strongly that the Pro, Ala, and Gly conjugates whereas the Phe analogue showed the lowest DNA binding capacity. These compounds form intercalation complexes with DNA, as judged from electric linear dichroism and topoisomerase I-based DNA unwinding experiments. Preferential binding of 4d to defined sequences such as 5'-CTAAAGG and 5'-ATGC was evidenced by DNase I footprinting. This Lys conjugate was found to be over 20 times more cytotoxic to CEM human leukemia cells than the other conjugates, with an IC50 in the submicromolar range. A high antiproliferative activity, likely attributable to the enhanced DNA binding capacity, is maintained despite the incapacity of the compound to stabilize topoisomerase-DNA covalent complexes. The cell cycle effects of 4d consisted in an S phase accumulation of cells coupled with a pro-apoptotic action (appearance of hypodiploid sub-G1 cells) which were confirmed by measuring the inhibition of BrdU incorporation into DNA and labeling of phosphatidylserine residues with annexin V-FITC by means of flow cytometry. Altogether, the work provides interesting structure-activity relationships in the oxoazabenzo[de]anthracene-amino acid conjugate series and identifies the lysine derivative 4d as a promising candidate for further in vivo evaluation and drug design.","['0 (Amino Acids)', '0 (Anthracenes)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Topoisomerase I Inhibitors)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'G34N38R2N1 (Bromodeoxyuridine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In a synthetic strategy, a FA unit of 4-O-podophyllotoxinyl 12-hydroxyoctadec-Z-9-enoate 2, a derivative of podophyllotoxin, was functionalized at the C-12 position by incorporating the F atom and N-containing moieties. The FA olefin (Z, C-9/C-10) of 2 was hydrogenated to produce a derivative possessing a hydroxy function (C-12) on a saturated C18 FA chain. In another synthetic strategy, two S-ethers of podophyllotoxin (C4alpha) were synthesized from a terminal unsaturated FA analog, 4-O-podophyllotoxinyl undec-10-enoate. Syntheses were achieved through effective synthetic procedures; 1H NMR, 13C NMR, IR, and high-resolution mass data proved excellent tools to characterize these derivatives. In vitro antitumor activity was investigated against a panel of five human neoplastic cell lines, SK-MEL (malignant, melanoma), KB (epidermal carcinoma, oral), BT-549 (ductal carcinoma, breast), SK-OV-3 (ovary carcinoma), and HL-60 (human leukemia). Keeping in view the severe lack of tumor selectivity of podophyllotoxin over normal cells, we assayed new analogs against noncancerous mammalian VERO (African green monkey kidney fibroblast) cell lines to gauge their extent of toxicity. Several of these compounds showed excellent moderation of antitumor activity. In general, we found excellent growth inhibition against the human leukemia cell line (HL-60), particularly for the analogs containing S-ethers and carbamates. None of the compounds were toxic to normal cell lines.","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cytotoxins)', '0 (Ethers)', '0 (Fatty Acids)', 'L36H50F353 (Podophyllotoxin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Observational study of children admitted to a regional oncology unit from October 1999-April 2002. Primary outcome measure was temperature 72 h after commencing antibiotic therapy; secondary measures were mortality, nephrotoxicity, symptomatic ototoxicity and serum netilmicin levels. RESULTS: 280 episodes for 128 patients (median age 7.1 y) were documented, and 248 episodes were evaluated and compared with a previous cohort of 100 episodes for which the only difference was administration of netilmicin three times daily. Twenty-seven per cent of single-dose netilmicin episodes remained febrile at 72 h compared to 32% in the comparator group (difference -4.7%; 95 % CI: -6.8% to 16.2%; p = 0.41). No patients died and we were unable to find evidence of nephrotoxicity or ototoxicity. Eighty-nine per cent of ""peak"" serum netilmicin levels measured 30 min after infusion were 10 mg/l or greater, and 94% and 86% measured 12-16 h after the first and third dose, respectively, were 1 mg/l or less. Peak serum netilmicin level measurements and 12-16-h measurements after the first dose were abandoned after the first 180 episodes. CONCLUSIONS: Netilmicin can safely be given as a single daily dose to children with febrile neutropenia who do not have biochemical evidence of nephrotoxicity. Monitoring peak serum levels of netilmicin is unnecessary. Levels taken 12-16 h after the third dose are adequate to monitor therapy if used in conjunction with a therapeutic guideline detailing the response to abnormal serum creatinine and netilmicin levels.","['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '4O5J85GJJB (Netilmicin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We applied fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to characterize precisely the types of 6q abnormalities in seven patients (six with acute myeloid leukemia and one with myelodysplastic syndrome). They carried various translocations involving different breakpoints in 6q, as confirmed by FISH using a whole-chromosome-6 paint. Four cases were reported as t(6;11), although the breakpoints varied. Among these, we identified a novel translocation, t(6;11)(q24.1;p15.5), in a patient with acute megakaryoblastic leukemia. Molecular cytogenetic studies using the PAC clone RP5-1173K1 localized the genomic breakpoint on chromosome 11 to within the NUP98 gene. The breakpoint on chromosome 6 was narrowed down to a 500-kb region between BAC clones RP11-721P14 and RP11-39H10. Reverse-transcription PCR was performed using a forward primer specific for NUP98 and a reverse primer for the candidate gene in the 500-kb interval in 6q.

DESIGN: Histopathologic, immunohistochemical, and cytogenetic studies of the inflammatory infiltrate in a case series of histiocytoid Sweet syndrome. SETTING: University departments of dermatology and a private laboratory of dermatopathology. METHODS: Conventional histopathologic study as well as immunohistochemical investigations were performed using the alkaline phosphatase antialkaline phosphatase technique with a large panel of antibodies. In some cases, fluorescent in situ hybridization studies were performed to investigate the presence of the bcr/abl gene fusion. RESULTS: Immunohistochemical studies demonstrated that most cells of the infiltrate showed immunoreactivity for CD15, CD43, CD45, CD68, MAC-386, HAM56, and lysozyme, which is consistent with a monocytic-histiocytic immunoprofile. However, intense myeloperoxidase reactivity was detected in most of the cells with histiocytic appearance, which raised the possibility of specific cutaneous involvement by myelogenous leukemia. Nevertheless, cytologic peripheral blood examinations, fluorescent in situ hybridization studies to investigate the bcr/abl gene fusion, and follow-up of the patients, taken all together, ruled out this possibility. CONCLUSIONS: This case series demonstrates that some fresh cutaneous lesions of Sweet syndrome are histopathologically characterized by an infiltrate mostly composed of cells that may be misinterpreted as histiocytes, when in fact they are immature myeloid cells. We named this histopathologic variant histiocytoid Sweet syndrome, which should not be mistaken with leukemia cutis or other inflammatory dermatoses that are histopathologically characterized by histiocytes interstitially arranged between collagen bundles of the dermis.","['144O8QL0L1 (Diclofenac)', '362O9ITL9D (Acetaminophen)', 'RPK779R03H (aceclofenac)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)']",,,,"['Arch Dermatol. 2005 Jul;141(7):893-5.

Mcl-1 is an anti-apoptotic protein that is particularly important for the development of hematological and biliary malignancies, but the mechanism of action of Mcl-1 is unknown. A number of pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins exhibit their effects by modulating Ca2+ signals, so we examined the effects of Mcl-1 on components of the Ca2+ signaling pathway that are known to regulate apoptosis. Expression of Mcl-1 did not affect expression of the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor or the size of endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ stores. However, mitochondrial Ca2+ signals induced by either Ca2+ agonists or apoptotic stimuli were decreased in cells overexpressing Mcl-1 and increased in cells in which Mcl-1 expression was inhibited. These findings provide evidence that Mcl-1 directly inhibits Ca2+ signals within mitochondria, which may provide a novel mechanism to inhibit apoptosis and thereby promote neoplasia.","['0 (Alexa 488 hydrazide)', '0 (Aniline Compounds)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Carbocyanines)', '0 (Fluo 4)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Heterocyclic Compounds, 3-Ring)', '0 (Hydrazines)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (TO-PRO-3)', '0 (Xanthenes)', '10I3106D4A (rhod-2)']",,20050718,,,"['DK34989/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK45710/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK61747/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The result is a classification that incorporates morphologic, immunophenotypic, genetic and clinical features in an attempt to define biologically and clinically relevant entities. Nevertheless, in many tumor subtypes the pathogenic event is still unknown. Furthermore, well-defined leukemia subgroups exhibit considerable heterogeneity, arousing the suspicion that several molecularly distinct subtypes might exist within the same cytogenetic category. Therefore, an ideal classification system would ultimately be based on the underlying molecular pathogenesis, but such knowledge is not yet available. However, by surveying the expression levels of thousands of genes in parallel, DNA microarrays have recently contributed to an increasingly refined molecular taxonomy of myeloid disorders. This powerful technology is becoming well established and has been used to diagnosis cancer and predict clinical outcome, to discover novel tumor subclasses, to gain insights into pathogenesis, and to identify new therapeutic targets. While many challenges remain ahead, genomic technologies have already demonstrated tremendous potential.

Red blood cells transfusions are the most important component of this supportive care. They transiently relieve anemia symptoms and alleviate their effects on quality of life and daily functioning. Platelet transfusion therapy is less frequently needed, at least in low-risk MDS. Dealing with an increased risk of infections linked to neutropenia, mainly by broad spectrum antibiotics, is also needed, more often in advanced stages of [dict: MDS] or when the MDS evolves to acute myeloid leukemia. Chronic red blood cell transfusions expose patients to various side-effects, including blood components intolerance reactions and alloimmunization risks, but also increased frequency of iron overload, a more significant problem in low-risk heavily transfused MDS patients, who have prolonged life expectancy. The use of growth factors is becoming a more and more important part of current supportive care. High-dose erythropoietin is able to reduce or suppress red blood cell transfusions needs in selected subgroups of MDS.

METHODS: The clinical features of hospital-acquired infections were reviewed and analyzed in 120 patients with malignancies in state of agranulocytosis after chemotherapy. The infection-related factors, classification of the pathogens and therapeutic effect were also analyzed. RESULTS: The hospital-acquired infections involved mostly patients with acute leukemia and lung cancer (70/120), occurring at the site of the respiratory tract (78.89%), oral mucosa, gastrointestinal tract, skin and abdominal cavity, etc. The pathogens responsible for the infection are mainly bacteria, with increased incidence of mycotic infections. The pathogenic bacteria causing the infections were predominately G-bacterium, which were sensitive to meropenem and imipenem/cilastatin. CONCLUSION: Patients with malignancies are at high risk of hospital-acquired infection. Good basic nursing care, intestinal tract disinfection, application of granulocyte-stimulating factors, adequate use of antibiotics and constant vigilance of mycotic infection are the key measures to prevent and treat these nosocomial infections.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report 29 patients with cytogenetic evidence of 11q23 alteration, all of which demonstrate molecular cytogenetic evidence of amplification of the MLL gene by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). In all MLL cases, the patients were clinically classified as having transforming myelodysplasia (RAEB/RAEBT) or AML. An additional patient with AML was found by 24-color and gene-specific FISH to have AML1 oncogene amplification. Four patients had been previously diagnosed with cancer and had received topoisomerase II targeted drug therapy which is known to be associated with fusion transcripts involving the MLL and AML1 genes. MLL amplification appeared in various forms: an atypical banded region that bridges from 11q23 into a dicentric chromosome, expanded regions emanating from band 11q23, chromosome 11 paint-positive rings with ""spoke-like"" MLL amplification, and expansion at sites other than chromosome 11 (including extra markers) in the absence of one of the 11 homologues. The fluorescence pattern in most cases suggests palindromic duplication with neighboring sequences in the long arm of chromosome 11. As opposed to MYCN amplification in hsrs (homogeneously staining regions) and double minutes in neuroblastoma, amplification of MLL in most cases occurred at the site of the gene. All of our patients rapidly developed refractory AML. The frequency and clinical correlations of MLL gene amplification in leukemia will need careful follow-up, since the frequently cryptic amplification described in these cases may not generally provoke confirmatory FISH studies. The reported MLL cases represented about 1% of the total abnormal MDS/AML cases over 8 years. A common cytogenetic profile of 5 q-, -17/17 p-, -18/18 q-, and a missing or abnormal chromosome 11, may help direct appropriate follow-up studies. The MLL and the AML1 oncogenes appear to be the only oncogenes amplified at the natural site of the gene. Both genes also show a high degree of diversity of pathogenic mechanisms of leukemia evolution, including numerous reciprocal fusion genes in transformation to either AML or ALL and gain of function amplification.","['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2005 Jan 5.,"In the 1970s, survival rates after treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) in children and young adults (less than 25 years) in India were poor, even in specialised cancer centres. The introduction of a standard treatment protocol (MCP841) and improvements in supportive care in three major cancer centres in India led to an increase in the event-free survival rate (EFS) from less than 20% to 45-60% at 4 years. Results of treatment with protocol MCP841 between 1984 and 1990 have been published and are briefly reviewed here. In addition, previously unpublished data from 1048 patients treated between 1990 and 1997 are reported. Significant differences in both patient populations and treatment outcome were noted among the centres. In one centre, a sufficiently large number of patients were treated each year to perform an analysis of patient characteristics and outcome over time. Although steady improvement in outcome was observed, differences in the patient populations in the time periods examined were also noted. Remarkably, prognostic factors common to all three centres could not be defined. Total white blood cell count (WBC) was the only statistically significant risk factor identified in multivariate analyses in two of the centres. Age is strongly associated with outcome in Western series, but was not a risk factor for EFS in any of the centres. Comparison of patient characteristics with published series from Western nations indicated that patients from all three Indian centres had more extensive disease at presentation, as measured by WBC, lymphadenopathy and organomegaly. The proportions of ALLs with precursor T-cell immunophenotypes, particularly in Chennai, were also increased, even when differences in the age distribution were taken into consideration (in <18-year olds, the range was 21.1-42.7%), and in molecular analyses performed on leukaemic cells from over 250 patients less than 21-years-old with precursor B-cell ALL, a lower frequency of TEL-AML1-positive ALL cases than reported in Western series was observed. The worse outcome of treatment in Indian patients compared with recent Western series was probably due to the higher rate of toxic deaths in the Indian patients, and possibly also due to their more extensive disease - which is, at least partly, a consequence of delay in diagnosis. Differences in the spectrum of molecular subtypes may also have played a role. The higher toxic death rates observed are likely to have arisen from a combination of more extensive disease at diagnosis, co-morbidities (e.g., intercurrent infections), differences in the level of hygiene achievable in the average home, poor access to acute care, and more limited supportive care facilities in Indian hospitals. Toxic death was not associated with WBC at presentation, and hence would tend to obscure the importance of this, and, potentially, other risk factors, as prognostic indicators. Since the prevalence of individual risk factors varies in different populations and over time, their relative importance would also be expected to vary in different centres and in different time periods. This was, in fact, observed. These findings have important implications for the treatment of ALL in countries of low socioeconomic status; it cannot be assumed that risk factors defined in Western populations are equally appropriate for patient assignment to risk-adapted therapy groups in less affluent countries. They also demonstrate that heterogeneity in patient populations and resources can result in significant differences in outcome, even when the same treatment protocol is used. This is often overlooked when comparing published patient series.",,36,20050105,,,,,"['Eur J Cancer. 2007 Feb;43(3):632. Raina, V [added]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Investigation of the mechanism of CTX III-induced apoptosis revealed that treatment of K562 cells with CTX III resulted in the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, cytochrome c release from mitochondria into the cytosol and activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3 and the subsequent cleavage of the caspase-3 substrate PARP; however, CTX III did not generate reactive oxygen species (ROS). 4.

Thirty-three men with cancer (testicular cancer, lymphoma and leukaemia) and 14 men with proven fertility took part in the study. The study found that in men with cancer, the percentage of spermatozoa with highly condensed DNA was less than that of controls. DNA integrity when assessed using the comet assay was also reduced by cancer. Percentage head DNA intact and percentage of condensed chromatin in the spermatozoa of men with cancer after treatment were less than those in fertile men.

In the past decade, ceramide has been shown to be of crucial significance in several cell functions including apoptosis, cell growth, senescence, and cell cycle control. Among them, the role of ceramide in apoptosis induction has extensively been studied, and ceramide-targeting molecular medicine for apoptosis-based diseases such as malignant tumors, atherosclerosis and neurodegenerative disorders appears to come out to the clinical field. We here describe the recent advances in research of ceramide-mediated apoptosis signaling. We also show the relation of ceramide level through regulation of ceramide-related enzymes (sphingomyelinase, ceramidase, sphingomyelin synthase and glucosylceramide synthase) with diseases such as cancer, leukemia, bacterial infections, AIDS, Alzheimer's disease, atherosclerosis, diabetes mellitus and atopic dermatitis.

Therefore, developing effective therapies is especially important in this country. Investigation of tumour formation and progression on the molecular level is required to develop possible therapeutical targets. Such targets can be proteins with tumour suppressor function, which inhibit intracellular signalling processes that under pathophysiological conditions can lead to uncontrolled cell proliferation and tumour formation. Protein e3B1/Abi-1, which belongs to the family of Abl-interactors, was isolated recently as a possible tumour suppressor. As a partner of Abl kinase, its role has been investigated in the development and progression of some types of leukemias, however, more and more experimental data suggest that it is a general suppressor protein. According to the latest results, e3B1/Abi-1 via the Ras small G-protein has an essential role in the regulation of cell proliferation, and via Rac activation it can affect actin remodelling, cell adhesion and migration. Cell proliferation is important in tumour development, while cell adhesion and migration has a role in metastasis formation. The latest results showed deletion of the gene encoding protein e3B1/Abi-1 in prostate cancer, loss of its expression during the progression of some types of leukemias, and there are data on the effect of imatinib mesylate (Gleevec or outside USA Glivec, Novartis), one of the newest drugs in leukemia treatment, on the phosphorylation of e3B1/Abi-1 as well.

This is ethically appealing because, on average, more patients are assigned to the more successful treatments. Consequently, physicians are more likely to enroll patients onto trials where the randomization is outcome-adaptive rather than balanced in the conventional manner. Outcome-adaptive methods based on a binary variable may be applied by reducing an event time to the indicator of the event's occurrence within a predetermined time interval. This results in a loss of information, however, since it ignores the censoring times of patients who have not experienced the event but whose evaluation interval is not complete. This paper proposes and compares exact and approximate Bayesian outcome-adaptive randomization procedures based on time-to-event outcomes. The procedures account for baseline prognostic covariates, and they may be applied continuously over the course of the trial.

The reactivity of 8 A 7 in normal and neoplastic tissue was examined by performing immunohistochemistry on paraffin-embedded sections. 8 A 7 reacted with lymphocytes in the mantle and marginal zones, but not with lymphocytes in the interfollicular area. Lymphocytes in the germinal centers were found to be negative or occasionally weakly positive for 8 A 7. BAFF-R expression was found only in B-cell lymphoma (44/80, positive cases/examined cases): B-lymphoblastic lymphoma 0/3, B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma 4/4, mantle cell lymphoma 9/11, follicular lymphoma 10/14, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) 11/25, marginal zone B-cell lymphoma 8/10, lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma 2/2, plasma cell myeloma 0/2, and Burkitt lymphoma 0/9, but not in T/NK cell lymphomas (0/19) or Hodgkin lymphoma (0/10). BAFF-R was expressed in most low-grade B-cell neoplasms and a small number of DLBCL, suggesting that BAFF-R may play an important role in the proliferation of neoplastic lymphoid cells. Thus, the mAb is very useful for further understanding of both healthy B-cell biology and its pathogenic neoplasms.","['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (B-Cell Activation Factor Receptor)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (TNFRSF13C protein, human)']",,20050614,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is a significant step towards achieving the ultimate goal of disease-eradication and improved survival. A continuing problem, however, is the susceptibility of these patients to infections. Profound dysregulation of the host immune system in patients with CLL and its impact on the clinical course of the disease are well established. A number of investigators have sought to identify the mechanisms underlying this innate immune dysfunction, which is further exacerbated by the actions of the potent therapeutic agents. The early recognition of infections as well as prophylactic administration of appropriate antibiotics has been the mainstay of managing infections in patients with CLL. Hopefully, increasing understanding of the molecular events underlying the neoplastic change in CLL will lead to more targeted and less immunosuppressive therapeutic modalities. Furthermore, the understanding of the mechanisms of immune dysfunction in CLL is of pivotal importance in the novel immune-based therapeutic strategies currently under development.","['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Immunoglobulins, Intravenous)']",139,20050716,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIAL AND METHODS: DR5, APO2.7 and cell cycle were analyzed by flow cytometry. Proteins Bid and Mcl-1 were analyzed by Western-blotting. For clonogenic survival, colony assay on methylcellulose was used. RESULTS: Ionizing radiation caused significantly enhanced positivity of DR5 receptors 24 h after irradiation with high doses (6 and 8 Gy). An increase of DR5 receptor positivity after a dose of 2 Gy was not statistically significant and application of TRAIL 48 h after irradiation did not increase the apoptosis induction. However, a decrease of radiation-induced G(2) phase arrest and an increase of apoptosis were observed when TRAIL was applied 16 h before irradiation with the dose of 2 Gy. Incubation with 6 microg/l TRAIL for 16 h reduced D(0) value from 2.9 Gy to 1.5 Gy. The induction of apoptosis by TRAIL was accompanied by Bid cleavage and a decrease of antiapoptotic Mcl-1 16 h after incubation with TRAIL. CONCLUSION: TRAIL in concentration of 6 microg/l applied 16 h before irradiation by the dose of 1.5 Gy caused the death of 63% of clonogenic tumor cells, similarly as the dose of 2.9 Gy alone, which is in good correlation with the enhanced apoptosis induction.","['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNFRSF10B protein, human)', '0 (TNFSF10 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",,20050711,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This finding has favored a model of leukemogenesis in which the collaboration of these 2 classes of genetic alterations is necessary for the malignant transformation of hematopoietic progenitor cells. The model is supported by experimental data indicating that AML1-ETO and FLT3 length mutation (FLT3-LM), 2 of the most frequent genetic alterations in AML, are both insufficient on their own to cause leukemia in animal models. Here we report that AML1-ETO collaborates with FLT3-LM in inducing acute leukemia in a murine BM transplantation model.

Human T cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) involvement in MF progression is a matter of debate. The goal of the investigation was to search for HTLV-1 markers in a group of MF patients from a nonendemic area to HTLV-1. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty MF patients and 60 healthy donors from Moscow and the Moscow region were examined for HTLV-1 markers by Western blot, PCR, nested PCR, PCR/Southern hybridization, TaqMan real-time PCR and sequencing. RESULTS: Plasma samples from MF patients were repeatedly negative for antibodies to HTLV-1 structural proteins. HTLV-1 tax-related sequences (corresponding to the second exon) were found in blood from 20 of 50 MF patients and in 3 of 5 saliva specimens. Three of 8 sequenced tax-like amplimers were identical and 5 of 8 contained 1-2 substitutions. tax transcripts and antibodies to p40(tax) were detected in some 'PCR-tax'-positive MF patients. Defective HTLV-1 genomes were demonstrated in 2 of 50 MF patients. Phylogenetic analysis of the defective genome 5'-LTR sequence revealed a relationship with HTLV-1a sequences from the transcontinental subgroup of HTLV-1. CONCLUSIONS: HTLV-1 tax-like sequences were revealed in blood and for the first time in saliva from MF patients living in an HTLV-1 nonendemic region. Expression of tax-like sequences was confirmed by both reverse transcription PCR and Western blot.","['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (HTLV-I Antibodies)']",,,"['Copyright (c) 2005 S.

Several potential roles have been proposed for AF5q31 and other family genes, but the specific requirements of AF5q31 during development remain unclear. Here, we show that AF5q31 is essential for spermatogenesis. Although most AF5q31-deficient mice died in utero and neonatally with impaired embryonic development and shrunken alveoli, respectively, 13% of AF5q31-deficient mice thrived as wild-type mice did. However, the male mice were sterile with azoospermia. Histological examinations revealed the arrest of germ cell development at the stage of spermiogenesis, and virtually no spermatozoa were seen in the epididymis. AF5q31 was found to be preferentially expressed in Sertoli cells. Furthermore, mutant mice displayed severely impaired expression of protamine 1, protamine 2, and transition protein 2, which are indispensable to compact the haploid genome within the sperm head, and an increase of apoptotic cells in seminiferous tubules. Thus, AF5q31 seems to function as a transcriptional regulator in testicular somatic cells and is essential for male germ cell differentiation and survival. These results may have clinical implications in the understanding of human male infertility.","['0 (Aff4 protein, mouse)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Transcriptional Elongation Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Kmt2a protein, mouse)']",,,,,,PMC1190320,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We now show that the Sil protein is hyperphosphorylated during mitosis or in cells blocked at prometaphase by microtubule inhibitors. Cell cycle-dependent phosphorylation of Sil is required for its interaction with Pin1, a regulator of mitosis. Point mutation of the seven (S/T)P sites between amino acids 567 and 760 reduces mitotic phosphorylation of Sil, Pin1 binding, and spindle checkpoint duration. When a phosphorylation site mutant Sil is stably expressed, the duration of the spindle checkpoint is shortened in cells challenged with taxol or nocodazole, and the cells revert to a G2-like state. This event is associated with the downregulation of the kinase activity of the Cdc2/cyclin B1 complex and the dephosphorylation of the threonine 161 on the Cdc2 subunit. Sil downregulation by plasmid-mediated RNA interference limited the ability of cells to activate the spindle checkpoint and correlated with a reduction of Cdc2/cyclin B1 activity and phosphorylation on T161 on the Cdc2 subunit. These data suggest that a critical region of Sil is required to mediate the presentation of Cdc2 activity during spindle checkpoint arrest.","['0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (NIMA-Interacting Peptidylprolyl Isomerase)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (STIL protein, human)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 5.2.1.8 (PIN1 protein, human)', 'EC 5.2.1.8 (Peptidylprolyl Isomerase)']",,,,,,PMC1190358,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have examined erythropoiesis in conditional SCL knockout mice for at least 6 months after loss of SCL function and report that SCL was important but not essential for the generation of mature red blood cells. Although SCL-deleted mice were mildly anemic with increased splenic erythropoiesis, they responded appropriately to endogenous erythropoietin and hemolytic stress, a measure of late erythroid progenitors. However, SCL was more important for the proliferation of early erythroid progenitors because the predominant defects in SCL-deleted erythropoiesis were loss of in vitro growth of the burst-forming erythroid unit and an in vivo growth defect revealed by transplant assays. With respect to erythroid maturation, SCL-deleted proerythroblasts could generate more mature erythroblasts and circulating red blood cells. However, SCL was required for normal expression of TER119, one of the few proposed target genes of SCL. The unexpected finding that SCL-independent erythropoiesis can proceed in the adult suggests that alternate factors can replace the essential functions of SCL and raises the possibility that similar mechanisms also explain the relatively minor defects previously observed in SCL-null hematopoietic stem cells.","['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Tal1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",,,,,"['P01 HL053749/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL069232/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 HL53749-03/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL69232-01/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC1190361,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent reports outline the role of allogeneic antileukemic NK effectors in the graft-versus-leukemia effect but the regulation of NK cell activation in the setting of graft-versus-leukemia effect remains unknown. Here we show that dendritic cells derived from monocytes of CML patients are selectively endowed with NK cell stimulatory capacity in vitro. We further show, using a gene transfer approach in mouse bone marrow progenitors, that ABL/ABL is necessary to promote dendritic cell-mediated NK cell activation. The dendritic cell/NK cell cross-talk in ABL/ABL-induced CML seems unique because JunB or IFN consensus sequence binding protein loss of functions, associated with other myeloproliferative disorders, do not promote dendritic cell-mediated NK cell activation. NK cell activation by leukemic dendritic cells involves NKG2D activating receptors and is blocked by imatinib mesylate. Indeed, ABL/ABL translocation enhances the expression levels of the NKG2D ligands on dendritic cells, which is counteracted by imatinib mesylate.

In this work, we have investigated the capacity of cellular myeloperoxidase to inactivate these agents. We show that incubation of human leukemia HL-60 cells with the anthracyclines in the presence of hydrogen peroxide and nitrite causes irreversible oxidation of the drugs, suggesting an extensive modification of their chromophores. Methimazole, 4-aminobenzoic acid hydrazide, or azide inhibits the reaction, suggesting that it is mediated by the cellular myeloperoxidase, an enzyme naturally present in large amounts in HL-60 cells. In contrast to the intact drugs, the oxidatively transformed anthracyclines were substantially less cytotoxic for HL-60 (assayed by apoptosis) and PC3 prostate cancer cells and H9c2 rat cardiac myoblasts in vitro (assayed by clonogenic survival), indicating that the oxidative metabolism of these agents leads to their inactivation. Using tandem mass spectrometry, we identified two specific metabolic products of the anthracycline degradation, 3-methoxyphthalic acid and 3-methoxysalicylic acid. These two metabolic products were obtained as authentic compounds and were nontoxic to HL-60 leukemic cells and cardiac myocytes. These findings may have important implications for the cellular pharmacology of anthracyclines and for clinical oncology.","['0 (3-methoxyphthalic acid)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Phthalic Acids)', '0 (Salicylates)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 1.11.1.7 (Peroxidase)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",,,,,"['P01 CA66081/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI 34954/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA100045/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most of these CSCs were identified using markers that identify putative normal stem cells. In some cases, stem-like cancer cells were identified using the flow cytometry-based side population technique. In this study, we first show that approximately 30% of cultured human cancer cells and xenograft tumors examined ( approximately 30 in total) possess a detectable side population. Purified side population cells from two cell lines (U373 glioma and MCF7 breast cancer) and a xenograft prostate tumor (LAPC-9) are more tumorigenic than the corresponding non-side population cells. These side population cells also possess some intrinsic stem cell properties as they generate non-side population cells in vivo, can be further transplanted, and preferentially express some ""stemness"" genes, including Notch-1 and beta-catenin. Because the side population phenotype is mainly mediated by ABCG2, an ATP-binding cassette half-transporter associated with multidrug resistance, we subsequently studied ABCG2+ and ABCG2- cancer cells with respect to their tumorigenicity in vivo. Although side population cells show increased ABCG2 mRNA expression relative to the non-side population cells and all cancer cells and xenograft tumors examined express ABCG2 in a small fraction (0.5-3%) of the cells, highly purified ABCG2+ cancer cells, surprisingly, have very similar tumorigenicity to the ABCG2- cancer cells. Mechanistic studies indicate that ABCG2 expression is associated with proliferation and ABCG2+ cancer cells can generate ABCG2- cells. However, ABCG2- cancer cells can also generate ABCG2+ cells. Furthermore, the ABCG2- cancer cells form more and larger clones in the long-term clonal analyses and the ABCG2- population preferentially expresses several ""stemness"" genes. Taken together, our results suggest that (a) the side population is enriched with tumorigenic stem-like cancer cells, (b) ABCG2 expression identifies mainly fast-cycling tumor progenitors, and (c) the ABCG2- population contains primitive stem-like cancer cells.","['0 (ABCG2 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2)', '0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)']",,,,,"['AG023374/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'CA90297/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'ES07784/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA16672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This phenotype is induced by specific acute myeloid leukemia-associated translocations, such as t(15;17) and t(11;17), which involve an identical portion of the retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARalpha) and either the promyelocytic leukemia (PML) or promyelocytic zinc finger (PLZF) genes, respectively. The resulting fusion proteins form high molecular weight complexes and aberrantly bind several histone deacetylase-recruiting nuclear corepressor complexes. The amino-terminal BTB/POZ domain is indispensable for the capacity of PLZF to form high molecular weight complexes. Here, we studied the role of dimerization and binding to histone deacetylase-recruiting nuclear corepressor complexes for the induction of the leukemic phenotype by PLZF/RARalpha and we show that (a) the BTB/POZ domain mediates the oligomerization of PLZF/RARalpha; (b) mutations that inhibit dimerization of PLZF do the same in PLZF/RARalpha; (c) the PLZF/RARalpha-related block of differentiation requires an intact BTB/POZ domain; (d) the mutations interfering with either folding of the BTB/POZ domain or with its charged pocket prevent the self-renewal of PLZF/RARalpha-positive hematopoietic stem cells.

Although this peptide is generated directly within the myocardium, the effects of ANG-(1-7) on cardiac fibroblasts that play a critical role in cardiac remodeling are largely unknown. We tested the hypothesis that specific binding of ANG-(1-7) to cardiac fibroblasts regulates cellular functions that are involved in cardiac remodeling. 125I-labeled ANG-(1-7) binding assays identified specific binding sites of ANG-(1-7) on adult rat cardiac fibroblasts (ARCFs) with an affinity of 11.3 nM and a density of 131 fmol/mg protein. At nanomolar concentrations, ANG-(1-7) interacted with specific sites that were distinct from ANG II type 1 and type 2 receptors without increasing cytosolic Ca2+ concentration. At these concentrations, ANG-(1-7) had inhibitory effects on collagen synthesis as assessed by [3H]proline incorporation and decreased mRNA expression of growth factors in ARCFs. These effects of ANG-(1-7) contrasted with effects of ANG II. Pretreatment of ARCFs with ANG-(1-7) inhibited ANG II-induced increases in collagen synthesis and in mRNA expression of growth factors, including endothelin-1 and leukemia inhibitory factor. ANG-(1-7) pretreatment also inhibited the stimulatory effects of conditioned medium from ANG II-treated ARCFs on [3H]leucine incorporation and atrial natriuretic factor mRNA expression, markers of hypertrophy, in cardiomyocytes. Thus ANG-(1-7) interacted with specific receptors on ARCFs to exert potential antifibrotic and antitrophic effects that could reverse ANG II effects. These results suggest that ANG-(1-7) may play an important role in the heart in regulating cardiac remodeling.","['0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '9007-34-5 (Collagen)', '9041-90-1 (Angiotensin I)', 'IJ3FUK8MOF (angiotensin I (1-7))', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,20050715,,,"['R01 HL066012/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-66012/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-HL-63909/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our previous investigation using a non-human primate model has demonstrated that morphological alterations are initiated even before the embryo invades the endometrium. The present study was undertaken to determine whether the embryo-induced morphological changes are accompanied by any alteration in the protein levels of the immunomodulatory cytokines and their regulators in the preimplantation stage endometrium. METHODS: The endometrial expression of immunosuppressive factors such as transforming growth factor beta2 (TGFbeta2), glycodelin (PP14), leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were analysed on day 6 post-ovulation in pregnant and non-pregnant bonnet monkeys (Macaca radiata) using immunohistochemical methods. RESULTS: The endometrial expression of TGFbeta2, TGFbeta2 receptor, PP14 and IL-6 were significantly up-regulated (p < 0.05) in pregnant animals as compared to non-pregnant animals, whereas the expression of LIF and its receptor remained unaltered in pregnant animals. CONCLUSIONS: Expression levels of some immunomodulatory cytokines in endometrium are significantly increased even before the embryo invades the endometrium.

Although the mechanism by which hydrosalpinges affects fertility is not entirely understood, an adverse effect on endometrial receptivity has been postulated. In this study, we hypothesized that the adverse effects of hydrosalpinges on fertility may be in part mediated by inappropriate endometrial expression of leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF), a cytokine implicated in implantation. METHODS: In order to test our hypothesis, we prospectively examined the expression of LIF during the window of implantation in the endometrium of infertile women (n = 10) with hydrosalpinges prior to and following salpingectomy and of fertile controls (n = 10) by Western blotting and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: LIF expression was significantly lower in infertile women with hydrosalpinges compared with fertile controls (P < 0.05). Salpingectomy resulted in an increase in LIF expression in eight out of 10 women with hydrosalpinges. LIF levels were increased by 231 +/-49% (mean +/- SEM) following salpingectomy. Immunohistochemical analysis confirmed the Western blot findings. The increased LIF immunoreactivity was predominantly localized to luminal and glandular epithelial cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that observed benefit from salpingectomy in infertile women with hydrosalpinges may be in part mediated by the up-regulation of endometrial LIF expression.","['0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)']",,20050715,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was found that compounds 1a, 2a, 5, 6a, 6b and 7 possess significant cytotoxicity against HL-60 cells (IC(50)<50 microM) and that the cytotoxic activity is associated with the cell apoptosis. SAR analysis demonstrates that the following structural determinants contribute critically to the enhancement of the activity: (i) acetoxyl groups at 3- and/or 5-positions of the side chain; (ii) the appropriate longer alkyl side-chain length; (iii) the ortho-diphenoxyl functionality on the aromatic ring; (iv) the alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone moiety in the side chain.

Epub 2005 Jul 18.,"A large number of observations have hinted at the fact that location impinges on function of some of the main players of nuclear inositol lipid cycle. PLC beta1 is a well-known example, given that it has been shown that only the enzyme located in the nucleus targets the cyclin D3/cdk4 complex, playing, in turn, a key role in the control of normal progression through the G1 phase of the cell cycle. The PLC beta1 gene, which is constituted of 36 small exons and large introns, maps on the short arm of human chromosome 20 (20pl2, nearby markers D20S917 and D20S177) with the specific probe (PAC clone HS881E24) spanning from exon 19 to 32 of the gene itself. The chromosome band 20pl2 has been shown to be rearranged in human diseases such as solid tumors without a more accurate definition of the alteration, maybe because of the absence of candidate genes or specific probes. Moreover, non-specific alterations in chromosome 20 have been found in patients affected by MDS and acute myeloid leukemia AML. MDS is an adult hematological disease that evolves into AML in about 30% of the cases. The availability of a highly specific probe gave an opportunity to perform in patients affected with MDS/AML, associated with normal karyotype, painting and FISH analysis aimed to check the PLC beta1 gene, given that this signaling molecule is a key player in the control of some checkpoints of the normal progression through the cell cycle. FISH analysis disclosed in a small group of MDS/AML patients with normal karyotype the monoallelic deletion of the PLC beta1 gene. In contrast, PLC beta4, another gene coding for a signaling molecule, located on 20pl2.3 at a distance as far as less than 1 Mb from PLC beta1, is unaffected in MDS patients with the deletion of PLC beta1 gene, hinting at an interstitial deletion. The MDS patients, bearing the deletion, rapidly evolved to AML, whilst the normal karyotype MDS patients, showing non-deletion of PLC beta1 gene, are still alive at least 24 months after the diagnosis. The immunocytochemical analysis using an anti PLC beta1 monoclonal antibody showed that all the AML/MDS patients who were normal at FISH analysis also had normal staining of the nucleus, which is a preferential site for PLC beta1. In contrast, the monoallelic deletion gave rise to a dramatic decrease of the nuclear staining suggesting a decreased expression of the nuclear PLC beta1. The reported data strengthen the contention of a key role played by PLC beta1 in the nucleus, suggest a possible involvement of PLC beta1 in the progression of MDS to AML and pave the way for a larger investigation aimed at identifying a possible high risk group among MDS patients with a normal karyotype.","['0 (Isoenzymes)', 'EC 3.1.4.- (Type C Phospholipases)', 'EC 3.1.4.11 (PLCB1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.4.11 (PLCB4 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.4.11 (Phospholipase C beta)']",,20050718,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To study the effect of female hormones, 17beta-estradiol and progesterone were added in different concentrations (10(-3) M to 10(-12) M) to a culture of persistently FeLV-infected cells. The effect of both hormones was very similar. After 24 h the cell viability was very low at 10(-3) M and 10(-4) M but similar to controls at the remaining concentrations. Liberation of viral particles was estimated by the reverse transcriptase activity (RT), which was the lowest also at 10(-3) M and 10(-4) M. However, low viability could not account for this low RT, as when cells were lysed with lysis buffer RT was high. Thus, cells were dying without freeing viral particles, suggestive of apoptosis. This possibility was confirmed by staining hormone-treated cells with annexin V and propidium iodide. The FeLV antigen p27 measured in the cultures had a maximum at 10(-3) M and 10(-4) M, higher than controls and lysed cells, so the presence of p27 in the supernatant was not only due to cell lysis but a consequence of hormone effect. In conclusion, 17beta-estradiol and progesterone induce death of FeLV-infected cells at high concentrations, probably through a process of apoptosis, which might limit the spread of the infection, as infective viral particles would be hampered from budding.","['0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)', '0 (feline leukemia virus protein p27)', '4G7DS2Q64Y (Progesterone)', '4TI98Z838E (Estradiol)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We isolated a marine prostanoid, bromovulone III, from soft coral Clavularia viridis and found that it displayed effective anti-tumor activity in human hepatocellular carcinoma. The anti-tumor mechanism has been delineated in this study. METHODS: Anti-tumor efficacy and apoptotic cell death were examined by sulforhodamine B and Hoechst 33342 assays. Rhodamine 123 was used to measure the change of mitochondrial membrane potential. Immunoprecipitation and Western blotting detect the involvement of several apoptosis-related proteins. Electron microscopic examination detects the morphological change of mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum (ER). RESULTS: Bromovulone III primarily induced mitochondria-related activation of caspase-9 and -3 in several tumor types, such as prostate cancer PC-3 and acute promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells. However, it primarily induced the activation of m-calpain, caspase-12, and transcription factor CHOP/GADD153 in hepatocellular carcinoma Hep3B cells, suggesting the involvement of ER stress. Furthermore, a secondary mitochondrial swelling and depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential were subsequently triggered after ER stress, suggesting the crosstalk between ER and mitochondria. CONCLUSIONS: It is suggested that bromovulone III induces apoptosis in Hep3B cells through a mechanism that induces ER stress and leads to activation of CHOP/GADD153 and caspase-12.",['0 (Prostaglandins)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, a significant proportion of patients chronically treated with Gleevec develop resistance. Here we describe the activity of a natural small molecular compound, berbamine from plant Berberis amurensis that can selectively induce cell death of both Gleevec-sensitive and -resistant Ph+ CML cells. The IC50 values of berbamine were 8.80 microg/ml in Gleevec-sensitive Ph+ CML cells, 11.34 microg/ml in Gleevec-resistant Ph+ CML cells, and 54.40 microg/ml in Ph- KG-1 cells, respectively. Similarly, berbamine was also found to display a selective anti-proliferative activity of primary leukemia cells from CML patients, and its IC50 values were 4.20-10.50 microg/ml in primary CML cells, and 185.20 microg/ml in normal bone marrow cells, respectively. More importantly, our studies demonstrate that berbamine down-regulates p210bcr/abl oncoprotein level, and induces apoptosis of bcr/abl+ cells through caspase-3-dependent pathway.

In the present study, in order to assess the chemical structure-effect relationship of DIF derivatives and to develop useful agents for the study of both Dictyostelium development and cancer biology, we synthesized 28 analogues of DIF-1 and DIF-3 and investigated their stalk-cell-inducing activity in Dictyostelium HM44 cells (mutant strain) and anti-proliferative activity in human leukemia K562 cells. HM44 cells are defective in endogenous DIF-1 production and should be suitable for the assay for stalk-cell-inducing activity of DIF analogues. DIF-1 and some of its derivatives at nanomolar levels were good stalk-cell inducers in HM44 cells, whereas DIF-3 and some DIF-3 derivatives at micromolar levels were potent anti-proliferative agents in K562 cells. We also tried to search for antagonistic molecules against DIF-1 and DIF-3 but failed to find such molecules from the analogues used here. The present findings would give us hints for identifying the target molecule(s) of DIFs and also for developing novel anti-cancer drugs.","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Differentiation-inducing factor-1, Dictyostelium)', '0 (Hexanones)', '0 (Hydrocarbons, Chlorinated)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previously, sympathetic neurons in vivo were shown to respond to a conditioning lesion with decreased neurite outgrowth, in contrast to the enhanced outgrowth observed in all other peripheral neurons examined. The present experiments tested the effects of a conditioning lesion on neurite outgrowth in vitro from the superior cervical ganglion (SCG) and the impact of several factors on that response. Ganglia axotomized 1 week earlier and then explanted in Matrigel or collagen gel responded with a significant increase in neurite extension compared to sham-operated ganglia. A distal axotomy produced by unilateral removal of the salivary glands (sialectomy) caused an increase in neurite outgrowth similar to that of a proximal axotomy. These conditioning lesions induced both an increase in the rate of elongation, and, in the case of the proximally axotomized SCG, a shorter initial delay of outgrowth. The enhanced outgrowth following sialectomy was specific to the nerve containing the majority of axons projecting to the salivary glands, suggesting that the conditioning lesion effect is restricted to previously injured neurons. Deletion of the gene for leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), a gene induced by axotomy, did not abolish the conditioning lesion effect in SCG explants or dissociated cell cultures. In conclusion, sympathetic neurons are capable of responding to a conditioning lesion with increased neurite outgrowth. The hypothesis that the neuronal cell body response to axotomy plays an important role in the conditioning lesion response is discussed.","['0 (Drug Combinations)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Laminin)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Proteoglycans)', '119978-18-6 (matrigel)', '9007-34-5 (Collagen)']",,,,,"['NS17512/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 EY11373/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 EY07157/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She was a carrier of HTLV-I virus, and developed subacute right hemiparesis and marked motor aphasia. She had a malignant lymphoma in the left neck and basal cell carcinoma in the right inguinal region. Three months after the onset, she became unable to walk because of the right leg weakness or to speak because of motor aphasia. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed multifocal T2-high lesions in the white matter of the left frontal lobe, and a brain biopsy revealed demyelinating pathology. A biopsy of the left parotid gland revealed a diffuse pleomorphic type large B cell lymphoma. Although anti-HTLV-I antibody was positive in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), no adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) cells were found in the blood or CSF. The patient was then admitted to our hospital. Neurological examinations revealed severe motor aphasia, mild sensory aphasia/cognitive impairment, right hemiplegia, mild right hemihypesthesia, limb-kinetic apraxia in the left hand, idiomotor apraxia, agraphia, perseveration, marked spasticity and brisk tendon reflex in four extremities, and positive bilateral pathological reflexes. MRI showed multifocal T2-high lesions mainly in the cerebral white matter, predominantly in the left hemisphere, and partly in the cerebral cortex. No gadolinium enhancement was found. In addition, 99mTcECD-SPECT showed a broad decrease in cerebral blood flow (CBF) in the cortex. Anti-HTLV-I antibody was positive but anti-HIV antibody was negative in serum. ATL cells were found in 1-3% of the peripheral white blood cells after admission. CSF examination revealed that the cell count (1/microl), protein level (24 mg/dl), and IgG index (0.4) were all normal. However, the myelin basic protein level (321 pg/ml; normal < 102) was increased, JC virus DNA was detected by PCR, and anti-HTLV-I antibody (x 8) was detected in CSF. The regulatory region of the JC virus DNA in the CSF was partly deleted; immunostaining with anti-JC virus protein antibodies revealed the existence of JC virus in biopsied brain specimens, and these findings were consistent with PML. Her symptoms such as motor aphasia, cognitive dysfunction and left hemiparesis were subacutely progressive, and she developed akinetic mutism two weeks after admission. Since the efficacy of cytosine arabinoside for PML has been reported, she was administered 80 mg/day of the drug for five days. After treatment, her communication function was mildly improved but the efficacy was transient. Since it has been reported that HTLV-I, as well as HIV, activates the JC virus promoter and its proliferation, the latent infection of HTLV-I in the central nervous system (CNS) in this case might have stimulated the JC virus proliferation, promoting lesion extension over the cerebral cortex. There have been only a few reports of broad decreases in CBF by SPECT in PML patients. Further MRI and SPECT studies on PML patients are therefore necessary to evaluate the significance of HTLV-I in promoting the JC virus infiltration into the CNS.",,16,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous studies have indicated that in Baf-3, interleukin (IL)-3-dependent cells, apoptosis is caused predominantly by Bim, a BH3-only cell death activator that belongs to the Bcl-2 superfamily. Because Bim mRNA is induced by IL-3 starvation, we hypothesized that signals originating from the IL-3 receptor might regulate the expression of Bim at the level of its transcription. Here, we identified the transcriptional initiation site and three candidate remote enhancer/silencer regions of the Bim gene. We show that the region of the gene upstream of the initiation site exhibits strong promoter activity and that there are negative regulatory regions within the first intron. However, none of these transcriptional regulatory elements was IL-3-dependent. In addition, a nuclear run-off assay revealed a similar rate of transcription initiation in the absence or presence of IL-3. Although others have demonstrated the transcriptional regulation of Bim by nerve growth factor (NGF) in neuronally differentiated PC12 pheochromocytoma cells, this is unlikely to be the mechanism through which IL-3 downregulates the expression of Bim in Baf-3 cells.","['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BCL2L11 protein, human)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Bcl2l11 protein, mouse)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '9061-61-4 (Nerve Growth Factor)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHOD: We assessed 77 survivors of childhood ALL (n = 51) or CNS tumours (n = 26), aged between 8-18 years, and free from disease for > or = 4 years. Survivors and their mothers independently rated survivors' QOL, and mothers completed semi-structured interviews to determine their views of the benefits and disadvantages of GHT. RESULTS: Survivors, especially those treated for a CNS tumour, reported poorer QOL compared with UK population norms. Although survivors of ALL reported better QOL than survivors of CNS tumours, there were no differences depending on whether or not they were prescribed GHT. However, mothers reported that those prescribed GHT had worse QOL than those not. All but 2 survivors were responsible for their own injections. A minority of mothers were disappointed with the child's rate of growth, and reported that children experienced pain with injections. CONCLUSION: We conclude that QOL in survivors of childhood cancer is compromised compared with the normal population, especially following CNS tumours. Longitudinal studies are vital to determine whether GHT can contribute to improved QOL for cancer survivors, especially those who experience more intensive initial therapy regimes.",['12629-01-5 (Human Growth Hormone)'],,20050713,"['Copyright 2005 S.

We examined the effects of Phx-1 on Jurkat cells, a human T cell line. Phx-1 inhibited proliferation of the cells in a dose-dependent manner but hardly induced cell death, suggesting that Phx-1 acts primarily as an antiproliferative reagent but not as a cytocidal drug. Phx-1 enhanced tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)-induced apoptotic cell death about 100-fold. Tumor necrosis factor alpha, which alone does not induce cell death of Jurkat cells, caused apoptosis in combination with Phx-1. These enhancements of cell death were not due to up-regulation of the death receptors.

Sustained engraftment was attained in all evaluable patients. With a median follow-up of 25.9 months (range, 3.7-61.2 months) in surviving patients, probabilities of overall survival for patients who received a transplant in CR and non-CR were 81% and 21% at 2 years, respectively.

Epub 2005 Jul 14.,"Telomerase catalytic subunit (hTERT) has been shown to play a critical role not only in telomere homeostasis but also in cellular survival, DNA repair, and genetic stability. In a previous study, we described that tumor necrosis factor-xalpha (TNFxalpha) induced in the leukemic KG1 cells a senescence state characterized by decreased hTERT activity followed by prolonged growth arrest, increasedx beta-galactosidase activity, telomere shortening, and major chromosomal instability. Interestingly, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) abrogated all these events. In the present study, we show for the first time that TNFxalpha acts by inhibiting the hTERT gene in both normal CD34x+ cells and fresh leukemic cells. Using KG1 cells as a representative cellular model, we show that TNFxalpha induced sphingomyelin hydrolysis, ceramide production, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation, all of which are critical components of TNFxalpha signaling, resulting in hTERT gene inhibition. Moreover, we provide evidence that the protective effect of GM-CSF is related to its capacity to interfere with both ceramide generation and ceramide signaling. Negative regulation of the hTERT gene may represent one mechanism by which TNFxalpha interferes with normal hemopoiesis.","['0 (Ceramides)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)']",,20050714,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, new methods have been developed to monitor cytotoxic T lymphocyte degranulation. These include detecting the appearance of lysosome-associated membrane protein on the cell's surface, and monitoring decreases in cellular perforin content. We have combined these methods with microscopy and flow cytometry to provide the first analysis of how single cytotoxic T cells degranulate. We used TALL-104 human leukaemic cytotoxic T cells as a model system, and stimulated them with thapsigargin and PMA, soluble agents that mimic the two major signalling pathways activated by T cell receptor cross-linking. Our results indicate that essentially every TALL-104 cell responds to maximal stimulation by releasing about half of its lytic granule complement. This reflects complete release of the contents of half the cell's granules, rather than partial release of the contents of all of the granules. Sub-maximal stimulation reduces both the fraction of cells that respond and the magnitude of single cell responses. We find that individual cells respond to maximal stimulation with a variable latency, and provide evidence that, once it starts, degranulation is a slow process taking tens of minutes.","['0 (Lysosomal-Associated Membrane Protein 1)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Pore Forming Cytotoxic Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '126465-35-8 (Perforin)', '67526-95-8 (Thapsigargin)', '69861-90-1 (thiobenzyl benzyloxycarbonyl-L-lysinate)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (GZMB protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Granzymes)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Serine Endopeptidases)', 'K3Z4F929H6 (Lysine)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,20050714,,,"['R01 AI054839/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 NS007083/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 NS07083/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']",PMC1474224,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to evaluate abnormalities in bone mass and mineral homeostasis in children with ALL after induction therapy (during consolidation treatment). Lumbar spine (L2-L4) bone mineral density (BMD, g/cm(2)) was measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry in 20 children with ALL, a median of 25.9 months postdiagnosis and results were expressed as z-scores relative to healthy Caucasian children (controls). Serum levels of intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), calcium, phosphate, and magnesium were also analyzed. In addition, the body mass indexes (kg/cm(2)) of patients and controls were calculated. Results were compared with those of 40 healthy controls. Among the 20 children with ALL (12 boys and 8 girls), 12 presented z-scores < 1 SD (normal) and 8 were osteopenic (z-score between 1 and 2.5 SD). In addition, children with ALL had reduced lumbar BMDs (z-score -0.817) in comparison to healthy controls (z-score -0.353) (p = .04). Moreover, alkaline phosphatase and intact parathyroid hormone values were significantly increased compared to controls values.

The authors reviewed MR and CT scans of 3 children with biopsy-proved CNS lymphoma. One child had tumor infiltration within the optic nerve sheaths and optic chiasm by previously known non-Hodgkin lymphoma. In 2 patients, CNS lymphoma developed 8 and 10 years after initial ALL treatment. In both cases CNS lymphoma was preceded by cranial irradiation and leukoencephalopathy. A single lesion was present in 3 out of 4 patients. All lesions were isointense or hypointense on the T1-weighted images relative to gray matter and showed homogeneous enhancement. One lesion was centered in the central gray matter, one lesion was centered within a cerebral hemisphere, one lesion was in optic nerve, and there were 2 parasellar lesions. CNS lymphoma has a variable appearance in children. Knowledge of risk factors in children may help in the early recognition of disease, allowing for timely intervention.

Thus, it was somewhat surprising that according to the currently available literature the incidence of TEL/AML1+ BCP ALL is extremely low in patients with Down syndrome (DS). To further investigate this issue in a population-based fashion, the authors retrospectively assessed the number of DS patients with a TEL/AML1+ ALL in two consecutive Austrian ALL multicenter trials. Accordingly, they were able to analyze 8 of 10 individuals with DS and a BCP ALL, two of whom who suffered from a TEL/AML1+ leukemia. Based on this observation they concluded that individuals with BCP leukemia and a constitutional trisomy 21 may have similar likelihood to have a TEL/AML1 rearrangement as BCP ALL patients without this specific predisposing factor.","['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (TEL-AML1 fusion protein)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['Austrian Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster Group'],,['Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2005 Jan-Feb;22(1):11-6.

The 39 different hox genes are organized into four unlinked chromosomal gene clusters (hoxA-D) in mammals and a number of studies have suggested that hox genes play important roles in human leukemogenesis. Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) cells carrying the PML-RARa fusion protein, respond well by differentiating in their response to an all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) treatment. We examined the expression of the individual hox genes during this differentiation. Besides the constitutive expression of hoxA9 and no expression of hoxB7, the expression of hoxC4 increased significantly during differentiation of NB4 cells (PML-RAR(alpha)+). We also examined the expression of hoxC4 in bone marrow cells from APL patients and found that the hoxC4 expression was reproducibly induced during an ATRA treatment. To further examine this finding, HoxC4 was stably expressed in NB4 cells by retroviral transduction. The NB4 cells expressing HoxC4 showed differentiated phenotypes including a CD14 expression, which strongly suggests that upregulated hoxC4 is functionally involved in NB4 cell differentiation in response to ATRA. Upregulation of CD14 is at the transcription level and mediated by the homeodomain of the HoxC4.","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (HOXC4 protein, human)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharide Receptors)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One hundred and thirty patients received chemotherapy consolidation courses, 50 received autologous stem cell transplantation (SCT), and 43 underwent allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT), while 39 did not receive any additional therapy.

Three year EFS was 68 vs. 23% with autologous SCT and allogeneic BMT in M3 patients and, respectively, 41 vs. 20% in non-M3 patients.

She was given cyclosporine and prednisolone orally to treat chronic GVHD after PBSCT. Liver dysfunction first developed 25 months after transplantation with the appearance of hepatitis B s antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg), and elevation of HBV-DNA up to 4.5 log copies/ml. Retrospective examination of her serum before PBSCT proved negative for HBsAg and HBeAg, and positive for anti-HBsAg, anti-HBeAg, anti-hepatitis B core antigen, and HBV-DNA (2.7 log copies/ml), showing that she was in a state of occult HBV infection. Nucleotide sequences of the HBV genome obtained from her serum showed no core promoter mutations at nt 1762 and 1764 and no pre-core mutation at nt 1896. Polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism showed that she was infected with HBV genotype B. The administration of lamivudine, a nucleoside analog, improved her liver function and reduced HBV-DNA replication. We conclude that antiviral agents, such as lamivudine, are effective for treating hepatitis B reactivation during immunosuppressive treatment, such as for GVHD. The administration of a nucleoside analog before transplantation should also be considered in the light of HBV genotypes and mutations, even if HBsAg was negative and the viral load was low before transplantation.","['0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '2T8Q726O95 (Lamivudine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To date, such strategies in childhood T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) have proved elusive, and in vitro drug sensitivity testing has had limited success in T-ALL due to poor T-cell lymphoblast survival in vitro. We have developed the flow cytometric drug sensitivity assay (FCDSA) to evaluate in vitro drug sensitivity. We studied 68 cases of childhood T-ALL for cytarabine (Ara-C) and daunorubicin sensitivity by FCDSA and compared the results with those obtained by MTT assay. Spontaneous apoptosis was correlated with cytotoxicity rates for both drugs by FCDSA, but not with the results obtained by MTT assay. Daunorubicin sensitivity had a positive correlation with Ara-C in individual cases by FCDSA; but not by MTT assay. Studies repeated on stored samples had comparable results for both drugs by FCDSA (P<0.01), but not for Ara-C by MTT assay. Comparison of T-ALL sensitivity with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cases revealed a unique pattern difference.

The liposomal formulation of daunorubicin (DaunoXome, L-DNR) has been reported to produce high mean area under the plasma curve (AUC) levels due to a slow distribution of the liposomal moiety into the body and also to reduce the conversion of daunorubicin to the toxic, but inactive, daunorubicinol. Animal and in vitro studies have shown increased intratumor and intracellular levels of the drug, resulting in enhanced cytotoxicity, even in multidrug-resistant cell lines, while normal tissue toxicity, including cardiotoxicity, may be reduced. L-DNR has been tested as a single agent or in combination with arabinosyl cytosine in the treatment of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in relapse or in patients with newly diagnosed AML or with disease failing initial remission-induction therapy. The results have indicated that L-DNR can be used at high doses, up to 150 mg/m(2) for 3 days, safely with acceptable toxicity. The anti-leukemia activity has been reported to be at least equal or superior to that of free daunorubicin. Mucositis appeared more frequently than cardiotoxicity and high complete remission rates have been reported in patients with AML in first relapse. However, the superiority of L-DNR with regard to efficacy and toxicity will only be shown by prospective clinical studies comparing?L-DNR with free daunorubicin or other regimens. Two comparative trials are currently active in AML patients, one in children and another in the elderly, run by the international BFM and GIMEMA groups, respectively.","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",48,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We describe a patient with longstanding HCL in complete remission after cladribine, in whom extranodal Hodgkin's lymphoma appeared 8 years after the diagnosis of HCL. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed diffuse intra-osseal neoplastic infiltration of the corpora of the whole spinal column and extra-osseal propagation from the fifth thoracic vertebra into the spinal canal with spinal cord compression. Histological and immunohistochemical analysis of the extradural tumor, which was completely excised, disclosed nodular sclerosis Hodgkin's lymphoma with typical Reed-Sternberg cells that were positive for CD30, CD15, bcl-6, Ki67, p53, EBV LPM-1 and IgG, and negative for CD45, CD20, DBA44, kappa, lambda light chains and IgM. In addition, immunohistochemical analysis of the bone marrow in 1999 showed infiltration with positivity for IgM and negative for kappa light chains and IgG. These findings (expression of different immunoglobulins and light chains on the cells) suggest an independent origin of these 2 B-cell neoplasms.

To contribute to a better knowledge of the molecular mechanisms involved in such biological abnormality, the expression of the survivin gene was studied by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in the chronic phase of CML and at BC in 16 patients in whom sequential RNA samples from the 2 phases of the disease were available. Survivin was significantly overexpressed in both the chronic phase and BC as compared with granulocytes from controls. In BC, survivin expression was 7-fold higher than in the chronic phase, with such an increase being more pronounced in the myeloid (17-fold) than in the lymphoid cases (3-fold) (P = 0.03). Cell proliferation was significantly increased at BC, with Ki-67 expression being 2.8-fold higher than in the chronic phase. Despite the overexpression of both survivin and Ki-67 at BC, no significant correlation between their expression levels was observed. These data support a possible role for survivin overexpression in the pathogenesis of the progression of CML. However, further studies are required to elucidate the possible prognostic importance of such biological findings in this disease.","['0 (BIRC5 protein, human)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Survivin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, a clinicopathological study was performed on trephine biopsies in 575 patients with CMPDs focused on chronic idiopathic myelofibrosis (CIMF). A comparison with 25 healthy subjects revealed no significant differences in the numbers of HPCs (6 +/- 3/mm2) in polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia and advanced fibro-osteosclerotic stages of CIMF. Pre-fibrotic and early-stage CIMF displayed 16 +/- 11 precursors per mm2 BM. Sequential biopsies in this disorder showed a decline in HPCs (10 +/- 6/mm2) with evolving myelofibrosis-myeloid metaplasia (MMM), while in terminal stages acceleration generated an increase (24 +/- 25/mm2). A significant association between the quantity of HPCs and the development of myelofibrosis, splenomegaly, and anemia as well as an increase in peripheral blasts was recognizable in CIMF. Moreover, in all subtypes of CMPDs, a favorable prognosis was significantly associated with a higher number of HPCs in the BM. In conclusion, enhanced inflow of precursors from the BM with subsequent trapping, self-renewal and mobilization by the spleen is assumed to indicate a progressive generalization and worsening of the outcome.

However, potential inter-institutional variability among observers and immunohistochemical staining methods has not been fully addressed. We selected 21 cases of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) to process for TMAs. Immunohistochemical stains were performed in 3 laboratories, and reviewed independently by 3 hematopathologists at the 3 institutions. Stains were scored on a 4-point scale. Statistical analyses of variation in the scoring among observers and among different institutions' stains were performed. Stains for CD3, CD10, CD20, BCL-2, BCL-6, MIB-1, and FOX-P1 revealed little variation among observers, with an average 51-82% complete agreement and 82-100% agreement +/- 1 numerical score. The rate of concordance when evaluating most stains performed in different laboratories was also relatively good, with an average of 55-72% complete agreement and 70-97% agreement +/- 1 score. However, scoring of MUM-1 and p53 stains showed wider variation, with an average of only 37 and 30% complete agreement among observers, and 11 and 45% agreement when stains from different institutions were examined. Further statistical analyses were performed to compare the observers' scoring of their own institution's stains (self-review) vs. observers' scoring of other institutions' stains (non-self). The agreement rate for the p53 stain was significantly higher when based on self-review (average 58% complete agreement) compared with an agreement rate of only 10.5% when based on a review of stains performed in another laboratory, non-self review, P < 0.01. This difference in the self- vs. non-self review was not seen when data for MUM-1 were analysed. In conclusion, most phenotypic markers used in the analysis of DLBCL can be evaluated in TMAs with adequate agreement among observers and laboratories. These include CD3, CD20, CD10, BCL-2, BCL-6, MIB-1, and FOX-P1. However, some markers, such as p53 and MUM-1, are more prone to inter-institutional variation. Variations in interpretation can be partially overcome by self-adjusted/adapt tendency, as seen with p53. Especially with newly developed markers, such as MUM-1, the development of standardized techniques for staining and interpretation is critical to reduce inter-observer variability.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['Pathology Panel of the Lymphoma/Leukemia Molecular Profiling Project'],,,,,

The prognostic value that P-glycoprotein (Pgp), multidrug resistance-related protein 1 (MRP1), and lung resistance protein (LRP) have in the setting of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is controversial. In a retrospective study, we analyzed samples obtained from 295 similarly treated pediatric ALL patients to assess whether the overexpression and/or function of these proteins at diagnosis affects outcome. Most patients (70%, 207/295) did not overexpress an MDR protein. A small number of patients expressed functional Pgp (1%, 3/295) and some overexpressed functional MRP1 (10%, 19/295), with a statistically significant number of the latter being of T-lineage as opposed to pre-B (P < 0.001). A small number of patients (2%, 6/295) also overexpressed both Pgp and MRP1. Additional patients expressed increased levels of LRP. Elevated levels of these proteins at diagnosis did not correlate with risk factors and did not predict an adverse prognosis. Life-table estimates and Kaplan-Meier plots did not show any significant differences between patients who overexpressed an MDR protein compared with those who did not, nor was any difference noted when the different MDR + groups were compared with one another. These data strongly support the conclusion that the overexpression of these functional drug efflux pumps at diagnosis does not contribute to treatment failure in pediatric ALL.","['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Vault Ribonucleoprotein Particles)', '0 (major vault protein)', 'Y49M64GZ4Q (multidrug resistance-associated protein 1)']",,,,,['2 U10 CA 13539-31/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

NB4 cells as well as fresh leukemia cells obtained from APL patients in culture medium were treated with different concentrations of oridonin. Cell growth inhibition, apoptosis and related pathways were assessed by MTT assay as well as flow cytometry (FCM) and western blot analysis. The data revealed that oridonin (over 16 micromol/L) could inhibit the growth of NB4 cells by induction of apoptosis. Marked changes of cell apoptosis were observed very clearly by using electron microscopy and DNA fragmentation analysis after the cells exposed to oridonin for 48 h; Western blotting showed cleavage of the caspase-3 zymogen protein (32-kDa) with the appearance of its 20-kDa subunit as well as a cleaved 89-kDa fragment of 116-kDa PARP when apoptosis occurred. The expression of Bcl-2 was down-regulated remarkably accompanied by the disruption of the mitochondrial membrane potential (delta(psi)m). The anti-proliferative and apoptosis-inducing effects by oridonin in fresh APL cells were also found remarkably using Trypan Blue dye exclusion method and Wright's staining. We concluded that oridoning has significant anti-proliferative and apoptosis-inducing effects on NB4 cells by activation of caspase-3 and cleavage of PARP as well as by down regulation of Bcl-2 and disruption of the delta(psi)m. Furthermore, oridonin demonstrated apparent cell growth inhibition effects on fresh APL cells in vitro.

In T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), the co-culture of leukemic cells with stroma or the addition of particular cytokines prevents ex vivo spontaneous apoptosis. Interleukin-7 (IL-7), a cytokine produced by thymic and bone marrow stroma, increases the viability and proliferation of T-ALL cells. IL-7 induces the activation of Jak/STAT, MEK/Erk and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways in T-ALL cells. PI3K/Akt is the dominant pathway that mediates the effects of IL-7 on T-ALL. PI3K signaling is required for the induction of Bcl-2, the down-regulation of p27(kip1) and cell cycle progression. PI3K signaling is also required for the expression of the glucose transporter Glut1, uptake of glucose, activation of the metabolic machinery, increase in cell size, and maintenance of mitochondrial integrity.

HSPs induced by stress treatment have a role in the modulation of apoptosis. The reduction in protein expression levels was correlated with an increased susceptibility to drug-induced apoptosis. HSPs have also been implicated in the resistance of leukemia cells to potential therapeutic agents. The mechanisms of cellular protection used by HSPs have yet to be fully defined. HSPs were shown highly expressed by acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells as well as by acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells.

The clinical course is heterogeneous, some patients with aggressive form of the disease progressing rapidly with early death while others exhibit a more stable, possibly, non-progressing indolent type of the disease lasting many years. Despite progress in modern treatment modalities, relapse invariably occurs and disease still remains incurable. The clinical management of CLL is therefore challenging and considerable effort has been directed towards novel therapeutic strategies aimed at reducing minimal residual disease which can increase remission duration. Recent insight into the role of dendritic cells (DCs) as pivotal antigen presenting cells that initiate immune responses may provide the basis for generating more specific and effective immune responses. Ex-vivo modified and monocyte-derived DCs represents a promising approach within the context of CLL. However, understanding the relationship between DCs and the cellular immune response is crucial in devising strategies for manipulating immune responses. After a brief survey of general properties of DCs, this review focuses on the different approaches exploiting monocyte-derived DCs in CLL, which may help to design novel strategies for phase-I clinical trials.",,109,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The CDR3 of TCR Vbeta24 subfamily genes were analyzed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 17 cases with PML-RARalpha+ APL using RT-PCR and genescan technique. Ten normal individuals served as controls. The results showed that the number of expressed Vss subfamilies (from 2 to 21 subfamilies) varied in different patients with APL. The most frequently expressed Vss subfamilies were Vbeta2 (64.7%), Vbeta15 (58.8%), Vbeta3 and Vbeta5 (47.1%), with a lower expression rate found in Vbeta11 and Vbeta20 (11.7%). Clonally expanded T-cells in the Vss subfamilies could be identified in patients with APL in all but two of the cases studied, predominantly in Vbeta10, Vbeta23, Vbeta3 and Vbeta21.

Soluble vascular endothelial growth factor receptors 1,2 (Flt-1, KDR) are the negative counterpoint to the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling pathway, which has been characterized as one of the most important endothelial regulator in human angiogenesis. In the present work, we tested the differential prognostic relevance of soluble vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), their receptors 1 (Flt-1), 2 (KDR), and the ratio between sVEGF/sFlt-1 in 43 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). sVEGF and its soluble receptors were assessed using an ELISA. Soluble VEGF, sFLT-1 and sKDR concentration levels were significantly higher in AML patients at diagnosis when compared to the levels in normal controls. sVEGF, sFlt1 and the sVEGF/sFlt1 ratio were significantly higher in non responders when compared to responders (P < 0.001 for all). However, there was no significant difference regarding sKDR levels (P > 0.05). sVEGF, the sVEGF/sFlt1 ratio but not sFlt1 and sKDR levels were significantly elevated in those who did not survive, when compared to survivors. sVEGF, sFlt1 levels were significantly correlated to WBC counts (R = 0.93, P = 0.000, R = 0.56, P = 0.000, respectively); bone marrow blast cell counts (R = 0.92, P = 0.000; R = 56, P = 0.000, respectively); peripheral blood blast cell counts (R = 0.91, P = 0.000; R = 0.52, P = 0.000, respectively); sKDR was only correlated to peripheral blood blast cell counts(R=0.37,P=0.014). Cox regression analysis results with sVEGF, sFlt1, sKDR, sVEGF/sFlt1 ratio suggest that the most important predictor for AML outcome is the sVEGF/sFlt1 ratio.

Some other diseases such as uveitis, chronic thyroiditis, Sjogren syndrome, arthritis, acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome may be also associated with HTLV-I. Several case reports have suggested the possible combination of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) and HTLV-I infection. In these studies and from our current report, we found 17 patients (22.1%) with HTLV-I infection among 77 ITP patients. The prevalence of HTLV-I infection among ITP patients was higher than that of healthy volunteers (5 approximately 10%). The ITP patients with HTLV-I infection were older than the patients without HTLV-I infection, and the ITP patients with HTLV-I infection had poor response to prednisolone therapy. Among 17 ITP patients with HTLV-I infection, 9 patients received prednisolone therapy. Although most patients had transient increase of platelet counts, only two of them had partial responses (PR) at the last observation date. Five patients underwent splenectomy, and four of them had complete responses (CR) and the remaining patient had a (PR). Four patients received eradication of Helicobactor pylori (H. pylori) infection, and all patients had CRs. Therefore, the ITP patients with HTLV-I infection should receive eradication therapy in the case of H. pylori infection as the first step of therapy and the splenectomy should be considered, if there is no response to conventional therapy. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) causes thrombocytopenia in 10% of patients with active HIV disease. The etiologies of HIV thrombocytopenia are considered as follows, the escalated destruction of platelets by the immune system, damage to megakaryocytes by HIV infection and the inhibition of thrombopoiesis by some anti-viral drugs. In the case of ITP patients with HTLV-I infection, the main etiology may be the increased destruction of platelets by immune system. The proviral load and the integration pattern of HTLV-I should be examined to clarify the stage of HTLV-I infection. The possibility of infection of the megakaryocytes by HTLV-I should be also examined for etiological approach.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The patients' survival was analyzed by using the Kaplan-Meier method. Log-rank test was used to compare cumulative survival functions between different groups of patients. The parameters studied were: age, sex, Rai clinical stage, ECOG Performance status (PS), FAB morphological type, mediastinal lymphadenopathy, abdominal nodal mass, extranodal localization, absolute lymphocyte count, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, and response to therapy. RESULTS: The mean survival of patients was 76 months (95% Confidence Interval, 64-87). The following factors were found to carry significant prognostic value in relation to survival: Rai clinical stage, ECOG PS, mediastinal lymphadenopathy, extranodal localization, FAB morphological type and response to initial standard treatment.

In contrast to traditional staging systems, CD38 is able to identify progressive cases at an early stage. Measurement of CD38, in conjunction with other novel prognostic factors such as p53 and ZAP-70 helps to identify patients who might benefit from early and more intensive therapy. In addition, CD38 positivity can predict unmutated IgVH gene mutation status in most cases.

Among the most frequent agents of these phenomena are defects in the mitochondrial-mediated apoptotic pathway. This pathway is regulated by bcl-2 family of anti-apoptotic (bcl-2, bcl-xl, mcl-1) and pro-apoptotic proteins (bax, bad, bak). In particular, bcl-2 dimerizes with several members of bcl-2 family of proteins, altering the threshold of cell death. The flow cytometric quantitative measurement of bcl-2 and bax expression for the determination of bax/bcl-2 ratio provided crucial clinical information in AML: in our hands, lower bax/bcl-2 ratio conferred a very poor prognosis with decreased rates of complete remission (CR) and overall survival (OS). Moreover, striking correlations were found between lower bax/bcl-2 ratio and higher progenitor marker expression, such as CD34, CD117 and CD133 antigens, confirming the link between this apoptotic index and the maturation pathways. However, the capacity of bax/bcl-2 ratio to clearly identify patients with different prognosis with regard to CR and OS within the CD34+, CD117+ and CD133+ subgroups implies that other mechanisms, such as proliferation and/or cell cycle dysregulation may be involved to explain its clinical significance. Finally, small molecules that target both the receptor- and mitochondrial-mediated pathway of apoptosis are providing encouraging results in patients with relapsed and/or refractory disease (i.e. CDDOMe, bcl-2 antisense oligonucleotides, CEP-701, etc), confirming the key role of apoptotic mechanisms on the outcome of AML patients.","['0 (Mitochondrial Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)']",89,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The mRNA of cathepsin G is transiently expressed during the promyelocyte stage of neutrophil maturation. The protease plays several roles in inflammatory actions of neutrophils, such as bactericidal effects. A human cathepsin G gene fragment of 6 kb directs a promyelocyte-specific expression in transgenic mice, indicating the presence of necessary cis-acting elements. However, neither the precise architecture of the promoter, nor the trans-acting factors responsible for its activation, have been characterized. In the present work, 2.6 kb upstream of the translation start site of the human cathepsin G gene was cloned. When transfected to monoblast-like U937 or to acute promyelocytic leukemia NB4 cells, both expressing endogenous cathepsin G, the initial 360 bp upstream of the translation start were sufficient to direct a strong expression of a luciferase reporter gene. No expression was observed in erythroid K562 control cells. Further deletions revealed three major regulatory regions containing the consensus binding-sites for the transcription factors C/EBP, c-myb and PU.1. Moreover, a GC-rich region, similar to a cis-element in the proteinase 3 promoter, was identified. Direct binding of the trans-factors C/EBPalpha, C/EBPepsilon, c-myb and PU.1 to the promoter was shown by chromatin immunoprecipitation. The functional significance of the cis-elements was verified by site-directed mutagenesis. Mutations of the putative PU.1 site moderately decreased the activity of the promoter in monoblastic U937 cells, but not in promyelocytic NB4 cells. Separate mutations of the putative C/EBP binding site, c-myb-binding site or the GC-rich element resulted in a dramatically reduced transcriptional activity in both cell lines, suggesting cooperation between corresponding trans-factors.","['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (proto-oncogene protein Spi-1)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)', 'EC 3.4.- (Cathepsins)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Serine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.21.20 (CTSG protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.21.20 (Cathepsin G)', 'EC 3.4.21.20 (Ctsg protein, mouse)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, Dp3-Sam caused a time- and dose-dependent elevation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) level in HL-60 cells, and antioxidants such as N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) and catalase could effectively block Dp3-Sam-induced ROS generation, caspase-3 activity, and DNA fragmentation.

There are four known receptors in the EGFR family. Binding of a ligand such as epidermal growth factor (EGF) or transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-alpha) causes EGFR to undergo a conformational change leading to autophosphorylation of EGFR and activation of the EGFR growth factor pathway. The protein products of the genes that are then expressed increase cell proliferation and angiogenesis and inhibit programmed cell death. EGFR is expressed in 40% to 80% of NSCLC. EGFR tyrosine kinase activity can be inhibited by antibody therapy, such as cetuximab, against the extracellular domain of EGFR or small-molecule therapy, such as gefitinib or erlotinib that blocks the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding site of the cytoplasmic domain. Both forms of EGFR inhibition have single-agent antitumor activity against previously treated NSCLC. Interestingly, EGFR expression does not correlate with response to EGFR inhibition therapy. Increased likelihood of responding to small-molecule therapy is associated with female gender, never smoking, adenocarcinoma, and acquired mutations of the EGFR ATP binding site in tumor cells. In previously treated NSCLC, the small-molecule erlotinib improved both quality of life and median survival as a single agent compared with best supportive care. Southwest Oncology Group 0023 is a large, phase III, randomized trial comparing concurrent chemoradiotherapy and consolidation docetaxel with or without maintenance small-molecule therapy with gefitinib. There is also strong preclinical evidence that EGFR inhibition is additive or synergistic with radiotherapy in NSCLC. In locally advanced head and neck cancer, the addition of cetuximab antibody therapy to radiation increased median survival from 28 to 54 months. Cancer and Leukemia Group B 30106 and a multi-institutional Australian phase I trial have shown that gefitinib can be added to concurrent chemoradiotherapy for stage III NSCLC without excessive toxicity. A phase I trial at the University of Chicago (Chicago, IL) has evaluated erlotinib with concurrent chemoradiotherapy in stage III NSCLC.

The active inhibitor in the cell is its triphosphate form (5AZA-dCTP), which incorporates very readily into DNA to produce an inhibition of DNA methyltransferase. The mechanism responsible for the antileukemic action of 5AZA-CdR is related to its reversal of epigenetic silencing by aberrant DNA methylation of genes that suppress leukemiogenesis. 5AZA-CdR is an S-phase-specific agent. At concentrations in the range of micromolars this analogue can induce terminal differentiation and loss of clonogenicity of human leukemic cells. Drug resistance to 5AZA-CdR occurs primarily by reduction in deoxycytidine kinase activity or increase in the activity of cytidine deaminase, the enzyme that inactivates this analogue. 5AZA-CdR is a very potent antileukemic agent in animal models, more effective than the related antileukemic drug, cytosine arabinoside. In humans, 5AZA-CdR has a short half-life of 15 to 25 minutes due to rapid inactivation by liver cytidine deaminase. The major toxicity produced by 5AZA-CdR is myelosuppression. Preliminary clinical studies in patients with hematologic malignancies indicate that 5AZA-CdR is an active chemotherapeutic agent. The optimal dose-schedule for this interesting epigenetic agent with a novel mechanism of action remains to be determined. Translation of the pharmacology of 5AZA-CdR into therapeutic regimens based on scientific rationale can be used to obtain this objective.","['776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",67,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Promoter hypermethylation is the most extensively studied epigenetic process. Our expanding knowledge of this process has led to its application in the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of various hematologic and neoplastic diseases. Several agents, which reverse promoter methylation or inhibit histone deacetylases, are under development for use alone or in combination for a variety of neoplastic diseases.

Since AML is a disease primarily of the elderly, a large proportion of patients do not receive this therapy; therefore, novel treatment modalities are warranted. In addition, younger patients with poor-risk cytogenetics often have unsatisfactory results with conventional chemotherapy, so novel treatment options would represent a significant advancement in the management of this disease. The encouraging results of low-dose schedules of demethylating agents in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) have stimulated interest in the use of these agents in patients with AML. The DNA methylator phenotype of MDS and AML offers a biological rationale for treating these patients with doses of demethylating agents which act by reverting the hypermethylated state to an unmethylated state rather than by ""classic"" cytotoxicity mechanisms typically associated with higher doses. However, many issues surrounding this therapy need to be unravelled, including the role of different target genes that may become demethylated, and the potential use of combination therapy of hypomethylating agents with other drugs.

This compound was first synthesized over 40 years ago and since that time much information has been learned regarding its mechanism of action. It took nearly 20 years before the dual mechanism of action was elucidated. At high doses decitabine is cytotoxic, while lower doses are associated with demethylating activity. This information sparked further clinical trials using a lower dosing schedule since the original studies using higher doses were associated with significant myelosuppression and induction toxicity. Current trials using lower dosing schedules, particularly in patients with hematologic malignancies, have shown significant promise for the future use of demethylating agents. Sequential and/or randomized phase I/II studies have suggested that decitabine is most active when administered at relatively low doses given via a short infusion. The drug is less active and more toxic when administered via continuous infusion, and increasing dose-intensity resulted in a higher response rate, suggesting a relationship between peak drug levels and response. Even with all the information we have learned, there is still a need to determine the optimal dosing schedule and the development of alternative dosing forms.","['776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",35,,,,,,['Semin Hematol. 2005 Oct;42(4):274'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has been described that matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and especially MMP-9 is secreted by MM cells. In this study, we investigated the possibility to exploit MMP-9 activity to activate prodrugs and to target MM cells as a new tumour-specific therapy. Cleavage of the prodrug EV1-FITC by MMP-9 resulted in release of fluorescence which can be used as a measure of prodrug activation. The 5T33MM mouse model was used in this proof-of-principle study. The prodrug was activated in a higher amount by addition to MMP-9-producing 5T33MMvv cells, homogenates from tumour-bearing organs (BM, spleen) and isolated 5T33MM-diseased BM and spleen cells compared to non-MMP-9-producing 5T33MMvt cells and homogenates/cells from non-tumour-bearing organs/mice, as measured by fluorescence release. This fluorescence release could be inhibited by the MMP-2/MMP-9-specific inhibitor, CTT. Activation of the prodrug in the 5T33MM spleen and BM homogenates was confirmed by chromatography. EV1-fluorescein isothiocyanate injection into 5T33MM-diseased animals resulted in a higher fluorescence release by the isolated BM and spleen cells compared to injection into healthy animals. In conclusion, MMP-9 activity can be used to activate prodrugs that target MM.","['0', '(1-(3-(fluoresceinylthioureidoalanyl-alanyl-alanyl-L-leucyl-glycyl-L-norvalyl-L-p', 'rolylamino)propylamino)anthracene-9,10-dione)', '0 (Fluoresceins)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Prodrugs)', 'EC 3.4.24.35 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 9)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Coadministration of minimally toxic concentrations of SAHA (or sodium butyrate) and PD184352 (or U0126) resulted in a synergistic increase in mitochondrial damage, caspase activation, and apoptosis in K562 and LAMA 84 cells. Similar interactions were observed in CD34+ cells from two patients with CML and in imatinib mesylate-resistant K562 cells but not in normal human CD34+ bone marrow cells. These events were associated with a marked increase in ROS generation, inactivation of ERK and Akt, downregulation of p21CIP1, Bcr/Abl, and cyclin D1, and activation of JNK. Of these events, ROS generation, ERK inactivation, and cytochrome c/AIF release were largely caspase-independent, whereas the other phenomena displayed varying degrees of caspase-dependence. Using pharmacologic and genetic approaches, generation of ROS, p21CIP1 downregulation, and inactivation of Akt and MEK were found to play significant functional roles in SAHA/PD184352-mediated lethality, whereas JNK activation and Raf-1 downregulation were determined to represent secondary events. These findings indicate that interruption of the MEK/ERK pathway substantially lowers the threshold for HDAC inhibitor-mediated oxidative injury, mitochondrial dysfunction, and apoptosis, suggesting that this approach warrants further examination in Bcr/Abl+-related malignancies.","['0 (2-(2-chloro-4-iodophenylamino)-N-cyclopropylmethoxy-3,4-difluorobenzamide)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Butadienes)', '0 (Butyrates)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (U 0126)', '58IFB293JI (Vorinostat)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",,,,"['NIH Guide Grants Contracts. 2015 Dec 18;:NOT-OD-16-040.

To test this hypothesis, we genotyped 150 pediatric AML samples for mutations in KIT (exons 8, 17), NRAS and KRAS (exons 1, 2) and FLT3/ITD. This is the largest cohort of pediatric AML patients reported thus far screened for all four mutations. Of the children with AML, 40% had a mutation in KIT (11.3%), RAS (18%) or FLT3/ITD (11.1%), and 70% of cases of core-binding factor (CBF) leukemia were associated with a mutation of KIT or RAS. Mutations in RAS or FLT3/ITD were frequently found in association with a normal karyotype. Patients with a FLT3/ITD mutation had a significantly worse clinical outcome. However, the presence of a KIT or RAS mutation did not significantly influence clinical outcome. We demonstrate that KIT exon 8 mutations result in constitutive ligand-independent kinase activation that can be inhibited by clinically relevant concentrations of imatinib.

Of the three cardinal limb axes, the mechanisms that lead to establishment and patterning of skeletal elements along the P-D axis are the least understood. Here we identify a genetic interaction between Gli3 (GLI-Kruppel family member 3) and Plzf (promyelocytic leukaemia zinc finger, also known as Zbtb16 and Zfp145), which is required specifically at very early stages of limb development for all proximal cartilage condensations in the hindlimb (femur, tibia, fibula). Notably, distal condensations comprising the foot are relatively unperturbed in Gli3(-/-);Plzf(-/-) mouse embryos. We demonstrate that the cooperative activity of Gli3 and Plzf establishes the correct temporal and spatial distribution of chondrocyte progenitors in the proximal limb-bud independently of known P-D patterning markers and overall limb-bud size. Moreover, the limb defects in Gli3(-/-);Plzf(-/-) embryos correlate with the transient death of a specific subset of proximal mesenchymal cells that express bone morphogenetic protein receptor, type 1B (Bmpr1b) at the onset of limb development. These findings suggest that the development of proximal and distal skeletal elements is distinctly regulated early during limb-bud formation. The initial division of the vertebrate limb into two distinct molecular domains is consistent with fossil evidence indicating that the upper and lower extremities of the limb have different evolutionary origins.","['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Gli3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Zbtb16 protein, mouse)', '0 (Zinc Finger Protein Gli3)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two factors are responsible for this resistance: a defective XPR1 cell surface receptor for polytropic murine leukemia viruses (P-MLVs), and a resistance factor detectable only in interspecies hybrids between M. castaneus and mice with an XPR1 variant that permits infection by xenotropic MLVs (X-MLVs) as well as P-MLVs. This second novel virus resistance phenotype has been associated with expression of viral Env glycoprotein; Northern blotting with specific hybridization probes identified a spliced X-MLV env message unique to virus-resistant mice. These observations suggest that resistance is due to expression of one or more endogenous X-MLV envelope genes that interfere with infection by exogenous P-MLVs. M. castaneus contains multiple X-MLV proviruses, but serial backcrosses reduced this proviral content and permitted identification of a single proviral env sequence inherited with resistance. The resistance phenotype and the provirus were mapped to the same site on distal chromosome 18. The provirus was shown to be a full-length provirus highly homologous to previously described X-MLVs. Use of viral pseudotypes confirmed that this resistance gene, termed Rmcf2, prevents entry of P-MLVs. Rmcf2 resembles the virus resistance genes Fv4 and Rmcf in that it produces Env glycoprotein but fails to produce infectious virus; the proviruses associated with all three resistance genes have fatal defects. This type of provirus Env-mediated resistance represents an important defense mechanism in wild mouse populations exposed to endemic infections.","['0 (Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (Xenotropic and Polytropic Retrovirus Receptor)', '0 (Xpr1 protein, mouse)']",,,,,,PMC1181588,,,,,,,,,,['GENBANK/AY999005'],,,,

In addition to typical retroviral structural and enzymatic gene products, HTLV-1 encodes unique regulatory and accessory proteins, including a singly spliced pX open reading frame II (ORF II) product, p13(II). We have demonstrated that proviral clones of HTLV-1 which are mutated in pX ORF II fail to obtain typical proviral loads and antibody responses in a rabbit animal model. p13(II) localizes to mitochondria and reduces cell growth and tumorigenicity in mice, but its function in human lymphocytes remains undetermined. For this study, we analyzed the functional properties of Jurkat T cells expressing p13(II), using both transient and stable expression vectors. Our data indicate that p13(II)-expressing Jurkat T cells are sensitive to caspase-dependent, ceramide- and FasL-induced apoptosis. p13(II)-expressing Jurkat T cells also exhibited reduced proliferation when cultured at a high density. Furthermore, preincubation of the p13(II)-expressing cells with a farnesyl transferase inhibitor, which blocks the posttranslational modification of Ras, markedly reduced FasL-induced apoptosis, indicating the participation of the Ras pathway in p13(II)'s influence on lymphocyte survival. Our data are the first to demonstrate that p13(II) alters Ras-mediated apoptosis in T lymphocytes, and they reveal a potential mechanism by which HTLV-1 alters lymphocyte proliferation.","['0 (Retroviridae Proteins)', '0 (rof protein, Human T-lymphotropic virus 1)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)']",,,,,"['R03 TW005705/TW/FIC NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 RR014324-05/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA100730-069003/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 RR14324/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'TW05705/TW/FIC NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 RR014324/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA092009-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA100730/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA100730-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC1181595,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Though acute leukemias and bone marrow failure syndromes are usual causes of pancytopenia, etiologies such as infections and megaloblastic anemia also contribute. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinico-hematological profile of varying degrees of childhood cytopenias with special reference to the non-malignant presentations. This is a retrospective study carried out in a tertiary care children's hospital. We retrospectively analyzed 109 pediatric patients who presented with pancytopenia for different etiologies. Acute leukemia (including ALL, AML and myelodysplastic syndrome) and aplastic anemia accounted for 21 per cent and 20 per cent cases respectively. Megaloblastic anemia was found in 31 (28.4 per cent) patients and was single most common etiological factor. Severe thrombocytopenia (platelet < or = 20 x 10(9)/l) occurred in 25.2 per cent of these patients. Various skin and mucosal bleeding occurred in 45.1 per cent of patients with megaloblastic anemia. Infections accounted for 23 (21 per cent) patients who presented with pancytopenia. Amongst infections, enteric fever occurred in 30 per cent patients. Malaria, kala-azar and bacterial infections were other causes of pancytopenia at presentation.

Epub 2005 Jul 13.,"Arsenic, first among the top environmentally hazardous substances, is associated with skin, lung, liver, kidney, prostate, and bladder cancer. Arsenic is also a cardiovascular and a central nervous system toxicant, and it has genotoxic and immunotoxic effects. Paradoxically, arsenic trioxide is used successfully in the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia and multiple myeloma. Arsenic induces oxidative stress, and its toxicity is decreased by free thiols and increased by glutathione depletion. To further characterize the role of glutathione and oxidative stress in the toxicity of arsenic, we have used fetal fibroblasts from Gclm(-/-) mice, which lack the modifier subunit of glutamate-cysteine ligase, the rate-limiting enzyme in glutathione biosynthesis. Gclm(-/-) mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) are eight times more sensitive to arsenite-induced apoptotic death. Because of a dramatic decrease in glutathione levels, Gclm(-/-) MEFs have a high prooxidant status that is not significantly relieved by treatment with the phenolic antioxidant tBHQ; however, tBHQ blocks arsenite-induced apoptosis in both Gclm(+/+) and Gclm(-/-) cells, although it raises a significant antioxidant response only in Gclm(+/+) cells. Global gene expression profiles indicate that tBHQ is significantly effective in reversing arsenite-induced gene deregulation in Gclm(+/+) but not in Gclm(-/-) MEFs. This effect of tBHQ is evident in the expression of metalloproteases and chaperones, and in the expression of genes involved in DNA damage and repair, protein biosynthesis, cell growth and maintenance, apoptosis, and cell cycle regulation. These results suggest that regulation of glutathione levels by GCLM determines the sensitivity to arsenic-induced apoptosis by setting the overall ability of the cells to mount an effective antioxidant response.","['0 (Arsenites)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Hydroquinones)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Oxidants)', '0 (Tetrazolium Salts)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', 'C12674942B (2-tert-butylhydroquinone)', 'EC 6.3.2.2 (Glutamate-Cysteine Ligase)', 'EUY85H477I (thiazolyl blue)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'N5509X556J (arsenite)']",,20050713,,,"['R01 ES10807/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 ES010807/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'P42 ES04908/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'ES06096/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 ES07250/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2005 Jul 13.,"BACKGROUND: Aplidine (APL) is a marine depsipeptide isolated from the Mediterranean tunicate Aplidium albicans that is under clinical phase II development. In contrast to the lack of bone marrow toxicity reported in phase I/II studies, it has been shown to induce cytotoxicity at very low concentration against lymphoblastic leukemia blast, as well as having an impact in the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)/VEGF receptor 1 loop. PATIENTS AND METHODS: To confirm these findings we investigated APL-related VEGF inhibition and its cytotoxic effect on myeloid leukemic cells lines (K-562, HEL and HL60) and fresh leukemia blasts derived from 30 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The conventional active 4-demetoxi-daunorubicin (idarubicin; IDA) was included as a positive control. RESULTS: APL was found to be significantly (P<0.001) more active than IDA in obtaining 50% growth-inhibition in K-562, HEL and HL60 cell lines. Results obtained with AML blast cells were super imposible. ID(50) ranged from 0.024 to 0.610 microM for IDA (0.200+/-0.176) and from 0.001 to 0.108 microM for APL (0.020+/-0.031). Annexin V tests and cell cycle analysis performed on cell lines confirmed the stronger citotoxic capability of APL as apoptotic inducer and as a G(1) blocker. The inhibitory effects of APL on VEGF release and secretion have been confirmed by ELISA tests performed on HEL: the VEGF concentration in cell surnatant was reduced from 169 to 36 pg/ml after 24 h of exposure to a pharmacological concentration of APL. CONCLUSIONS: APL harbors a strong in vitro antileukemic activity at a concentration achievable in patients at non-myelotoxic doses. Our data also support the notion of an impact on VEGF secretion. Clinical studies with this new marine-derived compound in relapsed/resistant leukemia are underway.","['0 (Depsipeptides)', '0 (Peptides, Cyclic)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', 'Y76ID234HW (plitidepsin)']",,20050713,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We hypothesized that the relative proportion of TH1/TH2 directly relates to cardiac fibroblast (CF) function and thereby cardiac extracellular matrix (ECM) composition and cardiac diastolic function in the absence of injury or altered wall stress. We compared the effect of selective TH1 with TH2 inducers on cardiac gene expression, ECM composition, and diastolic function in C57BL/J mice. Twelve weeks after immune modulation, the left ventricular stiffness (beta) was significantly increased in the TH1 group and decreased in the TH2 group (P < 0.01). The TH2 group also demonstrated significantly increased end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes (P < 0.01). Cardiac gene expression patterns for pro-matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 and -13 were increased by greater than fivefold in the TH2 group and significantly decreased in the TH1 group (P < 0.05). The total cardiac collagen and cross-linked collagen were significantly increased in the TH1 group and decreased in the TH2 group (P < 0.01). Coculturing lymphocytes harvested from the treated mice with naive primary CF demonstrated a direct control of the lymphocytes on CF pro-collagen, pro-MMP gene expression, and MMP activity. These results suggest that the TH phenotype differentially affects diastolic function through modulating CF pro-collagen and pro-MMP gene expression, MMP activity, and cardiac collagen cross-linking, resulting in altered ECM composition. Thus modulation of TH lymphocyte function could promote adaptive remodeling in heart failure and postmyocardial infarction.","['0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Procollagen)', '0 (Protein Precursors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (Matrix Metalloproteinases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We analyzed 155 CLL tumors and found 12% with ATM mutations and 4% with TP53 mutations; 2 tumors contained mutations in both genes. Retrospective analysis on selected samples indicated that the ATM mutations were usually present at diagnosis. Compared with patients with wild-type ATM/TP53 genes, patients with ATM mutations had statistically significantly reduced overall and treatment-free survival. Although present in both IGVH mutation subgroups, ATM mutations were associated with unmutated IGVH genes and they provided independent prognostic information on multivariate analysis. Mutations in the ATM gene resulted in impaired in vitro DNA damage responses. Tumors with ATM mutations only partially correlated with tumors with loss of an ATM allele through an 11q deletion and, interestingly, those 11q-deleted tumors with a second wild-type ATM allele had a preserved DNA damage response. The majority of patients with ATM mutations were refractory to DNA damaging chemotherapeutic drugs and as such might benefit from therapies that bypass the ATM/p53 pathway.","['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (ATM protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",,20050712,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2005 Jul 12.,"Although TP53 mutations are rare in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), inactivation of wild-type p53 protein frequently occurs through overexpression of its negative regulator MDM2 (murine double minute 2). Recently, small-molecule antagonists of MDM2, Nutlins, have been developed that inhibit the p53-MDM2 interaction and activate p53 signaling. Here, we study the effects of p53 activation by Nutlin-3 in AML cells. Treatment with MDM2 inhibitor triggered several molecular events consistent with induction of apoptosis: loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, caspase activation, phosphatidylserine externalization, and DNA fragmentation. There was a positive correlation in primary AML samples with wild-type p53 between baseline MDM2 protein levels and apoptosis induced by MDM2 inhibition. No induction of apoptosis was observed in AML samples harboring mutant p53. Colony formation of AML progenitors was inhibited in a dose-dependent fashion, whereas normal CD34+ progenitor cells were less affected. Mechanistic studies suggested that Nutlin-induced apoptosis was mediated by both transcriptional activation of proapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins, and transcription-independent mitochondrial permeabilization resulting from mitochondrial p53 translocation. MDM2 inhibition synergistically enhanced cytotoxicity of cytosine arabinoside and doxorubicin in AML blasts but not in normal hematopoietic progenitor cells. p53 activation by targeting the p53-MDM2 interaction might offer a novel therapeutic strategy for AML that retain wild-type p53.","['0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '53IA0V845C (nutlin 3)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",,20050712,,,"['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA16 672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA49 639/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA55 164/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC1895324,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cranial radiation therapy (CRT) and chemotherapeutic agents, particularly methotrexate (MTX), are often suggested to be major contributing factors for its development. Homocysteinemia that arises as a result of MTX-induced folate depletion was proposed to play a role in MTX-related neurotoxicity. Several enzymes are essential to maintain the homocysteine levels. Their different functional forms, associated with common genetic polymorphisms, may modulate homocysteine levels and thereby influence MTX-associated neurotoxicity. OBJECTIVES: To test this hypothesis we assessed whether the variants of the methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), methionine synthase (MTR), methionine synthase reductase (MTRR), cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) and endothelial nitric acid synthase (eNOS, NOS3) genes, acting either independently or in conjunction with other risk factors, influenced the cognitive functioning in ALL patients. The influence of the genes was measured by estimating the change in IQ scores over a period of 4 years post ALL diagnosis. RESULTS: Two variants, the CBS 844ins68 polymorphism and NOS3 894T homozygosity, were associated with a change in IQ scores (p = 0.01 and 0.007, respectively). A multivariate model obtained through step-wise selection pointed to the importance of the NOS3 894TT genotype only. This effect appears to be dependent on CRT; IQ decline was apparent among individuals with the 894TT genotype who received radiation therapy (p = 0.03). Furthermore, additional factors affecting IQ were identified, including the treatment administered (i.e., CRT; p = 0.02) and a younger age at diagnosis (p = 0.003), and the modifying effect of the treatment protocols was also noted (p = 0.04). CONCLUSION: The results suggest that NOS3 genotyping might identify individuals that are susceptible to intellectual impairment following ALL treatment.","['0LVT1QZ0BA (Homocysteine)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (Nitric Oxide Synthase Type III)', 'EC 1.18.1.- (methionine synthase reductase)', 'EC 1.18.1.2 (Ferredoxin-NADP Reductase)', 'EC 1.5.1.20 (Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (NADPH2))', 'EC 2.1.1.13 (5-Methyltetrahydrofolate-Homocysteine S-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 4.2.1.22 (Cystathionine beta-Synthase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Under the transmission electron microscope (TEM), two kinds of leukemia cells' ultrastructure were observed. Flow cytometry combined with Annexin V-FITC/PI labeling was used to detect the pattern of K562 and HL60 cells' death induced by ALA-PDT. Flow cytometry combined with PI labeling was used to analyze the change in the cell cycle induced by ALA-PDT, and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) combining with calcium fluorescence probe was used to detect the change in the cytoplasmic free calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i). Immediately after irradiation, many typical apoptotic bodies were seen in the cells treated. Most of the cells treated were necrotic at 24 hours following irradiation. Flow cytometry analysis suggested that the main patterns of the cells' death were apoptosis immediately after irradiation and necrosis post-apoptosis at 24 hours post irradiation. Immediately and 24 hours after irradiation, the proportion of S phase of K562 was 57. 67% +/- 1.13% and 84.77% +/- 6.20% respectively, and the proportion of S phase of HL60 was 74.60% +/- 7.27% and 84.60% 1.74% respectively. Both [Ca+]i of the treated K562 and HL60 were increased obviously. In the best experiment condition, the initial pattern of the K562 and HL60 leukemia cells' death induced by PDT was apoptosis and the main pattern was necrosis post apoptosis. The two kinds of cells were arrested at S phase by ALA-PDT. During the death of the leukemia cells, the increase in intracellular free calcium concentration could be responsible for the ALA photodynamically induced damage to K562 and HL60 cells.","['88755TAZ87 (Aminolevulinic Acid)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SHP-2, through binding to the glycoprotein 130 signaling receptor, negatively regulates STAT3 activation. Growth hormone reduces disease activity and promotes mucosal healing in colitis and can activate SHP-2. METHODS: We hypothesized that growth hormone administration would reduce disease activity in experimental colitis and that this would involve modulation of SHP-2/glycoprotein 130 association and STAT3 activation. RESULTS: Growth hormone administration improved weight gain and colon histology in interleukin 10-null mice with colitis. Growth hormone reduced apoptosis and increased proliferation of crypt epithelial cells while increasing apoptosis of lamina propria mononuclear cells. Growth hormone increased SHP-2/glycoprotein 130 association and reduced colonic STAT3 activation in interleukin 10-null mice and in biopsy samples from patients with Crohn's colitis. Expression of the antiapoptotic protein bcl-2 was increased in crypt epithelial cells after growth hormone treatment. Growth hormone increased SHP-2/glycoprotein 130 binding and reduced interleukin 6-dependent STAT3 activation in the T84 human colon carcinoma and Jurkat human T-cell leukemia lines. CONCLUSIONS: Growth hormone administration improves weight gain and reduces disease activity in interleukin 10-null mice with colitis. The improvement in disease activity is associated with increased SHP-2/glycoprotein 130 binding and reduced STAT3 activation in both murine and Crohn's colitis. Growth hormone may be a useful therapy in inflammatory bowel disease, in terms of both improving anabolic metabolism and enhancing mucosal healing.","['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (IL6ST protein, human)', '0 (Il6st protein, mouse)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)', '67763-96-6 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor I)', '9002-72-6 (Growth Hormone)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPN11 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Ptpn11 protein, mouse)']",,,,,"['DK02700/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK63956/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Immediate DNR treatment led to enhanced DNR uptake and decreased viability in PKH67-labeled K562S, whereas no excess toxicity was seen if DNR treatment was delayed for 3 h. Treatment with vehicle control (Diluent C) gave similar results. In contrast, PKH67 labeling had no effect on K562S viability after vincristine treatment. For K562R, DNR uptake measured at 120 min was unaltered by prior exposure to PKH67 or vehicle, but viability was again significantly reduced after immediate DNR treatment. As with K562S, delaying DNR treatment for 3 h normalized viability in K562R. The excess DNR toxicity seen for PKH67-labeled K562S appears to be drug related, since it is not seen with vincristine, and may be due to the daunosamine sugar moiety present in DNR. However, with the addition of a 3-h incubation in fresh medium prior to drug exposure, PKH67 dye dilution can be used for proliferation monitoring of both K562S and K562R cells after treatment with DNR.","['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Organic Chemicals)', '0 (PKH67)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We synthesized CPL containing 3- to 13-mers by prolonged heating and rapidly mixing a carbohydrate compound of the L-lactic acid monomer (C(3)H(6)O(3)) under decreased pressure, and studied its effects on the growth of the cloned leukemic cell, TF-1. CPL inhibited the growth of TF-1 cells and induced 7A6 antigen, which is expressed by cells undergoing apoptosis, on the surface of TF-1 cells. In addition, caspase 3, 8 and 9 activities of TF-1 cells were increased after exposure to CPL, indicating that CPL induces apoptotic changes in TF-1. Among the 6 glycolytic enzymes examined in this study, the activities of PFK and HK, induced by CPL, decreased. Interestingly, CPL was detected in conditioned medium of the stromal cell line, LS801, obtained from human bone marrow. This conditioned medium inhibited the growth of TF-1 cells, and induced the expression of 7A6 antigen. These findings suggest that CPL will be a useful chemotherapeutic agent against leukemia.","['0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (Enzymes)', '0 (Lactates)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Polymers)', '0 (antigen 7A6)', '0 (cyclic polylactate)', 'EC 1.1.1.43 (Phosphogluconate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 1.1.1.49 (Glucosephosphate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (Hexokinase)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBSERVATIONS: Over the course of few weeks, her requirement for narcotic pain medications dramatically decreased. A contrast-enhanced CT scan obtained at 8 months after the procedure showed no evidence for local tumor recurrence.

A retrospective review was performed of 169 courses of HDAC administered to 57 patients (age 1.8-17.8 years). Procalcitonin values (PCT) were analyzed in a subgroup of 16 patients. Fever during HDAC occurred in 113 of 169 (67%) cases. C-reactive protein (CRP) was elevated in the febrile patients (median 38 mg/L [range 3-150]). PCT was elevated (>0.5 ng/mL) during HDAC in 4 of the 16 evaluated patients. Corticosteroids could inhibit fever (P < 0.001). Myelosuppression after HDAC was prominent: 99% developed neutropenia (<0.5 x 10/L) and 92% thrombocytopenia (<25 x 10/L). An early lymphopenia (median 0.1 x 10/L [range 0.01-0.68]) was seen during the first week. G-CSF was used after 12 of the 169 HDAC courses. A febrile episode occurred after 93 of the 169 (55%) HDAC courses, with no need for intensive care and no deaths. The incidence of viridans streptococcal septicemia was 2 of the 169 cases. Ara-C fever is common, and evaluation with inflammation markers is complicated by the fact that HDAC can induce a moderate release of both CRP and PCT. Profound neutropenia and lymphopenia are causative factors for the high incidence of infections, but the risk of life-threatening complications after HDAC in children in remission of lymphoid malignancies is low, even without prophylactic use of colony-stimulating factors.","['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '9007-41-4 (C-Reactive Protein)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An intense area of research is concerned with the identification of genes related to particular phenotypes. The technology, however, is subject to various sources of error that may lead to expression readings that are substantially different from the true transcript levels. Few methods for microarray data analysis have accounted for measurement error in a substantial way and that is the purpose of this investigation. We describe a Bayesian error-in-variable model for the analysis of microarray data from a clinical study of patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. We focus in particular on the problem of identifying genes whose expression patterns are associated with duration of remission. This is a question of great practical interest since relapse is a major concern in the treatment of this disease. We explore the effects of ignoring the uncertainty in the expression estimates on the selection and ranking of genes.","['0 (RNA, Messenger)']",,,,,"['CA66996/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA70101/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA74015/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA90301/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies were performed with the first irinotecan dose. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: In vitro synergy of irinotecan followed by Ara-C was confirmed in a human AML cell line as a basis for the clinical trial. Irinotecan was administered daily for 5 days, with Ara-C 1 g/m2 12 h after each irinotecan dose. Irinotecan was initiated at 5 mg/m2, and the dose was escalated by 5 mg/m2 increments in cohorts of three patients and in individual patients. Pre-treatment samples were studied for topo-I activity and serial samples after the first irinotecan dose were analyzed for pharmacokinetics and for pharmacodynamic effects, including DNA damage and DNA synthesis rate. RESULTS: The irinotecan dose reached 15 mg/m2 in three-patient cohorts without reaching the maximum tolerated dose, and reached 30 mg/m2 in individual patients. The AUC and Cmax of both irinotecan and its active metabolite SN38 increased linearly in proportion to dose, and the mean half-lives of irinotecan conversion to SN38 and SN38 elimination were 6.2 h (CV 171%) and 7.2 h (CV 48%). Irinotecan rapidly induced DNA damage, and DNA synthesis inhibition varied among patients and treatment cycles. All courses resulted in rapid cytoreduction, and two patients achieved complete remission. Topo-I activity did not predict response. CONCLUSION: Irinotecan can be safely administered with Ara-C. This combination is active in refractory AML and warrants further study.","['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '7673326042 (Irinotecan)', 'EC 5.99.1.2 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type I)', 'XT3Z54Z28A (Camptothecin)']",,20051105,,,"['CA 89938/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA16056/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2005 Jul 12.,"PURPOSE: Quantitative structure-activity studies were performed on a series of benzoquinone mustard (BM) bifunctional alkylating agents to determine whether DNA topoisomerase II (topo II) inhibition was responsible for cell growth inhibition. METHODS: Topo II inhibition was evaluated by decatenation and agarose gel electrophoresis assays. RESULTS: The BM compounds were shown to potently inhibit the decatenation activity of topo II. Though BM compounds promoted the formation of protein-DNA complexes in isolated nuclei and cells, this effect was undiminished when levels of topo II varied. The BM compounds had little activity in a topo II-mediated DNA cleavage assay, suggesting that they do not function as topo II poisons. Rather, BM-induced protein-DNA complex formation was likely due to the bifunctional alkylating reactivity of these compounds. Finally, the growth inhibitory properties of these compounds did not correlate with their ability to inhibit topo II, indicating that these compounds did not exert their cellular activity through inhibition of topo II. Some BM compounds reacted very quickly with glutathione and cysteine, likely initially through an electrophilic Michael addition. In the absence of cysteine, the growth inhibitory effects of BM were increased tenfold, indicating the modulatory effect of cysteine sulfhydryl adducts. EPR studies showed that a semiquinone-free radical was produced by some BM compounds. CONCLUSIONS: BM compounds likely exert their action through DNA cross-linking and/or by inducing oxidative stress. Although topo II is not a direct target of these agents, this enzyme may play a role in processing the consequences of direct DNA adduction and/or oxidative DNA damage.","['0 (Alkylating Agents)', '0 (Benzoquinones)', '0 (DNA Adducts)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '2158-76-1 (2-(bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino)-1,4-benzoquinone)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)']",,20050712,,,['CA90787/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To determine whether these functional differences were associated with differences in antigen-processing machinery (APM) component expression, we have measured the level of APM component expression in unmodified blasts and ALL-derived dendritic-like cells. Seven t(9;22) ALL patient samples and one cell line were studied for APM component expression utilizing a unique panel of recently developed monoclonal antibodies and a recently developed intracellular staining technique. In addition, the HLA class I antigen cell surface expression was measured. HLA class I antigens were similarly expressed on the unmodified blasts and on the autologous dendritic-like cells. Intracellular HLA class I antigen and tapasin expression (P=0.03 for both) were upregulated in all t(9;22) ALL-derived dendritic-like cells, in comparison to the unmodified blasts. These results provide a potential mechanism for the ability of t(9;22) ALL-derived dendritic-like cells to induce T-cell activation and, suggest that tapasin upregulation may serve as a marker to standardize and monitor the quality of the dendritic-like cells used in immunotherapy.","['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antiporters)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)', '0 (Membrane Transport Proteins)', '0 (tapasin)']",,20050712,,,"['CA 16056/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 67108/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PCE is listed as possibly carcinogenic to humans upon occupational exposure. Human exposure to PCE can produce oesophageal cancer, cervical cancer, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, urinary bladder cancer and leukemia. This work shows that PCE modulates the expression of some genes implicated in cancer induction, cell differentiation, cell-cycle progression, and the survival and clonogenic potential of human cord blood cells. After exposure to the compound, the modulated genes were involved in inflammatory responses as with the mitogen-activated protein kinase 14 (MPK 14), or in tumor and metastasis progression as with the matrix metalloproteinase 17 (MMP 17), in cell proliferation as with c-jun and c-fos, and moreover in the apoptotic process as with interferon alpha-inducible protein (IFI), BAX and BCL-2. Analysis of cord blood cells via flow cytometry showed that PCE treatment induced a statistically significant increase in necrosis after 24 h, while the clonogenicity of Human Colony-Forming Unit-Granulocyte/Macrophage (CFU-GM) and Burst-Forming Unit-Erythrocyte (BFU-E) progenitors did not change.

One of the primary mechanisms is the Fas (CD95)/Fas ligand system. Its inactivation in normal cells and malignant cells may be involved in malignant trans-formation and refractory clinical course, respectively. We established a Fas resistant clone and evaluated the molecular basis for its mechanism of resistance. The Fas-sensitive leukemia cell line, MML-1, was established from a child with B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia. A Fas resistant clone, MML-1R, was obtained by co-culture selection with anti-Fas antibody CH-11. Flow cytometry analysis showed both cell lines had equivalent expression of cell surface CD13, 15, 19, 22 and Fas receptor. Western blot analysis revealed equal expression of FADD (Fas-associated death domain protein), caspase-3 and -8. MML-1 was quite sensitive to both CH-11 and etoposide-induced apoptotis. By contrast, MML-1R had similar sensitivity to etoposide but no response to CH-11. Fas receptor mutation analysis showed a heterozygous death domain A --> G point mutation at 1009 bp, causing a switch from glutamine to glycine at amino acid 256. Immunoprecipitation assay showed decreased binding of Fas to FADD. We also found that etoposide bypassed Fas-FADD interaction in MML-1R by activating caspase-8 and caspase-3. These results indicate that Fas resistance can result from mutations of the gene encoding the Fas receptor which result in decreased FADD binding, thereby blocking formation of the death inducing signaling complex. Screening for similar Fas mutations in therapy resistant malignancies would lead to a better understanding of tumorigenesis and recurrence.","['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (FADD protein, human)', '0 (Fas-Associated Death Domain Protein)', '0 (Lewis X Antigen)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP8 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In approximately 70-80% of cases PCR amplified clonal rearrangements can be sequenced directly. The remaining 20-30% are rearranged on both alleles for the same target and disables direct sequencing. Here we describe a novel HPLC based method for identification and characterisation of TCR-gamma rearrangements either by a single or a multiplex PCR approach. The latter one amplifies several Vgamma segments in two distinct reactions either with a Jgamma1.3/2.3 or a Jgamma1.1/2.1 specific primer. The clonality status was evaluated on a high resolution micropellicular DNASep matrix (WAVE, Transgenomic) at different temperatures. From 331 samples analysed, 151 samples were positive for VgammaI-Jgamma1.3/2.3 including 51 biclonal rearrangements. For characterisation of these biclonal products or for products generated by multiplex-PCR, a second HPLC run was performed utilising a tandem arranged fraction collector. From clearly separated biclonal/biallelic products, several collected fractions were air-dried and afterwards sequenced directly with the appropriate Jgamma primer. We conclude from our results that HPLC is a fast and reliable method for identification of TCR-gamma rearrangements. The fraction collection simplifies the characterisation of single alleles within biclonal or biallelic rearrangements or within multiplex PCR products. The target identification process prior to routine MRD analysis will be shortened due to a simplified screening and sequencing strategy.","['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we applied flow cytometry, Western blot analysis and microarray techniques to investigate the effects of ATO on apoptosis and the cell division cycle of AMKL cell lines CHRF-288-11 and MEG-01. Our data demonstrated that ATO is a potent agent against AMKL as indicated by apoptotic markers, Annexin V and caspase-3. ATO activated the intrinsic (mitochondrial) pathway of apoptosis, which involved disrupting mitochondrial membrane potential, increased Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and caspase-9 activation, as well as the extrinsic (death receptor) pathway mediated by Fas and caspase-8 activation. We provided the first evidence that ATO stimulated expressions of CD137 mRNA and protein, which might be relevant to the extrinsic mechanism. ATO induced delays of cell cycle progression at S phase and arrest at G2/M phase of AMKL cells, but caspase-3 expression appeared not to be phase-specific.

In order to provide the molecular pharmacological mechanisms of PSP on human cancer cells, we investigated the gene expression profiles of PSP-treated apoptotic human promyelotic leukemic HL-60 cells using ResGen 40k IMAGE printed cDNA microarray. In total 378 and 111 transcripts were identified as differentially expressed in the apoptotic cells by at least a factor of 2 or 3, respectively. Our data show that PSP-induced apoptosis in HL-60 cells might be mediated by up-regulation of early transcription factors such as AP-1, EGR1, IER2 and IER5, and down-regulation of NF-kappaB transcription pathways. Other gene expression changes, including the increase of several apoptotic or anti-proliferation genes, such as GADD45A/B and TUSC2, and the decrease of a batch of phosphatase and kinase genes, may also provide further evidences in supporting the process of PSP induced apoptosis in cancer cells. Some of the well-characterized carcinogenesis-related gene transcripts such as SAT, DCT, Melan-A, uPA and cyclin E1 were also alternated by PSP in the HL-60 cells. These transcripts can be employed as markers for quality control of PSP products on functional levels.

Epub 2005 Jul 11.,"PURPOSE: This prospective phase II study evaluated toxicity, relapse rate, progression-free survival, and overall survival after allogeneic transplantation and conditioning with fludarabine, melphalan, and alemtuzumab in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-two consecutive adults with AML and MDS were enrolled onto the study. Median age was 52 years (range, 17 to 71 years) and the majority of patients had high-risk disease, comorbidities, and/or modest reduction in performance status. Fifty-six percent of patients had unrelated or mismatched related donors. RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 18 months (range, 2 to 34 months), 1-year survival was 48% (95% CI, 34% to 61%), progression-free survival was 38% (95% CI, 25% to 52%), relapse rate was 27% (95% CI, 15% to 40%), and treatment-related mortality was 33% (95% CI, 20% to 46%). The cumulative probability of extensive chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was only 18% (95% CI, 8% to 40%); extensive chronic GVHD was only observed in recipients of unrelated donor transplants. Performance score and disease status were the major predictors of outcome. High-risk disease (ie, active AML or MDS with > 5% blasts) or even modest decreases in performance status were associated with poor outcomes. Patients with standard-risk leukemia (first or second complete remission) or MDS (< 5% blasts) had excellent outcomes despite unfavorable disease characteristics. CONCLUSION: Fludarabine and melphalan combined with in vivo alemtuzumab is a promising transplantation regimen for patients with AML or MDS and low tumor burden. For patients with active disease, this regimen provides at best modest palliation. Despite a low incidence of GVHD, transplantation is still associated with considerable nonrelapse mortality in patients with decreased performance status.","['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '3A189DH42V (Alemtuzumab)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)', 'Q41OR9510P (Melphalan)']",,20050711,,,['CA 101337/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2005 Jul 11.,"TRPM7 is unique in being both an ion channel and a protein kinase. It conducts a large outward current at +100 mV but a small inward current at voltages ranging from -100 to -40 mV under physiological ionic conditions. Here we show that the small inward current of TRPM7 was dramatically enhanced by a decrease in extracellular pH, with an approximately 10-fold increase at pH 4.0 and 1-2-fold increase at pH 6.0. Several lines of evidence suggest that protons enhance TRPM7 inward currents by competing with Ca(2+) and Mg(2+) for binding sites, thereby releasing blockade of divalent cations on inward monovalent currents. First, extracellular protons significantly increased monovalent cation permeability. Second, higher proton concentrations were required to induce 50% of maximal increase in TRPM7 currents when the external Ca(2+) and Mg(2+) concentrations were increased. Third, the apparent affinity for Ca(2+) and Mg(2+) was significantly diminished at elevated external H(+) concentrations. Fourth, the anomalous-mole fraction behavior of H(+) permeation further suggests that protons compete with divalent cations for binding sites in the TRPM7 pore. Taken together, it appears that at physiological pH (7.4), Ca(2+) and Mg(2+) bind to TRPM7 and inhibit the monovalent cationic currents; whereas at high H(+) concentrations, the affinity of TRPM7 for Ca(2+) and Mg(2+) is decreased, thereby allowing monovalent cations to pass through TRPM7. Furthermore, we showed that the endogenous TRPM7-like current, which is known as Mg(2+)-inhibitable cation current (MIC) or Mg nucleotide-regulated metal ion current (MagNuM) in rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) cells was also significantly potentiated by acidic pH, suggesting that MIC/MagNuM is encoded by TRPM7. The pH sensitivity represents a novel feature of TRPM7 and implies that TRPM7 may play a role under acidic pathological conditions.","['0 (Cations, Monovalent)', '0 (Protons)', '0 (TRPM Cation Channels)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Trpm7 protein, mouse)', 'I38ZP9992A (Magnesium)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,20050711,,,"['R01 HL078960/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL078960-01A1/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL 078960-01A1/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2266571,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have previously shown that viral integration can lead to aberrant target gene transcription. In this study, we attempted to investigate common pathways to hepatocarcinogenesis. METHODS: By using a modified Alu-polymerase chain reaction approach, we analysed 50 HCCs along with 10 previously published cases. RESULTS: Sixty eight cellular flanking sequences (seven repetitive or unidentified sequences, 42 cellular genes, and 19 sequences potentially coding for unknown proteins) were obtained. Fifteen cancer related genes and 25 cellular genes were identified. HBV integration recurrently targeted the human telomerase reverse transcriptase gene (three cases) and genes belonging to distinct pathways: calcium signalling related genes, 60s ribosomal protein encoding genes, and platelet derived growth factor and mixed lineage leukaemia encoding genes. Two tumour suppressor genes and five genes involved in the control of apoptosis were also found at the integration site. The viral insertion site was distributed over all chromosomes except 13, X, and Y. CONCLUSIONS: In 61/68 (89.7%) cases, HBV DNA was integrated into cellular genes potentially providing cell growth advantage. Identification of recurrent viral integration sites into genes of the same family allows recognition of common cell signalling pathways activated in hepatocarcinogenesis.","['0 (DNA Transposable Elements)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Platelet-Derived Growth Factor)', '0 (Ribosomal Proteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)']",,,,,,PMC1774867,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is involved in the regulation of IL-12 and IL-10 expression in macrophages and stimulates the polarization of T cells to the Th1 subset. Three promoter polymorphisms of the human Eta-1 gene, -443T/C, -156delG/G, -66T/G, were investigated for possible influence on gene expression. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) with nuclear extract from the human myeloid leukaemia premonocyte cell line, THP-1, revealed sequence specific binding of the transcription factor Sp1 to the -66T allele but not the -66G allele, and haplotype -443C/-156G/-66T showed a marked increase in promoter activity of a luciferase reporter gene. Thus, a substitution of the T-base with G at position -66 in the Eta-1 promoter modulates the promoter activity of the Eta-1 gene, which might influence the Th1 versus Th2 balance. These observations are discussed in relation to a recently reported related observation on the same gene, and it is argued that discrepancies between reporter gene assays in the two studies may be due to the use of different cell lines and may reflect requirements for different transcription factors in cells involved in immune responses compared with other cells.","['0 (SPP1 protein, human)', '0 (Sialoglycoproteins)', '0 (Sp1 Transcription Factor)', '106441-73-0 (Osteopontin)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)']",,20050711,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['GENBANK/D14813'],,,,

METHODS: NB4 cells treated with 0.5 mg/L Tan IIA was regarded as positive control. After in vitro incubation of MR-2 cells with Tan IIA at the concentration of 1.0 mg/L for 4 days, the cell differentiation was observed by growth status, cytomorphology, and nitroblue tetrazolium test. Cell cycle, membrane cluster differentiation (CD) antigens (CD(33), CD(11b)) and expression of some oncogene (c-myc, c-fos, p53 and bcl-2) were analysed by flow cytometry. RESULTS: The growth of MR-2 and NB4 cells was inhibited after Tan IIA treatment, the inhibition rate were 73.5% and 67.7% respectively (P < 0.01, P < 0.01) without significant difference. After Tan IIA treatment, MR-2 and NB4 cells were induced to undergo morphological differentiation, which exhibited small cell bulk decreased nucleus/cytoplasm proportion, rough chromatin, disappearance of nucleolus and formation of azurophil granules and anomalous nucleus. MR-2 cells could be induced to metamyelocyte while NB4 could be induced to band form. NBT reduction of MR-2 and NB4 cells treated with Tan IIA showed that positive cells accounted for (95.30 +/- 0.76)% and (93.20 +/- 1.04)% respectively; but the positive rate of either group of the treated positive cells was significantly higher than that of untreated, being (3.50 +/- 1.32)% and (2.80 +/- 0.29)% respectively (P < 0.01). Flow cytometry showed that the expression of CD(33) was reduced, while that of CD(11b) was increased. The quantity of treated cells in G(0)/G(1) phase increased but that in S phase decreased. The proliferous index was also decreased. After treated with Tan IIA, the expressions of anti-oncogene p53 and c-fos were up-regulated while those of oncogene bcl-2 and c-myc were down-regulated (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: 1.0 mg/L Tan IIA could inhibit proliferation of MR-2 cells and induce differentiation of MR-2 cells into mature granulocyte, the effectivity was the same as 0.5 mg/L Tan IIA treated NB4 cells. Its possible molecular mechanism might be related to modulation of oncogene expressions associated proliferation and differentiation as well as inhibition of DNA synthesis. Tan IIA probably can be applied to treat the patients with APL, particularly to the relapsed and drug resistant patients with broad prospect.","['0 (Abietanes)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Phenanthrenes)', '03UUH3J385 (tanshinone)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Totally 173 patients diagnosed as MDS according to FAB or WHO criteria with complete clinical and cytogenetical data were included in this research. Among them 42 had +8 chromosome aberration, 16 had -7/7q-, and 55 had normal karyotypes and more than 0.10 blast cells in the bone marrow. Short term culture and G-banding techniques and in some specimens fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) method were used to do chromosome analysis. RESULTS: Among the detected chromosome aberrations, +8 was the most frequent (42.8%) and then -7/7q-(15.0%); 42 patients with +8 had median blast cell count of 0.08, within a median of 18 months follow-up period 40.0% of the patients evolved to frank leukemia (FL) and the median overall survival was 20 months. 16 patients with -7/7q- had higher blast cell count of 0.135; 43.8% of them developed into FL and the median overall survival was only 10 months within a 20-month follow-up period. 55 patients had normal karyotype but a median blast cell count of 0.148; 52.7% of them patients evolved to FL and the median overall survival was 34 months. CONCLUSIONS: Both the +8 and -7/7q- groups have malignant leukemic cell clone, and run a subacute and progressive clinical course; it is suggested they might be classified into Sub-AML.

PURPOSE: To evaluate the anti-fibrotic and anti-inflammatory effects of the AM matrix (AMM) on human conjunctival and lung fibroblasts in an in vitro system that tests fibrotic and inflammatory responses at the effector stages of allergic inflammation. METHODS: Human conjunctival or lung fibroblasts were seeded on plastic or on the stromal aspect of the AM, which was mounted on plastic inserts. Sonicates of human peripheral blood eosinophils activated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), or human mast cell (HMC-1) leukaemia cell sonicates, were added to sub-confluent fibroblast monolayers. Proliferation of the sub-confluent fibroblasts was assessed using the [3H]-thymidine incorporation assay. The production of transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and IL-8 in conjunctival or lung fibroblasts was measured in conditioned media from these cultures by ELISA. RESULTS: After 4 days in culture, the [3H]-thymidine incorporation assay indicated a reduced proliferation of activated conjunctival and lung fibroblasts when cultured directly on the AMM. The production of both TGF-beta1 and IL-8 was significantly suppressed in activated conjunctival fibroblasts cultured on the AMM compared with those cultured on plastic, while the production of both TGF-beta1 and GM-CSF was decreased in human lung fibroblast cultured on the AMM. CONCLUSIONS: The AMM is capable of suppressing fibrotic responses in an in vitro system of effector stages of ocular allergic inflammation. These data may provide a basis for exploring matrix components in the AM for the treatment of allergic eye disease.","['0 (Interleukin-8)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We evaluated the long-term outcome, risks for recurrent disease, and other hematologic complications following orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) for BCS. METHODS: Clinical data from 11 consecutive patients with BCS who underwent OLT were retrospectively reviewed. Four patients had a prior transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt and one had a surgical shunt procedure. All patients were started on intravenous heparin within the first 24 h following OLT. All except one patient who had protein C deficiency were maintained on long-term oral anticoagulation. RESULTS: The Kaplan-Meier survival rates at 1, 5 and 10 yr were 81, 65 and 65%, respectively. Three patients developed BCS recurrence, including two who died as a consequence of rapid graft failure within days after OLT. Three patients developed other thrombotic events, including splenic vein thrombosis associated with gastric variceal hemorrhage requiring splenectomy, portal vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. Four patients experienced severe bleeding complications within 7 d after OLT requiring exploratory laparotomy. One patient died after transformation of polycythemia vera to acute myelogenous leukemia at 2.1 yr after OLT.

JAK2 mediates signaling downstream of cytokine receptors after ligand-induced autophosphorylation of both receptor and enzyme. The main downstream effectors of JAK2 are a family of transcription factors known as signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) proteins. The myeloproliferative disorders (MPD), a subgroup of myeloid malignancies, are clonal stem cell diseases characterized by an expansion of morphologically mature granulocyte, erythroid, megakaryocyte, or monocyte lineage cells. Among the traditionally classified MPD, the disease-causing mutation has been delineated, thus far, for only chronic myeloid leukemia (ie, bcr/abl). In the past 3 months, 7 different studies have Independently described a close association between an activating JAK2 mutation (JAK2V617F) and the classic bcr/abi-negative MPD (ie, polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia, myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia) as well as the less frequent occurrence of the same mutation in both atypical MPD and the myelodysplastic syndrome. The particular finding is consistent with previous observations that have implicated the JAK/STAT signal transduction pathway in the pathogenesis of bcr/abl-negative MPD, Including the phenotype of growth factor independence and/or hypersensitivity.

In addition, eye abnormalities, such as strabismus, microphthalmia, or colobomas, ear abnormalities including cleft earlobe and preauricular tags, and urogenital defects are common features. Congenital heart defects, diaphragmatic hernia, abnormalities of the central nervous system, and skeletal anomalies have been reported but appear to be less frequent clinical manifestations.

To prevent secondary neoplasms, induce prolonged asparagine depletion, and maintain high event-free survival (EFS) in children with newly diagnosed T-ALL or higher-stage non-Hodgkins lymphoma (NHL), we designed this pilot study to determine feasibility and safety of substituting methotrexate/mercaptopurine for teniposide/cytarabine and PEG-asparaginase for native asparaginase. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty-five patients were entered, 29 with T-ALL and 16 with higher-stage NHL. Forty-two of 45 patients achieved complete remission (CR), and 27 completed the therapy in continuous CR. Treatment consisted of 4-week induction then 6 weeks consolidation and ten 9-week maintenance cycles. Therapy primarily comprised antimetabolites, anthracyclines, alkylating agents, and asparaginase. Expected chemotherapy duration was 100 weeks. RESULTS: Forty-two of 45 patients achieved CR, and 27 completed therapy. The most common toxicities were Grade 3 or 4 myelosuppression after cyclophosphamide/cytarabine and allergic reactions to asparaginase. Two died of sepsis early in maintenance. Five-year EFS was 68.5% (SE 9.1%) for T-ALL and 81.3% (SE 9.8%) for NHL. Five-year EFS was 73.1% (SE 6.8%) for the entire cohort. No patients treated entirely on this study developed secondary neoplasms. One patient taken off study for asparaginase toxicity was treated with multiagent therapy that contained teniposide, and died from secondary myelodysplasia (sMDS)/AML. CONCLUSION: Substituting methotrexate/mercaptopurine for teniposide/cytarabine and PEG-asparaginase for native asparaginase in a dose-intensive regimen was feasible in children and young adults with newly diagnosed T-ALL or higher-stage NHL. EFS was not compromised and secondary neoplasms were decreased.","['0 (Anthracyclines)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",,,,,"['5 U10 CA5312/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA29139/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ninety percent of SDS patients have mutations in SBDS on 7q11. Herein, we studied the role of genetic alterations in SBDS in AML. PROCEDURE: DNA was extracted from marrows of SDS patients with AML, as well as from children with de novo AML. Direct sequencing of PCR amplified genomic DNA was performed using specific primers flanking each exon. To study whether SBDS heterozygosity confers a risk for MDS/AML, data on family members of SDS patients on the Canadian Inherited Marrow Failure Registry (CIMFR) was analyzed. RESULTS: Of two SDS patients with SDS/AML one was homozygous 258 + 2T > C, and one was compound heterozygous 183-184TA > CT/258 + 2T > C. To determine whether a subset of patients with SDS can present with AML, we analyzed 48 AML samples at remission, but no mutations were identified. To address whether acquired mutated SBDS gene is associated with leukemic transformation in de novo AML, we analyzed 77 AML samples at diagnosis or relapse (4 with -7 and 7q-) for SBDS mutations; no alterations were detected. Also, among the relatives of an SDS patient cohort on the registry no cases of MDS/AML were reported. CONCLUSIONS: Common mutations occurred in our SDS patients who develop AML, and thus, AML is not confined to a rare genetic subgroup of SDS.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty three LTS, at least 10 years postdiagnosis, were administered a standardized psychometric instrument, the Quality of Life--Cancer Survivors, to assess multidimensional aspects of QOL. Social network characteristics were measured by items assessing social support satisfaction, use of supportive care services, network size, and reliance on formal and informal social ties. MAIN RESULTS: A hierarchical regression model explained 52.4% of the variance in QOL for the final model, including all important predictors. Social support satisfaction (beta=0.393, p=0.001) and the use of supportive care services (beta=-0.262, p=0.047) significantly predicted QOL after controlling for confounding variables. Social network structures (including network size and reliance on formal and informal social ties) were indirectly associated with QOL through the use of supportive care services. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that the use of supportive care services, satisfaction with social support, network size, and reliance on formal and informal social ties affect QOL for long-term cancer survivors. Enhancing cancer survivors' social networks may ultimately improve their QOL.",,,20050709,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Another group of cellular targets is represented by tumor-selective cell surface proteins that can serve as target structures for antibodies.

Many Wnt signaling genes are upregulated and activated in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Less is known concerning acute leukemia. One subtype of acute lymphoblastoid leukemia (ALL) is characterized by a t(1;19) chromosomal translocation resulting in a fusion protein E2A-Pbx1 that promotes transformation and leukemogenesis. Wnt16 has been shown to be targeted by E2A-Pbx1. We performed a differential gene expression array in acute leukemia cell lines displaying or not displaying the t(1;19) translocation. We found that Wnt16 and many Wnt signaling-related genes were upregulated in the translocation-containing cells. As two isoforms of Wnt16, Wnt16a and Wnt16b, have been recently identified, we demonstrated by using RT-PCR and Western blot that Wnt16b (and not Wnt16a) is overexpressed in t(1;19)-containing cell lines. We then directly addressed the role played by both isoforms in this type of leukemia. Using specific short interfering RNA (siRNA) and an anti-Wnt16 antibody, we showed that targeted-Wnt16b inhibition leads to apoptotic cell death. We also demonstrated that Wnt16b mediates its effect through the canonical Wnt pathway involving dishevelled-2, beta-catenin and survivin. We thus propose that Wnt16 plays an important role in leukemogenesis, raising its therapeutic interest.","['0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (WNT16 protein, human)', '0 (Wnt Proteins)']",,,,,"['R01 CA093708/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA093708-01A3/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we show that AML1-MTG16 blocks both myeloid differentiation and proliferation in the 32D/WT1-mouse myeloid cell line. These biological effects can be traced to the AML1 and MTG16 moieties of the fusion protein, respectively. Further, we show that AML1-MTG16 can induce epigenetic repressive changes at the histone and DNA level of the AML1 target gene Csf1r (c-fms), encoding the macrophage colony stimulating factor receptor. We observed that, concomitant with Csf1r downregulation, 32D/WT1 cells lost the ability to undergo myeloid differentiation in response to the granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF).

The EM-3 cell line, which represents an early myeloid progenitor cell line, showed growth arrest with Runx1 expression in the absence of any detectable changes in cell differentiation.

Each complex includes a single BRG1 or Brm molecule as the catalytic subunit. We previously reported that loss of Brm, but not BRG1, causes transcriptional gene silencing of murine leukemia virus-based retrovirus vectors. To understand the biological function and biogenesis of Brm protein, we examined seven cell lines derived from various human tumors that do not produce Brm protein. We show here that these Brm-deficient cell lines transcribe the Brm genes efficiently as detected by nuclear run-on transcription assay, whereas Brm mRNA and Brm hnRNA were undetectable by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis. These results indicate that expression of Brm is strongly and promptly suppressed at the post-transcriptional level, through processing and transport of the primary transcript or through stability of mature Brm mRNA. This suppression was attenuated by transient treatment of these cell lines with HDAC inhibitors probably through indirect mechanism. Importantly, all of the treated cells showed prolonged induction of Brm expression after the removal of HDAC inhibitors, and acquired the ability to maintain retroviral gene expression. These results indicate that these Brm-deficient human tumor cell lines carry a functional Brm gene. Treatment with HDAC inhibitors or introduction of exogenous Brm into Brm-deficient cell lines significantly reduced the oncogenic potential as assessed by colony-forming activity in soft agar or invasion into collagen gel, indicating that, like BRG1, Brm is involved in tumor suppression.","['0 (Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (SMARCA2 protein, human)', '0 (SMARCB1 Protein)', '0 (SMARCB1 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (SMARCA4 protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.4.- (DNA Helicases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For murine tumors, array CGH should provide even greater advantage, since murine chromosomes are more difficult to individually discern. We report here the adaptation and evaluation of a cDNA microarray-based CGH method for the routine characterization of CNAs in murine tumors, using mouse cDNA microarrays representing approximately 14,000 different genes, thereby providing an average mapping resolution of 109 kb. As a first application, we have characterized CNAs in a set of 10 primary and recurrent lymphomas derived from a Myc-induced murine lymphoma model. In primary lymphomas and more commonly in Myc-independent relapses, we identified a recurrent genomic DNA loss at chromosome 3G3-3H4, and recurrent amplifications at chromosome 3F2.1-3G3 and chromosome 15E1/E2-15F3, the boundaries of which we defined with high resolution. Further, by profiling gene expression using the same microarray platform, we identified within CNAs the relevant subset of candidate cancer genes displaying comparably altered expression, including Mcl1 (myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1), a highly expressed antiapoptotic gene residing within the chr 3 amplicon peak. CGH on mouse cDNA microarrays therefore represents a reliable method for the high-resolution characterization of CNAs in murine tumors, and a powerful approach for elucidating the molecular events in tumor development and progression in murine models.",,,,,,['CA97139/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, expression of cyclin A1 in patients with prostate cancer and a role of cyclin A1 in mediating expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were investigated. Cyclin A1 was highly expressed in aggressive tumors and was significantly correlated with VEGF expression in 96 patients with prostate cancer. Treatment of LNCaP cells with R1881, a synthetic androgen resulted in increased cyclin A1 expression. Induction of cyclin A1 expression in LNCaP cells led to an increase in VEGF expression and this effect was manifested upon the R1881 treatment. Cyclin A1 failed to mediate VEGF activation in DU-145 cells lacking a functional Rb and an androgen receptor (AR). Although AR expression was induced into DU-145 cells, cyclin A1 was unable to mediate VEGF expression. However, induced coexpression of cyclin A1, Rb and AR in DU-145 cells in the presence of R1881 greatly promoted VEGF promoter activity. This suggests that cyclin A1 mediates VEGF expression in cooperation with Rb- and androgen-dependent pathways in prostate cancer.","['0 (Androgens)', '0 (CCNA1 protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin A)', '0 (Cyclin A1)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '2C323EGI97 (Metribolone)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The amounts of Bcr-Abl mRNA and protein in cells from patients in blast crisis (BC) are higher than in those chronic phase (CP), indicating that their expression rises with disease progression. In order to study this phenomenon on cells with the same genetic background, we transfected the 32D cell line with the BCR-ABL transgene and selected clones with graded expression of Bcr-Abl within the range found in cells from CP to BC. In vitro, we found that Bcr-Abl exerted dose-dependent effects upon growth factor dependence, clonogenicity and migration. However, the relationship between Bcr-Abl expression and cellular adhesion to fibronectin was more complex: rather than a direct positive correlation, clones that expressed low, but not high, levels of Bcr-Abl were less adhesive than growth factor stimulated, parental BCR-ABL-negative 32D cells. This finding parallels the situation with normal and CML-CP progenitors where the latter exhibit defective adhesion to fibronectin. Treatment with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate reversed the adhesion deficient phenotype of clones expressing low levels of Bcr-Abl. When injected subcutaneously into syngeneic mice, cell lines expressing high levels of Bcr-Abl rapidly induced tumors, whereas low-expressing clones led to tumor formation only after a prolonged latency. These findings suggest that the level of Bcr-Abl may be essential in determining the phenotype of the leukemic clone at different stages of the disease.","['0 (RNA, Messenger)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using a novel bioinformatic tool that alternates between clustering and standard statistical methods of analysis, we performed a 'double-blind' search of published gene expression data of subjects with different childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) subtypes, looking for unanticipated partitions of patients, induced by unexpected groups of genes with correlated expression. We discovered a group of about 30 genes, related to the interferon response pathway, whose expression levels divide the ALL samples into two subgroups; high in 50, low in 285 patients. Leukemic subclasses prevalent in early childhood (the age most susceptible to infection) are over-represented in the high-expression subgroup. Similar partitions, induced by the same genes, were found also in breast and ovarian cancer but not in lung cancer, prostate cancer and lymphoma. About 40% of breast cancer samples expressed the 'interferon-related' signature. It is of interest that several studies demonstrated mouse mammary tumor virus-like sequences in about 40% of breast cancer samples. Our discovery of an unanticipated strong signature of an interferon-induced pathway provides molecular support for a role for either inflammation or viral infection in the pathogenesis of childhood leukemia as well as breast and ovarian cancer.","['0 (DNA Primers)', '9008-11-1 (Interferons)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The cleavage of Mcl-1 was accompanied by the activation of caspases-3, -9, and -8. The broad-specificity caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk completely blocked Mcl-1 cleavage induced by PDT, STS or UVC, providing evidence for Mcl-1 as a substrate for caspases. Western blot analysis localized Mcl-1 to mitochondria, ER, and cytosol of both MCF-7c3 and U937 cells, suggesting that Mcl-1 protein, unlike Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, is not a target for Pc 4-PDT, probably due to its localization to sites removed from those of Pc 4 binding. The 28-kDa cleaved fragment of Mcl-1, which has proapoptotic activity, was produced in PDT-treated lymphoid-derived cells, but not in cells of epithelial origin, suggesting that PDT-induced rapid and extensive apoptosis in lymphoma cells may result in part from the sensitivity of their Mcl-1 to caspase cleavage, removing an important negative control on apoptosis.","['0 (Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Photosensitizing Agents)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (phthalocyanine Pc 4)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)']",,,,,"['P01 CA48735/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA43703/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA83917/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The p63 gene has two distinct promoters, coding for proteins containing an N-terminal transactivation domain (TA isoforms) and for proteins lacking this region (DeltaN isoforms). The full-length transcriptionally active TAp63 isoforms are capable of transactivating the majority of the p53 target promoters thus inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. On the contrary, the DeltaNp63 isoforms seem to counteract the transactivation activities of p53 and TAp63 proteins, thus possibly conferring a proliferative advantage to cancer cells. However, the molecular mechanisms controlling the transcriptional activity of p63 remain largely unclear. Here we present data indicating that (i) the promyelocytic leukaemia protein (PML) physically interacts with p63, (ii) p63 is localized into the PML nuclear-bodies (PML-NBs) in vivo, and (iii) PML regulates p63 transcriptional activity. We show that the interaction of p63 with PML increases the levels of p63 in cultured cells as well as its ability to transactivate the p53-responsive elements of the GADD45, p21 and bax promoters. These data are consistent with a general role for PML as a functional modulator of all the p53 family members.

Here, we address a potential role of death receptor signaling through the FADD/caspase-8 death-inducing signaling complex in As2O3-induced cell death. In detail, we demonstrate that As2O3 induces cell death independently of caspase-8 or FADD and cannot be blocked by disruption of CD95/Fas receptor ligand interaction.

Nevertheless, As2O3-induced cell death occurred in a regulated manner and was abrogated upon Bcl-2 overexpression. In contrast, As2O3-induced cell demise was neither blocked by the caspase-9 inhibitor z-LEHD-fmk nor substantially inhibited through the expression of a dominant negative caspase-9 mutant.

Here we reported that myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1), an anti-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family with a rapid turnover rate, interacts with Puma. The Puma/Mcl-1 interaction was verified by both yeast two-hybrid assay and co-immuno-precipation studies. Their binding sites were mapped to BH3 (Bcl-2 homology) domain of Puma and BH1 domain of Mcl-1, respectively. Mcl-1 and Puma was shown to colocalize at the mitochondria by immunostaining. The level of Mcl-1 was increased when coexpressed with Puma, indicating Puma is able to stabilize Mcl-1. Puma binding to Mcl-1 via its BH3 domain is the prerequisite for this effect, which is further supported by the finding that Puma mutant lacking BH3 domain no longer promotes Mcl-1 protein stability. This Puma-enhanced Mcl-1 stabilization was validated in vivo under non-overexpression conditions. We also showed that BH1 domain is essential for Mcl-1 to inhibit Puma-induced apoptosis, since Mcl-1 mutant lacking BH1 domain completely abrogates its protective function. In addition, we concluded that binding of Puma to BH1 domain of Mcl-1 is necessary, but not sufficient to prevent rapid degradation of Mcl-1. In addition to PEST (proline, glutamic acid, serine, and threonine) and BH1 domain, some additional degradation signal is expected to reside in the C-terminal region of Mcl-1. In conclusion, our results provide the first evidence that the interaction between Mcl-1 and Puma may represent a novel mechanism by which Mcl-1 prevents apoptosis by increasing its stability through binding to Puma.","['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BBC3 protein, human)', '0 (Cytochrome c Group)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Organic Chemicals)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Rhodamines)', '0 (red dye CMXRos)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",,,"['Oncogene (2005) 24, 7224-7237. doi:10.1038/sj.onc.1208873; published online 27', 'June 2005.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Somewhat paradoxically, ectopic expression of activated N-ras in primary hematopoietic cells and myeloid cell lines (in some cases) can lead to inhibition of proliferation. Expression of mutant N-ras in murine hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells is sufficient to induce myeloid malignancies, but these pathologies occur with long latency. This suggests that mutations that disable the growth suppressive properties of N-ras in hematopoietic cells are required for the development of frank malignancy. In the present work, the growth suppression induced by a mutant N-ras gene in U937 myeloid cells was used as the basis to screen a retroviral cDNA library for genes that prevent mutant N-ras-induced growth suppression (i.e., putative cooperating oncogenes). This screen identified the gene for the transcription factor interferon regulatory factor-2 (IRF-2), and as confirmation of the screen, overexpression of this gene in U937 cells was shown to inhibit mutant N-ras-induced growth suppression. Also recovered from the screen were two truncated clones of an uncharacterized gene (interim official symbol: PP2135). Overexpression of this truncated PP2135 gene in U937 cells did not appear to abrogate mutant N-ras-induced growth suppression, but rather appeared to confer an increased sensitivity of U937 cells to retroviral infection, accounting for the recovery of this gene from the genetic screen.","['0 (IRF2 protein, human)', '0 (Interferon Regulatory Factor-2)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Surprisingly, inhibition of PI3 kinase (PI3K) activity, which in turn inhibited AKT activation, significantly increased the DNA-binding activity of Stat3 in U87 and D54 cells. This was not due to an increase in the level of tyrosine-phosphorylated Stat3. Conversely, ectopic expression of constitutively activated AKT significantly decreased the DNA-binding activity of Stat3 in 293T cells. Interestingly, blockade of protein phosphatase 2A activity in GBM or 293T cells by calyculin A, which activated AKT, stabilized the phosphorylation of multiple Ser/Thr residues that were located in the transactivation domain (TAD) of Stat3 and this in turn completely ablated the DNA-binding activity of Stat3.

We previously demonstrated that expression of ferritin heavy chain (ferritin H) was induced by pro-oxidants, which is a part of cellular antioxidant response to protect cells from oxidative damage. In this study, we have identified that the antioxidant/electrophile response element (ARE) located 4.5 kb upstream to the human ferritin H transcription initiation site is responsible for the oxidant response. The human ferritin H ARE comprises two copies of bidirectional AP1 motifs. Mutations in each AP1 motif significantly impaired protein binding and the function of the ARE, indicating that both of the AP1 motifs are required for pro-oxidant-mediated activation of the ferritin H gene. We identified that JunD, an AP1 family basic-leucine zipper (bZip) transcription factor, is one of the ferritin H ARE binding proteins and activates ferritin H transcription in HepG2 hepatocarcinoma cells. Gel retardation assay demonstrated that H2O2 (hydrogen peroxide) or t-BHQ (tert-butylhydroquinone) treatment increased total protein binding as well as JunD binding to the ferritin H ARE. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay showed that H2O2 treatment induced JunD binding to the ferritin H ARE. Both H2O2 and t-BHQ induced phosphorylation of JunD at Ser-100, an activated form of JunD. Furthermore, overexpression of JunD induced endogenous ferritin H protein synthesis. Since JunD has recently been demonstrated to protect cells from several stress stimuli including oxidative stress, these results suggest that, in addition to NFE2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) as a major ARE regulatory protein, JunD is another ARE regulatory protein for transcriptional activation of the human ferritin H gene and probably other antioxidant genes containing the conserved ARE sequences by which JunD may confer cytoprotection during oxidative stress.","['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-1)', '9007-73-2 (Ferritins)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)']",,,,,"['R01 DK060007/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK060007-01A1/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK060007-02/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK-60007/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2365508,,,['NIHMS44504'],,,,,,,,,,,

Sixteen genes induced in NIH 3T3 cells by wild type EVI1-VP16 but not by mutant forms were identified. Sequence analysis revealed evolutionarily conserved GACAAGATA-like motifs within 10 kb of their transcription start sites, and by chromatin immunoprecipitation in fibroblasts, we showed occupancy of many of these sites by EVI1-VP16. To assess whether native EVI1 binds to these sites in EVI1-transformed myeloid cells, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation in 32Dcl3 and NFS58 cells, using anti-EVI1 antisera, and we showed that the majority of these sites is bound by wild type EVI1. These putative target genes include Gadd45g, Gata2, Zfpm2/Fog2, Skil (SnoN), Klf5 (BTEB2), Dcn, and Map3k14 (Nik). In this study we demonstrated for the first time that the N-terminal DNA binding domain of EVI1 has the capacity to bind to endogenous genes. We hypothesized that these genes play a critical role in EVI1-induced transformation.","['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Herpes Simplex Virus Protein Vmw65)', '0 (MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein)', '0 (MECOM protein, human)', '0 (Mecom protein, mouse)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",,20050708,,,['R01 81216/PHS HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2005 Jul 8.,"Imatinib mesylate (GLEEVEC, GLIVEC, formerly STI571) has demonstrated unprecedented efficacy as first-line therapy for treatment for all phases of chronic myelogenous leukemia and metastatic and unresectable malignant gastrointestinal stromal tumors. Disposition and biotransformation of imatinib were studied in four male healthy volunteers after a single oral dose of 239 mg of (14)C-labeled imatinib mesylate. Biological fluids were analyzed for total radioactivity, imatinib, and its main metabolite CGP74588. Metabolite patterns were determined by radio-high-performance liquid chromatography with off-line microplate solid scintillation counting and characterized by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Imatinib treatment was well tolerated without serious adverse events. Absorption was rapid (t(max) 1-2 h) and complete with imatinib as the major radioactive compound in plasma. Maximum plasma concentrations were 0.921 +/- 0.095 mug/ml (mean +/- S.D., n = 4) for imatinib and 0.115 +/- 0.026 mug/ml for the pharmacologically active N-desmethyl metabolite (CGP74588). Mean plasma terminal elimination half-lives were 13.5 +/- 0.9 h for imatinib, 20.6 +/- 1.7 h for CGP74588, and 57.3 +/- 12.5 h for (14)C radioactivity. Imatinib was predominantly cleared through oxidative metabolism. Approximately 65 and 9% of total systemic exposure [AUC(0-24 h) (area under the concentration time curve) of radioactivity] corresponded to imatinib and CGP74588, respectively. The remaining proportion corresponded mainly to oxidized derivatives of imatinib and CGP74588. Imatinib and its metabolites were excreted predominantly via the biliary-fecal route. Excretion of radioactivity was slow with a mean radiocarbon recovery of 80% within 7 days (67% in feces, 13% in urine). Approximately 28 and 13% of the dose in the excreta corresponded to imatinib and CGP74588, respectively.","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (CGP 74588)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6)']",,20050708,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2005 Jul 8.,"Leukemogenic viruses like human T-lymphotropic virus and bovine leukemia virus (BLV) presumably persist in the host partly by latent integration of the provirus in a fraction of infected cells, leading to accumulative increase in the outgrowth of transformed cells. Furthermore, viral infection also correlates with a blockade of the apoptotic mechanisms concomitant with an apparent latency of the host cell. Conceptually, induction of viral or cellular gene expression could thus also be used as a therapeutic strategy against retroviral-associated leukemia. Here, we provide evidence that valproate, an inhibitor of deacetylases, activates BLV gene expression in transient transfection experiments and in short-term cultures of primary B-lymphocytes. In vivo, valproate injection into newly BLV-inoculated sheep did not abrogate primary infection. However, valproate treatment, in the absence of any other cytotoxic drug, was efficient for leukemia/lymphoma therapy in the sheep model leading to decreased lymphocyte numbers (respectively from 25.6, 35.7, and 46.5 x 10(3) cells per mm3 to 1.0, 10.6, and 24.3 x 10(3) cells per mm3 in three leukemic sheep) and tumor regression (from >700 cm3 to undetectable).

Epub 2005 Jul 8.,"The assembly of the primordial follicles early in ovarian development and the subsequent development and transition of the primordial follicle to the primary follicle are critical processes in ovarian biology. These processes directly affect the number of oocytes available to a female throughout her reproductive life. Once the pool of primordial follicles is depleted a series of physiological changes known as menopause occur. The inappropriate coordination of these processes contributes to ovarian pathologies such as premature ovarian failure (POF) and infertility. Primordial follicle assembly and development are coordinated by locally produced paracrine and autocrine growth factors. Endocrine factors such as progesterone have also been identified that influence follicular assembly. Locally produced factors that promote the primordial to primary follicle transition include growth factors such as kit ligand (KL), leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF), bone morphogenic proteins (BMP's), keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF). Factors mediating both precursor theca-granulosa cell interactions and granulosa-oocyte interactions have been identified. A factor produced by preantral and antral follicles, Mullerian inhibitory substance, can act to inhibit the primordial to primary follicle transition. Observations suggest that a complex network of cell-cell interactions is required to control the primordial to primary follicle transition. Elucidation of the molecular and cellular control of primordial follicle assembly and the primordial to primary follicle transition provides therapeutic targets to regulate ovarian function and treat ovarian disease.","['0 (Bone Morphogenetic Proteins)', '0 (FGF7 protein, human)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '0 (Testicular Hormones)', '103107-01-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 2)', '126469-10-1 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 7)', '62031-54-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factors)', '80497-65-0 (Anti-Mullerian Hormone)']",168,20050708,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The most active, aqueous extract was subsequently subjected to a detailed investigation in a panel of 17 tumor cell lines, showing an average IC50 of 49 mg raw powder/ml medium. The sensitivity of the cell lines varied by two orders of magnitude, from 1.7 mg/ml in MCF7 breast cancer cells to 170 mg/ml in AR230 chronic-myeloid leukemia cells. Immortalized, non-tumorigenic cell lines showed a marginal sensitivity. In addition, kinetic and recovery experiments performed in MCF7 and U87-MG cells and a comparison with the antineoplastic activity of miltefosine, gemcitabine, and cisplatinum in MCF7, U87-MG, HEp2, and SAOS2 cells revealed no obvious similarity between the sensitivity profiles of the extract and the three standard agents, suggesting a different mechanism of cytotoxicity. The in vivo antitumor activity was determined in the CC531 colorectal cancer rat model. Significant anticancer activity was found following administration of equitoxic doses of 100 (perorally) and 5 (intraperitoneally) mg raw powder/kg, indicating a 95% reduced activity following intestinal absorption. By sequencing the mitochondrial gene for the large subunit of the ribulose bis-phosphate carboxylase (rbcL) in DNA from the plant material, the source plant was identified as Ximenia americana. A physicochemical characterization showed that the active antineoplastic component(s) of the plant material are proteins with galactose affinity. Moreover, by mass spectrometry, one of these proteins was shown to contain a stretch of 11 amino acids identical to a tryptic peptide from the ribosome-inactivating protein ricin.","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '059QF0KO0R (Water)']",,20050711,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2005 Apr 19.,"The prognostic significance of selected markers of leukemic cells is well known. CD7 and CD56 expression at diagnosis has been associated with low remission rates and biological aggressiveness in a significant proportion of acute leukemias. Among 46 patients with acute myeloid leukemia, we found CD7 expression in 15 cases (32.6%) and CD56 positivity in 10 patients (21.7%). Six of these myeloid leukemia cases (13%) showed expression of both CD7 and CD56. Four of 46 (8.7%) patients expressed CD79a. Among the 10 that were acute myeloblastic leukemia, 8 expressed CD7, 4 expressed CD56, and 4 were positive for CD79a. Thus, these markers were expressed early in hemopoietic ontogeny in the lesser-differentiated acute myeloid leukemia subtypes, including FAB M0, M1, and M2. Whereas CD7 and CD56 were each positive in 4 cases of acute myelomonocytic leukemia (FAB M4 subtype), there was no CD79a expression in the M4 cases. CD7 is expressed by mature T cells, NK cells, and an immature myeloid cell subset. NK cells and a T cell subset express CD56. By contrast, CD79a is a B cell marker that is assigned a high score of 2.0 in the differentiation of acute leukemias of ambiguous lineage in the WHO classification. The aberrant expression of CD7, CD56, and CD79a, representing the capacity of these leukemias for trilineal expression of leukocyte differentiation antigens, portends a poor prognosis.","['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD7)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CD56 Antigen)', '0 (CD79 Antigens)', '0 (CD79A protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)']",,20050419,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2005 Jul 7.,"This scientific review was prompted by recent legislation to curtail the use of semen from potentially virus-infected bulls to produce embryos for import into the European Union. From studies in laboratory animals, humans and horses, it is apparent that viruses may sometimes attach to, or be integrated into, spermatozoa, although in domestic livestock, including cattle, this seems to be a rare phenomenon, and carriage of virus through the zona pellucida into the oocyte by fertilising sperm has never been described in these species. Four specific viruses; enzootic bovine leukosis (EBLV), bovine herpesvirus-1 (BoHV-1), bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV) and bluetongue virus (BTV), all of which tend to cause subclinical infections in cattle, but which can occur in bovine semen, are examined with regard to the risks that use of infected semen might lead to production of infected embryos. With regard to in vivo-derived embryos, when internationally approved embryo processing protocols are used, the risks from EBLV- and BTV-infected semen are negligible, and the same is almost certainly true for semen infected with BoHV-1 if the embryos are also treated with trypsin. For BVDV, there is insufficient data on how the virus is carried in semen and how different BVDV strains can interact with sperm, oocytes and embryos. There is a potential, at least, that in vivo-derived embryos resulting from infected semen might carry BVDV, although field studies so far suggest that this is very unlikely. With regard to in vitro-produced embryos, use of semen infected with any of the four viruses, with the probable exception of EBLV, will often lead to contaminated embryos, and virus removal from these embryos is difficult even when the internationally approved embryo processing protocols are used. However, it has never been demonstrated that such embryos have resulted in transmission of infection to recipients or offspring.",,121,20050707,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our Affymetrix data revealed that A. phagocytophilum altered the expression of transcription factors, cell adhesion molecules, signal transduction genes, and proinflammatory cytokines. However, the expression of Toll-like receptors, MYD88, RNF36, IRF3, and TBK1 and inhibitors of the NF-kappaB gene was not altered. A. phagocytophilum infection also altered the apoptotic program of NB4 cells and resulted in increased transcription of antiapoptotic genes (MCL1 and BFL1). The transcription and translation of iron-metabolism genes (light polypeptide ferritin chain, transferrin, and the transferrin receptor) were significantly altered, suggesting a possible link between A. phagocytophilum infection and iron metabolism.

A critical role of cyclin A1 in the development of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has previously been demonstrated in transgenic mice. Our present study focused on the expression and prognostic significance of cyclin A1 and a panel of cell cycle regulatory proteins including cyclin A2, cyclin B1, cyclin E, CDK1, CDK2, p21 and p27 in bone marrow samples from 40 patients with AML. Freshly isolated CD34+ hematopoietic cells and bone marrow samples from 10 healthy donors were also assessed for cell type- and subcellular-specific expression of the cell cycle regulatory proteins. The level of cyclin A1 expression was the only factor that showed a significant correlation with patient outcome. In log-rank test stratified by levels of cyclin A1 expression, patients with high levels of cyclin A1 had significantly worse overall survival (OS) (P = 0.012) compared to those with low levels. Further, patients with high levels of cyclin A1 had significantly lower disease-free survival (DFS) (P = 0.028). Multivariate analysis indicated that cyclin A1 protein expression was an independent prognostic factor for predicting DFS (P = 0.035) and OS (P = 0.045). No correlation between cyclin A1 expression and age was found. However, expression of cyclin A2, cyclin B1, cyclin E, CDK1, CDK2, p21 and p27 did not show prognostic significance in these AML patients.","['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (CCNA1 protein, human)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin A)', '0 (Cyclin A1)']",,,['Copyright Blackwell Munksgaard 2005.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The human Jurkat T leukemia cell line was included as a positive control. Our studies show that BA exerts cytotoxic effects in some of the BL cell lines tested, including DG75, a chemoresistant BL cell line. However, cell death was caspase-independent, as evidenced by a lack of protection by zVAD-fmk, a pancaspase inhibitor, and displayed signs of necrosis. Furthermore, BA-induced caspase activation was seen to a minor extent in only 1 of the 10 BL cell lines tested (Ramos, a p53-deficient cell line), but was readily detected in Jurkat cells. Together, these studies indicate that resistance to BA-induced apoptosis is a common feature of BL-derived cell lines.","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Pentacyclic Triterpenes)', '0 (Triterpenes)', '4G6A18707N (betulinic acid)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",,,"['Copyright 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He had complained about diffuse abdominal pain and watery diarrhea during the preceding week. Correction of volume status did not result in an improvement of kidney function. Bacterial or viral enteritis could be excluded as well as a mucosa-associated lymphatic tissue lymphoma (MALT-lymphoma). Shortly thereafter, the patient developed a subileus. INVESTIGATIONS: Kidney biopsy showed a low degree nephrosclerosis and some interstitial fibrosis, but no signs of rejection. The abdominal CT scan showed enlarged lymph nodes partially obstructing the intestinal lumen. Histology showed an EBV-negative, highly aggressive B-blastic lymphoma. DIAGNOSIS: EBV-negative post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD). TREATMENT AND COURSE: Because of the advanced lymphoma stage immunosuppressive therapy was reduced and immunochemotherapy according to the CHOP-protocol (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone) in combination with rituximab (R-CHOP) was started. After 4 chemotherapy cycles the patient was in complete remission and another 2 therapy cycles were given for consolidation. The patient remained free of disease during the actual follow-up of 8 months. CONCLUSION: PTLD can present with unspecific abdominal symptoms including diarrhea and with signs of graft dysfunction.","['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'CHOP protocol']",,,,,,,,Lymphoproliferative Erkrankungen nach Nierentransplantation.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Interphase FISH, multiplex-FISH (M-FISH, SKY) and comparative genomic hybridisation (CGH) have emerged as the most significant of these. More recently, microarray technologies have come to prominence. In the acute leukaemias, the finding of characteristic gene expression signatures corresponding to biological subgroups has heralded gene expression profiling as a possible future alternative to current cytogenetic and morphological methods for diagnosis.

Symptoms of cardiac neoplasms (primary or metastatic) usually appear late in the course of the disease and are often ignored because of the more severe effects of the primary malignant disorder or its therapy. Consequently, cardiac neoplasms, especially metastatic ones, are often not discovered until autopsy. OBJECTIVES: To assess the incidence of cardiac neoplasms at autopsy and to determine the sites of origins of metastatic cardiac neoplasms. METHODS: The pathology records from consecutive autopsies performed at the University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, from January 1973 to May 2004 were reviewed. They showed 266 cases of neoplasms involving the heart among 11,432 consecutive autopsies. These cases were then categorized based on their system of origin and further subclassified into specific primary site categories. As well, the type of cardiac tissue affected was noted in 193 cases (72.6%). RESULTS: The 266 autopsy cases involving cardiac neoplasms represented 2.33% of the total number of autopsies. Among the 266 cases, two neoplasms were primaries, while 264 were metastatic in origin. Metastatic cardiac neoplasms most frequently metastasized from the respiratory system, followed (in order of decreasing frequency) by the hematopoietic, gastrointestinal, breast and genitourinary systems. A minority of metastatic cardiac neoplasms were found to have spread from other systems. Cardiac neoplasms most frequently involved the pericardium, followed (in order of decreasing frequency) by the myocardium, epicardium and endocardium. CONCLUSIONS: There were 132 times more metastatic cardiac neoplasms than primary cardiac neoplasms found in the present study. The most common sites of metastatic origin were the lungs, bone marrow (leukemia/multiple myeloma), breasts and lymph nodes (lymphoma). Leukemias were more prevalent in the present study than in previous studies. The pericardium was the tissue that was most frequently affected by metastatic cardiac neoplasms.",,,,,['Can J Cardiol. 2006 Jan;22(1):80. PMID: 16511961'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed medical records of 57 adult RI-CBT recipients. Preparative regimen comprised fludarabine, total-body irradiation, and either melphalan (n=51) or busulfan (n=6). Graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) prophylaxis was cyclosporine. PostRI-CBT immune reactions were classified according to time course: pre-engraftment immune reactions (PIR), engraftment syndrome (ES), and GvHD. RESULTS: Forty-five patients achieved engraftment at a median of day 19. PIR was characterized by high-grade fever and weight gain and developed on a median of day 9 in 35 of the 45 evaluable patients, including 3 who did not achieve engraftment. PIR subsided spontaneously in 12 patients, whereas corticosteroids were required in the other 23. ES and grade I to IV acute GvHD developed in 36 and 29 patients, respectively. GvHD could not be distinguished from preceding PIR or ES in 10 patients. Causes of the 32 nonrelapse mortalities included GvHD (n=5) and PIR (n=1). There were no significant differences in relapse and nonrelapse deaths between patients with PIR and those without it (18% vs. 5%, and 60% vs. 65%, respectively).

METHODS: Registry data on 6,275 adult patients with leukemia who received human leukocyte antigen-identical sibling transplants from 1989 to 1997 and survived at least 100 days after transplantation were evaluated for the study. Risk factors for BO were analyzed using proportional hazards regression. RESULTS: Seventy-six patients were found to have BO, with an incidence rate of 1.7% at 2 years after transplantation. The Kaplan-Meier estimate of median time to onset of BO was 431 days. Histologic evaluation was performed in 36 patients (47%). In 28 patients (37%), diagnosis was based on pulmonary function tests, CT scans of the chest, or a combination of both. On multivariate analysis, the factors that were associated with an increased risk for BO included the following: peripheral blood-derived stem cell, a busulfan-based conditioning regimen, interval from diagnosis to transplant > or = 14 months, female donor to male recipient sex match, prior interstitial pneumonitis, and an episode of moderate-to-severe acute graft-vs-host disease (GVHD). CONCLUSION: In addition to corroborating previously reported risk factors, such as acute GVHD and a busulfan-based conditioning regimen, we found that peripheral blood stem-cell transplantation, long duration to transplant, female donor to male recipient, and a prior episode of interstitial pneumonitis are associated with an increased risk for BO.",,,,,,,,['Chest. 2006 Jan;129(1):216'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2005 Jul 7.,"We used a panel of human and mouse fibroblasts with various abilities for supporting the prolonged growth of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) to elucidate growth factors required for hESC survival, proliferation, and maintenance of the undifferentiated and pluripotent state (self-renewal). We found that supportive feeder cells secrete growth factors required for both hESC survival/proliferation and blocking hESC spontaneous differentiation to achieve self-renewal. The antidifferentiation soluble factor is neither leukemia inhibitory factor nor Wnt, based on blocking experiments using their antagonists. Because Wnt/beta-catenin signaling has been implicated in cell-fate determination and stem cell expansion, we further examined the effects of blocking or adding recombinant Wnt proteins on undifferentiated hESCs. In the absence of feeder cell-derived factors, hESCs cultured under a feeder-free condition survived/proliferated poorly and gradually differentiated. Adding recombinant Wnt3a stimulated hESC proliferation but also differentiation. After 4-5 days of Wnt3a treatment, hESCs that survived maintained the undifferentiated phenotype but few could form undifferentiated hESC colonies subsequently. Using a functional reporter assay, we found that the beta-catenin-mediated transcriptional activation in the canonical Wnt pathway was minimal in undifferentiated hESCs, but greatly upregulated during differentiation induced by the Wnt treatment and several other methods. Thus, Wnt/beta-catenin activation does not suffice to maintain the undifferentiated and pluripotent state of hESCs. We propose a new model for the role of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in undifferentiated hESCs.","['0 (Wnt Proteins)', '0 (beta Catenin)', '62031-54-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factors)']",,20050707,,,['HL73781/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the mechanisms regulating CD1D1 expression are largely unknown. In this study, we have characterized the upstream region of the CD1D1 gene and identified a minimal promoter region within 200 bp from the translational start site of CD1D1 that exhibits cell-type specific promoter activity. Analysis of this region revealed an Ets binding site critical for CD1D1 promoter activity. Gel shift assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments showed that Elf-1 and PU.1 bind to the CD1D1 promoter.

In this study, TCL1 is shown to regulate the growth and survival of peripheral T cells but not precursor thymocytes. Proliferation is increased by TCL1-induced lowering of the TCR threshold for CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell activation through both PI3K-Akt and protein kinase C-MAPK-ERK signaling pathways. This effect is submaximal as CD28 costimulation coupled to TCL1 expression additively accelerates dose-dependent T cell growth. In addition to its role in T cell proliferation, TCL1 also increases IFN-gamma levels from Th1-differentiated T cells, an effect that may provide a survival advantage during premalignant T cell expansions and in clonal T cell tumors. Combined, these data indicate a role for TCL1 control of growth and effector T cell functions, paralleling features provided by TCR-CD28 costimulation. These results also provide a more detailed mechanism for TCL1-augmented signaling and help explain the delayed occurrence of mature T cell expansions and leukemias despite tumorigenic TCL1 dysregulation that begins in early thymocytes.","['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (TCL1A protein, human)', '0 (Tcl1 protein, mouse)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)']",,,,,"['CA 107300/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 16672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 90571/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In murine mixed chimeras prepared with nonmyeloablative conditioning, we previously showed that recipient leukocyte infusions (RLI) induced loss of donor chimerism, IFN-gamma production, and antitumor responses against host-type tumors. However, the mechanisms behind this phenomenon remain to be determined. We now demonstrate that the effects of RLI are mediated by distinct and complex mechanisms. Donor marrow rejection is induced by RLI-derived alloactivated T cells, which activate non-RLI-derived, recipient IFN-gamma-producing cells. RLI-derived CD8 T cells induce the production of IFN-gamma by both RLI and non-RLI-derived recipient cells. The antitumor responses of RLI involve mainly RLI-derived IFN-gamma-producing CD8 T cells and recipient-derived CD4 T cells and do not involve donor T cells. The pathways of donor marrow and tumor rejection lead to the development of tumor-specific cell-mediated cytotoxic responses that are not due to bystander killing by alloreactive T cells.",['82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)'],,,,,['R01 CA 79989/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We determined the consequence if 1 HSC became able to survive without the support of a microenvironmental niche while the rest of its behavior did not change. Neoplastic cells persisted and dominated hematopoiesis in 14% of mice and 17% of cats, requiring mean times of 2.5 +/- 0.5 and 7.0 +/- 1.2 years, respectively (n=1000 simulations/species). In both species, when the number of neoplastic HSCs exceeded 0.5% of all HSCs, clonal dominance was inevitable. Our results can explain the absence of clonal myeloproliferative disorders in mice (lifetime, 2 years), are consistent with clinical observations in cats, and provide insight into the progression of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) in humans. They also demonstrate that competition for microenvironmental support can lead to the suppression of normal hematopoiesis as neoplasia evolves.

Such ""reactivation"" is thought to play a crucial role in the spread of BLV from infected to uninfected cattle. In the present study, we found that the expression of BLV in samples of whole blood from BLV-infected cattle was activated immediately upon incubation at 37 degrees C and that such activation did not require the addition of any exogenous factors except for anticoagulants or the removal of blood cells from plasma. The expression of BLV was repressed by an inhibitor of protein kinase C (PKC), namely, H-7, and by a membrane-permeable chelator of Ca2+ ions, BAPTA/AM. We also found that several isotypes of PKC were translocated immediately from the cytoplasm to the membrane fraction upon incubation of whole blood at 37 degrees C. Our data suggest that the actual collection of blood and pathways that involve PKC and Ca2+ might play important roles in the reactivation of expression of BLV in blood from infected cattle.","['0 (Activating Transcription Factors)', '0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Blood Proteins)', '0 (Chelating Agents)', '0 (Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', ""139890-68-9 (1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid"", 'acetoxymethyl ester)', '526U7A2651 (Egtazic Acid)', '84477-87-2 (1-(5-Isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-Methylpiperazine)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we tested their effect on the highly malignant N-type neuroblastoma (Nb) cells and their differentiated, neurone-like counterparts. Nb cells were highly susceptible to several VE analogues, while differentiated Nb cells were relatively resistant to alpha-TOS. The importance of caspase-9 rather than caspase-8, as judged by specific siRNAs studies, together with the loss of the inner mitochondrial potential, suggests that alpha-TOS triggers apoptosis in Nb cells via the mitochondrial pathway. Cultured Nb cells were sensitized to alpha-TOS by pre-treatment with Bcl-2, Bcl-xL or Mcl-1 siRNAs, while the malignant cell line was more resistant to the vitamin E analogue when Bax was knocked down. In contrast, overexpression of Bcl-2 in Nb cells rendered them more resistant to alpha-TOS-induced apoptosis. The resistance of differentiated Nb cells to alpha-TOS-mediated apoptosis occurred via two modes: first, by up-regulation of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins and second, by accumulation of decreased levels of reactive oxygen species when challenged with alpha-TOS. We conclude that alpha-TOS is highly selective in killing malignant brain cancer cells while relatively inert toward differentiated neuronal cells, and that vitamin E analogues may be novel therapeutics for the treatment of tumours such as neuroblastomas.","['0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '1406-18-4 (Vitamin E)', 'R0ZB2556P8 (Tocopherols)']",,20050707,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVES: To describe three recent cases of severe haematological disease presumably induced by an occupational exposure to benzene. Exposure occurred as a result of contact with ordinary automobile petrol used as a solvent-degreaser for metal parts. METHODS: Clinical diagnosis was performed using standard immuno-phenotypic and morphological criteria; the hypothesis of an occupational origin was derived from analysis of the occupational histories. RESULTS: The first case was a 59 year-old blacksmith suffering from acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) FAB M2, who had used petrol for 36 years to degrease the forged metal parts before painting them. The second was a 53 year-old mechanic with AML FAB M3 who had used petrol for 15 years to degrease mechanical parts of tanker motors. The third was an 82 year-old car mechanic suffering from idiopathic myelofibrosis since the age of 75, who had used petrol to degrease mechanical car motor parts for 42 years. In all three cases, the environmental hygiene measures necessary to limit inhalation or skin contact were not followed and, at times, in the case of the two mechanics, the petrol was siphoned by mouth; so there was substantial exposure to the 1-5% benzene present in the petrol. Latency of the disease was between 30-50 years from start of exposure, and between 3-17 years following cessation of exposure. CONCLUSION: The cases described indicate that the myelotoxic effects of benzene are still a problem. They were the consequence of improper use of petrol, due to total misinformation of the risks involved in such use. It is not possible to ascertain whether the cases presented are a casual aggregation or if the use of petrol as a solvent is more common than is normally believed; in the latter case two questions must be asked: is a ""normal"" occupational history able to discover such an uncommon risky condition of exposure? If it cannot, how many cases of benzene-related diseases escape aetiological diagnosis? It is not possible to provide precise answers but efforts should be made to improve the quality of information about the risks of petrol. Furthermore, in all cases of haematological disease potentially related to benzene, any form of contact with petrol, even if uncommon, should be carefully researched.","['0 (Gasoline)', '0 (Solvents)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A1)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (glutathione S-transferase M1)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (glutathione transferase T1-1, human)']",,,,['Med Lav. 2005 Sep-Oct;96(5):447-51.

The purpose of our study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) as the salvage therapy for steroid-refractory GvHD. Twenty one patients (10 with acute GvHD and 11 with chronic GvHD) were studied retrospectively. Steroid-resistant GvHD was defined as acute or chronic GvHD not responding to a first-line regimen of cyclosporine A and corticosteroids in a dose equivalent to 2 mg/kg methylprednisolone for at least 7 days. MMF was added at a dose of 2 g daily, and corticosteroids were tapered. Thirteen (62%) of 21 patients responded to the treatment with MMF, including 6 (60%) of 10 patients with acute refractory GvHD and 7 (64%) of 11 patients with chronic refractory GvHD. The most common adverse effects were infectious complications (67%, 14 of 21 patients) and hematological toxicity (29%, 6 of 21 patients). Median duration of MMF administration was 6 months (range 1-27 months). Sixteen of 21 patients were alive after the median follow-up of 27 months (range 1-72 months) after the initiation of MMF therapy. All 16 surviving patients were in good clinical condition and in remission of their hematological malignancy. Five patients died--two of relapses of leukemia and three of refractory intestinal GvHD. These results suggest that MMF can be an effective treatment for some cases of steroid-refractory GvHD.","['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', 'HU9DX48N0T (Mycophenolic Acid)']",,20050707,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A first cohort of five patients received HD-Mel as salvage therapy after a previous cycle of mitoxantrone, topotecan and cytarabine (MTC) had failed in four out of five patients, while a second cohort of nine patients received HD-Mel in untreated relapse. Thirteen (93%) of 14 patients achieved a second complete remission (CR2), including all four patients who had been refractory to MTC. No treatment-related mortality was observed after HD-Mel. Thirteen (93%) patients were able to proceed to a dose-reduced allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) from human-leucocyte-antigens-compatible unrelated (n=12) or sibling donors (n=1) in CR2 (n=11) or poor recovery/relapse (n=2) after a median of 2 (1.7-4.5) months following HD-Mel.

Nine patients are alive in CR2 after a median of 6 (2-49) months after HD-Mel and a median of 4 (0.6-47) months after a sequential allo-SCT. Although median follow-up is still short, the proportion of patients achieving a CR2, as well as of those proceeding to a subsequent reduced-intensity-conditioning-allo-SCT, is superior to those previously reported.

Regarding T-cell NHL and >5 year latency period, the use of analogue cellular phones yielded: odds ratio (OR) = 1.46, 95%; confidence interval (CI) = 0.58-3.70, digital: OR=1.92, 95%; CI=0.77-4.80 and cordless phones: OR=2.47; CI=1.09-5.60. The corresponding results for certain, e.g. cutaneous and leukaemia, T-cell lymphoma for analogue phones were: OR=3.41, 95%; CI=0.78-15.0, digital: OR=6.12, 95%; CI=1.26-29.7 and cordless phones: OR=5.48, 95%; CI=1.26-23.9. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate an association between T-cell NHL and the use of cellular and cordless telephones, however based on low numbers and must be interpreted with caution. Regarding B-cell NHL no association was found.",,,20051012,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2005 Nov 5.,"PURPOSE: Naturally occurring flavonoids such as quercetin and genistein possess cancer chemopreventive properties in experimental models. However, adverse effects such as their mutagenicity confound their potential clinical usefulness. Furthermore in leukaemia cells some flavonoids cleave the breakpoint cluster region of the mixed lineage leukaemia (MLL) gene as a consequence of inhibition of topoisomerase II. The choice of flavonoids to be developed as cancer chemopreventive agents depends crucially on their safety. Here, we explored safety aspects of the novel flavone tricin, a constituent of rice bran and other grass species, which has recently been found to interfere with murine gastrointestinal carcinogenesis. METHODS: Evidence of pathological or morphological changes in liver, lung, heart, spleen, kidney, adrenal gland, pancreas or thymus tissues was studied in mice which received tricin, genistein or quercetin 1,000 mg/kg daily by the oral route on five consecutive days. The ability of tricin (50 microM) to cleave the MLL gene was studied in human leukaemia cells by Southern blotting, and its effect on human topoisomerase II activity was investigated in incubations with supercoiled DNA. The mutagenicity of tricin was assessed in the Salmonella/Escherichia coli assay, and its clastogenicity was adjudged by chromosomal aberrations in Chinese hamster ovary cells and occurrence of micronuclei in bone marrow erythrocytes in Swiss-Webster mice. RESULTS: Neither tricin, quercetin, or genistein caused pathological or morphological changes in any of the murine tissues studied. Tricin (50 microM) failed to cause MLL gene breakage, and it inhibited topoisomerase II only at 500 microM, but not at 10, 50 or 100 microM. Tricin lacked genotoxic properties in the systems studied here. CONCLUSION: The results tentatively suggest that tricin may be considered safe enough for clinical development as a cancer chemopreventive agent.","['0 (Anticarcinogenic Agents)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'D51JZL38TQ (tricin)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)']",,20051105,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, BCR/ABL-positive progenitors often persist despite treatment, and relapse associated with resistance to imatinib has been described in many patients with advanced disease. Drug efflux by P-glycoprotein (P-gp), as well as point mutations in BCR/ABL oncoprotein, has been implicated in the mechanism of resistance to imatinib. In this study, we established a murine transplantation model of CML-like myeloproliferative disease using Mdr1a/1b-null mice and analyzed the effects of loss of P-gp on resistance to imatinib. We found that mice transplanted with Mdr1a/1b-null bone marrow (BM) that had been transduced with a BCR/ABL retroviral vector displayed similar responses to imatinib, compared with those transplanted with BCR/ABL-transduced wild-type BM. In the absence of P-gp, the incidence and latency of disease in secondary recipients was not changed in imatinib-treated mice, relative to wild-type controls. Furthermore, K562 cells engineered to overexpress P-gp remained sensitive to imatinib-induced growth inhibition and cell death. Together, our findings suggest that P-gp expression in hematopoietic stem cells does not significantly contribute to imatinib resistance in CML.","['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",,,,"['Leukemia. 2006 Jan;20(1):144; author reply 144-5.

A total of 42 AML samples (16 newly diagnosed, 26 relapsed/refractory) were analyzed. Normal bone marrow CD34+ cells (n = 10) had little or no expression of p-ERK, while G-CSF-mobilized CD34+ cells exhibited enhanced p-ERK levels. Markedly elevated p-ERK levels were found in 83.3% of the AML samples, with no differences observed between the newly diagnosed and relapsed/refractory samples. Treatment with a MEK inhibitor resulted in significantly decreased p-ERK levels in both the newly diagnosed and relapsed/refractory samples, which was associated with growth arrest, but not apoptosis induction. In summary, we defined conditions for the analysis of MAPK signaling in primary AML samples. Normal CD34+ cells expressed very low levels of p-ERK, and increased p-ERK levels were found in normal G-CSF-stimulated circulating CD34+ cells. Constitutively high p-ERK levels observed in the majority of AML samples suggest deregulation of this pathway that appears to be independent of disease status.

A heightened awareness and appreciation of the immune-mediated anticancer effects that occur after allogeneic transplantation has led to the increasing use of reduced-intensity stem cell transplantation (RIST) approaches to treat advanced malignancies. The graft-versus-leukemia effects that occur against hematologic cancers after RIST have recently attracted oncologists to explore the therapeutic potential of allogeneic HCT for treatment-refractory solid tumors. Delayed tumor regression after RIST in a subset of patients with metastatic renal cell, breast, ovarian, pancreatic, and colon carcinoma has recently been reported, confirming the existence of a graft-versus-tumor effect in solid tumors. Advanced disease states, rapidly growing tumors, and accrual of patients with extremely short survival are factors that have been identified to limit the efficacy of allogeneic immunotherapy.

Through a tetracycline-regulated COX-2 overexpression system, we found that COX-2 inhibits detachment-induced apoptosis (anoikis) in a human bladder cancer cell line, EJ. We also found that the inhibition of anoikis by COX-2 results from activation of the PI-3K/Akt pathway as evidenced by suppression of the COX-2 effect on anoikis by a PI-3K inhibitor, LY294002. Furthermore, COX-2 enhanced Mcl-1 expression in the anoikis process, implying that Mcl-1 also may be involved in mediating the survival function of COX-2. Together, these results suggest that COX-2 inhibits anoikis by activation of the PI-3K/Akt pathway and probably by enhancement of Mcl-1 expression in human bladder cancer cells.

Treatment of HL60, a human promyelocyte leukemia cell line, with ROS, generated by a combination of hypoxanthine and xanthine oxidase (HX/XO), decreased the sialic acid content on the cell surface, as indicated by a flow cytometric analysis involving sialic acid-specific lectins, and a concomitant increase of free sialic acid was observed in the supernatant. A cell adhesion assay showed that the HX/XO treatment of HL60 cells decreases their capability of binding to human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), probably because of an impairment of the interaction involving E-selectin, whereas the decrease in the binding was canceled by the addition of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase. In fact, cell surface sialyl lewis x (sLe x), but not lewis x (Le x), was decreased by HX/XO treatment. Thus, it is more likely that the impaired interaction is based on diminished levels of the selectin ligand. Cleavage of sialic acid by ROS was further verified by the degradation of 4MU-Neu5Ac by HX/XO in the presence of hydrogen peroxide and iron ion. These results indicate that glycosidic linkage of sialic acid is a potential target for superoxide and other related ROS. It is well known that ROS cause cellular damages such as lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation, but, as suggested by the findings reported in the literature, ROS may also regulate cell adhesion via the structural alteration of sialylated oligosaccharides on the cell surface.","['0 (E-Selectin)', '0 (Oligosaccharides)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Sialyl Lewis X Antigen)', '3T5NG4Q468 (Hymecromone)', ""59322-44-0 (2'-(4-methylumbelliferyl)-alpha-D-N-acetylneuraminic acid)"", 'EC 1.11.1.6 (Catalase)', 'EC 1.15.1.1 (Superoxide Dismutase)', 'EC 1.17.3.2 (Xanthine Oxidase)', 'GZP2782OP0 (N-Acetylneuraminic Acid)']",,20050706,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These include induction chemotherapy and concurrent chemoradiotherapy. Both approaches have been shown to be superior to radiation therapy alone. However, in several randomized trials, concomitant chemoradiotherapy was shown to be superior to the induction chemotherapy approach. It has been hypothesized that the addition of systemic dose sequential chemotherapy to concurrent chemoradiotherapy, either as induction or as consolidation chemotherapy, might further improve survival rates. Recently, the Cancer and Leukemia Group B reported on a randomized phase III trial directly evaluating the addition of two cycles of carboplatin and paclitaxel to concurrent chemoradiotherapy. In this study, induction chemotherapy failed to further improve survival rates of concurrent chemoradiotherapy. A previously conducted randomized phase II study also suggested no benefit from the addition of induction chemotherapy to concomitant chemoradiotherapy. Favorable phase II data have been published supporting the use of consolidation chemotherapy. However, to date, no large randomized study evaluating a possible benefit from consolidation chemotherapy has been completed. In addition to evaluating optimal sequencing strategies of combined modality therapy, current investigations are also focusing on the integration of novel agents, including chemotherapeutic and targeted therapies. Currently ongoing trials involving novel approaches are reviewed here.",,54,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because the expression of these genes is not known to be linked, we sought to determine the therapeutic value of silencing both genes simultaneously in K562 and primary patient (n = 9) chronic myelogenous leukemia cells. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: K562 and primary chronic myelogenous leukemia cells were exposed to antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (alone or in combination) for 24 or 72 hours and then cloned in methylcellulose cultures. Effects on K562 cluster, and blast-forming unit-erythroid colonies and granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming units were determined and correlated with the ability to down-regulate the targeted mRNA. RESULTS: After 24-hour exposure, K562 cell growth was inhibited in a sequence specific, dose-responsive manner with either c-myb or Vav antisense oligodeoxynucleotides. Exposure to both oligodeoxynucleotides simultaneously considerably enhanced growth inhibition and accelerated apoptosis. Primary cell results were more complex. After 24- and 72-hour exposures to either anti-vav or anti-myb antisense oligodeoxynucleotides, equivalent colony-forming unit inhibition was observed. Exposing cells to both antisense oligodeoxynucleotides simultaneously for 24 hours did not result in additional inhibition of colony formation. However, after 72-hour incubation with both oligodeoxynucleotides, colony formation was diminished significantly when compared with either oligodeoxynucleotides alone (from approximately 30% to approximately 78% for granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming unit; approximately 50% to approximately 80% for blast-forming unit-erythroid). CONCLUSIONS: We hypothesize that exposing primary leukemic cells to antisense oligodeoxynucleotides targeted to two, or possibly more, genes might significantly augment the therapeutic utility of these molecules.","['0 (MYC protein, human)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",,,,,['R01CA 10859/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This has, however, not been confirmed in randomized studies due to high toxicity of purging modalities for normal progenitor/stem cells. In this study, we investigated whether positive selection for CD34+ and/or CD133+ cells, which results in high recovery of normal progenitor/stem cells, is applicable for purging AML grafts. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Positive selections of normal stem cells using CD34 and/or CD133 can be done if one or both markers are absent or have dim expression and remain so during the course of the disease. Marker expressions in newly diagnosed AML were measured with flow cytometry using a cutoff value for positivity of 1%. Stability of marker expression was studied by pairwise comparison of material at diagnosis and relapse. Leukemia associated phenotype expression was used to measure the efficacy of tumor cell reduction. RESULTS: In newly diagnosed AML (n = 165), we found no CD34 and/or CD133 expression in 32% of the cases and dim expression in 20% of the cases. No increase in the percentage of CD34+ cells (n = 44) and CD133+ cells (n = 29) was found in corresponding relapses. Positive selection using grafts contaminated with AML blasts, showing either no or dim expression of CD34 or CD133, resulted in a 3 to 4 log tumor cell reduction (n = 11) with median 50% recovery of normal stem cells.

METHODS: A total of 809 patients with essential thrombocythemia who were at high risk for vascular events received low-dose aspirin plus either anagrelide or hydroxyurea. The composite primary end point was the actuarial risk of arterial thrombosis (myocardial infarction, unstable angina, cerebrovascular accident, transient ischemic attack, or peripheral arterial thrombosis), venous thrombosis (deep-vein thrombosis, splanchnic-vein thrombosis, or pulmonary embolism), serious hemorrhage, or death from thrombotic or hemorrhagic causes. RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 39 months, patients in the anagrelide group were significantly more likely than those in the hydroxyurea group to have reached the primary end point (odds ratio, 1.57; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.04 to 2.37; P=0.03). As compared with hydroxyurea plus aspirin, anagrelide plus aspirin was associated with increased rates of arterial thrombosis (P=0.004), serious hemorrhage (P=0.008), and transformation to myelofibrosis (P=0.01) but with a decreased rate of venous thromboembolism (P=0.006). Patients receiving anagrelide were more likely to withdraw from their assigned treatment (P<0.001). Equivalent long-term control of the platelet count was achieved in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Hydroxyurea plus low-dose aspirin is superior to anagrelide plus low-dose aspirin for patients with essential thrombocythemia at high risk for vascular events.","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors)', '0 (Quinazolines)', 'K9X45X0051 (anagrelide)', 'R16CO5Y76E (Aspirin)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",,,['Copyright 2005 Massachusetts Medical Society.'],['N Engl J Med. 2005 Jul 7;353(1):85-6.

A widely accepted notion in FA research invokes a deficiency of response to DNA damage as the fundamental basis of the 'crosslinker sensitivity' observed in this disorder. However, such an isolated defect cannot readily account for the full cellular and clinical phenotype, which includes a number of other abnormalities, such as malformations, endocrinopathies, and typical skin spots. An extensive body of evidence pointing toward an involvement of oxidative stress in the FA phenotype includes the following: (i) In vitro and ex vivo abnormalities in a number of redox status endpoints; (ii) the functions of several FA proteins in protecting cells from oxidative stress; (iii) redox-related toxicity mechanisms of the xenobiotics evoking excess toxicity in FA cells. The clinical features in FA and the in vivo abnormalities of redox parameters are here reconsidered in view of the pleiotropic clinical phenotype and known biochemical and molecular links to an in vivo prooxidant state, which causes oxidative damage to biomolecules, resulting in an excessive number of acquired abnormalities that may overwhelm the cellular repair capacity rather than a primary deficiency in DNA repair. FA may thus represent a unique model disease in testing the integration between the acquisition of macromolecular damage as a result of oxidative stress and the ability of the mammalian cell to respond effectively to such damage.","['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)']",76,,['Copyright Blackwell Munksgaard 2005.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To circumvent this problem, we cloned T cell receptor (TCR) alpha and beta chains from a tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte clone specific for an RCC tumor antigen and transferred the TCR into human T cell lines and primary T lymphocytes. Efficient TCR expression in primary T lymphocytes was obtained only with a mouse myeloproliferative sarcoma virus (MPSV)-based retroviral vector, not with a Moloney murine leukemia virus (MLV)-based vector, although both viral supernatants were similar in titer, as shown by analysis of copy number integration in transduced T cells. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed a higher amount of TCR-encoding transcripts when T cells were transduced with the MPSV vector in comparison with the MLV vector, indicating that high TCR expression levels can be achieved by appropriate cis-regulatory vector elements. The biological activity of the transferred TCR was shown by specific lysis of RCC cells ((51)Cr release assay) and by interferon gamma and tumor necrosis factor alpha release (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) in an antigen-specific and HLA-A*0201-restricted fashion. Comparison of the redirected T lymphocytes with the original tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte clone revealed similar killing and cytokine secretion capabilities. The functional activity of TCR-redirected T lymphocytes was stable over time. The results demonstrate that use of an optimized retroviral vector yielded a high TCR transduction efficiency and stable and high TCR expression in primary human T lymphocytes and redirected their specificity toward RCC cells.","['0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The current study analyzed 47 patients with BNKL (27 had leukemias and 20 had lymphomas). Patient data were collected for the survey of the NK-Cell Tumor Study Group. RESULTS: There were 33 males and 14 females, with a median age of 53 years (range, 3 months to 89 years). There were few clinicopathologic differences between the leukemia and lymphoma types. Cutaneous involvement was noted at diagnosis in 28 patients, who presented a tendency for older age of onset (median: 56 vs. 46 years, P = 0.11) than patients with noncutaneous BNKL. Cutaneous BNKL showed less frequent mediastinal involvement (4% vs. 53%, P = 0.0002) and less severe thrombocytopenia (P =0 .03). Phenotypic characteristics were also different, with cutaneous BNKL favoring CD4 and HLA-DR expression, and noncutaneous BNKL favoring CD16 and CD34 expression. Both groups responded well to chemotherapy for lymphoid malignancies, but disease recurrence was frequent. The prognosis of patients with noncutaneous BNKL was significantly poorer than that of patients with cutaneous BNKL (median survival: 15 vs. 25 months, P = 0.02). Multivariate analysis confirmed that cutaneous involvement was a significant and independent prognostic factor for BNKL, as were age of onset and leukocyte count. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggested that BNKL is a heterogeneous disease and contains at least two subtypes. Although further investigations are needed to settle a marker for distinction, the presence of cutaneous involvement is a useful prognostic factor.","['0 (CD56 Antigen)', '0 (IL3RA protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-3 Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-3)', 'EC 2.7.7.31 (DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['NK-cell Tumor Study Group'],,,,,

METHODS: The infection, thrombosis, and surgical complication rates (chi-square test), as well as mean catheter-indwelling-days (t-test) were compared. Kaplan Meier analysis and stratified log rank test were used to compare actuarial survival rates. Cox proportion hazard model was applied to analyze the outcomes predictors. RESULTS: The total catheter-indwelling-day was 116,603 days in general for this cohort. The Groshong catheters (569 +/- 386.1 days) had longer (P < 0.001) mean catheter-indwelling-day than did Deltec catheters (239 +/- 235.6 days). But the per 1,000 catheter day infection (Deltec 0.18, Groshong 0.16), thrombosis (Deltec 0.07, Groshong 0.06), and surgical complication rates (Deltec 0.07, Groshong 0.02) were equivalent (P > 0.05) between two groups. Patients with leukemia were at higher risk (odds ratio 13.4, P = 0.009) to develop adverse events. However, two types of catheters had similar actuarial survival rates at end of follow up (P > 0.05).

Three different types of probes are used: (1) centromeric probes for numerical chromosome abnormalities, (2) whole chromosome paints, and (3) locus-specific probes.

In this regard, immunoglobulin variable (V) region gene analysis already is having a significant impact in delineating the tumor cell of origin. It can identify, among other features whether such a cell has undergone somatic mutation, which usually occurs within germinal centres. Remarkably, in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), the mutational status of V genes has allowed researchers to identify two subsets of disease, one originating from an unmutated B-cell with a markedly poorer disease outcome and the other from a mutated B-cell, which associates with long-term survival. The V gene status in CLL thus provides a robust indicator of disease outcome, which is beginning to shape clinical treatment.

Among the compounds inducing neutrophilic differentiation was DAPH1 (4,5-dianilinophthalimide), previously reported to inhibit epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) kinase activity. Here we report that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved EGFR inhibitor gefitinib similarly promotes the differentiation of AML cell lines and primary patient-derived AML blasts in vitro. Gefitinib induced differentiation based on morphologic assessment, nitro-blue tetrazolium reduction, cell-surface markers, genome-wide patterns of gene expression, and inhibition of proliferation at clinically achievable doses. Importantly, EGFR expression was not detected in AML cells, indicating that gefitinib functions through a previously unrecognized EGFR-independent mechanism.

Its functional importance is evident from the multiple levels and developmental stages of the regulation of its expression. We here report the discovery of a novel regulatory exon upstream of the noncoding region of the CD5 gene in humans. This alternate exon 1 is designated E1B (with the conventional exon 1 renamed E1A) and was shown to regulate the expression of CD5. E1B-containing transcripts existed exclusively in B lymphocytes and encoded a protein that was truncated and retained intracellularly. As a consequence, the amount of E1A-containing transcripts was down-regulated and the membrane CD5 expression was diminished in the presence of E1B-containing transcripts. High levels of E1A transcripts were found in chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and there were no E1A transcripts in 697 pre-B cells, which have no membrane CD5. Introduction of E1B into Jurkat cells reduced their membrane expression of CD5, and sequence analysis revealed that the E1B motif is a defective human endogenous retrovirus. A balance between the 2 alternative exons 1 might be central to the regulation of membrane CD5 in human B cells, and, through CD5-associated SH2-containing phosphatase 1, to the modulation of B-cell antigen receptor-transduced signals.","['0 (CD5 Antigens)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",,20050705,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Constitutive activation of signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3) and STAT5 is frequently detected in various hematopoietic tumors. To evaluate their role in normal and leukemic stem cells, we took advantage of constitutively active STAT mutants to activate STAT signaling selectively in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Activation of STAT5 in CD34- c-Kit+ Sca-1+ lineage marker- (CD34- KSL) HSCs led to a drastic expansion of multipotential progenitors and promoted HSC self-renewal ex vivo. In sharp contrast, STAT3 was demonstrated to be dispensable for the HSC maintenance in vivo, and its activation facilitated lineage commitment of HSCs in vitro. In a mouse model of myeloproliferative disease (MPD), sustained STAT5 activation in CD34- KSL HSCs but not in CD34+ KSL multipotential progenitors induced fatal MPD, indicating that the capacity of STAT5 to promote self-renewal of hematopoietic stem cells is crucial to MPD development.

However, DMSO significantly potentiated mitochondrial membrane depolarization, suggesting that this mechanism might be involved in sensitisation of myeloid cells to DR-mediated apoptosis.","['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (CASP8 and FADD-Like Apoptosis Regulating Protein)', '0 (CFLAR protein, human)', '0 (Cryoprotective Agents)', '0 (FADD protein, human)', '0 (Fas-Associated Death Domain Protein)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNFSF10 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (fas Receptor)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP8 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",,20050705,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Descriptive survey was used. We reviewed the files of six Mexico City hospitals from 1980 to 1992. We included 4595 cases divided into 13 types of cancer. Peak age was defined when in that year we encountered a frequency equal to or below 10 % of the cases. RESULTS: Peak ages for hepatic, sympathetic nervous system, germ cell tumors, retinoblastoma and rhabdomyosarcoma were between 2 and 3 years of age. Wilms' tumor appeared between the first and fourth years; central nervous system tumors between 4 and 5 years; acute lymphoblastic leukemia between 2 and 4 years; non-Hodgkin's lymphomas between 3 and 6 years; Hodgkin's disease between 4 and 8 years; bone tumors between 10 and 14 years. In acute myeloid leukemia and carcinomas no age peak was found. CONCLUSIONS: Lymphomas present an age peak different from that reported in developed countries. In neonates and infants, the most frequent tumor was retinoblastoma.",,,,,,,,,Edad de aparicion de los diferentes tumores malignos en la infancia.,,,,,,,,,,,,

This progress had led to the development of small molecules that specifically inhibit the abnormally activated kinase. The first example of such targeted therapy is imatinib-mesylate, an inhibitor of the BCR-ABL fusion gene that is found in more than 90% of patients with Philadelphia positive (Ph+) chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and in 20-30% of those with Ph+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The excellent clinical results obtained with imatinib in CML have completely changed the therapeutic approach to this disease, and imatinib is now the gold standard for treatment of newly diagnosed CML. This has instigated a tremendous effort to develop targeted PTK therapy based on the presence of over 40 chromosomal translocations that lead to deregulation of 12 different PTK associated with various hematologic malignancies. That deregulated PTK are also involved in the pathogenesis of acute leukemia is underlined by the frequent occurrence of mutations leading to constitutive activation of the FLT3. Experimental as well as clinical evidence supports a model of acute leukemia based on the co-operation of constitutive active PTK with mutations of transcriptional regulators. Here we review the general impact of mutated PTK on the pathogenesis of various hematologic malignancies. We also discuss the development of new targeted therapies and strategies to circumvent the increasing problems related to the emergence of drug resistance by targeting downstream signaling mediators that are essential for transformation by deregulated PTK.","['EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",178,,,['Haematologica. 2005 Jul;90(7):871-4.

While little is known about ZAP-70 expression in normal human B cells, it has been reported that ZAP-70 is expressed in a subset of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) with a poor prognosis. In this study, we examined the expression and phosphorylation status of ZAP-70 in B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Blin-ALL). DESIGN AND METHODS: First, ZAP-70 protein expression was assessed by Western blotting and flow cytometry and ZAP-70 mRNA transcripts were analyzed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on human precursor B cell lines. Experiments were then carried out on cells obtained from 18 patients with Blin-ALL and from normal human bone marrow. RESULTS: ZAP-70 was constitutively expressed and phosphorylated on tyr319 in human precursor Blin-ALL cell lines as well as in primary B leukemic cells from all examined Blin-ALL patients with pro-B, pre-B and B phenotypes, but not in malignant myeloid cells. Importantly, analysis of normal human bone marrow revealed expression of ZAP-70 transcripts only in the CD34+ cell fraction (either CD19-CD10- or CD19+CD10+) but not in the CD34- cell fraction (CD19+sIgM- pre-B cells or CD19+sIgM+ immature B cells). INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: ZAP-70 was found to be expressed in the CD34+ normal bone marrow compartment including earlier B-cell progenitors, but not in CD34- pre-B and immature B cells. By contrast, ZAP-70 was consistently expressed and phosphorylated in Blin-ALL cells. Further studies are required to determine whether ZAP-70 may play a pathophysiological role in Blin-ALL.","['0 (Antigens, CD34)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)']",,,,['Haematologica. 2005 Jul;90(7):867.

We set out to use microarray technology to identify novel genes relevant for leukemogenesis. To this end we used a unique leukemia-enriched cDNA microarray platform. DESIGN AND METHODS: The systematic sequencing of cDNA libraries of normal and leukemic bone marrow allowed us to increase the number of genes to yield a new release of a previously generated cDNA microarray. Using this platform we analyzed the expression profiles of 4,670 genes in bone marrow samples from 18 pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). RESULTS: Expression profiling consistently distinguished the leukemia patients into three groups, those with T-ALL, B-ALL and B-ALL with MLL/AF4 rearrangement, in agreement with the clinical classification. Our platform identified 30 genes that best discriminate these three subtypes. Using mini-array technology these 30 genes were validated in another cohort of 17 patients. In particular we identified two novel genes not previously reported: endomucin (EMCN) and ubiquitin specific protease 33 (USP33) that appear to be over-expressed in B-ALL relative to their expression in T-ALL. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Microarray technology not only allows the distinction between disease subclasses but also offers a chance to identify new genes involved in leukemogenesis. Our approach of using a unique platform has proven to be fruitful in identifying new genes and we suggest exploration of other malignancies using this approach.","['0 (DNA, Complementary)']",,,,['Haematologica. 2005 Jul;90(7):866.

DESIGN AND METHODS: A sensitive real-time PCR assay to quantify MLL-PTD transcripts was established and expression ratios assessed in diagnostic and follow-up samples. The prognostic significance of MLL-PTD expression levels was evaluated in 145 MLL-PTD positive patients at diagnosis and in 44 patients during and after treatment. RESULTS: Paired samples from 16 patients evaluated at diagnosis and relapse for the presence of the MLL-PTD were analyzed in parallel and all samples were positive at both time points. Overall, 173 samples from 44 patients were analyzed during follow-up (median sample number: 4/patient (range 2-17)). Nineteen patients were evaluable for MRD within the first 2 months, 15 patients within 4 months, and 19 patients within 6 months after the start of therapy. A >or= 2 log reduction of MLL-PTD expression in comparison to < 2 log reduction within 2, 4, and 6 months after start of therapy was found to be significantly associated with longer overall survival (p=0.029, p=0.007, and p=0.022, respectively). A molecular relapse was detected in 2 cases, in each case preceeding clinical manifestation by 35 days.

FLT3/ITD and D835 mutations were analyzed in 194 Chinese patients with acute leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). FLT3/ITDs and D835 mutations were found in 25.9 and 6.3% of 143 AML patients, respectively. Two patients showed both ITD and point mutations. Among the FAB subtypes of AML, the rate of FLT3 aberration was significantly higher in M3 and M5. However, neither aberrations was found in 25 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), 2 acute hybrid leukemia, 17 MDS and 7 chronic myeloid leukemia in blast crisis (CML-BC). FLT3/ITD was associated to leukocytosis and lower complete remission (CR) rate, and was more prevalent in patients with normal karyotype. In contrast, D835 mutation was not associated with leukocytosis or low CR rate. Our results confirm that FLT3 activating mutations also occur in a significant percentage in Chinese AML patients. FLT3/ITD(+) patients treated with standard induction regimen could achieve lower complete remission rates compared with patients not harboring this defect. Early detection of FLT3 mutations and an intensification of induction therapy might thus be useful for this group of patients to overcome the poor prognosis.",['EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)'],,20050705,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we examined the relation among CK-BB activity, expression of CKB mRNA in peripheral blood, and hypermethylation of the CKB. METHODS: The 2 patients and other 26 patients with hematologic malignancies, and some cancer cell lines were subjected to measurement of serum CK activity, CK isoenzyme analysis, CKB mRNA expression analysis by RT-PCR, and methylation analysis of the CKB promoter region. RESULTS: CK-BB activity and proportion of leukemia blasts were correlated in the 2 patients. CKB mRNA was increased in peripheral blood during an increase in leukemia blast numbers. In contrast, none of the other 26 patients showed CK-BB activity or expression of CKB mRNA. In all of the patients with hematologic disorders, the analyzed region of CKB promoter was mostly unmethylated. However, some of cancer cell lines showed the methylated pattern. CKB mRNA was expressed at higher levels in cells with an unmethylated CKB promoter than in cells with a methylated promoter. CONCLUSIONS: Expression of CKB mRNA and CK-B sometimes occurred in blastic transformation of the hematopoietic system. A relation between CKB mRNA expression and methylation of the CKB promoter was suggested.","['0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.3.2 (Creatine Kinase, BB Form)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In vitroPERV transmission to human cells is well established. Evidence from human/pig hematopoietic chimeras in immunodeficient mice suggests PERV transmission from pig to human cells in vivo. However, recently Yang et al. demonstrated in such a model that PERV-C, a nonhuman-tropic class, could be transmitted via pseudotyping by xenotropic murine leukemia virus (X-MLV). We developed a mouse pig islet xenotransplant model, where pig and human cells are located in physically separate compartments, to directly assess PERV transmission from a functional pig xenograft. X-MLV efficiently pseudotypes all three classes of PERV, including PERV-A and -B that are known to productively infect human cell lines and PERV-C that is normally not infectious for human cells. Pseudotyping also extends PERV's natural tropism to nonpermissive, nonhuman primate cells. X-MLV is activated locally by the surgical procedure involved in the tissue transplants. Thus, the presence and activation of endogenous X-MLV in immunodeficient mice limits the clinical significance of previous reports of in vivo PERV transmission from pig tissues to human cells.","['0 (DNA, Viral)']",,,,,"['DK07022-25/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI52349-03/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

No lines arose when MEK was inhibited in the absence of additional LIF stimulation, nor when additional LIF stimulation occurred in the absence of MEK inhibition. Typically for ES cell lines, CBA-derived cells contributed to chimeric mice and differentiated broadly in vitro.

We determined that the methyl transfer is rate-limiting, and steps up to and including the cysteine-cytosine covalent intermediate are in rapid equilibrium. Changes in these rapid equilibrium steps account for many of the previously described features of Dnmt1 catalysis and specificity including faster reactions with premethylated DNA versus unmethylated DNA, faster reactions with DNA in which guanine is replaced with inosine [poly(dC-dG) vs poly(dI-dC)], and 10-100-fold slower catalytic rates with Dnmt1 relative to the bacterial enzyme M.HhaI. Dnmt1 interactions with the guanine within the CpG recognition site can prevent the premature release of the target base and solvent access to the active site that could lead to mutagenic deamination. Our results suggest that the beta-elimination step following methyl transfer is not mediated by free solvent. Dnmt1 shows a kinetic lag in product formation and allosteric inhibition with unmethylated DNA that is not observed with premethylated DNA. Thus, we suggest the enzyme undergoes a slow relief from allosteric inhibition upon initiation of catalysis on unmethylated DNA. Notably, this relief from allosteric inhibition is not caused by self-activation through the initial methylation reaction, as the same effect is observed during the cytosine C(5) exchange reaction in the absence of AdoMet. We describe limitations in the Michaelis-Menten kinetic analysis of Dnmt1 and suggest alternative approaches.","['0 (DNA, Bacterial)', '0 (Polydeoxyribonucleotides)', '10028-17-8 (Tritium)', '25853-45-6 (poly d(I-C))', '29855-95-6 (poly(dC-dG))', '7LP2MPO46S (S-Adenosylmethionine)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (DNA modification methylase HhaI)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (DNA-Cytosine Methylases)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase 1)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (Dnmt1 protein, mouse)']",,,,,['GM56289/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hence for patients who are on prolonged imatinib therapy and continue to have complete cytogenetic responses, the central nervous system may become a sanctuary site. We report a patient who had a complete hematologic and cytogenetic response and presented with headache and vomiting. The MRI showed meningeal enhancement and the CSF (Cerebro Spinal Fluid) examination was positive for blasts. He was started on cranial radiotherapy and triple intrathecal chemotherapy. He showed good symptomatic improvement and cleared the blasts in the CSF. At the end of radiation, he was in complete hematological remission but had 50% marrow metaphases positive for Philadelphia chromosome. As he did not have a matched sibling donor, the dose of imatinib was increased to 600 mg daily. He continues to be in complete hematologic remission at the time of this report.","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'WI4X0X7BPJ (Hydrocortisone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",,,"['Copyright 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most reports on RIST to date are small, single-institution experiences or retrospective studies with heterogeneous patient populations and primary diseases, complicating any direct comparison between studies. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), moderate-intensity regimens may be effective, achieving 30-70% 1-year disease-free survival in various series, but minimal-intensity regimens are associated with high relapse rates. In acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), not even moderate-intensity regimens are effective and most patients with advanced ALL relapse post transplant.

Primary (i.e. nonreactive) eosinophilia is considered either ""clonal"" or ""idiopathic"" based on the presence or absence, respectively, of either a molecular or bone marrow histological evidence for a myeloid neoplasm. Clonal eosinophilia might accompany a spectrum of clinicopathological entities, the minority of whom are molecularly characterized; Fip1-like-1-platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (FIP1L1-PDGFRA(+)) systemic mastocytosis, platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta (PDGFRB)-rearranged atypical myeloproliferative disorder, chronic myeloid leukemia, and the 8p11 syndrome that is associated with fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) rearrangement. Hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) is a subcategory of idiopathic eosinophilia and is characterized by an absolute eosinophil count of > or =1.5 x 10(9)/l for at least 6 months as well as eosinophil-mediated tissue damage. At present, a working diagnosis of primary eosinophilia mandates a bone marrow examination, karyotype analysis, and additional molecular studies in order to provide the patient with accurate prognostic information as well as select appropriate therapy. For example, the presence of either PDGFRA or PDGFRB mutations warrants the use of imatinib in clonal eosinophilia. In HES, prednisone, hydroxyurea, and interferon-alpha constitute first-line therapy, whereas imatinib, cladribine, and monoclonal antibodies to either interleukin-5 (mepolizumab) or CD52 (alemtuzumab) are considered investigational.

The diagnosis of systemic MCD is most commonly established by a thorough histological and immunohistochemical examination of a bone marrow (BM) trephine specimen. In cases with pathognomonic perivascular and -trabecular aggregates of morphologically atypical MC and significant BM involvement, the diagnosis may be relatively straightforward. In contrast, when a sparse, loose pattern of MC infiltration predominates, or when MCs are obscured by an associated non-MC hematological neoplasm, a high index of suspicion and use of adjunctive tests, including special stains, such as tryptase and CD25, may be necessary to reach a diagnosis. The updated classification for MCD clarifies the clinical and pathological criteria for categorizing patients into relatively discrete subgroups. Some cases, however, such those with Fip1-like-1-platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (FIP1L1-PDGFRA)(+) clonal eosinophilia associated with elevated serum tryptase levels, with features that overlap MCD and chronic eosinophilic leukemia, may not be easy to categorize on the basis of this classification. There is no standard therapy for MCD and treatment has to be tailored to the needs of the individual patient. MC-cytoreductive therapies, such as interferon-alpha and chemotherapy, are generally reserved for patients with progressive disease and organopathy. A subset of MCD patients with associated eosinophilia who carry the FIP1L1-PDGFRA oncogene will achieve complete clinical, histological, and molecular remissions with imatinib mesylate therapy, in contrast to those with c-kit D816V mutations.

However, over the last 10 years, the study of hypereosinophilia has enjoyed a revival. This interest has been rekindled by two factors: (1) the development of increasingly sophisticated molecular biology techniques that have unmasked recurrent genetic abnormalities linked to eosinophilia, and (2) the successful application of targeted therapy with agents such as imatinib to treat eosinophilic diseases. To date, most of these recurrent molecular abnormalities have resulted in constitutively activated fusion tyrosine kinases whose phenotypic consequence is an eosinophilia-associated myeloid disorder. Most notable among these are rearrangements of platelet-derived growth factor receptors alpha and beta (PDGFRalpha, PDGFRbeta), which define a small subset of patients with eosinophilic chronic myeloproliferative disorders (MPDs) and/or overlap myelodysplastic syndrome/MPD syndromes, including chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. Discovery of the cryptic FIP1L1-PDGFRA gene fusion in cytogenetically normal patients with systemic mast cell disease with eosinophilia or idiopathic HES has redefined these diseases as clonal eosinophilias. A growing list of fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 fusion partners has similarly emerged in the 8p11 myeloproliferative syndromes, which are often characterized by elevated eosinophil counts. Herein the focus is on the molecular gains made in these MPD-type eosinophilias, and the classification and clinicopathological issues related to hypereosinophilic syndromes, including the lymphocyte variant. Success in establishing the molecular basis of a group of once seemingly heterogeneous diseases has now the laid the foundation for establishing a semi-molecular classification scheme of eosinophilic disorders.","['0 (CEP43 protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (mRNA Cleavage and Polyadenylation Factors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor alpha)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor beta)']",191,,"['Copyright (c) 2005 S.

METHODS: Analysis was conducted on data from 3 prospective trials conducted in children and adolescents with CML. Forty pediatric patients were evaluated in 16 French pediatric oncology units between 1991 and 2003. RESULTS: The disease predominately affected children who were older than 10 years (67% of the patients), with a higher prevalence in boys than girls (gender ratio: 1.5). Approximately 20% of cases were diagnosed incidentally. The main presenting symptoms were asthenia, weight loss, and complaints related to splenomegaly. Occasional patients presented with signs evocative of leukostasis. Symptoms were more common in patients with splenic enlargement, which was present in 70% of patients, and higher leukocyte counts. Markedly raised leukocyte counts were common (median white blood cell count: 242 x 10(9)/L). The age and the gender of the patients had no effect on the leukocyte count, the hemoglobin level, or the platelet count. A predominance of b3a2 transcript was observed in the 16 children who were studied for the type of chimeric BCR-ABL mRNA.

It shows that the characteristics of CML seem to differ in children compared with previously published adult series; in particular, the presenting leukocyte counts are often higher in children.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, these studies are cross-sectional, and no longitudinal data are available in a large group of patients after completion of therapy. In the present study, 1-year longitudinal changes in BMD, body composition, and bone metabolism were evaluated in children with ALL during the first 3 years after completion of therapy without cranial irradiation. METHODS: BMD of total body (TB; g/cm(2)), areal and apparent volumetric lumbar spine (L2-L4), lean body mass, and percentage of body fat were measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry in 37 children (median age: 7.9 years; range: 4.7-20.6 years) who were treated for ALL at a median age of 3.3 years (range: 1.1-16.6 years), after a median time of 2.2 years after the completion of treatment, and after a 1-year follow-up period. Two control subjects (n = 74) who were matched for gender, age, and pubertal stage were also longitudinally investigated for body composition for 1 year. Usual serum biochemical markers of calcium metabolism and bone turnover were measured in patients during the study period. RESULTS: A slight decrease in TB BMD was found after a median time of 2.2 years after the completion of therapy for ALL in childhood. Patients showed a significantly lower median TB BMD when evaluated <1.5 years as compared with those at >or=1.5 years since completion of therapy. At the time of first evaluation, the percentage of body fat mass was significantly higher and patients were physically less active than their matched control subjects. Although, as expected, during the 1 year of follow-up both groups showed an annual increment in their BMD measurements, a significantly higher increase in TB BMD was observed in patients in comparison with control subjects. During this same period, the increase in the percentage of body fat mass was slightly lower in ALL patients as compared with control subjects. At the end of the follow-up year, BMD, body-composition parameters, and physical activity of ALL patients were similar to those observed in matched control subjects. Serum biochemical markers of bone turnover were normal at both evaluations. CONCLUSIONS: A significant increase in TB BMD and a tendency to a lesser increase in percentage of body fat mass were observed during the study period in ALL patients as compared with chronological age-, gender-, and pubertal stage-matched control subjects. These findings suggest a positive effect of long-term completion therapy and increase in physical activity on BMD, body composition, and bone metabolism in patients who have been treated for ALL.",['SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MYC encodes an oncogenic transcription factor, of which target genes presumably contribute to cellular transformation. Although Myc regulates about 15% of genes and combinations of target genes are likely required for tumorigenesis, we studied in depth the expression of the Myc target gene, JPO1/CDCA7, in human cancers and its ability to provoke tumorigenesis in transgenic mice. JPO1/CDCA7 is frequently overexpressed in human cancers, and in particular, its expression is highly elevated in chronic myelogenous leukemia blast crisis as compared with the chronic phase. In murine lymphoid tissues, ectopic human JPO1/CDCA7 expression resulted in a 2-fold increased risk of lymphoid malignancies at 1 year. The transgene, which was driven by the H2-K promoter, exhibited leaky expression in nonlymphoid tissues such as kidney. We observed a significant increased incidence of transgenic animal solid tumors, which were not seen in littermate controls. These observations suggest that JPO1/CDCA7 may contribute to Myc-mediated tumorigenesis.","['0 (CDCA7 protein, human)', '0 (MYC protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)']",,,,,"['CA57341/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA006973/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA057341/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA057341-13/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'RR00171/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'CA51497/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA051497/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA051497/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5 P30 CA06973/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA051497-16/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K26 RR000171/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",PMC1224734,,,['NIHMS2162'],,,,,,,,,,,

We found that, in IKKalpha-/-, IKKbeta-/-, and IKKgamma-/- MEFs, p53 activation of a prototypic responsive plasmid (pG13-luciferase) was repressed by wild-type Tax. Curiously, p53's activity in MEFs was also repressed by a p300/CBP-binding deficient Tax protein.

In the first, binding of the virus particle to its cognate receptor is followed by fusion and internalization. The second, less common mechanism requires the addition of an accessory protein in order to achieve fusion and entry into the target cells; this protein is usually the soluble form of the envelope protein containing the receptor-binding domain (RBD). For some viruses, such as amphotropic murine leukemia virus (A-MLV), particles with fusion-defective envelope proteins can enter cells in the presence of their own RBD or that of another viral envelope, regardless of its cognate receptor, suggesting that these viruses share a common entry mechanism. A notable exception is gibbon ape leukemia virus (GALV). Fusion-impaired GALV envelope mutants can be trans-activated for infectivity only by GALV RBDs.

The B30.2/SPRY domain and an additional domain in huTRIM5alpha, comprising the amino-terminal RING and B-box components of the TRIM motif, are required for N-MLV restriction activity, while the intervening coiled-coil domain is necessary and sufficient for huTRIM5alpha multimerization. Truncated huTRIM5alpha proteins that lack either or both the N-terminal RING/B-Box or the C-terminal B30.2/SPRY domain form heteromultimers with full-length huTRIM5alpha and are dominant inhibitors of its N-MLV restricting activity, suggesting that homomultimerization of intact huTRIM5alpha monomers is necessary for N-MLV restriction.

Obesity, particularly abdominal obesity, is one of the main characteristics of the metabolic syndrome and a risk factor for cardiovascular disease and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). DESIGN: All patients treated for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) before the onset of puberty in the region of western Sweden, between 1973 and 1985, and in first remission, were included. 35 out of 47 patients aged 20-32 years participated. 19 patients had received cranial radiotherapy, and the median follow-up time was 20 years. The focus of this report was to study body composition and signs of the metabolic syndrome and correlate the findings to spontaneous growth hormone (GH) secretion. METHODS: Body composition was assessed using dual-energy X-ray absorbtiometry (DEXA). We analyzed serum concentrations of insulin, glucose, leptin and lipids. RESULTS: No patient was obese according to World Health Organization criteria (body mass index, BMI > or = 30 kg/m2) but one-third were overweight (BMI 25-29.9 kg/m2). The maximal GH peak during 24 h (GHmax) was correlated to percentage of total body fat (r = -0.42; P = 0.017), trunk fat (r = -0.5; P = 0.005) and fat-free mass (r = 0.42; P = 0.017). GHmax was also correlated to s-triglycerides (r = -0.54; P = 0.001), low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (r = -0.382; P = 0.024) and high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (r = 0.45; P = 0.007). CONCLUSIONS: We found little effect on BMI but an increased percentage of total body fat, especially trunk fat, and a tendency for an unfavourable lipid profile in adult survivors of childhood leukaemia. These findings were related to low endogenous GH secretion due to cranial irradiation.","['0 (Leptin)', '0 (Lipids)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Themes on the students' reasoning behind their decision to tell the patient or not were also identified. RESULTS: Unlike other vignettes of the EHCI in which autonomy was a main theme, few students chose the consensus answer before year 1 and there was no significant movement towards consensus at any point during the course. In defence of their decision to withhold information, the students expressed strong paternalistic opinions. The patient's age was seen as a barrier to respecting her autonomy. CONCLUSIONS: It is important to identify students' perceptions on entry to medical school. Transformative learning theory may provide the basis for an approach to foster doctors who consider the rights of young people. Small-group teaching is most conducive to this approach. The importance of positive role modelling is also emphasised.",,,,,,,PMC1734176,,,,,['KIE: 125415'],['KIE'],"['Empirical Approach', 'Professional Patient Relationship']","['KIE: 46 refs.', 'KIE: KIE Bib: medical ethics/education; truth disclosure']",,,,,,

Epub 2005 Jun 30.,"Translocations of the genes encoding the related transcription factors TFE3 and TFEB are almost exclusively associated with a rare juvenile subset of renal cell carcinoma and lead to overexpression of TFE3 or TFEB protein sequences. A better understanding of how deregulated TFE3 and TFEB contribute to the transformation process requires elucidating more of the normal cellular processes in which they participate. Here we identify TFE3 and TFEB as cell type-specific leukemia inhibitory factor-responsive activators of E-cadherin. Overexpression of TFE3 or TFEB in 3T3 cells activated endogenous and reporter E-cadherin expression. Conversely, endogenous TFE3 and/or TFEB was required for endogenous E-cadherin expression in primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts and human embryonic kidney cells. Chromatin precipitation analyses and E-cadherin promoter reporter gene assays revealed that E-cadherin induction by TFE3 or TFEB was primarily or exclusively direct and mitogen-activated protein kinase-dependent in those cell types. In mouse embryonic fibroblasts, TFE3 and TFEB activation of E-cadherin was responsive to leukemia inhibitory factor. In 3T3 cells, TFE3 and TFEB expression also induced expression of Wilms' tumor-1, another E-cadherin activator. In contrast, E-cadherin expression in model mouse and canine renal epithelial cell lines was indifferent to inhibition of endogenous TFE3 and/or TFEB and was reduced by TFE3 or TFEB overexpression. These results reveal new cell type-specific activities of TFE3 and TFEB which may be affected by their mutation.","['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (Cadherins)', '0 (Chromatin)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (TFE3 protein, human)', '0 (TFEB protein, human)', '0 (Tcfeb protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)', '136896-33-8 (Tcfe3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)']",,20050630,,,['R21 DK065011-02/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2005 Jun 30.,"Transcriptional control has been identified as a key mechanism regulating the formation and subsequent behavior of hematopoietic stem cells. We have used a comparative genomics approach to identify transcriptional regulatory elements of the LMO2 gene, a transcriptional cofactor originally identified through its involvement in T-cell leukemia and subsequently shown to be critical for normal hematopoietic and endothelial development. Of the 2 previously characterized LMO2 promoters, the second (proximal) promoter was highly conserved in vertebrates ranging from mammals to fish. Real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) expression analysis identified this promoter as the predominant source of transcription in hematopoietic tissue. Transient and stable transfections indicated that the proximal promoter was active in hematopoietic progenitor and endothelial cell lines and this activity was shown to depend on 3 conserved Ets sites that were bound in vivo by E74-like factor 1 (Elf1), Friend leukemia integration 1 (Fli1), and erythroblastosis virus oncogene homolog E twenty-six-1 (Ets1). Finally, transgenic analysis demonstrated that the LMO2 proximal promoter is sufficient for expression in endothelial cells in vivo. No hematopoietic expression was observed, indicating that additional enhancers are required to mediate transcription from the proximal promoter in hematopoietic cells. Together, these results suggest that the conserved proximal promoter is central to LMO2 transcription in hematopoietic and endothelial cells, where it is regulated by Ets factors.","['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (ETS1 protein, human)', '0 (Ephrin-A2)', '0 (Ets1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Ets1 protein, rat)', '0 (Fli1 protein, mouse)', '0 (LIM Domain Proteins)', '0 (LMO2 protein, human)', '0 (Lmo2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Metalloproteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Protein c-ets-1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Protein c-fli-1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",,20050630,,,['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients in complete remission were then given 1 consolidation cycle without PSC-833. Neither complete response (CR) rate (54% versus 48%; P = .22), 5-year EFS (7% versus 8%; P = .53), disease-free survival (DFS; 13% versus 17%; P = .06) nor overall survival (OS; 10% in both arms; P = .52) were significantly improved in the PSC-833 arm. An integrated P-gp score (IPS) was determined based on P-gp function and P-gp expression in AML cells obtained prior to treatment. A higher IPS was associated with a significantly lower CR rate and worse EFS and OS. There was no significant interaction between IPS and treatment arm with respect to CR rate and survival, indicating also a lack of benefit of PSC-833 in P-gp-positive patients.

Epub 2005 Jun 30.,"Recently, somatic mutations of the nucleophosmin gene (NPM1), which alter the subcellular localization of the product, have been reported in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We analyzed the clinical significance of NPM1 mutations in comparison with cytogenetics, FLT3, NRAS, and TP53 mutations, and a partial tandem duplication of the MLL gene (MLL-TD) in 257 patients with AML. We found NPM1 mutations, including 4 novel sequence variants, in 64 of 257 (24.9%) patients. NPM1 mutations were associated with normal karyotype and with internal tandem duplication (ITD) and D835 mutations in FLT3, but not with other mutations. In 190 patients without the M3 French-American-British (FAB) subtype who were treated with the protocol of the Japan Adult Leukemia Study Group, multivariate analyses showed that the NPM1 mutation was a favorable factor for achieving complete remission but was associated with a high relapse rate. Sequential analysis using 39 paired samples obtained at diagnosis and relapse showed that NPM1 mutations were lost at relapse in 2 of the 17 patients who had NPM1 mutations at diagnosis. These results suggest that the NPM1 mutation is not necessarily an early event during leukemogenesis or that leukemia clones with NPM1 mutations are sensitive to chemotherapy.","['0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)']",,20050630,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We compared three HER2 laboratory methods: immunohistochemistry (IHC), fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR), to predict disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) after adjuvant doxorubicin-based therapy in node-positive breast cancer patients. METHODS: This is a Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) study, using 524 tumor blocks collected from breast cancer patients registered to clinical trial CALGB 8541. IHC employed CB11 and AO-11-854 monoclonal antibodies; FISH used PathVysion HER2 DNA Probe kit; PCR utilized differential PCR (D-PCR) methodology. RESULTS: Cases HER2 positive by IHC, FISH and D-PCR were 24%, 17%, and 18%, respectively. FISH and IHC were clearly related (kappa = 64.8%). All three methods demonstrated a similar relationship for DFS and OS. By any method, for patients with HER2-negative tumors, there was little or no effect of dose of adjuvant doxorubicin-based therapy. For patients with HER2-positive tumors, all three methods predicted a benefit from dose-intense (high-dose) compared with low- or moderate-dose adjuvant doxorubicin-based therapy. CONCLUSION: FISH is a reliable method to predict clinical outcome following adjuvant doxorubicin-based therapy for stage II breast cancer patients. There is a moderate level of concordance among the three methods (IHC, FISH, PCR). None of the methods is clearly superior. Although IHC-positive/FISH-positive tumors yielded the greatest interaction with dose of therapy in predicting outcome, no combination of assays tested was statistically superior.","['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, ErbB-2)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)', 'CAF protocol']",,,,,"['CA02599/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA03927/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA04326/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA04457/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA07968/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA08025/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA11789/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA12046/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA12449/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA21060/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA25119/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA26806/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA31809/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA31946/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA31983/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA32291/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA33601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA35279/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA35406/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA35421/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA37135/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA37447/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA41287/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA45374/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA45389/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA45418/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA45564/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA45808/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA47545/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA47555/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA47559/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA47577/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA47642/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA54697/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA77440/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA77651/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'NCI-U01-CA64061-05/CI/NCPDCID CDC HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The bacterial DNA was extracted using a modified soil extraction protocol. Amplification of 16S rDNA was carried out using primers specific for eubacteria and enterobacteriaceae. Fingerprints of 200/370 bp respectively were obtained by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis following PCR and nested PCR amplification. In parallel to DGGE analysis, clone libraries containing PCR fragments of the ribosomal gene were constructed and clones were screened by DGGE. DGGE analysis indicated a high diversity of bacterial communities in salad samples. Fingerprints indicated clearly reduced diversity of bacterial communities in processed samples from markets compared to field-grown salads. Surprisingly, primers pointed out in literature as specific for enterobacteriaceae did amplify pseudomonadeceae as well. Therefore, the more specific primers fD2 and rP1 were used subsequently in this study to amplify specific members of the family enterobacteriaceae. A total of 11 different 16S rDNA sequences were obtained and subjected to sequencing and phylogenetic affiliation. Sequences derived from the eubacterial clone library from organically farmed salad were affiliated to the family microbacteriaceae and pseudomonadaceae. In addition, a potential new genus within the family of enterobacteriaceae was detected. Furthermore, a sequence showing 98.9% similarity to Pseudomonas libaniensis (fluorescence subgroup) was found in a processed salad sample but not in the corresponding field samples. This species is generally known as an opportunistic pathogen. Whereas molecular based monitoring of bacterial communities in food still may need more experience and standardisation to detect specific bacteria present, the monitoring strategy presented in this paper, combining DGGE analysis with the construction of clone libraries, is an attractive method for culture-independent monitoring of changes of bacterial communities in the food chain.","['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Bacterial)', '0 (RNA, Bacterial)', '0 (RNA, Ribosomal, 16S)', 'EN464416SI (Ethidium)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent studies showed greater potency with DC/tumor fusion vaccines against acute myeloid leukemia and melanoma compared with lysate-pulsed DC vaccines. We compared these two vaccine strategies against murine colon cancer and investigated whether DC/tumor fusion cells continue to produce tumor antigens following fusion as a possible explanation for their increased potency. Using a mouse colon cancer model, CT26, we first showed that the DC/CT26 fusion vaccine is more effective in preventing tumor implantation than CT26 lysate-pulsed DC vaccine. Next, CT26 made to constitutively produce bioactive TGF-beta, a surrogate of tumor-derived products, was fused to DCs and found to produce bioactive TGF-beta 72 h after fusion. Our results suggest the DC/tumor fusion vaccine is more potent against colon cancer than the lysate-pulsed DC vaccine.

The proliferative response of PBMC isolated from those cattle with PL in the presence of recombinant bovine TNF-alpha (rTNF-alpha) was significantly higher than those from AL cattle and uninfected cattle and the cells from PL cattle expressed significantly higher mRNA levels of TNF receptor type II (TNF-RII) than those from AL and BLV-uninfected cattle. No difference was found in TNF-RI mRNA levels. Most cells expressing TNF-RII in PL cattle were CD5+ or sIgM+ cells and these cells showed resistance to TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis. Additionally, there were significant positive correlations between the changes in provirus load and TNF-RII mRNA levels, and TNF-alpha-induced proliferation and TNF-RII mRNA levels. These data suggest that imbalance in the expression of TNF receptors could at least in part contribute to the progression of lymphocytosis in BLV infection.","['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Studies using mutant forms of BCR-ABL demonstrated that the BCR-ABL-induced OPN overexpression was a tyrosine kinase-dependent event. Furthermore, OPN concentration was significantly increased in the serum of leukemic mice generated by transplantation of BCR-ABL-expressing bone marrow cells. Most importantly, a significant increase of OPN concentration was observed in the serum of CML patients as compared to controls.

In this study, we isolated three compounds which induce granulocytic differentiation evaluated by nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT)-reducing assays from the water extract of propolis and identified as 4,5-di-O-caffeoylquinic, 3,5-di-O-caffeoylquinic, and 3,4-di-O-caffeoylquinic acids by NMR analysis. Cell growth inhibitory activity of these caffeoylquinic acids was found in HL-60 cell, which was mainly attributed to the induction of apoptosis. Furthermore, the potency of caffeoylquinic acid derivatives to induce granulocytic differentiation was examined in HL-60 cells. Caffeic, quinic, and chlorogenic acids had no effects on the NBT-reducing activity, while 3,4,5-tri-O-caffeoylquinic acid induced more than 30% of NBT-positive cells. These results suggest that the number of the caffeoyl groups bound to quinic acid plays an important role in the potency of the caffeoylquinic acid derivatives to induce granulocytic differentiation. This is the first report demonstrating that the caffeoylquinic acid derivatives induce granulocytic differentiation of HL-60 cells.","['0 (caffeoylquinic acid)', '058C04BGYI (Quinic Acid)', '9009-62-5 (Propolis)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2005 Jun 29.,"Protein kinase C (PKC) plays an important role in the proliferation and differentiation of various cell types including normal and leukemic hematopoietic cells. Phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu) induces the megakaryocytic differentiation of K562 human erythroleukemia cells through PKC activation. Decursin, a pyranocoumarin from Angelica gigas, exhibits the cytotoxic effects on various human cancer cell lines and in vitro PKC activation. We report here the differences between two PKC activators, tumor-suppressing decursin and tumor-promoting PDBu, in their actions on the megakaryocytic differentiation of K562 cells. First of all, decursin inhibited PDBu-induced bleb formation in K562 cells. Decursin also inhibited the PDBu-induced megakaryocytic differentiation of K562 cells that is characterized by an increase in substrate adhesion, the secretion of granulocyte/macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), and the surface expression of integrin beta3. The binding of PDBu to PKC was competitively inhibited by decursin. Decursin induced the more rapid down-regulation of PKC alpha and betaII isozymes than that induced by PDBu in K562 cells. Unlike PDBu, decursin promoted the translocation of PKC alpha and betaII to the nuclear membrane. Decursin-induced faster down-regulation and nuclear translocation of PKC alpha and betaII were not affected by the presence of PDBu. All these results indicate that decursin and phorbol ester are PKC activators distinctively acting in megakaryocytic differentiation and PKC modulation in K562 leukemia cells.","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzopyrans)', '0 (Butyrates)', '0 (Pyranocoumarins)', '37558-16-0 (Phorbol 12,13-Dibutyrate)', 'E95RTO3YQR (decursin)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)']",,20050629,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, different molecular datasets do not agree on a single history of the taxa, probably because of marker-specific biases. The 'total-evidence' approach maximizes character congruence, but may be biased by a single robust, but non-phylogenetic constraint from one dataset. We have therefore taken the approach to analyse also each dataset separately prior to their combination, and detect repeated groups: signal common to markers is more probably a reflection of shared ancestry than marker-specific signal. Partial sequences (678+527 base pairs) of exons of the MLL gene (Mixed Lineage Leukaemia-like) gene were used, as well as the datasets of Chen et al. (ribosomal 28S, rhodopsin gene, mitochondrial 12S and 16S). Most of the repeated clades of Chen et al. are supported by the new dataset. Some new groups were repeatedly found: a Scarus-Labrus group (clade M), the presence of Gasterosteidae as a sister taxon or within the clade Zoarcoidei-Cottoidei (clade Is), Polymixia as a sister-group to the clade Zeoidei-Gadiformes (clade O), the clade Q grouping Mugiloidei, Cichlidae, Atherinomorpha, Blennioidei and Gobiesocoidei; and the interesting clade N, reducing potential sister-groups to Tetraodontiformes to either Caproidei, Lophiiformes, Acanthuroidei, Drepanidae, Chaetodontidae, and Pomacanthidae.",['0 (DNA Primers)'],,,,,,,['C R Biol. 2005 Oct-Nov;328(10-11):1031-2'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we report that the fission yeast homolog of the human transcription factor EAP30, Dot2, negatively regulates meiotic spindle pole body (SPB, the yeast equivalent of centrosome) maturation. dot2 mutants show excess electron-dense material accumulating near SPBs, which we refer to as aberrant microtubule organization centers (AMtOCs). These AMtOCs assemble multipolar spindles, leading to chromosome missegregation. SPB aberrations were associated with elevated levels of Pcp1, the fission yeast ortholog of pericentrin/kentrin, and reducing pcp1(+) expression significantly suppressed AMtOCs in dot2-439 cells. Our findings, therefore, uncover meiosis-specific regulation of SPB maturation and provide evidence that a member of the conserved EAP30 family is required for maintenance of genome stability through regulation of SPB maturation. EAP30 is part of a transcription factor complex associated with acute myeloid leukemia, so these results may have relevance to human cancer.","['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Dot2 protein, S pombe)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Schizosaccharomyces pombe Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (pcp1 protein, S pombe)']",,,,,"['F32 GM66490-01/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM48547/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,['Dev Cell. 2005 Sep;9(3):439'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Leachates emanating from municipal wastes are a major source of surface and groundwater pollution worldwide. Globally, leachates have been implicated in low yield of farm produce, developmental anomalies, low birth weights, leukemia incidence, and other cancers in communities around the site. They have also been implicated in hazards to the environment, loss of biodiversity, and contamination of water sources. At Aba-Eku in Nigeria, leachates are being discharged into the Omi Stream without treatment. A study was conducted on a method of leachate treatment that passes the leachate through constructed wetlands using Ipomoea aquatica (Forsk), a locally available plant found close to the landfill site. The aim of the study was to evolve a sustainable and cost-effective method of treatment whose effluents can be discharged into the Omi Stream with no or minimal impact. The study was descriptive and analytical in design. Samples were collected and analyzed with standard methods for pH, suspended solids (SS), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD), ammonia, nitrate, and trace metals. Raw leachates were turbid and amber in color and contained suspended solids (197.5 mg/L), ammonia (610.9 mg/L), lead (1.64 mg/L), iron (198.10 mg/L), and manganese (23.20 mg/L). When the leachates were passed through the constructed wetland with eight hours' detention time, effluents showed significant reductions in suspended solids (81.01 percent), BOD (86.03 percent), and ammonia (97.77 percent). The study shows that a constructed wetland is a feasible tool for the treatment of leachates before their disposal into the environment in Nigeria and can help safeguard environmental quality.","['0 (Metals, Heavy)', '0 (Nitrates)', '0 (Phosphates)', '0 (Water Pollutants, Chemical)', '7664-41-7 (Ammonia)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We explored the relationships between sex, pubertal development and type of neoplastic disease. 85 children (53 boys) with newly diagnosed neoplasms: 48 with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), 13 with Hodgkin's disease and 22 with solid tumors (group I) and 111 healthy children (group II) were studied. We measured in plasma: 1. bone specific alkaline phosphatase (BALP), 2. osteocalcin (OST) as the markers of bone formation and 3. ICTP (cross-linked telopeptide of type 1 collagen), 4. parathormon (PTH), as the markers of bone resorption. RESULTS: 1. In the group of boys with neoplasms osteocalcin and BALP values were lower than in healthy boys: OST 51.2 ng/ml +/- 35.3 vs 85.8 ng/ml +/- 35.96, p < 0.0001, BALP 105.6 U/L +/- 56.8, p < 0.0001. The girls had lowered values of osteocalcin (45.55 ng/ml +/- 40.9 vs 71.94 ng/ml +/- 28.75, p < 0.0008) and ICTP (11.25 U/L +/- 3.38 vs 15,47 U/L +/- 5.33, p < 0.0016). The differences were also observed in comparison with the pubertal stage except for the boys in V0Tanner stage. 2. The values of OST and BALP were lower in children with ALL than in the children with solid tumours (p < 0.01). The values of ICTP did not depend on the type of disease, sex and pubertal stage, except the children before puberty. 3. In all group we found the correlation between OST and ICTP (r = 0.45, p < 0.05), BALP and ICTP (r = 0.45, p < 0.05). This correlation was observed in children with leukaemia (r = 0.55, p < 0.05), especially in girls (r = 0.9, p < 0.05).

Diagnosis was deemed valid, after consultation of clinical records, in more than 90% of the 7264 collected cases. The number of newly diagnosed cases by year more than doubled during the 20-year period investigated. This striking increase can be only partially accounted for by ageing of population. Indeed, age-specific and age-adjusted rates of most of HM increased during this period, although Hodgkin Disease (HD), Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) and Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) were notable exceptions. The observed increase in rates is likely, in a large part, to be fictitious, due to easier access to a health care system, which in the meantime, improved its diagnostic efficiency. This was particularly evident for Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL), Multiple Myeloma (MM) and some others myelo- and lympho-proliferative disorders, but its relevance declined after 1984-1989. A likely true increase in occurrence was evidenced for Non-Hodgkin Lymphomas (NHL) and similarly, although to a lesser extent and more doubtful, for Myelodysplasias (MDS) and Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML). At the end of the studied period each type of HM presented age and sex distributions and age-adjusted rates that show only minor differences from those reported for other western countries. No argument emerged to suggest that any genetic peculiarities of the Sardinian population might have affected the occurrence of HM. The confounding effects of improved diagnostic efficiency have prevented a reliable assessment of influence on incidences of environmental and socio-economic changes that, in relatively recent times, have occurred in Sardinia.",,,,"['Copyright 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2005 Jul 1.,"It is an open question to what extent neuroprotective mechanisms involving neurotrophic proteins are activated after central nervous system (CNS) lesions. Results from previous studies have indicated that ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) and other members of the family of gp130-associated cytokines have neuroprotective effects on septohippocampal projection neurons axotomized by fimbria-fornix transection (FFT). Here we demonstrate that the transcription factor STAT3, a component of the primary cytokine signal transduction pathway, is transiently activated after FFT in the medial septum and in the lateral septum deafferented by the lesion. Immunocytochemical double-labeling showed nuclear signals for phosphorylated STAT3 in both types (GABAergic and cholinergic) of axotomized medial septal neurons around day 4 postlesion. This response temporally coincided with the cell-type-specific upregulation of the cytokine receptor components CNTF receptor alpha and LIF receptor beta in the same neurons. However, neuronal STAT3-activation was not abolished in CNTF- or LIF-deficient mouse mutants. Furthermore, lesion-induced STAT3 signaling was also found in reactive GFAP-positive astrocytes of the medial and lateral septum. Interestingly, basal GFAP expression was reduced but postlesional upregulation was markedly enhanced in CNTF(-/-) animals. These results demonstrate transient activation of cytokine signaling after CNS lesion and suggest that gp130-associated cytokines have multiple functions in the lesioned CNS by directly acting on axotomized neurons and on reactive astrocytes.","['0 (Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Contactins)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Neural Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', '56-12-2 (gamma-Aminobutyric Acid)']",,20050701,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2005 Nov 12.,"Myeloperoxidase (MPO) cytochemical activity, recognized as a very important hallmark of myeloblasts, is generally negative in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) blast crisis (BC). Because this finding is unexpected, being not in keeping with the myeloproliferative nature of CML, we tried to ascertain if MPO cytochemical negativity could be an intrinsic property of blasts of CML and hence present in the preblastic phases as well. Myeloperoxidase cytochemistry of peripheral blood blasts in 161 cases of CML, including 103 in chronic phase (CP) and 29 each in accelerated phase (AP) and BC, was assessed and compared with that of 30 cases of acute myeloid leukemia, AML-M2. Blasts of 97 (94.2%) of 103 cases of CP, 28 (96.6%) of 29 cases of AP, and 22 (75.9%) of 29 cases of BC were negative for MPO (<3% MPO-positive blasts). Compared with the strong MPO positivity, both in terms of intensity and proportion, in the AML-M2 cases, the positivity in the CML cases was generally weak and was seen in a small number of blasts (5-15%), except in one case of BC with 20% positive blasts. Absence or, at times, weak MPO cytochemical activity is an intrinsic property of blasts of all phases of CML, and use of the term myeloblast in CML should be understood to refer to a cell with this property. This also explains why MPO cytochemistry, despite its high reputation as a myeloid-lineage marker, generally does not help in CML BC. CML BC should therefore be considered as a possible diagnosis along with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, AML-M0, AML-M7, etc., in the setting of MPO-negative blasts. Similarity between MPO expression pattern in CML, i.e., negative in blasts and positive in the more mature cells, and that during maturation of normal myeloid series of cells shows the deranged myelopoiesis of CML to be undisturbed at least with respect to MPO expression. There is need for a more comprehensive study of blasts of preblastic phases.","['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', 'EC 1.11.1.7 (Peroxidase)']",,20051112,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

(1) There was no significant impact of postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy based on meta-analysis and previous clinical trials. (2) Confirmatory studies are necessary in large-scale prospective clinical trials. However, recent mega trials have introduced epoch-making changes for postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy in clinical practice since ASCO 2003. The effectiveness of UFT in N0 patients was confirmed. Patients with completely resected stage I non-small cell lung cancer, especially T2N0 adenocarcinoma, will benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy with UFT. The results of the International Adjuvant Lung Trial (IALT) have confirmed the meta-analysis in 1995. Also, both the JBR10 and Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) 9633 studies have also confirmed positive IALT results of the benefit for postoperative platinum-based chemotherapy in completely resected non-small cell lung cancer. Adjuvant chemotherapy for pathological stage IB to II, completely resected non-small cell lung cancer is standard care based on clinical trials. UFT showed the strongest evidence for IB in Japan.

Adjuvant chemotherapy should be offered as standard care to patients after completely resected early stage non-small cell lung cancer. However, there is no evidence of the feasibility and efficacy for adjuvant chemotherapy with the platinum-based regimen in Japan. Careful management should be necessary in such treatment.",['Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)'],19,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The conditioning regimen was based on cyclophosphamide associated with either total body irradiation (TBI) (37 patients) or with busulfan (63 patients). Graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) prophylaxis consisted of cyclosporin and methotrexate in the majority of the patients. Fifteen year overall survival was estimated at 53% (95% confidence interval (CI), 44-65) with a plateau after 2.5 years. Long-term survival was adversely affected by: longer time from chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) diagnosis to transplantation, older age at time of transplantation and GvHD (acute grade III-IV or chronic extensive). The main cause of death was infection, related to GvHD in 69% of patients. Splenectomy also significantly increased the risk of bacterial infection. 15-year relapse was estimated at 8% (95% CI, 0.1-14). Late malignancies occurred in seven patients, four of whom had an invasive cancer. Other frequent late complications included cataracts, psychological depression, osteonecrosis and hypothyroidism. These complications were more frequent following splenectomy, TBI and in patients with chronic extensive GvHD. We conclude that allogeneic transplantation with a related donor can cure more than half of CML patients in chronic phase, although physicians should be alert to long-term complications.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we assessed ALK+ and ALK- ALCL tumors for p53 gene alterations using PCR, single-strand conformation polymorphism and direct sequencing methods. We also immunohistochemically assessed ALCL tumors for p53 expression. Three of 36 (8%) ALCL tumors (1/14 ALK+, 2/22 ALK-) with adequate DNA showed p53 gene mutations. By contrast, p53 was overexpressed in 36 of 55 (65%) ALCL tumors (16 ALK+, 20 ALK-). p21, a target of p53, was expressed in 15 of 31 (48%) ALCL tumors including seven of 15 (47%) p53-positive tumors. p21 expression in a subset of ALCL suggests the presence of functional p53 protein. Apoptotic rate was significantly higher in p53-positive than p53-negative tumors (mean 2.78 vs 0.91%, P = 0.0003). We conclude that the p53 gene is rarely mutated in ALK+ and ALK- ALCL tumors.

This is the first report on a clinical vaccination study with DCs for patients with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL). The potential of allogeneic DCs pulsed ex vivo with tumor cell lysates or apoptotic bodies to stimulate antitumor immunity in patients with B-CLL in early stages was evaluated. Monocyte-derived DCs were obtained from unrelated healthy donors. Nine patients (clinical stage 0 and 1 according to Rai) were vaccinated five times with a mean number of 32 x 10(6) stimulated DCs administered intradermally once every 2-3 weeks. No signs of autoimmunity were detected, and only mild local skin reactions were noted. During the treatment period, we observed a decrease of peripheral blood leukocytes and CD19+/CD5+ leukemic cells. In one patient, a significant increase of specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes against RHAMM/CD168, a recently characterized leukemia-associated antigen, could be detected after DC vaccination. Taken together, the study demonstrated that DC vaccination in CLL patients is feasible and safe.

While karyotype alterations, in addition to the Philadelphia chromosome, are a common phenomenon of progressing CML, the observation of BCR-ABL-negative leukemic clones with distinct aberrant karyotypes under an imatinib regimen is not yet understood. Here we test the hypothesis that such tumor clones may be induced de novo from normal cells by imatinib. In vitro experiments with varying drug concentrations (5-20 microM) were performed on normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDF), Chinese hamster embryonal and Indian muntjak fibroblasts. After 3 weeks of treatment, analysis of cell cultures by centrosome immunostaining and conventional cytogenetics revealed that imatinib induced centrosome and chromosome aberrations in all cultures in a significant dose-dependent and species-independent manner. Moreover, the results of NHDF long-term culture experiments demonstrated that aberrant phenotypes, emerging under imatinib treatment for 12 weeks, were not reversible after prolonged propagation omitting the drug. These observations suggest a causative role of imatinib in the origin of centrosome and karyotype aberrations (genetic instability) and thus may explain the emergence of clonal chromosomal abnormalities in BCR-ABL-negative progenitor cells under imatinib therapy.","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We previously identified the human oncogenic germ line mutant KIT(K642E), a substitution in the tyrosine kinase 1 domain (TK1D) in a familial form of gastrointestinal stromal tumors. The effects of oncogenic KIT mutants on cell signaling and regulation are complex. Cellular models are valuable basic tools to tailor novel strategies on specific cellular and molecular bases for tumors expressing KIT oncogenic mutants. Murine KIT(WT) and the murine homologues of human KIT oncogenic mutants, further referred to as KIT(K641E) and KIT(del559), a point deletion in the juxtamembrane domain (JMD), were stably expressed in IL-3-dependent Ba/F3 cells. Major differences in the constitutively activation of Akt/PKB, MAP kinases and STATs pathways were observed between KIT(K641E) and KIT(del559), whereas KIT ligand elicited responses in both mutants. Noteworthy, the protein level of the phosphoinositide phosphatase SHIP1, but not SHIP2 and PTEN, was reduced in KIT(K641E) only while inhibition of KIT phosphorylation reversibly raised SHIP1 level in both JMD and TK1D oncogenic mutants, unraveling the control of SHIP protein level by KIT phosphorylation.","['EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.1.3.56 (Inositol Polyphosphate 5-Phosphatases)', 'EC 3.1.3.86 (INPP5D protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.86 (Inpp5d protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.1.3.86 (Inppl1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.1.3.86 (Phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-Trisphosphate 5-Phosphatases)']",,20050628,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cytotoxicity is caused by the derived compounds 6-thioguanine nucleotides (TGNs) and methyl-6-thioinosine monophosphate (methylthio-IMP). The 6-thiopurine mononucleotides 6-thio-IMP (thio-IMP), 6-thio-GMP (thio-GMP) and methylthio-IMP can be catabolized by purine 5'-nucleotidase. It has been shown that the various 5'-nucleotidases are key enzymes for (6-thio)-purine metabolism. We aimed to investigate whether the overall 5'-nucleotidase (5'NT) activity is correlated with the efficacy and toxicity of 6-thiopurine nucleotides. Substrate affinity of 5'NT for IMP, GMP, AMP, thio-IMP, thio-GMP and methylthio-IMP was studied in human lymphocytes. For each of the substrates, the pH for optimal overall enzyme activity has been determined at a pH range between 6 and 10. At the optimal pH, assays were performed to establish Km and Vmax values. Optimal pH values for the various substrates were between 7 and 8.5. Km values ranged from 33 to 109 microM, Vmax ranged from 3.99 to 19.5 nmol/10(6) peripheral mononuclear cells (pMNC) h, and Vmax/Km ratios ranged from 105 to 250. The results did not show a distinct preference of 5'NT activity for any of the tested thiopurine nucleotides. The enzyme kinetic studies furthermore revealed substrate inhibition by thio-IMP and thio-GMP as a substrate. Inhibition by thio-GMP also seems to occur in patients treated with 6-mercaptopurine (6 MP); subsequently, this may lead to toxicity in these patients.","['0 (Sulfhydryl Compounds)', '85-32-5 (Guanosine Monophosphate)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', ""EC 3.1.3.5 (5'-Nucleotidase)"", 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The degradation of Mcl-1 can be blocked by proteasome inhibitors, suggesting a role for the ubiquitin proteasome pathway in apoptosis. Here, we demonstrate that Mcl-1 is ubiquinated at five lysines. Biochemical fractionation of cell extracts allowed us to identify a 482 kDa HECT-domain-containing ubiquitin ligase named Mule (Mcl-1 ubiquitin ligase E3) that is both required and sufficient for the polyubiquitination of Mcl-1. Mule also contains a region similar to the Bcl-2 homology region 3 (BH3) domain that allows Mule to specifically interact with Mcl-1. Elimination of Mule expression by RNA interference stabilizes Mcl-1 protein, resulting in an attenuation of the apoptosis induced by DNA-damage agents. Thus, Mule is a unique BH3-containing E3 ubiquitin ligase apical to Bcl-2 family proteins during DNA damage-induced apoptosis.","['0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (Ubiquitin)', 'EC 2.3.2.26 (HUWE1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)']",,,,['Cell. 2005 Jul 1;121(7):963-5.

Previously untreated and treated adult patients with aggressive lymphoma were enrolled onto this study. For the HDCT protocol, we developed the AECC regimen, a drug-only regimen consisting of etoposide, carboplatin, cyclophosphamide, and nimustine (ie, ACNU). Mobilized peripheral blood stem cells were used mainly as a source for ASCT and were used based on collection rates of CD34 cells. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-six patients were enrolled and assessed for this study. The median length of follow-up was 6.5 years, with a range of 0.2-12.5 years. Retrospective immunophenotypic examination indicated that the majority of the patients were diagnosed with B-cell lymphoma. RESULTS: Before HDCT, 37 patients still had disease (26 partial responses [PRs] and 11 cases of no response), and 19 patients exhibited a complete response (CR) before HDCT with ASCT. Among 56 patients, 37 (66%) exhibited a CR, including patients continuing their first CR and those experiencing a second or further CR, and 11 patients (19.6%) exhibited PR on HDCT with ASCT. Outcomes of patients without CR were significantly poorer than those of the patients with CR, and 7-year overall survival rates of patients with and without CR were 63% and 27.2%, respectively.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-four patients (CLL, n=16; low-grade NHL, n=18) were enrolled. The median number of previous treatments was 2. Patients received <or=6 cycles of fludarabine at 30 mg/m2 per day and cyclophosphamide at 300 mg/m2 per day on days 1-3 of a 28-day cycle. Patients were randomized to supportive care or to receive GM-CSF at 250 mg/m2 per day, starting 24 hours after completion of chemotherapy and continuing up to 48 hours before the next cycle. Those who had received >6 months of previous therapy with an alkylating agent or had preexisting cytopenias received a 25% dose reduction. Twenty-two patients (65%) were randomized to receive GM-CSF. Patients completed a median of 5 cycles of treatment (range, 1-6 cycles). Twenty-seven patients (80%) received >or=3 cycles of treatment and were evaluated for response. RESULTS: Seven patients (26%) exhibited a complete response; 6 of the 7 had low-grade NHL. Fourteen patients (52%) exhibited a partial response, and 6 patients (22%) had stable disease. Notably, 6 of the 7 patients who exhibited complete response and 9 of 14 patients with partial responses were randomized to the GM-CSF arm. The duration of response ranged from 4 months to 26 months. The toxicities were mainly hematologic. Nineteen patients (70%) experienced >or=1 episode of grade 3/4 neutropenia, but only 4 (15%) experienced febrile neutropenia; 3 of those patients were assigned to the GM-CSF arm. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of fludarabine and cyclophosphamide is a well-tolerated and effective treatment regimen for patients with relapsed CLL and low-grade NHL. A higher percentage of complete responses were noted in patients with low-grade NHL compared with patients with CLL. Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor did not seem to decrease the incidence of febrile neutropenia. However, the higher number of complete and partial responses noted on the GM-CSF arm is intriguing and warrants further investigation.","['83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among the mAbs under clinical development, anti-CD20 mAbs have been most extensively investigated and have shown definitive clinical efficacy. Rituximab is a genetically engineered chimeric anti-CD20 mAb, with mouse variable and human constant regions. Consecutive clinical trials conducted in the US, Europe and Japan have revealed that rituximab is a highly effective agent with acceptable toxicities against indolent and aggressive B cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (B-NHLs) as a single agent and in combination with cytotoxic drugs. A recent French Phase III study in elderly patients with untreated aggressive B-NHL suggested that the addition of rituximab to standard CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone) chemotherapy increases the complete response rate and prolongs event-free and overall survival. Lymphoma cells are inherently sensitive to radiation. The aim of radioimmunotherapy is to use the mAb to target radiation to lymphoma tissue while minimising toxicity to normal cells. The clinical trials of 90Y ibritumomab tiuxetan and (131)I tositumomab showed they have definitive efficacy in relapsed indolent B-NHL with acceptable toxicities. A recent comparative study in relapsed indolent B-NHL showed that 90Y ibritumomab tiuxetan produces higher response rates than rituximab. In addition, BL22, a recombinant anti-CD22 immunotoxin, showed significant efficacy in patients with chemotherapy-resistant hairy cell leukaemia. MAbs will have significant roles in the treatment of lymphoid malignancies in the future.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many haematological cancers are associated with bone marrow failure, either as a direct consequence of the disease or its treatment. Colony stimulating factors (CSFs) have been used to address the problems associated with the resulting cytopenias, however, concerns about the potential leukaemogenic effects of some of these CSFs led to a degree of initial hesitancy in usage, particularly in the management of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). This has now been largely overcome. Other limitations have included cost and side effect profiles (the latter particularly with the multilineage factors). There has been wide variation locally, nationally and internationally in the usage of GFs. The American Society of Clinical Oncologists (ASCO) attempted to rationalise the usage of GFs by producing a consensus document enumerating the evidence-based indications for use of GFs. There is little information on cost effectiveness, this remains an important issue for the future. Peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) has revolutionised the management of many malignant conditions and has contributed to the increased use of growth factors. Many other indications are emerging for GFs used singly or in combination. Current clinical applications of GFs include: i) amelioration of cytopenias following chemotherapy and stem cell transplantation, ii) chemotherapy dose maintenance and escalation, iii) chemosensitisation and modification of disease states, iv) optimisation of methods for mobilisation of progenitor stem cells, v) immunotherapy, and vi) as therapeutic targets for treatment of haematolgical malignancies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

New treatments are needed to increase the cure rate and life expectancy of patients. With the discovery of oncogenes, tumour suppressor genes and an understanding of their role in the development of the malignant disease, a new era of therapy has begun. Cancer is a manifestation of deregulated signalling pathways that mediate cell growth and programmed cell death. Protein kinases are essential elements in these signalling pathways. In the US, Novartis launched Gleevec (imantinib, STI-571) in May 2001 as the first anticancer drug whose mechanism of action is kinase inhibition. In Phase I trials, 23/24 patients with chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML) had complete remissions and the drug is relatively non-toxic. Herceptin (trastuzumab) is a monoclonal antibody (mAb) against a member of the growth factor receptor family (HER-2/neu) that was launched in 1998 by Genentech for the treatment of breast cancer. Trastuzumab has an excellent antitumour profile, particularly when used in combination with doxorubicin and paclitaxol. These drugs are pioneering the treatment of cancer based on the molecular understanding of the disease. Numerous drugs that target growth factor receptors and their signalling pathways are in advanced clinical trials. Herein, antibodies against receptors and small molecule inhibitors of kinases in signalling pathways will be summarised. Inter-disciplinary preclinical studies have identified chemicals that target specific kinases. We believe that clinical studies of these agents will yield new anticancer agents that target specific diseases and that are less toxic than current agents.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although some of their biological properties have been well documented, the molecular mechanisms underlying tumor progression or regression have not been completely elucidated. In this study, we characterized the growth behavior and immunophenotype of these two cell lines, and analyzed their gene profiles using a complementary deoxynucleic acid (cDNA) microarray composed of 514 immunologically relevant genes. Our data showed that the two cell lines exhibited quite dissimilar and contrasting growth characteristics when inoculated into syngeneic mice. P815 tumors grew unremittingly, while P198 tumors gradually regressed. From a molecular viewpoint, P815 cells showed a higher expression of genes promoting tumor growth, such as IGF-1, IL-8R, FGFR1, VEGF-A, and VEGF-B. On the other hand, P198 tumor cells expressed CD11b and CD80, which favor the recruitment of lymphocytes and antigen-presenting cells (APCs), as well as the elicitation of antitumor immunity. P198 tumor cells also depicted a higher expression of genes inhibiting tumor growth, such as TNF-alpha, SOCS-1, CIS1, 4-1BB, and GDF-10.

Can imatinib eradicate leukaemic stem cells? What are the dynamics of relapse due to imatinib resistance, which is caused by mutations in the ABL kinase domain? The precise understanding of how imatinib exerts its therapeutic effect in CML and the ability to measure disease burden by quantitative polymerase chain reaction provide an opportunity to develop a mathematical approach. We find that a four-compartment model, based on the known biology of haematopoietic differentiation, can explain the kinetics of the molecular response to imatinib in a 169-patient data set. Successful therapy leads to a biphasic exponential decline of leukaemic cells. The first slope of 0.05 per day represents the turnover rate of differentiated leukaemic cells, while the second slope of 0.008 per day represents the turnover rate of leukaemic progenitors. The model suggests that imatinib is a potent inhibitor of the production of differentiated leukaemic cells, but does not deplete leukaemic stem cells. We calculate the probability of developing imatinib resistance mutations and estimate the time until detection of resistance.

Of these patients, 24 had experienced radiation exposure due to the Chernobyl accident, and 29 were non-irradiated spontaneous AML cases and served as controls. AML1/ETO translocations were found in 9 of 29 spontaneous AML but only in 1 of 24 radiation-associated AML cases. This difference between translocation frequencies is statistically significant in the age-unstratified cohorts (p=0.015). Following age stratification, the difference becomes less pronounced but remains on borderline significance (p=0.053). AML1 mutation status was assessed in 5 clean-up workers at Chernobyl NPP with MDS, or AML following MDS, by direct sequencing of genomic DNA from the coding region (exon 3 through 8). In one patient who developed MDS following an acute radiation syndrome, a hexanucleotide duplication of CGGCAT in exon 8 was found, inserted after base position 1502.

Although PML/RARalpha interferes with the normal maturation of myeloid precursors to granulocytes, pharmacological doses of retinoic acid are sufficient to restore the differentiation processes. We designed an assay based on the Real-Time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to experimentally follow the differentiation response of leukemic cells even after short-time differentiating treatments. Amplifying CD11b, CD11c, and CD14 mRNAs, as specific markers of differentiation, by the real-time RT-PCR assay we could detect both retinoic acid (RA) and vitamin D3 and human transforming growth factor beta1 (VitD3/TGFbeta1) induced cellular maturation more precociously than the canonical flow-cytofluorimetric assay. Moreover, by amplifying CD14 mRNA it was possible to monitor the ability of PML/RARalpha oncoprotein to block VitD3/TGFbeta1 induced differentiation in U937-PR9 promonocytic inducible model systems.The proposed real-time quantitative RT-PCR approach is a reproducible and highly sensitive assay and can be considered a valid method to study both cellular maturation state and differentiation response.","['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', '1C6V77QF41 (Cholecalciferol)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To unveil the potential mechanism(s) underlying cellular transformation, we have investigated the effects of TLS-ERG on both gene transcription and RNA splicing. Here we show that the TLS protein forms complexes with RNA polymerase II (Pol II) and the serine-arginine family of splicing factors in vivo. Deletion analysis of TLS-ERG in both mouse L-G myeloid progenitor cells and NIH 3T3 fibroblasts revealed that the RNA Pol II-interacting domain of TLS-ERG resides within the first 173 amino acids. While TLS-ERG repressed expression of the luciferase reporter gene driven by glycoprotein IX promoter in L-G cells but not in NIH 3T3 cells, the fusion protein was able to affect splicing of the E1A reporter in NIH 3T3 cells but not in L-G cells. To identify potential target genes of TLS-ERG, the fusion protein and its mutants were stably expressed in both L-G and NIH 3T3 cells through retroviral transduction. Microarray analysis of RNA samples from these cells showed that TLS-ERG activates two different sets of genes sharing little similarity in the two cell lines.

Here, we demonstrate that the HTLV-1 pX splice-variant p30II markedly enhances the transforming potential of Myc and transcriptionally activates the human cyclin D2 promoter, dependent upon its conserved Myc-responsive E-box enhancer elements, which are associated with increased S-phase entry and multinucleation. Enhancement of c-Myc transforming activity by HTLV-1 p30II is dependent upon the transcriptional coactivators, transforming transcriptional activator protein/p434 and TIP60, and it requires TIP60 histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity and correlates with the stabilization of HTLV-1 p30II/Myc-TIP60 chromatin-remodeling complexes. The p30II oncoprotein colocalizes and coimmunoprecipitates with Myc-TIP60 complexes in cultured HTLV-1-infected ATLL patient lymphocytes. Amino acid residues 99 to 154 within HTLV-1 p30II interact with the TIP60 HAT, and p30II transcriptionally activates numerous cellular genes in a TIP60-dependent or TIP60-independent manner, as determined by microarray gene expression analyses.

However, NF1 mutations are not common in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Given that the RUNX1 transcription factor is the most common target for chromosomal translocations in acute leukemia, we asked if NF1 might be regulated by RUNX1. In reporter assays, RUNX1 activated the NF1 promoter and cooperated with C/EBPalpha and ETS2 to activate the NF1 promoter over 80-fold. Moreover, the t(8;21) fusion protein RUNX1-MTG8 (R/M), which represses RUNX1-regulated genes, actively repressed the NF1 promoter. R/M associated with the NF1 promoter in vivo and repressed endogenous NF1 gene expression. In addition, similar to loss of NF1, R/M expression enhanced the sensitivity of primary myeloid progenitor cells to granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. Our results indicate that the NF1 tumor suppressor gene is a direct transcriptional target of RUNX1 and the t(8;21) fusion protein, suggesting that suppression of NF1 expression contributes to the molecular pathogenesis of AML.","['0 (AML1-ETO fusion protein, human)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Neurofibromin 1)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (RUNX1T1 protein, human)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Runx1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",,,,,"['R01 CA077274/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA087549/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA77274/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA74177/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA87549/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA068485/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA074177/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA64140/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA064140/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC1168824,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There were significant inverse associations between a history of both asthma and hay fever and overall cancer mortality (relative risk (RR) = 0.88, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.83, 0.93) and colorectal cancer mortality (RR = 0.76, 95% CI: 0.64, 0.91) in comparison with persons with neither of these allergic conditions. A history of hay fever only was associated with a significantly lowered risk of pancreatic cancer mortality, and a history of asthma only was associated with a significantly lowered risk of leukemia mortality. In never smokers, these associations persisted but were no longer significant. Results for mortality from cancer at other sites were less consistent.

Epub 2005 Jun 29.,"OBJECTIVES: To provide direct estimates of risk of cancer after protracted low doses of ionising radiation and to strengthen the scientific basis of radiation protection standards for environmental, occupational, and medical diagnostic exposures. DESIGN: Multinational retrospective cohort study of cancer mortality. SETTING: Cohorts of workers in the nuclear industry in 15 countries. PARTICIPANTS: 407 391 workers individually monitored for external radiation with a total follow-up of 5.2 million person years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Estimates of excess relative risks per sievert (Sv) of radiation dose for mortality from cancers other than leukaemia and from leukaemia excluding chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, the main causes of death considered by radiation protection authorities. RESULTS: The excess relative risk for cancers other than leukaemia was 0.97 per Sv, 95% confidence interval 0.14 to 1.97. Analyses of causes of death related or unrelated to smoking indicate that, although confounding by smoking may be present, it is unlikely to explain all of this increased risk. The excess relative risk for leukaemia excluding chronic lymphocytic leukaemia was 1.93 per Sv (< 0 to 8.47). On the basis of these estimates, 1-2% of deaths from cancer among workers in this cohort may be attributable to radiation. CONCLUSIONS: These estimates, from the largest study of nuclear workers ever conducted, are higher than, but statistically compatible with, the risk estimates used for current radiation protection standards. The results suggest that there is a small excess risk of cancer, even at the low doses and dose rates typically received by nuclear workers in this study.",,,20050629,,,['U50/CCU011778/CC/ODCDC CDC HHS/United States'],PMC558612,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2005 Jun 28.,"DEK is a mammalian protein that has been implicated in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases and cancer, including acute myeloid leukemia, melanoma, glioblastoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, and bladder cancer. In addition, DEK appears to participate in multiple cellular processes, including transcriptional repression, mRNA processing, and chromatin remodeling. Sub-nuclear distribution of this protein, with the attendant functional ramifications, has remained a controversial topic. Here we report that DEK undergoes acetylation in vivo at lysine residues within the first 70 N-terminal amino acids. Acetylation of DEK decreases its affinity for DNA elements within the promoter, which is consistent with the involvement of DEK in transcriptional repression. Furthermore, deacetylase inhibition results in accumulation of DEK within interchromatin granule clusters (IGCs), sub-nuclear structures that contain RNA processing factors. Overexpression of P/CAF acetylase drives DEK into IGCs, and addition of a newly developed, synthetic, cell-permeable P/CAF inhibitor blocks this movement. To our knowledge, this is the first reported example of acetylation playing a direct role in relocation of a protein to IGCs, and this may explain how DEK can function in multiple pathways that take place in distinct sub-nuclear compartments. These findings also suggest that DEK-associated malignancies and autoimmune diseases might be amenable to treatment with agents that alter acetylation.","['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone)', '0 (Dek protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Poly-ADP-Ribose Binding Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.3.1.- (Acetyltransferases)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (CREB-Binding Protein)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (CREBBP protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (Histone Acetyltransferases)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (p300-CBP Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (p300-CBP-associated factor)']",,20050628,,,"['5P-60-DK20572/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'GM62437/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA07863/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA88784-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our objective is to analyze tumor gene expression data from microarrays in the context of such pathways. RESULTS: We use pathways compiled from the TRANSPATH/TRANSFAC databases and the literature, and three publicly available cancer microarray data sets. Variation in pathway activity, across the samples, is gauged by the degree of correlation between downstream targets of a pathway. Two correlation scores are applied; one considers all pairs of downstream targets, and the other considers only pairs without common transcription factors. Several pathways are found to be differentially active in the data sets using these scores. Moreover, we devise a score for pathway activity in individual samples, based on the average expression value of the downstream targets. Statistical significance is assigned to the scores using permutation of genes as null model. Hence, for individual samples, the status of a pathway is given as a sign, + or -, and a p-value. This approach defines a projection of high-dimensional gene expression data onto low-dimensional pathway activity scores. For each dataset and many pathways we find a much larger number of significant samples than expected by chance. Finally, we find that several sample-wise pathway activities are significantly associated with clinical classifications of the samples. CONCLUSION: This study shows that it is feasible to infer signal transduction pathway activity, in individual samples, from gene expression data. Furthermore, these pathway activities are biologically relevant in the three cancer data sets.",,,20050629,,,,PMC1184060,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nevertheless, some concerns exist about the duration of response to treatment and the onset of resistance to IM. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Twenty-five chronic-phase CML patients in stable CCR (>6 months) treated for at least 1 year with IM at the standard dose (400 mg/day) were mobilized with recombinant human granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor (Filgrastim) at 10 microg per kg for 4 to 6 days, with the aim of collecting at least 2 x 10(6) CD34+ cells per kg. Standard cytogenetic analysis and first-round and/or nested polymerase chain reaction were performed in basal and postmobilization samples to examine the presence of bcr-abl transcripts. RESULTS: CD34+ cells collection was successful in 16 patients, yielding a median of 3.01 x 10(6) +/- 1.09 x 10(6) CD34+ cells per kg at the first attempt, and in 4 of the 9 remaining patients who were remobilized after a temporary withdrawal of IM, yielding a median of 2.65 x 10(6) +/- 0.7 x 10(6) CD34+ cells per kg, with an overall 80 percent success rate.

In most countries, HTLV-I and -II screening is not performed systematically for blood donations. A new photochemical treatment (PCT) with a synthetic psoralen was developed to inactivate most pathogens in platelet (PLT) concentrates or plasma and to improve the safety of blood donations. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Cell-associated HTLV-I or -II (10(6)/mL) was inoculated in full-size fresh PLT concentrates or fresh frozen plasma and treated with 150 micromol per L amotosalen (S-59) and different doses of long-wavelength ultraviolet A (UVA) light. The residual viral titer in the treated samples was assessed by a cocultivation assay on indicator cells. RESULTS: The inactivation obtained at a 3.0 J per cm2 UVA dose was greater than 5.2 log foci-forming units (FFUs) per mL for HTLV-I and 4.6 log FFUs per mL for HTLV-II in presence of human PLT concentrates and greater than 4.5 log FFUs per mL for HTLV-I and 5.7 log FFUs per mL for HTLV-II in the presence of human plasma. The residual infectivity was very low and shown as the limit of detection of the cocultivation assay. CONCLUSION: In human plasma or PLT concentrates, the retroviruses HTLV-I and -II were strongly sensitive to the PCT with 150 micromol per L amotosalen (S-59) and a 3.0 J per cm2 UVA dose. This high efficiency for photoinactivation of these retroviruses opens a possibility of improving the safety of PLTs or plasma transfusion in the future.","['0 (Furocoumarins)', 'K1LDZ0VBC0 (amotosalen)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The resulting fusion gene, the BCR-ABL, is responsible for oncogenesis. Imatinib mesylate is a novel molecule, which inhibits the protein product of this fusion gene and hence has been used in the treatment of CML. The present study evaluates 174 patients with CML treated with imatinib mesylate. Of these 174 patients, 97 were in chronic phase, 47 in accelerated phase and 30 patients had blast crisis. Patients in chronic phase received imatinib mesylate in the dose of 400-mg daily, while those in accelerated phase and blast crisis received 600 to 800 mg daily. Of the 97 patients with chronic phase, 49 patients (50.5%) achieved a major (major + complete) cytogenetic response. Of the 47 patients in accelerated phase, 10 patients (21.3%) achieved a major cytogenetic response and in 30 patients with blast crisis, 7 (23.3%) achieved a major cytogenetic response. Dermatitis, mucositis, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia were some of the major toxicities. Of interest, 121 of the 174 patients (69.5%) developed generalized hypopigmentation.

We undertook a systematic review of published studies investigating the association between breast-feeding and childhood cancers using Medline (1966 to June 2004), supplemented with auto alerts and manual searches. Analyses are based on odds ratios for specific cancers among those ever breast-fed compared with those never breast-fed, pooled using random-effects models. Forty-nine publications were potentially relevant; of these, 26 provided odds ratio estimates for at least one childhood cancer outcome and were included in metaanalyses. Overall, 92% of the studies were case-control studies, 85% relied on long-term recall of feeding history, only 8% examined breast-feeding exclusivity and control response rates were under 80% in over half. Metaanalyses suggested lower risks associated with having been breast-fed of 9% (95% CI = 2-16%) for acute lymphoblastic leukemia, 24% (3-40%) for Hodgkin's disease and 41% (22-56%) for neuroblastoma, with little between-study heterogeneity. The estimates for Hodgkin's disease and neuroblastoma, however, were driven by single studies. There was little evidence that breast-feeding was associated with acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, central nervous system cancers, malignant germ cell tumors, juvenile bone tumors, or other solid cancers. In conclusion, ever having been breast-fed is inversely associated with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, Hodgkin's disease and neuroblastoma in childhood, but noncausal explanations are possible. Even if causal, the public health importance of these associations may be small. Our estimates suggest that increasing breast-feeding from 50% to 100% would prevent at most 5% of cases of childhood acute leukemia or lymphoma. (c) 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",,69,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Materials and methods A nested case-control study was conducted, using data linkage between the RNZCGP Research Unit database and the New Zealand Hospital Separation Diagnosis database. Cancer related hospital admissions were identified between 1998 and 2002, and prior antibiotic exposure in these patients was then found. Results A total of 6678 patients were identified with a newly diagnosed cancer in this time period. A slightly increased odds ratio (OR) (95% CI) for breast cancer was seen with penicillin, 1.07 (1.02-1.13). Penicillin was also associated with an increased OR with lung and respiratory cancer, 1.13 (1.06-1.21), and skin neoplasms, 1.05 (1.02-1.08). Significant associations were seen between macrolides and leukaemia, 1.15 (1.01-1.30), lung and respiratory cancers, 1.23 (1.10-1.38) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, 1.26 (1.02-1.55).

METHODS: We analysed data obtained from a population-based case-control study conducted in eight Canadian provinces. Risk estimates were generated by applying multivariate logistic regression methods to 1068 incident histologically confirmed leukemia cases and 5039 controls aged 20-74. RESULTS: We found a statistically significant increased risk for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) associated with active smoking, with a clear dose-response relationship and an adjusted odds ratio (OR) of 1.5 (95% confidence interval [CI]=1.1-2.0) for heavy smokers reporting more than 20 pack-years of cigarette smoking. We also observed positive associations with the highest body mass index (BMI) for AML, chronic myeloid leukemia, and chronic lymphoid leukemia with a significant dose-response relationship. No association with leukemia was observed for the intake of fruits and vegetables, and the effect of active smoking on adult leukemia risk was not modified by fruits and/or vegetables consumption or obesity. However, the positive risk for AML associated with active smoking disappeared among subjects with high BMI (> or =30 kg/m2).

In addition to other self-reported cancer risk factors, participants were asked about current and former use of HRT in 1986 and on four subsequent follow-up questionnaires. A total of 201 cases of leukemia were identified over 16 years of follow-up including 74 acute myeloid leukemias (AMLs) and 87 chronic lymphocytic leukemias (CLLs). RESULTS: Compared to never users of HRT at study baseline, current [multivariate relative risk (RR), 1.09; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.70-1.71)] and former users (RR=0.82, 95% CI=0.59-1.15) were at no increased risk of developing leukemia. For AML, current users also had no increased risk (RR=0.83, 95% CI=0.37-1.84) and there was a suggestion that former users had a slightly decreased risk (RR=0.66, 95% CI=0.37-1.17).

METHODS: Analyses of fifteen common cancer sites were undertaken to examine the occurrence of multiple primaries. These cancers were notified to the South Australian Cancer Registry during 1977-2001. Historic cohort models were used where standardised incidence ratios (95 confidence limits) were calculated to indicate the risk of second primary cancers. RESULTS: New associations detected included an increased risk of cancers of the bladder, colon, rectum, kidney and melanomas following a diagnosis of prostate cancer and an increased risk of leukaemia following both lung and rectal cancer. Many previously identified combinations of multiple primaries were confirmed. CONCLUSIONS: From the wide range of associations identified, some such as leukaemias occurring as second primaries after the diagnosis of ovarian cancers and lymphomas may be a treatment effect. The diagnosis of multiple primary cancers in the same month (e.g. bladder-prostate cancers and ovarian-uterine cancers) may reflect patterns of medical testing and the long preclinical phases of some cancers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

AIM: Our aim was to evaluate the usefulness of CD45 expression in the immunological classification of BCLPDs. SETTING AND DESIGN: A prospective study was set in a university hospital to investigate the CD45 intensity, particularly in B-CLL. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The expression of CD45 in 37 patients with BCLPD including typical B-CLL (Group I), atypical B-CLL and CLL/PLL (II), and hairy cell leukemia (HCL), B-prolymphocytic leukemia (B-PLL), and B-non Hodgkin's lymphoma (B-NHL) as non-CLL BCLPDs (III) and in eight healthy age matched controls (IV) was quantitatively compared by flow cytometric CD45/RALS gating strategy. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: The mean, median, and peak channel scores of CD45 obtained for the four groups were compared using one-way analysis of variance test. A P value RESULTS: Lower CD45 density is associated highly with typical CLL and differences between typical CLL and other groups were significant (P< 0.001, 0.001, and 0.001). Non-CLL cases had significantly brighter CD45 expression than atypical CLL (P=0.014). No differences were found between normal lymphocytes and non-CLL BCLPD cases. CONCLUSIONS: CD45 is a useful marker, to discriminate the typical CLL from the non-CLL BCLPD and from atypical CLL.","['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (PTPRCAP protein, human)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

No or very little influence of the exposure of HL-60 cells to amifostine (10(-6) to 10(-2) M) on cell proliferation was shown. Proliferation of HL-60 cells exposed to doxorubicin, cytarabine, or etoposide dropped down with increasing doses of these drugs. Only in the case of doxorubicin, more effective inhibition of HL-60 cell growth was observed when combination of doxorubicin, cytarabine or etoposide with amifostine was used. Cytotoxic effect of cytarabine or etoposide was not reduced by amifostine. The lowering of the cytotoxic index (IC50) was observed only when HL-60 cells were preincubated with amifostine followed by doxorubicin treatment. IC50 was estimated as 2.1 x 10(-7) M and 0.9 x 10(-7) M for doxorubicin and doxorubicin with amifostine, respectively. This effect was accompanied by the induction of caspase 3 activity. HL-60 cells treated with doxorubicin alone showed about 35-fold increase in caspase 3 activity. The enzyme activity was stimulated by combination of doxorubicin with amifostine up to 94 times. Furthermore, the expression of bcl-2 and bax genes involved in apoptosis as well as tumor-associated p65 gene were determined. Semiquantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction showed a decrease in bcl-2 and an increase in bax and p65 expression in HL-60 cells treated with doxorubicin in combination with amifostine when compared with the cells treated only with doxorubicin. Amifostine may potentiate doxorubicin therapeutic efficiency in human acute promyelocytic leukemia cells.","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Transcription Factor RelA)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'M487QF2F4V (Amifostine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2005 Jun 28.,"Self-renewal and differentiation of embryonic stem (ES) cells are regulated by cytokines and growth factors through tyrosine kinase-dependent signaling pathways. In murine ES cells, signals for self-renewal are generated by the leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). LIF and other growth factors are linked to the activation of the Src family of cytoplasmic protein-tyrosine kinases (SFKs), which consists of eight members having shared structural architecture. In this article, we show that murine ES cells express seven SFKs, three of which (Hck, Src, and Fyn) exhibit constitutive activity in self-renewing ES cells. Differentiation of ES cells to embryoid bodies was associated with rapid transcriptional silencing of Hck and Lck and with the loss of the corresponding kinase proteins. The expression of other family members remained relatively constant, although some loss of Fgr and Lyn proteins was observed during differentiation. Like ES cells, embryoid bodies maintained constitutive Src and Fyn kinase activity. Partial inhibition of endogenous SFK activity with the ATP-competitive inhibitors 4-amino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine or Src kinase inhibitor-1 induced differentiation of ES cells in the presence of LIF. In contrast, suppression of all SFK activity with higher concentrations of these inhibitors, or with the more potent compound A-419259 (Bioorg Med Chem Lett 12:1683-1686, 2002) blocked differentiation in response to LIF withdrawal. It is surprising that these inhibitor-treated cells remained pluripotent despite the absence of LIF. Our results implicate individual members of the Src kinase family in distinct ES cell renewal and differentiation pathways and show that small-molecule SFK inhibitors can control ES cell fate.","['0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)']",,20050628,,['Mol Pharmacol. 2005 Nov;68(5):1193-5.

To identify novel C/EBP-target genes, we performed transcriptional profiling using inducible NIH 3T3 cell lines expressing 1 of 4 members of the C/EBP family. Functional analysis revealed a previously unknown link between C/EBP proteins and circadian clock genes. Our microarray data showed that the expression levels of 2 core components of the circadian network, Per2 and Rev-Erbalpha, were significantly altered by C/EBPs. Recent studies suggested that Per2 behaves as a tumor suppressor gene in mice. Therefore, we focused our additional studies on Per2. We showed that Per2 expression is up-regulated by C/EBPalpha and C/EBPepsilon. Per2 levels were reduced in lymphoma cell lines and in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patient samples. In addition, we generated stable K562 cells that expressed an inducible Per2 gene. Induction of Per2 expression resulted in growth inhibition, cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and loss of clonogenic ability. These results suggest that Per2 is a downstream C/EBPalpha-target gene involved in AML, and its disruption might be involved in initiation and/or progression of AML.","['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (PER2 protein, human)', '0 (Per2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Period Circadian Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",,20050628,,,,PMC1895299,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This induction was observed in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), immortalized keratinocyte, and colon cancer cell lines, as well as normal human bone marrow (BM) -derived macrophages and fresh BM cells from two normal individuals and one AML patient.

Epub 2005 Jun 28.,"Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) is a pleiotropic cytokine belonging to the gp130 family. LIF is induced peripherally and within the brain during inflammatory or chronic autoimmune diseases and is a potent stimulator of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Here we investigated the role of LIF in mediating glucocorticoid receptor (GR) expression in the HPA axis. LIF treatment (3 microg/mouse, i.p.) markedly decreased GR mRNA levels in murine hypothalamus (5-fold, P < 0.01) and pituitary (1.7-fold, P < 0.01) and downregulated GR protein levels. LIF decreased GR expression in murine corticotroph cell line AtT20 within 2 h, and this effect was sustained for 8 h after treatment. LIF-induced GR mRNA reduction was abrogated in AtT20 cells overexpressing dominant-negative mutants of STAT3, indicating that intact JAK-STAT signaling is required to mediate LIF effects on GR expression. Conversely, mice with LIF deficiency exhibited increased GR mRNA levels in the hypothalamus and pituitary (3.5- and 3.5-fold, respectively; P < 0.01 for both) and increased GR protein expression when compared with wild-type littermates. The suppressive effects of dexamethasone on GR were more pronounced in LIF-null animals. These data suggest that LIF maintains the HPA axis activation by decreasing GR expression and raise the possibility that LIF might contribute to the development of central glucocorticoid resistance during inflammation.","['0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Glucocorticoid)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Jak1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 1)']",,20050628,,,['DK-54862/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Date of engraftment is defined as the first of at least 3 consecutive dates of absolute neutrophil count >500/mm(3) after stem cell infusion. BSI severity grades: severe (intravenous antibiotics), life threatening (sepsis), or fatal (caused or contributed to death). Results. The incidence of pre- and post-engraftment BSI was 22% and 19.5%, respectively. Pre-engraftment highest rates were observed for viridans streptococci (58), Enterobacteriaceae (39), and Enterococcus faecium (34). Post-engraftment rates ranged from 0.2 to 2.9 without any predominant pathogen. In multivariate analyses, pre-engraftment BSI was associated with diagnosis of chronic myelogenous leukemia, age >18 years and peripheral blood stem cell graft; post-engraftment BSI was associated with acute graft-versus-host disease, neutropenia, and liver or kidney dysfunction. Attributable mortality was 12.5% and 1.7% for pre- and post-engraftment BSI, respectively. BSI fatality rates were 24% for viridans streptococci, 8% for E. faecium, 11% for Staphylococcus aureus, and 67% for Candida. Conclusions. Pre-engraftment BSI, especially by viridans streptococci and E. faecium, was associated with substantial attributable mortality.

Based on a simple theoretical model, according to the vital characteristics of the leukemic clone (proliferative rate and resistance to apoptosis) we propose a classification of AML into two broad categories: a) high leukemic clone vitality (HLV) AML, corresponding roughly to the World Health Organization (WHO) classification group of entities ""AML with recurrent cytogenetic abnormalities"" and b) low leukemic clone vitality (LLV) or ""opportunistic"" AML corresponding to the WHO groups ""AML with multilineage dysplasia"" and ""therapy-related AML"". HLV-AML leukemic clones are characterized by rate-limiting genomic mutations capable of conferring proliferation/survival advantage over a normal hematopoietic environment while in LLV-AML, the leukemic clones are not particularly proliferative or apoptosis-resistant, but are nevertheless selected against an impaired, previously damaged hematopoietic environment. Such a pathogenesis-oriented classification might have therapeutic and prognostic implications, providing a theoretical basis for a further adaptation of the current standard treatment strategies to the individual characteristics of the AML patients.",,24,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We examined whether montelukast inhibits the activation of NF-kappaB, a transcription factor that regulates the expression of proinflammatory molecules. The inhibitory effects of montelukast on tumor necrosis factor kappa (TNF-kappa)--induced NF-kappaB activation on THP-1 cells, a human monocytic leukemia cell line, were evaluated by flow cytometry, and those on lipopolysaccharide-induced interleukin 1beta (IL-1beta), IL-6, TNF-alpha, and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) production in peripheral blood mononuclear cells were evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: Flow cytometry demonstrated that montelukast inhibited NF-kappaB activation in THP-1 cells in a dose-related manner. Furthermore, 10(-5)M montelukast significantly inhibited lipopolysaccharide-induced IL-6, TNF-alpha, and MCP-1 production in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of controls and patients with asthma. Lipopolysaccharide-induced IL-1beta production was not inhibited by montelukast. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that high doses of montelukast modulate the production of IL-6, TNF-alpha, and MCP-1 through the inhibition of NF-kappaB activation. However, the anti-inflammatory effect of montelukast at therapeutic doses in patients with asthma needs to be further investigated.","['0 (Acetates)', '0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents)', '0 (Chemokine CCL2)', '0 (Cyclopropanes)', '0 (Inflammation Mediators)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukotriene Antagonists)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Quinolines)', '0 (Sulfides)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', 'MHM278SD3E (montelukast)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has been noticed that the sensitivity to apoptosis induced by As(2)O(3 )varies among various leukemia cells. It was reported by several groups that As(2)O(3) could induce apoptosis in APL-derived NB4 cells at concentrations of 0.5-1 mumol/l, whereas in other leukemia cells like K562, As(2)O(3) has no effects at the same concentration. K562 cells undergo apoptosis only when the concentration of As(2)O(3 )is greater than 2 mumol/l. Another arsenic compound, realgar (As(4)S(4)), a traditional Chinese mineral medicine, has been used to treat APL effectively and demonstrated to have lower toxicity than As(2)O(3). It would be interesting to know whether NB4 and K562 cells will show different sensitivity to realgar as well and if there is a difference, what is the cellular mechanism of it. In our present study, K562 cells were much less sensitive than NB4 cells to apoptosis induced by realgar. We confirm that the expression of bcl-x(L) is significantly higher in K562 cells than that in NB4 cells and is not downregulated upon realgar treatment. K562 cells become sensitive to realgar at clinically acceptable concentrations when bcl-x(L) expression level is downregulated by transfecting bcl-x(L) antisense RNA vector into the cells. Our results suggest that the increased bcl-x(L) expression in K562 cells contributes to its insensitivity to realgar-induced apoptosis.","['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Sulfides)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '56320-22-0 (arsenic disulfide)']",,,"['Copyright (c) 2005 S.

In the present analysis, we describe a series of adult ALL patients consecutively treated with the same regimen in order to analyse prognostic factors and treatment outcome as well as to define new risk-oriented strategies. DESIGN AND METHODS: From 1990 to 1998, 102 newly diagnosed ALL patients were referred to our division, 83 of them were eligible for the present study. Median age was 31 years (range 13-76); 77.1% had B-lineage ALL and 22.9% T-lineage ALL; 36.1% showed associated myeloid markers. All patients received an induction phase treatment, consisting of a 4-week cycle with vincristine, daunorubicin, L-asparaginase and desametasone; the consolidation phase included cyclophosphamide, cytarabine, 6-mercaptopurine and central nervous system (CNS) prophylaxis, followed by three of months maintenance (methotrexate + 6-mercaptopurine), re-induction (4-week cycle with vincristine, adriamicin, desametasone), and 2-year maintenance with methotrexate + 6-mercaptopurine. RESULTS: Complete remission (CR) was achieved in 66 patients (79.5%); 20.5% of patients were resistant. The relapse rate was 60.2%. There were 10 CNS relapses (accounting for 12% of all patients, 15% of all CRs and 20% of all relapses). One patient had an ovarian and 2 had a breast relapse. Eleven patients remained in first continuous CR after chemotherapy. Median overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were 1.8 and 1.0 years, respectively, with a median follow-up of 5.6 years (range 0.3-12.1). Initial white blood cell count </=30 x 10(9)/l, age <35 years, and time to complete remission </=40 days were the most significant prognostic factors for OS (p < 0.05). These three characteristics defined a group of patients with a better prognosis (5-year OS: 58%). They represented, however, only 18% in this series of adult patients. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: In our cohort, we were able to define a small subgroup of adult ALL patients with a better outcome. However, the majority of patients is at a high risk of failure when treated with standard protocols. There is a need for new, more active regimens for these patients.",,,,"['Copyright (c) 2005 S.

More aggressive diseases, like acute myeloid or lymphoblastic leukemia, were included in the CST group, while the RIST group included more indolent diseases, like chronic myeloid leukemia or myeloma (p < 0.001). The incidence of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) grades 2-4 was 29.1 and 57.9% for the RIST and CST groups, respectively (p = 0.010), yet the incidence of chronic GVHD was similar in the two groups (57.4 vs. 71.9%).

In a multivariate analysis, RIST (p = 0.010), good performance status (p = 0.006) and a higher CD34+ cell dose (p = 0.008) were all identified as independent favorable prognostic factors for OS.

We previously showed that mutations which dissociate the ability of C/EBP alpha to block cell cycle progression through E2F inhibition from its function as a transcriptional activator impair the in vivo development of the neutrophil granulocyte and adipose lineages. We now show that such mutations increase the capacity of bone marrow (BM) myeloid progenitors to proliferate, and predispose mice to a granulocytic myeloproliferative disorder and transformation of the myeloid compartment of the BM. Both of these phenotypes were transplantable into lethally irradiated recipients. BM transformation was characterized by a block in granulocyte differentiation, accumulation of myeloblasts and promyelocytes, and expansion of myeloid progenitor populations--all characteristics of AML. Circulating myeloblasts and hepatic leukocyte infiltration were observed, but thrombocytopenia, anemia, and elevated leukocyte count--normally associated with AML-were absent. These results show that disrupting the cell cycle regulatory function of C/EBP alpha is sufficient to initiate AML-like transformation of the granulocytic lineage, but only partially the peripheral pathology of AML.",['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha)'],,20050627,,,,PMC2212897,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A retrospective study was made, including children treated for a febrile neutropenic episode (absolute neutrophile count < 0.5 x 10(9)/l) by a piperacillin-tazobactam-netilmicin combination. If fever persisted 48 hours after the beginning of antibiotic therapy, a glycopeptide could be added. The responses to the treatment were defined as follows: 1) total success (no fever or documented infection) at 48 hours and at 72 hours following the beginning of treatment; 2) partial success (apyrexia beyond 72 hours without any therapeutic change); 3) failure (persistent infectious signs 48 hours after the introduction of glycopeptide). RESULTS: Sixty-nine episodes were assessable, corresponding to 41 patients, treated for a solid tumour (29), an acute leukaemia in remission (11), or a metabolic disease (1). The febrile episodes were divided into fever of unknown origin (71%), microbiologically documented fever (12%), and clinically documented fever (17%). No death occurred, no toxicity was reported. With this antibiotic therapy, total success at 72 hours was observed in 72% in case of fever of unknown origin and 45% in case of documented infections. The success rate reached 84% when a glycopeptide was added (30% of the cases). CONCLUSION: The piperacillin-tazobactam-netilmicin combination is very effective and well tolerated in probabilistic treatment of febrile neutropenia induced by chemotherapy, but does not allow to decreasing the frequency of glycopeptide administration.","['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Drug Combinations)', '157044-21-8 (Piperacillin, Tazobactam Drug Combination)', '4O5J85GJJB (Netilmicin)', '87-53-6 (Penicillanic Acid)', 'X00B0D5O0E (Piperacillin)']",23,,,,,,,Traitement des episodes de neutropenie febrile chimio-induite de l'enfant par l'association piperacilline-tazobactam et netilmicine.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2005 Jun 27.,"Meisoindigo, an active compound of a Chinese anti-leukemia medicine, has been effectively used in the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). Increasing evidences have demonstrated that angiogenesis is an important pathobiologic feature of CML. The anti-angiogenesis effect of meisoindigo on CML is unknown. In this study, we determined the effects of meisoindigo on the apoptosis, adherence and differentiation of endothelial cells as well as the secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) by CML cells. We found that VEGF level, measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), was higher in bone marrow plasma from CML patients compared with the healthy controls (334.83+/-23.09 ng/L versus 102.36+/-38.76 ng/L, P<0.01). CML cell VEGF production was decreased after CML cells were treated with 10 micromol/L meisoindigo compared with the controls (212.10+/-46.13 ng/L versus 293.75+/-64.79 ng/L, P<0.05). Ten micromole per liter of meisoindigo could induce time-dependent apoptosis of ECV304 cells determined by annexin-V. Treatment of ECV304 cells with meisoindigo for 48 h reduced the number of adherent cells and the expression of VCAM-1 compared with the control cells (43.78+/-9.09% versus 73.51+/-3.21%, P<0.05). Meisoindigo also inhibited tubule formation of HUVECs in an in vitro Matrigel after HUVECs were incubated with meisoindigo for 6 h. Our findings suggest that meisoindigo could inhibit angiogeneic process through decreasing the VEGF secretion in leukemic cells and also through inhibiting the proliferation, adhesion and differentiation of endothelial cells, causing the interruption of a reciprocal stimulatory loop between leukemic and endothelial cells. This effect may contribute to the anti-leukemic effect of this drug.","['0 (Angiogenesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (VEGFA protein, human)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '97207-47-1 (N-methylisoindigotin)']",,20050627,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2005 Jun 27.,"Multidrug resistance (MDR) is the main reason for failure of cancer therapy with resistance to apoptosis being one of the mechanisms involved. Constitutive NF-kappaB activity has been detected in many tumors contributing to oncogenesis and tumor survival whereas inhibition of NF-kappaB activity has proved to enhance cell death induced by chemotherapeutic agents. Consequently, the use of BAY 11-7082, an irreversible inhibitor of IkappaB-alpha phosphorylation, could be beneficial in the treatment of certain tumors. Although there are several reports which demonstrate a transient activation of NF-kappaB by cytotoxic drugs, little is known about the role of NF-kappaB activation in the development of a chemoresistant phenotype in leukemic cells. In this study, we analyzed the relationship between NF-kappaB and the survival of murine leukemic drug resistant cell lines. The modulation of this transcription factor by BAY 11-7082 and the chemotherapeutic agents vincristine and doxorubicin was evaluated. The effect of BAY 11-7082 on the expression of genes containing NF-kappaB-binding sites was also studied. We found that the cell lines LBR-V160 and LBR-D160 (resistant to vincristine and doxorubicin, respectively) presented higher constitutive NF-kappaB activity than the sensitive LBR- and the active complex contained both p50 and p65 subunits. BAY 11-7082 (3.5 microM) inhibited constitutive NF-kappaB activity in the three cell lines whereas the anticancer agents did not. Treatment with BAY 11-7082 induced a higher percentage of apoptosis in LBR-V160 and LBR-D160 than in LBR-. Cells treated with BAY 11-7082 displayed modulation of NF-kappaB-inducible genes such as IL-10, IL-15, TNF-alpha and TGF-beta. Taken together, these data suggest that suppression of constitutive NF-kappaB activity by BAY 11-7082 may be a useful treatment for MDR leukemias.","['0 (3-(4-methylphenylsulfonyl)-2-propenenitrile)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (NF-kappa B p50 Subunit)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Sulfones)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",,20050627,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our data demonstrate that AZT, at concentrations comparable to those reached in the blood of HIV-infected patients under pharmacological treatment with this drug, can increase the toxicity of TS in cooperation with CQ inducing an increased effect on protein synthesis in K562 cells ( approximately 50% inhibition of protein synthesis for TS alone, and TS with AZT and approximately 70% with both AZT and CQ).

The guanine nucleotide exchange factor for the small GTPase Rap1, C3G, binds constitutively to Crkl. Here, we report that Crkl mediates the formation of protein complexes that include C3G and Bcr/Abl. These complexes contain highly elevated levels of tyrosine-phosphorylated C3G and P130Cas, a scaffolding protein. Moreover, the presence of Rap1 further promoted tyrosine phosphorylation of C3G and Cas. Co-expression of Crkl and C3G with Bcr/Abl generated increased levels of activated Rap1. In addition, lysates from leukemic cells of P190 BCR/ABL transgenic mice and of the myelogenous leukemia cell line K562 contained tyrosine-phosphorylated C3G and activated Rap1.

Thus, the NK cells in the repertoire are lytic against allogeneic targets that do not express their inhibitory KIR ligands.

In humans, AGP is a heavily glycosylated protein that undergoes several modifications of its glycan moiety during acute and chronic inflammatory pathologies. In this paper we present the feline AGPs (fAGP) glycan moiety modifications in the course of two prevalent feline diseases, the FIV (feline immunodeficiency virus) dependent feline acquired viral immunodeficiency and the feline leukemia virus (FeLV) associated lymphoma. The glycan moiety of fAGP was investigated by means of the binding of its oligosaccharides residues with specific lectins. Four lectins were used: Sambucus nigra agglutinin I and Maackia amurensis agglutinin lectins were used to detect sialic acid residues, Aleuria aurantia lectin was used to detect L-fucose residues and Concanavalin A was used to evaluate the degree of branching. It was found that fAGP undergoes several post-translational modifications of its glycan pattern: in particular the degree of sialylation is increased in FeLV-positive cats diagnosed with lymphoma, while FeLV-positive that did not presented any specific clinical signs cats do not present any increase of expression of sialic acid on the surface. Furthermore, FIV induced a modification of the glycan moiety of fAGP, which however varied widely among individuals. In order to determine the number and the position of oligosaccharide chains, the cDNA sequence of fAGP was also determined. The translation of the mature fAGP coding sequence gave rise to a sequence of 183 residues, with five potential N-glycosylation sites, but also with seven potential phosphorylation sites.","['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Lectins)', '0 (Orosomucoid)', '0 (Polysaccharides)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To study the clinical utility of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for IGH translocations, we reviewed 1032 patients with a presumptive diagnosis of CLL. Seventy-six (7%) patients had IGH translocations. Pathology and clinical data were available for the 24 patients evaluated at the Mayo Clinic. Ten (42%) patients had IGH/cyclin D1 fusion and were diagnosed with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). The immunophenotype was typical of MCL in three of these patients and atypical for MCL in seven patients. One patient had biclonal disease with typical MCL and CLL with IGH/BCL-2. Eleven (46%) patients had IGH/BCL-2 fusion including the patient with biclonal disease. Two of these patients had leukaemic phase follicular lymphoma and nine patients had CLL. The median progression-free survival of patients with CLL and IGH/BCL-2 translocation was 20.6 months. The two patients with IGH/BCL-3 fusion (one of these also had IGH/BCL-11a) had rapid disease progression. The IGH partner gene was not identified in two patients. We conclude that use of an IGH probe in FISH analysis of monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis improves diagnostic precision and could have prognostic value in patients with CLL.","['0 (B-Cell Lymphoma 3 Protein)', '0 (BCL3 protein, human)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Oligonucleotide Probes)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Analysis of variance and significance analysis of microarrays was used to identify discriminatory genes. A novel 50-gene set accurately identified all patients with ALL and AML and predicted for a diagnosis of AML in three patients with unclassified acute leukaemia. A unique gene set was derived for each of eight subtypes of acute leukaemia within our data set. A common profile for children with ALL with an ETV6-RUNX1 fusion, amplification or deletion of ETV6, amplification of RUNX1 or hyperdiploidy with an additional chromosome 21 was identified. This suggests that these rearrangements share a commonality in biological pathways that maintains the leukaemic state. The gene TERF2 was most highly expressed in this group of patients. Our analyses demonstrate that not only is microarray analysis the single most effective tool for the diagnosis of acute leukaemias of childhood but it has the ability to identify unique biological pathways.

The distinction between immature (lymphoblastic lymphoma/acute lymphoblastic leukaemia) and mature lymphoma is sometimes difficult. In this study, we evaluated anti-TdT antibody in the diagnosis and classification of these proliferations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 13 lesions were examined by immunohistochemistry: 4 B and T lymphoblastic lymphomas, 2 Burkitt's lymphomas, 5 B and T acute lymphoblastic leukemias and 2 acute monoblastic leukemias. RESULTS: TdT expression is specific of immature lymphoid proliferations (T or B lymphoblasts). TdT is not expressed by mature B or T cell lymphomas such as Burkitt's lymphomas. Significant numbers of cases of acute myeloblastic leukemias are TdT positive but could be easily distinguished from lymphoblastic proliferations. CONCLUSION: Anti-TdT antibody represents a useful marker for differentiating lymphoma/acute lymphoblastic leukemia from other lymphomas. This marker, available in routine diagnosis should be systematically included in the panel of antibodies used for immunophenotyping hematologic malignancies.","['0 (Antibodies)', 'EC 2.7.7.31 (DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase)']",,,,,,,,Interet diagnostique de l'anticorps anti-terminal desoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) en pathologie hematologique.,,,,,,,,,,,,

High-dose radio- and/or chemotherapy eradicate the hematopoietic system of the patient and induce sufficient immunosuppression to enable donor stem cell engraftment. The replacement of the recipient's immune system with that of the donor significantly contributes to the success of this treatment, since donor immune cells facilitate stem cell engraftment, provide protection from infections, and eliminate residual malignant or nonmalignant host hematopoiesis, thereby protecting from disease relapse in patients transplanted for leukemia or lymphoma (graft-versus-leukemia effect, GVL). Mediators of these beneficial effects are mature T cells within the stem cell graft. However, donor T cells can also attack host tissues and induce a life-threatening syndrome called graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). The challenge of allogeneic SCT is to find a balance between beneficial and harmful T cell effects, which at present is only insufficiently achieved by the use of immunosuppressive drugs. In the future, it might be possible to replace or support such medications by using the intrinsic regulatory capacity of the transplanted immune system, as represented by T cell subpopulations with suppressive activity, such as CD4+ CD25+ regulatory T (Treg) cells. In various mouse model systems, these cells have been shown to suppress GVHD while preserving the GVL effect.

We conducted a multicentre trial using an indigenous recombinant IFN-alpha-2b to evaluate its efficacy and toxicity in chronic phase CML. METHODS: Between September 2000 and August 2001, patients with chronic phase CML were recruited within 8 weeks of diagnosis at 7 centres in India. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of each participating Institute and Informed, written consent was obtained from all patients. All patients were given the study drug in a dose of 5 million units daily subcutaneously. Response and survival analyses were done with intent-to-treat analysis. RESULTS: One hundred and fourteen patients (75 men and 39 women) were included in the study. Their ages ranged from 18 to 62 years (median 37 years). Fifty-seven per cent of patients had a haematological response; complete response in 31.6% and partial response in 25.4%. The median time to achieve complete haematological response was 6 months (range 3-12 months). Cytogenetic response was seen in 39.4% of patients; complete in 1.8%, partial in 28% and minimal in 9.6%. The median time to achieve partial and complete cytogenetic response was 6 and 12 months, respectively. Nineteen patients had progression (blast crisis n=15, accelerated phase n=4) while on treatment. Two patients refused further treatment after the initial 4 weeks due to IFN-a toxicity, mainly bone pains and fever. The major toxic effects of treatment were fever (78%), fatigue (25.4%) and myalgia (52%). No patient died of toxicity. Currently, 95 patients are alive, 91 in the chronic phase and 4 in the accelerated phase. Four patients were lost to follow up and all 15 patients with blast crisis died of progressive disease at a median Interval of 6.5 months (range 1-15 months). The Kaplan-Meier probability of survival at 36 months was 76%. CONCLUSION: This study confirms the efficacy of the indigenous recombinant IFN-alpha-2b in chronic phase CML. The drug has a toxicity profile similar to that of other preparations.","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Interferon alpha-2)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",,,,,,,['Natl Med J India. 2005 May-Jun;18(3):130'],,,,,,,,,,,,,
